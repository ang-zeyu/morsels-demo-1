That if the Saxons had nothing to fear from  mis-government, the external causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and  manifest. The recent devastations committed by the Prussians furnished  a specimen of these. The horrors of war would always impend over them,  till Germany were seized and divided by Austrian and Prussian tyrants;  an event which he strongly suspected was at no great distance. But  setting these considerations aside, was it laudable to grasp at wealth  and power even when they were within our reach? Were not these the two  great sources of depravity? What security had he, that in this change  of place and condition, he should not degenerate into a tyrant and  voluptuary? Power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of  their tendency to deprave the possessor. He held them in abhorrence, not  only as instruments of misery to others, but to him on whom they  were conferred. Besides, riches were comparative, and was he not rich  already? He lived at present in the bosom of security and luxury. All  the instruments of pleasure, on which his reason or imagination set any  value, were within his reach. But these he must forego, for the sake of  advantages which, whatever were their value, were as yet uncertain. In  pursuit of an imaginary addition to his wealth, he must reduce himself  to poverty, he must exchange present certainties for what was distant  and contingent; for who knows not that the law is a system of expence,  delay and uncertainty? If he should embrace this scheme, it would lay  him under the necessity of making a voyage to Europe, and remaining for  a certain period, separate from his family. He must undergo the perils  and discomforts of the ocean; he must divest himself of all domestic  pleasures; he must deprive his wife of her companion, and his children  of a father and instructor, and all for what? For the ambiguous  advantages which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to bestow?  For a precarious possession in a land of turbulence and war? Advantages,  which will not certainly be gained, and of which the acquisition, if it  were sure, is necessarily distant.    Pleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its intrinsic benefits,  but, likewise, for other reasons. His abode at Leipsig made that country  appear to him like home. He was connected with this place by many social  ties. While there he had not escaped the amorous contagion. But the  lady, though her heart was impressed in his favor, was compelled to  bestow her hand upon another. Death had removed this impediment, and  he was now invited by the lady herself to return. This he was of course  determined to do, but was anxious to obtain the company of Wieland;  he could not bear to think of an eternal separation from his present  associates. Their interest, he thought, would be no less promoted by the  change than his own. Hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his  arguments and solicitations.    He knew that he could not hope for mine or his sister's ready  concurrence in this scheme. Should the subject be mentioned to us, we  should league our efforts against him, and strengthen that reluctance  in Wieland which already was sufficiently difficult to conquer. He,  therefore, anxiously concealed from us his purpose. If Wieland were  previously enlisted in his cause, he would find it a less difficult task  to overcome our aversion. My brother was silent on this subject, because  he believed himself in no danger of changing his opinion, and he was  willing to save us from any uneasiness. The mere mention of such  a scheme, and the possibility of his embracing it, he knew, would  considerably impair our tranquillity.    One day, about three weeks subsequent to the mysterious call, it was  agreed that the family should be my guests. Seldom had a day been passed  by us, of more serene enjoyment. Pleyel had promised us his company, but  we did not see him till the sun had nearly declined. He brought with  him a countenance that betokened disappointment and vexation. He did not  wait for our inquiries, but immediately explained the cause. Two days  before a packet had arrived from Hamburgh, by which he had flattered  himself with the expectation of receiving letters, but no letters had  arrived. I never saw him so much subdued by an untoward event. His  thoughts were employed in accounting for the silence of his friends.  He was seized with the torments of jealousy, and suspected nothing less  than the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his heart. The silence  must have been concerted. Her sickness, or absence, or death, would have  increased the certainty of some one's having written. No supposition  could be formed but that his mistress had grown indifferent, or that she  had transferred her affections to another. The miscarriage of a letter  was hardly within the reach of possibility. From Leipsig to Hamburgh,  and from Hamburgh hither, the conveyance was exposed to no hazard.    He had been so long detained in America chiefly in consequence of  Wieland's aversion to the scheme which he proposed. He now became more  impatient than ever to return to Europe. When he reflected that, by his  delays, he had probably forfeited the affections of his mistress, his  sensations amounted to agony. It only remained, by his speedy departure,  to repair, if possible, or prevent so intolerable an evil. Already he  had half resolved to embark in this very ship which, he was informed,  would set out in a few weeks on her return.    Meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to shake the resolution of  Wieland. The evening was somewhat advanced when he invited the latter  to walk abroad with him. The invitation was accepted, and they left  Catharine, Louisa and me, to amuse ourselves by the best means in our  power. During this walk, Pleyel renewed the subject that was nearest  his heart. He re-urged all his former arguments, and placed them in more  forcible lights.    They promised to return shortly; but hour after hour passed, and they  made not their appearance. Engaged in sprightly conversation, it was not  till the clock struck twelve that we were reminded of the lapse of time.  The absence of our friends excited some uneasy apprehensions. We were  expressing our fears, and comparing our conjectures as to what might be  the cause, when they entered together. There were indications in their  countenances that struck me mute. These were unnoticed by Catharine, who  was eager to express her surprize and curiosity at the length of their  walk. As they listened to her, I remarked that their surprize was not  less than ours. They gazed in silence on each other, and on her. I  watched their looks, but could not understand the emotions that were  written in them.    These appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries into a new channel.  What did they mean, she asked, by their silence, and by their thus  gazing wildly at each other, and at her? Pleyel profited by this hint,  and assuming an air of indifference, framed some trifling excuse, at the  same time darting significant glances at Wieland, as if to caution him  against disclosing the truth. My brother said nothing, but delivered  himself up to meditation. I likewise was silent, but burned with  impatience to fathom this mystery. Presently my brother and his wife,  and Louisa, returned home. Pleyel proposed, of his own accord, to be  my guest for the night. This circumstance, in addition to those which  preceded, gave new edge to my wonder.    As soon as we were left alone, Pleyel's countenance assumed an air of  seriousness, and even consternation, which I had never before beheld in  him. The steps with which he measured the floor betokened the trouble of  his thoughts. My inquiries were suspended by the hope that he would give  me the information that I wanted without the importunity of questions.  I waited some time, but the confusion of his thoughts appeared in no  degree to abate. At length I mentioned the apprehensions which their  unusual absence had occasioned, and which were increased by their  behaviour since their return, and solicited an explanation. He stopped  when I began to speak, and looked stedfastly at me. When I had done,  he said, to me, in a tone which faultered through the vehemence of his  emotions, \"How were you employed during our absence?\" \"In turning over  the Della Crusca dictionary, and talking on different subjects; but  just before your entrance, we were tormenting ourselves with omens and  prognosticks relative to your absence.\" \"Catherine was with you the  whole time?\" \"Yes.\" \"But are you sure?\" \"Most sure. She was not absent a  moment.\" He stood, for a time, as if to assure himself of my sincerity.  Then, clinching his hands, and wildly lifting them above his head, \"Lo,\"  cried he, \"I have news to tell you. The Baroness de Stolberg is dead?\"    This was her whom he loved. I was not surprised at the agitations which  he betrayed. \"But how was the information procured? How was the truth  of this news connected with the circumstance of Catharine's remaining in  our company?\" He was for some time inattentive to my questions. When he  spoke, it seemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had  been plunged.    \"And yet it might be a mere deception. But could both of us in that  case have been deceived? A rare and prodigious coincidence! Barely not  impossible. And yet, if the accent be oracular--Theresa is dead. No,  no,\" continued he, covering his face with his hands, and in a tone half  broken into sobs, \"I cannot believe it. She has not written, but if  she were dead, the faithful Bertrand would have given me the earliest  information. And yet if he knew his master, he must have easily guessed  at the effect of such tidings. In pity to me he was silent.\"    \"Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is mysterious.

In other places, they stept from stone to stone, down  steep descents, where the riders were obliged to lie backwards flat upon  the cruppers.    Over all these difficulties, our guide urged his donkey gaily and  unconcernedly. As for myself, though I have seen plenty of rough riding,  and am as ready as most men to follow, if not to lead, I thought it no  shame to dismount more than once. The rolling of a stone, or the parting  of stirrup, girth, or crupper, would have involved the safety of one's  neck. Nor did the very common sight of wooden crosses along the path,  indicating sudden death by accident or crime, tend to lessen the sense of  insecurity. The frequent casualties among these precipitous paths,  together with the healthfulness of the climate, have made it a proverb,  that it is a natural death, at St. Antonio, to be dashed to pieces on the  rocks. But such was not our fate. We at length reached the sea-shore, and  rode for a mile along the beach to the city of Poverson, before entering  which metropolis, it was necessary to cross a space of level, sandy  ground, about two hundred yards in extent. Here the little pilot suddenly  stuck his heels into the sides of his donkey, and dashed onward at a  killing pace; while mule and horse followed hard upon his track, to the  great admiration of ragamuffins, who had assembled to witness the entree  of the distinguished party.    Poverson is the capital of the island, and contains about two thousand  inhabitants, who, with few exceptions, are people of color. The streets  are crooked and narrow, and the houses mean. We called upon the military  and civil Governors, and, after accepting an invitation to dine with the  former, left the place for a further expedition. Passing over a shallow  river, in which a number of women and girls were washing clothes, we  ascended a hill so steep as to oblige us to dismount, and from the summit  of which we had a fine view of the rich valley beneath. It is by far the  most extensive tract of cultivated land that we have seen in the island,  and is improved to its utmost capacity. We thence rode three miles over a  path of the same description as before, and arrived at the village and  port of Point-de-Sol. The land about this little town is utterly barren,  and the inhabitants are dependent on Poverson for food, with the exception  of fish. A custom-house, a single store, a church, and some twenty houses  of fishermen, comprise all the notable characteristics of the principal  seaport of the island.    It was a part of our duty to make an examination of the harbor, for which  purpose we needed a boat. Two were hauled up on the beach; but the  smallest would have required the power of a dozen men to launch  her;--whereas, the fishermen being absent in their vocation, our party of  three, and a big boy at the store, comprised our whole available masculine  strength. The aid of woman, however, is seldom sought in vain; nor did it  fail us now. Old and young, matron and maid, they all sallied forth to  lend a hand, and, with such laughing and screaming as is apt to attend  feminine efforts, enabled us to launch the boat. In spite of their patois  of bad Portuguese, we contrived to establish a mutual understanding. A  fine, tall girl, with a complexion of deep olive, clear, large eyes, and  teeth beautifully white and even, stood by my side; and, like the Ancient  Mariner and his sister's son, we pulled together. She was strong, and, as  Byron says, \"lovely in her strength.\" This difficulty surmounted, we rowed  round the harbor, made our examination, and returned to the beach, where  we again received the voluntary assistance of the women, in dragging the  boat beyond the reach of the waves. We now adjourned to the store, in  order to requite their kindness by a pecuniary offering. Each of our fair  friends received two large copper coins, together equal to nine cents, and  were perfectly satisfied, as well they might be--for it was the price of a  day's work. Two or three individuals, moreover, \"turned double corners,\"  and were paid twice; and it is my private belief that the tall beauty  received her two coppers three times over.    After a lunch of fried plantains and eggs, we rode back to Poverson. On  the way, we met several persons of both sexes with burdens on their heads,  and noticed that our guide frequently accosted them with a request for a  pinch of snuff. With few exceptions, a horn or piece of bone was produced,  containing a fine yellow snuff of home-manufacture, which, instead of  being taken between the thumb and finger, was poured into the palm of the  hand, and thence conveyed to the nose. Arriving at the city, we proceeded  at once to the house of the Commandant, and in a little time were seated  at dinner.    Our host was fitted by nature to adorn a far more brilliant position than  that which he occupied, as the petty commander of a few colored soldiers,  in a little island of the torrid zone. He was slightly made, but perfectly  proportioned, with a face of rare beauty, and an expression at once noble  and pleasing. His eyes were large, and full of a dark light; his black  hair and moustache were trimmed with a care that showed him not insensible  of his personal advantages; as did likewise his braided jacket, fitting so  closely as to set off his fine figure to the best effect. His manners were  in a high degree polished and graceful. One of the guests, whom he had  invited to meet us, understood English; and the conversation was sustained  in that language, and in Spanish. The dinner was cooked and served in the  Portuguese style; it went off very pleasantly, and was quite as good as  could be expected at the house of a bachelor, in a place so seldom visited  by strangers. Each of the Portuguese gentlemen gave a sentiment, prefaced  by a short complimentary speech; and our party, of course, reciprocated in  little speeches of the same nature. The Commandant did not fail to express  the gratitude due from the people of the Cape de Verd islands to America,  for assistance in the hour of need. Time did not permit us to remain long  at table, and we took leave, highly delighted with our entertainment.    Mounting again, we rode out of town more quietly than we had entered it. A  sergeant was drilling some twenty negro soldiers in marching and wheeling.  His orders were given in a quick, loud tone, and enforced by the  occasional application of smart blows of a rattan to the shoulders of his  men. Suspecting that the blows fell thicker because we were witnesses of  his discipline, it seemed a point of humanity to hasten forward;  especially as the approach of night threatened to make our journey still  more perilous than before. After riding about three miles, we met two  well-dressed mulatto women on donkeys, accompanied by their cavaliers. Of  course, we allowed the ladies to pass between us and the rock; a matter of  no slight courtesy in such a position, where there was a very  uncomfortable hazard of being jostled headlong down the precipice. We  escaped, however, and spurring onward through the gloom of night, passed  unconsciously over several rough spots where we had dismounted in the  morning. The last mile of our mountain-ride was lighted by the moon; and,  as we descended the last hill, the guide gave a shrill whistle, to which  the boat's crew responded with three cheers for our return.    A good night's rest relieved us of our fatigue. The following morning,  with a fair breeze and a six hours' sail, we reached our floating-home,  and have ever since entertained the mess-table with the \"yarn\" of our  adventures; until now the subject is beginning to be worn thread-bare.  But, as the interior of the island of St. Antonio is one of the few  regions of the earth as yet uncelebrated by voyagers and tourists, I  cannot find in my heart to spare the reader a single sentence of the  foregoing narrative.

At 8 o'clock A.M.,  made the frigate Macedonian. She saluted the broad pennant, and both ships  bore up for Porto Grande, where we anchored, and read the news from home.    11.--The Commodore left the ship, and hoisted his broad pennant on board  the Macedonian.    16.--Sailed at 6 o'clock P.M., for Porto Praya.    17.--Anchored at Porto Praya, where we find the Decatur, which arrived  yesterday, after a passage of forty-five days from Norfolk.    22.--Sailed in the evening for the coast.    _October_ 7.--Off Cape Mount.    8.--Ashore at Monrovia. It being Sunday, we attended the Methodist Church.  Mr. Teage, editor of the Liberia Herald, preached an appropriate and  well-written discourse, on occasion of admitting three men and a woman to  church-membership. One of the males was a white, who had married a colored  woman in America, and came out to the colony with Mr. McDonough's people,  some time ago. His wife being dead, he has married another woman of color,  and is determined to live and die here.    10.--Dined with the Governor. Visited the house of a poor colonist, a  woman with two children and no husband. She endeavors to support her  family by washing. Two or three, other women of the neighborhood dropped  in. It is said that the proportion of female emigrants to males is as  three and a half to one. Unless it be expected that these women are to  work in the fields, it is difficult to imagine how they are to earn a  subsistence. A little chance washing and sewing, not enough to employ one  in ten, is all they have to depend upon. The consequence is, that every  person, of even moderate means of living, has two or three women to feed  and clothe. They do not need"]]]
