While yet seated at the table, Caesar entered, and  laying a small parcel in silence by the side of his master, modestly  retired behind his chair, where, placing one hand on its back, he  continued in an attitude half familiar, half respectful, a listener.    \"What is this, Caesar?\" inquired Mr. Wharton, turning the bundle over to  examine its envelope, and eying it rather suspiciously.    \"The 'baccy, sir; Harvey Birch, he got home, and he bring you a little  good 'baccy from York.\"    \"Harvey Birch!\" rejoined the master with great deliberation, stealing a  look at his guest. \"I do not remember desiring him to purchase any  tobacco for me; but as he has brought it, he must be paid for  his trouble.\"    For an instant only, as the negro spoke, did Harper suspend his silent  meal; his eye moved slowly from the servant to the master, and again all  remained in impenetrable reserve.    To Sarah Wharton, this intelligence gave unexpected pleasure; rising  from her seat with impatience, she bade the black show Birch into the  apartment; when, suddenly recollecting herself, she turned to the  traveler with an apologizing look, and added, \"If Mr. Harper will excuse  the presence of a peddler.\"    The indulgent benevolence expressed in the countenance of the stranger,  as he bowed a silent acquiescence, spoke more eloquently than the nicest  framed period, and the young lady repeated her order, with a confidence  in its truth that removed all embarrassment.    In the deep recesses of the windows of the cottage were seats of paneled  work; and the rich damask curtains, that had ornamented the parlor in  Queen Street, [Footnote: The Americans changed the names of many towns  and streets at the Revolution, as has since been done in France. Thus,  in the city of New York, Crown Street has become Liberty Street; King  Street, Pine Street; and Queen Street, then one of the most fashionable  quarters of the town, Pearl Street. Pearl Street is now chiefly occupied  by the auction dealers, and the wholesale drygoods merchants, for  warehouses and counting-rooms.] had been transferred to the Locusts, and  gave to the room that indescribable air of comfort, which so gratefully  announces the approach of a domestic winter. Into one of these recesses  Captain Wharton now threw himself, drawing the curtain before him in  such a manner as to conceal most of his person from observation; while  his younger sister, losing her natural frankness of manner, in an air of  artificial constraint, silently took possession of the other.    Harvey Birch had been a peddler from his youth; at least so he  frequently asserted, and his skill in the occupation went far to prove  the truth of the declaration. He was a native of one of the eastern  colonies; and, from something of superior intelligence which belonged to  his father, it was thought they had known better fortune in the land of  their nativity. Harvey possessed, however, the common manners of the  country, and was in no way distinguished from men of his class, but by  his acuteness, and the mystery which enveloped his movements. Ten years  before, they had arrived together in the vale, and, purchasing the  humble dwelling at which Harper had made his unsuccessful application,  continued ever since peaceful inhabitants, but little noticed and but  little known. Until age and infirmities had prevented, the father  devoted himself to the cultivation of the small spot of ground  belonging to his purchase, while the son pursued with avidity his humble  barter. Their orderly quietude had soon given them so much consideration  in the neighborhood, as to induce a maiden of five-and-thirty to forget  the punctilio of her sex, and to accept the office of presiding over  their domestic comforts. The roses had long before vanished from the  cheeks of Katy Haynes, and she had seen in succession, both her male and  female acquaintances forming the union so desirable to her sex, with but  little or no hope left for herself, when, with views of her own, she  entered the family of the Birches. Necessity is a hard master, and, for  the want of a better companion, the father and son were induced to  accept her services; but still Katy was not wanting in some qualities  which made her a very tolerable housekeeper. On the one hand, she was  neat, industrious, honest, and a good manager. On the other, she was  talkative, selfish, superstitious, and inquisitive. By dint of using the  latter quality with consummate industry, she had not lived in the family  five years when she triumphantly declared that she had heard, or rather  overheard, sufficient to enable her to say what had been the former fate  of her associates. Could Katy have possessed enough of divination to  pronounce upon their future lot, her task would have been accomplished.  From the private conversations of the parent and child, she learned that  a fire had reduced them from competence to poverty, and at the same time  diminished the number of their family to two. There was a tremulousness  in the voice of the father, as he touched lightly on the event, which  affected even the heart of Katy; but no barrier is sufficient to repel  vulgar curiosity. She persevered, until a very direct intimation from  Harvey, by threatening to supply her place with a female a few years  younger than herself, gave her awful warning that there were bounds  beyond which she was not to pass. From that period the curiosity of the  housekeeper had been held in such salutary restraint, that, although no  opportunity of listening was ever neglected, she had been able to add  but little to her stock of knowledge. There was, however, one piece of  intelligence, and that of no little interest to herself, which she had  succeeded in obtaining; and from the moment of its acquisition, she  directed her energies to the accomplishment of one object, aided by the  double stimulus of love and avarice.    Harvey was in the frequent habit of paying mysterious visits in the  depth of the night, to the fireplace of the apartment that served for  both kitchen and parlor. Here he was observed by Katy; and availing  herself of his absence and the occupations of the father, by removing  one of the hearthstones, she discovered an iron pot, glittering with a  metal that seldom fails to soften the hardest heart. Katy succeeded in  replacing the stone without discovery, and never dared to trust herself  with another visit. From that moment, however, the heart of the virgin  lost its obduracy, and nothing interposed between Harvey and his  happiness, but his own want of observation.    The war did not interfere with the traffic of the peddler, who seized on  the golden opportunity which the interruption of the regular trade  afforded, and appeared absorbed in the one grand object of amassing  money. For a year or two his employment was uninterrupted, and his  success proportionate; but, at length, dark and threatening hints began  to throw suspicion around his movements, and the civil authority thought  it incumbent on them to examine narrowly into his mode of life. His  imprisonments, though frequent, were not long; and his escapes from the  guardians of the law easy, compared to what he endured from the  persecution of the military. Still Birch survived, and still he  continued his trade, though compelled to be very guarded in his  movements, especially whenever he approached the northern boundaries of  the county; or in other words, the neighborhood of the American lines.  His visits to the Locusts had become less frequent, and his appearance  at his own abode so seldom, as to draw forth from the disappointed Katy,  in the fullness of her heart, the complaint we have related, in her  reply to Harper. Nothing, however, seemed to interfere with the pursuits  of this indefatigable trader, who, with a view to dispose of certain  articles for which he could only find purchasers in the very wealthiest  families of the county, had now braved the fury of the tempest, and  ventured to cross the half mile between his own residence and the house  of Mr. Wharton.    In a few minutes after receiving the commands of his young mistress,  Caesar reappeared, ushering into the apartment the subject of the  foregoing digression. In person, the peddler was a man above the middle  height, spare, but full of bone and muscle. At first sight, his strength  seemed unequal to manage the unwieldy burden of his pack; yet he threw  it on and off with great dexterity, and with as much apparent ease as if  it had been filled with feathers. His eyes were gray, sunken, restless,  and, for the flitting moments that they dwelt on the countenance of  those with whom he conversed, they seemed to read the very soul. They  possessed, however, two distinct expressions, which, in a great measure,  characterized the whole man. When engaged in traffic, the intelligence  of his face appeared lively, active, and flexible, though uncommonly  acute; if the conversation turned on the ordinary transactions of life,  his air became abstracted and restless; but if, by chance, the  Revolution and the country were the topic, his whole system seemed  altered--all his faculties were concentrated: he would listen for a  great length of time, without speaking, and then would break silence by  some light and jocular remark, that was too much at variance with his  former manner, not to be affectation. But of the war, and of his father,  he seldom spoke and always from some very obvious necessity.    To a superficial observer, avarice would seem his ruling passion--and,  all things considered, he was as unfit a subject for the plans of Katy  Haynes as can be readily imagined.

She left her own warm home.        When stone, and herb, and tree,      And all beneath heaven's lurid dome        By wintry majesty,      In his stern age, were clad with snow,      And human hearts beat chill and slow.        It was a fearful hour        For one so young and fair:      The woods had not one sheltering bower,        The earth was trackless there,      The very boughs in silver slept,      As the sea-foam had o'er them swept.        Snow after snow came down,        The sky look'd fix'd in ice;      She deem'd amid the season's power,        Her love would all suffice      To keep the source of being warm,      And mock the terrors of the storm.        Love was her world of life.        She thought but of her heart,      And knowing that the winter's strife        Could not its hope dispart,      She dream'd not that its home of clay      Might yield before the tempest's sway--        Or judged that passion's power--        Passion so strong and pure.      Might mock the snow-flake's wildering shower,        Proud that it could endure,      As woman oft in times before      Had peril borne as much or more.        She went--dawn past o'er dawn,        None saw her face again,      The eyes she should have gazed upon,        Look'd for her face in vain--      The ear to which her voice was song,      Her voice had sought--how vainly long!        There is in Saco's vale        A gently swelling hill,      Shadows have wrapt it like a veil        From trees that mark it still,      Around, the mountains towering blue      Look on that spot of saddest hue.        'Twas by that little hill,        At the dark noon of night,      Close by a frozen snow-hid rill,        Where branches close unite      Even in winter's leafless time,      The skeletons of summer's prime.        That flash'd the traveller's flame        On tree and precipice,      And show'd a fair unearthly frame        In robes of glittering ice,      With head against a trunk inclined,      Like a dream-spirit of the mind.        'Twas that love-wander'd maid, death-pale,        Her very heart's blood froze,      Love's Niobe, in her own vale,        Now reckless of all woes--      Love's victim fair, and true, find meet,      As she of the famed Paraclete.

[7] A few miles below the Notch of the White Mountains in the      Valley of Saco, is a little rise of land called \"Nancy's Hill.\"      It was formerly thickly covered with trees, a cluster of which      remains to mark the spot. In 1773, at Dartmouth, Jefferson co.      U.S. lived Nancy----, of respectable connexions. She was      engaged to be married. Her lover had set out for Lancaster. She      would follow him in the depth of winter, and on foot. There was      not a house for thirty miles, and the way through the wild      woods a footpath only. She persisted in her design, and      wrapping herself in her long cloak, proceeded on her way. Snow      and frost took place for several weeks, when some persons      passing her route, reached the lull at night. On lighting their      fires, an unearthly figure stood before them beneath the      bending branches, wrapped in a robe of ice. It was the lifeless      form of Nancy.           *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER        \"I am but a _Gatherer_ and disposer of other men's      stuff.\"--_Wotton_.           *       *       *       *       *    The late Dr. Barclay was a wit and a scholar, as well as a very great  physiologist. When a happy illustration, or even a point of pretty broad  humour, occurred to his mind, he hesitated not to apply it to the  subject in hand; and in this way, he frequently roused and rivetted  attention, when more abstract reasoning might have failed of its aim. On  one occasion he happened to dine with a large party, composed chiefly of  medical men. As the wine cup circulated, the conversation accidentally  took a professional turn, and from the excitation of the moment, or some  other cause, two of the youngest individuals present were the most  forward in delivering their opinions. Sir James McIntosh once told a  political opponent, that so far from following his example of using hard  words and soft arguments, he would pass, if possible, into the opposite  extreme, and use soft words and hard arguments. But our unfledged M.D.'s  disregarded the above salutary maxim, and made up in loudness what they  wanted in learning. At length, one of them said something so  emphatic--we mean as to manner--that a pointer dog started from his lair  beneath the table and _bow-wow-wowed_ so fiercely, that he fairly took  the lead in the discussion. Dr. Barclay eyed the hairy dialectician, and  thinking it high time to close the debate, gave the animal a hearty push  with his foot, and exclaimed in broad Scotch--\"Lie still, ye brute; for  I am sure ye ken just as little about it as ony o'them.\" We need hardly  add, that this sally was followed by a hearty burst of laughter, in  which even the disputants good-humouredly joined.           *       *       *       *       *          Fair woman was made to bewitch--      A pleasure, a pain, a disturber, a nurse,      A slave, or a tyrant, a blessing, or curse;        Fair woman was made to be--which?           *       *       *       *       *        _Printed and Published by J.
