The One Human Thing, with the Goblins before me--      Alone--in a loneness so ghastly--ALONE!    Fathom-deep from man's eye in the speechless profound,    With the death of the Main and the Monsters around.      \"Methought, as I gazed through the darkness, that now      IT[8] saw--the dread hundred-limbed creature-its prey!    And darted--O God! from the far flaming-bough      Of the coral, I swept on the horrible way;    And it seized me, the wave with its wrath and its roar,    It seized me to save--King, the danger is o'er!\"      On the youth gazed the monarch, and marvel'd; quoth he,      \"Bold Diver, the goblet I promised is thine,    And this ring will I give, a fresh guerdon to thee,      Never jewels more precious shone up from the mine,    If thou'lt bring me fresh tidings, and venture again    To tell what lies hid in the _innermost_ main?\"      Then outspake the daughter in tender emotion      \"Ah! father, my father, what more can there rest?    Enough of this sport with the pitiless ocean--      He has served thee as none would, thyself has confest.    If nothing can slake thy wild thirst of desire,    Let thy knights put to shame the exploit of the squire!\"      The king seized the goblet--he swung it on high,      And whirling, it fell in the roar of the tide:    \"But bring back that goblet again to my eye,      And I'll hold thee the dearest that rides by my side;    And thine arms shall embrace, as thy bride, I decree,    The maiden whose pity now pleadeth for thee.\"      In his heart, as he listen'd, there leapt the wild joy--      And the hope and the love through his eyes spoke in fire,    On that bloom, on that blush, gazed delighted the boy;      The maiden-she faints at the feet of her sire!    Here the guerdon divine, there the danger beneath;    He resolves! To the strife with the life and the death!      They hear the loud surges sweep back in their swell,      Their coming the thunder-sound heralds along!    Fond eyes yet are tracking the spot where he fell:      They come, the wild waters, in tumult and throng,    Roaring up to the cliff--roaring back, as before,    But no wave ever brings the lost youth to the shore.           *       *       *       *        THE CRANES OF IBYCUS (1797)        From Rhegium to the Isthmus, long    Hallow'd to steeds and glorious song,    Where, link'd awhile in holy peace,    Meet all the sons of martial Greece--    Wends Ibycus-whose lips the sweet      And ever-young Apollo fires;    The staff supports the wanderer's feet--    The God the Poet's soul inspires!      Soon from the mountain-ridges high,    The tower-crown'd Corinth greets his eye;    In Neptune's groves of darksome pine,    He treads with shuddering awe divine;    Nought lives around him, save a swarm      Of CRANES, that still pursued his way.    Lured by the South, they wheel and form    In ominous groups their wild array.      And \"Hail! beloved Birds!\" he cried;    \"My comrades on the ocean tide,    Sure signs of good ye bode to me;    Our lots alike would seem to be;    From far, together borne, we greet      A shelter now from toil and danger;    And may the friendly hearts we meet    Preserve from every ill--the Stranger!\"      His step more light, his heart more gay,    Along the mid-wood winds his way,    When, where the path the thickets close,    Burst sudden forth two ruffian foes;    Now strife to strife, and foot to foot!      Ah! weary sinks the gentle hand;    The gentle hand that wakes the lute      Has learn'd no lore that guides the brand.      He calls on men and Gods--in vain!    His cries no blest deliverer gain;    Feebler and fainter grows the sound,    And still the deaf life slumbers round--    \"In the far land I fall forsaken,      Unwept and unregarded, here;    By death from caitiff hands o'ertaken,      Nor ev'n one late avenger near!\"      Down to the earth the death-stroke bore him--    Hark, where the Cranes wheel dismal o'er him!    He hears, as darkness veils his eyes,    Near, in hoarse croak, their dirge-like cries.    \"Ye whose wild wings above me hover,      (Since never voice, save yours alone,    The deed can tell)--the hand discover--      Avenge!\"--He spoke, and life was gone.      Naked and maim'd the corpse was found--    And, still through many a mangling wound,    The sad Corinthian Host could trace    The loved--too well-remember'd face.    \"And must I meet thee thus once more?      Who hoped with wreaths of holy pine,    Bright with new fame--the victory o'er--      The Singer's temples to entwine!\"      And loud lamented every guest    Who held the Sea-God's solemn feast--    As in a single heart prevailing,    Throughout all Hellas went the wailing.    Wild to the Council Hall they ran--      In thunder rush'd the threat'ning Flood--    \"Revenge shall right the murder'd man,      The last atonement-blood for blood!\"      Yet 'mid the throng the Isthmus claims,    Lured by the Sea-God's glorious games--    The mighty many-nation'd throng--    How track the hand that wrought the wrong?--    How guess if that dread deed were done,      By ruffian hands, or secret foes?    He who sees all on earth--the SUN--      Alone the gloomy secret knows.      Perchance he treads in careless peace,    Amidst your Sons, assembled Greece;    Hears with a smile revenge decreed;    Gloats with fell joy upon the deed.    His steps the avenging gods may mock      Within the very Temple's wall,    Or mingle with the crowds that flock      To yonder solemn scenic[9] hall.      Wedg'd close, and serried, swarms the crowd--    Beneath the weight the walls are bow'd--    Thitherwards streaming far, and wide,    Broad Hellas flows in mingled tide tide--    A tide like that which heaves the deep      When hollow-sounding, shoreward driven;    On, wave on wave, the thousands sweep      Till arching, row on row, to heaven!      The tribes, the nations, who shall name,    That guest-like, there assembled came?    From Theseus' town, from Aulis' strand--    From Phocis, from the Spartans' land--    From Asia's wave-divided clime,      The Isles that gem the AEgean Sea,    To hearken on that Stage Sublime,      The Dark Choir's mournful melody!      True to the awful rites of old,    In long and measured strides, behold    The Chorus from the hinder ground,    Pace the vast circle's solemn round.    So this World's women never strode--      Their race from Mortals ne'er began;    Gigantic, from their grim abode,      They tower above the Sons of Man!      Across their loins the dark robe clinging,    In fleshless hands the torches swinging,    Now to and fro, with dark red glow--    No blood that lives the dead cheeks know!    Where flow the locks that woo to love      On _human_ temples--ghastly dwell    The serpents, coil'd the brow above,      And the green asps with poison swell.      Thus circling, horrible, within    That space--doth their dark hymn begin,    And round the sinner as they go,    Cleave to the heart their words of woe.    Dismally wails, the senses chilling,      The hymn--the FURIES' solemn song;    And froze the very marrow thrilling      As roll'd the gloomy sounds along.      And weal to him--from crime secure--    Who keeps his soul as childhood's pure;    Life's path he roves, a wanderer free--    We near him not-THE AVENGERS, WE,    But woe to him for whom we weave      The doom for deeds that shun the light:    Fast to the murderer's feet we cleave,      The fearful Daughters of the Night.      \"And deems he flight from us can hide him?    Still on dark wings We sail beside him!    The murderer's feet the snare enthralls--    Or soon or late, to earth he falls!    Untiring, hounding on, we go;      For blood can no remorse atone I    On, ever--to the Shades below,      And there--we grasp him, still our own!\"      So singing, their slow dance they wreathe,    And stillness, like a silent death,    Heavily there lay cold and drear,    As if the Godhead's self were near.    Then, true to those strange rites of old,      Pacing the circle's solemn round,    In long and measured strides--behold,      They vanish in the hinder ground!      Confused and doubtful--half between    The solemn truth and phantom scene,    The crowd revere the Power, presiding    O'er secret deeps, to justice guiding--    The Unfathom'd and Inscrutable      By whom the web of doom is spun,    Whose shadows in the deep heart dwell,      Whose form is seen not in the sun!      Just then, amidst the highest tier,     Breaks forth a voice that starts the ear;    \"See there--see there, Timotheus,     Behold the Cranes of Ibycus!\"     A sudden darkness wraps the sky;       Above the roofless building hover     Dusk, swarming wings; and heavily       Sweep the slow Cranes, hoarse-murmuring, over!      \"Of Ibycus?\"--that name so dear     Thrills through the hearts of those who hear!     Like wave on wave in eager seas,     From mouth to mouth the murmur flees--    \"Of Ibycus, whom we bewail!       The murder'd one! What mean those words?     Who is the man--knows _he_ the tale?       Why link that name with those wild birds?\"       Questions on questions louder press--     Like lightning flies the inspiring guess--     Leaps every heart--\"The truth we seize;     Your might is here, EUMENIDES!     The murderer yields himself confest--       Vengeance is near--that voice the token--     Ho!-him who yonder spoke, arrest!       And him to whom the words were spoken!\"       Scarce had the wretch the words let fall,     Than fain their sense he would recall     In vain;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#9)"],[1,"which was solved first. In 1856 the  Porte had promised religious reforms tending to the appointment of  Bulgarian bishops and the recognition of the Bulgarian language in Church  and school. But these not being carried through, the Bulgarians took the  matter into their own hands, and in 1860 refused any longer to recognize  the Patriarch of Constantinople. The same year an attempt was made to  bring the Church of Bulgaria under that of Rome, but, owing to Russian  opposition, proved abortive. In 1870, the growing agitation having at last  alarmed the Turks, the Bulgarian Exarchate was established. The Bulgarian  Church was made free and national and was to be under an Exarch who should  reside at Constantinople (Bulgaria being still a Turkish province). The  Greeks, conscious what a blow this would be to their supremacy, managed  for a short while to stave off the evil day, but in 1872 the Exarch was  triumphantly installed in Constantinople, where he resided till 1908.    Meanwhile revolutionary outbreaks began to increase, but were always put  down with great rigour. The most notable was that of 1875, instigated by  Stambulov, the future dictator, in sympathy with the outbreak in  Montenegro, Hercegovina, and Bosnia of that year; the result of this and  of similar movements in 1876 was the series of notorious Bulgarian  massacres in that year. The indignation of Europe was aroused and  concerted representations were urgently made at Constantinople. Midhat  Pasha disarmed his opponents by summarily introducing the British  constitution into Turkey, but, needless to say, Bulgaria's lot was not  improved by this specious device. Russia had, however, steadily been  making her preparations, and, Turkey having refused to discontinue  hostilities against Montenegro, on April 24, 1877, war was declared by the  Emperor Alexander II, whose patience had become exhausted; he was joined  by Prince Charles of Rumania, who saw that by doing so he would be  rewarded by the complete emancipation of his country, then still a  vassal-state of Turkey, and its erection into a kingdom. At the beginning  of the war all went well for the Russians and Rumanians, who were soon  joined by large numbers of Bulgarian insurgents; the Turkish forces were  scattered all over the peninsula. The committee of Bucarest transformed  itself into a provisional government, but the Russians, who had undertaken  to liberate the country, naturally had to keep its administration  temporarily in their own hands, and refused their recognition. The Turks,  alarmed at the early victories of the Russians, brought up better generals  and troops, and defeated the Russians at Plevna in July. They failed,  however, to dislodge them from the important and famous Shipka Pass in  August, and after this they became demoralized and their resistance  rapidly weakened. The Russians, helped by the Bulgarians and Rumanians,  fought throughout the summer with the greatest gallantry; they took  Plevna, after a three months' siege, in December, occupied Sofia and  Philippopolis in January 1878, and pushed forward to the walls of  Constantinople.    The Turks were at their last gasp, and at Adrianople, in March 1878,  Ignatiyev dictated the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano, by which a  principality of Bulgaria, under the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan, was  created, stretching from the Danube to the Aegean, and from the Black Sea  to Albania, including all Macedonia and leaving to the Turks only the  district between Constantinople and Adrianople, Chalcidice, and the town  of Salonika; Bulgaria would thus have regained the dimensions it possessed  under Tsar Simeon nine hundred and fifty years previously.    This treaty, which on ethnological grounds was tolerably just, alarmed the  other powers, especially Great Britain and Germany, who thought they  perceived in it the foundations of Russian hegemony in the Balkans, while  it would, if put into execution, have blighted the aspirations of Greece  and Serbia. The Treaty of Berlin, inspired by Bismarck and Lord Salisbury,  anxious to defend, the former, the interests of (ostensibly)  Austria-Hungary, the latter (shortsightedly) those of Turkey, replaced it  in July 1878. By its terms Bulgaria was cut into three parts; northern  Bulgaria, between the Danube and the Balkans, was made an autonomous  province, tributary to Turkey; southern Bulgaria, fancifully termed  Eastern Rumelia (Rumili was the name always given by the Turks to the  whole Balkan peninsula), was to have autonomous administration under a  Christian governor appointed by the Porte; Macedonia was left to Turkey;  and the Dobrudja, between the Danube and the Black Sea, was adjudged to  Rumania.        11    _The Aftermath, and Prince Alexander of Battenberg, 1878-86_      The relations between the Russians and the Bulgarians were better before  the liberation of the latter by the former than after; this may seem  unjust, because Bulgaria could never have freed herself so decisively and  rapidly alone, and Russia was the only power in whose interest it was to  free her from the Turks, and who could translate that interest so promptly  into action; nevertheless, the laws controlling the relationships of  states and nationalities being much the same as those which control the  relationships of individuals, it was only to be expected.    What so often happens in the relationships of individuals happened in  those between Russia and Bulgaria. Russia naturally enough expected  Bulgaria to be grateful for the really large amount of blood and treasure  which its liberation had cost Russia, and, moreover, expected its  gratitude to take the form of docility and a general acquiescence in all  the suggestions and wishes expressed by its liberator. Bulgaria was no  doubt deeply grateful, but never had the slightest intention of expressing  its gratitude in the desired way; on the contrary, like most people who  have regained a long-lost and unaccustomed freedom of action or been put  under an obligation, it appeared touchy and jealous of its right to an  independent judgement. It is often assumed by Russophobe writers that  Russia wished and intended to make a Russian province of Bulgaria, but  this is very unlikely; the geographical configuration of the Balkan  peninsula would not lend itself to its incorporation in the Russian  Empire, the existence between the two of the compact and vigorous national  block of Rumania, a Latin race and then already an independent state, was  an insurmountable obstacle, and, finally, it is quite possible for Russia  to obtain possession or control of Constantinople without owning all the  intervening littoral.    That Russia should wish to have a controlling voice in the destinies of  Bulgaria and in those of the whole peninsula was natural, and it was just  as natural that Bulgaria should resent its pretensions. The eventual  result of this, however, was that Bulgaria inevitably entered the sphere  of Austrian and ultimately of German influence or rather calculation, a  contingency probably not foreseen by its statesmen at the time, and whose  full meaning, even if it had, would not have been grasped by them.    The Bulgarians, whatever the origin and the ingredients of their  nationality, are by language a purely Slavonic people; their ancestors  were the pioneers of Slavonic civilization as expressed in its monuments  of theological literature. Nevertheless, they have never been enthusiastic  Pan-Slavists, any more than the Dutch have ever been ardent Pan-Germans;  it is as unreasonable to expect such a thing of the one people as it is of  the other. The Bulgarians indeed think themselves superior to the Slavs by  reason of the warlike and glorious traditions of the Tartar tribe that  gave them their name and infused the Asiatic element into their race, thus  endowing them with greater stability, energy, and consistency than is  possessed by purely Slav peoples. These latter, on the other hand, and  notably the Serbians, for the same reason affect contempt for the mixture  of blood and for what they consider the Mongol characteristics of the  Bulgarians. What is certain is that between Bulgarians and Germans  (including German Austrians and Magyars) there has never existed that  elemental, ineradicable, and insurmountable antipathy which exists between  German (and Magyar) and Slav wherever the two races are contiguous, from  the Baltic to the Adriatic; nothing is more remarkable than the way in  which the Bulgarian people has been flattered, studied, and courted in  Austria-Hungary and Germany, during the last decade, to the detriment of  the purely Slav Serb race with whom it is always compared. The reason is  that with the growth of the Serb national movement, from 1903 onwards,  Austria-Hungary and Germany felt an instinctive and perfectly  well-justified fear of the Serb race, and sought to neutralize the  possible effect of its growing power by any possible means.    It is not too much to say, in summing up, that Russian influence, which  had been growing stronger in Bulgaria up till 1877-8, has since been  steadily on the decline; Germany and Austria-Hungary, who reduced Bulgaria  to half the size that Count Ignatiyev had made it by the Treaty of San  Stefano, reaped the benefit, especially the commercial benefit, of the war  which Russia had waged. Intellectually, and especially as regards the  replenishment and renovation of the Bulgarian language, which, in spite of  numerous Turkish words introduced during the Ottoman rule, is essentially  Slavonic both in substance and form, Russian influence was especially  powerful, and has to a certain extent maintained itself. Economically,  owing partly to geographical conditions, both the Danube and the main  oriental railway linking Bulgaria directly with Budapest and Vienna,  partly to the fact that Bulgaria's best customers for its cereals are in  central and western"]]]
