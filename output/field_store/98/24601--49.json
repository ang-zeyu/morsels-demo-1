Then our forefathers thought that  fairies were gods. They built temples in their honor, and prayed to  them. Then, in the place where is now the little town of Ulrum in  Friesland was the home of the spirit in the ice, Uller. That is what  Ulrum means, the home of the good fairy Uller.    Uller was the patron of boys and girls. They liked him, because he  invented skates and sleds and sleighs. He had charge of things in winter  and enjoyed the cold. He delighted also in hunting. Dressed in thick  furs, he loved to roam over the hills and through the forests, seeking  out the wolf, the bear, the deer, and the aurochs. His bow and arrows  were terrible, for they were very big and he was a sure shot. Being the  patron of archery, hunters always sought his favor. The yew tree was  sacred to Uller, because the best bows were made from its wood. No one  could cut down a yew tree without angering Uller.    Nobody knew who Uller's father was, and if he knew himself, he did not  care to tell any one. He would not bestow many blessings upon mankind;  yet thousands of people used to come to Ulrum every year to invoke his  aid and ask him to send a heavy fall of snow to cover the ground. That  meant good crops of food for the next year. The white snow, lying thick  upon the ground, kept back the frost giants from biting the earth too  hard. Because of deep winter snows, the ground was soft during the next  summer. So the seed sprouted more easily and there was plenty to eat.    When Uller travelled over the winter snow, to go out on hunting trips,  he strapped snow-shoes on his feet. Because these were shaped like a  warrior's shield, Uller was often called the shield-god. His protection  was especially invoked by men who fought duels with sword or spear,  which were very common in early days; or by soldiers or hunters, who  wished to be very brave, or had engaged in perilous ventures.    Now when Uller wanted a wife to marry him, he made love to Skadi,  because she was a huntress and liked the things which he liked. So they  never had a quarrel. She was very strong, fond of sports, and of chasing  the wild animals. She wore a short skirt, which allowed freedom of  motion to her limbs. Then she ranged over the hills and valleys with  wonderful swiftness. So rapid were her movements that many people  likened her to the cold mountain stream, that leaps down from the high  peaks and over the rocks, foaming and dashing to the lowlands. They gave  the same name to both this fairy woman and the water, because they were  so much alike.    Indeed Skadi was very lovely to look at. It was no wonder that many of  the gods, fairies and men fell in love with her. It is even said that  she had had several husbands before marrying Uller. When you look at her  pictures, you will see that she was as pretty as bright winter itself,  when Jack Frost clothes the trees with white and makes the cheeks of the  girls so rosy. She wore armor of shining steel, a silver helmet, short  white skirts and white fur leggings. Her snow-shoes were of the hue of  winter. Besides a glittering spear, she had a bow and sharp arrows.  These were held in a silver quiver slung over her shoulders. Altogether,  she looked like winter alive. She loved to live in the mountains, and  hear the thunders of cataracts, the crash of avalanches, the moaning of  the winds in the pine forests. Even the howling of wolves was music in  her ears. She was afraid of nothing.    Now from such a father and mother one would expect wonderful children,  yet very much like their parents. It turned out that the offspring of  Uller and Skadi were all daughters. To them--one after another--were  given the names meaning Glacier, Cold, Snow, Drift, Snow Whirl, and Snow  Dust, the oldest being the biggest and hardiest. The others were in  degree softer and more easily influenced by the sun and the wind. They  all looked alike, so that some people called them the Six White Sisters.    Yet they were all so great and powerful that many considered them  giantesses. It was not possible for men to tame them, for they did very  much as they pleased. No one could stop their doings or drive them away,  except Woden, who was the god of the sun. Yet in winter, even he left  off ruling the world and went away. During that time, that is, during  seven months, Uller took Woden's throne and governed the affairs of the  world. When summer came, Uller went with his wife up to the North Pole;  or they lived in a house, on the top of the Alps. There they could hunt  and roam on their snow-shoes. To these cold places, which the whole  family enjoyed, their daughters went also and all were very happy so far  above the earth.    Things went on pleasantly in Uller's family so long as his daughters  were young, for then the girls found enough to delight in at their daily  play. But when grown up and their heads began to be filled with notions  about the young giants, who paid visits to them, then the family  troubles began.    [Illustration: YET ALL THE TIME HE WAS CALLING ON HUMAN BEINGS TO HARNESS  HIM TO WHEELS]    There was one young giant fairy named Vuur, who came often to see all  six of Uller's daughters, from the youngest to the oldest. Yet no one  could tell which of them he was in love with, or could name the girl he  liked best; no, not even the daughters themselves. His character and his  qualities were not well known, for he put on many disguises and appeared  in many places. It was believed, however, that he had already done a  good deal of mischief and was likely to do more, for he loved  destruction. Yet he often helped the kabouter dwarfs to do great things;  so that showed he was of some use. In fact he was the fire fairy. He  kept on, courting all the six sisters, long after May day came, and he  lengthened his visits until the heat turned the entire half dozen of  them into water. So they became one.    At this, Uller was so angry at Vuur's having delayed so long before  popping the question, and at his daughters' losing their shapes, that he  made Vuur marry them all and at once, they taking the name of Regen.    Now when the child of Vuur and Regen was born, it turned out to be, in  body and in character, just what people expected from such a father and  mother. It was named in Dutch, Stoom. It grew fast and soon showed that  it was as powerful as its parents had been; yet it was much worse, when  shut up, than when allowed to go free in the air. Stoom loved to do all  sorts of tricks. In the kitchen, it would make the iron kettle lid flop  up and down with a lively noise. If it were confined in a vessel,  whether of iron or earthenware, when set over the fire, it would blow  the pot or kettle all to pieces, in order to get out. Thinking itself a  great singer, it would make rather a pleasant sound, when its mother let  it come out of a spout. Yet it never obeyed either of its parents. When  they tried to shut up Stoom inside of anything, it always escaped with a  terrible sound. In fact, nothing could long hold it in, without an  explosion.    Sometimes Stoom would go down into the bowels of the earth and turn on a  stream of water so as to meet the deep fires which are ever burning far  down below us. Then there would come an awful earthquake, because Stoom  wanted to get out, and the earth crust would not let him, but tried to  hold him down. Sometimes Stoom slipped down into a volcano's mouth. Then  the mountain, in order to save itself from being choked, had to spit  Stoom out, and this always made a terrible mess on the ground, and men  called it lava. Or, Stoom might stay down in the crater as a guest, and  quietly come out, occasionally, in jets and puffs.    Even when Jack Frost was around and froze the pipes in the house, or  turned the water of the pots, pans, kettles and bottles into solid ice,  Stoom behaved very badly. If the frozen kettles, or any other closed  vessel were put over the stove, or near the fire, and the ice melted at  the bottom too fast, Stoom would blow the whole thing up. In this way,  he often put men's lives in danger and made them lose their property.    No one seemed to know how to handle this mischievous fairy. Not one man  on earth could do anything with him. So they let him have his own way.  Yet all the time, though he was enjoying his own tricks and lively fun,  he was, with his own voice, calling on human beings to use him properly,  and harness him to wheels; for he was willing to be useful to them, and  was all ready to pull or drive, lift or lower, grind or pump, as the  need might be.    As long as men did not treat him properly and give him the right to get  out into the air, after he had done his work, Stoom would explode, blow  up and destroy everything. He could be made to sing, hiss, squeal,  whistle, and make all kinds of sounds, but, unless the bands that held  him in were strong enough, or if Vuur got too hot, or his mother would  not give him drink enough, when the iron pipes were red with heat, he  would lose his temper and explode. He had no respect for bad or  neglected boilers, or for lazy or careless firemen and engineers.    Yet properly harnessed and treated well, and fed with the food such as  his mother can give, and roused by his father's persuasion, Stoom is  greater than any giant or fairy that ever was. He can drive a ship, a  locomotive, a submarine, or an aeroplane, as fast as Fro's boar, horse  or ship. Everybody to-day is glad that Stoom is such a good servant and  friend all over the world.          THE ELVES AND THEIR ANTICS      The elves are the little white creatures that live between heaven and  earth. They are not in the clouds, nor down in the caves and mines, like  the kabouters.

(#8)"],[1,"quite certain he would be pursued, he lost no time on  the road. The trail showed he was going at a full gallop, and, under the  most favorable circumstances, the chase was sure to be a long one.        CHAPTER IX       A Hot Pursuit--An Unexpected Calamity--Carson Continues the Chase   Alone--The Result.    Everything now depended on speed. Not only was the dusky thief pushing  his animals to the utmost, but Kit Carson knew he would give them little  rest night or day. He was familiar with the route to California and the  pursuit would be no child's play.    There could be no doubt, however, of the destination of the redskin, and  Carson and his brave warrior were equally persistent with their horses.  The ground flew beneath their hoofs. Across the stretch of prairie,  along the bank of the rushing streams, around the rocks, over mountains,  through torrents, they forced their way, with no thought of turning back  or checking the speed of their animals. Occasionally the bright eyes of  the pursuers glanced at the ground in front, when the displaced gravel  or the indentation in the soft earth showed they had not lost the trail.    In this headlong fashion the friends galloped forward until they had  placed a full hundred miles behind them. They were a long distance from  home and camp, but in spite of the speed of the fugitive, Carson was  confident they had gained considerably upon him. If everything went  well, they ought to catch sight of him on the morrow. At this juncture,  when the prospect was so encouraging, an unlooked for calamity occurred.    Carson's steed stood the great strain admirably, but the one bestrode  by the Indian succumbed. He suddenly slackened his pace, staggered and  trembled so violently, that, when the warrior leaped from his back, he  saw he was fearfully ill. If he did not die, he would not recover for  hours and even then could not be forced hard.    Carson contemplated the situation with dismay. He had not counted on  anything like this, and the help of the Indian was beyond all price  to him. He was unusually strong, active and experienced, and would not  hesitate to attack any person single handed.    Seeing the condition of the exhausted steed, Kit proposed to his dusky  companion that he should abandon him and continue the pursuit on foot,  but the brave shook his head. He was equal to the exploit of running ten  or twenty miles at a high pace, but a great deal more was likely to  be required and he needed all his powers when the shock of the battle  should come. He not only refused to continue the chase, but, knowing  the character of the thief, tried to dissuade Carson from going further.  They had certainly done all that could be asked of them and no one could  find fault if, in the face of such difficulty, they should withdraw and  return to their friends.    \"No,\" said Carson, \"I have set out to recover those horses and nothing  shall turn me back. I am sorry to lose you, but it can't be helped; so  good bye and good luck attend you.\"    And putting spurs to his steed, he dashed over the trail with compressed  lips and flashing eye, determined on running down the fugitive if he had  to follow him to the bank of the Pacific itself. This single act of the  famous mountaineer shows his character in its true light.    In the first place, it must be remembered that Kit Carson was a man  of slight figure and was never noted for his strength. Many of his  companions were much more powerful, though none was so quick and active  in his movements. His wonderful success lay in his coolness, agility,  skill and bravery, which never \"overleaped itself.\" As we have stated,  he was below the medium stature, and never could have attained a tithe  of his renown, had his muscular strength formed a necessary part of his  requirements.    On the other hand, the Indian thief whom he was pursuing, was  exceptionally powerful, athletic and one of the most desperate men on  the whole frontier. He cared nothing for Carson, nor for any single  member of the company he had left. He would expect pursuit and would be  on the watch for it. Whenever he caught sight of those who were seeking  him, he would not abandon the horses and flee. Far from it: he would  stand his ground, and if his booty should be wrested from him the men  who did it would be compelled to the fiercest kind of fight. He would  not run from the attack of two or three persons: much less from one of  the most insignificant men in the entire company.    The course of Carson illustrated another marked feature of his  character--that of loyalty to his friends and resolution in carrying  through any task he undertook. Where scarcely one man in a multitude  would have pushed forward, he advanced without hesitation. He  deliberately resolved to attack a fierce criminal who was as fully armed  as he, as daring and perfect in his knowledge of woodcraft, and much his  superior in strength.    Carson had proven the mettle of his steed, and he now showed him no  mercy. The trail indicated he was gaining rapidly and he was anxious to  force matters to an issue before night. Among the horses the Indian was  running off were one or two whose endurance was less than the others.  Their tardiness moderated the pace of the rest, and thus gave Kit a  chance of lessening the distance between him and the fugitive.    At the end of the ten miles he scanned the ground in front, but nothing  was seen of the thief or his horses; but the hoof prints were fresh and  the scout knew he was closer to him than at any time since the chase  began. The flanks of his steed shone with perspiration and froth, but  it would not do to lag now. The lips were compressed and the gray eye  flashed fire as before.    Ten more miles were speedily thrown behind him, and he knew he was not  far from the dusky desperado, who doubtless was continually glancing  backward in quest of pursuers; but the keen vision which swept around  every portion of the visible horizon, discovered no sign of the thief.    Carson anticipated some attempt on the part of the fugitive to confuse  pursuit and he, therefore, watched the hoof prints more closely than  ever. The eagle eye continually glanced from the ground to the country  in front, and then to the right and left. Nothing escaped his vision,  but when his foamy steed had thundered over another ten miles the  fugitive was still beyond sight.    \"He can't be far off,\" was the thought of Carson, \"I'm bound to overtake  him before long.\"    At that moment, he caught sight of the Indian galloping leisurely  forward, amid the stolen horses. The cunning savage, as the scout had  suspected, was constantly on the alert, and detected Carson the same  moment that he himself was discovered. Quick as a flash, he leaped from  the back of his horses and started on a swift run for a clump of trees  between him and his pursuer. The latter understood his purpose on the  instant. If the Indian could secure the shelter of the grove, he would  have his enemy at his mercy; for not only would he be able to protect  his body, while loading and firing, but Carson himself, being in an open  space, would be without the slightest protection against his deadly aim.    Carson cocked his rifle and driving his spurs into the flanks of his  high spirited steed, charged at full speed for the same shelter. Whoever  should reach it first would be the master.    The Indian had much less distance to run, and was as fleet of foot as  a deer. He bounded forward with such tremendous strides, that while the  horseman was still some distance away, he plunged in among the trees;  but for the last few seconds the foes had approached each other at a  terrific pace, a result that was not only inevitable, but desirable, to  the pursuer.    The very second the savage arrived on the margin of the grove, he made a  leap for the nearest tree from behind which he meant to shoot his enemy;  but in the very act of doing so, he was smitten by his bullet. Without  checking his animal in the slightest, Carson had aimed and fired.    The death screech of the savage rang out, as he leaped in the air and  tumbled prostrate to the earth, killed by the shot that was unerring in  its accuracy. The Indian himself was so near firing his gun, that his  piece was also discharged, the ball whizzing harmlessly above the head  of his pursuer. A couple of seconds delay on the part of Carson must  have proved fatal to him, for the savage was a good marksman, and was  standing still, with such a brief space intervening, that he could not  have missed. It is hard to conceive of any escape more narrow than that  of the daring mountaineer.        CHAPTER X.       Carson Returns with the Recovered Property--Journey to Snake   River--Starts on a Trapping Expedition with Three Companions--Carson's   Stirring Adventure with Two Grizzly Bears.    Carson gathered the horses together and set out on his return. The  distance was considerable and he was compelled to encamp more than once  on the road, while he was continually exposed to attack from Indians,  but with that remarkable skill and foresight which distinguished him  when a boy, he reached home without the slightest mishap and turned over  the recovered animals to their owner. Some days later, several trappers  entered camp with the statement that a large body of hunters were on  Snake River, a fortnight's journey distant. Captain Lee at once set out  with his men and found the company who gave them a warm welcome. They  purchased all the supplies Captain Lee had for sale, and then, as  Carson's engagement with the Captain was ended, he attached himself to  the other body. He remained, however, only a few weeks, for he saw there  were so many that they could never take enough peltries to bring  much money to the individual members. He decided to do as he had done  before--arrange an expedition of his own. He had but to make known  his intentions, when he"]]]
