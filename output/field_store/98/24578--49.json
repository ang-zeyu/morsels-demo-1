For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his  repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out:  \"they shall lay their hands on the sick\"--when outside there rang  clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled  thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: \"Camelot _Weekly  Hosannah and Literary Volcano!_--latest irruption--only two cents  --all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!\"  One greater  than kings had arrived--the newsboy.  But I was the only person  in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and  what this imperial magician was come into the world to do.    I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper; the  Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change;  is around the corner yet.  It was delicious to see a newspaper  again, yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon  the first batch of display head-lines.  I had lived in a clammy  atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they  sent a quivery little cold wave through me:                    HIGH TIMES IN THE VALLEY                        OF HOLINESS!                            ----                   THE WATER-WORKS CORKED!                            ----             BRER MERLIN WORKS HIS ARTS, BUT GETS                          LEFT?                            ----          But the Boss scores on his first Innings!                            ----              The Miraculous Well Uncorked amid                    awful outbursts of                  INFERNAL FIRE AND SMOKE                       ATHUNDER!                            ----               THE BUZZARD-ROOST ASTONISHED!                            ----                  UNPARALLELED REJOIBINGS!      --and so on, and so on.  Yes, it was too loud.  Once I could have  enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its  note was discordant.  It was good Arkansas journalism, but this  was not Arkansas.  Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated  to give offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising.  Indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through  the paper.  It was plain I had undergone a considerable change  without noticing it.  I found myself unpleasantly affected by  pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and  airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life.  There was an  abundance of the following breed of items, and they discomforted me:       LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS.       Sir Launcelot met up with old King     Agrivance of Ireland unexpectedly last     weok over on the moor south of Sir     Balmoral le Merveilleuse's hog dasture.     The widow has been notified.       Expedition No. 3 will start adout the     first of mext month on a search f8r Sir     Sagramour le Desirous. It is in com-     and of the renowned Knight of the Red     Lawns, assissted by Sir Persant of Inde,     who is compete9t. intelligent, courte-     ous, and in every way a brick, and fur-     tHer assisted by Sir Palamides the Sara-     cen, who is no huckleberry hinself.     This is no pic-nic, these boys mean     busine&s.       The readers of the Hosannah will re-     gret to learn that the hadndsome and     popular Sir Charolais of Gaul, who dur-     ing his four weeks' stay at the Bull and     Halibut, this city, has won every heart     by his polished manners and elegant     cPnversation, will pUll out to-day for     home. Give us another call, Charley!       The bdsiness end of the funeral of     the late Sir Dalliance the duke's son of     Cornwall, killed in an encounter with     the Giant of the Knotted Bludgeon last     Tuesday on the borders of the Plain of     Enchantment was in the hands of the     ever affable and efficient Mumble,     prince of un3ertakers, then whom there     exists none by whom it were a more     satisfying pleasure to have the last sad     offices performed. Give him a trial.       The cordial thanks of the Hosannah     office are due, from editor down to     devil, to the ever courteous and thought-     ful Lord High Stew d of the Palace's     Third Assistant V  t for several sau-     ceTs of ice crEam a quality calculated     to make the ey of the recipients hu-     mid with grt  ude; and it done it.     When this  administration wants to     chalk up a desirable name for early     promotion, the Hosannah would like a     chance to sudgest.       The Demoiselle Irene Dewlap, of     South Astolat, is visiting her uncle, the     popular host of the Cattlemen's Board-     ing Ho&se, Liver Lane, this city.       Young Barker the bellows-mender is     hoMe again, and looks much improved     by his vacation round-up among the out-     lying smithies. See his ad.    Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew  that quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing.  The  \"Court Circular\" pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified  respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those  disgraceful familiarities.  But even it could have been improved.  Do what one may, there is no getting an air of variety into a court  circular, I acknowledge that.  There is a profound monotonousness  about its facts that baffles and defeats one's sincerest efforts  to make them sparkle and enthuse.  The best way to manage--in fact,  the only sensible way--is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under  variety of form: skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle  of words.  It deceives the eye; you think it is a new fact; it  gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything;  this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a good  appetite, and perhaps never notice that it's a barrel of soup made  out of a single bean.  Clarence's way was good, it was simple,  it was dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is,  it was not the best way:                 COURT CIRCULAR.       On Monday, the king rode in the park.     \"  Tuesday,      \"      \"        \"     \"  Wendesday     \"      \"        \"     \"  Thursday      \"      \"        \"     \"  Friday,       \"      \"        \"     \"  Saturday      \"      \"        \"     \"  Sunday,       \"      \"        \"      However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it.  Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and  there, but there were not enough of them to amount to anything,  and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better  than was needed in Arthur's day and realm.  As a rule, the grammar  was leaky and the construction more or less lame; but I did not  much mind these things.  They are common defects of my own, and  one mustn't criticise other people on grounds where he can't stand  perpendicular himself.    I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole  paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had  to postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager  questions: What is this curious thing?  What is it for?  Is it a  handkerchief?--saddle blanket?--part of a shirt?  What is it made of?  How thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles.  Will it wear, do you think, and won't the rain injure it?  Is it  writing that appears on it, or is it only ornamentation?  They  suspected it was writing, because those among them who knew how  to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek, recognized some of  the letters, but they could make nothing out of the result as a  whole.  I put my information in the simplest form I could:    \"It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time.  It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain  what paper is.  The lines on it are reading matter; and not written  by hand, but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is.  A thousand of these sheets have been made, all exactly like this,  in every minute detail--they can't be told apart.\"  Then they all  broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration:    \"A thousand!  Verily a mighty work--a year's work for many men.\"    \"No--merely a day's work for a man and a boy.\"    They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two.    \"Ah-h--a miracle, a wonder!  Dark work of enchantment.\"    I let it go at that.  Then I read in a low voice, to as many as  could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of  the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and  was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through:  \"Ah-h-h!\"  \"How true!\"  \"Amazing, amazing!\"  \"These be the very  haps as they happened, in marvelous exactness!\"  And might they  take this strange thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine  it?--they would be very careful.  Yes.  So they took it, handling  it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing  come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture,  caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and  scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes.  These  grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes  --how beautiful to me!  For was not this my darling, and was not  all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent  tribute and unforced compliment to it?  I knew, then, how a mother  feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby,  and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend  their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest  of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it  were not, for that time.  I knew how she feels, and that there is  no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet,  that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half  so divine a contentment.    During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to  group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7247"],[0,"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Part 6.

I ordered that the things be carted  out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco, the son of Marco,  by Saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday.  He said I could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was  the rule of the house.  He also observed that he would throw in  a couple of miller-guns for the Marcos gratis--that everybody  was using them now.  He had a mighty opinion of that clever  device.  I said:    \"And please fill them up to the middle mark, too; and add that  to the bill.\"    He would, with pleasure.  He filled them, and I took them with  me.  I couldn't venture to tell him that the miller-gun was a  little invention of my own, and that I had officially ordered that  every shopkeeper in the kingdom keep them on hand and sell them  at government price--which was the merest trifle, and the shopkeeper  got that, not the government.  We furnished them for nothing.    The king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall.  He  had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of Gaul  with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon  had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again."]]]
