He  seems so very much--how shall I say it?--so very much sent to Me. But I  shall of course ask him whether he will consent. Trances and meditation  all day! And in the intervals such serenity and sweetness. You know,  for instance, how tiresome Robert is about his food. Well, last night  the mutton, I am bound to say, was a little underdone, and Robert was  beginning to throw it about his plate in the way he has. Well, my Guru  got up and just said, 'Show me the way to kitchen'--he leaves out  little words sometimes, because they don't matter--and I took him down,  and he said 'Peace!' He told me to leave him there, and in ten minutes  he was up again with a little plate of curry and rice and what had been  underdone mutton, and you never ate anything so good. Robert had most  of it and I had the rest, and my Guru was so pleased at seeing Robert  pleased. He said Robert had a pure white soul, just like you, only I  wasn't to tell him, because for him the Way ordained that he must find  it out for himself. And today before lunch again, the Guru went down in  the kitchen, and my cook told me he only took a pinch of pepper and a  tomato and a little bit of mutton fat and a sardine and a bit of  cheese, and he brought up a dish that you never saw equalled.  Delicious! I shouldn't a bit wonder if Robert began breathing-exercises  soon. There is one that makes you lean and young and exercises the  liver.\"    This sounded very entrancing.    \"Can't you teach me that?\" asked Georgie eagerly. He had been rather  distressed about his increasing plumpness for a year past, and about  his increasing age for longer than that. As for his liver he always had  to be careful.    She shook her head.    \"You cannot practise it except under tuition from an expert,\" she said.    Georgie rapidly considered what Hermy's and Ursy's comments would be  if, when they arrived tomorrow, he was found doing exercises under the  tuition of a Guru. Hermy, when she was not otter-hunting, could be very  sarcastic, and he had a clear month of Hermy in front of him, without  any otter-hunting, which, so she had informed him, was not possible in  August. This was mysterious to Georgie, because it did not seem likely  that all otters died in August, and a fresh brood came in like  caterpillars. If Hermy was here in October, she would otter-hunt all  morning and snore all afternoon, and be in the best of tempers, but the  August visit required more careful steering. Yet the prospect of being  lean and young and internally untroubled was wonderfully tempting.    \"But couldn't he be my Guru as well?\" he asked.    Quite suddenly and by some demoniac possession, a desire that had been  only intermittently present in Mrs Quantock's consciousness took full  possession of her, a red revolutionary insurgence hoisted its banner.  Why with this stupendous novelty in the shape of a Guru shouldn't she  lead and direct Riseholme instead of Lucia? She had long wondered why  darling Lucia should be Queen of Riseholme, and had, by momentary  illumination, seen herself thus equipped as far more capable of  exercising supremacy. After all, everybody in Riseholme knew Lucia's  old tune by now, and was in his secret consciousness quite aware that  she did not play the second and third movements of the Moonlight  Sonata, simply because they \"went faster,\" however much she might cloak  the omission by saying that they resembled eleven o'clock in the  morning and 3 p.m. And Mrs Quantock had often suspected that she did  not read one quarter of the books she talked about, and that she got up  subjects in the Encyclopaedia, in order to make a brave show that  covered essential ignorance. Certainly she spent a good deal of money  over entertaining, but Robert had lately made twenty times daily what  Lucia spent annually, over Roumanian oils. As for her acting, had she  not completely forgotten her words as Lady Macbeth in the middle of the  sleep-walking scene?    But here was Lucia, as proved by her note, and her A. D. C. Georgie,  wildly interested in the Guru. Mrs Quantock conjectured that Lucia's  plan was to launch the Guru at her August parties, as her own  discovery. He would be a novelty, and it would be Lucia who gave  Om-parties and breathing-parties and standing-on-one-leg parties, while  she herself, Daisy Quantock, would be bidden to these as a humble  guest, and Lucia would get all the credit, and, as likely as not,  invite the discoverer, the inventress, just now and then. Mrs  Quantock's Guru would become Lucia's Guru and all Riseholme would flock  hungrily for light and leading to The Hurst. She had written to Lucia  in all sincerity, hoping that she would extend the hospitality of her  garden-parties to the Guru, but now the very warmth of Lucia's reply  caused her to suspect this ulterior motive. She had been too  precipitate, too rash, too ill-advised, too sudden, as Lucia would say.  She ought to have known that Lucia, with her August parties coming on,  would have jumped at a Guru, and withheld him for her own parties,  taking the wind out of Lucia's August sails. Lucia had already suborned  Georgie to leave this note, and begin to filch the Guru away. Mrs  Quantock saw it all now, and clearly this was not to be borne. Before  she answered, she steeled herself with the triumph she had once scored  in the matter of the Welsh attorney.    \"Dear Georgie,\" she said, \"no one would be more delighted than I if my  Guru consented to take you as a pupil. But you can't tell what he will  do, as he said to me today, apropos of myself, 'I cannot come unless  I'm sent.' Was not that wonderful? He knew at once he had been sent to  me.\"    By this time Georgie was quite determined to have the Guru. The measure  of his determination may be gauged from the fact that he forgot all  about Lucia's garden-party.    \"But he called me his friend,\" he said. \"He told me I had a clean white  soul.\"    \"Yes; but that is his attitude towards everybody,\" said Mrs Quantock.  \"His religion makes it impossible for him to think ill of anybody.\"    \"But he didn't say that to Rush,\" cried Georgie, \"when he asked for  some brandy, to be put down to you.\"    Mrs Quantock's expression changed for a moment, but that moment was too  short for Georgie to notice it. Her face instantly cleared again.    \"Naturally he cannot go about saying that sort of thing,\" she observed.  \"Common people--he is of the highest caste--would not understand him.\"    Georgie made the direct appeal.    \"Please ask him to teach me,\" he said.    For a moment Mrs Quantock did not answer, but cocked her head sideways  in the direction of the pear-tree where a thrush was singing. It fluted  a couple of repeated phrases and then was silent again.    Mrs Quantock gave a great smile to the pear-tree.    \"Thank you, little brother,\" she said.    She turned to Georgie again.    \"That comes out of St. Francis,\" she said, \"but Yoga embraces all that  is true in every religion. Well, I will ask my Guru whether he will  take you as a pupil, but I can't answer for what he will say.\"    \"What does he--what does he charge for his lesson?\" asked Georgie.    The Christian Science smile illuminated her face again.    \"The word 'money' never passes his lips,\" she said. \"I don't think he  really knows what it means. He proposed to sit on the green with a  beggar's bowl but of course I would not permit that, and for the  present I just give him all he wants. No doubt when he goes away, which  I hope will not be for many weeks yet, though no one can tell when he  will have another call, I shall slip something suitably generous into  his hand, but I don't think about that. Must you be going? Good night,  dear Georgie. Peace! Om!\"    His last backward glance as he went out of the front door revealed her  standing on one leg again, just as he had seen her first. He remembered  a print of a fakir at Benares, standing in that attitude; and if the  stream that flowed into the Avon could be combined with the Ganges, and  the garden into the burning ghaut, and the swooping swallows into the  kites, and the neat parlour-maid who showed him out, into a Brahmin,  and the Chinese gong that was so prominent an object in the hall into a  piece of Benares brassware, he could almost have fancied himself as  standing on the brink of the sacred river. The marigolds in the garden  required no transmutation....    Georgie had quite \"to pull himself together,\" as he stepped round Mrs  Quantock's mulberry tree, and ten paces later round his own, before he  could recapture his normal evening mood, on those occasions when he was  going to dine alone. Usually these evenings were very pleasant and much  occupied, for they did not occur very often in this whirl of Riseholme  life, and it was not more than once a week that he spent a solitary  evening, and then, if he got tired of his own company, there were half  a dozen houses, easy of access where he could betake himself in his  military cloak, and spend a post-prandial hour. But oftener than not  when these occasions occurred, he would be quite busy at home, dusting  a little china, and rearranging ornaments on his shelves, and, after  putting his rings and handkerchief in the candle-bracket of the piano,  spending a serious hour (with the soft pedal down, for fear of  irritating Robert) in reading his share of such duets as he would be  likely to be called upon to play with Lucia during the next day or two.  Though he read music much better than she did, he used to \"go over\" the  part alone first, and let it be understood that he had not seen it  before. But then he was sure that she had done precisely the same, so  they started fair. Such things whiled away very pleasantly the hours  till eleven, when he went to bed, and it was seldom that he had to set  out Patience-cards to tide him over the slow minutes.

Now glory's arduous toils the breast inflame;    Now avarice thirsts, insensible of shame;    Now sloth unnerves them in voluptuous ease,    And the sweet pleasures of the body please.    With eager haste they rush the gulf within,    And their whole souls are centred in their sin.

Thus honored by the knowledge of thy way,    Shall men that honor to thyself repay,    And bid thy mighty works in praises ring,    As well befits a mortal's lips to sing;    More blest nor men nor heavenly powers can be    Than when their songs are of thy law and thee.      --Trans, by ELTON.    Jupiter is said to have divided the dominion of the universe  between himself and his two brothers, Neptune and Pluto, taking  heaven as his own portion, and having his throne and holding his  court on Mount Olympus, in Thessaly, while he assigned the dominion  of the sea to Neptune, and to Pluto the lower regions--the abodes  of the dead. Jupiter had several wives, both goddesses and mortals;  but last of all he married his sister Juno, who maintained  permanently the dignity of queen of the gods. The offspring of  Jupiter were numerous, comprising both celestial and terrestrial  divinities. The most noted of the former were Mars, the god of  war; Vulcan, the god of fire (the Olympian artist who forged the  thunder-bolts of Jupiter and the arms of all the gods); and Apollo,  the god of archery, prophecy, music, and medicine.      \"Mine is the invention of the charming lyre;    Sweet notes, and heavenly numbers I inspire.    Med'cine is mine: what herbs and simples grow    In fields and forests, all their powers I know,    And am the great physician called below.\"      --Apollo to Daphne, in OVID'S Metam. PRYDEN'S Trans.    Then come Mercury, the winged messenger, interpreter and ambassador  of the gods; Diana, queen of the woods and goddess of hunting,  and hence the counterpart of her brother Apollo; and finally,  Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and skill, who is said to have  Sprung full-armed from the brain of Jupiter.    Besides these divinities there were many others--as Ceres, the  goddess of grain and harvests; and Vesta, the goddess of home  joys and comforts, who presided over the sanctity of the domestic  hearth. There were also inferior gods and goddesses innumerable--such  as deities of the woods and the mountains, the meadows and the  rivers--some terrestrial, others celestial, according to the places  over which they were supposed to preside, and rising in importance  in proportion to the powers they manifested. Even the Muses, the  Fates, and the Graces were numbered among Grecian deities.    But while, undoubtedly, the great mass of the Grecian people  believed that their divinities were real persons, who presided  over the affairs of men, their philosophers, while encouraging  this belief as the best adapted to the understanding of the people,  took quite a different view of them, and explained the mythological  legends as allegorical representations of general physical and  moral truths. Thus, while Jupiter, to the vulgar mind, was the  god or the upper regions, \"who dwelt on the Summits of the highest  mountains, gathered the clouds about him, shook the air with his  thunder, and wielded the lightning as the instrument of his wrath,\"  yet in all this he was but the symbol of the ether or atmosphere  which surrounds the earth; and hence, the numerous fables of this  monarch of the gods may be considered merely as \"allegories which  typify the great generative power of the universe, displaying itself  in a variety of ways, and under the greatest diversity of forms.\"  So, also, Apollo was, in all likelihood, originally the sun-god  of the Asiatic nations; displaying all the attributes of that  luminary; and because fire is \"the great agent in reducing and  working the metals, Vulcan, the fire-god, naturally became an  artist, and is represented as working with hammer and tongs at  his anvil. Thus the Greeks, instead of worshipping Nature,  worshipped the Powers of Nature, as personified in the almost  infinite number of their deities.    The process by which the beings of Grecian mythology came into  existence, among an ardent and superstitious people, is beautifully  described by the poet WORDSWORTH as very naturally arising out  of the      Teeming Fancies of the Greek Mind.      The lively Grecian, in a land of hills,    Rivers, and fertile plains, and sounding shores,    Under a copse of variegated sky,    Could find commodious place for every god.    In that fair clime the lonely herdsman, stretched    On the soft grass through half a summer's day,    With music lulled his indolent repose;    And in some fit of weariness, if he,    When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear    A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds    Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetch'd    Even from the blazing chariot of the sun    A beardless youth, who touched a golden lute,    And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.      The night hunter, lifting a bright eye    Up toward the crescent moon, with grateful heart    Called on the lovely wanderer who bestow'd    That timely light to share his joyous sport.    And hence a beaming goddess, with her nymphs,    Across the lawn, and through the darksome grove    (Not unaccompanied with tuneful notes,    By echo multiplied from rock or cave),    Swept in the storm of chase, as moon and stars    Glance rapidly along the clouded heaven    When winds are blowing strong. The traveller slacked    His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thank'd    The Naiad. Sunbeams, upon distant hills    Gliding apace, with shadows in their train,    Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed    Into fleet Oreads sporting visibly.      The Zephyrs fanning, as they passed, their wings,    Lacked not for love fair objects, whom they wooed    With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,    Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,    From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth    In the low vale, or on steep mountain side--    And sometimes intermixed with stirring horns    Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard--    These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood    Of gamesome deities; or Pan himself,    The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring god.    Similar ideas are expressed in an article on the Nature of Early  History, by a celebrated English scholar, [Footnote: Henry George  Liddell, D. D., Dean of Christchurch College, Oxford.] who says:  \"The legends, or mythic fables, of the Greeks are chiefly connected  with religious ideas, and may mostly be traced to that sort of  awe or wonder with which simple and uneducated minds regard the  changes and movements of the natural world. The direct and easy  way in which the imagination of such persons accounts for marvelous  phenomena, is to refer them to the operation of Persons. When the  attention is excited by the regular movements of sun, and moon,  and stars, by the alternations of day and night, by the recurrence  of the seasons, by the rising and falling of the seas, by the  ceaseless flow of rivers, by the gathering of clouds, the rolling  of thunder, and the flashing of lightning, by the operations of  life in the vegetable and animal worlds--in short, by any exhibition  of an active and motive power--it is natural for uninstructed  minds to consider such changes and movements as the work of divine  Persons. In this manner the early Greek legends associate themselves  with personifications of the powers of Nature. All attempts to  account for the marvels which surround us are foregone; everything  is referred to the immediate operation of a god. 'Cloud-compelling  Zeus' is the author of the phenomenon of the air; 'Earth-shaking  Pos-ei'don,' of all that happens in the water under the earth;  Nymphs are attached to every spring or tree; De-me'ter, or Mother  Earth, for six months rejoices in the presence of Proserpine,  [Footnote: In some legends Proserpine is regarded as the daughter  of Mother Earth, or Ceres, and a personification of the growing  corn.] the green herb, her daughter, and for six months regrets  her absence in dark abodes beneath the earth.    \"This tendency to deify the powers of Nature is due partly to a  clear atmosphere and sunny climate, which incline a people to  live much in the open air in close communion with all that Nature  offers to charm the senses and excite the imagination; partly to  the character of the people, and partly to the poets who in early  times wrought these legendary tales into works which are read with  increased delight in ages when science and method have banished  the simple faith which procured acceptance for these legends.    \"Among the Greeks all these conditions were found existing. They  lived, so to say, out-of-doors; their powers of observation were  extremely quick, and their imagination singularly vivid; and their  ancient poems are the most noble specimens of the old legendary  tales that have been preserved in any country.\"    This tendency of the Grecian mind is also very happily set forth  in the following lines by PROFESSOR BLACKIE:      The old Greek men, the old Greek men--      No blinking fools were they,    But with a free and broad-eyed ken      Looked forth on glorious day.    They looked on the sun in their cloudless sky,      And they saw that his light was fair;    And they said that the round, full-beaming eye      Of a blazing GOD was there!      They looked on the vast spread Earth, and saw    The various fashioned forms, with awe      Of green and creeping life,    And said, \"In every moving form,"]]]
