He had not gone many yards when a dog emerged suddenly from the  undergrowth, and began to bark vigorously at him.    Mike liked dogs, and, on acquaintance, they always liked him. But when  you meet a dog in someone else's wood, it is as well not to stop in  order that you may get to understand each other. Mike began to thread  his way back through the trees.    He was too late.    \"Stop! What the dickens are you doing here?\" shouted a voice behind him.    In the same situation a few years before, Mike would have carried on,  and trusted to speed to save him. But now there seemed a lack of dignity  in the action. He came back to where the man was standing.    \"I'm sorry if I'm trespassing,\" he said. \"I was just having a look  round.\"    \"The dickens you--Why, you're Jackson!\"    Mike looked at him. He was a short, broad young man with a fair  moustache. Mike knew that he had seen him before somewhere, but he could  not place him.    \"I played against you, for the Free Foresters last summer. In passing  you seem to be a bit of a free forester yourself, dancing in among my  nesting pheasants.\"    \"I'm frightfully sorry.\"    \"That's all right. Where do you spring from?\"    \"Of course--I remember you now. You're Prendergast. You made fifty-eight  not out.\"    \"Thanks. I was afraid the only thing you would remember about me was  that you took a century mostly off my bowling.\"    \"You ought to have had me second ball, only cover dropped it.\"    \"Don't rake up forgotten tragedies. How is it you're not at Wrykyn? What  are you doing down here?\"    \"I've left Wrykyn.\"    Prendergast suddenly changed the conversation. When a fellow tells you  that he has left school unexpectedly, it is not always tactful to  inquire the reason. He began to talk about himself.    \"I hang out down here. I do a little farming and a good deal of  puttering about.\"    \"Get any cricket?\" asked Mike, turning to the subject next his heart.    \"Only village. Very keen, but no great shakes. By the way, how are you  off for cricket now? Have you ever got a spare afternoon?\"    Mike's heart leaped.    \"Any Wednesday or Saturday. Look here, I'll tell you how it is.\"    And he told how matters stood with him.    \"So, you see,\" he concluded, \"I'm supposed to be hunting for ruins and  things\"--Mike's ideas on the subject of archaeology were vague--\"but I  could always slip away. We all start out together, but I could nip back,  get onto my bike--I've got it down here--and meet you anywhere you  liked. By Jove, I'm simply dying for a game. I can hardly keep my hands  off a bat.\"    \"I'll give you all you want. What you'd better do is to ride straight to  Lower Borlock--that's the name of the place--and I'll meet you on the  ground. Anyone will tell you where Lower Borlock is. It's just off the  London road. There's a signpost where you turn off. Can you come next  Saturday?\"    \"Rather. I suppose you can fix me up with a bat and pads? I don't want  to bring mine.\"    \"I'll lend you everything. I say, you know, we can't give you a Wrykyn  wicket. The Lower Borlock pitch isn't a shirt front.\"    \"I'll play on a rockery, if you want me to,\" said Mike.           *       *       *       *       *    \"You're going to what?\" asked Psmith, sleepily, on being awakened and  told the news.    \"I'm going to play cricket, for a village near here. I say, don't tell a  soul, will you? I don't want it to get about, or I may get lugged in to  play for the school.\"    \"My lips are sealed. I think I'll come and watch you. Cricket I dislike,  but watching cricket is one of the finest of Britain's manly sports.  I'll borrow Jellicoe's bicycle.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That Saturday, Lower Borlock smote the men of Chidford hip and thigh.  Their victory was due to a hurricane innings of seventy-five by a  newcomer to the team, M. Jackson.        9    THE FIRE BRIGADE MEETING      Cricket is the great safety valve. If you like the game, and are in a  position to play it at least twice a week, life can never be entirely  gray. As time went on, and his average for Lower Borlock reached the  fifties and stayed there, Mike began, though he would not have admitted  it, to enjoy himself. It was not Wrykyn, but it was a very decent  substitute.    The only really considerable element making for discomfort now was Mr.  Downing. By bad luck it was in his form that Mike had been placed on  arrival; and Mr. Downing, never an easy form master to get on with,  proved more than usually difficult in his dealings with Mike.    They had taken a dislike to each other at their first meeting; and it  grew with further acquaintance. To Mike, Mr. Downing was all that a  master ought not to be, fussy, pompous, and openly influenced in his  official dealings with his form by his own private likes and dislikes.  To Mr. Downing, Mike was simply an unamiable loafer, who did nothing for  the school and apparently had none of the healthy instincts which should  be implanted in the healthy boy. Mr. Downing was rather strong on the  healthy boy.    The two lived in a state of simmering hostility, punctuated at intervals  by crises, which usually resulted in Lower Borlock having to play some  unskilled laborer in place of their star batsman, employed doing  \"overtime.\"    One of the most acute of these crises, and the most important, in that  it was the direct cause of Mike's appearance in Sedleigh cricket, had to  do with the third weekly meeting of the School Fire Brigade.    It may be remembered that this well-supported institution was under Mr.  Downing's special care. It was, indeed, his pet hobby and the apple  of his eye.    Just as you had to join the Archaeological Society to secure the esteem  of Mr. Outwood, so to become a member of the Fire Brigade was a safe  passport to the regard of Mr. Downing. To show a keenness for cricket  was good, but to join the Fire Brigade was best of all.    The Brigade was carefully organized. At its head was Mr. Downing, a sort  of high priest; under him was a captain, and under the captain a  vice-captain. These two officials were those sportive allies, Stone and  Robinson, of Outwood's house, who, having perceived at a very early date  the gorgeous opportunities for ragging which the Brigade offered to its  members, had joined young and worked their way up.    Under them were the rank and file, about thirty in all, of whom perhaps  seven were earnest workers, who looked on the Brigade in the right, or  Downing, spirit. The rest were entirely frivolous.    The weekly meetings were always full of life and excitement.    At this point it is as well to introduce Sammy to the reader.    Sammy, short for Sampson, was a young bull terrier belonging to Mr.  Downing. If it is possible for a man to have two apples of his eye,  Sammy was the other. He was a large, lighthearted dog with a white coat,  an engaging expression, the tongue of an anteater, and a manner which  was a happy blend of hurricane and circular saw. He had long legs, a  tenor voice, and was apparently made of India rubber.    Sammy was a great favorite in the school, and a particular friend of  Mike's, the Wrykynian being always a firm ally of every dog he met after  two minutes' acquaintance.    In passing, Jellicoe owned a clockwork rat, much in request during  French lessons.    We will now proceed to the painful details.           *       *       *       *       *    The meetings of the Fire Brigade were held after school in Mr. Downing's  form room. The proceedings always began in the same way, by the reading  of the minutes of the last meeting. After that the entertainment varied  according to whether the members happened to be fertile or not in ideas  for the disturbing of the peace.    Today they were in very fair form.    As soon as Mr. Downing had closed the minute book, Wilson, of the School  House, held up his hand.    \"Well, Wilson?\"    \"Please, sir, couldn't we have a uniform for the Brigade?\"    \"A uniform?\" Mr. Downing pondered.    \"Red, with green stripes, sir.\"    Red, with a thin green stripe, was the Sedleigh color.    \"Shall I put it to the vote, sir?\" asked Stone.    \"One moment, Stone.\"    \"Those in favor of the motion move to the left, those against it to the  right.\"    A scuffling of feet, a slamming of desk lids and an upset blackboard,  and the meeting had divided.    Mr. Downing rapped irritably on his desk.    \"Sit down!\" he said. \"Sit down! I won't have this noise and disturbance.  Stone, sit down--Wilson, get back to your place.\"    \"Please, sir, the motion is carried by twenty-five votes to six.\"    \"Please, sir, may I go and get measured this evening?\"    \"Please, sir--\"    \"Si-_lence!_ The idea of a uniform is, of course, out of the question.\"    \"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"    \"Be _quiet!_ Entirely out of the question. We cannot plunge into  needless expense. Stone, listen to me. I cannot have this noise and  disturbance! Another time when a point arises it must be settled by a  show of hands. Well, Wilson?\"    \"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"    \"Very useful as a protection against falling timbers, sir,\" said  Robinson.    \"I don't think my people would be pleased, sir, if they knew I was going  out to fires without a helmet,\" said Stone.    The whole strength of the company: \"Please, sir, may we have helmets?\"    \"Those in favor ...\" began Stone.    Mr. Downing banged on his desk. \"Silence! Silence!! Silence!!! Helmets  are, of course, perfectly preposterous.\"    \"Oo-oo-oo-oo, sir-r-r!\"    \"But, sir, the danger!\"    \"Please, sir, the falling timbers!\"    The Fire Brigade had been in action once and once only in the memory of  man, and that time it was a haystack which had burned itself out just as  the rescuers had succeeded in fastening the hose to the hydrant.    \"Silence!\"    \"Then, please, sir, couldn't we have an honor cap?

Some of them make small articles which are sold for their benefit.      _Correspondence._--The number of illiterates being very high (98 per  cent.), letters are comparatively few. The prisoners are allowed to  write three times a week, and a certain number of them get more educated  comrades to write for them. Correspondence is practically impossible for  those who belong to nomadic tribes.      _Religion._--Except one Copt, all the prisoners are Mahometans. There  are many imaums among them. Religious exercises are practised freely and  regularly.      _Discipline and Behaviour._--There are no complaints as to discipline,  and no attempts to escape have taken place. Despite racial diversities,  few quarrels take place among the prisoners, and the authorities seldom  need to interfere. We spoke to an old and infirm sheik who is treated  with particular regard and has a tent to himself; he told us that he is  in every way satisfied.          ~CONCLUSIONS~      The Red Cross International Committee, at Geneva, has since the  beginning of the war organised visits to the camps of prisoners of war  and of civilian prisoners in the various belligerent countries.    The members of the mission sent to Egypt, MM. Dr. F. Blanched, E.  Schoch, and F. Thormeyer, had already inspected camps in Germany,  France, Morocco and Russia. They may be allowed to compare the treatment  of the Egyptian prisoners with what they had seen elsewhere.    We express our deep gratitude to the English authorities for all the  facilities which they gave us for the accomplishment of our mission.    We will now sum up the whole set of observations made by us.    We visited the camps of Heliopolis, Maadi, the Citadel of Cairo,  Ras-el-Tin, Sidi Bishr, and the hospitals of Abbassiah and the Egyptian  Red Cross.    The camps are situated in healthy localities, and their dimensions are  amply sufficient for the population that they hold. The accommodation  seems to us exactly suited to the conditions of the country and climate.  Whether barracks are specially constructed for the prisoners, or stone  buildings are adapted to their use, these results are obtained.    Ventilation is sufficient everywhere. Measures of protection against the  cold, so difficult to render effective in other countries, are  unimportant here, owing to the mildness of the climate. Both boarded and  beaten earth floors are kept perfectly clean.    The bedding of the prisoners of war (non-commissioned officers and  privates) is composed of plaited rush mats, such as they are accustomed  to use when at home. These mats are regularly cleansed, and replaced as  they wear out. The officers, civilian prisoners and sick are provided  with iron spring beds, and mattresses generally stuffed with vegetable  fibre. For hospitals and officers, pillows and coverlets are also  supplied.    The blankets assigned to each prisoner vary from 3 to 5, a number which  we have never seen equalled in other places.    As to clothing, the military authorities furnish the men with all that  is necessary: 2 pairs of drawers, 2 flannel shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a  woollen belt, 1 neckerchief, 1 pair of trousers, a tunic of blue cloth  (or beige) and a cloak. All these garments are warm, clean, and of good  quality. All the Turks wear the national head-covering, the fez.  Decorations are allowed to be worn unrestrictedly. Owing to the date of  our visit we were not able to inspect the summer outfit, but the  prisoners told us that in the hot season they wore blue linen suits.    The civilian prisoners whose personal belongings were worn out received  a complete equipment.    The interned civilians were decently and sufficiently clothed.    Officers can order their clothes at their own expense from the town  tailors.    The private soldiers all wear the oriental slippers; non-commissioned  officers are given high-lows. All necessaries for repairs are provided  by the camp administration.    Everywhere we found the prisoners adequately and suitably dressed. No  external mark shows their position as prisoners of war, except a metal  medallion attached to the tunic.    We can assert that the commissariat of the Egyptian prisoners leaves  nothing to be desired. The fact that the prisoners prepare their own  food insures them a diet suitable to their tastes and customs. The  quantities supplied are calculated upon a very liberal scale. The  quality, whether of bread, meat or vegetables, is excellent and  constant.    The officers' mess is entrusted to private contract. They arrange their  own menu. The daily board is very moderate. Well-stocked canteens enable  them to obtain additions at prices fixed by the authorities.    The sick in hospital have a regimen suited to their condition prescribed  by the doctors. The milk provided is of excellent quality.    The health department is remarkably well organised everywhere. Drinking  water and water for washing purposes are equally abundant. There is an  _ad libitum_ supply for douches and baths in every camp. The  arrangements for laundering linen are very efficient.    Each camp is provided with a disinfecting furnace, linen and upper  garments being sterilised once weekly. There are no vermin anywhere.  Special pains are taken over the cleansing of prisoners newly arrived  from the front. The result of these measures and of the system of  vaccination is seen in the entire freedom of the camps from epidemics.    Turkish or English latrines are sufficient in number, odourless, and  regularly disinfected.    In every camp medical attention is given by a staff of first-class  English physicians, assisted by Armenian or Syrian doctors; hospital  orderlies keep the quarters in perfect order. The infirmaries are  spacious, well lighted, thoroughly stocked with drugs and with surgical  apparatus and dressings.    If dentistry be needed, which is rare among Ottomans, it is supplied by  dentists from the town or resident in the camps.    Cases of mutilation are provided with artificial limbs.    An examination of the medical register in all the camps has convinced  us of their good sanitary condition. The small number of sick, and the  slight character of the ailments, corroborate what we have ourselves  observed from the hygienic point of view. The death-rate is very low.    Deceased prisoners are interred with military honours and according to  the rites of their religion.    The space enclosed within the camps permits the prisoners to enjoy  walking exercise as well as outdoor games.    The English military authorities have not sanctioned compulsory work for  prisoners. Except for sanitary fatigue duties, prisoners have the whole  disposal of their own time. The numerous complaints provoked in other  countries by forced labour are entirely absent among the Ottoman  prisoners in Egypt.    Imaums take religious charge, and the prisoners have full liberty to  carry out their daily worship.    Correspondence is less active than elsewhere owing to the large  proportion of illiterate prisoners. Letters are long on the road because  of the great distances traversed. The censorship is carried out in a  liberal spirit and gives rise to no complaints. Money orders sent from  Turkey are paid in full; but their number, as well as that of parcels,  is restricted.    Assaults and corporal punishment are totally unknown in the camps. The  only disciplinary penalty, very seldom applied, consists of arrest for a  period fixed by the military authorities. We were happy to learn that  the discipline of the Turkish prisoners is excellent. Their own  commissariat officers exercise a good influence. We were ourselves  struck by the correct bearing of the men and their good humour. They  fully appreciate the English authorities' kindness to them.    To sum up, our conviction, based upon careful investigations, is that  the inspectors, commandants and officers of the camps treat the  prisoners with humanity and do all in their power to soften their lot.    We form the impression that the English Government's proposals  concerning repatriation of the interned civilians will soon bear fruit;  and we hope that this measure will be extended to all mutilated  prisoners of war.
