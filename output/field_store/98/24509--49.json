So also, while almost everybody has recognized the tremendous  strides in the elimination of child labor, in the payment of not  less than fair minimum wages and in the shortening of hours, we are  still feeling our way in solving problems which relate to self-  government in industry, especially where such self-government tends  to eliminate the fair operation of competition.    In this same process of evolution we are keeping before us the  objectives of protecting on the one hand industry against chiselers  within its own ranks, and on the other hand the consumer through  the maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the  unfair sky-rocketing of retail prices.    But, in addition to this our immediate task, we must still look to  the larger future.  I have pointed out to the Congress that we are  seeking to find the way once more to well-known, long-established  but to some degree forgotten ideals and values.  We seek the  security of the men, women and children of the nation.    That security involves added means of providing better homes for  the people of the nation.  That is the first principle of our future  program.    The second is to plan the use of land and water resources of this  country to the end that the means of livelihood of our citizens may  be more adequate to meet their daily needs.    And, finally, the third principle is to use the agencies of  government to assist in the establishment of means to provide sound  and adequate protection against the vicissitudes of modern life--in  other words, social insurance.    Later in the year I hope to talk with you more fully about these  plans.    A few timid people, who fear progress, will try to give you new and  strange names for what we are doing.  Sometimes they will call it  \"Fascism\", sometimes \"Communism\", sometimes \"Regimentation\",  sometimes \"Socialism\".  But, in so doing, they are trying to make  very complex and theoretical something that is really very simple  and very practical.    I believe in practical explanations and in practical policies.  I  believe that what we are doing today is a necessary fulfillment of  what Americans have always been doing--a fulfillment of old and  tested American ideals.    Let me give you a simple illustration:    While I am away from Washington this summer, a long needed  renovation of and addition to our White House office building is to  be started.  The architects have planned a few new rooms built into  the present all too small one-story structure.  We are going to  include in this addition and in this renovation modern electric  wiring and modern plumbing and modern means of keeping the offices  cool in the hot Washington summers.  But the structural lines of the  old Executive Office Building will remain.  The artistic lines of  the White House buildings were the creation of master builders when  our Republic was young.  The simplicity and the strength of the  structure remain in the face of every modern test.  But within this  magnificent pattern, the necessities of modern government business  require constant reorganization and rebuilding.    If I were to listen to the arguments of some prophets of calamity  who are talking these days, I should hesitate to make these  alterations.  I should fear that while I am away for a few weeks the  architects might build some strange new Gothic tower or a factory  building or perhaps a replica of the Kremlin or of the Potsdam  Palace.  But I have no such fears.  The architects and builders are  men of common sense and of artistic American tastes.  They know that  the principles of harmony and of necessity itself require that the  building of the new structure shall blend with the essential lines  of the old.  It is this combination of the old and the new that  marks orderly peaceful progress--not only in building buildings but  in building government itself.    Our new structure is a part of and a fulfillment of the old.    All that we do seeks to fulfill the historic traditions of the  American people.  Other nations may sacrifice democracy for the  transitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracies.  We are  restoring confidence and well-being under the rule of the people  themselves.  We remain, as John Marshall said a century ago,  \"emphatically and truly, a government of the people.\"  Our  government \"in form and in substance. . . emanates from them.  Its  powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on  them, and for their benefits.\"    Before I close, I want to tell you of the interest and pleasure  with which I look forward to the trip on which I hope to start in a  few days.  It is a good thing for everyone who can possibly do so to  get away at least once a year for a change of scene.  I do not want  to get into the position of not being able to see the forest  because of the thickness of the trees.    I hope to visit our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin  Islands, in the Canal Zone and in Hawaii.  And, incidentally, it  will give me an opportunity to exchange a friendly word of greeting  to the Presidents of our sister Republics:  Haiti, Colombia and  Panama.    After four weeks on board ship, I plan to land at a port in our  Pacific northwest, and then will come the best part of the whole  trip, for I am hoping to inspect a number of our new great national  projects on the Columbia, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, to see  some of our national parks and, incidentally, to learn much of  actual conditions during the trip across the continent back to  Washington.    While I was in France during the War our boys used to call the  United States \"God's country\".  Let us make it and keep it \"God's  country\".        September 30, 1934.      Three months have passed since I talked with you shortly after the  adjournment of the Congress.  Tonight I continue that report,  though, because of the shortness of time, I must defer a number of  subjects to a later date.    Recently the most notable public questions that have concerned us  all have had to do with industry and labor and with respect to  these, certain developments have taken place which I consider of  importance.  I am happy to report that after years of uncertainty,  culminating in the collapse of the spring of 1933, we are bringing  order out of the old chaos with a greater certainty of the  employment of labor at a reasonable wage and of more business at a  fair profit.  These governmental and industrial developments hold  promise of new achievements for the nation.    Men may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity  with respect to industry and business, but nearly all are agreed  that private enterprise in times such as these cannot be left  without assistance and without reasonable safeguards lest it  destroy not only itself but also our processes of civilization.  The  underlying necessity for such activity is indeed as strong now as  it was years ago when Elihu Root said the following very  significant words:    \"Instead of the give and take of free individual contract, the  tremendous power of organization has combined great aggregations of  capital in enormous industrial establishments working through vast  agencies of commerce and employing great masses of men in movements  of production and transportation and trade, so great in the mass  that each individual concerned in them is quite helpless by  himself.  The relations between the employer and the employed,  between the owners of aggregated capital and the units of organized  labor, between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,  and the great transporting and manufacturing and distributing  agencies, all present new questions for the solution of which the  old reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite  inadequate.  And in many directions, the intervention of that  organized control which we call government seems necessary to  produce the same result of justice and right conduct which obtained  through the attrition of individuals before the new conditions  arose.\"    It was in this spirit thus described by Secretary Root that we  approached our task of reviving private enterprise in March, 1933.  Our first problem was, of course, the banking situation because, as  you know, the banks had collapsed.  Some banks could not be saved  but the great majority of them, either through their own resources  or with government aid, have been restored to complete public  confidence.  This has given safety to millions of depositors in  these banks.  Closely following this great constructive effort we  have, through various federal agencies, saved debtors and creditors  alike in many other fields of enterprise, such as loans on farm  mortgages and home mortgages; loans to the railroads and insurance  companies and, finally, help for home owners and industry itself.    In all of these efforts the government has come to the assistance  of business and with the full expectation that the money used to  assist these enterprises will eventually be repaid.  I believe it  will be.    The second step we have taken in the restoration of normal business  enterprise has been to clean up thoroughly unwholesome conditions  in the field of investment.  In this we have had assistance from  many bankers and businessmen, most of whom recognize the past evils  in the banking system, in the sale of securities, in the deliberate  encouragement of stock gambling, in the sale of unsound mortgages  and in many other ways in which the public lost billions of  dollars.  They saw that without changes in the policies and methods  of investment there could be no recovery of public confidence in  the security of savings.  The country now enjoys the safety of bank  savings under the new banking laws, the careful checking of new  securities under the Securities Act and the curtailment of rank  stock speculation through the Securities"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#8)"],[1,"e, and for a brief instant Tom was dazed.  But then he caught his second wind and threw Caven backward.  Before the Irish lad could recover his balance, Tom struck him  in the nose, and over rolled his opponent.    A shout went up.  \"Good for Tom Rover!  That was a telling blow!  I Keep it up!\"    \"I'll fix you!\" gasped Jim Caven, as soon as he could speak.  \"I'll fix you!\" and staggering to his feet, he glanced around for  some weapon.  Nothing met his view but a garden spade which Peleg  Snuggers had been using, and catching this up he ran for Tom as if  to lay him low forever.    \"Caven, none of that!  Fight fair!\"    \"He shan't call me a thief!\" growled the Irish boy.  \"I'll show  him!\"  And he aimed a tremendous blow for Tom's head.    Had the spade fallen as intended Tom's cranium might have been split  in twain.  But now both Dick and Frank caught the unreasonable youth  and held him while Sam and several others took the spade away.    \"Stop it--here comes Mr. Strong!\" came the unexpected cry from  some outsiders.    \"Yes, give it up, Tom,\" whispered Sam.    \"We're in hot water enough, on account of that feast.\"    \"I'll give it up if Caven is willing,\" muttered    \"I'll meet you another time,\" answered Caven, and walked rapidly  away.    \"What is the row here?\" demanded George Strong, as he strode up.    \"Nothing, sir,\" said one of the boy.  \"Some of the fellows were  wrestling for possession of that spade.\"    \"Oh, I was afraid there was a fight,\" and Mr. Strong sauntered  off.    He was on his way to the barn, and presently the cadets saw him  come forth with the man-of-fall-work and the light spring wagon.    \"They are going to take poor Aleck to the Cedarville lock-up,\"  announced Fred.  \"Poor chap, I never thought this of him!\"    \"Nor I,\" answered Dick.  \"To me this affair isn't very clear.\"    \"I don't believe they will be able to convict him of the crime,\"  put in Sam.    An hour later Peleg Snuggers started away from Putnam Hall with  his prisoner.  Aleck looked the picture of misery as he sat on a  rear seat, his wrists bound together and one leg tied to the wagon  seat with a rope.    \"Dis am a mistake,\" he groaned.  \"I aint guilty nohow!\"    Some of the boys wished to speak to him, but this was not  permitted.  Soon the turnout was out of sight.    \"You may think I am hard with him,\" said Captain Putnam, later on,  \"but to tell the truth he does not come from a very good family  and he has a step-brother already in prison.\"     \"Aleck can't be held responsible for his stepbrother's doings,\"  murmured Tom, but not loud enough for the master to hear him.    A diligent search had been made for the other stolen articles, but  nothing more was brought to light.  If Pop had taken the things he  had either hidden them well or else disposed of them.    It was nearly nightfall when Peleg Snuggers drove back to the  Hall.  Dick and Tom met him just outside the gates and saw that  the man-of-all-work looked much dejected.    \"Well, Peleg, is he safe in jail?\" called out Tom.    \"No, he ain't,\" was the snappy reply.    \"Why, what did you do with him?\" questioned Dick quickly.    \"Do?  I didn't do nuthin--not me.  It was him as did it all--cut  that blessed rope and shoved me over the dashboard on to the  hosses!\" growled Snuggers.    \"Do you mean to say he got away from you?\" asked Tom.    \"Yes, he did--got away like a streak o' fightnin', thet's wot he  did, consarn him!\"  And without another word Peleg drove to the  rear of the Hall, put his team in the barn, and went in to report  to Captain Putnam.    Another row resulted, and this nearly cost the utility Man his  position.  But it appeared that he was not so much to blame that  Alexander Pop had taken him unawares and finally he was sent away  to his work with the caution to be more careful in the future.  Before night and during the next day a hunt was made for the  colored man, but he had left the vicinity entirely, gone to New  York, and shipped on one of the outward-bound ocean vessels.  The  Rover boys fancied that they would never see him again, but in  this they were mistaken.          CHAPTER IX    THE ROVER BOYS ON WHEELS      \"Say, fellows, but this is the greatest sport yet!\"    \"I feel like flying, Tom,\" said Dick Rover.  \"I never thought  wheeling was so grand.\"    \"Nor I,\" came from Sam Rover.  \"Where shall we go this afternoon?\"    It was several weeks later, and the scholars were having a  half-holiday.  Just six days before, Randolph Rover had surprised  his three nephews by sending each a handsome bicycle, and it had  taken them hardly any time to learn how to handle the machines.    \"Let us take a ride over to Chardale,\" said Dick.  \"I understand  that the roads are very good in that direction.\"    \"All right, I'm willing,\" answered Sam, and Tom said the same.  Soon the three brothers were on the way, Dick leading and Tom and  Sam coming behind, side by side.    It was an ideal day for cycling, cool and clear, and the road they  had elected to take was inviting to the last degree, with its  broad curves, its beautiful trees, and the mountainous views far  to the north and west.    \"It's a wonder we didn't get wheels before,\" observed Dick.  \"This  beats skating or riding a to bits.\"    \"Just you look out that you don't take a header!\" warned Tom.  \"This road is all right, but a loose stone might do a pile of  damage.\"    \"I've got my eye on the road,\" answered his big brother.  \"For the  matter of that, we'll all have to keep our eyes open.\"    To reach Chardale they had to cross several bridges and then  descend a long hill, at the foot of which ran the railroad to  several towns north and south.    \"Come on!\" cried Tom, and spurted ahead.  With a laugh, Sam tried  to catch up to him, but could not.  \"Now for a coast!\" went on the  fun-loving Rover, as the hill was gained, and on he started, his  wheel flying faster and faster as yard after yard was covered.    \"My gracious, Tom! look out or you'll be smashed up!\" yelled Dick.  \"Put on your brake!\"    \"Can't,\" came back the answer.  \"I took it off entirely this  morning.\"    This reply had scarcely reached Dick's ears when another sound  came to him which disturbed him greatly.    Far away he heard the whistle of a locomotive as it came around  the bottom of the hill.  Looking in the direction, he saw the puff  of smoke over the treetops.    He tried to cry out, but now the road was rather rough, and he had  to pay strict attention 'to where he was riding.    \"Tom's going to get into trouble,\" gasped Sam, as he ranged up  alongside of his elder brother.  \"The road crosses the railroad  tracks just below here.\"    \"I know it, Sam.  I wish we could make him come back.\"    As Dick finished he saw a chance to stop and at once dismounted.  Then he yelled at the top of his lungs:    \"Tom, stop!  Stop, or you'll run into the railroad train!\"    Sam also came to a halt and set up a shout.  But Tom was now  speeding along like the wind and did not hear them.    Nearer and nearer he shot to the railroad tracks.  Then the  whistle of the locomotive broke upon his ears and he turned pale.    \"I don't want to run into that train,\" he muttered, and tried to  bring his bicycle to a halt.    But the movement did not avail without a brake, and so he was  compelled to seek for some side path into which he might guide his  machine.    But, alas! the road was hemmed in with a heavy woods on one side  and a field of rocks on the other.  A sudden stop, therefore,  would mean a bad spill, and Tom had no desire to break his bones  by any such proceeding.    Nearer and nearer he drew to the railroad crossing.  He could now  hear the puffing of the engine quite plainly and caught a glimpse  of the long train over the rocks to his left.  On he bounded until  the crossing itself came into view.  He was less than a hundred  yards from it--and the oncoming engine was about the same  distance away!    There are some moments in one's life that seem hours, and the  present fraction of time was of that sort to poor Tom.  He had a  vision of a terrific smash-up, and of Dick and Sam picking up his  lifeless remains from the railroad tracks.  \"I'm a goner!\" he  muttered, and then, just before the tracks were reached, he made  one wild, desperate leap in the direction of a number of bushes  skirting the woods.  He turned over and over, hit hard--and for  several seconds knew no more.    When Dick and Sam came up they found Tom sitting in the very midst  of the bushes.  The bicycle lay among the rocks with the handle-bars  and the spokes of the front wheel badly twisted.    \"Are you much hurt, Tom?\" asked his big brother sympathetically,  yet glad to learn that Tom had not been ground to death under the  train, which had now passed the crossing.    \"I don't know if I'm hurt or not,\" was the 'slow answer, as Tom  held his handkerchief to his nose, which was bleeding.    \"I tried to plow up these bushes with my head, that's all. I guess  my ankle is sprained, too.\"    \"You can't ride that wheel any further,\" announced Sam.    \"I don't want to ride.  I've had enough, for a few days at least.\"    It was a good quarter of an hour before Tom felt like standing up.  Then he found his ankle pained him so much that walking was out of  the question.    \"I'm sure I don't know what I am going to do,\" he said ruefully.  \"I can't walk and I can't ride, and I don't know as I can stay  here.\"    \"Perhaps Dick and I can carry you to Hopeton,\" said Sam,  mentioning a small town just beyond the railroad tracks.    \"It will be a big job. If you-- Here comes a wagon.  Perhaps the  driver of that will give me a lift.\"    As Tom finished a large farm wagon rattled into sight, drawn by a  pair of bony horses and driven by a tall, lank farmer.    \"Hullo, wot's the matter?\" asked the farmer, as he drew rein.  \"Had a breakdown?\"    \"No, I've had a smash-up,\" answered Tom.    \"My brother's ankle is sprained, and we would like to know if you  "]]]
