R. Simeon said, \"Be careful in reading the  _Shema_ (43) and the _Amidah_ (44); and when thou prayest, consider  not thy prayer as a fixed (mechanical) task, but as (an appeal for)  mercy and grace before the All-present, as it is said, 'For he is  gracious and full of mercy, slow to anger, and abounding in  loving-kindness, and repenteth him of the evil' (45); and be not  wicked in thine own esteem\" (46).  19. R. Eleazar said, \"Be diligent  in studying _Torah_, and know what answer to give to the unbeliever  (47); know also before whom thou toilest, and who thy Employer is, who  will pay thee the reward of thy labor.\"          (37) Cf. chapter IV, 15.          (38) Man should repent every day of his life, for he knows not        on what day he may die (_Shabbat_, 153a).          (39) One who wishes to warm himself remains a certain distance        away from the fire; if he approaches too near, he is burned;        so, do not endeavor to become too intimate with the wise, as        their opinion of you may change to your detriment.  The        \"bite,\" the \"sting,\" and the \"hiss\" represent the terribleness        of the looks of the wise who have been angered.          (40) Passion, evil nature, or evil inclination.          (41) Misanthropy.          (42) In making man's highest ideal the comprehension of God,        Maimonides, in the _Shemonah Perakim_, supports his view by        referring to the latter part of this verse.  He says, \"The        sages of blessed memory, too, have summed up this idea in so        few words and so concisely, at the same time elucidating the        whole matter with such complete thoroughness, that when one        considers the brevity with which they express this great and        mighty thought in its entirety, about which others have        written whole books and yet without adequately explaining it,        one truly recognizes that the Rabbis undoubtedly spoke through        divine inspiration.  This saying is found among their        precepts, and is, 'Let all thy deeds be done in the name of        God.'\"  See Gorfinkle, _The Eight Chapters_, p. 73.          (43) This prayer consists of three portions of the Pentateuch        (Deut. VI, 4-9; XI, 13-21; Num. XV, 37-41), and gets its name        from the initial word of the first portion.  It is appointed        to be read twice daily, in the morning and in the evening.  On        the time when the _Shema_ is to be read, see _Berachot_ I, 1.        See Schurer, _History_, II, ii, 77, 83, _et seq._;        Friedlander, _Jewish Religion_, pp. 430, 435; _Jewish        Encyclopedia_, art. _Shema_, and Adler, in the _Jewish Review_        (London, 1910), vol. I, number 2, p. 159.          (44) An important part of the ritual said at the daily        morning, afternoon, and evening service, and also at the        additional service on Sabbaths and holy days, is  known as (1)        _Tefillah_ (prayer)_, or (2) _Shemoneh Esreh_ (eighteen), or        (3) _Amidah_ (standing).  It is known as _Tefillah_ because it        is considered the prayer _par excellence;_ as _Shemoneh Esreh_        because originally it consisted of eighteen prayers (now        nineteen); and as _Amidah_ (by Sephardic Jews) because it must        be said standing.  The _Shema_ and the _Shemoneh Esreh_ have        been appropriately styled the \"two pillars of the fabric of        the liturgy.\"  See Schurer, _ibid._; Friedlander, _ibid._, pp.        430, 437; in the _Jewish Encyclopedia, art. _Shemoneh Esreh_;        Schechter, _Studies_, II, pp. 67068; Adler, _ibid._, p. 159;        and Herford, _ibid._, pp. 298-299.          (45) Joel II, 13.          (46) Do not do what your conscience tells you is wrong, even        though it does not appear to others as such; or, do not sin in        secret, thinking that you will escape punishment because        others do not see you.          (47) _Apikuros_ is a term originally used to designate a        follower of the philosopher Epicurus, whose axiom was that        \"happiness or enjoyment is the _summum bonum_ of life.\"        Later, this word was used by the Rabbis to designate a        free-thinker, a heretic, an unbeliever, or a despiser of the        Law, Jewish or non-Jewish.  Josephus (_Antiquities_, X, 11, 7,        ed. Whiston-Margoliouth, p. 300) describes the Epicureans as        those \"who cast providence out of human life, and do not        believe that God takes care of the affairs of the world, nor        that the universe is governed and continued in being by that        blessed and immortal nature, but say that the world is carried        along of its own accord without a ruler and a curator.\"        Maimonides, in his commentary on _Sanhedrin_, X, 1, derives        the word from the Hebrew, [hefkeir (hey-fey-kuf-resh)],        \"freedom,\" and defines it as one who refuses obedience to the        Law.  Schechter (_Studies in Judaism_, I, p. 158) says, \"It        implies rather a frivolous treatment of the words of Scripture        and tradition.\"  See the _Jewish Encyclopedia_ art.        _Apikuros_, and Barton, _Ecclesiastes_, p. 41.  This verse may        also be rendered, \"Study _Torah_, and also know ([v'da        (vov-daled-ayin)]) how to answer an unbeliever,\" meaning that        first one should study _Torah_ and _Talmud_, and then give his        time to learning other knowledge, so as to be able to refute        those who stray from the truth.    20. Rabbi Tafron (48) said, \"The day is short, the task is great (49),  the laborers are sluggish, the reward is much, and the Master of the  house (50) is urgent.\"  21. He also used to say, \"It is not thy duty  to complete the work, but neither art thou free to desist from it; if  thou hast studied much _Torah_, much reward will be given thee; and  faithful is thy Employer to pay thee the reward of thy labor; and know  that the grant of reward unto the righteous will be in the time to  come\" (51).    Rabbi Chanania, the son of Akashia, said, \"The Holy One, blessed be  He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore He gave them a  copious _Torah_ and many commandments, as it is said, 'It pleased the  Lord, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the _Torah_ and make it  honorable'\".          (48) A contemporary of Jochanan ben Zakkai's five disciples        and of Akiba.  See Bacher, _ibid._, pp. 348-358, and Meyer,        _ibid._, p. 179.          (49) The day, _i.e._, the life of man, is brief.  Art is long,        but life is short.          (50) _I.e._, God.          (51) A man cannot finish the work of the world, yet he must        not yield to idleness and despair, but must do his share to        the best of his ability.  His reward will come in the future.                CHAPTER III    All Israel have a portion in the world to come, and it is said, \"And  thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for  ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be  glorified\".    1. Akabia (1), the son of Mahalalel, said, \"Consider three things, and  thou wilt not come within the power of sin (2): know whence thou  camest, and whither thou art going, and before whom thou wilt in the  future have to give an account and reckoning (3).  Whence thou camest:  from a fetid drop; whether thou art going: to a place of dust, worms,  and maggots (4); and before whom thou wilt in the future have to give  an account and reckoning: before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy  One, blessed be He.\"          (1) He lived about the middle of the first century.          (2) Cf. chapter II, 1.          (3) Compare with this saying the exposition by Akiba of Eccl.        XII, 1: [uzechor et bor'ech (bor'ech is:        bet-vov-resh-alef-yud-chof(sofit)] \"but remember thy creator.\"         Playing upon the word [bor'ech], he says, \"Remember thy        source ([bet-alef-resh-chof(sofit)]), thy grave        ([bet-vov-resh-chof(sofit)]), and thy creator        ([bet-resh-alef-chof(sofit)]),\" _Kohelet Rabbah, ad. loc._  If        man thinks of whence he comes, he is rendered humble; if he        reflects upon whither he is going, he prizes worldly things        lightly; and if he considers HIm before whom he must give an        account, he obeys God's laws.          (4) Cf. Job XXV, 6: \"How much less the mortal, the mere worm        ([rimah])? and the son of the earth, the mere maggot        ([toleah])?\" can be pure in God's eyes.    2. R. Chanina, the Vice-High-Priest (5), said, \"Pray for the welfare  of the government, since but for the fear thereof men would swallow  each other alive\" (6).          (5) Chief of the priests, adjutant high-priest.  The _segan_        was next in rank to the high-priest.  None could be appointed        high-priest unless he had occupied the office of the _segan_        (Palestinian _Talmud_, _Yoma_, III, 41a, top).  According to        Schurer, he was \"the captain of the Temple,\" whose duty it was        to superintend arrangements for keeping order in and around        the Temple.  He was also present at all important functions in        which the high-priest took part, such as the drawing of lots        in the case of the two goats on _Yom Kippur_ (_Yoma III, 9,        IV, 1); when reading from the _Torah_ (_Yoma_, VII, 1; _Sotah_        VII, 7, 8), and when offering the daily sacrifice (_Tamid_        VII, 3).  Rabbi Chanina was the last to bear this title, his        son being known as Simeon ben ha-Segan.  See Bacher, _Agada        der Tanaiten_, pp. 55-58, Schurer, _History_, II, i, 257-259.

XXXIX, 7, \"And seek the peace of the city whither        I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto        the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have        peace,\" and _Abodah Zarah_, 3b.    3. R. Chananiah, the son of Teradion (7), said, \"If two sit"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8556"],[0,"The History of England from the Norman Conquest to the Death of John (1066-1216) (#8)"],[1,"m's  opinion of the situation. He would have been the last man to venture such  a step if he had believed the risk to be great. And the event justified  his judgment. The insurrectionary movements which called him back clearly  appear to have been, not so much efforts of the nation to throw off a  foreign yoke, as revolts excited by the oppression and bad government of  those whom he had left in charge of the kingdom.    On the eve of his departure he confided the care of his new kingdom to  two of his followers whom he believed the most devoted to himself, the  south-east to his half brother Odo, and the north to William Fitz Osbern.  Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, but less an ecclesiastic, according to the ideals  of the Church, than a typically feudal bishop, was assigned the  responsibility for the fortress of Dover, was given large estates in Kent  and to the west of it, and was probably made earl of that county at this  time. William Fitz Osbern was the son of the duke's guardian, who had  been murdered for his fidelity during William's minority, and they had  been boys together, as we are expressly told. He was appointed to be  responsible for Winchester and to hold what might be called the marches,  towards the unoccupied north and west. Very probably at this time also he  was made Earl of Hereford? Some other of the leading nobles of the  Conquest had been established in their possessions by this date, as we  know on good evidence, like Hugh of Grantmesnil in Hampshire, but the  chief dependence of the king was apparently upon these two, who are  spoken of as having under their care the minor holders of the castles  which had been already established.    No disorders in Normandy demanded the duke's return. Everything had been  quiet there, under the control of Matilda and those who had been  appointed to assist her. William's visit at this time looks less like a  necessity than a parade to make an exhibition of the results of his  venture. He took with him a splendid assortment of plunder and a long  train of English nobles, among whom the young atheling Edgar, Stigand,  Archbishop of Canterbury, Earls Edwin and Morcar, Waltheof, son of  Siward, the Abbot of Glastonbury, and a thane of Kent, are mentioned by  name. The favour and honour with which William treated these men did not  disguise from them the fact that they were really held as hostages. No  business of especial importance occupied William during his nine months'  stay in Normandy. He was received with great rejoicing on every hand,  especially in Rouen, where Matilda was staying, and his return and  triumphal progress through the country reminded his panegyrist of the  successes and glories of the great Roman commanders. He distributed with  a free hand, to the churches and monasteries, the wealth which he had  brought with him. A great assembly gathered to celebrate with him the  Easter feast at the abbey of Fécamp. His presence was sought to add éclat  to the dedication of new churches. But the event of the greatest  importance which occurred during this visit to the duchy was the falling  vacant of the primacy of Normandy by the death of Maurilius, Archbishop  of Rouen. The universal choice for his successor was Lanfranc, the  Italian, Abbot of St. Stephen's at Caen, who had already made evident to  all the possession of those talents for government which he was to  exercise in a larger field. But though William stood ready, in form at  least, to grant his sanction, Lanfranc declined the election, which then  fell upon John, Bishop of Avranches, a friend of his. Lanfranc was sent  to Rome to obtain the pallium for the new archbishop, but his mission was  in all probability one of information to the pope regarding larger  interests than those of the archbishopric of Rouen.    In the meantime, affairs had not run smoothly in England. We may easily  guess that William's lieutenants, especially his brother, had not failed  on the side of too great gentleness in carrying out his directions to  secure the land with garrisons and castles. In various places unconnected  with one another troubles had broken out. In the north, where Copsi had  been made Earl of Northumberland, an old local dynastic feud was still  unsettled, and the mere appointment of an earl would not bring it to an  end. Copsi was slain by his rival, Oswulf, who was himself soon afterward  killed, but the Norman occupation had still to be begun. In the west a  more interesting resistance to the Norman advance had developed near  Hereford, led by Edric, called the Wild, descendant of a noble Saxon  house. He had enlisted the support of the Welsh, and in retaliation for  attacks upon himself had laid waste a large district in Herefordshire.  Odo had had in his county an insurrection which threatened for a moment  to have most serious consequences, but which had ended in a complete  failure. The men of Kent, planning rebellion, had sent across the channel  to Eustace, Count of Boulogne, who believed that he had causes of  grievance against William, and had besought him to come to their aid in  an attempt to seize the fortress of Dover. Eustace accepted the  invitation and crossed over at the appointed time, but his allies had not  all gathered when he arrived, and the unsteady character of the count  wrecked the enterprise. He attacked in haste, and when he failed to carry  the castle by storm, he retired in equal haste and abandoned the  undertaking. William judged him too important a man to treat with  severity, and restored him to his favour. Besides these signs which  revealed the danger of an open outbreak, William undoubtedly knew that  many of the English had left the country and had gone in various  directions, seeking foreign aid. His absence could not be prolonged  without serious consequences, and in December, 1067, he returned to  England.    [1] William of Poitiers, in Migne's Patrologia Latina, cxlix,  1258, and see F. Baring, in Engl. Hist. Rev., xiii. 18 (1898).    [2] Orderic Vitalis, ii. 158 (ed. Le Prevost).    [3] Round, Feudal England, p. 292.          CHAPTER II      THE SUBJUGATION OF LAND AND CHURCH    With William's return to England began the long and difficult task of  bringing the country completely under his control. But this was not a  task that called for military genius. Patience was the quality most  demanded, and William's patience gave way but rarely. There was no army  in the field against him. No large portion of the land was in  insurrection. No formal campaign was necessary. Local revolts had to be  put down one after another, or a district dealt with where rebellion was  constantly renewed. The Scandinavian north and the Celtic west were the  regions not yet subdued, and the seats of future trouble. Three years  were filled with this work, and the fifteen years that follow were  comparatively undisturbed. For the moment after his return, William was  occupied with no hostilities. The Christmas of 1067 was celebrated in  London with the land at peace, Normans and English meeting together to  all appearance with cordial good-will. A native, Gospatric, was probably  at this time made Earl of Northumberland, in place of Copsi, who had been  killed, though this was an exercise of royal power in form rather than in  reality, since William's authority did not yet reach so far. A Norman,  Remigius, was made Bishop of Dorchester, in place of Wulfwig, who had  died while the king was in Normandy, and William's caution in dealing  with the matter of Church reform is shown in the fact that the new bishop  received his consecration from Stigand. It is possible also that another  heavy tax was imposed at this time.    But soon after Christmas, William felt himself obliged to take the field.  He had learned that Exeter, the rich commercial city of the south-west,  was making preparations to resist him. It was in a district where Harold  and his family had had large possessions. His mother was in the city, and  perhaps others of the family. At least some English of prominence seem to  have rallied around them. The citizens had repaired and improved their  already strong walls. They had impressed foreigners, merchants even, into  their service, and were seeking allies in other towns. William's rule had  never yet reached into that part of England, and Exeter evidently hoped  to shut him out altogether. When the king heard of these preparations, he  acted with his usual promptitude, but with no sacrifice of his diplomatic  skill. The citizens should first be made to acknowledge their intentions.  A message was sent to the city, demanding that the oath of allegiance to  himself be taken. The citizens answered that they would take no oath, and  would not admit him within the walls, but that they were willing to pay  him the customary tribute. William at once replied that he was not  accustomed to have subjects on such conditions, and at once began his  march against the city. Orderic Vitalis thought it worthy of note, that  in this army William was using Englishmen for the first time as soldiers.    When the hostile army drew near to the town, the courage of some of the  leading men failed, and they went out to seek terms of peace. They  promised to do whatever was commanded, and they gave hostages, but on  their return they found their negotiations disavowed and the city  determined to stand a siege. This lasted only eighteen days. Some decided  advantage which the Normans gained--the undermining of the walls seems  to be implied--induced the city to try again for terms. The clergy,  with their sacred books and relics, accompanied the deputation, which  obtained from the king better promises than had been hoped for. For some  reason William departed from his usual custom of severity to those who  resisted. He overlooked their evil conduct, ordered no confiscations, and  even stationed guards in the gates to keep out the soldiers who would  have helped themselves to "]]]
