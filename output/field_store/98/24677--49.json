Then twilight  comes, and the roads lead home to supper and the curling smoke above the  roof. But at night where run the roads? It's dark beyond the candle's  flare--where run the roads of night.    My brother and I have become sleepy. We lop over against my grandfather--    We awake with a start. There is a gayly lighted horse-car jingling beside  us. The street lights show us into harbor. We are home at last.          The Man Of Grub Street Comes From His Garret      I have come to live this winter in New York City and by good fortune I  have found rooms on a pleasant park. This park, which is but one block in  extent, is so set off from the thoroughfares that it bears chiefly the  traffic that is proper to the place itself. Grocery carts jog around and  throw out their wares. Laundry wagons are astir. A little fat tailor on an  occasion carries in an armful of newly pressed clothing with suspenders  hanging. Dogs are taken out to walk but are held in leash, lest a taste of  liberty spoil them for an indoor life. The center of the park is laid out  with grass and trees and pebbled paths, and about it is a high iron fence.  Each house has a key to the enclosure. Such social infection, therefore, as  gets inside the gates is of our own breeding. In the sunny hours nurses and  children air themselves in this grass plot. Here a gayly painted wooden  velocipede is in fashion. At this minute there are several pairs of fat  legs a-straddle this contrivance. It is a velocipede as it was first made,  without pedals. Beau Brummel--for the velocipede dates back to him--may  have walked forth to take the waters at Tunbridge Wells on a vehicle not  far different, but built to his greater stature. There is also a trickle  of drays and wagons across the park--a mere leakage from the streets, as  though the near-by traffic in the pressure had burst its pipes. But only at  morning and night when the city collects or discharges its people, are the  sidewalks filled. Then for a half hour the nozzle of the city plays a full  stream on us.    The park seems to be freer and more natural than the streets outside. A man  goes by gesticulating as though he practiced for a speech. A woman adjusts  her stocking on the coping below the fence with the freedom of a country  road. A street sweeper, patched to his office, tunes his slow work to fit  the quiet surroundings. Boys skate by or cut swirls upon the pavement in  the privilege of a playground.    My work--if anything so pleasant and unforced can carry the name--is  done at a window that overlooks this park. Were it not for several high  buildings in my sight I might fancy that I lived in one of the older  squares of London. There is a look of Thackeray about the place as though  the Osbornes might be my neighbors. A fat man who waddles off his steps  opposite, if he would submit to a change of coat, might be Jos Sedley  starting for his club to eat his chutney. If only there were a crest above  my bell-pull I might even expect Becky Sharp in for tea. Or occasionally I  divert myself with the fancy that I am of a still older day and that I have  walked in from Lichfield--I choose the name at hazard--with a tragedy in my  pocket, to try my fortune. Were it not for the fashion of dress in the park  below and some remnant of reason in myself, I could, in a winking moment,  persuade myself that my room is a garret and my pen a quill. On such  delusion, before I issued on the street to seek my coffee-house, I would  adjust my wig and dust myself of snuff.    But for my exercise and recreation--which for a man of Grub Street is  necessary in the early hours of afternoon when the morning fires have  fallen--I go outside the park. I have a wide choice for my wanderings. I  may go into the district to the east and watch the children play against  the curb. If they pitch pennies on the walk I am careful to go about, for  fear that I distract the throw. Or if the stones are marked for hop-scotch,  I squeeze along the wall. It is my intention--from which as yet my  diffidence withholds me--to present to the winner of one of these contests  a red apple which I shall select at a corner stand. Or an ice wagon pauses  in its round, and while the man is gone there is a pleasant thieving of  bits of ice. Each dirty cheek is stuffed as though a plague of mumps had  fallen on the street. Or there may be a game of baseball--a scampering  on the bases, a home-run down the gutter--to engage me for an inning.  Or shinny grips the street. But if a street organ comes--not a mournful  one-legged box eked out with a monkey, but a big machine with an extra man  to pull--the children leave their games. It was but the other day that I  saw six of them together dancing on the pavement to the music, with skirts  and pigtails flying. There was such gladness in their faces that the  musician, although he already had his nickel, gave them an extra tune. It  was of such persuasive gayety that the number of dancers at once went up to  ten and others wiggled to the rhythm. And for myself, although I am past my  sportive days, the sound of a street organ, if any, would inflame me to a  fox-trot. Even a surly tune--if the handle be quickened--comes from the box  with a brisk seduction. If a dirge once got inside, it would fret until it  came out a dancing measure.    In this part of town, on the better streets, I sometimes study the fashions  as I see them in the shops and I compare them with those of uptown stores.  Nor is there the difference one might suppose. The small round muff that  sprang up this winter in the smarter shops won by only a week over the  cheaper stores. Tan gaiters ran a pretty race. And I am now witness to  a dead heat in a certain kind of fluffy rosebud dress. The fabrics are  probably different, but no matter how you deny it, they are cut to a common  pattern.    In a poorer part of the city still nearer to the East River, where  smells of garlic and worse issue from cellarways, I came recently on  a considerable park. It was supplied with swings and teeters and drew  children on its four fronts. Of a consequence the children of many races  played together. I caught a Yiddish answer to an Italian question. I fancy  that a child here could go forth at breakfast wholly a Hungarian and come  home with a smack of Russian or Armenian added. The general games that  merged the smaller groups, aided in the fusion. If this park is not already  named--a small chance, for it shows the marks of age--it might properly be  called _The Park of the Thirty Nations_.    Or my inclination may take me to the lower city. Like a poor starveling  I wander in the haunts of wealth where the buildings are piled to forty  stories, and I spin out the ciphers in my brain in an endeavor to compute  the amount that is laid up inside. Also, lest I become discontented with my  poverty, I note the strain and worry of the faces that I meet. There is a  story of Tolstoi in which a man is whispered by his god that he may possess  such land as he can circle in a day. Until that time he had been living on  a fertile slope of sun and shadow, with fields ample for his needs. But  when the whisper came, at a flash, he pelted off across the hills. He ran  all morning, but as the day advanced his sordid ambition broadened and he  turned his course into a wider and still wider circle. Here a pleasant  valley tempted him and he bent his path to bring it inside his mark. Here  a fruitful upland led him off. As the day wore on he ran with a greater  fierceness, because he knew he would lose everything if he did not reach  his starting place before the sun went down. The sun was coming near the  rim of earth when he toiled up the last hill. His feet were cut by stones,  his face pinched with agony. He staggered toward the goal and fell across  it while as yet there was a glint of light. But his effort burst his heart.  Does the analogy hold on these narrow streets? To a few who sit in an inner  office, Mammon has made a promise of wealth and domination. These few run  breathless to gain a mountain. But what have the gods whispered to the ten  thousand who sit in the outer office, that they bend and blink upon their  ledgers? Have the gods whispered to them the promise of great wealth? Alas,  before them there lies only the dust and heat of a level road, yet they too  are broken at the sunset.    Less oppressive are the streets where commerce is more apparent. Here,  unless you would be smirched, it is necessary to walk fast and hold your  coat-tails in. Packing cases are going down slides. Bales are coming up in  hoists. Barrels are rolling out of wagons. Crates are being lifted in. Is  the exchange never to stop? Is no warehouse satisfied with what it has?  English, which until now you judged a soft concordant language, shows here  its range and mastery of epithet. And all about, moving and jostling the  boxes, are men with hooks. One might think that in a former day Captain  Cuttle had settled here to live and that his numerous progeny had kept the  place.    Often I ride on a bus top like a maharajah on an elephant, up near the  tusks, as it were, where the view is unbroken. I plan this trip so that I  move counter to the procession that goes uptown in the late afternoon. Is  there a scene like it in the world? The boulevards of Paris in times of  peace are hardly so gay. Fifth Avenue is blocked with motor cars. Fashion  has gone forth to select a feather. A ringlet has gone awry and must be  mended. The Pomeranian's health is served by sunlight. The Spitz must have  an airing. Fashion has wagged its head upon a Chinese vase--has indeed  squinted at it through a lorgnette against a fleck--and now lolls home to  dinner. Or style has veered an inch, and it has been a day of fitting. At  restaurant windows one may see the feeding of the over-fed.

I shall say, 'I did;' and then he'll  want to know how I saw the playground door from my bedroom window, which  looks out on the road; and then the fat'll be in the fire, and it'll all  come out about that supper.\"    Regularly every evening, as soon as supper was over, the two boys stole  down into the playground to set their trap; but when morning came there  was no sign of the shed having been entered.  This went on for nearly a  month, but still no result.    \"I don't think it's any good bothering about it any more,\" said Acton;  \"the thief doesn't mean to come again.\"    \"Well, we'll set it to-night,\" answered Diggory, \"and that shall be the  last time.\"    The following morning Acton was sauntering towards the playground, when  Diggory came running up the path in a state of great excitement.  \"I say, the cotton's gone!\"    Acton rushed down, unlocked the door of the shed, and went inside.    \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, as Diggory followed; \"_it is_ some man.  Look at  these footprints, and hobnailed boots into the bargain!\"        CHAPTER V.      CATCHING A TARTAR.    It was impossible for two boys to keep such an important discovery to  themselves, and the shed was soon filled with an eager crowd, all  anxious to view the mysterious footprints.  The Triple Alliance  gained fresh renown as the originators of the scheme by which the  disclosure had been made, and it was unanimously decided that the matter  should be reported to Mr. Blake.    The master cross-questioned Acton and Diggory, but seemed rather  inclined to doubt their story.    \"I think,\" he said, \"you must be mistaken.  I expect the piece of  cotton blew away, and the foot-marks must have been there before.  I don't see what there is in the shed that should make it worth any  one's while to break into it; besides, if the door was locked, the thief  must have broken it open, and you'd have seen the marks.\"    Certainly nothing seemed to have been touched, and as no boy complained  of any of his property having been stolen, the subject was allowed to  drop, and the usual excitement connected with the end of term and the  near approach of the holidays soon caused it to be driven from every  one's thoughts and wellnigh forgotten.    With the commencement of the winter term a fresh matter filled the minds  of the Triple Alliance, and gave them plenty of food for discussion and  plan-making.  On returning to Chatford after the summer holidays, they  discovered that all three were destined to leave at Christmas and  proceed to Ronleigh College, a large school in the neighbourhood, to  which a good number of Mr. Welsby's former pupils had been transferred  after undergoing a preliminary course of education at The Birches.  Letters from these departed heroes, containing disjointed descriptions  of their new surroundings, awakened a feeling of interest in the doings  of the Ronleigh College boys.  The records of their big scores at  cricket, or their victories at football, which appeared in local papers,  were always read with admiration; and the name of an old Birchite  appearing in either of the teams was a thing of which every one felt  justly proud.    \"I wish I was going too,\" said Acton, addressing the three friends;  \"but my people are going to send me to a school in Germany.  My brother  John is there; he's one of the big chaps, and is captain of the football  team this season.  I'm going to get the _Denfordshire Chronicle_ every  week, to see how they get on in the matches.\"    Early in October the goal-posts were put up in the field, and the  Birchites commenced their football practice.  Mr. Blake was a leading  member of the Chatford Town Club, and although six a side was  comparatively a poor business, yet under his instruction they gained a  good grounding in the rudiments of the \"soccer\" of the period.  The old  system of dribbling and headlong rushes was being abandoned in favour of  the passing game, and forwards were learning to keep their places, and  to play as a whole instead of as individuals.    \"Come here, you fellows,\" said the master, walking into the playground  one morning, with a piece of paper in his hand; \"I've got something to  speak about.\"    The boys crowded round, wondering what was up.    \"I've got here a challenge from Horace House to play a match against  them, either on our ground or on theirs.  I think it's a pity that you  shouldn't have an opportunity of playing against strangers.  Of course  they are bigger and heavier than we are, and we should probably get  licked; but that isn't the question: any sportsman would sooner play a  losing game than no game at all, and it'll be good practice.  We always  used to have a match with them every term; but some little time ago  there seemed to be a lack--well, I'll say of good sportsmen among them,  and the meetings had to be abandoned.  I've talked the matter over with  Mr. Welsby, and he seems willing to give the thing another trial.\"    An excited murmur ran through the crowd.    \"Wait a minute,\" interrupted the speaker, holding up his hand.  \"Mr. Welsby has left it with me to make arrangements for the match, and  I shall only do so on one condition.  I know that since the event  happened to which I referred a moment ago a decidedly unfriendly spirit  has existed between you and the boys at Mr. Phillips's.  Now an  exhibition of this feeling on a football field would be a disgrace to  the school.  You must play like gentlemen, and there must be no  wrangling or disputing.  They are agreeable for a master to play on each  side, so I shall act as captain.  Anything that has to be said must be  left to me, and I shall see you get fair play.  Do you clearly  understand?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very well, then, I'll write and say we shall be pleased to play them  here on Saturday week.\"    The prospect of mooting the Philistines in the open field filled the  mind of every boy with one thought, and the whole establishment went  football mad.  It  was played in the schoolroom and passages with empty  ink-pots and balls of paper, in the bedrooms with slippers and sponges,  and even in their dreams fellows kicked the bed-clothes off, and woke up  with cries of \"Goal!\" on their lips.    Mr. Blake arranged the order of the team, and remarking that they would  need a good defence, put himself and Shaw as full backs.  Acton took  centre forward, with Jack Vance on his right, while Diggory was told off  to keep goal.    At length the eventful morning arrived.  Class 2 came utterly to grief  in their work; but Mr. Blake understood the cause, and set the same  lessons over again for Monday.    It was the first real match most of the players had taken part in, and  as they stood on the ground waiting for their opponents to arrive, every  one was trembling with excitement.  The only exception was the  goal-keeper, who leaned with his back against the wall, cracking nuts,  and remarking that he \"wished they'd hurry up and not keep us waiting  all day.\"  At length there was a sound of voices in the lane, and  the next moment the enemy entered the field, headed by their  under-master, Mr. Fox.  Young Noaks and Hogson pounced down at once upon  the practice ball, and began kicking it about with great energy,  shouting at the top of their voices, and evidently wishing to make an  impression on the spectators before the game began.    \"I say,\" muttered Jacobs, \"they're awfully big.\"    \"Well, what does that matter?\" answered Diggory, cracking another nut  and spitting out the shell.  \"They aren't going to eat us; and as for  that chap Noaks, he's all noise--look how he muffed that kick.\"    Mr. Blake tossed up.  \"Now, you fellows,\" he said, coming up to his  followers, \"we play towards the road; get to your places, and remember  what I told you.\"    With young Noaks as centre forward, Hogson and Bernard on his right and  left, and other big fellows to complete the line of hostile forwards,  the home team seemed to stand no chance against their opponents.  The visitors bowled them over like ninepins, and rushed through their  first line of defence as though it never existed.  But Mr. Blake stood  firm, and kept his ground like the English squares at Waterloo.  Attack after attack swept down upon him only to break up like waves on a  rock, and the ball came flying back with a shout of \"Now, then!  Get  away, Birches!\"  Twice the Horace House wing men got round Shaw, and put  in good shots; but Diggory saved them both, and was seen a moment later  calmly rewarding himself with another nut.  Gradually, as the time  slipped away and no score was made, the Birchites began to realize that  being able to charge wasn't everything, and that their opponents could  do more with their shoulders than with their feet, and soon lost control  of the ball when bothered by the \"halves.\"  The play of the home eleven  became bolder--the forwards managed a run or two; and though the  Philistines had certainly the upper hand, yet it soon became obvious to  them that it was no mere \"walk over,\" and that victory would have to be  struggled for.    Noaks and the two inside forwards evidently did not relish this state of  things; they had expected an easy win, and began to show their  disappointment in the increased roughness of their play.    At length, just before half-time, a thing happened which very nearly  caused Mr. Blake's followers to break their promise.    Cross was badly kicked while attempting to take the ball from Hogson,  and had to retire from the game.    There were some black looks and a murmur of indignation among the home  team, but Mr. Blake hushed it up in a moment.    \"I think,\" he said"]]]
