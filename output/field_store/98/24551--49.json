But still at home they ruled themselves in peace,  By their own laws and ancient usages.  The emperor's only right was to adjudge  The penalty of death; he therefore named  Some mighty noble as his delegate,  That had no stake or interest in the land.  He was called in, when doom was to be passed,  And, in the face of day, pronounced decree,  Clear and distinctly, fearing no man's hate.  What traces here, that we are bondsmen? Speak,  If there be any can gainsay my words!    HOFE.  No! You have spoken but the simple truth;  We never stooped beneath a tyrant's yoke.    STAUFFACHER.  Even to the emperor we refused obedience,  When he gave judgment in the church's favor;  For when the Abbey of Einsiedlen claimed  The Alp our fathers and ourselves had grazed,  And showed an ancient charter, which bestowed  The land on them as being ownerless--  For our existence there had been concealed--  What was our answer? This: \"The grant is void,  No emperor can bestow what is our own:  And if the empire shall deny us justice,  We can, within our mountains, right ourselves!\"  Thus spake our fathers! And shall we endure  The shame and infamy of this new yoke,  And from the vassal brook what never king  Dared in the fulness of his power attempt?  This soil we have created for ourselves,  By the hard labor of our hands; we've changed  The giant forest, that was erst the haunt  Of savage bears, into a home for man;  Extirpated the dragon's brood, that wont  To rise, distent with venom, from the swamps;  Rent the thick misty canopy that hung  Its blighting vapors on the dreary waste;  Blasted the solid rock; o'er the abyss  Thrown the firm bridge for the wayfaring man  By the possession of a thousand years  The soil is ours. And shall an alien lord,  Himself a vassal, dare to venture here,  On our own hearths insult us,--and attempt  To forge the chains of bondage for our hands,  And do us shame on our own proper soil?  Is there no help against such wrong as this?       [Great sensation among the people.    Yes! there's a limit to the despot's power!  When the oppressed looks round in vain for justice,  When his sore burden may no more be borne,  With fearless heart he makes appeal to Heaven,  And thence brings down his everlasting rights,  Which there abide, inalienably his,  And indestructible as are the stars.  Nature's primeval state returns again,  Where man stands hostile to his fellow-man;  And if all other means shall fail his need,  One last resource remains--his own good sword.  Our dearest treasures call to us for aid  Against the oppressor's violence; we stand  For country, home, for wives, for children here!    ALL (clashing their swords).  Here stand we for our homes, our wives, and children.    ROSSELMANN (stepping into the circle).  Bethink ye well before ye draw the sword.  Some peaceful compromise may yet be made;  Speak but one word, and at your feet you'll see  The men who now oppress you. Take the terms  That have been often tendered you; renounce  The empire, and to Austria swear allegiance!    MAUER.  What says the priest? To Austria allegiance?    BUHEL.  Hearken not to him!    WINKELRLED.             'Tis a traitor's counsel,  His country's foe!    REDING.            Peace, peace, confederates!    SEWA.  Homage to Austria, after wrongs like these!    FLUE.  Shall Austria exert from us by force  What we denied to kindness and entreaty?    MEYER.  Then should we all be slaves, deservedly.    MAUER.  Yes! Let him forfeit all a Switzer's rights  Who talks of yielding to the yoke of Austria!  I stand on this, Landamman. Let this be  The foremost of our laws!    MELCHTHAL.                Even so! Whoever  Shall talk of tamely bearing Austria's yoke,  Let him be stripped of all his rights and honors;  And no man hence receive him at his hearth!    ALL (raising their right hands).  Agreed! Be this the law!    REDING (after a pause).                The law it is.    ROSSELMANN.  Now you are free--by this law you are free.  Never shall Austria obtain by force  What she has failed to gain by friendly suit.    WEILER.  On with the order of the day! Proceed!    REDING.  Confederates! Have all gentler means been tried?  Perchance the emperor knows not of our wrongs,  It may not be his will that thus we suffer:  Were it not well to make one last attempt,  And lay our grievances before the throne,  Ere we unsheath the sword? Force is at best  A fearful thing even in a righteous cause;  God only helps when man can help no more.    STAUFFACHER (to CONRAD HUNN).  Here you can give us information. Speak!    HUNN.  I was at Rheinfeld, at the emperor's palace,  Deputed by the Cantons to complain  Of the oppression of these governors,  And claim the charter of our ancient freedom,  Which each new king till now has ratified.  I found the envoys there of many a town,  From Suabia and the valley of the Rhine,  Who all received their parchments as they wished  And straight went home again with merry heart.  They sent for me, your envoy, to the council,  Where I was soon dismissed with empty comfort;  \"The emperor at present was engaged;  Some other time he would attend to us!\"  I turned away, and passing through the hall,  With heavy heart in a recess I saw  The Grand Duke John [18] in tears, and by his side  The noble lords of Wart and Tegerfeld,  Who beckoned me, and said, \"Redress yourselves.  Expect not justice from the emperor.  Does he not plunder his own brother's child,  And keep from him his just inheritance?\"  The duke claims his maternal property,  Urging he's now of age, and 'tis full time  That he should rule his people and dominions;  What is the answer made to him? The king  Places a chaplet on his head: \"Behold,  The fitting ornament,\" he cries, \"of youth!\"    MAUER.  You hear. Expect not from the emperor  Or right, or justice. Then redress yourselves!    REDING.  No other course is left us. Now, advise  What plan most likely to insure success.    FURST.  To shake a thraldom off that we abhor,  To keep our ancient rights inviolate,  As we received them from our forefathers--this,  Not lawless innovation, is our aim.  Let Caesar still retain what is his due;  And he that is a vassal let him pay  The service he is sworn to faithfully.    MEYER.  I hold my land of Austria in fief.    FURST.  Continue, then, to pay your feudal service.    WEILER.  I'm tenant of the lords of Rappersweil.    FURST.  Continue, then, to pay them rent and tithe.    ROSSELMANN.  Of Zurich's lady, I'm the humble vassal.    FURST.  Give to the cloister what the cloister claims.    STAUFFACHER.  The empire only is my feudal lord.    FURST.  What needs must be, we'll do, but nothing further.  We'll drive these tyrants and their minions hence,  And raze their towering strongholds to the ground,  Yet shed, if possible, no drop of blood.  Let the emperor see that we were driven to cast  The sacred duties of respect away;  And when he finds we keep within our bounds,  His wrath, belike, may yield to policy;  For truly is that nation to be feared,  That, when in arms, is temperate in its wrath.    REDING.  But, prithee, tell us how may this be done?  The enemy is armed as well as we,  And, rest assured, he will not yield in peace.    STAUFFACHER.  He will, whene'er he sees us up in arms;  We shall surprise him, ere he is prepared.    MEYER.  'Tis easily said, but not so easily done.  Two fortresses of strength command the country.  They shield the foe, and should the king invade us,  The task would then be dangerous indeed.  Rossberg and Sarnen both must be secured,  Before a sword is drawn in either Canton.    STAUFFACHER.  Should we delay, the foe will soon be warned;  We are too numerous for secrecy.    MEYER.  There is no traitor in the Forest States.    ROSSELMANN.  But even zeal may heedlessly betray.    FURST.  Delay it longer, and the keep at Altdorf  Will be complete,--the governor secure.    MEYER.  You think but of yourselves.    SACRISTAN.                  You are unjust!    MEYER.  Unjust! said you? Dares Uri taunt us so?    REDING.  Peace, on your oath!    MEYER.             If Schwytz be leagued with Uri,  Why then, indeed, we must perforce be silent.    REDING.  And let me tell you, in the Diet's name,  Your hasty spirit much disturbs the peace.  Stand we not all for the same common cause?    WINKELRIED.  What, if we delay till Christmas? 'Tis then  The custom for the serfs to throng the castle,  Bringing the governor their annual gifts.  Thus may some ten or twelve selected men  Assemble unobserved within its walls,  Bearing about their persons pikes of steel,  Which may be quickly mounted upon staves,  For arms are not admitted to the fort.  The rest can fill the neighboring wood, prepared  To sally forth upon a trumpet's blast,  Whene'er their comrades have secured the gate;  And thus the castle will be ours with ease.    MELCHTHAL.  The Rossberg I will undertake to scale,  I have a sweetheart in the garrison,  Whom with some tender words I could persuade  To lower me at night a hempen ladder.  Once up, my friends will not be long behind.    REDING.  Are all resolved in favor of delay?       [The majority raise their hands.    STAUFFACHER (counting them).  Twenty to twelve is the majority.    FURST.  If on the appointed day the castles fall,  From mountain on to mountain we shall pass  The fiery signal: in the capital  Of every Canton quickly rouse the Landsturm. [19]  Then, when these tyrants see our martial front,  Believe me, they will never make so bold  As risk the conflict, but will gladly take  Safe conduct forth beyond our boundaries.    STAUFFACHER.  Not so with Gessler. He will make a stand.  Surrounded with his dread array of horse,  Blood will he shed before he quits the field.  And even expelled he'd still be terrible.  'Tis hard, indeed 'tis dangerous, to spare him.    BAUMGARTEN.

God hath not planted rigor in the frame  Of woman; and the founders of this realm,  Who to the female hand have not denied  The reins of government, intend by this  To show that mercy, not severity,  Is the best virtue to adorn a crown.    ELIZABETH.  Lord Shrewsbury is a fervent advocate  For mine and England's enemy; I must  Prefer those counsellors who wish my welfare.    TALBOT.  Her advocates have an invidious task!  None will, by speaking in her favor, dare  To meet thy anger: stiffer, then, an old  And faithful counsellor (whom naught on earth  Can tempt on the grave's brink) to exercise  The pious duty of humanity.  It never shall be said that, in thy council,  Passion and interest could find a tongue,  While mercy's pleading voice alone was mute,  All circumstances have conspired against her;  Thou ne'er hast seen her face, and nothing speaks  Within thy breast for one that's stranger to thee.  I do not take the part of her misdeeds;  They say 'twas she who planned her husband's murder:  'Tis true that she espoused his murderer.  A grievous crime, no doubt; but then it happened  In darksome days of trouble and dismay,  In the stern agony of civil war,  When she, a woman, helpless and hemmed in  By a rude crowd of rebel vassals, sought  Protection in a powerful chieftain's arms.  God knows what arts were used to overcome her!  For woman is a weak and fragile thing.    ELIZABETH.  Woman's not weak; there are heroic souls  Among the sex; and, in my presence, sir,  I do forbid to speak of woman's weakness.    TALBOT.  Misfortune was for thee a rigid school;  Thou wast not stationed on the sunny side  Of life; thou sawest no throne, from far, before thee;  The grave was gaping for thee at thy feet.  At Woodstock, and in London's gloomy tower,  'Twas there the gracious father of this land  Taught thee to know thy duty, by misfortune.  No flatterer sought thee there: there learned thy soul,  Far from the noisy world and its distractions,  To commune with itself, to think apart,  And estimate the real goods of life.  No God protected this poor sufferer:  Transplanted in her early youth to France,  The court of levity and thoughtless joys,  There, in the round of constant dissipation,  She never heard the earnest voice of truth;  She was deluded by the glare of vice,  And driven onward by the stream of ruin.  Hers was the vain possession of a face,  And she outshone all others of her sex  As far in beauty, as in noble birth.    ELIZABETH.  Collect yourself, my Lord of Shrewsbury;  Bethink you we are met in solemn council.  Those charms must surely be without compare,  Which can engender, in an elder's blood,  Such fire. My Lord of Leicester, you alone  Are silent; does the subject which has made  Him eloquent, deprive you of your speech?    LEICESTER.  Amazement ties my tongue, my queen, to think  That they should fill thy soul with such alarms,  And that the idle tales, which, in the streets,  Of London, terrify the people's ears,  Should reach the enlightened circle of thy council,  And gravely occupy our statesmen's minds.  Astonishment possesses me, I own,  To think this lackland Queen of Scotland, she  Who could not save her own poor throne, the jest  Of her own vassals, and her country's refuse,  [Who in her fairest days of freedom, was  But thy despised puppet,] should become  At once thy terror when a prisoner.  What, in Heaven's name, can make her formidable?  That she lays claim to England? that the Guises  Will not acknowledge thee as queen?  [Did then Thy people's loyal fealty await  These Guises' approbation?] Can these Guises,  With their objections, ever shake the right  Which birth hath given thee; which, with one consent,  The votes of parliament have ratified?  And is not she, by Henry's will, passed o'er  In silence? Is it probable that England,  As yet so blessed in the new light's enjoyment,  Should throw itself into this papist's arms?  From thee, the sovereign it adores, desert  To Darnley's murderess? What will they then,  These restless men, who even in thy lifetime  Torment thee with a successor; who cannot  Dispose of thee in marriage soon enough  To rescue church and state from fancied peril?  Stand'st thou not blooming there in youthful prime  While each step leads her towards the expecting tomb?  By Heavens, I hope thou wilt full many a year  Walk o'er the Stuart's grave, and ne'er become  Thyself the instrument of her sad end.    BURLEIGH.  Lord Leicester hath not always held this tone.    LEICESTER.  'Tis true, I in the court of justice gave  My verdict for her death; here, in the council,  I may consistently speak otherwise  Here, right is not the question, but advantage.  Is this a time to fear her power, when France,  Her only succor, has abandoned her?  When thou preparest with thy hand to bless  The royal son of France, when the fair hope  Of a new, glorious stem of sovereigns  Begins again to blossom in this land?  Why hasten then her death? She's dead already.  Contempt and scorn are death to her; take heed  Lest ill-timed pity call her into life.  'Tis therefore my advice to leave the sentence,  By which her life is forfeit, in full force.  Let her live on; but let her live beneath  The headsman's axe, and, from the very hour  One arm is lifted for her, let it fall.    ELIZABETH (rises).  My lords, I now have heard your several thoughts,  And give my ardent thanks for this your zeal.  With God's assistance, who the hearts of kings  Illumines, I will weigh your arguments,  And choose what best my judgment shall approve.       [To BURLEIGH.    [Lord Burleigh's honest fears, I know it well,  Are but the offspring of his faithful care;  But yet, Lord Leicester has most truly said,  There is no need of haste; our enemy  Hath lost already her most dangerous sting--  The mighty arm of France: the fear that she  Might quickly be the victim of their zeal  Will curb the blind impatience of her friends.]         [1] The picture of Ate, the goddess of mischief, we are acquainted     with from Homer, II. v. 91, 130. I. 501. She is a daughter of     Jupiter, and eager to prejudice every one, even the immortal gods.     She counteracted Jupiter himself, on which account he seized her by     her beautiful hair, and hurled her from heaven to the earth, where     she now, striding over the heads of men, excites them to evil in     order to involve them in calamity.--HERDER.       Shakspeare has, in Julius Caesar, made a fine use of this image:--       \"And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge     with Ate by his side, come hot from hell,     Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,     Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\"       I need not point out to the reader the beautiful propriety of     introducing the evil spirit on this occasion.--TRANSLATOR.        SCENE IV.         Enter SIR AMIAS PAULET and MORTIMER.    ELIZABETH.  There's Sir Amias Paulet; noble sir,  What tidings bring you?    PAULET.               Gracious sovereign,  My nephew, who but lately is returned  From foreign travel, kneels before thy feet,  And offers thee his first and earliest homage,  Grant him thy royal grace, and let him grow  And flourish in the sunshine of thy favor.    MORTIMER (kneeling on one knee).  Long live my royal mistress! Happiness  And glory from a crown to grace her brows!    ELIZABETH.  Arise, sir knight; and welcome here in England;  You've made, I hear, the tour, have been in France  And Rome, and tarried, too, some time at Rheims:  Tell me what plots our enemies are hatching?    MORTIMER.  May God confound them all! And may the darts  Which they shall aim against my sovereign,  Recoiling, strike their own perfidious breasts!    ELIZABETH.  Did you see Morgan, and the wily Bishop  Of Ross?      MORTIMER.       I saw, my queen, all Scottish exiles  Who forge at Rheims their plots against this realm.  I stole into their confidence in hopes  To learn some hint of their conspiracies.    PAULET.  Private despatches they intrusted to him,  In cyphers, for the Queen of Scots, which he,  With loyal hand, hath given up to us.    ELIZABETH.  Say, what are then their latest plans of treason?    MORTIMER.  It struck them all as 'twere a thunderbolt,  That France should leave them, and with England close  This firm alliance; now they turn their hopes  Towards Spain----    ELIZABETH.           This, Walsingham hath written us.    MORTIMER.  Besides, a bull, which from the Vatican  Pope Sixtus lately levelled at thy throne,  Arrived at Rheims, as I was leaving it;  With the next ship we may expect it here.    LEICESTER.  England no more is frightened by such arms.    BURLEIGH.  They're always dangerous in bigots' hands.    ELIZABETH (looking steadfastly at MORTIMER).  Your enemies have said that you frequented  The schools at Rheims, and have abjured your faith.    MORTIMER.  So I pretended, that I must confess;  Such was my anxious wish to serve my queen.    ELIZABETH (to PAULET, who presents papers to her).  What have you there?    PAULET.             'Tis from the Queen of Scots.  'Tis a petition, and to thee addressed.    BURLEIGH (hastily catching at it).  Give me the paper.    PAULET (giving it to the QUEEN).            By your leave, my lord  High-treasurer; the lady ordered me  To bring it to her majesty's own hands.  She says I am her enemy; I am  The enemy of her offences only,  And that which is consistent with my duty  I will, and readily, oblige her in.    [The QUEEN takes the letter: as she reads it MORTIMER     and LEICESTER speak some words in private.    BURLEIGH (to PAULET)"]]]
