Prayers were read to the men, and the cattle  and party rested. The day was cool and cloudy.    12TH JANUARY.--Still I halted at Muda for the lost bullocks. To-day I  noticed the KOCHIA BREVIFOLIA, a little salt-bush, with greenish yellow  fruit, edged with pink.    13TH JANUARY.--Baldock and Yuranigh arrived early in the morning (by  moonlight) with five of the stray bullocks. Two others (young ones) could  not be driven along, and one old bullock was still astray at Mr. Kerr's  station (to which they had returned) and could not even then be found. We  had now in all 106 bullocks, and, considering the great scarcity of  water, heat, and consequent drought, I was most thankful that our loss  had been so slight.    I proceeded to reconnoitre the country in a straight line towards  Nyingan, which bore 353 deg.--and having found a tolerably open country for  about six miles, I returned and took the party on so far, and encamped,  sending back all the cattle and horses to the water at Muda. Enough had  been carried forward for the men who were to remain at the camp. To  ensure the early return of the cattle, I had repaired, as already stated,  the paddock at Muda, in which during this night, they could be secured,  having also sufficient grass,--likewise the horses. In my ride I found a  new grass of the genus CHLORIS[*], something like CHL. TRUNCATA in habit,  some starved specimens of TRICHINIUM LANATUM; amongst the grasses I also  found the ARISTIDA CALYCINA of Brown, the curious NEURACHNE MITCHELLIANA  Nees, discovered originally by me in 1836, and also a new PAPPOPHORUM  with the aspect of our European Anthoxanthum.[**] A smart shower fell  during the evening.    [* C. ACICULARIS (Lindl. MS.); culmo stricto, foliis involutis glabris  tactu scabris, spicis 8--9 subacutis, spiculis bifloris, flore utroque  setaceo aristato, supremo sterili angustissimo, paleis dorso scabris.]    [** P. FLAVESCENS (Lindl. MS.); aristis 9 rigidis pallidis plumosis,  spica composita densissima oblonga, paleis lanatis, glumis ovatis  pilosis, foliis vaginisque pubescentibus tactu scabris, geniculis  villosis.]    14TH JANUARY.--The cattle arrived early from Muda, and were immediately  yoked to the drays. I proceeded with the light carts, still on the same  bearing, until arriving near Dar, where I had formerly been encamped, I  turned to the left to ascertain if there really was no water there. I  found two excellent ponds, and encamped beside them after a journey of  about ten miles. The drays arrived early and I subsequently found I had  encamped near my old ground of 9th May, 1835, when I was guided by the  friendly chief of the Bogan tribe to the best water holes his country  afforded. By the route I had selected from my former surveys, I had cut  off the great bend described by the Bogan in changing from a north-  westerly to a northerly course, and the track now left by our wheels will  probably continue to be used as a road, when the banks of the Bogan may  be again occupied by the colonists. At Darwere still most substantial  stock-yards, and, as usual, the deep dug foundations of a dairy that had  been burnt down.    15TH JANUARY.--Eight bullocks were missing, and although the day was  fine, not too hot, I could not think of moving until these cattle were  found. Accordingly, at earliest dawn, I despatched William Baldock and  the native to look for them. In the course of the day six were found by  Baldock in one direction, and the remaining two, afterwards, in another.  An inconspicuous blue-flowered Erigeron grew here, also the JASMINUM  LINEARE, with its sweet-scented white flowers--and, near the water, I saw  the ALTERNANTHERA NODIFLORA.    16TH JANUARY.--At a good early hour the party moved from Dar, crossing  the Bogan and falling into my former track and line of marked trees. We  lost these, however, on crossing the Bogan at Murgaba, and made a slight  detour to the eastward before we found Nyingan, where we encamped, and  were joined by the drays by twelve o'clock. During this day's journey  Piper and Yuranigh discovered fresh traces of horsemen with those of the  feet of a native guide, come from the East to my old track, and  returning, apparently, as our natives thought, looking for traces of our  party.    At Nyingan we found many recent huts and other indications of the  natives, but saw none. Large stock-yards and a paddock remained, but a  house and garden fences had been burnt down. The great ponds were sunken  very low and covered with aquatic weeds. As soon as the camp had been  established with the usual attention to defence, I set out to look for  the next water, and after riding twelve miles nearly in the direction of  my former route, I reached the dry channel of the Bogan, and tracing it  thence upwards, I sought in every hollow at all its turnings for water,  but in vain, and I reached the camp only at dusk, without having seen,  during the day, any other ponds than those of Nyingan.    17TH JANUARY.--Early this morning, I sent Mr. Kennedy with the native  Yuranigh, also on horseback, to run back my track of yesterday to the  Bogan where I had commenced its examination upwards, and from that point  to examine the channel downwards to the nearest water, provided this did  not take Mr. Kennedy too far to admit of his return by sunset. Two old  women came to the ponds of Nyingan for water, by whom Piper was told that  the nearest permanent water was \"NIMINE,\" where white men had attempted  to form a cattle-station, and been prevented by natives from the Darling,  many of whom had since been shot by the white men. They said the place  was far beyond Canbelego, the next stage of my former journey, and where  these women also said little or no water remained.    Mr. Kennedy returned at eleven A.M., having found water at Canbelego.  Yuranigh brought with him a large green specimen of the fruit of the  CAPPARIS MITCHELLII, which he called an apple, being new to him, but  which Dicky, the younger native from the Lower Bogan, knew, and said was  called \"MOGUILE;\" he also said that it was eaten by the natives.    18TH JANUARY.--The party moved to Canbelego where one or two small ponds  remained, but on the plains adjacent there was better grass than we had  hitherto found near those places where, for the sake of water, we had  been obliged to encamp. I sent Mr. Kennedy again forward looking for  water, but he returned sooner than I expected, and after following the  river down twelve miles, without finding any. I was now within the same  distance of Duck Creek, in which Mr. Larmer had found abundance of water  when I sent him to survey it upwards during my last return journey up the  Bogan. It also seemed, from the direction in which Piper pointed, that  the old gins referred to Duck Creek, as containing water; and as the  course of that creek, so far as shown on maps, led even more directly to  the Darling than did the Bogan, I was willing in such a season of extreme  drought, to avail myself of its waters. My eye had been much injured by  straining at stars while at the camp near Walwadyer, and I was obliged to  send Mr. Kennedy on one of my own horses, followed by Graham, to examine  the water in Duck Creek. I instructed him to proceed on a bearing of 35 deg.  E. of North, until he should reach the creek, and if he found water in it  to return direct to the camp, but that if water was not found on first  making the creek, then he was to follow Duck Creek up to its junction  with an eastern branch, surveyed also by Mr. Larmer, and to return thence  to the camp on a bearing of 240 deg.. I also sent Corporal Macavoy with  Yuranigh down the Bogan, to ascertain if the channel contained any pond  between our camp and the part previously examined by Mr. Kennedy.    This officer returned from Duck Creek after an absence of twelve hours,  and reported that he had found no water in Duck Creek after examining its  bed twelve miles; but that he had found a fine lagoon on the plains near  the head of the eastern branch, but around which there was no grass, all  having been recently burnt.    20TH JANUARY.--Macavoy returned at seven A.M., saying he had been twenty-  four miles down the Bogan without finding any water. About the same time  Sergeant Niblett, in charge of the bullocks, came to inform me that these  animals were looking very ill, and could not drink the mud remaining in  the pond. At the same time intelligence was brought me that four of the  horses had broken their tether ropes during the night, and that William  Baldock had been absent in search of them on foot, from an early hour in  the morning. I immediately sent back the whole of the bullocks to  Nyingan, with a dray containing the empty harness casks, also the horses,  and a cart carrying all our other empty casks; and the whole of the  cattle and horses returned in the evening with all the casks filled.    21ST JANUARY.--Having again despatched the bullocks back to Nyingan, I  conducted the light carts forward along my old track (of 1835), having on  two of these carts two of the half-boats, and in the carts under them all  the water-kegs that had been filled. My object was to use the iron boat  as a tank, at which we might water the bullocks at one stage forward;  that by so gaining that point and proceeding onwards towards the water I  hoped to find next day, we might encamp at least at such a convenient  distance from it, as would admit of the cattle being driven forward to  return next day and draw the drays to it. This I considered possible,  even if it might be found necessary to go as far for water as the fine  reach described in my journal as the place of my encampment on the 14th  May, 1835, beyond Mount Hopeless, and which I concluded from the gin's  description, must have been what she called Nimine, or the disputed  station of Lee. I encamped this party on a plain about twelve miles from  Canbelego, where I had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9963"],[0,"Elsie's Girlhood (#8)"],[1,"being, scarcely formed or moulded,    A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.      --BYRON.      Elsie was nearly twelve when her little brother was born. During the  next three years she led a life of quiet happiness, unmarked by any  striking event. There were no changes in the little family at the Oaks  but such as time must bring to all. Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore perhaps  looked a trifle older than when they married, Elsie was budding into  womanhood as fair and sweet a flower as ever was seen, and the baby  had grown into a healthy romping boy.    At Roselands, on the contrary, there had been many and important  changes. Louise and Lora were both married; the former to a resident  of another State, who had taken her to his distant home; the latter to  Edward Howard, an older brother of Elsie's friend Carrie. They had not  left the neighborhood, but were residing with his parents.    For the last two or three years Arthur Dinsmore had spent his  vacations at home; he was doing so now, having just completed his  freshman year at Princeton. On his return Walter was to accompany him  and begin his college career.    Miss Day left soon after Lora's marriage and no effort had been made  to fill her place, Adelaide having undertaken to act as governess to  Enna, now the only remaining occupant of the school-room.    Taking advantage of an unusually cool breezy afternoon, Elsie rode  over to Tinegrove, Mr. Howard's plantation--to make a call. She found  the family at home and was urged to stay to tea; but declined, saying  she could not without permission, and had not asked it.    \"You will at least take off your hat,\" said Carrie.    \"No, thank you,\" Elsie answered, \"it is not worth while, as I must go  so soon. If you will excuse me, I can talk quite as well with it on.\"    They had not met for several weeks and found a good deal to say to  each other. At length Elsie drew out her watch.    \"Ah!\" she exclaimed, \"I have overstayed my time! I had no idea it was  so late--you have been so entertaining; but I must go now.\" And she  rose hastily to take leave.    \"Nonsense!\" said her Aunt Lora in whose boudoir they were sitting,  \"there is no such great hurry, I am sure. You'll get home long before  dark.\"    \"Yes, and might just as well stay another five or ten minutes. I wish  you would; for I have ever so much to say to you,\" urged Carrie.    \"It would be very pleasant, thank you, but indeed I must not. See how  the shadows are lengthening, and papa does not at all like to have me  out after sunset unless he is with me.\"    \"He always was overcareful of you, erring on the right side, I  suppose, if that be an allowable expression,\" laughed Lora, as she and  Carrie followed Elsie to the door to see her mount her horse.    The adieus were quickly spoken and the young girl, just touching the  whip to the sleek side of her pony, set off at a gallop, closely  followed by her faithful attendant Jim.    Several miles of rather a lonely road lay between them and home, and  no time was to be lost, if they would reach the Oaks while the sun was  still above the horizon.    They were hardly more than half a mile from the entrance to the  grounds, when Elsie caught sight of a well-known form slowly moving  down the road a few paces ahead of them. It was Arthur, and she soon  perceived that it was his intention to intercept her; he stopped,  turning his face toward her, sprang forward as she came up, and seized  her bridle.    \"Stay a moment, Elsie,\" he said, \"I want to speak to you.\"    \"Then come on to the Oaks, and let us talk there; please do, for I am  in a hurry.\"    \"No, I prefer to say my say where I am. I'll not detain you long. You  keep out of earshot, Jim. I want to borrow a little money, Elsie; a  trifle of fifty dollars or so. Can you accommodate me?\"    \"Not without papa's knowledge, Arthur. So I hope you do not wish to  conceal the matter from him.\"    \"I do. I see no reason why he should know all my private affairs.  Can't you raise that much without applying to him? Isn't your  allowance very large now?\"    \"Fifty dollars a month, Arthur, but subject to the same conditions as  of old. I must account to papa for every cent.\"    \"Haven't you more than that in hand now?\"    \"Yes, but what do you want it for?\"    \"That's neither your business nor his; let me have it for two weeks,  I'll pay it back then, and in the meantime he need know nothing about  it.\"    \"I cannot; I never have any concealments from papa, and I must give in  my account in less than a week.\"    \"Nonsense! You are and always were the most disobliging creature  alive!\" returned Arthur with an oath.    \"Oh, Arthur, how can you say such wicked words,\" she said, recoiling  from him with a shudder. \"And you quite misjudge me. I would be glad  to do anything for you that is right. If you will let me tell papa  your wish, and he gives consent, you shall have the money at once. Now  please let me go. The sun has set and I shall be so late that papa  will be anxious and much displeased.\"    \"Who cares if he is!\" he answered roughly, still retaining his hold  upon her bridle, and compelling her to listen while he continued to  urge his request; enforcing it with arguments and threats.    They were alike vain, she steadfastly refused to grant it except on  the conditions she had named, and which he determinately rejected--and  insisted being left free to pursue her homeward way.    He grew furious, and at length with a shocking oath released her  bridle, but at the same instant struck her pony a severe blow upon his  haunches, with a stout stick he held in his hand.    The terrified animal, smarting with the pain, started aside, reared  and plunged in a way that would have unseated a less skilful rider,  and had nearly thrown Elsie from the saddle: then darted off at the  top of its speed; but fortunately turned in at the gate held open by  Jim, who had ridden on ahead and dismounted for that purpose.    \"Whoa, you Glossy! whoa dere!\" he cried, springing to the head of the  excited animal, and catching its bridle in his powerful grasp.    \"Just lead her for a little, Jim,\" said Elsie \"There, there! my poor  pretty Glossy, be quiet now. It was too cruel to serve you so; but  it shan't happen again if your mistress can help it,\" she added in a  voice tremulous with sympathy and indignation, patting and stroking  her pony caressingly as she spoke.    Jim obeyed, walking on at a brisk pace, leading Glossy with his right  hand, and keeping the bridle of the other horse over his left arm.    \"I'll walk the rest of the way, Jim,\" said Elsie presently, \"just stop  her and let me get down. There,\" springing lightly to the ground, \"you  may lead them both to the stable now.\"    She hurried forward along the broad, gravelled winding carriage road  that led to the house. The next turn brought her face to face with her  father.    \"What, Elsie! alone and on foot at this late hour?\" he said in a tone  of mingled surprise and reproof.    \"I have been riding, papa, and only a moment since dismounted and let  Jim lead the horses down the other road to the stables.\"    \"Ah, but how did you come to be so late?\" he asked, drawing her hand  within his arm and leading her onward.    \"I have been to Tinegrove, sir, and Aunt Lora, Carrie, and I found so  much to say to each other, that the time slipped away before I knew  it.\"    \"It must not happen again, Elsie.\"    \"I do not mean it shall, papa, and I am very sorry.\"    \"Then I excuse you this once, daughter; it is not often you give me  occasion to reprove you.\"    \"Thank you, papa,\" she said with a grateful, loving look. \"Did you  come out in search of me?\"    \"Yes, your mamma and I had begun to grow anxious lest some accident  had befallen you. Our little daughter is such a precious treasure that  we must needs watch over her very carefully,\" he added in a tone that  was half playful, half tender, while he pressed the little gloved  hand in his, and his eyes rested upon the sweet fair face with an  expression of proud fatherly affection.    Her answering look was full of filial reverence and love. \"Dear papa,  it is so nice to be so loved and cared for; so sweet to hear such  words from your lips. I do believe I'm the very happiest girl in the  land.\" She had already almost forgotten Arthur and his rudeness and  brutality.    \"And I the happiest father,\" he said with a pleased smile. \"Ah, here  comes mamma to meet as with little Horace.\"    The child ran forward with a glad shout to meet his sister, Rose met  her with loving words and a fond caress; one might have thought from  their joyous welcome, that she was returning after an absence of  weeks or months instead of hours. Letting go her father's arm as they  stepped upon the piazza Elsie began a romping play with her little  brother, but at a gentle reminder from her mamma that the tea bell  would soon ring, ran away to her own apartments to have her riding  habit changed for something more suitable for the drawing room.    Chloe was in waiting and her skilful hands made rapid work, putting  the last touches to her nursling's dress just as the summons to the  supper table was given.    Mr. Dinsmore was quite as fastidious as in former days in regard to  the neatness and tastefulness of Elsie's attire.    \"Will I do, papa?\" she asked, presenting herself before him, looking  very sweet and fair in a simple white dress with blue sash and  ribbons.    \"Yes,\" he said with a satisfied smile, \"I see nothing amiss with  dress, hair, or face.\"    \"Nor do I,\" said Rose, leading the way to the supper room, \"Aunt Chloe  is an accomplished tirewoman. But come, let us sit down to our meal  and have it over.\"    On their return to the drawing room they, found Mr. Travilla  comfortably ensconced in an easy chair, reading the evening paper. He  was an almost daily visitor at the Oaks, and seldom came without some  little gift for one or both of his friend's children. It was for"]]]
