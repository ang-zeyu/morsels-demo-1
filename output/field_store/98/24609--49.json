and the priest             shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in             the leper;    03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be             cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and             scarlet, and hyssop:    03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed             in an earthen vessel over running water:    03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,             and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the             living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the             running water:    03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the             leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall             let the living bird loose into the open field.    03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and             shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may             be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and             shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.    03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all             his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all             his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,             also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.    03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without             blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,             and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,             mingled with oil, and one log of oil.    03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man             that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,             at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:    03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a             trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a             wave offering before the LORD:    03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill             the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:             for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass             offering: it is most holy:    03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass             offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the             right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of             his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:    03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it             into the palm of his own left hand:    03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is             in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his             finger seven times before the LORD:    03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the             priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be             cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the             great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass             offering:    03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he             shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and             the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.    03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an             atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;

   03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,             and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:             and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be             cleansed before the LORD.    03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose             hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his             cleansing.    03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,    03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you             for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house             of the land of your possession;

   03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the             house, and shut up the house seven days:    03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall             look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the             house;    03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones             in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an             unclean place without the city:    03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,             and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without             the city into an unclean place:    03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of             those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall             plaister the house.    03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,             after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath             scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;    03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the             plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the             house; it is unclean.    03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the             timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall             carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.    03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is             shut up shall be unclean until the even.    03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he             that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.    03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,             behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the             house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the             house clean, because the plague is healed.    03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar             wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:    03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel             over running water:    03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the             scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the             slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house             seven times:    03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8010"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 10: 2 Samuel (#8)"],[1," thy servants set my field on fire?    10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,             Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,             Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to             have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's             face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.    10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called             for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his             face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed             Absalom.    10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him             chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.    10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the             gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy             came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,             and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is             of one of the tribes of Israel.    10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and             right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.    10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,             that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto             me, and I would do him justice!    10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him             obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed             him.    10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the             king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of             Israel.    10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto             the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have             vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.    10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,             saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,             then I will serve the LORD.    10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went             to Hebron.    10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,             saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye             shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.    10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that             were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew             not any thing.    10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's             counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered             sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people             increased continually with Absalom.    10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the             men of Israel are after Absalom.    10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at             Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else             escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us             suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the             edge of the sword.    10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy             servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall             appoint.    10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And             the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the             house.    10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and             tarried in a place that was far off.    10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the             Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six             hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before             the king.    10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou             also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:             for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.    10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee             go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return             thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with             thee.    10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and             as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the             king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will             thy servant be.    10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the             Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones             that were with him.    10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people             passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook             Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the             wilderness.    10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing             the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of             God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done             passing out of the city.    10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into             the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he             will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:    10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am             I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.    10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?             return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,             Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.    10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there             come word from you to certify me.    10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to             Jerusalem: and they tarried there.    10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as             he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:             and all the people that was with him covered every man his             head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.    10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the             conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray             thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.    10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of             the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite             came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:    10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou             shalt be a burden unto me:    10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will             be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant             hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou             for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.    10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the             priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou             shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to             Zadok and Abiathar the priests.    10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz             Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall             send unto me every thing that ye can hear.    10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came             into Jerusalem.    10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,             Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of             asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and             an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer             fruits, and a bottle of wine.    10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And             Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;             and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and             the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.    10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba             said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he             said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom             of my father.    10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that             pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech             thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.    10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a             man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,             the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.    10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king             David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his             right hand and on his left.    10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou             bloody man, and thou man of Belial:    10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of             Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath             delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,             behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a             bloody man.    10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should             this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray             thee, and take off his head.    10:016:010 And"]]]
