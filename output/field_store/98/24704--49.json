You make noise enough to wake folk in Moonfleet from their beds.'    'Tut, man,' retorted Ratsey testily, 'and if they waked, they would but  pull the blankets tight about their ears, and say 'twas Blackbeard piping  his crew of lost Mohunes to help him dig for treasure.'    Yet for all that 'twas plain that Block ruled the roost, for there was  silence for a minute, and then one said, 'Ay, Master Elzevir is right;  let us away, the night is far spent, and we have nothing but the sweeps  to take the lugger out of sight by dawn.'    So the meeting broke up, and the torchlight grew dimmer, and died away  as it had come in a red flicker on the roof, and the footsteps sounded  fainter as they went up the passage, until the vault was left to the dead  men and me. Yet for a very long time--it seemed hours--after all had gone  I could hear a murmur of distant voices, and knew that some were talking  at the end of the passage, and perhaps considering how the landslip might  best be restored. So while I heard them thus conversing I dared not  descend from my perch, lest someone might turn back to the vault, though  I was glad enough to sit up, and ease my aching back and limbs. Yet in  the awful blackness of the place even the echo of these human voices  seemed a kindly and blessed thing, and a certain shrinking loneliness  fell on me when they ceased at last and all was silent. Then I resolved I  would be off at once, and get back to the moonlight bed that I had left  hours ago, having no stomach for more treasure-hunting, and being glad  indeed to be still left with the treasure of life.    Thus, sitting where I was, I lit my candle once more, and then clambered  across that great coffin which, for two hours or more, had been a  mid-wall of partition between me and danger. But to get out of the niche  was harder than to get in; for now that I had a candle to light me, I saw  that the coffin, though sound enough to outer view, was wormed through  and through, and little better than a rotten shell. So it was that I had  some ado to get over it, not daring either to kneel upon it or to bring  much weight to bear with my hand, lest it should go through. And now  having got safely across, I sat for an instant on that narrow ledge of  the stone shelf which projected beyond the coffin on the vault side, and  made ready to jump forward on to the floor below. And how it happened I  know not, but there I lost my balance, and as I slipped the candle flew  out of my grasp. Then I clutched at the coffin to save myself, but my  hand went clean through it, and so I came to the ground in a cloud of  dust and splinters; having only got hold of a wisp of seaweed, or a  handful of those draggled funeral trappings which were strewn about this  place. The floor of the vault was sandy; and so, though I fell crookedly,  I took but little harm beyond a shaking; and soon, pulling myself  together, set to strike my flint and blow the match into a flame to  search for the fallen candle. Yet all the time I kept in my fingers this  handful of light stuff; and when the flame burnt up again I held the  thing against the light, and saw that it was no wisp of seaweed, but  something black and wiry. For a moment, I could not gather what I had  hold of, but then gave a start that nearly sent the candle out, and  perhaps a cry, and let it drop as if it were red-hot iron, for I knew  that it was a man's beard.    Now when I saw that, I felt a sort of throttling fright, as though one  had caught hold of my heartstrings; and so many and such strange thoughts  rose in me, that the blood went pounding round and round in my head, as  it did once afterwards when I was fighting with the sea and near drowned.  Surely to have in hand the beard of any dead man in any place was bad  enough, but worse a thousand times in such a place as this, and to know  on whose face it had grown. For, almost before I fully saw what it was, I  knew it was that black beard which had given Colonel John Mohune his  nickname, and this was his great coffin I had hid behind.    I had lain, therefore, all that time, cheek by jowl with Blackbeard  himself, with only a thin shell of tinder wood to keep him from me, and  now had thrust my hand into his coffin and plucked away his beard. So  that if ever wicked men have power to show themselves after death, and  still to work evil, one would guess that he would show himself now and  fall upon me. Thus a sick dread got hold of me, and had I been a woman  or a girl I think I should have swooned; but being only a boy, and not  knowing how to swoon, did the next best thing, which was to put myself as  far as might be from the beard, and make for the outlet. Yet had I scarce  set foot in the passage when I stopped, remembering how once already this  same evening I had played the coward, and run home scared with my own  fears. So I was brought up for very shame, and beside that thought how I  had come to this place to look for Blackbeard's treasure, and might have  gone away without knowing even so much as where he lay, had not chance  first led me to be down by his side, and afterwards placed my hand upon  his beard. And surely this could not be chance alone, but must rather be  the finger of Providence guiding me to that which I desired to find. This  consideration somewhat restored my courage, and after several feints to  return, advances, stoppings, and panics, I was in the vault again,  walking carefully round the stack of barrels, and fearing to see the  glimmer of the candle fall upon that beard. There it was upon the sand,  and holding the candle nearer to it with a certain caution, as though it  would spring up and bite me, I saw it was a great full black beard, more  than a foot long, but going grey at the tips; and had at the back,  keeping it together, a thin tissue of dried skin, like the false parting  which Aunt Jane wore under her cap on Sundays. This I could see as it lay  before me, for I did not handle or lift it, but only peered into it, with  the candle, on all sides, busying myself the while with thoughts of the  man of whom it had once been part.    In returning to the vault, I had no very sure purpose in mind; only a  vague surmise that this finding of Blackbeard's coffin would somehow lead  to the finding of his treasure. But as I looked at the beard and  pondered, I began to see that if anything was to be done, it must be by  searching in the coffin itself, and the clearer this became to me, the  greater was my dislike to set about such a task. So I put off the evil  hour, by feigning to myself that it was necessary to make a careful  scrutiny of the beard, and thus wasted at least ten minutes. But at  length, seeing that the candle was burning low, and could certainly last  little more than half an hour, and considering that it must now be  getting near dawn, I buckled to the distasteful work of rummaging the  coffin. Nor had I any need to climb up on to the top shelf again, but  standing on the one beneath, found my head and arms well on a level with  the search. And beside that, the task was not so difficult as I had  thought; for in my fall I had broken off the head-end of the lid, and  brought away the whole of that side that faced the vault. Now, any lad of  my age, and perhaps some men too, might well have been frightened to set  about such a matter as to search in a coffin; and if any had said, a few  hours before, that I should ever have courage to do this by night in the  Mohune vault, I would not have believed him. Yet here I was, and had  advanced along the path of terror so gradually, and as it were foot by  foot in the past night, that when I came to this final step I was not  near so scared as when I first felt my way into the vault. It was not the  first time either that I had looked on death; but had, indeed, always a  leaning to such sights and matters, and had seen corpses washed up from  the _Darius_ and other wrecks, and besides that had helped Ratsey to case  some poor bodies that had died in their beds.    The coffin was, as I have said, of great length, and the side being  removed, I could see the whole outline of the skeleton that lay in it. I  say the outline, for the form was wrapped in a woollen or flannel shroud,  so that the bones themselves were not visible. The man that lay in it was  little short of a giant, measuring, as I guessed, a full six and a half  feet, and the flannel having sunk in over the belly, the end of the  breast-bone, the hips, knees, and toes were very easy to be made out. The  head was swathed in linen bands that had been white, but were now stained  and discoloured with damp, but of this I shall not speak more, and  beneath the chin-cloth the beard had once escaped. The clutch which I had  made to save myself in falling had torn away this chin-band and let the  lower jaw drop on the breast; but little else was disturbed, and there  was Colonel John Mohune resting as he had been laid out a century ago. I  lifted that portion of the lid which had been left behind, and reached  over to see if there was anything hid on the other side of the body; but  had scarce let the light fall in the coffin when my heart gave a great  bound, and all fear left me in the flush of success, for there I saw what  I had come to seek.    On the breast of this silent and swathed figure lay a locket, attached to  the neck by a thin chain, which passed inside the linen bandages. A  whiter portion of the flannel showed how far the beard had extended, but  locket and chain were quite black, though I judged that they were made of  silver. The shape of this locket was not unlike a crown-piece, only three  times as thick, and as soon as I set eyes upon it I never doubted but  that inside would be found the diamond.    It was then that a great pity came over me for this thin shadow of man;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#9)"],[1,"yonder knight is  none other than the great Sir Launcelot of the Lake, concerning whom there  is now such report; for he is reputed to be the most powerful of all the  knights of King Arthur's Round Table, and the greatest knight in the world,  so that King Arthur loves him and favors him above all other knights.\"    Now when Queen Morgana le Fay was aware that the knight who was asleep  there was Sir Launcelot, it immediately entered her mind for to lay some  powerful, malignant enchantment upon him to despite King Arthur. For she  too knew how dear Sir Launcelot was to King Arthur, and so she had a mind  to do him mischief for King Arthur's sake. So she went softly to where Sir  Launcelot lay with intent to work some such spell upon him. But when she  had come to Sir Launcelot she was aware that this purpose of mischief was  not possible whilst he wore that ring upon his finger which the Lady of the  Lake had given him; wherefore she had to put by her evil design for a  while.    [Sidenote: Queen Morgana le Fay sets a mild enchantment upon Sir  Launcelot] But though she was unable to work any malign spell upon him,  she was able to cause it by her magic that that sleep in which he lay  should remain unbroken for three or four hours. So she made certain  movements of her hands above his face and by that means she wove the  threads of his slumber so closely together that he could not break through  them to awake.    After she had done this she called to her several of the esquires who were  of her party, and these at her command fetched the shield of Sir Launcelot  and laid him upon it. Then they lifted him and bore him away, carrying him  in that manner to a certain castle in the forest that was no great distance  away. And the name of that castle was Chateaubras and it was one of Queen  Morgana's castles.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot awakens in a fair chamber] And all that while Sir  Launcelot wist nothing, but lay in a profound sleep, so that when he awoke  and looked about him he was so greatly astonished that he knew not whether  he was in a vision or whether he was awake. For whilst he had gone asleep  beneath that apple-tree, here he now lay in a fair chamber upon a couch  spread with a coverlet of flame-colored linen.    Then he perceived that it was a very fair room in which he lay, for it was  hung all about with tapestry hangings representing fair ladies at court and  knights at battle. And there were woven carpets upon the floor, and the  couch whereon he lay was of carved wood, richly gilt. There were two  windows to that chamber, and when he looked forth he perceived that the  chamber where he was was very high from the ground, being built so loftily  upon the rugged rocks at its foot that the forest lay far away beneath him  like a sea of green. And he perceived that there was but one door to this  chamber and that the door was bound with iron and studded with great bosses  of wrought iron, and when he tried that door he found that it was locked.    So Sir Launcelot was aware from these things that he was a prisoner--though  not a prisoner in a hard case--and he wist not how he had come thither nor  what had happened to him.    [Sidenote: A fair damsel beareth light and food unto Sir Launcelot] Now  when the twilight of the evening had fallen, a porter, huge of frame and  very forbidding of aspect, came and opened the door of the chamber where  Sir Launcelot lay, and when he had done so there entered a fair damsel,  bearing a very good supper upon a silver tray. Moreover, she bore upon the  tray three tapers of perfumed wax set in three silver candlesticks, and  these gave a fair light to the entire room. But, when Sir Launcelot saw the  maiden coming thus with intent to serve him, he arose and took the tray  from her and set it himself upon the table; and for this civility the  damsel made acknowledgement to him. Then she said to him: \"Sir Knight, what  cheer do you have?\" \"Ha, damsel,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I do not know how to  answer you that, for I wist not what cheer to have until I know whether I  be with friends or with enemies. For though this chamber wherein I lie is  very fair and well-bedight, yet meseems I must have been brought here by  some enchantment, and that I am a prisoner in this place; wherefore I know  not what cheer to take.\"    [Sidenote: The damsel has pity for Sir Launcelot] Then the damsel looked  upon Sir Launcelot, and she was very sorry for him. \"Sir,\" quoth she, \"I  take great pity to see you in this pass, for I hear tell you are the best  knight in the world and, of a surety, you are of a very noble appearance. I  must tell you that this castle wherein you lie is a castle of enchantment,  and they who dwell here mean you no good; wherefore I would advise you to  be upon your guard against them.\"    \"Maiden,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I give you grammercy for your kind words,  and I will be upon my guard as you advise me.\"    Then the damsel would have said more, but she durst not for fear that she  should be overheard and that evil should befall her, for the porter was  still without the door. So in a little she went away and Sir Launcelot was  left alone.    But though the damsel bade Sir Launcelot have good cheer, yet he had no  very good cheer for that night, as anyone may well suppose, for he wist not  what was to befall him upon the morrow.    Now when the morning had come Sir Launcelot was aware of someone at his  chamber door, and when that one entered it was Queen Morgana le Fay.    [Sidenote: How Queen Morgana cometh to Sir Launcelot] She was clad in all  the glory at her command, and her appearance was so shining and radiant  that when she came into that room Sir Launcelot knew not whether it was a  vision his eyes beheld or whether she was a creature of flesh and blood.  For she came with her golden crown upon her head, and her hair, which was  as red as gold, was bound around with ribbons of gold; and she was clad all  in cloth of gold; and she wore golden rings with jewels upon her fingers  and golden bracelets upon her arms and a golden collar around her  shoulders; wherefore, when she came into the room she shone with an  extraordinary splendor, as if she were a marvellous statue made all of pure  gold--only that her face was very soft and beautiful, and her eyes shone  exceedingly bright, and her lips, which were as red as coral, smiled, and  her countenance moved and changed with all the wiles of fascination that  she could cause it to assume.    When Sir Launcelot beheld her come thus gloriously into his room he rose  and greeted her with a very profound salutation, for he was astonished  beyond measure at beholding that shining vision. Then Queen Morgana gave  him her hand, and he kneeled, and took her jewelled fingers in his and set  her hand to his lips. \"Welcome, Sir Launcelot!\" quoth she; \"welcome to this  place! For it is indeed a great honor to have here so noble and famous a  knight as you!\"    \"Ha, Lady,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"you are gracious to me beyond measure! But  I pray you tell me how I came to this place and by what means? For when I  fell asleep yesterday at noon I lay beneath an apple-tree upon a hillside;  and when I awoke--lo! I found myself in this fair chamber.\"    [Sidenote: Queen Morgana seeks to beguile Sir Launcelot] To this Queen  Morgana le Fay made smiling reply as follows: \"Sir, I am Queen Morgana le  Fay, of whom you may have heard tell, for I am the sister of King Arthur,  whose particular knight you are. Yesterday, at noon, riding with certain  other queens and a small court of knights, esquires, and demoiselles, we  went by where you lay sleeping. Finding you lying so, alone and without any  companion, I was able, by certain arts which I possess, to lay a gentle  enchantment upon you so that the sleep wherein you lay should remain  unbroken for three or four hours. So we brought you to this place in hopes  that you would stay with us for two or three days or more, and give us the  pleasure of your company. For your fame, which is very great, hath reached  even as far as this place, wherefore we have made a gentle prisoner of you  for this time being.\"    \"Lady,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"such constraint as that would be very pleasing  to me at another time. But when I fell asleep I was with my cousin, Sir  Lionel, and I know not what hath become of him, and haply he will not know  what hath become of me should he seek me. Now I pray you let me go forth  and find my cousin, and when I have done so I will return to you again at  this place with an easy spirit.\"    \"Well, Messire,\" said Queen Morgana, \"it shall be as you desire, only I  require of you some pledge of your return.\" (Herewith she drew from her  finger a golden ring set very richly with several jewels.) \"Now take this  ring,\" she said, \"and give me that ring which I see upon your finger, and  when you shall return hither each shall have his ring again from the  other.\"    \"Lady,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"that may not be. For this ring was placed upon  my finger with such a pledge that it may never leave where it is whilst my  soul abideth in my body. Ask of me any other pledge and you shall have it;  but I cannot give this ring to you.\"    [Sidenote: Queen Morgana hath anger for Sir Launcelot] Upon this Queen  Morgana's cheeks grew very red, and her eyes shone like sparks of fire.  \"Ha, Sir Knight,\" she said, \"I do not think you are very courteous to  refuse a lady and a queen so small a pledge as that. I am much affronted  with you that you should have done so. Wherefore, I now demand of you, as  the sister of King Arthur whom you serve, that you give me that ring.\"    \"Lady,\" said Sir Launcelot, \"I may not do that, though it grieveth me much  to refuse you.\"    Then Queen Morgana looked at Sir Launcelot awhile with a very angry  countenance, but she perceived that she was not to have her will with him,  wherefore she presently turned very quickly and went"]]]
