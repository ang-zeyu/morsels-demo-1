The captain of the  youth's company had been killed in an early part of the action.  His  body lay stretched out in the position of a tired man resting, but upon  his face there was an astonished and sorrowful look, as if he thought  some friend had done him an ill turn.  The babbling man was grazed by a  shot that made the blood stream widely down his face.  He clapped both  hands to his head.  \"Oh!\" he said, and ran.  Another grunted suddenly as  if he had been struck by a club in the stomach.  He sat down and gazed  ruefully.  In his eyes there was mute, indefinite reproach.  Farther up  the line a man, standing behind a tree, had had his knee joint  splintered by a ball.  Immediately he had dropped his rifle and gripped  the tree with both arms.  And there he remained, clinging desperately  and crying for assistance that he might withdraw his hold upon the tree.    At last an exultant yell went along the quivering line.  The firing  dwindled from an uproar to a last vindictive popping.  As the smoke  slowly eddied away, the youth saw that the charge had been repulsed.  The enemy were scattered into reluctant groups.  He saw a man climb to  the top of the fence, straddle the rail, and fire a parting shot.  The  waves had receded, leaving bits of dark \"debris\" upon the ground.    Some in the regiment began to whoop frenziedly.  Many were silent.  Apparently they were trying to contemplate themselves.    After the fever had left his veins, the youth thought that at last he  was going to suffocate.  He became aware of the foul atmosphere in  which he had been struggling.  He was grimy and dripping like a laborer  in a foundry.  He grasped his canteen and took a long swallow of the  warmed water.    A sentence with variations went up and down the line.  \"Well, we 've  helt 'em back.  We 've helt 'em back; derned if we haven't.\" The men  said it blissfully, leering at each other with dirty smiles.    The youth turned to look behind him and off to the right and off to the  left.  He experienced the joy of a man who at last finds leisure in  which to look about him.    Under foot there were a few ghastly forms motionless.  They lay twisted  in fantastic contortions.  Arms were bent and heads were turned in  incredible ways.  It seemed that the dead men must have fallen from  some great height to get into such positions.  They looked to be dumped  out upon the ground from the sky.    From a position in the rear of the grove a battery was throwing shells  over it.  The flash of the guns startled the youth at first.  He  thought they were aimed directly at him.  Through the trees he watched  the black figures of the gunners as they worked swiftly and intently.  Their labor seemed a complicated thing.  He wondered how they could  remember its formula in the midst of confusion.    The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs.  They argued with abrupt  violence.  It was a grim pow-wow.  Their busy servants ran hither and  thither.    A small procession of wounded men were going drearily toward the rear.  It was a flow of blood from the torn body of the brigade.    To the right and to the left were the dark lines of other troops.  Far  in front he thought he could see lighter masses protruding in points  from the forest.  They were suggestive of unnumbered thousands.    Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line of the horizon.  The tiny riders were beating the tiny horses.    From a sloping hill came the sound of cheerings and clashes.  Smoke  welled slowly through the leaves.    Batteries were speaking with thunderous oratorical effort.  Here and  there were flags, the red in the stripes dominating.  They splashed  bits of warm color upon the dark lines of troops.    The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblems.  They were  like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.    As he listened to the din from the hillside, to a deep pulsating  thunder that came from afar to the left, and to the lesser clamors  which came from many directions, it occurred to him that they were  fighting, too, over there, and over there, and over there.  Heretofore  he had supposed that all the battle was directly under his nose.    As he gazed around him the youth felt a flash of astonishment at the  blue, pure sky and the sun gleamings on the trees and fields.  It was  surprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden process  in the midst of so much devilment.          Chapter 6      The youth awakened slowly.  He came gradually back to a position from  which he could regard himself.  For moments he had been scrutinizing  his person in a dazed way as if he had never before seen himself.  Then  he picked up his cap from the ground.  He wriggled in his jacket to  make a more comfortable fit, and kneeling relaced his shoe.  He  thoughtfully mopped his reeking features.    So it was all over at last!  The supreme trial had been passed.  The  red, formidable difficulties of war had been vanquished.    He went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction.  He had the most  delightful sensations of his life.  Standing as if apart from himself,  he viewed that last scene.  He perceived that the man who had fought  thus was magnificent.    He felt that he was a fine fellow.  He saw himself even with those  ideals which he had considered as far beyond him.  He smiled in deep  gratification.    Upon his fellows he beamed tenderness and good will.  \"Gee! ain't it  hot, hey?\" he said affably to a man who was polishing his streaming  face with his coat sleeves.    \"You bet!\" said the other, grinning sociably.  \"I never seen sech dumb  hotness.\"  He sprawled out luxuriously on the ground.  \"Gee, yes!  An'  I hope we don't have no more fightin' till a week from Monday.\"    There were some handshakings and deep speeches with men whose features  were familiar, but with whom the youth now felt the bonds of tied  hearts.  He helped a cursing comrade to bind up a wound of the shin.    But, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke out along the ranks of the  new regiment.  \"Here they come ag'in!  Here they come ag'in!\" The man  who had sprawled upon the ground started up and said, \"Gosh!\"    The youth turned quick eyes upon the field.  He discerned forms begin  to swell in masses out of a distant wood.  He again saw the tilted flag  speeding forward.    The shells, which had ceased to trouble the regiment for a time, came  swirling again, and exploded in the grass or among the leaves of the  trees.  They looked to be strange war flowers bursting into fierce  bloom.    The men groaned.  The luster faded from their eyes.  Their smudged  countenances now expressed a profound dejection.  They moved their  stiffened bodies slowly, and watched in sullen mood the frantic  approach of the enemy.  The slaves toiling in the temple of this god  began to feel rebellion at his harsh tasks.    They fretted and complained each to each.  \"Oh, say, this is too much  of a good thing!  Why can't somebody send us supports?\"    \"We ain't never goin' to stand this second banging.  I didn't come here  to fight the hull damn' rebel army.\"    There was one who raised a doleful cry.  \"I wish Bill Smithers had trod  on my hand, insteader me treddin' on his'n.\"  The sore joints of the  regiment creaked as it painfully floundered into position to repulse.    The youth stared.  Surely, he thought, this impossible thing was not  about to happen.  He waited as if he expected the enemy to suddenly  stop, apologize, and retire bowing.  It was all a mistake.    But the firing began somewhere on the regimental line and ripped along  in both directions.  The level sheets of flame developed great clouds  of smoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild wind near the ground for a  moment, and then rolled through the ranks as through a gate.  The  clouds were tinged an earthlike yellow in the sunrays and in the shadow  were a sorry blue.  The flag was sometimes eaten and lost in this mass  of vapor, but more often it projected, sun-touched, resplendent.    Into the youth's eyes there came a look that one can see in the orbs of  a jaded horse.  His neck was quivering with nervous weakness and the  muscles of his arms felt numb and bloodless.  His hands, too, seemed  large and awkward as if he was wearing invisible mittens.  And there  was a great uncertainty about his knee joints.    The words that comrades had uttered previous to the firing began to  recur to him.  \"Oh, say, this is too much of a good thing!  What do  they take us for--why don't they send supports?  I didn't come here to  fight the hull damned rebel army.\"    He began to exaggerate the endurance, the skill, and the valor of those  who were coming.  Himself reeling from exhaustion, he was astonished  beyond measure at such persistency.  They must be machines of steel.  It was very gloomy struggling against such affairs, wound up perhaps to  fight until sundown.    He slowly lifted his rifle and catching a glimpse of the thickspread  field he blazed at a cantering cluster.  He stopped then and began to  peer as best as he could through the smoke.  He caught changing views  of the ground covered with men who were all running like pursued imps,  and yelling.    To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubtable dragons.  He became  like the man who lost his legs at the approach of the red and green  monster.  He waited in a sort of a horrified, listening attitude.  He  seemed to shut his eyes and wait to be gobbled.    A man near him who up to this time had been working feverishly at his  rifle suddenly stopped and ran with howls.  A lad whose face had borne  an expression of exalted courage, the majesty of he who dares give his  life, was, at an instant, smitten abject.  He blanched like one who has  come to the edge of a cliff at midnight and is suddenly made aware.  There was a revelation.  He, too, threw down his gun and fled.  There  was no shame in his face.  He ran like a rabbit.

There was no unjust law  which the Suffrage Association could not have changed during these fifty  years, had it cared to try, and indeed its members make the boast that  many of the changes are their own. Change and improvement of laws was not  their aim. It was a vote upon changing or not changing laws that they  sought for. The difference is world-wide.    The third count in the indictment runs: \"He has withheld from her rights  which are given to the most ignorant men--both natives and foreigners.\"  Dr. Jacobi represented the Suffrage cause before the Special Committee of  the Constitutional Convention of New York State in 1894. After drawing, in  fine and truthfully glowing words, a picture of woman's progress under the  institutions and laws of the United States, she said: \"For the first time,  all political right, privilege and power reposes undisguisedly on the one  brutal fact of sex, unsupported, untempered, unalloyed by any attribute of  education, any justification of intelligence, any glamour of wealthy any  prestige of birth, any insignia of actual power.... To-day, the immigrants  pouring in through the open gates of our seaport towns, the Indian when  settled in severalty, the negro hardly emancipated from the degradation of  two hundred years of slavery,--may all share in the sovereignty of the  State. The white woman,--the woman in whose veins runs the blood of those  heroic colonists who founded our country, of those women who helped to  sustain the courage of their husbands in the Revolutionary War; the woman  who may have given the flower of her youth and health in the service of  our Civil War--that woman is excluded. To-day women constitute the only  class of sane people excluded from the franchise, the only class deprived  of political representation, except the tribal Indians and the Chinese.\"  To the same effect the editors of the \"Suffrage History\" say: \"The  superiority of man does not enter into the demand for suffrage; for in  this country all men vote; and as the lower orders, of men are not  superior to the higher orders of women, they must hold and exercise the  right of self-government on some other ground than superiority to woman.\"  Here it would seem that Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony had been thinking,  but they never followed their own thought to its inevitable conclusion.  Universal manhood suffrage does relieve the men of this country from the  unjust aspersion the women of the Suffrage movement put upon them, that  they excluded women on account of inferiority.    No native American, who by the very fact of that nativity is bound to  support the Constitution of the United States, and no foreign-born citizen  who has taken the oath of allegiance to it, has a right by his vote to do  anything that will imperil or impede the carrying out of its principles  and its commands. \"The establishment of justice, the insurement of  domestic tranquillity, provision for the common defence, security in the  blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,\" cannot be perfected  or maintained without the present exercise and the reserve power of  manhood strength. This Government laid aside all \"attribute of education,  or glamour of wealth, or prestige of birth,\" and committed its life to the  keeping of its defenders. In this land, the vote is the \"insignia of  actual power,\" but it is only the insignia; the power to defend themselves  and those who make country and home worth defending, lies with the  individual defenders. To attempt to put it into the hands of those who are  not physically fitted to maintain the obligations that may result from any  vote or any legislative act, is to render law a farce, and to betray the  trust imposed upon them by the constitution they have sworn to uphold.  Universal manhood suffrage is the crowning result in the long evolution of  government. Our statesmen of the Revolutionary period did not contemplate  it. But stability was the thing for which they sought--the thing for which  all statesmen of all times have been searching. If a government is not  stable, it is of little consequence that it is full of noble ideals; and  the most far-reaching thought has now grasped the idea that manhood  strength is the natural and only defence of the state. This is the  underlying theory of our Government, the one solid rock on which it rests.  \"When any question of governmental policy comes up, we virtually decide  it, sooner or later, by a manhood vote; and as the decision has a majority  of the men of the country behind it, there is no power that can overthrow  it. If we attempt to establish policies or execute laws to which a  majority of the men are opposed, we throw away our one assurance of  stability, and are in constant danger of revolution. Even in the  comparatively brief history of our Republic, there are plentiful instances  to show that a majority of men will not submit to a minority, no matter  how many non-combatants are joined with that minority. To give women a  position of apparent power, without its reality, would be to make our  Government forever unstable.    \"This is placing the Christian and civilized Government that stands as an  example of peaceful progress on a foundation of brute force,\" cries the  Suffragist. The founders of the Woman Suffrage movement apparently did not  take the least account of either the military or the judicial powers that  are provided for in every State constitution, as well as in the Nation's.  They demanded \"immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which  belong to them as citizens of the United States,\" but said not a word  about the duties, disabilities, and money loss involved in the possession  of those rights and privileges. The Fathers of the Revolution closed their  Declaration of Independence from the tyranny of England by pledging \"their  lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor\" to attain it. The Mothers of  the Woman's Rebellion closed their Declaration of Independence from the  tyranny of man, and especially from the tyranny of the United States  Government, with a pledge to distribute tracts and hold conventions, while  they depended upon the courtesy of the tyrants to protect them in the  peaceful execution of their design. Is it any wonder that the descendants  of the old heroes who had fought their way to our liberties smiled when  the by-laws of the would-be revolt were handed to them?    When the attention of the women was called to the fact that force was  needed, and that women were exempt from military service and jury and  police duty, they answered that \"In an age when the wrongs of society are  adjusted in the courts and at the ballot-box, material force yields to  reason and majorities.\" So successful has our Government been in carrying  out the benign purposes for which its heroes staked their lives, their  fortunes, and their sacred honor, that in ordinary times we see little of  the strength that stands quietly but firmly behind every law's enactment  and every poll's decision. The \"strong arm\" of the law would lose its  power to compel obedience if behind the decree of judge, jury, and  legislators there was not a sheriff or a body of militia ready to commit  the unconsenting criminal to prison, or to take care of an unruly  minority. At an election, the minority do not acquiesce in the decision of  the majority because the outcome of the vote has convinced them that the  majority were right, and they were wrong. They have not become suddenly  converted to the views of the majority. That decision, as recorded by the  ballot, shows that if the minority do not keep their opinion in abeyance,  there are men enough on the other side to compel them. Civilization has  advanced so far that, instead of blows there are arguments in court,  instead of bullets there are ballots at the polls; but the blows and the  bullets must always be ready, in case the arguments and the ballots are  unheeded. The physical strength that was given to man to use, like every  other gift, for the good of the race, he is so using when he holds it as a  _dernier ressort_ for law and order.    Dr. Jacobi says, in her address, \"capacity to bear arms, in fulfilment of  military duty, is not, in the State of New York, reckoned among the  necessary qualifications of voters.\" The statement is also made by other  Suffragists that \"numerous classes of men who enjoy political rights are  exempt from military duty,--all men over forty-five, all who suffer mental  or physical disability, such as the loss of an eye or a forefinger;  clergymen, physicians, Quakers, school-teachers, professors, and  presidents of colleges, judges, legislators, congressmen, state-prison  officials, and all county, State, and National officers; fathers,  brothers, or sons having certain relatives dependent upon them for  support, all of these summed up in every State would make millions who may  be exempted, and therefore there is no force in the plea that if women  vote they must fight.\" It is not true that any class of voters is exempt.  The State, regulating that matter as it regulates the age and residence of  voters, as long as it has more defenders than it needs for immediate use,  makes demand upon the youngest or strongest, but if it needs them all,  then all must serve. Again, all, whether young or old, perfect or  imperfect, must be reckoned with as elements in making up the count.  Lawless men do not exempt themselves from riot and rebellion because they  are lame or over forty-five. In the South, during the Rebellion, there  were few indeed who did not serve in some capacity. If there were blind  and aged men enough to make a real difference "]]]
