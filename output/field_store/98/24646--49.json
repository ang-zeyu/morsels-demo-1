Marius in Italia,  divus Julius in Gallia, Drusus ac Nero et Germanicus in suis eos sedibus  perculerunt. Mox ingentes C. Caesaris minae in ludibrium versae. Inde  otium, donec occasione discordiae nostrae et civilium armorum, expugnatis  legionum hibernis, etiam Gallias affectavere: ac rursus pulsi, inde  proximis temporibus triumphati magis quam victi sunt.    XXXVIII. Nunc de Suevis dicendum est, quorum non una, ut Chattorum  Tencterorumve, gens: majorem enim Germaniae partem obtinent, propriis  adhuc nationibus nominibusque discreti, quanquam in commune Suevi  vocentur. Insigne gentis obliquare crinem nodoque substringere: sic Suevi  a ceteris Germanis, sic Suevorum ingenui a servis separantur in aliis  gentibus, seu cognatione aliqua Suevorum, seu quod saepe accidit,  imitatione, rarum et intra juventae spatium; apud Suevos, usque ad  canitiem, horrentem capillum retro sequuntur, ac saepe in ipso solo  vertice religant. Principes et ornatiorem habent: ea cura formae, sed  innoxiae: neque enim ut ament amenturve; in altitudinem quandam et  terrorem, adituri bella, compti, ut hostium oculis, ornantur.    XXXIX. Vetustissimos se nobilissimosque Suevorum Semnones memorant.  Fides antiquitatis religione firmatur. Stato tempore in silvam auguriis  patrum et prisca formidine sacram, omnes ejusdem sanguinis populi  legationibus coeunt, caesoque publice homine celebrant barbari ritus  horrenda primordia. Est et alia luco reverentia. Nemo nisi vinculo  ligatus ingreditur, ut minor et potestatem numinis prae se ferens, Si  forte prolapsus est, attolli et insurgere haud licitum: per humum  evolvuntur: eoque omnis superstitio respicit, tanquam inde initia gentis,  ibi regnator omnium deus, cetera subjecta atque parentia. Adjicit  auctoritatem fortuna Semnonum: centum pagis habitantur; magnoque corpore  efficitur, ut se Suevorum caput credant.    XL. Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis ac valentissimis  nationibus cincti, non per obsequium, sed proeliis et periclitando tuti  sunt. Reudigni deinde et Aviones et Anglii et Varini et Eudoses et  Suardones et Nuithones fluminibus aut silvis muniuntur: nec quidquam  notabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune Nerthum, id est Terram matrem  colunt, eamque intervenire rebus hominum, invehi populis arbitrantur. Est  in insula Oceani castum nemus, dicatumque in eo vehiculum, veste  contectum attingere uni sacerdoti concessum. Is adesse penetrali deam  intelligit, vectamque bubus feminis multa cum veneratione prosequitur.  Laeti tunc dies, festa loca, quaecumque adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non  bella ineunt, non arma sumunt; clausum omne ferrum: pax et quies tunc  tantum nota, tunc tantum amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam  conversatione mortalium deam templo reddat. Mox vehiculum et vestes, et,  si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant,  quos statim idem lacus haurit; arcanus hinc terror sanctaque ignorantia,  quid sit illud, quod tantum perituri vident.    XLI. Et haec quidem pars Suevorum in secretiora Germaniae porrigitur.  Propior, ut quo modo paulo ante Rhenum, sic nunc Danubium sequar,  Hermundurorum civitas, fida Romanis, eoque solis Germanorum non in ripa  commercium, sed penitus, atque in splendidissima Rhaetiae provinciae  colonia. Passim et sine custode transeunt: et, cum ceteris gentibus arma  modo castraque nostra ostendamus, his domos villasque patefecimus non  concupiscentibus. In Hermunduris Albis oritur, flumen inclitum et notum  olim; nunc tantum auditur.    XLII. Juxta Hermunduros Narisci, ac deinde Marcomanni et Quadi agunt.  Praecipua Marcomannorum gloria viresque, atque ipsa etiam sedes, pulsis  olim Boiis, virtute parta. Nec Narisci Quadive degenerant. Eaque  Germaniae velut frons est, quatenus Danubio peragitur. Marcomannis  Quadisque usque ad nostram memoriam reges manserunt ex gente ipsorum,  nobile Marobodui et Tudri genus: jam et externos patiuntur. Sed vis et  potentia regibus ex auctoritate Romana: raro armis nostris, saepius  pecunia juvantur, nec minus valent.    XLIII. Retro Marsigni, Gothini, Osi, Burii, terga Marcomannorum  Quadorumque claudunt: e quibus Marsigni et Burii sermone cultuque Suevos  referunt Gothinos Gallica, Osos Pannonica lingua coarguit non esse  Germanos, et quod tributa patiuntur. Partem tributorum Sarmatae, partem  Quadi, ut alienigenis, imponunt. Gothini, quo magis pudeat, et ferrum  effodiunt. Omnesque hi populi pauca campestrium, ceterum saltus et  vertices montium jugumque insederunt. Dirimit enim scinditque Sueviam  continuum montium jugum, ultra quod plurimae gentes agunt: ex quibus  latissime patet Lygiorum nomen in plures civitates diffusum.  Valentissimas nominasse sufficiet, Arios, Helveconas, Manimos, Elysios,  Naharvalos. Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur.  Praesidet sacerdos muliebri ornatu: sed deos, interpretatione Romana,  Castorem Pollucemque memorant: ea vis numini; nomen Alcis. Nulla  simulacra, nullum peregrinae superstitionis vestigium: ut fratres tamen,  ut juvenes, venerantur. Ceterum Arii super vires, quibus enumeratos paulo  ante populos antecedunt, truces, insitae feritati arte ac tempore  lenocinantur. Nigra scuta, tincta corpora: atras ad proelia noctes  legunt: ipsaque formidine atque umbra feralis exercitus terrorem  inferant, nullo hostium sustinente novum ac velut infernum aspectum: nam  primi in omnibus proeliis oculi vincuntur. Trans Lygios Gothones  regnantur, paulo jam adductius, quam ceterae Germanorum gentes, nondum  tamen supra libertatem. Protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemovii  omniumque harum gentium insigne, rotunda scuta, breves gladii, et erga  reges obsequium.    XLIV. Suionum hinc civitates, ipso in Oceano, praeter viros armaque  classibus valent: forma navium eo differt, quod utrimque prora paratam  semper appulsui frontem agit: nec velis ministrantur, nec remos in  ordinem lateribus adjungunt. Solutum, ut in quibusdam fluminum, et  mutabile, ut res poscit, hinc vel illinc remigium. Est apud illos et  opibus honos; eoque unus imperitat, nullis jam exceptionibus, non  precario jure parendi. Nec arma, ut apud ceteros Germanos, in promiscuo,  sed clausa sub custode et quidem servo: quia subitos hostium incursus  prohibet Oceanus, otiosa porro armatorum manus facile lasciviunt:  enimvero neque nobilem neque ingenuum ne libertinum quidem, armis  praeponere regia utilitas est.    XLV. Trans Suionas aliud mare, pigrum ac prope immotum, quo cingi  cludique terrarum orbem hinc fides, quod extremus cadentis jam solis  fulgor in ortus edurat adeo clarus, ut sidera hebetet; sonum insuper  audiri, formasque deorum et radios capitis aspici persuasio adjicit.  Illuc usque, et fama vera, tantum natura. Ergo jam dextro Suevici maris  littore Aestyorum gentes alluuntur: quibus ritus habitusque Suevorum;  lingua Britannicae propior. Matrem deum venerantur: insigne  superstitionis, formas aprorum gestant; id pro armis omnique tutela:  securum deae cultorem etiam inter hostes praestat. Rarus ferri, frequens  fustium usus. Frumenta ceterosque fructus patientius, quam pro solita  Germanorum inertia, laborant. Sed et mare scrutantur, ac soli omnium  succinum, quod ipsi glesum vocant inter vada atque in ipso littore  legunt. Nec, quae natura quaeve ratio gignat, ut barbaris, quaesitum  compertumve. Diu quin etiam inter cetera ejectamenta maris jacebat, donec  luxuria nostra dedit nomen: ipsis in nullo usu: rude legitur, informe  perfertur, pretiumque mirantes accipiunt. Succum tamen arborum esse  intelligas, quia terrena quaedam atque etiam volucria animalia plerumque  interlucent, quae implicata humore, mox, durescente materia, cluduntur.  Fecundiora igitur nemora lucosque, sicut Orientis secretis, ubi thura  balsamaque sudantur, ita Occidentis insulis terrisque inesse, crediderim;  quae vicini solis radiis expressa atque liquentia in proximum mare  labuntur, ac vi tempestatum in adversa littora exundant. Si naturam  succini admoto igne tentes, in modum taedae accenditur, alitque flammam  pinguem et olentem: mox ut in picem resinamve lentescit. Suionibus  Sitonum gentes continuantur. Cetera similes, uno differunt, quod femina  dominatur: in tantum non modo a libertate, sed etiam a servitute  degenerant.    XLVI. Hic Sueviae finis. Peucinorum Vene dorumque et Fennorum nationes  Germanis an Sarmatis ascribam, dubito: quanquam Peucini, quos quidam  Bastarnas vocant, sermone, cultu, sede ac domiciliis, ut Germani, agunt.  Sordes omnium ac torpor procerum: connubiis mixtis, nonnihil in  Sarmatarum habitum foedantur. Venedi multum ex moribus traxerunt. Nam  quidquid inter Peucinos Fennosque silvarum ac montium erigitur,  latrociniis pererrant. Hi tamen inter Germanos potius referuntur, quia et  domos figunt et scuta gestant et pedum usu ac pernicitate gaudent; quae  omnia diversa Sarmatis sunt, in plaustro equoque viventibus. Fennis mira  feritas, foeda paupertas: non arma, non equi, non penates: victui herba,  vestitui pelles, cubile humus: sola in sagittis spes, quas, inopia ferri,  ossibus asperant. Idemque venatus viros pariter ac feminas alit. Passim  enim comitantur, partemque praedae petunt. Nec aliud infantibus ferarum  imbriumque suffugium, quam ut in aliquo ramorum nexu contegantur: huc  redeunt juvenes, hoc senum receptaculum. Sed beatius arbitrantur, quam  ingemere agris, illaborare domibus, suas alienasque fortunas spe metuque  versare. Securi adversus homines, securi adversus deos, rem difficillimam  assecuti sunt, ut illis ne vote quidem opus esset. Cetera jam fabulosa:  Hellusios et Oxionas ora hominum vultusque, corpora atque artus ferarum,  gerere: quod ego, ut incompertum, in medium relinquam.              CN. JULII AGRICOLAE VITA.

When a subject has been referred to a committee which reports at the  same meeting, the matter stands before the assembly as if it had been  introduced for the first time.  A motion which has been withdrawn has  not been acted upon, and therefore can be renewed.    27. Reconsider.  It is in order at any time, even when another member  has the floor, or while the assembly is voting on the motion to Adjourn,  during the day* [In Congress any one can move a reconsideration,  excepting where the vote is taken by yeas and nays [Sec. 38], when the rule  above applies.  The motion can be made on the same or succeeding day.]  on which a motion has been acted upon, to move to \"Reconsider the vote\"  and have such motion \"entered on the record,\" but it cannot be  considered while another question is before the assembly.  It must be  made, excepting when the vote is by ballot, by a member who voted with  the prevailing side; for instance, in case a motion fails to pass for  lack of a two-thirds vote, a reconsideration must be moved by one who  voted against the motion.    A motion to reconsider the vote on a Subsidiary [Sec. 7] motion takes  precedence of the main question.  It yields to Privileged [Sec. 9]    === Page 50 ============================================================    questions (except for the Orders of the Day), and Incidental [Sec. 8]  questions.    This motion can be applied* [It is not the practice to reconsider an  affirmative vote on the motion to lie on the table, as the same result  can be more easily reached by the motion to take from the table.  For a  similar reason, an affirmative vote on the motion to take from the table  cannot be reconsidered.] to every question, except to Adjourn and to  Suspend the Rules.  It is debatable or not, just as the question to be  reconsidered is debatable or undebatable [Sec. 35]; when debatable, it  opens up for discussion the entire subject to be reconsidered, and can  have the Previous question [Sec. 20] applied to it without affecting any  thing but the motion to reconsider.  It can be laid on the table [Sec. 19],  and in such cases the last motion cannot be reconsidered; it is quite  common and allowable to combine these two motions (though they must be  voted on separately); in this case, the reconsideration like any other  question, can be taken from the table, but possesses no privilege.** [In  Congress this is a common method used by the friends of a measure to  prevent its reconsideration.] The motion to reconsider being laid on the  table does not carry with it the pending measure.  If an amendment to a  motion has been either adopted or rejected, and then a vote taken on the  motion as amended, it is not in order to reconsider the vote on the  amendment until    === Page 51 ============================================================    after the vote on the original motion has been reconsidered.  If  anything which the assembly cannot reverse, has been done as the result  a vote, then that vote cannot be reconsidered.    The Effect of making this motion is to suspend all action that the  original motion would have required until the reconsideration is acted  upon; but if it is not called up, its effect terminates with the session  [Sec. 42], provided,* [In Congress the effect always terminates with the  session, and it cannot be called up by any one but the mover, until the  expiration of the time during which it is in order to move a  reconsideration.] that in an assembly having regular meetings as often  as monthly, if no adjourned meeting upon another day is held of the one  at which the reconsideration was moved, its effect shall not terminate  till the close of the next succeeding session.  [See note at end of this  section.] While this motion is so highly privileged as far as relates to  having it entered on the minutes, yet the reconsideration of another  question cannot be made to interfere with the discussion of a question  before the assembly, but as soon as that subject is disposed of, the  reconsideration, if called up, takes precedence of every thing except  the motions to adjourn, and to fix the time to which to adjourn.  As  long as its effect lasts (as shown above), any one can call up the  motion to reconsider and have it acted upon--excepting that when its  effect extends beyond the meeting at which the motion was made, no one  but the mover can call it up at that meeting.  But the reconsideration  of an Incidental [Sec. 8] or Subsidiary [Sec. 7]    === Page 52 ============================================================    motion shall be immediately acted upon, as otherwise it would prevent  action on the main question.    The Effect of the adoption of this motion is to place before the  assembly the original question in the exact position it occupied before  it was voted upon; consequently no one can debate the question  reconsidered who had previously exhausted his right of debate [Sec. 34] on  that question; his only resource is to discuss the question while the  motion to reconsider is before the assembly.    When a vote taken under the operation of the previous question [Sec. 20] is  reconsidered, the question is then divested of the previous question,  and is open to debate and amendment, provided the previous question had  been exhausted [see latter part of Sec. 20] by votes taken on all the  questions covered by it, before the motion to reconsider was made.    A reconsideration requires only a majority vote, regardless of the vote  necessary to adopt the motion reconsidered.  [For reconsidering in  committee see Sec. 28].    Note On Reconsider.--In the English Parliament a vote once taken  cannot be reconsidered, but in our Congress it is allowed to move a  reconsideration of the vote on the same or succeeding day, and after the  close of the last day for making the motion, any one can call up the  motion to reconsider, so that this motion cannot delay action more than  two days, and the effect    === Page 53 ============================================================    of the motion, if not acted upon, terminates with the session.  There  seems to be no reason or good precedent for permitting merely two  persons, by moving a reconsideration, to suspend for any length of time  all action under resolutions adopted by the assembly, and yet where the  delay is very short the advantages of reconsideration overbalance the  evils.    Where a permanent society has meetings weekly or monthly, and usually  only a small proportion of the society is present, it seems best to  allow a reconsideration to hold over to another meeting, so that the  society may have notice of what action is about to be taken.  To prevent  the motion being used to defeat a measure that cannot be deferred till  the next regular meeting, it is provided that in case the society  adjourn, to meet the next day for instance, then the reconsideration  will not hold over beyond that session; this allows sufficient delay to  notify the society, while, if the question is one requiring immediate  action, the delay cannot extend beyond the day to which they adjourn.  Where the meetings are only quarterly or annual, the society should be  properly represented at each meeting, and their best interests are  subserved by following the practice of Congress, and letting the effect  of the reconsideration terminate with the session.    === Page 54 ============================================================    Art. IV.  Committees and Informal Action.  [Sec.Sec. 28-33.]    28. Committees.  It is usual in deliberative assemblies, to have all  preliminary work in the preparation of matter for their action, done by  means of committees.  These may be either \"standing committees\" (which  are appointed for the session [Sec. 42], or for some definite time, as one  year); or \"select committees,\" appointed for a special purpose; or a  \"committee of the whole\" [Sec. 32], consisting of the entire assembly.  [For method of appointing committees of the whole, see Sec. 32; other  committees, see commit, Sec. 22.] The first person named on a committee is  chairman, and should act as such, without the committee should see fit  to elect another chairman, which they are competent to do.  The clerk  should furnish him, or some other member of the committee, with notice  of the appointment of the committee, giving the names    === Page 55 ============================================================    of the members, the matter referred to them, and such instructions as  the assembly have decided upon.  The chairman shall call the committee  together, and if there is a quorum (a majority of the committee, see Sec.  43,) he should read or have read, the entire resolutions referred to  them; he should then read each paragraph, and pause for amendments to be  offered; when the amendments to that paragraph are voted on he proceeds  to the next, only taking votes on amendments, as the committee cannot  vote on the adoption of matter referred to them by the assembly.    If the committee originate the resolutions, they vote, in the same way,  on amendments to each paragraph of the draft of the resolutions, (which  draft has been previously prepared by one of their members or a  sub-committee); they do not vote on the separate paragraphs, but having  completed the amendments, they vote on the adoption of the entire  report.  When there is a preamble, it is considered last.  If the report  originates with the committee, all amendments are to be incorporated in  the report; but, if the resolutions were referred, the committee cannot  alter    === Page 56 ============================================================    the text, but must submit the original paper intact, with their  amendments (which may be in the form of a substitute, Sec. 23) written on a  separate sheet.
