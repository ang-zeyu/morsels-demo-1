When God had in V. daies made perfecte the heauens and the earth, and the  furniture of bothe: whiche the Latines for the goodlinesse and beautie  thereof, call Mundus, and we (I knowe not for what reason) haue named the  worlde: the sixth daie, to the entent there mighte be one to enioye, and be  Lorde ooer all, he made the moste notable creature Man.

For giltelesse  dealyng, wrong came in place, for deuoutnesse, contempte of the Goddes, and  so farre outraged their wickednes, that God skarcely fyndyng one iuste Noha  on the earth (whom he saued, with his housholde, to repayre the losse of  mankind and replenysshe the worlde) sente a floude vniuersall, which  couering all vnder water, killed all fleshe that bare lyfe vppon earth,  excepte a fewe beastes, birdes, and wormes that ware preserued in the  misticall arke.

It is impossible to found a political society or a state  upon gentes. A state must rest upon territory and not upon persons,  upon the township as the unit of a political system, and not upon  the gens, which is the unit of a social system. It required time and  a vast experience, beyond that of the American Indian tribes, as a  preparation for such a fundamental change of systems. It also  required men of the mental stature of the Greeks and Romans, and  with the experience derived from a long chain of ancestors, to  devise and gradually introduce that new plan of government under  which civilized nations are living at the present time.        THE CONFEDERACY OF TRIBES      A tendency to confederate for mutual defense would very naturally  exist among kindred and contiguous tribes. When the advantages of a  union had been appreciated by actual experience, the organization,  at first a league, would gradually cement into a federal unity. The  state of perpetual warfare in which they lived would quicken this  natural tendency into action among such tribes as were sufficiently  advanced in intelligence and in the arts of life to perceive its  benefits. It would be simply a growth from a lower into a higher  organization by an extension of the principle which united the  gentes in a tribe.    As might have been expected, several confederacies existed in  different parts of North America when discovered, some of which were  quite remarkable in plan and structure. Among the number may be  mentioned the Iroquois Confederacy of five independent tribes, the  Creek Confederacy of six, the Ottawa Confederacy of three, the  Dakota League of the \"Seven Council Fires,\" the Moki Confederacy in  New Mexico of Seven Pueblos, and the Aztec Confederacy of three  tribes in the Valley of Mexico. It is probable that the Village  Indians in other parts of Mexico, in Central and in South America  were quite generally organized in confederacies consisting of two or  more kindred tribes. Progress necessarily took this direction from  the nature of their institutions and from the law governing their  development. Nevertheless the formation of a confederacy out of such  materials and with such unstable geographical relations was a  difficult undertaking. It was easiest of achievement by the Village  Indians from the nearness to each other of their pueblos and from  the smallness of their areas; but it was accomplished in occasional  instances by tribes in the Lower Status of barbarism, and notably by  the Iroquois. Wherever a confederacy was formed it would of itself  evince the superior intelligence of the people.    The two highest examples of Indian confederacies in North America  were those of the Iroquois and of the Aztecs. From their  acknowledged superiority as military powers, and from their  geographical positions, these confederacies in both cases produced  remarkable results. Our knowledge of the structure and principles of  the former is definite and complete, while of the latter it is far  from satisfactory. The Aztec Confederacy has been handled in such a  manner historically as to leave it doubtful whether it was simply a  league of three kindred tribes, offensive and defensive, or a  systematic confederacy like that of the Iroquois. That which is true  of the latter was probably in a general sense true of the former, so  that a knowledge of one will tend to elucidate the other.    The conditions under which confederacies spring into being and the  principles on which they are formed are remarkably simple. They grow  naturally with time out of pre-existing elements. Where one tribe  had divided into several, and these subdivisions occupied  independent but contiguous territories, the confederacy reintegrated  them in a higher organization on the basis of the common gentes they  possessed and of the affiliated dialects they spoke. The sentiment  of kin embodied in the gens, the common lineage of the gentes, and  their dialects, still mutually intelligible, yielded the material  elements for a confederation. The confederacy, therefore, had the  gentes for its basis and center, and stock language for its  circumference. No one has been found that reached beyond the bounds  of the dialects of a common language. If this natural barrier had  been crossed it would have forced heterogeneous elements into the  organization. Cases have occurred where the remains of a tribe, not  cognate in speech, as the Natchez, [Footnote: They were admitted  into the Creek Confederacy after their overthrow by the French.]  have been admitted into an existing confederacy, but this exception  would not invalidate the general proposition. It was impossible for  an Indian power to arise upon the American continent through a  confederacy of tribes organized in gentes, and advance to a general  supremacy, unless their numbers were developed from their own stock.  The multitude of stock languages is a standing explanation of the  failure. There was no possible way of becoming connected on equal  terms with a confederacy excepting through membership in a gens and  tribe and a common speech.    The Iroquois have furnished an excellent illustration of the manner  in which a confederacy is formed by natural growth assisted by  skillful legislation. Originally emigrants from beyond the  Mississippi, and possibly a branch of the Dakota stock, they first  made their way to the valley of the St. Lawrence and settled  themselves near Montreal. Forced to leave this region by the  hostility of surrounding tribes, they sought the central region of  New York. Coasting the eastern shore of Lake Ontario in canoes, for  their numbers were small, they made their first settlement at the  mouth of the Oswego River, where, according to their traditions,  they remained for a long period of time. They were then in at least  three distinct tribes, the Mohawks, the Onondagas, and the Senecas.  One tribe subsequently established themselves at the head of the  Canandaigua Lake and became the Senecas. Another tribe occupied the  Onondaga Valley and became the Onondagas. The third passed eastward  and settled first at Oneida, near the site of Utica, from which  place the main portion removed to the Mohawk Valley and became the  Mohawks. Those who remained became the Oneidas. A portion of the  Onondagas or Senecas settled along the eastern shore of the Cayuga  Lake and became the Cayugas. New York, before its occupation by the  Iroquois, seems to have been a part of the area of the Algonkin  tribes. According to Iroquois traditions, they displaced its  anterior inhabitants as they gradually extended their settlements  eastward to the Hudson and westward to the Genesee. Their traditions  further declare that a long period of time elapsed after their  settlement in New York before the confederacy was formed, during  which they made common cause against their enemies, and thus  experienced the advantages of the federal principle both for  aggression and defense. They resided in villages, which were usually  surrounded with stockades, and subsisted upon fish and game and the  products of a limited horticulture. In numbers they did not at any  time exceed 20,000 souls, if they ever reached that number.  Precarious subsistence and incessant warfare repressed numbers in  all the aboriginal tribes, including the Village Indians as well.  The Iroquois were enshrouded in the great forests which then  overspread New York, against which they had no power to contend.  They were first discovered A. D. 1608. About 1675 they attained  their culminating point, when their dominion reached over an area  remarkably large, covering the greater parts of New York,  Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and portions of Canada north of Lake Ontario.  [Footnote: About 1651-1655 they expelled their kindred tribes, the  Eries, from the region between the Genesee River and Lake Erie, and  shortly afterwards the Neutral Nations from the Niagara River, and  thus came into possession of the remainder of New York, with the  exception of the Lower Hudson and Long Island.]    At the time of their discovery they were the highest representatives  of the red race north of New Mexico in intelligence and advancement,  though perhaps inferior to some of the Gulf tribes in the arts of  life. In the extent and quality of their mental endowments they must  be ranked among the highest Indians in America. There are over six  thousand Iroquois in New York, besides scattered bands in other  parts of the United States, and a still larger number in Canada;  thus illustrating the efficiency as well as persistency of the arts  of barbarous life in sustaining existence. It is, moreover, now  ascertained that they are slowly increasing.    When the confederacy was formed, about A. D. 1400-1450, the  conditions previously named were present. [Footnote: The Iroquois  claimed that it had existed from one hundred and fifty to two  hundred years when they first saw Europeans. The generations of  sachems in the history by David Cusick (a Tuscarora) would make it  more ancient. Schoolcraft's History, Condition and Prospects of the  Indian Tribes, 5, p. 631.]    The Iroquois were in five independent tribes, occupied territories  contiguous to each other, and spoke dialects of the same language  which were mutually intelligible. Beside these facts, certain gentes  were common in the several tribes, as has been shown. In their  relations to each other, as separated parts of the same gens, these  common gentes afforded a natural and enduring basis for a confederacy.  With these elements existing, the formation of a confederacy became  a question of intelligence and skill. Other tribes in large numbers  were standing in precisely the same relations in different parts of  the continent without confederating. The fact that the Iroquois  tribes accomplished the work affords evidence of their superior  capacity. Moreover, as the"]]]
