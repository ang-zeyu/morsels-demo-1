The Weimar  period, however, when the poet by means of a great and severe  self-discipline trains himself to the point of rigidity in order to  become the instrument of his art--that period is, with _Tasso_, paving  the way for the school of Grillparzer, while that infinite deepening  of the poetic calling is a preparation for Otto Ludwig, Richard  Wagner, and Friedrich Hebbel. The contemporary novel in the style of  _Wilhelm Meister_ is revived by the Young Germans, above all by  Gutzkow, in the same way that tendencies found in _Nathan_ and in  _Goetz_ are brought out again in Gutzkow's and in Heinrich Laube's  dramas, so rich in allusions. The national spirit of which _Egmont_ is  full also fills the novels of Willibald Alexis and Berthold Auerbach.  Finally those works, besides _Tasso_, which we are wont to consider  the crowning achievements of the Weimar period, above all,  _Iphigenia_, have permanently served as models of the new, and in  their way classical, \"antiques\"--for the Munich School, for the  Geibels and the Heyses. But we must also remember Moerike and Stifter,  and their absorption in the fullness of the inner life, which none of  them could attain to without somewhat stunting the growth of life's  realities--Hebbel perceived this clearly enough not only in Stifter  but in Goethe himself. Above all, however, this whole epoch of the  \"intellectual poets\" may, in a certain sense, be called the _Italian  Journey_ of German literature. Like Goethe in the years 1787-1788, the  German muse in this period only feels entirely at home in Italy, or at  least in the South; in her own country she feels misnamed.    Now let us consider Goethe after he had settled down in Weimar for the  second time. Scientific work seems for a while to have entirely  replaced poetic activity, as for a moment the scientific prose of  Ranke and Helmholtz came near to being of more consequence for the  German language than most of what was produced at the same time by  so-called poetry. Then the _Campaign in Champagne_ (1792), and the new  employment of his time with political problems, constitutes for Goethe  a temporary phase that may be compared with that recapturing of  history by political-historical writers like Freytag and Treitschke,  in the same way that _Hermann and Dorothea_ (1796), in which an old  historical anecdote of the time of the expulsion of the Protestants  from Salzburg is transplanted to the time of the French Revolution,  may be compared with the historical \"Novellen\" of Riehl, Scheffel, and  C.F. Meyer. Goethe's ballads (1797-1798) maintain the tradition that  was to be given new life by Fontane, Strachwitz, and C.F. Meyer.  Goethe's later novels with their didactic tendencies, and the  inclination to interpolate \"Novellen\" and diaries, lead up to  Gottfried Keller, Wilhelm Raabe and again to Fontane. The table-songs  and other convivial poetry of Goethe's old age are taken up again by  Scheffel; Goethe's \"Novellen\" themselves were continued by all those  eminent writers whom we have already named. The _Divan_, with its bent  toward immutable relations, prepares the way for the new lyric, until  finally, with the second part of _Faust_, mythical world-poetry and  symbolism complete the circle, just as the cycle of German literature  finishes with Nietzsche, Stefan George, Spitteler and Hofmannsthal. At  the same time new forces are starting to form the new cycle, or, to  speak like Goethe, the newest spiral: Hauptmann, Frenssen, Ricarda  Huch, Enrica von Handel, to name only these. And how many others have  we not previously left unnamed!    But all this has not been merely to exercise our ingenuity. By drawing  this parallel, which is naturally only to be taken approximately, we  have intended to make clear the comforting probability that, in spite  of all the exaggerating, narrowing down, and forcing to which it has  been obliged to submit, our modern and most recent German literature  is essentially a healthy literature. That, in spite of all deviation  caused by influential theorists--of the Storm and Stress, of the  Romantic School, of the period of Goethe's old age, of the epigonean  or naturalistic criticism, or by the dazzling phenomena of foreign  countries,--nevertheless in the essentials it obeys its own inner  laws. That in spite of all which in the present stage of our  literature may create a painful or confusing impression, _we have no  cause to doubt that a new and powerful upward development will take  place, and no cause either to underrate the literature of our own  day_! It is richer in great, and what is perhaps more important, in  serious talents than any other contemporary literature. No other can  show such wealth of material, no other such abundance of interesting  and, in part, entirely new productions. We do not say this in order to  disparage others who in some ways were, only a short time ago, so far  superior to us--as were the French in surety of form, the  Scandinavians in greatness of talents, the Russians in originality,  the English in cultivation of the general public; but we are inspired  to utter it by the hopeful joy which every one must feel who, in the  contemplation of our modern lyric poetry, our novels, dramas, epic and  didactic poetry, does not allow himself to be blinded by prejudice or  offended vanity. A great literature such as we possessed about 1800 we  of a certainty do not have to-day. A more hopeful chaos or one more  rich in fertile seeds we have not possessed since the days of  Romanticism. It is surely worth while to study this literature, and in  all its twists and turns to admire the heliotropism of the German  ideal and the importance which our German literature has won as a  mediator, an experimenter, and a model for that world-literature, the  outline of which the prophetic eye of the greatest German poet was the  first to discern, and his hand, equally expert in scientific and  poetic creation, the first to describe.        THE LIFE OF GOETHE    BY CALVIN THOMAS, LL.D.    Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures, Columbia University    Goethe, the illustrious poet-sage whom Matthew Arnold called the  \"clearest, largest, and most helpful thinker of modern times,\" was  born August 28, 1749, at Frankfurt on the Main.[2] He was christened  Johann Wolfgang. In his early years his familiar name was Wolfgang, or  simply Wolf, never Johann. His family was of the middle class, the  aristocratic _von_ which sometimes appears in his name, in accordance  with German custom, having come to him with a patent of nobility which  he received in the year 1782.    Johann Caspar Goethe, the poet's father, was the son of a prosperous  tailor, who was also a tailor's son. Having abundant means and being  of an ambitious turn, Johann Caspar prepared himself for the  profession of law, spent some time in Italy, and then settled in  Frankfurt in the hope of rising to distinction in the public service.  Disappointed in this hope, he procured the imperial title of  Councilor, which gave him a dignified social status but nothing in  particular to do. He thus became virtually a gentleman of leisure,  since his law practise was quite insignificant. In 1748 he married  Katharina Elisabeth Textor, whose father, Johann Wolfgang Textor, was  the town's chief magistrate and most eminent citizen. She was eighteen  years old at the time of her marriage--twenty years younger than her  husband--and well fitted to become a poet's mother. The gift on which  she especially prided herself was her story-telling. Wolfgang was the  first child of these parents.    The paternal strain in Goethe's blood made for level-headedness,  precise and methodical ways, a serious view of life, and a desire to  make the most of it. By his mother he was a poet who liked nothing  else so well as to invent dream-worlds and commune with the spirits of  his imagination. He also ascribes to his mother his _Frohnatur_, his  joyous nature. And certain it is that his temperament was on the whole  sunny. As he grew to manhood men and women alike were charmed by him.  He became a virtuoso in love and had a genius for friendship. But he  was not always cheerful. In his youth, particularly, he was often  moody and given to brooding over indefinable woes. He suffered acutely  at times from what is now called the melancholia of adolescence. This  was a phase of that emotional sensitiveness and nervous instability  which are nearly always a part of the poet's dower.    Wolfgang grew up in a wholesome atmosphere of comfort and refinement.  He never knew the tonic bitterness of poverty. On the other hand, he  was never spoiled by his advantages; to his dying day he disliked  luxury. At home under private tutors the boy studied Latin, French,  and English, and picked up a little Italian by overhearing his  sister's lessons. In 1758 Frankfurt was occupied by a French army, and  a French playhouse was set going for the diversion of the officers. In  the interest of his French Wolfgang was allowed to go to the theatre,  and he made such rapid progress that he was soon studying the dramatic  unities as expounded by Corneille and actually trying to write a  French play. Withal he was left much to himself, so that he had time  to explore Frankfurt to his heart's content.    [Illustration: JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE _From the painting by C.   Jaeger_]    He was much in contact with people of the humbler sort and learned to  like their racy dialect. He penetrated into the ghetto and learned the  jargon of the Jews. He even attacked biblical Hebrew, being led  thereto by his great love of the Old Testament.    It was his boyish ambition to become a great poet. His favorite  amusement was a puppet-show, for which he invented elaborate plays.  From his tenth year on he wrote a great deal of verse, early acquiring  technical facility and local renown and coming to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#9)"],[1,"we were only friends, you  understand. But we were on the footing of relatives, so there was  nothing out of the way in it. Reuben is a keen student of ancient and  mediaeval art, in which I also am much interested, so we used to visit  the museums and galleries together and get a great deal of pleasure from  comparing our views and impressions of what we saw.    \"About six months ago, Walter took me aside one day and, with a very  serious face, asked me if there was any kind of understanding between  Reuben and me. I thought it rather impertinent of him, but nevertheless,  I told him the truth, that Reuben and I were just friends and nothing  more.    \"'If that is the case,' said he, looking mighty grave, 'I would advise  you not to be seen about with him quite so much.'    \"'And why not?' I asked very naturally.    \"'Why, the fact is,' said Walter, 'that Reuben is a confounded fool. He  has been chattering to the men at the club and seems to have given them  the impression that a young lady of means and position has been setting  her cap at him very hard, but that he, being a high-souled philosopher  above the temptations that beset ordinary mortals, is superior both to  her blandishments and her pecuniary attractions. I give you the hint for  your own guidance,' he continued, 'and I expect this to go no farther.  You mustn't be annoyed with Reuben. The best of young men will often  behave like prigs and donkeys, and I have no doubt the fellows have  grossly exaggerated what he said; but I thought it right to put you on  your guard.'    \"Now this report, as you may suppose, made me excessively angry, and I  wanted to have it out with Reuben then and there. But Walter refused to  sanction this--'there was no use in making a scene' he said--and he  insisted that the caution was given to me in strict confidence; so what  was I to do? I tried to ignore it and treat Reuben as I always had done,  but this I found impossible; my womanly pride was much too deeply hurt.  And yet I felt it the lowest depth of meanness to harbour such thoughts  of him without giving him the opportunity to defend himself. And  although it was most unlike Reuben in some respects, it was very like  him in others; for he has always expressed the utmost contempt for men  who marry for a livelihood. So I have remained on the horns of a dilemma  and am there still. What do you think I ought to have done?\"    I rubbed my chin in some embarrassment at this question. Needless to  say, I was most disagreeably impressed by Walter Hornby's conduct, and  not a little disposed to blame my fair companion for giving an ear to  his secret disparagement of his cousin; but I was obviously not in a  position to pronounce, offhand, upon the merits of the case.    \"The position appears to be this,\" I said, after a pause, \"either Reuben  has spoken most unworthily and untruthfully of you, or Walter has lied  deliberately about him.\"    \"Yes,\" she agreed, \"that is the position; but which of the two  alternatives appears to you the more probable?\"    \"That is very difficult to say,\" I answered. \"There is a certain kind of  cad who is much given to boastful rhodomontade concerning his conquests.  We all know him and can generally spot him at first sight, but I must  say that Reuben Hornby did not strike me as that kind of man at all.  Then it is clear that the proper course for Walter to have adopted, if  he had really heard such rumours, was to have had the matter out with  Reuben, instead of coming secretly to you with whispered reports. That  is my feeling, Miss Gibson, but, of course, I may be quite wrong. I  gather that our two young friends are not inseparable companions?\"    \"Oh, they are very good friends, but you see, their interests and views  of life are quite different. Reuben, although an excellent worker in  business hours, is a student, or perhaps rather what one would call a  scholar, whereas Walter is more a practical man of affairs--decidedly  long-headed and shrewd. He is undoubtedly very clever, as Mrs. Hornby  said.\"    \"He takes photographs, for instance,\" I suggested.    \"Yes. But not ordinary amateur photographs; his work is more technical  and quite excellent of its kind. For example, he did a most beautiful  series of micro-photographs of sections of metalliferous rocks which he  reproduced for publication by the collotype process, and even printed  off the plates himself.\"    \"I see. He must be a very capable fellow.\"    \"He is, very,\" she assented, \"and very keen on making a position; but I  am afraid he is rather too fond of money for its own sake, which is not  a pleasant feature in a young man's character, is it?\"    I agreed that it was not.    \"Excessive keenness in money affairs,\" proceeded Miss Gibson oracularly,  \"is apt to lead a young man into bad ways--oh, you need not smile, Dr.  Jervis, at my wise saws; it is perfectly true, and you know it. The fact  is, I sometimes have an uneasy feeling that Walter's desire to be rich  inclines him to try what looks like a quick and easy method of making  money. He had a friend--a Mr. Horton--who is a dealer on the Stock  Exchange and who 'operates' rather largely--'operate' I believe is the  expression used, although it seems to be nothing more than common  gambling--and I have more than once suspected Walter of being concerned  in what Mr. Horton calls 'a little flutter.'\"    \"That doesn't strike me as a very long-headed proceeding,\" I remarked,  with the impartial wisdom of the impecunious, and therefore untempted.    \"No,\" she agreed, \"it isn't. But your gambler always thinks he is going  to win--though you mustn't let me give you the impression that Walter is  a gambler. But here is my destination. Thank you for escorting me so  far, and I hope you are beginning to feel less like a stranger to the  Hornby family. We shall make our appearance to-night at eight  punctually.\"    She gave me her hand with a frank smile and tripped up the steps leading  to the street door; and when I glanced back, after crossing the road,  she gave me a little friendly nod as she turned to enter the house.            CHAPTER V    THE 'THUMBOGRAPH'      \"So your net has been sweeping the quiet and pleasant waters of feminine  conversation,\" remarked Thorndyke when we met at the dinner table and I  gave him an outline of my afternoon's adventures.    \"Yes,\" I answered, \"and here is the catch cleaned and ready for the  consumer.\"    I laid on the table two of my notebooks in which I had entered such  facts as I had been able to extract from my talk with Miss Gibson.    \"You made your entries as soon as possible after your return, I  suppose?\" said Thorndyke--\"while the matter was still fresh?\"    \"I wrote down my notes as I sat on a seat in Kensington Gardens within  five minutes after leaving Miss Gibson.\"    \"Good!\" said Thorndyke. \"And now let us see what you have collected.\"    He glanced quickly through the entries in the two books, referring back  once or twice, and stood for a few moments silent and abstracted. Then  he laid the little books down on the table with a satisfied nod.    \"Our information, then,\" he said, \"amounts to this: Reuben is an  industrious worker at his business and, in his leisure, a student of  ancient and medieval art; possibly a babbling fool and a cad or, on the  other hand, a maligned and much-abused man.  \"Walter Hornby is  obviously a sneak and possibly a liar; a keen man of business, perhaps a  flutterer round the financial candle that burns in Throgmorton Street;  an expert photographer and a competent worker of the collotype process.  You have done a very excellent day's work, Jervis. I wonder if you see  the bearing of the facts that you have collected.\"    \"I think I see the bearing of some of them,\" I answered; \"at least, I  have formed certain opinions.\"    \"Then keep them to yourself, _mon ami_, so that I need not feel as if I  ought to unbosom myself of my own views.\"    \"I should be very much surprised if you did, Thorndyke,\" I replied, \"and  should have none the better opinion of you. I realise fully that your  opinions and theories are the property of your client and not to be used  for the entertainment of your friends.\"    Thorndyke patted me on the back playfully, but he looked uncommonly  pleased, and said, with evident sincerity, \"I am really grateful to you  for saying that, for I have felt a little awkward in being so reticent  with you who know so much of this case. But you are quite right, and I  am delighted to find you so discerning and sympathetic. The least I can  do under the circumstances is to uncork a bottle of Pommard, and drink  the health of so loyal and helpful a colleague. Ah! Praise the gods!  here is Polton, like a sacrificial priest accompanied by a sweet savour  of roasted flesh. Rump steak I ween,\" he added, sniffing, \"food meet for  the mighty Shamash (that pun was fortuitous, I need not say) or a  ravenous medical jurist. Can you explain to me, Polton, how it is that  your rump steak is better than any other steak? Is it that you have  command of a special brand of ox?\"    The little man's dry countenance wrinkled with pleasure until it was as  full of lines as a ground-plan of Clapham Junction.    \"Perhaps it is the special treatment it gets, sir,\" he replied. \"I  usually bruise it in the mortar before cooking, without breaking up the  fibre too much, and then I heat up the little cupel furnace to about 600  C, and put the steak in on a tripod.\"    Thorndyke laughed outright. \"The cupel furnace, too,\" he exclaimed.  \"Well, well, 'to what base uses'--but I don't know that it is a base use  after all. Anyhow, Polton, open a bottle of Pommard and put a couple of  ten by eight 'process' plates in your dark slides. I am expecting two  ladies here this evening with a document.\"    \"Shall you bring them upstairs, sir?\" inquired Polton, with an alarmed  expression.    \"I expect I shall have to,\" answered Thorndyke.    \"Then I shall "]]]
