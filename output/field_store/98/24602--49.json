He threw the ring on the flat ground, I went myself  and I lifted the ring, and I put it on my finger. When he said me then,  'Is the ring fitting thee?' I said to him, 'It is.' Then he said,  'Where art thou, ring?' And the ring said, 'I am here.' The brute went  and went towards where the ring was speaking, and now I saw that I was  in a harder case than ever I was. I drew a dirk. I cut the finger from  off me, and I threw it from me as far as I could out on the loch, and  there was a great depth in the place. He shouted, 'Where art thou,  ring?' And the ring said, 'I am here,' though it was on the bed of  ocean. He gave a spring after the ring, and out he went in the sea. And  I was as pleased then when I saw him drowning, as though you should  grant my own life and the life of my two sons with me, and not lay any  more trouble on me.    \"When the giant was drowned I went in, and I took with me all he had of  gold and silver, and I went home, and surely great joy was on my people  when I arrived. And as a sign now look, the finger is off me.\"    \"Yes, indeed, Conall, you are wordy and wise,\" said the king. \"I see  the finger is off you. You have freed your two sons, but tell me a case  in which you ever were that is harder than to be looking on your son  being hanged tomorrow, and you shall get the soul of your eldest son.\"    \"Then went my father,\" said Conall, \"and he got me a wife, and I was  married. I went to hunt. I was going beside the sea, and I saw an  island over in the midst of the loch, and I came there where a boat was  with a rope before her, and a rope behind her, and many precious things  within her. I looked myself on the boat to see how I might get part of  them. I put in the one foot, and the other foot was on the ground, and  when I raised my head what was it but the boat over in the middle of  the loch, and she never stopped till she reached the island. When I  went out of the boat the boat returned where she was before. I did not  know now what I should do. The place was without meat or clothing,  without the appearance of a house on it. I came out on the top of a  hill. Then I came to a glen; I saw in it, at the bottom of a hollow, a  woman with a child, and the child was naked on her knee, and she had a  knife in her hand. She tried to put the knife to the throat of the  babe, and the babe began to laugh in her face, and she began to cry,  and she threw the knife behind her. I thought to myself that I was near  my foe and far from my friends, and I called to the woman, 'What are  you doing here?' And she said to me, 'What brought you here?' I told  her myself word upon word how I came. 'Well then,' said she, 'it was so  I came also.' She showed me to the place where I should come in where  she was. I went in, and I said to her, 'What was the matter that you  were putting the knife on the neck of the child?' 'It is that he must  be cooked for the giant who is here, or else no more of my world will  be before me.' Just then we could be hearing the footsteps of the  giant, 'What shall I do? what shall I do?' cried the woman. I went to  the caldron, and by luck it was not hot, so in it I got just as the  brute came in. 'Hast thou boiled that youngster for me?' he cried.  'He's not done yet,' said she, and I cried out from the caldron,  'Mammy, mammy, it's boiling I am.' Then the giant laughed out HAI, HAW,  HOGARAICH, and heaped on wood under the caldron.    \"And now I was sure I would scald before I could get out of that. As  fortune favoured me, the brute slept beside the caldron. There I was  scalded by the bottom of the caldron. When she perceived that he was  asleep, she set her mouth quietly to the hole that was in the lid, and  she said to me 'was I alive?' I said I was. I put up my head, and the  hole in the lid was so large, that my head went through easily.  Everything was coming easily with me till I began to bring up my hips.  I left the skin of my hips behind me, but I came out. When I got out of  the caldron I knew not what to do; and she said to me that there was no  weapon that would kill him but his own weapon. I began to draw his  spear and every breath that he drew I thought I would be down his  throat, and when his breath came out I was back again just as far. But  with every ill that befell me I got the spear loosed from him. Then I  was as one under a bundle of straw in a great wind for I could not  manage the spear. And it was fearful to look on the brute, who had but  one eye in the midst of his face; and it was not agreeable for the like  of me to attack him. I drew the dart as best I could, and I set it in  his eye. When he felt this he gave his head a lift, and he struck the  other end of the dart on the top of the cave, and it went through to  the back of his head. And he fell cold dead where he was; and you may  be sure, oh king, that joy was on me. I myself and the woman went out  on clear ground, and we passed the night there. I went and got the boat  with which I came, and she was no way lightened, and took the woman and  the child over on dry land; and I returned home.\"    The king of Lochlann's mother was putting on a fire at this time, and  listening to Conall telling the tale about the child.    \"Is it you,\" said she, \"that were there?\"    \"Well then,\" said he, \"'twas I.\"    \"Och! och!\" said she, \"'twas I that was there, and the king is the  child whose life you saved; and it is to you that life thanks should be  given.\" Then they took great joy.    The king said, \"Oh, Conall, you came through great hardships. And now  the brown horse is yours, and his sack full of the most precious things  that are in my treasury.\"    They lay down that night, and if it was early that Conall rose, it was  earlier than that that the queen was on foot making ready. He got the  brown horse and his sack full of gold and silver and stones of great  price, and then Conall and his three sons went away, and they returned  home to the Erin realm of gladness. He left the gold and silver in his  house, and he went with the horse to the king. They were good friends  evermore. He returned home to his wife, and they set in order a feast;  and that was a feast if ever there was one, oh son and brother.        HUDDEN AND DUDDEN AND DONALD O'NEARY    There was once upon a time two farmers, and their names were Hudden and  Dudden. They had poultry in their yards, sheep on the uplands, and  scores of cattle in the meadow-land alongside the river. But for all  that they weren't happy. For just between their two farms there lived a  poor man by the name of Donald O'Neary. He had a hovel over his head  and a strip of grass that was barely enough to keep his one cow, Daisy,  from starving, and, though she did her best, it was but seldom that  Donald got a drink of milk or a roll of butter from Daisy. You would  think there was little here to make Hudden and Dudden jealous, but so  it is, the more one has the more one wants, and Donald's neighbours lay  awake of nights scheming how they might get hold of his little strip of  grass-land. Daisy, poor thing, they never thought of; she was just a  bag of bones.    One day Hudden met Dudden, and they were soon grumbling as usual, and  all to the tune of \"If only we could get that vagabond Donald O'Neary  out of the country.\"    \"Let's kill Daisy,\" said Hudden at last; \"if that doesn't make him  clear out, nothing will.\"    No sooner said than agreed, and it wasn't dark before Hudden and Dudden  crept up to the little shed where lay poor Daisy trying her best to  chew the cud, though she hadn't had as much grass in the day as would  cover your hand. And when Donald came to see if Daisy was all snug for  the night, the poor beast had only time to lick his hand once before  she died.    Well, Donald was a shrewd fellow, and downhearted though he was, began  to think if he could get any good out of Daisy's death. He thought and  he thought, and the next day you could have seen him trudging off early  to the fair, Daisy's hide over his shoulder, every penny he had  jingling in his pockets. Just before he got to the fair, he made  several slits in the hide, put a penny in each slit, walked into the  best inn of the town as bold as if it belonged to him, and, hanging the  hide up to a nail in the wall, sat down.    \"Some of your best whisky,\" says he to the landlord.    But the landlord didn't like his looks. \"Is it fearing I won't pay you,  you are?\" says Donald; \"why I have a hide here that gives me all the  money I want.\" And with that he hit it a whack with his stick and out  hopped a penny. The landlord opened his eyes, as you may fancy.    \"What'll you take for that hide?\"    \"It's not for sale, my good man.\"    \"Will you take a gold piece?\"    \"It's not for sale, I tell you. Hasn't it kept me and mine for years?\"  and with that Donald hit the hide another whack and out jumped a second  penny.    Well, the long and the short of it was that Donald let the hide go,  and, that very evening, who but he should walk up to Hudden's door?    \"Good-evening, Hudden. Will you lend me your best pair of scales?\"    Hudden stared and Hudden scratched his head, but he lent the scales.    When Donald was safe at home, he pulled out his pocketful of bright  gold and began to weigh each piece in the scales. But Hudden had put a  lump of butter at the bottom, and so the last piece of gold stuck fast  to the scales when he took them back to Hudden.    If Hudden had stared before, he stared ten times more now, and no  sooner was Donald's back turned, than he was of as hard as he could  pelt to Dudden's.    \"Good-evening, Dudden. That vagabond, bad luck to him--\"    \"You mean Donald O'Neary?\"    \"And who else should I mean? He's back here weighing out sackfuls of  gold.\"    \"How do you know that?\"    \"Here are my scales that he borrowed, and here's a gold piece still  sticking to them.\"    Off they went together, and they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7896"],[0,"The Eight Strokes of the Clock (#8)"],[1,"bedroom and returned with  a bottle of water, of which he took a few sips, afterwards placing the  bottle on the window-sill:    \"Come along,\" he said.    Prince Renine chuckled.    \"You seem to be in a hurry to leave the place.\"    \"I'm in a hurry to show you up,\" retorted Dutreuil, slamming the door.    They went downstairs to the private room containing the telephone. The room  was empty. Renine asked Gaston Dutreuil for the Aubrieuxs' number, took  down the instrument and was put through.    The maid who came to the telephone answered that Madame Aubrieux had  fainted, after giving way to an access of despair, and that she was now  asleep.    \"Fetch her mother, please. Prince Renine speaking. It's urgent.\"    He handed the second receiver to Morisseau. For that matter, the voices  were so distinct that Dutreuil and Hortense were able to hear every word  exchanged.    \"Is that you, madame?\"    \"Yes. Prince Renine, I believe?\"    \"Prince Renine.\"    \"Oh, sir, what news have you for me? Is there any hope?\" asked the old  lady, in a tone of entreaty.    \"The enquiry is proceeding very satisfactorily,\" said Renine, \"and you  may hope for the best. For the moment, I want you to give me some very  important particulars. On the day of the murder, did Gaston Dutreuil come  to your house?\"    \"Yes, he came to fetch my daughter and myself, after lunch.\"    \"Did he know at the time that M. Guillaume had sixty thousand francs at his  place?\"    \"Yes, I told him.\"    \"And that Jacques Aubrieux was not feeling very well and was proposing not  to take his usual cycle-ride but to stay at home and sleep?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You are sure?\"    \"Absolutely certain.\"    \"And you all three went to the cinema together?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you were all sitting together?\"    \"Oh, no! There was no room. He took a seat farther away.\"    \"A seat where you could see him?\"    \"No.\"    \"But he came to you during the interval?\"    \"No, we did not see him until we were going out.\"    \"There is no doubt of that?\"    \"None at all.\"    \"Very well, madame. I will tell you the result of my efforts in an hour's  time. But above all, don't wake up Madame Aubrieux.\"    \"And suppose she wakes of her own accord?\"    \"Reassure her and give her confidence. Everything is going well, very well  indeed.\"    He hung up the receiver and turned to Dutreuil, laughing:    \"Ha, ha, my boy! Things are beginning to look clearer. What do you say?\"    It was difficult to tell what these words meant or what conclusions Renine  had drawn from his conversation. The silence was painful and oppressive.    \"Mr. Chief-Inspector, you have some of your men outside, haven't you?\"    \"Two detective-sergeants.\"    \"It's important that they should be there. Please also ask the manager not  to disturb us on any account.\"    And, when Morisseau returned, Renine closed the door, took his stand in  front of Dutreuil and, speaking in a good-humoured but emphatic tone, said:    \"It amounts to this, young man, that the ladies saw nothing of you between  three and five o'clock on that Sunday. That's rather a curious detail.\"    \"A perfectly natural detail,\" Dutreuil retorted, \"and one, moreover, which  proves nothing at all.\"    \"It proves, young man, that you had a good two hours at your disposal.\"    \"Obviously. Two hours which I spent at the cinema.\"    \"Or somewhere else.\"    Dutreuil looked at him:    \"Somewhere else?\"    \"Yes. As you were free, you had plenty of time to go wherever you liked ...  to Suresnes, for instance.\"    \"Oh!\" said the young man, jesting in his turn. \"Suresnes is a long way  off!\"    \"It's quite close! Hadn't you your friend Jacques Aubrieux's motor-cycle?\"    A fresh pause followed these words. Dutreuil had knitted his brows as  though he were trying to understand. At last he was heard to whisper:    \"So that is what he was trying to lead up to!... The brute!...\"    Renine brought down his hand on Dutreuil's shoulder:    \"No more talk! Facts! Gaston Dutreuil, you are the only person who on that  day knew two essential things: first, that Cousin Guillaume had sixty  thousand francs in his house; secondly, that Jacques Aubrieux was not  going out. You at once saw your chance. The motor-cycle was available. You  slipped out during the performance. You went to Suresnes. You killed Cousin  Guillaume. You took the sixty bank-notes and left them at your rooms. And  at five o'clock you went back to fetch the ladies.\"    Dutreuil had listened with an expression at once mocking and flurried,  casting an occasional glance at Inspector Morisseau as though to enlist  him as a witness:    \"The man's mad,\" it seemed to say. \"It's no use being angry with him.\"    When Renine had finished, he began to laugh:    \"Very funny!... A capital joke!... So it was I whom the neighbours saw  going and returning on the motor-cycle?\"    \"It was you disguised in Jacques Aubrieux's clothes.\"    \"And it was my finger-prints that were found on the bottle in M.  Guillaume's pantry?\"    \"The bottle had been opened by Jacques Aubrieux at lunch, in his own house,  and it was you who took it with you to serve as evidence.\"    \"Funnier and funnier!\" cried Dutreuil, who had the air of being frankly  amused. \"Then I contrived the whole affair so that Jacques Aubrieux might  be accused of the crime?\"    \"It was the safest means of not being accused yourself.\"    \"Yes, but Jacques is a friend whom I have known from childhood.\"    \"You're in love with his wife.\"    The young man gave a sudden, infuriated start:    \"You dare!... What! You dare make such an infamous suggestion?\"    \"I have proof of it.\"    \"That's a lie! I have always respected Madeleine Aubrieux and revered  her....\"    \"Apparently. But you're in love with her. You desire her. Don't contradict  me. I have abundant proof of it.\"    \"That's a lie, I tell you! You have only known me a few hours!\"    \"Come, come! I've been quietly watching you for days, waiting for the  moment to pounce upon you.\"    He took the young man by the shoulders and shook him:    \"Come, Dutreuil, confess! I hold all the proofs in my hand. I have  witnesses whom we shall meet presently at the criminal investigation  department. Confess, can't you? In spite of everything, you're tortured  by remorse. Remember your dismay, at the restaurant, when you had seen  the newspaper. What? Jacques Aubrieux condemned to die? That's more than  you bargained for! Penal servitude would have suited your book; but the  scaffold!... Jacques Aubrieux executed to-morrow, an innocent man!...  Confess, won't you? Confess to save your own skin! Own up!\"    Bending over the other, he was trying with all his might to extort a  confession from him. But Dutreuil drew himself up and coldly, with a sort  of scorn in his voice, said:    \"Sir, you are a madman. Not a word that you have said has any sense in it.  All your accusations are false. What about the bank-notes? Did you find  them at my place as you said you would?\"    Renine, exasperated, clenched his fist in his face:    \"Oh, you swine, I'll dish you yet, I swear I will!\"    He drew the inspector aside:    \"Well, what do you say to it? An arrant rogue, isn't he?\"    The inspector nodded his head:    \"It may be.... But, all the same ... so far there's no real evidence.\"    \"Wait, M. Morisseau,\" said Renine. \"Wait until we've had our interview with  M. Dudouis. For we shall see M. Dudouis at the prefecture, shall we not?\"    \"Yes, he'll be there at three o'clock.\"    \"Well, you'll be convinced, Mr. Inspector! I tell you here and now that you  will be convinced.\"    Renine was chuckling like a man who feels certain of the course of events.  Hortense, who was standing near him and was able to speak to him without  being heard by the others, asked, in a low voice:    \"You've got him, haven't you?\"    He nodded his head in assent:    \"Got him? I should think I have! All the same, I'm no farther forward than  I was at the beginning.\"    \"But this is awful! And your proofs?\"    \"Not the shadow of a proof ... I was hoping to trip him up. But he's kept  his feet, the rascal!\"    \"Still, you're certain it's he?\"    \"It can't be any one else. I had an intuition at the very outset; and I've  not taken my eyes off him since. I have seen his anxiety increasing as my  investigations seemed to centre on him and concern him more closely. Now I  know.\"    \"And he's in love with Madame Aubrieux?\"    \"In logic, he's bound to be. But so far we have only hypothetical  suppositions, or rather certainties which are personal to myself. We shall  never intercept the guillotine with those. Ah, if we could only find the  bank-notes! Given the bank-notes, M. Dudouis would act. Without them, he  will laugh in my face.\"    \"What then?\" murmured Hortense, in anguished accents.    He did not reply. He walked up and down the room, assuming an air of gaiety  and rubbing his hands. All was going so well! It was really a treat to take  up a case which, so to speak, worked itself out automatically.    \"Suppose we went on to the prefecture, M. Morisseau? The chief must be  there by now. And, having gone so far, we may as well finish. Will M.  Dutreuil come with us?\"    \"Why not?\" said Dutreuil, arrogantly.    But, just as Renine was opening the door, there was a noise in the passage  and the manager ran up, waving his arms:    \"Is M. Dutreuil still here?... M. Dutreuil, your flat is on fire!... A man  outside told us. He saw it from the square.\"    The young man's eyes lit up. For perhaps half a second his mouth was  twisted by a smile which Renine noticed:    \"Oh, you ruffian!\" he cried. \"You've given yourself away, my beauty! It was  you who set fire to the place upstairs; and now the notes are burning.\"    He blocked his exit.    \"Let me pass,\" shouted Dutreuil. \"There's a fire and no one can get in,  because no one else has a key. Here it is. Let me pass, damn it!\"    Renine snatched the key from his hand and, holding him by the collar of his  coat:    \"Don't you move, "]]]
