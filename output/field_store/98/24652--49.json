In a few of the shops may be had keshre, made from the skin of the  bean, which is scarcely inferior in flavour to that made from the bean  itself. One of the shops is frequented by those who smoke the hashysh,  or a preparation of hemp-flowers mixed with tobacco, which produces a  kind of intoxication. Hashysh is still more used in Egypt, especially  among the peasants. [Of the hemp-flowers, they use for this purpose the  small leaves standing round the seed, (called sheranek.) The common  people put a small quantity of them upon the top of the tobacco with  which their pipes are filled. The higher classes eat it in a jelly or  paste (maadjoun) made in the following manner:--a quantity of the  leaves is boiled with butter for several hours, and then put under a  press; the juice so expressed is mixed with honey and other sweet drugs,  and publicly sold in Egypt, where shops are kept for that purpose. The  Hashysh paste is politely termed bast, and those who sell it basty (i.e.  cheerfulness). On the occasion of a festival to celebrate the marriage  of a son of one of the principal grandees at Cairo, when all the  different crafts of the town were represented in a showy procession, the  basty, although exercising a business prohibited and condemned by the  law, was among the most gaudy. Many persons of the first rank use the  bast in some shape or other; it exhilarates the spirits, and raises the  imagination as violently as opium. Some persons also mix the paste with  seeds of the Bendj, which comes from Syria.]    In all these shops the Persian pipe is smoked, of which there    [p.26] are three different sorts. 1. The Kedra, which is the largest,  and rests upon a tripod; it is always neatly worked, and found only in  private houses. 2. The Shishe (called in Syria Argyle), of a smaller  size, but, like the former, joined to a long serpentine tube (called  lieh), through which the smoke is inhaled. 3. The Bury. This consists of  an unpolished cocoa-nut shell, which contains water; a thick reed  answers the purpose of the serpentine tube: this pipe is the constant  companion of the lower classes, and of all the sailors of the Red Sea,  who indulge most inordinately in using it. The tobacco smoked in the two  former of these pipes comes from the Persian gulf; the best is from  Shiraz. An inferior sort (called tombak) comes from Basra and Baghdad;  the leaf is of a light yellow colour, and much stronger in taste than  common tobacco; it is, therefore, previously washed to render it milder.  The tombak used in the Bury comes from Yemen, and is of the same species  as the other, but of an inferior quality. The trade in this article is  very considerable, its consumption in the Hedjaz being almost incredibly  great; large quantities are also shipped for Egypt. The common pipe is  little used in the Hedjaz, except by Turkish soldiers and Bedouins. The  tobacco is of Egyptian growth, or from Sennar, whence it is carried to  Sowakin. Very little good Syrian tobacco finds its way across the Red  Sea.    The coffee-houses are filled with people during the whole day; and in  front a shed is generally erected, under which persons also sit. The  rooms, benches, and small low chairs, are very filthy, and form a  contrast to the neatness and elegance observable in the coffee-houses of  Damascus. Respectable merchants are never seen in a coffee-house; but  those of the third class, and sea-faring people, make it their constant  resort. Every person has his particular house, where he meets those who  have business with him. An Arab, who cannot afford to ask his friend to  dine, invites him from the coffee-house, when he sees him pass, to enter  and take    [p.27] a cup, and is highly offended if the invitation be rejected. When  his friend enters, he orders the waiter to bring him a cup, and the  waiter, in presenting it, exclaims aloud, so that every one in the place  may hear him, djebba! (gratis). An Arab may cheat his creditors, or be  guilty of bad faith in his dealings, and yet escape public censure; but  he would be covered with infamy, if it were known that he had attempted  to cheat the coffee-house waiter of his due. The Turkish soldiers have  done their utmost in this respect to increase the contempt in which they  are held by the Arabs. I never saw in the coffee-houses of the Hedjaz  any of those story-tellers who are so common in Egypt, and still more in  Syria. The Mangal [See Niebuhrs Travels.] is generally played in all of  them, and the Dama, a kind of draughts, differing somewhat from the  European game; but I never happened to see chess played in the Hedjaz,  though I heard that it is not uncommon, and that the sherifs in  particular are fond of it.    Near to almost every coffee-shop a person takes his stand, who sells  cooled water in small perfumed jars. [The Orientals often drink water  before coffee, but never immediately after. I was once recognised in  Syria as a foreigner or European, in consequence of having called for  water just after I had taken coffee. If you were of this country ,  said the waiter, you would not spoil the taste of the coffee in your  mouth by washing it away with water.]    Twenty-one butter-sellers, who likewise retail honey, oil, and vinegar.  Butter forms the chief article in Arab cookery, which is more greasy  than even that of Italy. Fresh butter, called by the Arabs zebde, is  very rarely seen in the Hedjaz. It is a common practice amongst all  classes to drink every morning a coffee-cup full of melted butter or  ghee, after which coffee is taken. They regard it as a powerful tonic,  and are so much accustomed to it from their earliest youth, that they  would feel great inconvenience in discontinuing the use of it. The  higher classes content themselves    [p.28] with drinking the quantity of butter, but the lower orders add a  half-cup more, which they snuff up their nostrils, conceiving that they  prevent foul air from entering the body by that channel. The practice is  universal as well with the inhabitants of the town as with the Bedouins.  The lower classes are likewise in the habit of rubbing their breasts,  shoulders, arms, and legs, with butter, as the negroes do, to refresh  the skin. During the war, the import of this article from the interior  had almost entirely ceased; but even in time of peace, it is not  sufficient for the consumption of Djidda; some is, therefore, brought  also from Sowakin; but the best sort, and that which is in greatest  plenty, comes from Massowah, and is called here Dahlak butter: whole  ships cargoes arrive from thence, the greater part of which is again  carried to Mekka. Butter is likewise imported from Cosseir; this comes  from Upper Egypt, and is made from buffaloes milk; the Sowakin and  Dahlak ghee is from sheeps milk.    The Hedjaz abounds with honey in every part of the mountains. The best  comes from those which are inhabited by the Nowaszera Bedouins, to the  south of Tayf. Among the lower classes, a common breakfast is a mixture  of ghee and honey poured over crumbs of bread as they come quite hot  from the oven. The Arabs, who are very fond of paste, never eat it  without honey.    The oil used for lamps is that of Sesamum (Seeredj, brought from Egypt).  The Arabs do not use oil for culinary purposes, except in frying fish,  or with broken paste to be given to the poor. Salad, of which the  northern Turks are so fond, is never seen on an Arabian table.    Eighteen vegetable or fruit-stands. The number of these has now greatly  increased, on account of the Turkish troops, who are great devourers of  vegetables. All the fruits come from Tayf, behind Mekka, which is rich  in gardens. I found here in July grapes of the best kind, with which the  mountains behind Mekka    [p.29] abound; pomegranates of middling quality; quinces, which have not  the harsh taste of those in Europe, and may be eaten raw; peaches;  lemons of the smallest size only, like those of Cairo; bitter oranges;  bananas--these do not grow at Tayf, but are brought by the Medina road  principally from Safra, Djedeyda, and Kholeys. These fruits last till  November. In March, water melons are brought from Wady Fatmé, which are  said to be small, but of a good flavour. The Arabs eat little fruit  except grapes; they say it produces bile, and occasions flatulency, in  which they are probably not mistaken. The fruit sold at Djidda is  particularly unwholesome; for having been packed up at Tayf in an unripe  state, it acquires a factitious maturity by fermentation during the  journey. The Turks quarrel and fight every morning before the shops, in  striving to get the fruits, which are in small quantities and very dear.  Vegetables are brought to Djidda from Wady Fatmé, six or eight miles  distant to the north, which also supplies Mekka. The usual kinds are  Meloukhye, Bamye, Portulaca egg-plants, or Badingans, cucumbers, and  very small turnips, of which the leaves are eaten, and the root is  thrown away as useless. Radishes and leeks are the only vegetables  regularly and daily used in Arab cookery; they are very small, and the  common people eat them raw with bread. In general, the Arabs consume  very few vegetables, their dishes being made of meat, rice, flour, and  butter. In these fruit-shops, tamarind (called here Homar) is also sold;  it comes from the East Indies, not in cakes, like that from the negro  countries, but in its natural form, though much decomposed. When boiled  in water, it constitutes a refreshing beverage, and is given to sick  people boiled with meat into a stew.    Eight date-sellers. Of all eatables used by the Arabs, dates are the  most favourite; and they have many traditions from their prophet,  showing the pre-eminence of dates above all other kinds of food. The  importation of dates is uninterrupted during the whole year.

Careless \"Papa Charles\" made but little money, and saved none; all the  economy and planning of thrifty \"Mamma Letitia\" did not keep things from  falling behind, and even the help of Uncle Lucien the canon was not  sufficient.    Charles Bonaparte had gained but little by his submission to the French.  The people in power flattered him, and gave him office and titles, but  these brought in no money; and yet, because of his position, he was  forced to entertain and be hospitable to the French officers in Corsica.    Now, this all took money; and there was but little money in the  Bonaparte house to take. So, at last, after much discussion between the  father and mother,--the father urging and the mother objecting,--the  Bonapartes decided to sell a field to raise money; and you can  scarcely understand how bitter a thing this is to a Corsican. To part  with a piece of land is, to him, like cutting off an arm. It hurts.    Napoleon heard all of these discussions, and was sadly aware of the  poverty of his home. He worried over it; he wished he could know how to  help his mother in her struggles; and he looked forward, more earnestly  than ever, to the day when he should be a man, or should at least be  able to do something toward helping out in his home.    At last things took a turn. Old King Louis of France was dead; young  King Louis--the sixteenth of the name--sat on the throne. There was  trouble in the kingdom. There was a struggle between the men who wished  to better things and those who wished things to stay as they were. Among  these latter were the governors of the French provinces or departments.  In order to have things fixed to suit themselves, they selected men to  represent them in the nation's assembly at Paris.    The governor of Corsica was one of these men; and by flattery and  promises he won over to his side Papa Charles Bonaparte, and had him  sent to Paris (or rather to Versailles, where the assembly met, not far  from Paris) as a delegate from the nobility of Corsica. This sounded  very fine; but the truth is, \"Papa Charles\" was simply nothing more  than \"the governor's man,\" to do as he told him, and to work in his  interests.    One result of this, however, was that it made things a little easier for  the Bonapartes; and it gave them the opportunity of giving to the two  older boys, Joseph and Napoleon, an education in France at the expense  of the state.    So when Charles Bonaparte was ready to sail to his duties in France, it  was arranged that he should take with him Joseph, Napoleon, and Uncle  Joey Fesch. Joseph was now eleven years old; Napoleon was nine, and  Uncle Joey was fifteen.    Joseph and Uncle Joey were to be educated as priests; Napoleon was to go  to the military school at Brienne. But, at first, both the brothers were  sent to a sort of preparatory school at Autun.    Napoleon was delighted. He was to go out into the world. He was to be  a man; and yet, when the time came, he hated to leave his home. He was  fond of his family; indeed, his life was largely given up to remembering  and helping his mother and brothers and sisters. He regretted leaving  his dear grotto; he was sorry to say good-by to Panoria--his favorite  \"La Giacommetta.\" But his future had been decided upon by his father  and mother, and he promised to do great things for them when he was old  enough to be a captain in the army--even if it were the army of France.  For, you see, he was still so earnest a Corsican patriot, that he wished  rather to free Corsica than to defend France.    \"Who knows?\" he boasted one day to Panoria; \"perhaps I will become a  colonel, and come back here and be a greater man than Paoli. Perhaps I  may free Corsica. What would you think of that, Panoria?\"    \"I should think it funny for a boy who went to school in France to come  away and fight France,\" said practical Panoria.    But Napoleon would not see it in this way. He dreamed of glory, and  believed he would yet be able to strike a blow for the freedom of  Corsica. At last the day of departure arrived. There was a lingering  leave-taking and a sorrowful one. For the first time, the Bonaparte boys  were leaving their mother and their home.    \"Be good boys,\" she said to them; \"learn all you can, and try to be  a credit to your family. Upon you we look for help in the future. Be  thrifty, be saving, do not get sick, and remember that, upon your work  now, will depend your success in life.\"    \"Good-bye!\" cried Nurse Saveria. \"When you come back I will have for you  the biggest basket of fruit we can pick in the garden of your uncle the  canon.\"    \"That you shall, boy,\" said Uncle Lucien, slipping his last piece of  pocket-money into Napoleon's hand. \"And take you this, for luck. You  will do your best, I know you will, and you'll come back to us a great  man. Don't forget your Uncle Lucien, you boy, when you are famous, will  you?\"    Napoleon smiled through his tears, and made a laughing promise in reply  to his uncle's laughing demand. But, for all the fun of the remark,  there was yet a strong groundwork of belief beneath this assertion of  the Canon Lucien Bonaparte; the old man was a shrewd observer. His  friendship for the little Napoleon was strong. And in spite of all  the boy's faults,--his temper, his ambition, his sullenness, his  carelessness, and his selfishness,--Uncle Lucien still recognized in  this nine-year-old nephew an ability that would carry him forward as he  grew older.    \"Napoleon has his faults,\" he said, in talking over family matters  with Mamma Letitia and Papa Charles the night before the departure for  France; \"the boy is not perfect--what child is? But those very faults  will grow into action as he becomes acquainted with the world. I expect  great things of the boy; and mark my words, Letitia and Charles, it is  of no use for you to think on Napoleon's fortune or his future. He will  make them for himself, and you will look to him for assistance, rather  than he to you. Joseph is the eldest son; but, of this I am sure,  Napoleon will be the head of this family. Remember what I say; for,  though I may not live to see it, some of you will--and will profit by  it.\"    They were all on the dock as the vessel sailed away, bearing Papa  Charles, Uncle Joey Fesch, and the two Bonaparte boys, from Ajaccio to  Florence.    Mamma Letitia was there, tearful, but smiling, with Eliza, and Pauline,  and Baby Lucien; so were Uncle Lucien the canon, and Aunt Manuccia,  who had been their mother's housekeeper, with Nurse Saveria, and Nurse  Ilaria, whom Napoleon called foster-mother, and even little Panoria, to  whom Napoleon cried \"Good-by, Giacommeta mia! I'll come back some day.\"    Then the vessel moved out into the harbor, and sailed away for Italy,  while the tearful group on the dock and the tearful group on the deck  threw kisses to one another until they could no longer make out faces or  forms.    The home tie was broken; and Napoleon Bonaparte, a boy of nine and a  half years, was launched upon life--a life the world was never to  forget.          CHAPTER EIGHT.    AT THE PREPARATORY SCHOOL.    The Bonaparte boys and their father stopped a while in Florence, so that  Charles Bonaparte could procure the proper papers to prove that he was  of what is called noble birth. For it seems that only the children of  nobles could enter the French military school at Brienne.    He procured these at last, and also a letter of introduction to the  French queen, Marie Antoinette whose sad story you all know so well.    Then they set out for Autun, and reached that quaint old town on the  last day of the year 1778. On New Year's Day, 1779, Napoleon was entered  as a pupil in the preparatory school at Autun.    Autun has been a school town tor hundreds of years. The old Druids had a  school there, and so did the Romans. It is one of the oldest of French  towns; and you will find it on your map of France, about one hundred and  fifty miles south-east of Paris. It is a picturesque old town, placed  on a sloping hillside, that runs down to the Arroux River. There is  a cathedral in the town over nine hundred years old; and there, too,  Napoleon found a college and a seminary, a museum and a library, with  plenty of ruins, walls, and gateways, and such things, that told of its  great age and old-time grandeur.    It was a fine place in which to go to school, and the Bonaparte boys  must have found it quite a change from their Corsican home. The bishop  of Autun, who had charge of the cathedral and the schools, was the  nephew of a friend of Charles Bonaparte, and he promised to look after  the boys.    Napoleon did not stay long in the school at Autun. His father went to  Paris to enter upon his duties as delegate to the Assembly, intending,  while there, to make arrangements for getting Napoleon into the military  school at Brienne.    But there was much need of the preparatory work at Autun. For you must  know that, being a Corsican, Napoleon knew scarcely a word of French.  The Corsicans speak Italian, and this would never do for a French  schoolboy. So, for three months, Napoleon was drilled in French.    He did not take kindly to it. But he did his best. For, you see, his  journey from Florence to Marseilles, and on to Autun, had opened his  eyes. He saw, for the first time, cities larger than Ajaccio, and  learned that there were other places in the world besides Corsica.    But he never really lost his Ajaccio tongue, and for most of his life he  talked French with an Italian accent.    It was a queer-looking little Italian boy who was thus studying French  at Autun school. You would scarcely have looked at him twice; for his  figure was small, his appearance insignificant, his face sober and  solemn, his hair stiff and stringy, and his complexion sallow. The boys  made fun of the way in which he talked, as boys are apt to make sport of  those who do not talk as they do. "]]]
