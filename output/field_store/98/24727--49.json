El fango, de que digo que está compuesto este parage, es tan suelto,  especialmente por las orillas de los arroyos, que un perro que en una  ocasion saltò del bote, y nadando salió al expresado fango, tuvimos  que ir con el mismo bote à buscarle, porque luego que se clavò ya no  pudo salir.    Algunos de los marineros que llevè se han visto en bastante riesgo de  perder la vida, queriendo hacer pruebas à veces à pasar algun pantano  ó arroyo, que por casi seco les parecia chico.    Y ùltimamente, siempre que este puerto tenga salida libre á la mar,  como con bastante fundamento lo presumo, vuelvo à decir, que me parece  solamente bueno para la nacion que ocupe el Colorado.

Mr. Tyrrel thought there would be no end to the  commendation; and expected when their common acquaintance would fall  down and adore the intruder. The most inadvertent expression of applause  inflicted upon him the torment of demons. He writhed with agony, his  features became distorted, and his looks inspired terror. Such suffering  would probably have soured the kindest temper; what must have been its  effect upon Mr. Tyrrel's, always fierce, unrelenting, and abrupt?    The advantages of Mr. Falkland seemed by no means to diminish with their  novelty. Every new sufferer from Mr. Tyrrel's tyranny immediately went  over to the standard of his adversary. The ladies, though treated by  their rustic swain with more gentleness than the men, were occasionally  exposed to his capriciousness and insolence. They could not help  remarking the contrast between these two leaders in the fields of  chivalry, the one of whom paid no attention to any one's pleasure but  his own, while the other seemed all good-humour and benevolence. It was  in vain that Mr. Tyrrel endeavoured to restrain the ruggedness of his  character. His motive was impatience, his thoughts were gloomy, and his  courtship was like the pawings of an elephant. It appeared as if his  temper had been more human while he indulged in its free bent, than now  that he sullenly endeavoured to put fetters upon its excesses.    Among the ladies of the village-assembly already mentioned, there was  none that seemed to engage more of the kindness of Mr. Tyrrel than Miss  Hardingham. She was also one of the few that had not yet gone over to  the enemy, either because she really preferred the gentleman who was her  oldest acquaintance, or that she conceived from calculation this conduct  best adapted to insure her success in a husband. One day, however, she  thought proper, probably only by way of experiment, to show Mr. Tyrrel  that she could engage in hostilities, if he should at any time give her  sufficient provocation. She so adjusted her manoeuvres as to be engaged  by Mr. Falkland as his partner for the dance of the evening, though  without the smallest intention on the part of that gentleman (who was  unpardonably deficient in the sciences of anecdote and match-making) of  giving offence to his country neighbour. Though the manners of Mr.  Falkland were condescending and attentive, his hours of retirement were  principally occupied in contemplations too dignified for scandal, and  too large for the altercations of a vestry, or the politics of an  election-borough.    A short time before the dances began, Mr. Tyrrel went up to his fair  inamorata, and entered into some trifling conversation with her to fill  up the time, as intending in a few minutes to lead her forward to the  field. He had accustomed himself to neglect the ceremony of soliciting  beforehand a promise in his favour, as not supposing it possible that  any one would dare dispute his behests; and, had it been otherwise, he  would have thought the formality unnecessary in this case, his general  preference to Miss Hardingham being notorious.    While he was thus engaged, Mr. Falkland came up. Mr. Tyrrel always  regarded him with aversion and loathing. Mr. Falkland, however, slided  in a graceful and unaffected manner into the conversation already begun;  and the animated ingenuousness of his manner was such, as might for the  time have disarmed the devil of his malice. Mr. Tyrrel probably  conceived that his accosting Miss Hardingham was an accidental piece of  general ceremony, and expected every moment when he would withdraw to  another part of the room.    The company now began to be in motion for the dance, and Mr. Falkland  signified as much to Miss Hardingham. \"Sir,\" interrupted Mr. Tyrrel  abruptly, \"that lady is my partner.\"--\"I believe not, sir: that lady has  been so obliging as to accept my invitation.\"--\"I tell you, sir, no.  Sir, I have an interest in that lady's affections; and I will suffer no  man to intrude upon my claims.\"--\"The lady's affections are not the  subject of the present question.\"--\"Sir, it is to no purpose to parley.  Make room, sir!\"--Mr. Falkland gently repelled his antagonist. \"Mr.  Tyrrel!\" returned he, with some firmness, \"let us have no altercation in  this business: the master of the ceremonies is the proper person to  decide in a difference of this sort, if we cannot adjust it: we can  neither of us intend to exhibit our valour before the ladies, and shall  therefore cheerfully submit to his verdict.\"--\"Damn me, sir, if I  understand--\" \"Softly, Mr. Tyrrel; I intended you no offence. But, sir,  no man shall prevent my asserting that to which I have once acquired a  claim!\"    Mr. Falkland uttered these words with the most unruffled temper in the  world. The tone in which he spoke had acquired elevation, but neither  roughness nor impatience. There was a fascination in his manner that  made the ferociousness of his antagonist subside into impotence. Miss  Hardingham had begun to repent of her experiment, but her alarm was  speedily quieted by the dignified composure of her new partner. Mr.  Tyrrel walked away without answering a word. He muttered curses as he  went, which the laws of honour did not oblige Mr. Falkland to overhear,  and which indeed it would have been no easy task to have overheard with  accuracy. Mr. Tyrrel would not, perhaps, have so easily given up his  point, had not his own good sense presently taught him, that, however  eager he might be for revenge, this was not the ground he should desire  to occupy. But, though he could not openly resent this rebellion against  his authority, he brooded over it in the recesses of a malignant mind;  and it was evident enough that he was accumulating materials for a  bitter account, to which he trusted his adversary should one day be  brought.          CHAPTER IV.      This was only one out of innumerable instances, that every day seemed to  multiply, of petty mortifications which Mr. Tyrrel was destined to  endure on the part of Mr. Falkland. In all of them Mr. Falkland  conducted himself with such unaffected propriety, as perpetually to add  to the stock of his reputation. The more Mr. Tyrrel struggled with his  misfortune, the more conspicuous and inveterate it became. A thousand  times he cursed his stars, which took, as he apprehended, a malicious  pleasure in making Mr. Falkland, at every turn, the instrument of his  humiliation. Smarting under a succession of untoward events, he  appeared to feel, in the most exquisite manner, the distinctions paid to  his adversary, even in those points in which he had not the slightest  pretensions. An instance of this now occurred.    Mr. Clare, a poet whose works have done immortal honour to the country  that produced him, had lately retired, after a life spent in the  sublimest efforts of genius, to enjoy the produce of his economy, and  the reputation he had acquired, in this very neighbourhood. Such an  inmate was looked up to by the country gentlemen with a degree of  adoration. They felt a conscious pride in recollecting that the boast of  England was a native of their vicinity; and they were by no means  deficient in gratitude when they saw him, who had left them an  adventurer, return into the midst of them, in the close of his days,  crowned with honours and opulence. The reader is acquainted with his  works: he has, probably, dwelt upon them with transport; and I need not  remind him of their excellence: but he is, perhaps, a stranger to his  personal qualifications; he does not know that his productions were  scarcely more admirable than his conversation. In company he seemed to  be the only person ignorant of the greatness of his fame. To the world  his writings will long remain a kind of specimen of what the human mind  is capable of performing; but no man perceived their defects so acutely  as he, or saw so distinctly how much yet remained to be effected: he  alone appeared to look upon his works with superiority and indifference.  One of the features that most eminently distinguished him was a  perpetual suavity of manners, a comprehensiveness of mind, that regarded  the errors of others without a particle of resentment, and made it  impossible for any one to be his enemy. He pointed out to men their  mistakes with frankness and unreserve, his remonstrances produced  astonishment and conviction, but without uneasiness, in the party to  whom they were addressed: they felt the instrument that was employed to  correct their irregularities, but it never mangled what it was intended  to heal. Such were the moral qualities that distinguished him among his  acquaintance. The intellectual accomplishments he exhibited were,  principally, a tranquil and mild enthusiasm, and a richness of  conception which dictated spontaneously to his tongue, and flowed with  so much ease, that it was only by retrospect you could be made aware of  the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented.    Mr. Clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were  capable of participating in his ideas and amusements. It has been among  the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude, and converse with woods  and groves, rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds  like their own. From the moment of Mr. Falkland's arrival in the  neighbourhood, Mr. Clare distinguished him in the most flattering  manner. To so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience  and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any  character that presented itself. The materials of his judgment had long  since been accumulated; and, at the close of so illustrious a life, he  might almost be said to see through nature at a glance. What wonder that  he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his  own? But to Mr. Tyrrel's diseased imagination, every distinction  bestowed on his neighbour "]]]
