The  historian of English poetry, admirably applying to him a passage out of  Milton, says that \"Hell grows darker at his frown.\" [26]    Walter Scott could not read him, at least not with pleasure. He tells  Miss Seward that the \"plan\" of the poem appeared to him \"unhappy;  the personal malignity and strange mode of revenge presumptuous and  uninteresting.\" [27] Uninteresting, I think, it is impossible to consider  it. The known world is there, and the unknown pretends to be there; and  both are surely interesting to most people.    Landor, in his delightful book the _Pentameron_--a book full of the  profoundest as well as sweetest humanity--makes Petrarch follow up  Boccaccio's eulogies of the episode of Paulo and Francesca with  ebullitions of surprise and horror:    \"_Petrarca_. Perfection of poetry! The greater is my wonder at  discovering nothing else of the same order or cast in this whole section  of the poem. He who fainted at the recital of Francesca,      'And he who fell as a dead body falls'    would exterminate all the inhabitants of every town in Italy! What  execrations against Florence, Pistoia, Pisa, Siena, Genoa! what hatred  against the whole human race! what exultation and merriment at eternal  and immitigable sufferings! Seeing this, I cannot but consider the  _Inferno_ as the most immoral and impious book that ever was written.  Yet, hopeless that our country shall ever see again such poetry, and  certain that without it our future poets would be more feebly urged  forward to excellence, I would have dissuaded Dante from cancelling it,  if this had been his intention.\" [28]    Most happily is the distinction here intimated between the  undesirableness of Dante's book in a moral and religious point of view,  and the greater desirableness of it, nevertheless, as a pattern of  poetry; for absurdity, however potent, wears itself out in the end, and  leaves what is good and beautiful to vindicate even so foul an origin.    Again, Petrarch says, \"What an object of sadness and of consternation,  he who rises up from hell like a giant refreshed!    \"_Boccaccio_. Strange perversion! A pillar of smoke by day and of fire  by night, to guide no one. Paradise had fewer wants for him to satisfy  than hell had, all which he fed to repletion; but let us rather look to  his poetry than his temper.\"    See also what is said in that admirable book further on (p. 50),  respecting the most impious and absurd passage in all Dante's poem, the  assumption about Divine Love in the inscription over hell-gate--one of  those monstrosities of conception which none ever had the effrontery to  pretend to vindicate, except theologians who profess to be superior to  the priests of Moloch, and who yet defy every feeling of decency and  humanity for the purpose of explaining their own worldly, frightened,  or hard-hearted submission to the mistakes of the most wretched  understandings. Ugo Foscolo, an excellent critic where his own temper  and violence did not interfere, sees nothing but jealousy in Petrarch's  dislike of Dante, and nothing but Jesuitism in similar feelings  entertained by such men as Tiraboschi. But all gentle and considerate  hearts must dislike the rage and bigotry in Dante, even were it true (as  the Dantesque Foscolo thinks) that Italy will never be regenerated till  one-half of it is baptised in the blood of the other![29] Such men, with  all their acuteness, are incapable of seeing what can be effected by  nobler and serener times, and the progress of civilisation. They fancy,  no doubt, that they are vindicating the energies of Nature herself, and  the inevitable necessity of \"doing evil that good may come.\" But Dante  in so doing violated the Scripture he professed to revere; and men must  not assume to themselves that final knowledge of results, which is the  only warrant of the privilege, and the possession of which is to be  arrogated by no earthly wisdom. One calm discovery of science may do  away with all the boasted eternal necessities of the angry and the  self-idolatrous. The passions that may be necessary to savages are not  bound to remain so to civilised men, any more than the eating of man's  flesh or the worship of Jugghernaut. When we think of the wonderful  things lately done by science for the intercourse of the world, and  the beautiful and tranquil books of philosophy written by men of equal  energy and benevolence, and opening the peacefulest hopes for mankind,  and views of creation to which Dante's universe was a nutshell,--such  a vision as that of his poem (in a theological point of view) seems no  better than the dream of an hypochondriacal savage, and his nutshell a  rottenness to be spit out of the mouth.    Heaven send that the great poet's want of charity has not made myself  presumptuous and uncharitable! But it is in the name of society I  speak; and words, at all events, now-a-days are not the terrible,  stake-preceding things they were in his. Readers in general,  however--even those of the literary world--have little conception of  the extent to which Dante carries either his cruelty or his abuse. The  former (of which I shall give some examples presently) shews appalling  habits of personal resentment; the latter is outrageous to a pitch of  the ludicrous--positively screaming. I will give some specimens of it  out of Foscolo himself, who collects them for a different purpose;  though, with all his idolatry of Dante, he was far from being insensible  to his mistakes.    \"The people of Sienna,\" according to this national and Christian poet,  were \"a parcel of cox-combs; those of Arezzo, dogs; and of Casentino,  hogs. Lucca made a trade of perjury. Pistoia was a den of beasts, and  ought to be reduced to ashes; and the river Arno should overflow and  drown every soul in Pisa. Almost all the women in Florence walked  half-naked in public, and were abandoned in private. Every brother,  husband, son, and father, in Bologna, set their women to sale. In all  Lombardy were not to be found three men who were not rascals; and in  Genoa and Romagna people went about pretending to be men, but in reality  were bodies inhabited by devils, their souls having gone to the 'lowest  pit of hell' to join the betrayers of their friends and kinsmen.\" [30]    So much for his beloved countrymen. As for foreigners, particularly  kings, \"Edward the First of England, and Robert of Scotland, were a  couple of grasping fools; the Emperor Albert was an usurper; Alphonso  the Second, of Spain, a debauchee; the King of Bohemia a coward;  Frederick of Arragon a coward and miser; the Kings of Portugal and  Norway forgers; the King of Naples a man whose virtues were expressed  by a unit, and his vices by a million; and the King of France, the  descendant of a Paris butcher, and of progenitors who poisoned St.  Thomas Aquinas, their descendants conquering with the arms of Judas  rather than of soldiers, and selling the flesh of their daughters to old  men, in order to extricate themselves from a danger.\" [31]    When we add to these invectives, damnations of friends as well as foes,  of companions, lawyers, men of letters, princes, philosophers, popes,  pagans, innocent people as well as guilty, fools and wise, capable and  incapable, men, women, and children,--it is really no better than a kind  of diabolical sublimation of Lord Thurlow's anathemas in the _Rolliad_,  which begins with      \"Damnation seize ye all;\"    and ends with      \"Damn them beyond what mortal tongue can tell,    Confound, sink, plunge them all to deepest blackest hell.\" [32]    In the gross, indeed, this is ridiculous enough.    No burlesque can beat it. But in the particular, one is astonished and  saddened at the cruelties in which the poet allows his imagination to  riot horrors generally described with too intense a verisimilitude not  to excite our admiration, with too astounding a perseverance not to  amaze our humanity, and sometimes with an amount of positive joy  and delight that makes us ready to shut the book with disgust and  indignation. Thus, in a circle in hell, where traitors are stuck up  to their chins in ice (canto xxxii.), the visitor, in walking about,  happens to give one of their faces a kick; the sufferer weeps, and  then curses him--with such infernal truth does the writer combine the  malignant with the pathetic! Dante replies to the curse by asking the  man his name. He is refused it. He then seizes the miserable wretch  by the hair, in order to force him to the disclosure; and Virgil is  represented as commending the barbarity![33] But he does worse. To  barbarity he adds treachery of his own. He tells another poor wretch,  whose face is iced up with his tears, as if he had worn a crystal vizor,  that if he will disclose his name and offence, he will relieve his eyes  awhile, _that he may weep_. The man does so; and the ferocious poet  then refuses to perform his promise, adding mockery to falsehood, and  observing that ill manners are the only courtesy proper to wards such  a fellow![34] It has been conjectured, that Macchiavelli apparently  encouraged the enormities of the princes of his time, with a design to  expose them to indignation. It might have been thought of Dante, if he  had not taken a part in the cruelty, that he detailed the horrors of his  hell out of a wish to disgust the world with its frightful notions of  God. This is certainly the effect of the worst part of his descriptions  in an age like the present. Black burning gulfs, full of outcries  and blasphemy, feet red-hot with fire, men eternally eating their  fellow-creatures, frozen wretches malignantly dashing their iced heads  against one another, other adversaries mutually exchanging shapes by  force of an attraction at once irresistible and loathing, and spitting  with hate "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10886"],[0,"The Untamed (#9)"],[1," from which the last  glass had been filled. Not another man in the room stirred from his  place. Some sat with their cards raised in the very act of playing.  Some had stopped midway a laugh. One man had been tying a bootlace.  His body did not rise. Only his eyes rolled up to watch.    Dan darted under the outstretched arms of Silent, fairly heaved him up  from the floor and drove him backwards. The big man half stumbled and  half fell, knocking aside two chairs. He rushed back with a shout, but  at sight of the white face with the thin trickle of blood falling from  the lips, and at the sound of that inhuman laughter, he paused again.    Once more Dan was upon him, his hands darting out with motions too  fast for the eye to follow. Jim Silent stepped back a half pace,  shifted his weight, and drove his fist straight at that white face.  How it happened not a man in the room could tell, but the hand did not  strike home. Dan had swerved aside as lightly as a wind-blown feather  and his fist rapped against Silent's ribs with a force that made the  giant grunt.    Some of the horror was gone from his face and in its stead was baffled  rage. He knew the scientific points of boxing, and he applied them.  His eye was quick and sure. His reach was whole inches longer than his  opponent's. His strength was that of two ordinary men. What did it  avail him? He was like an agile athlete in the circus playing tag with  a black panther. He was like a child striking futilely at a wavering  butterfly. Sometimes this white-faced, laughing devil ducked under  his arms. Sometimes a sidestep made his blows miss by the slightest  fraction of an inch.    And for every blow he struck four rained home against him. It was  impossible! It could not be! Silent telling himself that he dreamed,  and those dancing fists crashed into his face and body like  sledgehammers. There was no science in the thing which faced him. Had  there been trained skill the second blow would have knocked Silent  unconscious, and he knew it, but Dan made no effort to strike a  vulnerable spot. He hit at anything which offered.    Still he laughed as he leaped back and forth. Perhaps mere weight of  rushing would beat the dancing will-o'-the-wisp to the floor. Silent  bored in with lowered head and clutched at his enemy. Then he roared  with triumph. His outstretched hand caught Dan's shirt as the latter  flicked to one side. Instantly they were locked in each other's arms!  The most meaning part of the fight followed.    The moment after they grappled, Silent shifted his right arm from its  crushing grip on Dan's body and clutched at the throat. The move was  as swift as lightning, but the parry of the smaller man was still  quicker. His left hand clutched Silent by the wrist, and that mighty  sweep of arm was stopped in mid-air! They were in the middle of the  room. They stood perfectly erect and close together, embraced. Their  position had a ludicrous resemblance to the posture of dancers, but  their bodies were trembling with effort. With every ounce of power in  his huge frame Silent strove to complete his grip at the throat.  He felt the right arm of Dan tightening around him closer, closer,  closer! It was not a bulky arm, but it seemed to be made of linked  steel which was shrinking into him, and promised to crush his very  bones. The strength of this man seemed to increase. It was limitless.  His breath came struggling under that pressure and the blood thundered  and raged in his temples. If he could only get at that soft throat!    But his struggling right hand was held in a vice of iron. Now his numb  arm gave way, slowly, inevitably. He ground his teeth and cursed. His  curse was half a prayer. For answer there was the unearthly chuckle  just below his ear. His hand was moved back, down, around! He was  helpless as a child in the arms of its father--no, helpless as a sheep  in the constricting coils of a python.    An impulse of frantic horror and shame and fear gave him redoubled  strength for an instant. He tore himself clear and reeled back. Dan  planted two smashes on Silent's snarling mouth. A glance showed the  large man the mute, strained faces around the room. The laughing devil  leaped again. Then all pride slipped like water from the heart of Jim  Silent, and in its place there was only icy fear, fear not of a man,  but of animal power. He caught up a heavy chair and drove it with all  his desperate strength at Dan.    It cracked distinctly against his head and the weight of it fairly  drove him into the floor. He fell with a limp thud on the boards.  Silent, reeling and blind, staggered to and fro in the centre of the  room. Morgan and Lee Haines reached Dan at the same moment and kneeled  beside him.          CHAPTER VII      THE MUTE MESSENGER    Almost at once Haines raised a hand and spoke to the crowd: \"He's all  right, boys. Badly cut across the head and stunned, but he'll live.\"    There was a deep gash on the upper part of the forehead. If the  cross-bar of the chair had not broken, the skull might have been  injured. The impact of the blow had stunned him, and it might be many  minutes before his senses returned.    As the crowd closed around Dan, a black body leaped among them,  snarling hideously. They sprang back with a yell from the rush of this  green-eyed fury; but Black Bart made no effort to attack them. He sat  crouching before the prostrate body, licking the deathly white face,  and growling horribly, and then stood over his fallen master and  stared about the circle. Those who had seen a lone wolf make its stand  against a pack of dogs recognized the attitude. Then without a sound,  as swiftly as he had entered the room, he leaped through the door and  darted off up the road. Satan, for the first time deserted by this  wolfish companion, turned a high head and neighed after him, but he  raced on.    The men returned to their work over Dan's body, cursing softly. There  was a hair-raising unearthliness about the sudden coming and departure  of Black Bart. Jim Silent and his comrades waited no longer, but took  to their saddles and galloped down the road.    Within a few moments the crowd at Morgan's place began to thin out.  Evening was coming on, and most of them had far to ride. They might  have lingered until midnight, but this peculiar accident damped their  spirits. Probably not a hundred words were spoken from the moment  Silent struck Dan to the time when the last of the cattlemen took to  the saddle. They avoided each other's eyes as if in shame. In a short  time only Morgan remained working over Dan.    In the house of old Joe Cumberland his daughter sat fingering the keys  of the only piano within many miles. The evening gloom deepened as she  played with upward face and reminiscent eyes. The tune was uncertain,  weird--for she was trying to recall one of those nameless airs which  Dan whistled as he rode through the hills. There came a patter of  swift, light footfalls in the hall, and then a heavy scratching at the  door.    \"Down, Bart!\" she called, and went to admit him to the room.    The moment she turned the handle the door burst open and Bart fell in  against her. She cried out at sight of the gleaming teeth and eyes,  but he fawned about her feet, alternately whining and snarling.    \"What is it, boy?\" she asked, gathering her skirts close about her  ankles and stepping back, for she never was without some fear of this  black monster. \"What do you want, Bart?\"    For reply he stood stock still, raised his nose, and emitted a long  wail, a mournful, a ghastly sound, with a broken-hearted quaver at the  end. Kate Cumberland shrank back still farther until the wall blocked  her retreat. Black Bart had never acted like this before. He followed  her with a green light in his eyes, which shone phosphorescent and  distinct through the growing shadows. And most terrible of all was  the sound which came deep in his throat as if his brute nature was  struggling to speak human words. She felt a great impulse to cry out  for help, but checked herself. He was still crouching about her feet.  Obviously he meant no harm to her.    He turned and ran towards the door, stopped, looked back to her, and  made a sound which was nearer to the bark of a dog than anything he  had ever uttered. She made a step after him. He whined with delight  and moved closer to the door. Now she stopped again. He whirled and  ran back, caught her dress in his teeth, and again made for the door,  tugging her after him.    At last she understood and followed him. When she went towards the  corral to get her horse, he planted himself in front of her and  snarled so furiously that she gave up her purpose. She was beginning  to be more and more afraid. A childish thought came to her that  perhaps this brute was attempting to lure her away from the house, as  she had seen coyotes lure dogs, and then turn his teeth against her.  Nevertheless she followed. Something in the animal's eagerness moved  her deeply. When he led her out to the road he released her dress and  trotted ahead a short distance, looking back and whining, as if to beg  her to go faster. For the first time the thought of Dan came into her  mind. Black Bart was leading her down the road towards Morgan's place.  What if something had happened to Dan?    She caught a breath of sharp terror and broke into a run. Bart yelped  his pleasure. Yet a cold horror rose in her heart as she hurried. Had  her father after all been right? What power had Dan, if he needed her,  to communicate with this mute beast and send him to her? As she ran  she wished for the day, the warm, clear sun--for these growing shadows  of evening bred a thousand ghostly thoughts. Black Bart was running  backwards and forwards before her as if he half entreated and half  threatened her.    Her heart died within her as she came in sight of Morgan's place.  There was only one horse before it, and that was the"]]]
