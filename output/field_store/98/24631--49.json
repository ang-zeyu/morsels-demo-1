Without staying any longer in the market, the peasant went directly  to the palace, and placed himself exactly before the king's  apartment. His majesty, being at a window where he could see all  that passed in the court, no sooner cast his eyes on this beautiful  bird, than he sent an officer to buy it for him. The officer, going  to the peasant, asked him how much he wanted for that bird. 'If it  be for his majesty,' answered the peasant, 'I humbly beg of him to  accept it of me as a present, and I desire you to carry it to him.'  The officer took the bird to the king, who found it so great a  rarity that he ordered the same officer to take ten pieces of gold,  and carry them to the peasant, who departed very well satisfied.  The king ordered the bird to be put into a magnificent cage, and  gave it seed and water in rich vessels.    His majesty being then ready to go hunting, had not time to  consider the bird, therefore had it brought to him as soon as he  came back. The officer brought the cage, and the king, that he  might better see the bird, took it out himself, and perched it upon  his hand. Looking earnestly at it, he asked the officer if he had  seen it eat. 'Sir,' replied the officer, 'your majesty may observe  the vessel with his food is still full, and he has not touched any  of it.' Then the king ordered him meat of various sorts, that he  might take what he liked best.    The table being spread, and dinner served up just as the king had  given these orders, the bird, flapping his wings, hopped off the  king's hand, and flew on to the table, where he began to peck the  bread and victuals, sometimes on one plate, and sometimes on  another. The king was so surprised, that he immediately sent the  officer to desire the queen to come and see this wonder. The  officer related it to her majesty, and she came forthwith: but she  no sooner saw the bird, than she covered her face with her veil,  and would have retired. The king, surprised at her proceeding,  asked the reason of it.    'Sir,' answered the queen, 'your majesty will no longer be  surprised when you understand that this bird is not, as you take  it, a bird, but a man.'    'Madam,' said the king, more astonished than before, 'you are  making fun of me; you shall never persuade me that a bird can be a  man.'    'Sir,' replied the queen, 'far be it from me to make fun of your  majesty; nothing is more certain than what I have had the honour to  tell you. I can assure your majesty it is the King of Persia, named  Beder, son of the celebrated Gulnare, princess of one of the  largest kingdoms of the sea, nephew of Saleh, king of that kingdom,  and grandson of Queen Farasche, mother of Gulnare and Saleh; and it  was the Princess Giauhara, daughter of the King of Samandal, who  thus metamorphosed him into a bird.' That the king might no longer  doubt of what she affirmed, she told him the whole story, how and  for what reason the Princess Giauhara, had thus revenged herself  for the ill-treatment of King Saleh towards the king of Samandal,  her father.    The king had less difficulty in believing this assertion of the  queen in that he knew her to be a skilful magician, one of the  greatest in the world. And as she knew everything which took place,  he was always by her means timely informed of the designs of the  kings his neighbours against him, and prevented them. His majesty  had compassion on the King of Persia, and earnestly besought his  queen to break the enchantment, that he might return to his own  form.    The queen consented to it with great willingness. 'Sir,' said she  to the king, 'be pleased to take the bird into your room, and I  will show you a king worthy of the consideration you have for him.'  The bird, which had ceased eating, and attended to what the king  and queen said, would not give his majesty the trouble to take him,  but hopped into the room before him; and the queen came in soon  after, with a vessel full of water in her hand. She pronounced over  the vessel some words unknown to the king, till the water began to  boil, when she took some of it in her hand, and, sprinkling a  little upon the bird, said, 'By virtue of these holy and mysterious  words I have just pronounced, quit that form of a bird, and  reassume that which thou hast received from thy Creator.'    The words were scarcely out of the queen's mouth, when, instead of  a bird, the king saw a young prince. King Beder immediately fell on  his knees, and thanked God for the favour that had been bestowed  upon him. Then he took the king's hand, who helped him up, and  kissed it in token of gratitude; but the king embraced him with  great joy. He would then have made his acknowledgments to the  queen, but she had already retired to her apartment. The king made  him sit at the table with him, and, after dinner was over, prayed  him to relate how the Princess Giauhara could have had the  inhumanity to transform into a bird so amiable a prince as he was;  and the King of Persia immediately told him. When he had done, the  king, provoked at the proceeding of the princess, could not help  blaming her. 'It was commendable,' said he, 'in the Princess of  Samandal to feel hurt at the king her father's ill-treatment; but  to carry her vengeance so far, and especially against a prince who  was not guilty, was what she will never be able to justify herself  for. But let us have done with this discourse, and tell me, I  beseech you, in what I can further serve you.'    'Sir,' answered King Beder, 'my obligation to your majesty is so  great, that I ought to remain with you all my life to testify my  gratitude; but since your majesty sets no limits to your  generosity, I entreat you to grant me one of your ships to  transport me to Persia, where I fear my absence, which has been but  too long, may have occasioned some disorder, and that the queen my  mother, from whom I concealed my departure, may be dead of grief,  under the uncertainty whether I am alive or dead.'    The king granted what he desired with the best grace imaginable,  and immediately gave orders for equipping one of his largest ships,  and the best sailor in his numerous fleet. The ship was soon  furnished with all its crew, provisions, and ammunition; and as  soon as the wind became fair, King Beder embarked, after having  taken leave of the king, and thanked him for all his favours.    The ship sailed before the wind for ten days; on the eleventh day  the wind changed, and becoming very violent, there followed a  furious tempest. The ship was not only driven out of its course,  but so violently tossed, that all its masts went by the board; and  driving along at the pleasure of the wind, it at length struck  against a rock and split open.    The greater part of the people were instantly drowned. Some few  were saved by swimming, and others by getting on pieces of the  wreck. King Beder was among the latter, and, after having been  tossed about for some time by the waves and currents, he at length  perceived himself near the shore, and not far from a city that  seemed large. He exerted his remaining strength to reach the land,  and was at length fortunate to come so near as to be able to touch  the ground with his feet. He immediately abandoned his piece of  wood, which had been of so great service to him; but when he came  near the shore he was greatly surprised to see horses, camels,  mules, asses, oxen, cows, bulls, and other animals crowding to the  shore to oppose his landing. He had the utmost difficulty to  conquer their obstinacy and force his way; but at length he  succeeded, and sheltered himself among the rocks till he had  recovered his breath, and dried his clothes in the sun.    When the prince advanced to enter the city, he met with the same  opposition from these animals, who seemed to want to make him  understand that it was dangerous to proceed.    King Beder, however, got into the city soon after, and saw many  fair and spacious streets, but was surprised to find no man there.  This made him think it was not without cause that so many animals  had opposed his passage. Going forward, nevertheless, he observed  several shops open, which gave him reason to believe the place was  not so destitute of inhabitants as he imagined. He approached one  of these shops, where several sorts of fruits were exposed to sale,  and saluted very courteously an old man that was sitting there.    The old man, who was busy about something, lifted up his head, and  seeing a youth who had an appearance of grandeur, started, and  asked him whence he came, and what business had brought him there.  King Beder satisfied him in a few words; and the old man further  asked him if he had met anybody on the road. 'You are the first  person I have seen,' answered the king; 'and I cannot comprehend  how so fine and large a city comes to be without inhabitants.'    'Come in, sir; stay no longer upon the threshold,' replied the old  man, 'or peradventure some misfortune may happen to you. I will  satisfy your curiosity at leisure, and give you the reason why it  is necessary you should take this precaution.'    King Beder would not be bidden twice: he entered the shop, and sat  down by the old man. The latter knew he must want food, therefore  immediately presented him with what was necessary to recover his  strength; and although King Beder was very anxious to know why he  had taken the precaution to make him enter the shop, the old man  nevertheless would not tell him anything till he had done eating,  for fear the sad things he had to relate might take away his  appetite. At last he said to him, 'You have great reason to thank  God you got hither without any misfortune.'    'Alas! why?' replied king Beder, very much surprised and alarmed.    'Because,' answered he, 'this city is called the City of  Enchantments, and is governed not by a king, but by a queen, who is  a notorious and dangerous sorceress.

How has a little wit, a little genius, been celebrated in a  Woman! What an intellectual triumph was that of the lonely Aspasia,  and how heartily acknowledged! She, indeed, met a Pericles. But what  annalist, the rudest of men, the most plebeian of husbands, will spare  from his page one of the few anecdotes of Roman women--Sappho!  Eloisa! The names are of threadbare celebrity. Indeed, they were not  more suitably met in their own time than the Countess Colonel Plater  on her first joining the army. They had much to mourn, and their great  impulses did not find due scope. But with time enough, space enough,  their kindred appear on the scene. Across the ages, forms lean, trying  to touch the hem of their retreating robes. The youth here by my side  cannot be weary of the fragments from the life of Sappho. He will not  believe they are not addressed to himself, or that he to whom they  were addressed could be ungrateful. A recluse of high powers devotes  himself to understand and explain the thought of Eloisa; he asserts  her vast superiority in soul and genius to her master; he curses the  fate that casts his lot in another age than hers. He could have  understood her; he would have been to her a friend, such as Abelard  never could. And this one Woman he could have loved and reverenced,  and she, alas! lay cold in her grave hundreds of years ago. His sorrow  is truly pathetic. These responses, that come too late to give joy,  are as tragic as anything we know, and yet the tears of later ages  glitter as they fall on Tasso's prison bars. And we know how  elevating to the captive is the security that somewhere an  intelligence must answer to his.    The Man habitually most narrow towards Woman will be flushed, as by  the worst assault on Christianity, if you say it has made no  improvement in her condition. Indeed, those most opposed to new acts  in her favor, are jealous of the reputation of those which have been  done.    We will not speak of the enthusiasm excited by actresses,  improvisatrici, female singers,--for here mingles the charm of beauty  and grace,--but female authors, even learned women, if not  insufferably ugly and slovenly, from the Italian professor's daughter  who taught behind the curtain, down to Mrs. Carter and Madame Dacier,  are sure of an admiring audience, and, what is far better, chance to  use what they have learned, and to learn more, if they can once get a  platform on which to stand.    But how to get this platform, or how to make it of reasonably easy  access, is the difficulty. Plants of great vigor will almost always  struggle into blossom, despite impediments. But there should be  encouragement, and a free genial atmosphere for those of move timid  sort, fair play for each in its own kind. Some are like the little,  delicate flowers which love to hide in the dripping mosses, by the  sides of mountain torrents, or in the shade of tall trees. But others  require an open field, a rich and loosened soil, or they never show  their proper hues.    It may be said that Man does not have his fair play either; his  energies are repressed and distorted by the interposition of  artificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself has put them there; they have  grown out of his own imperfections. If there _is_ a misfortune in  Woman's lot, it is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do  _not_ mark her state; and, if they express her past ignorance, do  not her present needs. As every Man is of Woman born, she has slow but  sure means of redress; yet the sooner a general justness of thought  makes smooth the path, the better.    Man is of Woman born, and her face bends over him in infancy with an  expression he can never quite forget. Eminent men have delighted to  pay tribute to this image, and it is an hackneyed observation, that  most men of genius boast some remarkable development in the mother.  The rudest tar brushes off a tear with his coat-sleeve at the hallowed  name. The other day, I met a decrepit old man of seventy, on a  journey, who challenged the stage company to guess where he was going.  They guessed aright, \"To see your mother.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"she is  ninety-two, but has good eyesight still, they say. I have not seen her  these forty years, and I thought I could not die in peace without.\" I  should have liked his picture painted as a companion-piece to that of  a boisterous little boy, whom I saw attempt to declaim at a school  exhibition--      \"O that those lips had language! Life has passed    With me but roughly since I heard thee last.\"      He got but very little way before sudden tears shamed him from the  stage.    Some gleams of the same expression which shone down upon his infancy,  angelically pure and benign, visit Man again with hopes of pure love,  of a holy marriage. Or, if not before, in the eyes of the mother of  his child they again are seen, and dim fancies pass before his mind,  that Woman may not have been born for him alone, but have come from  heaven, a commissioned soul, a messenger of truth and love; that she  can only make for him a home in which he may lawfully repose, in so  far as she is      \"True to the kindred points of Heaven and home.\"      In gleams, in dim fancies, this thought visits the mind of common men.  It is soon obscured by the mists of sensuality, the dust of routine,  and he thinks it was only some meteor or ignis fatuus that shone. But,  as a Rosicrucian lamp, it burns unwearied, though condemned to the  solitude of tombs; and to its permanent life, as to every truth, each  age has in some form borne witness. For the truths, which visit the  minds of careless men only in fitful gleams, shine with radiant  clearness into those of the poet, the priest, and the artist.    Whatever may have been the domestic manners of the ancients, the idea  of Woman was nobly manifested in their mythologies and poems, whore  she appears as Site in the Ramayana, a form of tender purity; as the  Egyptian Isis, [Footnote: For an adequate description of the Isis, see  Appendix A.] of divine wisdom never yet surpassed. In Egypt, too, the  Sphynx, walking the earth with lion tread, looked out upon its marvels  in the calm, inscrutable beauty of a virgin's face, and the Greek  could only add wings to the great emblem. In Greece, Ceres and  Proserpine, significantly termed \"the great goddesses,\" were seen  seated side by side. They needed not to rise for any worshipper or any  change; they were prepared for all things, as those initiated to their  mysteries knew. More obvious is the meaning of these three forms, the  Diana, Minerva, and Vesta. Unlike in the expression of their beauty,  but alike in this,--that each was self-sufficing. Other forms were  only accessories and illustrations, none the complement to one like  these. Another might, indeed, be the companion, and the Apollo and  Diana set off one another's beauty. Of the Vesta, it is to be  observed, that not only deep-eyed, deep-discerning Greece, but ruder  Rome, who represents the only form of good man (the always busy  warrior) that could be indifferent to Woman, confided the permanence  of its glory to a tutelary goddess, and her wisest legislator spoke of  meditation as a nymph.    Perhaps in Rome the neglect of Woman was a reaction on the manners of  Etruria, where the priestess Queen, warrior Queen, would seem to have  been so usual a character.    An instance of the noble Roman marriage, where the stern and calm  nobleness of the nation was common to both, we see in the historic  page through the little that is told us of Brutus and Portia.  Shakspeare has seized on the relation in its native lineaments,  harmonizing the particular with the universal; and, while it is  conjugal love, and no other, making it unlike the same relation as  seen in Cymbeline, or Othello, even as one star differeth from another  in glory.          \"By that great vow    Which did incorporate and make us one,    Unfold to me, yourself, your other half,    Why you are heavy. ...        Dwell I but in the suburbs    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,    Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.\"      Mark the sad majesty of his tone in answer. Who would not have lent a  life-long credence to that voice of honor?      \"You are my true and honorable wife;     As dear to me as are the ruddy drops     That visit this sad heart.\"      It is the same voice that tells the moral of his life in the last  words--            \"Countrymen,    My heart doth joy, that, yet in all my life,    I found no man but he was true to me.\"      It was not wonderful that it should be so.    Shakspeare, however, was not content to let Portia rest her plea for  confidence on the essential nature of the marriage bond:      \"I grant I am a woman; but withal,    A woman that lord Brutus took to wife.    I grant I am a woman; but withal,    A woman well reputed--Cato's daughter.    Think you I am _no stronger than my sex_,    Being so fathered and so husbanded?\"      And afterward in the very scene where Brutus is suffering under that  \"insupportable and touching loss,\" the death of his wife, Cassius  pleads--        \"Have you not love enough to bear with me,      When that rash humor which my mother gave me      Makes me forgetful?      _Brutus_.--Yes, Cassius, and henceforth,      When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,      He'll think your mother chides, and leaves you so.\"      As indeed it was a frequent belief among the ancients, as with our  Indians, that the _body_ was inherited from the mother, the  _soul_ from the father. As in that noble passage of Ovid, already  quoted, where Jupiter, as his divine synod are looking down on the  funeral pyre of Hercules, thus triumphs--      \"Neo nisi _materna_ Vulcanum parte potentem,    Sentiet. Aeternum est, a me quod traxit, et expers    Atque immune neois, nullaque domabile flamma    Idque ego"]]]
