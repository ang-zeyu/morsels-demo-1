I thought the beer might loosen his mind a bit.    \"Better take a couple of quid,\" said Jack. \"You look as if you want some  new shirts and things.\" But a pound was enough for me, and I think he  had reason to be glad of that later on, as it turned out.    \"Anything new in Bourke?\" asked Jack as we drank the beer.    \"No,\" I said, \"not a thing--except there's a pretty girl in the  Salvation Army.\"    \"And it's about time,\" growled Jack.    \"Now, look here, Jack,\" I said presently, \"what's come over you lately  at all? I might be able to help you. It's not a bit of use telling  me that there's nothing the matter. When a man takes to brooding and  travelling alone it's a bad sign, and it will end in a leaning tree and  a bit of clothes-line as likely as not. Tell me what the trouble is.  Tell us all about it. There's a ghost, isn't there?\"    \"Well, I suppose so,\" said Jack. \"We've all got our ghosts for that  matter. But never you mind, Harry; I'm all right. I don't go interfering  with your ghosts, and I don't see what call you've got to come haunting  mine. Why, it's as bad as kicking a man's dog.\" And he gave the ghost of  a grin.    \"Tell me, Jack,\" I said, \"is it a woman?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"it's a woman. Now, are you satisfied?\"    \"Is it a girl?\" I asked.    \"Yes,\" he said.    So there was no more to be said. I'd thought it might have been a lot  worse than a girl. I'd thought he might have got married somewhere,  sometime, and made a mess of it.    We had dinner at Billy Woods's place, and a sensible Christmas dinner it  was--everything cold, except the vegetables, with the hose going on the  veranda in spite of the by-laws, and Billy's wife and her sister, fresh  and cool-looking and jolly, instead of being hot and brown and cross  like most Australian women who roast themselves over a blazing fire in  a hot kitchen on a broiling day, all the morning, to cook scalding  plum pudding and redhot roasts, for no other reason than that their  grandmothers used to cook hot Christmas dinners in England.    And in the afternoon we went for a row on the river, pulling easily up  the anabranch and floating down with the stream under the shade of  the river timber--instead of going to sleep and waking up helpless and  soaked in perspiration, to find the women with headaches, as many do on  Christmas Day in Australia.    Mrs Woods tried to draw Jack out, but it was no use, and in the evening  he commenced drinking, and that made Billy uneasy. \"I'm afraid Jack's on  the wrong track,\" he said.    After tea most of us collected about Watty's veranda. Most things that  happened in Bourke happened at Watty's pub, or near it.    If a horse bolted with a buggy or cart, he was generally stopped outside  Watty's, which seemed to suggest, as Mitchell said, that most of the  heroes drank at Watty's--also that the pluckiest men were found amongst  the hardest drinkers. (But sometimes the horse fetched up against  Watty's sign and lamppost--which was a stout one of \"iron-bark\"--and  smashed the trap.) Then Watty's was the Carriers' Arms, a union pub; and  Australian teamsters are mostly hard cases: while there was something in  Watty's beer which made men argue fluently, and the best fights came  off in his backyard. Watty's dogs were the most quarrelsome in town, and  there was a dog-fight there every other evening, followed as often as  not by a man-fight. If a bushman's horse ran away with him the chances  were that he'd be thrown on to Watty's veranda, if he wasn't pitched  into the bar; and victims of accidents, and sick, hard-up shearers,  were generally carried to Watty's pub, as being the most convenient and  comfortable for them. Mitchell denied that it was generosity or good  nature on Watty's part, he said it was all business--advertisement.  Watty knew what he was doing. He was very deep, was Watty. Mitchell  further hinted that if he was sick _he_ wouldn't be carried to Watty's,  for Watty knew what a thirsty business a funeral was. Tom Hall reckoned  that Watty bribed the Army on the quiet.    I was sitting on a stool along the veranda wall with Donald Macdonald,  Bob Brothers (the Giraffe) and Mitchell, and one or two others, and Jack  Moonlight sat on the floor with his back to the wall and his hat well  down over his eyes. The Army came along at the usual time, but we didn't  see the Pretty Girl at first--she was a bit late. Mitchell said he liked  to be at Watty's when the Army prayed and the Pretty Girl was there;  he had no objection to being prayed for by a girl like that, though he  reckoned that nothing short of a real angel could save him now. He said  his old grandmother used to pray for him every night of her life and  three times on Sunday, with Christmas Day extra when Christmas Day  didn't fall on a Sunday; but Mitchell reckoned that the old lady  couldn't have had much influence because he became more sinful every  year, and went deeper in ways of darkness, until finally he embarked on  a career of crime.    The Army prayed, and then a thin \"ratty\" little woman bobbed up in  the ring; she'd gone mad on religion as women do on woman's rights and  hundreds of other things. She was so skinny in the face, her jaws so  prominent, and her mouth so wide, that when she opened it to speak it  was like a ventriloquist's dummy and you could almost see the cracks  open down under her ears.    \"They say I'm cracked!\" she screamed in a shrill, cracked voice. \"But  I'm not cracked--I'm only cracked on the Lord Jesus Christ! That's all  I'm cracked on----.\" And just then the Amen man of the Army--the Army  groaner we called him, who was always putting both feet in it--just then  he blundered forward, rolled up his eyes, threw his hands up and down as  if he were bouncing two balls, and said, with deep feeling:    \"Thank the Lord she's got a crack in the right place!\"    Tom Hall doubled up, and most of the other sinners seemed to think there  was something very funny about it. And the Army, too, seemed struck with  an idea that there was something wrong somewhere, for they started a  hymn.    A big American negro, who'd been a night watchman in Sydney, stepped  into the ring and waved his arms and kept time, and as he got excited he  moved his hands up and down rapidly, as if he was hauling down a rope  in a great hurry through a pulley block above, and he kept saying, \"Come  down, Lord!\" all through the hymn, like a bass accompaniment, \"Come  down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord!\" and the  quicker be said it the faster he hauled. He was as good as a drum. And,  when the hymn was over, he started to testify.    \"My frens!\" he said, \"I was once black as der coals in der mined! I was  once black as der ink in der ocean of sin! But now--thank an' bless the  Lord!--I am whiter dan der dribben snow!\"    Tom Hall sat down on the edge of the veranda and leaned his head against  a post and cried. He had contributed a bob this evening, and he was  getting his money's worth.    Then the Pretty Girl arrived and was pushed forward into the ring.  She looked thinner and whiter than I'd ever seen her, and there was a  feverish brightness in her eyes that I didn't like.    \"Men!\" she said, \"this is Christmas Day-.\" I didn't hear any more for,  at the sound of her voice, Jack Moonlight jumped up as if he'd sat on a  baby. He started forward, stared at her for a moment as if he couldn't  believe his eyes, and then said, \"Hannah!\" short and sharp. She started  as if she was shot, gave him a wild look, and stumbled forward; the next  moment he had her in his arms and was steering for the private parlour.    I heard Mrs Bothways calling for water and smelling-salts; she was as  fat as Watty, and very much like him in the face, but she was emotional  and sympathetic. Then presently I heard, through the open window, the  Pretty Girl say to Jack, \"Oh, Jack, Jack! Why did you go away and leave  me like that? It was cruel!\"    \"But you told me to go, Hannah,\" said Jack.    \"That-that didn't make any difference. Why didn't you write?\" she  sobbed.    \"Because you never wrote to me, Hannah,\" he said.    \"That--that was no excuse!\" she said. \"It was so k-k-k-cruel of you,  Jack.\"    Mrs Bothways pulled down the window. A new-comer asked Watty what the  trouble was, and he said that the Army girl had only found her chap, or  husband, or long-lost brother or something, but the missus was looking  after the business; then he dozed again.    And then we adjourned to the Royal and took the Army with us.    \"That's the way of it,\" said Donald Macdonald. \"With a woman it's love  or religion; with a man it's love or the devil.\"    \"Or with a man,\" said Mitchell, presently, \"it's love and the devil  both, sometimes, Donald.\"    I looked at Mitchell hard, but for all his face expressed he might only  have said, \"I think it's going to rain.\"          \"LORD DOUGLAS\"        They hold him true, who's true to one,      However false he be.                            -The Rouseabout of Rouseabouts.      The Imperial Hotel was rather an unfortunate name for an out-back town  pub, for out back is the stronghold of Australian democracy; it was  the out-back vote and influence that brought about \"One Man One Vote,\"  \"Payment of Members,\" and most of the democratic legislation of late  years, and from out back came the overwhelming vote in favour of  Australian as Imperial Federation.    The name Royal Hotel is as familiar as that of the Railway Hotel, and  passes unnoticed and ungrowled at, even by bush republicans. The Royal  Hotel at Bourke was kept by an Irishman, one O'Donohoo, who was Union to  the backbone, loudly in favour of \"Australia for the Australians,\" and,  of course, against even the democratic New South Wales Government of the  time. He went round town all one St Patrick's morning with a bunch  of green ribbon fastened to his coat-tail with a large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#8)"],[1,"now,\" the captain said; \"we can head  her more to the south. We must be nearly abreast of the islands, and  according to my reckoning forty or fifty miles to the east of them.\"    It was now dark, and the watch was sent below.    \"To-morrow morning we shall be able to get some more sail on her,\" the  master said, \"and I hope by the next morning the squall will be over,  for we shall then have made our southing, and the wind will be right in  our teeth when we turn her head west. There is no saying which way it  will come when the squall dies out. What do you think, Johnson?\"    \"We are pretty sure to get it hot from one quarter or another,\" the man  said. \"I should say most likely from the south.\"    \"Except for the cold that would be better than west,\" Harry remarked.    \"Yes, if it is not too strong; but it is likely to be strong. After  such a gale as we have had, it seldom settles down for some time. As  like as not there will be bad weather for the next month.\"    The next morning when Harry went on deck he saw that the reefs had been  shaken out of the topsails and the spanker hoisted. There was still a  fresh wind, but it had backed round more to the south, and there was so  sharp a nip in it that he went below and put on a pea-jacket. Then he  beckoned to Bertie, who was off duty, to join him on the poop.    \"That has been a smart blow, Bertie.\"    \"Yes, but I had it worse than that the last time I came round the Horn.  I think we shall be shortening sail again before long. The clouds are  banking up to the south-west. She is a good sea-boat, isn't she?\"    \"She has behaved uncommonly well. We shall want all our clothes before  night, Bertie. It was May when we started, and it is nearly mid-winter  down here.\"    \"There is one thing, we shan't have so much risk of coming across  drifting icebergs, most of them will be frozen up hard and fast down in  the south. They don't matter much when the weather is clear, but if it  is thick one has an awful time of it. On my first voyage it was like  that, and I tell you I didn't think I was going to see England again.  We had some desperately close shaves.\"    The wind speedily freshened, and by evening the ship was under  close-reefed canvas again. The clouds were flying fast overhead and the  air was thick. Before the evening watch was set the ship was brought  round on the other tack, and was running to the east of south.    \"We will lie on this course till morning, Mr. Prendergast,\" said the  captain, \"and then if the wind holds, I think we shall be able to make  a long leg and weather the Horn.\"    For six days the storm raged with unabated violence. The cold was  intense, the spray breaking over the bows froze as it fell, and the  crew were engaged for hours at a time in breaking up the masses of ice  thus formed. Harry had volunteered to take a watch in turn with the  first and second mates. The captain was almost continuously on deck.  Twice they encountered icebergs, and once in a driving snow-storm  nearly ran foul of one. Fortunately it was daylight, and the whole crew  being on deck, they were able to put the vessel about just in time.  During this time the vessel had only gained a few miles' westing. All  on board were utterly exhausted with the struggle against the bitter  wind; their hands were sore and bleeding through pulling upon frozen  ropes, their faces inflamed, and their eyelids so swollen and sore that  they could scarcely see. Then the wind began to abate, and more sail  being got on the _Para_, she was able to lie her course.          CHAPTER III    AT LIMA      Three days later the sky cleared, and the captain, getting an  observation, found that they had rounded the southernmost point of the  Cape. Another day and the _Para's_ head was turned north, and a week  later they were running smoothly along before a gentle breeze, with the  coast of Chili twenty miles away. The heavy wraps had all been laid  aside, and although the air was still frosty, the crew felt it warm  after what they had endured. The upper spars and yards had all been  sent up, and she was now carrying a crowd of canvas. The mate had  thawed out under the more congenial surroundings. He had worked like a  horse during the storm, setting an example, whether in going aloft or  in the work of clearing off the ice from the bows, and even when his  watch was relieved he seldom went below.    \"Well, I hope, Mr. Johnson, we shall sail together until you get your  next step,\" the captain said. \"I could not wish for a better first  officer.\"    \"I want nothing better, sir. She is a fine ship, well manned and well  commanded. I begin to feel at home in her now; at first I didn't. I  hate changes; and though the last captain I sailed with was a surly  fellow, we got on very well together. I would rather sail with a man  like that than with a skipper who is always talking. I am a silent man  myself, and am quite content to eat my meal and enjoy it, without  having to stop every time I am putting my fork into my mouth to answer  some question or other. I was once six months up in the north without  ever speaking to a soul. I was whaling then, and a snow-storm came on  when we were fast on to a fish. It was twenty-four hours before it  cleared off, and when it did there was no ship to be seen. We were in  an inlet at the time in Baffin's Bay. We thought that the ship would  come back, and we landed and hauled up the boat. The ship didn't come  back, and, as I learned long afterwards, was never heard of again. I  suppose she got nipped between two icebergs.    \"Winter was coming on fast, and the men all agreed that they would  rather try and make their way south overland than stay there. I told  them that they were fools, but I admit that the prospect of a winter  there was enough to frighten any man. I did not like it myself, but I  thought it was wiser to remain there than to move. Some of the men went  along the shore, or out in the boat, and managed to kill several  sea-cows. They made a sledge, piled the meat on it, and started.    \"Meanwhile I had been busy building a sort of hut. I piled great stones  against the foot of the cliffs, and turned the boat upside down to form  a roof. The men helped me to do that job the last thing before they  started. Then I blocked up the entrance, leaving only just room for me  to crawl in and out. The snow began to fall steadily three days after  the others had gone, and very soon covered my hut two feet deep. I  melted the blubber of the whale in the boat's baler, for we had towed  the fish ashore. The first potful or two I boiled over a few bits of  drift-wood. After that it was easy enough, as I unravelled some of the  boat's rope, dipped it in the hot blubber, and made a store of big  candles. There was a lot of meat left on the sea-cows, so I cut that  up, froze it, and stowed as much as I could in the hut. I was bothered  about the rest, as I knew the bears were likely to come down; but I  found a ledge on the face of the perpendicular rock, and by putting the  boat's mast against it I was able to get up to it. Here I piled, I  should say, a ton of meat and blubber. Then I set to work and collected  some dried grass, and soon I had enough to serve as bed and covers. It  took me a month to do all this, and by that time winter was down on me  in earnest. I had spent my evenings in making myself, out of the skins  of the three cows, breeches, high boots, and a coat with a hood over  the head, and in order to make these soft I rubbed them with hot oil.  They were rough things, but I hoped that I might get a bear later on.  Fortunately the boat had two balers, for I required one in which to  melt the snow over the lamp.    \"Well, sir, I lived there during that winter. I did not find it  altogether dull, for I had several bits of excitement. For a month or  so bears and wolves came down and fought over the carcass of the whale.  When that was eaten up they turned their attention to me, and over and  over again they tried to break in. They had better have left me alone,  for though they were strong enough to have pulled away the rocks that  blocked the entrance, they could not stand fire. As I had any amount of  rope, I used to soak it in rock-oil, set it on fire, and shove it out  of the entrance. Twice small bears managed to wriggle up the passage,  but I had sharpened the boat-hook and managed to kill them both. One  skin made me a whole suit, and the other a first-rate blanket. Not that  it was ever unpleasantly cold, for a couple of my big candles, and the  thick coating of snow over it, kept the place as warm as I cared for.  Occasionally, when the bears had cleared off, I went out, climbed the  mast, and got fresh supplies down. They had made desperate efforts to  get at the meat, but the face of the rock was luckily too smooth for  them to get any hold. When spring came and the ice broke up, I planted  the mast on the top of the cliff with the sail fastened as a flag, and  a month after the sea was clear a whaler came in and took me off. That  was how I pretty well lost the use of my tongue, and though I am better  than I was, I don't use it much now except on duty.\"    \"That certainly accounts for it,\" Harry said; \"you must have had an  awful time.\"    \"I don't think I minded it very much, sir. Except when I was bothered  by the bears I slept a good lot. I think at first I used to talk out  loud a good deal. But I soon dropped that, though I used to whistle  sometimes when I was cooking the food. I don't think I should have held  on so long if I had only had the sea-cow flesh, but the bears made a  nice change, and I only wished that one or two more had managed to  crawl in.\"    \"I wonder you were able to kill them with a boat-hook.\"    \"I didn't, sir. You know every whaler carries an axe to cut the line if  necessary, and I was able to split their skulls as they crawled in  before they could get fairly on to their feet and use"]]]
