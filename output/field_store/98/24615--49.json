It seems to me that Turgenieff, as an artist, saw nothing in my father  beyond his great literary talent, and was unwilling to allow him the  right to be anything besides an artist and a writer. Any other line of  activity on my father's part offended Turgenieff, as it were, and he was  angry with my father because he did not follow his advice. He was much  older than my father, [18] he did not hesitate to rank his own talent  lower than my father's, and demanded only one thing of him, that he  should devote all the energies of his life to his literary work. And, lo  and behold! my father would have nothing to do with his magnanimity and  humility, would not listen to his advice, but insisted on going the road  which his own tastes and nature pointed out to him. Turgenieff's  tastes and character were diametrically opposed to my father's. While  opposition always inspired my father and lent him strength, it had just  the opposite effect on Turgenieff.    Being wholly in agreement with my sister's views, I will merely  supplement them with the words uttered by his brother, Nikolai  Nikolayevitch, who said that \"Turgenieff cannot reconcile himself to  the idea that Lyovotchka is growing up and freeing himself from his  tutelage.\"    As a matter of fact, when Turgenieff was already a famous writer, no  one had ever heard of Tolstoy, and, as Fet expressed it, there was only  \"something said about his stories from 'Childhood.'\"    I can imagine with what secret veneration a young writer, just  beginning, must have regarded Turgenieff at that time, and all the more  because Ivan Sergeyevitch was a great friend of my father's elder and  beloved brother Nikolai.    I do not like to assert it positively, but it seems to me that just  as Turgenieff was unwilling to confine himself to \"merely friendly  relations,\" so my father also felt too warmly toward Ivan Sergeyevitch,  and that was the very reason why they could never meet without  disagreeing and quarreling. In confirmation of what I say here is  a passage from a letter written by V. Botkin, a close friend of my  father's and of Ivan Sergeyevitch's, to A. A. Fet, written immediately  after their quarrel:      I think that Tolstoy really has a passionately affectionate nature  and he would like to love Turgenieff in the warmest way possible; but  unfortunately his impulsive feeling encounters nothing but a kindly,  good-natured indifference, and he can by no means reconcile himself to  that.      Turgenieff himself said that when they first came to know each other my  father dogged his heels \"like a woman in love,\" and at one time he used  to avoid him, because he was afraid of his spirit of opposition.    My father was perhaps irritated by the slightly patronizing tone which  Turgenieff adopted from the very outset of their acquaintance; and  Turgenieff was irritated by my father's \"crankiness,\" which distracted  him from \"his proper metier, literature.\"    In 1870, before the date of the quarrel, Turgenieff wrote to Fet:    \"Lyoff Tolstoy continues to play the crank. It was evidently written in  his stars. When will he turn his last somersault and stand on his feet  at last?\"    Turgenieff was just the same about my father's \"Confession,\" which he  read not long before his death. Having promised to read it, \"to try to  understand it,\" and \"not to lose my temper,\" he \"started to write a long  letter in answer to the 'Confession,' but never finished it... for fear  of becoming disputatious.\"    In a letter to D. V. Grigorevitch he called the book, which was based,  in his opinion, on false premises, \"a denial of all live human life\" and  \"a new sort of Nihilism.\"    It is evident that even then Turgenieff did not understand what a  mastery my father's new philosophy of life had obtained over him, and he  was inclined to attribute his enthusiasm along with the rest to the  same perpetual \"crankinesses\" and \"somersaults\" to which he had formerly  attributed his interest in school-teaching, agriculture, the publication  of a paper, and so forth.      IVAN SERGEYEVITCH three times visited Yasnaya Polyana within my memory,  in: August and September, 1878, and the third and last time at the  beginning of May, 1880. I can remember all these visits, although it is  quite possible that some details have escaped me.    I remember that when we expected Turgenieff on his first visit, it was  a great occasion, and the most anxious and excited of all the household  about it was my mother. She told us that my father had quarreled with  Turgenieff and had once challenged him to a duel, and that he was now  coming at my father's invitation to effect a reconciliation.    Turgenieff spent all the time sitting with my father, who during his  visit put aside even his work, and once in the middle of the day my  mother collected us all at a quite unusual hour in the drawing-room,  where Ivan Sergeyevitch read us his story of \"The Dog.\"    I can remember his tall, stalwart figure, his gray, silky, yellowish  hair, his soft tread, rather waddling walk, and his piping voice, quite  out of keeping with his majestic exterior. He had a chuckling kind of  laugh, like a child's, and when he laughed his voice was more piping  than ever.    In the evening, after dinner, we all gathered in the zala. At that time  Uncle Seryozha, Prince Leonid Dmitryevitch Urusof, Vice-Governor of the  Province of Tula; Uncle Sasha Behrs and his young wife, the handsome  Georgian Patty; and the whole family of the Kuzminskys, were staying at  Yasnaya.    Aunt Tanya was asked to sing. We listened with beating hearts, and  waited to hear what Turgenieff, the famous connoisseur, would say about  her singing. Of course he praised it, sincerely, I think. After the  singing a quadrille was got up. All of a sudden, in the middle of the  quadrille, Ivan Sergeyevitch, who was sitting at one side looking on,  got up and took one of the ladies by the hand, and, putting his thumbs  into the armholes of his waistcoat, danced a cancan according to the  latest rules of Parisian art. Everyone roared with laughter, Turgenieff  more than anybody.    After tea the \"grown-ups\" started some conversation, and a warm dispute  arose among them. It was Prince Urusof who disputed most warmly, and  \"went for\" Turgenieff.    Of Turgenieff's third visit I remember the woodcock shooting. This was  on the second or third of May, 1880.    We all went out together beyond the Voronka, my father, my mother and  all the children. My father gave Turgenieff the best place and posted  himself one hundred and fifty paces away at the other end of the same  glade.    My mother stood by Turgenieff, and we children lighted a bonfire not far  off.    My father fired several shots and brought down two birds; Ivan  Sergeyevitch had no luck, and was envying my father's good fortune all  the time. At last, when it was beginning to get dark, a woodcock flew  over Turgenieff, and he shot it.    \"Killed it?\" called out my father.    \"Fell like a stone; send your dog to pick him up,\" answered Ivan  Sergeyevitch.    My father sent us with the dog, Turgenieff showed us where to look  for the bird; but search as we might, and the dog, too, there was no  woodcock to be found. At last Turgenieff came to help, and my father  came; there was no woodcock there.    \"Perhaps you only winged it; it may have got away along the ground,\"  said my father, puzzled. \"It is impossible that the dog shouldn't find  it; he couldn't miss a bird that was killed.\"    \"I tell you I saw it with my own eyes, Lyoff Nikolaievich; it fell  like a stone. I didn't wound it; I killed it outright. I can tell the  difference.\"    \"Then why can't the dog find it? It's impossible; there's something  wrong.\"    \"I don't know anything about that,\" insisted Turgenieff. \"You may take  it from me I'm not lying; it fell like a stone where I tell you.\"    There was no finding the woodcock, and the incident left an unpleasant  flavor, as if one or the other of them was in the wrong. Either  Turgenieff was bragging when he said that he shot it dead, or my father,  in maintaining that the dog could not fail to find a bird that had been  killed.    And this must needs happen just when they were both so anxious to avoid  every sort of misunderstanding! That was the very reason why they had  carefully fought shy of all serious conversation, and spent all their  time merely amusing themselves.    When my father said good night to us that night, he whispered to us that  we were to get up early and go back to the place to have a good hunt for  the bird.    And what was the result? The woodcock, in falling, had caught in the  fork of a branch, right at the top of an aspen-tree, and it was all we  could do to knock it out from there.    When we brought it home in triumph, it was something of an \"occasion,\"  and my father and Turgenieff were far more delighted than we were. It  turned out that they were both in the right, and everything ended to  their mutual satisfaction.    Ivan Sergeyevitch slept down-stairs in my father's study. When the party  broke up for the night, I used to see him to his room, and while he was  undressing I sat on his bed and talked sport with him.    He asked me if I could shoot. I said yes, but that I didn't care to go  out shooting because I had nothing but a rotten old one-barreled gun.    \"I'll give you a gun,\" he said. \"I've got two in Paris, and I have no  earthly need for both. It's not an expensive gun, but it's a good one.  Next time I come to Russia I'll bring it with me.\"    I was quite taken aback and thanked him heartily. I was tremendously  delighted at the idea that I was to have a real central-fire gun.    Unfortunately, Turgenieff never came to Russia again. I tried afterward  to buy the gun he had spoken of from his legatees not in the quality of  a central-fire gun, but as Turgenieff's gun;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#8)"],[1,"slowly down the river towards the fort, the  commander asked with much more interest than a question in ordinary  conversation is asked, where was I on the night of the first of May? On  telling him that I was at an Indian settlement a little below the great  fall in the Demerara, and that a strange and sudden noise had alarmed  all the Indians, he said the same astonishing noise had roused every  man in Fort St. Joachim, and that they remained under arms till  morning. He observed that he had been quite at a loss to form any idea  what could have caused the noise; but now learning that the same noise  had been heard at the same time far away from the Rio Branco, it struck  him there must have been an earthquake somewhere or other.    Good nourishment and rest, and the unwearied attention and kindness of  the Portuguese commander, stopped the progress of the fever and enabled  me to walk about in six days.    Fort St. Joachim was built about five and forty years ago under the  apprehension, it is said, that the Spaniards were coming from the Rio  Negro to settle there. It has been much neglected; the floods of water  have carried away the gate and destroyed the wall on each side of it,  but the present commander is putting it into thorough repair. When  finished it will mount six nine- and six twelve-pounders.    In a straight line with the fort, and within a few yards of the river,  stand the commander's house, the barracks, the chapel, the  father-confessor's house and two others, all at little intervals from  each other; and these are the only buildings at Fort St. Joachim. The  neighbouring extensive plains afford good pasturage for a fine breed of  cattle, and the Portuguese make enough of butter and cheese for their  own consumption.    On asking the old officer if there were such a place as Lake Parima, or  El Dorado, he replied he looked upon it as imaginary altogether. \"I  have been above forty years,\" added he, \"in Portuguese Guiana, but have  never yet met with anybody who has seen the lake.\"    So much for Lake Parima, or El Dorado, or the White Sea. Its existence  at best seems doubtful: some affirm that there is such a place and  others deny it.      Grammatici certant, et adhuc sub judice lis est.    Having now reached the Portuguese inland frontier and collected a  sufficient quantity of the wourali poison, nothing remains but to give  a brief account of its composition, its effects, its uses and its  supposed antidotes.    It has been already remarked that in the extensive wilds of Demerara  and Essequibo, far away from any European settlement, there is a tribe  of Indians who are known by the name of Macoushi.    Though the wourali poison is used by all the South American savages  betwixt the Amazons and the Oroonoque, still this tribe makes it  stronger than any of the rest. The Indians in the vicinity of the Rio  Negro are aware of this, and come to the Macoushi country to purchase  it.    Much has been said concerning this fatal and extraordinary poison. Some  have affirmed that its effects are almost instantaneous, provided the  minutest particle of it mixes with the blood; and others again have  maintained that it is not strong enough to kill an animal of the size  and strength of a man. The first have erred by lending a too willing  ear to the marvellous and believing assertions without sufficient  proof. The following short story points out the necessity of a cautious  examination.    One day, on asking an Indian if he thought the poison would kill a man,  he replied that they always go to battle with it; that he was standing  by when an Indian was shot with a poisoned arrow, and that he expired  almost immediately. Not wishing to dispute this apparently satisfactory  information the subject was dropped.    However, about an hour after, having purposely asked him in what part  of the body the said Indian was wounded, he answered without hesitation  that the arrow entered betwixt his shoulders and passed quite through  his heart. Was it the weapon or the strength of the poison that brought  on immediate dissolution in this case? Of course the weapon.    The second have been misled by disappointment caused by neglect in  keeping the poisoned arrows, or by not knowing how to use them, or by  trying inferior poison. If the arrows are not kept dry the poison loses  its strength, and in wet or damp weather it turns mouldy and becomes  quite soft. In shooting an arrow in this state, upon examining the  place where it has entered, it will be observed that, though the arrow  has penetrated deep into the flesh, still by far the greatest part of  the poison has shrunk back, and thus, instead of entering with the  arrow, it has remained collected at the mouth of the wound. In this  case the arrow might as well have not been poisoned. Probably it was to  this that a gentleman, some time ago, owed his disappointment when he  tried the poison on a horse in the town of Stabroek, the capital of  Demerara; the horse never betrayed the least symptom of being affected  by it.    Wishful to obtain the best information concerning this poison, and as  repeated inquiries, in lieu of dissipating the surrounding shade, did  but tend more and more to darken the little light that existed, I  determined to penetrate into the country where the poisonous  ingredients grow, where this pernicious composition is prepared and  where it is constantly used. Success attended the adventure, and the  information acquired made amends for one hundred and twenty days passed  in the solitudes of Guiana, and afforded a balm to the wounds and  bruises which every traveller must expect to receive who wanders  through a thorny and obstructed path.    Thou must not, courteous reader, expect a dissertation on the manner in  which the wourali poison operates on the system: a treatise has been  already written on the subject, and, after all, there is probably still  reason to doubt. It is supposed to affect the nervous system, and thus  destroy the vital functions; it is also said to be perfectly harmless  provided it does not touch the blood. However, this is certain: when a  sufficient quantity of it enters the blood, death is the inevitable  consequence; but there is no alteration in the colour of the blood, and  both the blood and flesh may be eaten with safety.    All that thou wilt find here is a concise, unadorned account of the  wourali poison. It may be of service to thee some time or other  shouldst thou ever travel through the wilds where it is used. Neither  attribute to cruelty, nor to a want of feeling for the sufferings of  the inferior animals, the ensuing experiments. The larger animals were  destroyed in order to have proof positive of the strength of a poison  which hath hitherto been doubted, and the smaller ones were killed with  the hope of substantiating that which has commonly been supposed to be  an antidote.    It makes a pitying heart ache to see a poor creature in distress and  pain; and too often has the compassionate traveller occasion to heave a  sigh as he journeys on. However, here, though the kind-hearted will be  sorry to read of an unoffending animal doomed to death in order to  satisfy a doubt, still it will be a relief to know that the victim was  not tortured. The wourali poison destroys life's action so gently that  the victim appears to be in no pain whatever; and probably, were the  truth known, it feels none, saving the momentary smart at the time the  arrow enters.    A day or two before the Macoushi Indian prepares his poison he goes  into the forest in quest of the ingredients. A vine grows in these  wilds which is called wourali. It is from this that the poison takes  its name, and it is the principal ingredient. When he has procured  enough of this he digs up a root of a very bitter taste, ties them  together, and then looks about for two kinds of bulbous plants which  contain a green and glutinous juice. He fills a little quake which he  carries on his back with the stalks of these; and lastly ranges up and  down till he finds two species of ants. One of them is very large and  black, and so venomous that its sting produces a fever: it is most  commonly to be met with on the ground. The other is a little red ant  which stings like a nettle, and generally has its nest under the leaf  of a shrub. After obtaining these he has no more need to range the  forest.    A quantity of the strongest Indian pepper is used, but this he has  already planted round his hut. The pounded fangs of the labarri snake  and those of the counacouchi are likewise added. These he commonly has  in store, for when he kills a snake he generally extracts the fangs and  keeps them by him.    Having thus found the necessary ingredients, he scrapes the wourali  vine and bitter root into thin shavings and puts them into a kind of  colander made of leaves. This he holds over an earthen pot, and pours  water on the shavings: the liquor which comes through has the  appearance of coffee. When a sufficient quantity has been procured the  shavings are thrown aside. He then bruises the bulbous stalks and  squeezes a proportionate quantity of their juice through his hands into  the pot. Lastly the snakes' fangs, ants and pepper are bruised and  thrown into it. It is then placed on a slow fire, and as it boils more  of the juice of the wourali is added, according as it may be found  necessary, and the scum is taken off with a leaf: it remains on the  fire till reduced to a thick syrup of a deep brown colour. As soon as  it has arrived at this state a few arrows are poisoned with it, to try  its strength. If it answer the expectations it is poured out into a  calabash, or little pot of Indian manufacture, which is carefully  covered with a couple of leaves, and over them a piece of deer's skin  tied round with a cord. They keep it in the most dry part of the hut,  and from time to time suspend it over the fire to counteract the "]]]
