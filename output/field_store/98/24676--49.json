Several times, I saw the moonlight gleam on  running, white figures among the bushes, and, twice, I fired. The second  time, my shot was answered by a short squeal of pain.    A minute later, the gardens lay silent. From the Pit, came a deep,  hoarse Babel of swine-talk. At times, angry cries smote the air, and  they would be answered by multitudinous gruntings. It occurred to me,  that they were holding some kind of a council, perhaps to discuss the  problem of entering the house. Also, I thought that they seemed much  enraged, probably by my successful shots.    It occurred to me, that now would be a good time to make a final survey  of our defenses. This, I proceeded to do at once; visiting the whole of  the basement again, and examining each of the doors. Luckily, they are  all, like the back one, built of solid, iron-studded oak. Then, I went  upstairs to the study. I was more anxious about this door. It is,  palpably, of a more modern make than the others, and, though a stout  piece of work, it has little of their ponderous strength.    I must explain here, that there is a small, raised lawn on this side of  the house, upon which this door opens--the windows of the study being  barred on this account. All the other entrances--excepting the great  gateway which is never opened--are in the lower storey.        _VII_    THE ATTACK    I spent some time, puzzling how to strengthen the study door. Finally,  I went down to the kitchen, and with some trouble, brought up several  heavy pieces of timber. These, I wedged up, slantwise, against it, from  the floor, nailing them top and bottom. For half-an-hour, I worked hard,  and, at last, got it shored to my mind.    Then, feeling easier, I resumed my coat, which I had laid aside, and  proceeded to attend to one or two matters before returning to the tower.  It was whilst thus employed, that I heard a fumbling at the door, and  the latch was tried. Keeping silence, I waited. Soon, I heard several of  the creatures outside. They were grunting to one another, softly. Then,  for a minute, there was quietness. Suddenly, there sounded a quick, low  grunt, and the door creaked under a tremendous pressure. It would have  burst inward; but for the supports I had placed. The strain ceased, as  quickly as it had begun, and there was more talk.    Presently, one of the Things squealed, softly, and I heard the sound  of others approaching. There was a short confabulation; then again,  silence; and I realized that they had called several more to assist.  Feeling that now was the supreme moment, I stood ready, with my rifle  presented. If the door gave, I would, at least, slay as many  as possible.    Again came the low signal; and, once more, the door cracked, under a  huge force. For, a minute perhaps, the pressure was kept up; and I  waited, nervously; expecting each moment to see the door come down with  a crash. But no; the struts held, and the attempt proved abortive. Then  followed more of their horrible, grunting talk, and, whilst it lasted, I  thought I distinguished the noise of fresh arrivals.    After a long discussion, during which the door was several times  shaken, they became quiet once more, and I knew that they were going to  make a third attempt to break it down. I was almost in despair. The  props had been severely tried in the two previous attacks, and I was  sorely afraid that this would prove too much for them.    At that moment, like an inspiration, a thought flashed into my troubled  brain. Instantly, for it was no time to hesitate, I ran from the room,  and up stair after stair. This time, it was not to one of the towers,  that I went; but out on to the flat, leaded roof itself. Once there, I  raced across to the parapet, that walls it 'round, and looked down. As I  did so, I heard the short, grunted signal, and, even up there, caught  the crying of the door under the assault.    There was not a moment to lose, and, leaning over, I aimed, quickly,  and fired. The report rang sharply, and, almost blending with it, came  the loud splud of the bullet striking its mark. From below, rose a  shrill wail; and the door ceased its groaning. Then, as I took my weight  from off the parapet, a huge piece of the stone coping slid from under  me, and fell with a crash among the disorganized throng beneath.  Several horrible shrieks quavered through the night air, and then I  heard a sound of scampering feet. Cautiously, I looked over. In the  moonlight, I could see the great copingstone, lying right across the  threshold of the door. I thought I saw something under it--several  things, white; but I could not be sure.    And so a few minutes passed.    As I stared, I saw something come 'round, out of the shadow of the  house. It was one of the Things. It went up to the stone, silently, and  bent down. I was unable to see what it did. In a minute it stood up. It  had something in its talons, which it put to its mouth and tore at....    For the moment, I did not realize. Then, slowly, I comprehended. The  Thing was stooping again. It was horrible. I started to load my rifle.  When I looked again, the monster was tugging at the stone--moving it to  one side. I leant the rifle on the coping, and pulled the trigger. The  brute collapsed, on its face, and kicked, slightly.    Simultaneously, almost, with the report, I heard another sound--that of  breaking glass. Waiting, only to recharge my weapon, I ran from the  roof, and down the first two flights of stairs.    Here, I paused to listen. As I did so, there came another tinkle of  falling glass. It appeared to come from the floor below. Excitedly, I  sprang down the steps, and, guided by the rattle of the window-sash,  reached the door of one of the empty bedrooms, at the back of the house.  I thrust it open. The room was but dimly illuminated by the moonlight;  most of the light being blotted out by moving figures at the window.  Even as I stood, one crawled through, into the room. Leveling my weapon,  I fired point-blank at it--filling the room with a deafening bang. When  the smoke cleared, I saw that the room was empty, and the window free.  The room was much lighter. The night air blew in, coldly, through the  shattered panes. Down below, in the night, I could hear a soft moaning,  and a confused murmur of swine-voices.    Stepping to one side of the window, I reloaded, and then stood there,  waiting. Presently, I heard a scuffling noise. From where I stood in the  shadow, I could see, without being seen.    Nearer came the sounds, and then I saw something come up above the  sill, and clutch at the broken window-frame. It caught a piece of the  woodwork; and, now, I could make out that it was a hand and arm. A  moment later, the face of one of the Swine-creatures rose into view.  Then, before I could use my rifle, or do anything, there came a sharp  crack--cr-ac-k; and the window-frame gave way under the weight of the  Thing. Next instant, a squashing thud, and a loud outcry, told me that  it had fallen to the ground. With a savage hope that it had been killed,  I went to the window. The moon had gone behind a cloud, so that I could  see nothing; though a steady hum of jabbering, just beneath where I  stood, indicated that there were several more of the brutes close  at hand.    As I stood there, looking down, I marveled how it had been possible for  the creatures to climb so far; for the wall is comparatively smooth,  while the distance to the ground must be, at least, eighty feet.    All at once, as I bent, peering, I saw something, indistinctly, that  cut the grey shadow of the house-side, with a black line. It passed the  window, to the left, at a distance of about two feet. Then, I remembered  that it was a gutter-pipe, that had been put there some years ago, to  carry off the rainwater. I had forgotten about it. I could see, now, how  the creatures had managed to reach the window. Even as the solution came  to me, I heard a faint slithering, scratching noise, and knew that  another of the brutes was coming. I waited some odd moments; then leant  out of the window and felt the pipe. To my delight, I found that it was  quite loose, and I managed, using the rifle-barrel as a crowbar, to  lever it out from the wall. I worked quickly. Then, taking hold with  both bands, I wrenched the whole concern away, and hurled it down--with  the Thing still clinging to it--into the garden.    For a few minutes longer, I waited there, listening; but, after the  first general outcry, I heard nothing. I knew, now, that there was no  more reason to fear an attack from this quarter. I had removed the only  means of reaching the window, and, as none of the other windows had any  adjacent water pipes, to tempt the climbing powers of the monsters, I  began to feel more confident of escaping their clutches.    Leaving the room, I made my way down to the study. I was anxious to see  how the door had withstood the test of that last assault. Entering, I  lit two of the candles, and then turned to the door. One of the large  props had been displaced, and, on that side, the door had been forced  inward some six inches.    It was Providential that I had managed to drive the brutes away just  when I did! And that copingstone! I wondered, vaguely, how I had managed  to dislodge it. I had not noticed it loose, as I took my shot; and then,  as I stood up, it had slipped away from beneath me ... I felt that I  owed the dismissal of the attacking force, more to its timely fall than  to my rifle. Then the thought came, that I had better seize this chance  to shore up the door, again. It was evident that the creatures had not  returned since the fall of the copingstone; but who was to say how long  they would keep away?    There and then, I set-to, at repairing the door--working hard and  anxiously."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10011"],[0,"365 Foreign Dishes (#9)"],[1,"n.
