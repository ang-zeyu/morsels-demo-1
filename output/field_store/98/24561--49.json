It seemed incredible that he had not foreseen what must  happen.    Love comes to some gently, imperceptibly, creeping in as the tide,  through unsuspected creeks and inlets, creeps on a sleeping man, until  he wakes to find himself surrounded. But to others it comes as a wave,  breaking on them, beating them down, whirling them away.    It was so with John. In that instant when their eyes met the miracle  must have happened. It seemed to him, as he recalled the scene now,  that he had loved her before he had had time to frame his first remark.  It amazed him that he could ever have been blind to the fact that he  loved her, she was so obviously the only girl in the world.    \"You--you don't remember me,\" he stammered.    She was flushing a little under his stare, but her eyes were shining.    \"I remember you very well, Mr. Maude,\" she said with a smile. \"I  thought I knew your shoulders before you turned round. What are you  doing here?\"    \"I--\"    There was a hush. The _croupier_ had set the ball rolling. A  wizened little man and two ladies of determined aspect were looking up  disapprovingly. John realized that he was the only person in the room  not silent. It was impossible to tell her the story of the change in  his fortunes in the middle of this crowd. He stopped, and the moment  passed.    The ball dropped with a rattle. The tension relaxed.    \"Won't you take this seat?\" said John.    \"No, thank you. I'm not playing. I only just stopped to look on. My  aunt is in one of the rooms, and I want to make her come home. I'm  tired.\"    \"Have you--?\"    He caught the eye of the wizened man, and stopped again.    \"Have you been in Mervo long?\" he said, as the ball fell.    \"I only arrived this morning. It seems lovely. I must explore  to-morrow.\"    She was beginning to move off.    \"Er--\" John coughed to remove what seemed to him a deposit of sawdust  and unshelled nuts in his throat. \"Er--may I--will you let me show  you--\" prolonged struggle with the nuts and sawdust; then  rapidly--\"some of the places to-morrow?\"    He had hardly spoken the words when it was borne in upon him that he  was a vulgar, pushing bounder, presuming on a dead and buried  acquaintanceship to force his company on a girl who naturally did not  want it, and who would now proceed to snub him as he deserved. He  quailed. Though he had not had time to collect and examine and label  his feelings, he was sufficiently in touch with them to know that a  snub from her would be the most terrible thing that could possibly  happen to him.    She did not snub him. Indeed, if he had been in a state of mind  coherent enough to allow him to observe, he might have detected in her  eyes and her voice signs of pleasure.    \"I should like it very much,\" she said.    John made his big effort. He attacked the nuts and sawdust which had  come back and settled down again in company with a large lump of some  unidentified material, as if he were bucking center. They broke before  him as, long ago, the Yale line had done, and his voice rang out as if  through a megaphone, to the unconcealed disgust of the neighboring  gamesters.    \"If you go along the path at the foot of the hill,\" he bellowed  rapidly, \"and follow it down to the sea, you get a little bay full of  red sandstone rocks--you can't miss it--and there's a fine view of the  island from there. I'd like awfully well to show that to you. It's  great.\"    She nodded.    \"Then shall we meet there?\" she said. \"When?\"    John was in no mood to postpone the event.    \"As early as ever you like,\" he roared.    \"At about ten, then. Good-night, Mr. Maude.\"           *       *       *       *       *    John had reached the bay at half-past eight, and had been on guard  there ever since. It was now past ten, but still there were no signs of  Betty. His depression increased. He told himself that she had  forgotten. Then, that she had remembered, but had changed her mind.  Then, that she had never meant to come at all. He could not decide  which of the three theories was the most distressing.    His mood became morbidly introspective. He was weighed down by a sense  of his own unworthiness. He submitted himself to a thorough  examination, and the conclusion to which he came was that, as an  aspirant to the regard, of a girl like Betty, he did not score a single  point. No wonder she had ignored the appointment.    A cold sweat broke out on him. This was the snub! She had not  administered it in the Casino simply in order that, by being delayed,  its force might be the more overwhelming.    He looked at his watch again, and the world grew black. It was twelve  minutes after ten.    John, in his time, had thought and read a good deal about love. Ever  since he had grown up, he had wanted to fall in love. He had imagined  love as a perpetual exhilaration, something that flooded life with a  golden glow as if by the pressing of a button or the pulling of a  switch, and automatically removed from it everything mean and hard and  uncomfortable; a something that made a man feel grand and god-like,  looking down (benevolently, of course) on his fellow men as from some  lofty mountain.    That it should make him feel a worm-like humility had not entered his  calculations. He was beginning to see something of the possibilities of  love. His tentative excursions into the unknown emotion, while at  college, had never really deceived him; even at the time a sort of  second self had looked on and sneered at the poor imitation.    This was different. This had nothing to do with moonlight and soft  music. It was raw and hard. It hurt. It was a thing sharp and jagged,  tearing at the roots of his soul.    He turned his head, and looked up the path for the hundredth time, and  this time he sprang to his feet. Between the pines on the hillside his  eye had caught the flutter of a white dress.          CHAPTER VII    MR. SCOBELL IS FRANK      Much may happen in these rapid times in the course of an hour and a  half. While John was keeping his vigil on the sandstone rock, Betty was  having an interview with Mr. Scobell which was to produce far-reaching  results, and which, incidentally, was to leave her angrier and more at  war with the whole of her world than she could remember to have been in  the entire course of her life.    The interview began, shortly after breakfast, in a gentle and tactful  manner, with Aunt Marion at the helm. But Mr. Scobell was not the man  to stand by silently while persons were being tactful. At the end of  the second minute he had plunged through his sister's mild monologue  like a rhinoceros through a cobweb, and had stated definitely, with an  economy of words, the exact part which Betty was to play in Mervian  affairs.    \"You say you want to know why you were cabled for. I'll tell you.  There's no use talking for half a day before you get to the point. I  guess you've heard that there's a prince here instead of a republic  now? Well, that's where you come in.\"    \"Do you mean--?\" she hesitated.    \"Yes, I do,\" said Mr. Scobell. There was a touch of doggedness in his  voice. He was not going to stand any nonsense, by Heck, but there was  no doubt that Betty's wide-open eyes were not very easy to meet. He  went on rapidly. \"Cut out any fool notions about romance.\" Miss  Scobell, who was knitting a sock, checked her needles for a moment in  order to sigh. Her brother eyed her morosely, then resumed his remarks.  \"This is a matter of state. That's it. You gotta cut out fool notions  and act for good of state. You gotta look at it in the proper spirit.  Great honor--see what I mean? Princess and all that. Chance of a  lifetime--dynasty--you gotta look at it that way.\"    Miss Scobell heaved another sigh, and dropped a stitch.    \"For the love of Mike,\" said her brother, irritably, \"don't snort like  that, Marion.\"    \"Very well, dear.\"    Betty had not taken her eyes off him from his first word. An unbiased  observer would have said that she made a pretty picture, standing  there, in her white dress, but in the matter of pictures, still life  was evidently what Mr. Scobell preferred for his gaze never wandered  from the cigar stump which he had removed from his mouth in order to  knock off the ash.    Betty continued to regard him steadfastly. The shock of his words had  to some extent numbed her. At this moment she was merely thinking,  quite dispassionately, what a singularly nasty little man he looked,  and wondering--not for the first time--what strange quality, invisible  to everybody else, it had been in him that had made her mother his  adoring slave during the whole of their married life.    Then her mind began to work actively once more. She was a Western girl,  and an insistence on freedom was the first article in her creed. A  great rush of anger filled her, that this man should set himself up to  dictate to her.    \"Do you mean that you want me to marry this Prince?\" she said.    \"That's right.\"    \"I won't do anything of the sort.\"    \"Pshaw! Don't be foolish. You make me tired.\"    Betty's eye shone mutinously. Her cheeks were flushed, and her slim,  boyish figure quivered. Her chin, always determined, became a silent  Declaration of Independence.    \"I won't,\" she said.    Aunt Marion, suspending operations on the sock, went on with tact at  the point where her brother's interruption had forced her to leave off.    \"I'm sure he's a very nice young man. I have not seen him, but  everybody says so. You like him, Bennie, don't you?\"    \"Sure, I like him. He's a corker. Wait till you see him, Betty.  Nobody's asking you to marry him before lunch. You'll have plenty of  time to get acquainted. It beats me what you're kicking at. You give me  a pain in the neck. Be reasonable.\"    Betty sought for arguments to clinch her refusal.    \"It's ridiculous,\" she said. \"You talk as if you had just to wave your  hand. Why should "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#8)"],[1," a  festival of the Home, Tabernacles of the Synagogue. In Europe the habit  of actually dwelling in booths has been long unusual, owing to climatic  considerations. But of late years it has become customary for every  Synagogue to raise its communal booth, to which many Jews pay visits of  ceremony. On the other hand, the Passover is _par excellence_ a home  rite. On the first two evenings (or at all events on the first evening)  there takes place the _Seder_, (literally 'service'), a service of  prayer, which is at the same time a family meal. Gathered round the table,  on which are spread unleavened cakes, bitter herbs, and other emblems of  joy and sorrow, the family recounts in prose and song the narrative of  the Exodus. The service is in two parts, between which comes the evening  meal. The hallowing of the home here attains its highest point.    Unless, indeed, this distinction be allotted to the Sabbath. The  rigidity of the laws regarding Sabbath observance is undeniable. Movement  was restricted, many acts were forbidden which were not in themselves  laborious. The Sabbath was hedged in by a formidable array of enactments.  To an outside critic it is not wonderful that the Jewish Sabbath has  a repellent look. But to the insider things wear another aspect.  The Sabbath was and is a day of delight. On it the Jew had a foretaste  of the happiness of the world to come. The reader who wishes to have a  spirited, and absolutely true, picture of the Jewish Sabbath cannot do  better than turn to Dr. Schechter's excellent _Studies in Judaism_  (pp. 296 _seq._). As Dr. Schechter pithily puts it: 'Somebody,  either the learned professors, or the millions of the Jewish people,  must be under a delusion.' Right through the Middle Ages the Sabbath grew  deeper into the affections of the Jews. It was not till after the French  Revolution and the era of emancipation, that a change occurred. Mixing  with the world, and sharing the world's pursuits, the Jews began to  find it hard to observe the Saturday Sabbath as of old. In still more  recent times the difficulty has increased. Added to this, the growing  laxity in observances has affected the Sabbath. This is one of the most  pressing problems that face the Jewish community to-day. Here and there  an attempt has been made by small sections of Jews to substitute a Sunday  Sabbath for the Saturday Sabbath. But the plan has not prospered.    One of the most notable rites of the Service of the Passover eve is the  sanctification with wine, a ceremony common to the ordinary Sabbath eve.  This rite has perhaps had much to do with the characteristic sobriety  of Israel. Wine forms part of almost every Jewish rite, including the  marriage ceremony. Wine thus becomes associated with religion, and  undue indulgence is a sin as well as a vice. 'No joy without wine,'  runs an old Rabbinic prescription. Joy is the hallmark of Judaism;  'Joyous Service' its summary of man's relation to the Law. So far is  Judaism from being a gloomy religion, that it is almost too light-hearted,  just as was the religion of ancient Greece. But the Talmud tells us of a  class who in the early part of the first century were known as 'lovers  of sorrow.' These men were in love with misfortune; for to every trial  of Israel corresponded an intervention of the divine salvation. This is  the secret of the Jewish gaiety. The resilience under tribulation was  the result of a firm confidence in the saving fidelity of God. And the  gaiety was tempered by solemnity, as the observances, to which we now  turn, will amply show.    Far more remarkable than anything yet discussed is the change effected in  two other holy days since Bible times. The genius of Judaism is nowhere  more conspicuous than in the fuller meanings which have been infused  into the New Year's Day and the Day of Atonement. The New Year is the  first day of the seventh month (Tishri), when the ecclesiastical year  began. In the Bible the festival is only known as a 'day of blowing the  shofar' (ram's horn). In the Synagogue this rite was retained after  the destruction of the Temple, and it still is universally observed.  But the day was transformed into a Day of Judgment, the opening of a  ten days' period of Penitence which closed with the Day of Atonement.    Here, too, the change effected in a biblical rite transformed  its character. 'It needed a long upward development before a day,  originally instituted on priestly ideas of national sin and collective  atonement, could be transformed into the purely spiritual festival which  we celebrate to-day' (Montefiore, _op. cit._, p. 160). But the day  is none the less associated with a strict rite, the fast. It is one of  the few ascetic ceremonies in the Jewish Calendar as known to most Jews.  There is a strain of asceticism in some forms of Judaism, and on this  a few words will be said later. But, on the whole, there is in modern  Judaism a tendency to underrate somewhat the value of asceticism in  religion. Hence the fast has a distinct importance in and for itself,  and it is regrettable that the laudable desire to spiritualise the day  is leading to a depreciation of the fast as such. But the real change  is due to the cessation of sacrifices. In the Levitical Code, sacrifice  had a primary importance in the scheme of atonement. But with the loss  of the Temple, the idea of sacrifice entirely vanished, and atonement  became a matter for the personal conscience. It was henceforth an inward  sense of sin translating itself into the better life. 'To purify desire,  to ennoble the will--this is the essential condition of atonement. Nay,  it is atonement' (Joseph, _Judaism as Creed and Life_, p. 267;  cf. _supra_, p. 45). This, in the opinion of Christian theologians,  is a shallow view of atonement. But it is at all events an attempt to  apply theology to life. And its justification lies in its success.    Of the other festivals a word is due concerning two of them, which  differ much in significance and in development. Purim and Chanuka are  their names. Purim was probably the ancient Babylonian Saturnalia, and  it is still observed as a kind of Carnival by many Jews, though their  number is decreasing. For Purim is emphatically a Ghetto feast. And this  description applies in more ways than one. In the first place, the Book  of Esther, with which the Jewish Purim is associated, is not a book that  commends itself to the modern Jewish consciousness. The historicity of  the story is doubted, and its narrow outlook is not that of prophetic  Judaism. Observed as mediaeval Jews observed it, Purim was a thoroughly  innocent festivity. The unpleasant taste left by the closing scenes of the  book was washed off by the geniality of temper which saw the humours of  Haman's fall and never for a moment rested in a feeling of vindictiveness.  But the whole book breathes so nationalistic a spirit, so uncompromising  a belief that the enemy of Israel must be the enemy of God, that it has  become difficult for modern Judaism to retain any affection for it. It  makes its appeal to the persecuted, no doubt: it conveys a stirring lesson  in the providential care with which God watches over His people: it bids  the sufferer hope. Esther's splendid surrender of self, her immortal  declaration, 'If I perish, I perish,' still may legitimately thrill all  hearts. But the Carnival has no place in the life of a Western city,  still less the sectional Carnival. The hobby-horse had its opportunity  and the maskers their rights in the Ghetto, but only there. Purim thus  is now chiefly retained as a children's feast, and still better as a  feast of charity, of the interchange of gifts between friends, and the  bestowal of alms on the needy. This is a worthy survival.    Chanuka, on the other hand, grows every year into greater popularity. This  festival of light, when lamps are kindled in honour of the Maccabean  heroes, has of late been rediscovered by the liberals. For the first four  centuries of the Christian Era, the festival of Chanuka ('Dedication')  was observed by the Church as well as by the Synagogue. But for some  centuries afterwards the significance of the anniversary was obscured. It  is now realised as a momentous event in the world's history. It was not  merely a local triumph of Hebraism over Hellenism, but it represents  the re-entry of the East into the civilisation of the West. Alexander  the Great had occidentalised the Orient. But with the success of the  Judaeans against the Seleucids and of the Parthians against the Romans,  the East reasserted itself. And the newly recovered influence has never  again been surrendered. Hence this feast is a feast of ideals. Year by  year this is becoming more clearly seen. And the symbol of the feast,  light, is itself an inspiration.    The Jew is really a very sentimental being. He loves symbols. A  good deal of his fondness for ritual is due to this fact. The outward  marks of an inner state have always appealed to him. Ancient taboos  became not only consecrated but symbolical. Whether it be the rite of  circumcision, or the use of phylacteries and fringed praying garments,  or the adfixture of little scrolls in metal cases on the door-posts, or  the glad submission to the dietary laws, in all these matters sentiment  played a considerable part. And the word sentiment is used in its  best sense. Abstract morality is well enough for the philosopher,  but men of flesh and blood want their morality expressed in terms of  feeling. Love of God is a fine thing, but the Jew wished to do loving  acts of service. Obedience to the Will of God, the suppression of the  human desires before that Will, is a great ideal. But the Jew wished to  realise that he was obeying, that he was making the self-suppression. He  was not satisfied with a general law of holiness: he felt impelled to  holiness in detail, to a life in which the laws of bodily hygiene were  obeyed"]]]
