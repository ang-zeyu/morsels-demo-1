Hearing, O  bull of the Bharata race, of the merits of that Sabha, I became, O  king, desirous of beholding it. I then asked Aditya, saying,--\"O  exalted one, I desire to behold the sacred Sabha of the Grandsire. O  lord of light, tell me, O exalted one, by what ascetic penances, or by  what acts, or by what charms or by what rites, I may be enabled to  behold that excellent sin-cleaning Sabha.\"--Hearing these words of  mine, Aditya the god of day, the deity of a thousand rays, answered me,  \"O chief of the Bharata race, thus: Observe thou, with mind rapt in  meditation, the Brahma vow extending for a thousand years.\" Repairing  then to the breast of the Himavat, I commenced that great vow, and  after I had completed it the exalted and sinless deity Surya endued  with great energy, and knowing no fatigue, took me with him to the  Sabha of the Grandsire. O king, it is impossible to describe that  Sabha, saying--it is such, for within a moment it assumes a different  form that language fails to paint. O Bharata, it is impossible to  indicate its dimensions or shape. I never saw anything like it before.  Ever contributing to the happiness of those within it, its atmosphere  is neither cold nor warm. Hunger and thirst or any kind of uneasiness  disappear as soon as one goeth thither. It seems to be made up of  brilliant gems of many kinds. It doth not seem to be supported on  columns, it knoweth no deterioration, being eternal. That self  effulgent mansion, by its numerous blazing, celestial indications of  unrivalled splendour, seems to surpass the moon, the sun and the fire  in splendour. Stationed in heaven, it blazes forth, censuring as it  were the maker of the day. In that mansion O king, the Supreme Deity,  the Grand-sire of all created things, having himself created everything  by virtue of his creative illusion, stayeth ever. And Daksha,  Prachetas, Pulaha, Marichi, the master Kasyapa, Bhrigu, Atri, and  Vasistha and Gautama, and also Angiras, and Pulastya, Kraut, Prahlada,  and Kardama, these Prajapatis, and Angirasa of the Atharvan Veda, the  Valikhilyas, the Marichipas; Intelligence, Space, Knowledge, Air, Heat,  Water, Earth, Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, Scent; Nature, and the Modes  (of Nature), and the elemental and prime causes of the world,--all stay  in that mansion beside the lord Brahma. And Agastya of great energy,  and Markandeya, of great ascetic power, and Jamadagni and Bharadwaja,  and Samvarta, and Chyavana, and exalted Durvasa, and the virtuous  Rishyasringa, the illustrious Sanatkumara of great ascetic merit and  the preceptor in all matters affecting Yoga; Asita and Devala, and  Jaigishavya acquainted with truth; Rishava, Ajitasatru, and Mani of  great energy; and the Science of healing with its eight branches--all  in their personified forms, O Bharata; the moon with all the stars and  the stellar conjunctions; Aditya with all his rays; the winds; the  Sacrifices, the Declarations of purpose (in sacrifices), the Vital  principles,--these illustrious and vow-observing beings in their  personified forms, and many others too numerous to mention, attend all  upon Brahma in that mansion. Wealth and Religion and Desire, and Joy,  and Aversion, and Asceticism and Tranquillity--all wait together upon  the Supreme Deity in that palace. The twenty tribes of the Gandharvas  and Apsaras, as also their seven other tribes, and all the Lokapalas  (chief protectors of several regions), and Sukra, and Vrihaspati, and  Vudha, and Angaraka (Mangala), Sani, Rahu, and the other planets; the  Mantras (of the Sama Veda), the special Mantras (of the same Veda);  (the rites of) Harimat and Vasumat, the Adityas with Indra, the two  Agnis mentioned by name (viz. Agnisoma and Indragni), the Marutas,  Viswakarman, and the Vasus, O Bharata; the Pitris, and all kinds of  sacrificial libations, the four Vedas. viz., Rig, Sama, Yajuh, and  Atharva; all Sciences and branches of learning; Histories and all minor  branches of learning; the several branches of the Vedas; the planets,  the Sacrifices, the Soma, all the deities; Savitri (Gayatri), the seven  kinds of rhyme; Understanding, Patience, Memory, Wisdom, Intelligence,  Fame, Forgiveness; the Hymns of the Sama Veda; the Science of hymns in  general, and various kinds of Verses and Songs; various Commentaries  with arguments;--all in their personified forms, O king, and various  Dramas and Poems and Stories and abridged Glosses--these also, and many  others wait upon the Supreme Deity in that Sabha, Kshanas, Lavas,  Muhurtas, Day, Night, Fortnights, Months, the six Seasons, O Bharata,  Years, Yugas, the four kinds of Days and Nights (viz., appearing to  man, to the Pitris, to the gods, and to Brahma) and that eternal,  indestructible, undeteriorating, excellent Wheel of Time and also the  Wheel of Virtue,--these always wait there, O Yudhishthira; and Aditi,  Diti, Danu, Surasa, Vinata, Ira, Kalika, Suravi, Devi, Sarama, Gautami  and the goddesses Pradha, and Kadru;--these mothers of the celestials,  and Rudrani, Sree, Lakshmi, Bhadra, Shashthi, the Earth, Ganga, Hri,  Swaha, Kriti, the goddess Sura, Sachi Pushti, Arundhati, Samvritti,  Asa, Niyati, Srishti, Rati,--these and many other goddesses wait upon  the Creator of all. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Marutas, Aswinas, the  Viswadevas Sadhyas, and the Pitris gifted with the speed of the mind;  these all wait there upon the Grandsire. And, O bull amongst men, know  thou that there are seven classes of Pitris, of which four classes have  embodied forms and the remaining three without embodied forms. It is  well known that the illustrious Vairajas and Agniswattas and  Garhapattyas (three classes of Pitris) range in heaven. And those  amongst the Pitris that are called the Somapas, the Ekasringras, the  Chaturvedas, and the Kalas, are ever worshipped amongst the four orders  of men. Gratified with the Soma (juice), first, these gratify Soma  afterwards. All these tribes of Pitris wait upon the Lord of the  creation and cheerfully worship the Supreme Deity of immeasurable  energy. And Rakshasas, Pisachas, the Danavas and Guhyakas; Nagas,  Birds, and various animals; and all mobile and immobile great  beings;--all worship the Grandsire. And Purandara the chief of the  celestials, and Varuna and Kuvera and Yama, and Mahadeva accompanied by  Uma, always repair thither. And, O king of kings, Mahasena (Kartikeya)  also adoreth there the Grandsire. Narayana himself, and the celestial  Rishis, and those Rishis called Valakhillyas, and all beings born of  females and all those not born of females, and whatever else is seen in  the three worlds--both mobile and immobile, were all seen by me there,  know O king. And eighty thousand Rishis with vital seed drawn up, and O  Pandu, fifty thousand Rishis having sons, were all seen by me there.  And all the dwellers in heaven repairing thither behold the Supreme  Deity when they please, and worshipping him with a bow of their head  return whence they came. And, O king of men, the Grandsire of all  created beings, the Soul of the universe, the Self create Brahma of  immeasurable intelligence and glory, equally kind unto all creatures,  honoureth as they deserve, and gratifieth with sweet speech and gift of  wealth and other enjoyable articles, the gods, the Daityas, the Nagas,  the Brahmanas, the Yakshas, the Birds, the Kaleyas, the Gandharvas, the  Apsaras, and all other exalted beings that came to him as his guests.  And that delicious Sabha, O child, is always crowded with persons  coming and going. Filled with every kind of energy, and worshipped by  Brahmarshis, that celestial Sabha blazes forth with the graceful  possessions of Brahma and looks extremely handsome, O tiger among kings  as this Sabha of yours is unrivalled in the world of men, so is that  Sabha of Brahma, seen by me unrivalled in all the worlds. I have seen  these Sabhas, O Bharata, in regions of the celestials. This thy Sabha  is unquestionably the foremost in the world of men!'      SECTION XII    \"Yudhishthira said,--'O thou foremost of eloquent men, as thou hast  described the different Sabhas unto me, it appeareth that almost all  the monarchs of the earth are to be found in the Sabha of Yama. And, O  master, almost all the Nagas, and principal Daityas, and rivers, and  oceans, are to be found in the Sabha of Varuna. And so the Yakshas, the  Guhyakas, the Rakshasas, the Gandharvas and Apsaras and the Deity  (Yama) having the bull for his vehicle, are to be found in the Sabha of  the lord of treasures. Thou hast said that in the Sabha of the  Grandsire are to be seen all the great Rishis, all the gods, all the  branches of learning. As regards the Sabha of Sakra, however, thou hast  named, O Muni, all the gods, the Gandharvas, and various Rishis. But, O  great Muni, thou hast mentioned one and only one king, viz., the royal  Rishi Harishchandra as living in the Sabha of the illustrious chief of  the gods. What act was performed by that celebrated king, or what  ascetic penances with steady vows, in consequence of which he hath been  equal to Indra himself? O Brahmana, how didst thou also meet with my  father, the exalted Pandu, now a guest in the region of the Pitris? O  exalted one of excellent vows hath he told thee anything? O tell me all  as I am exceedingly curious to hear all this from thee.'    \"Narada said,--'O king of kings, I shall tell thee all that thou askest  me about Harischandra, I shall presently tell thee of his high  excellence. He was a powerful king, in fact, an emperor over all the  kings of the earth. Indeed, all the kings of the earth obeyed his sway.  O monarch, mounted alone upon a victorious car adorned with gold, that  king by the prowess of his weapons brought the whole earth with her  seven islands under his sway. And, O monarch, having subjugated the  whole earth with her mountains, forests, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7978"],[0,"Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of (#8)"],[1,"pposition, to the wishes of the Good  Mind, who was perpetually at work, in restoring the effects and  displacements, of the wicked devices of the other, at length led to a  personal combat, of which the time and instrument of battle were agreed  on. They fought two days; the Good Mind using the deer's horn, and the  other, using wild flag leafs, as arms. Got-ti-gah-rah-quast, or Good  Mind, who had chosen the horn, finally prevailed. His antagonist sunk  down into a region of darkness, and became the Evil Spirit of the world  of despair. Got-ti-gah-rah-quast, having obtained his triumph, retired  from the earth.    The earliest tradition that we have of the Iroquois is as follows: That a  company of Ongwahonwa being encamped on the banks of the St. Lawrence  River, where they were invaded by a nation--few in number, but were great  giants, called \"Ronongwaca.\" War after war was brought on by personal  encounters and incidents, and carried on with perfidity and cruelty. They  were delivered at length by the skill and courage of Yatontea, who, after  retreating before them, raised a large body of men and defeated them,  after which they were supposed to be extinct. And the next they suffered  was from the malice, perfidity and lust of an extraordinary appearing  person, who they called That-tea-ro-skeh, who was finally driven across  the St. Lawrence, and come to a town south of the shores of Lake Ontario,  where, however, he only disguised his intentions, to repeat his cruel and  perfidious deeds. He assassinated many persons, and violated six virgins.  They pointed to him as a fiend in human shape.    In this age of monsters, the country was again invaded by another  monster, which they called Oyahguaharh, supposed to be some great  mammoth, who was furious against men, and destroyed the lives of many  Indian hunters, but he was at length killed, after a long and severe  contest.    A great horned serpent also next appeared on Lake Ontario who, by means  of his poisonous breath, caused disease, and caused the death of many. At  length the old women congregated, with one accord, and prayed to the  Great Spirit that he would send their grand-father, the Thunder, who  would get to their relief in this, their sore time of trouble, and at the  same time burning tobacco as burned offerings. So finally the monster was  compelled to retire in the deeps of the lake by thunder bolts. Before  this calamity was forgotten another happened. A blazing star fell into  their fort, situated on the banks of the St. Lawrence, and destroyed the  people. Such a phenomenon caused a great panic and consternation and  dread, which they regarded as ominious of their entire destruction. Not  long after this prediction of the blazing star it was verified. These  tribes, who were held together by feeble ties, fell into dispute and wars  among themselves, which were pursued through a long period, until they  had utterly destroyed each other, and so reduced their numbers that the  lands were again over-run with wild beasts.    At this period there were six families took refuge in a large cave in a  mountain, where they dwelled for a long time. The men would come out  occasionally to hunt for food. This mammoth cave was situated at or near  the falls of the Oswego River. Taryenya-wa-gon (Holder of the Heavens)  extricated these six families from this subterraneous bowels and confines  of the mountain. They always looked to this divine messenger, who had  power to assume various shapes, as emergency dictated, as the friend and  patron of their nation.    As soon as they were released he gave them instructions respecting the  mode of hunting, matrimony, worship and many other things. He warned them  against the evil spirit, and gave them corn, beans, squash, potatoes,  tobacco, and dogs to hunt their game. He bid them go toward the rising of  the sun, and he personally guided them, until they came to a river, which  they named Yehnonanatche (that is going around a mountain,) now Mohawk,  they went down the bank of the river and came to where it discharges into  a great river, running towards the midway sun, they named it Skaw-nay-  taw-ty (that is beyond the pineries) now Hudson, and went down the banks  of the river and touched the bank of the great water. The company made an  encampment at this place and remained for a while. The people was then of  one language. Some of them went on the banks of the great waters, towards  the midway sun, and never returned. But the company that remained at the  camp returned as they came--along the bank of the river, under the  direction of Taryenyawagon (Holder of the Heavens).    This company were a particular body, which called themselves of one  household. Of these there were six families, and they entered into an  agreement to preserve the chain of alliance which should not be  extinguished under any circumstance.    The company advanced some distance up the river of Skawnatawty (Hudson).  The Holder of the Heavens directed the first family to make their  residence near the bank of the river, and the family was named Tehawrogeh  (that is, a speech divided) now Mohawk. Their language soon changed. The  company then turned and went towards the sun-setting, and traveled about  two days and a half, then came to a creek, which was named Kawnatawteruh  (that is pineries). The second family was directed to make their  residence near the creek; and the family was named Nehawretahgo (that is  big tree) now Oneida. Their language was changed likewise. The company  continued to proceed toward the sun-setting under the direction of the  Holder of the Heavens. The third family was directed to make their  residence on a mountain, named Onondaga (now Onondaga), and the family  was named Seuhnowhahtah (that is, carrying the name.) Their language also  changed. The rest of the company continued their journey towards the sun-  setting. The fourth family was directed to make their residence near a  large lake, named Goyogoh (that is a mountain rising from water) now  Cayuga, and the family was named Sho-nea-na-we-to-wah (that is a great  pipe). Their language was altered. The rest of the company kept their  course towards the sun-setting. The fifth family was directed to make  their residence near a high mountain, situated south of Canandaigua Lake,  which was named Tehow-nea-nyo-hent (that is possessing a door) now  Seneca. Their language was also changed. The sixth, and last family, went  on their journey toward the sun-setting, until they touched the bank of  the great lake, which was named Kan-ha-gwa-rah-ka (that is a Cape) now  Erie, and then went toward, between the midway and sun-setting, and  traveled a great distance, when they came to a large river, which was  named O-nah-we-yo-ka (that is a principal stream) now Mississippi. The  people discovered a grapevine lying across the river, by which a part of  the people went over, but while they were crossing the vine broke. They  were divided, and became enemies, to those that were over the river in  consequence of which, they were obliged to abandon the journey. Those  that went over the river were finally lost and forgotten from the memory  of those that remained on the eastern banks.    Ta-ren-ya-wa-go (the Holder of the Heavens), who was the patron of the  five home bands, did not fail, in this crisis, to direct them their way  also. He instructed those on the eastern bank the art of the bow and  arrows, to use for game and in time of danger. After giving them suitable  instructions, he guided their footsteps in their journeys, south and  east, until they had crossed the Alleghany Mountains, and with some  wanderings they finally reached the shores of the sea, on the coast which  is now called the Carolinas. By this time their language was changed.  They were directed to fix their residence on the banks of the Gow-ta-no  (that is, pine in the water) now Neuse River, in North Carolina. Here Ta-  ren-ya-wa-gon left them to hunt, increase and prosper, whilst he returned  to direct the other five nations to form their confederacy.    Tarenyawagon united in one person the power of a God and a man, and gave  him the expressive name of the Holder of the Heavens, and was capable of  assuming any form or shape that he chosed, but appeared to them only in  the form of a man, and taught them hunting, gardening, and the knowledge  of the arts of war. He imparted to them the knowledge of the laws and  government of the Great Spirit, and gave them directions and  encouragement how to fulfill their duties and obligations. He gave them  corn, beans, and fruits of various kinds, with the knowledge of planting  those fruits. He taught them how to kill and to cook the game. He made  the forest free to all the tribes to hunt, and removed obstructions from  the streams. He took his position, sometimes, on the top of high cliffs,  springing, if needs be, over frightful chasms; and he flew, as it were,  over great lakes in a wonderful canoe of immaculate whiteness and of  magic power.    Having finished his commission with the Tuscaroras at Cautanoh, in North  Carolina, and the other five families, which were left at the north, he  came down to closer terms and intimacy with the Onondagas. He resolved to  lay aside his divine character and live among them, that he might  exemplify the maxims which he had taught. And for this purpose he  selected a handsome spot of ground on the southern banks of Cross Lake,  New York. Here he built his cabin, and from the shores of this lake he  went into the forest, like the rest of his companions, in quest of game  and fish. He took a wife of the Onondagas, by whom he had an only  daughter, whom he tenderly loved, and most kindly and carefully treated  and instructed, so that she was known far and near as his favorite child,  and was regarded almost as a goddess. The excellence of his character,  and his great sagacity and good counsels, led the"]]]
