That was the captivation of it to me. If it had ever been meant to be  lived in, I might have thought it small, or inconvenient, or lonely; but  never having been designed for any such use, it became a perfect abode.    It was beautifully clean inside, and as tidy as possible. There was a  table, and a Dutch clock, and a chest of drawers, and on the chest of  drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a  parasol, taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a  hoop. The tray was kept from tumbling down, by a bible; and the tray, if  it had tumbled down, would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers  and a teapot that were grouped around the book. On the walls there were  some common coloured pictures, framed and glazed, of scripture subjects;  such as I have never seen since in the hands of pedlars, without seeing  the whole interior of Peggotty's brother's house again, at one view.  Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow  cast into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these. Over  the little mantelshelf, was a picture of the 'Sarah Jane' lugger, built  at Sunderland, with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it; a work of  art, combining composition with carpentry, which I considered to be one  of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford. There  were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling, the use of which I did not  divine then; and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort,  which served for seats and eked out the chairs.    All this I saw in the first glance after I crossed the  threshold--child-like, according to my theory--and then Peggotty opened  a little door and showed me my bedroom. It was the completest and most  desirable bedroom ever seen--in the stern of the vessel; with a little  window, where the rudder used to go through; a little looking-glass,  just the right height for me, nailed against the wall, and framed with  oyster-shells; a little bed, which there was just room enough to get  into; and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table. The walls  were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my  eyes quite ache with its brightness. One thing I particularly noticed  in this delightful house, was the smell of fish; which was so searching,  that when I took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose, I found it  smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster. On my imparting this  discovery in confidence to Peggotty, she informed me that her brother  dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish; and I afterwards found that a  heap of these creatures, in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one  another, and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of,  were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and  kettles were kept.    We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom I had seen  curtseying at the door when I was on Ham's back, about a quarter of a  mile off. Likewise by a most beautiful little girl (or I thought her so)  with a necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn't let me kiss her when I  offered to, but ran away and hid herself. By and by, when we had dined  in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs, melted butter, and potatoes, with  a chop for me, a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home. As  he called Peggotty 'Lass', and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek, I  had no doubt, from the general propriety of her conduct, that he was her  brother; and so he turned out--being presently introduced to me as Mr.  Peggotty, the master of the house.    'Glad to see you, sir,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'You'll find us rough, sir,  but you'll find us ready.'    I thanked him, and replied that I was sure I should be happy in such a  delightful place.    'How's your Ma, sir?' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Did you leave her pretty  jolly?'    I gave Mr. Peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as I could wish,  and that she desired her compliments--which was a polite fiction on my  part.    'I'm much obleeged to her, I'm sure,' said Mr. Peggotty. 'Well, sir,  if you can make out here, fur a fortnut, 'long wi' her,' nodding at his  sister, 'and Ham, and little Em'ly, we shall be proud of your company.'    Having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner, Mr.  Peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water, remarking  that 'cold would never get his muck off'. He soon returned, greatly  improved in appearance; but so rubicund, that I couldn't help  thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters, crabs, and  crawfish,--that it went into the hot water very black, and came out very  red.    After tea, when the door was shut and all was made snug (the nights  being cold and misty now), it seemed to me the most delicious retreat  that the imagination of man could conceive. To hear the wind getting  up out at sea, to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat  outside, and to look at the fire, and think that there was no house near  but this one, and this one a boat, was like enchantment. Little Em'ly  had overcome her shyness, and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and  least of the lockers, which was just large enough for us two, and just  fitted into the chimney corner. Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was  knitting on the opposite side of the fire. Peggotty at her needlework  was as much at home with St. Paul's and the bit of wax-candle, as if  they had never known any other roof. Ham, who had been giving me my  first lesson in all-fours, was trying to recollect a scheme of telling  fortunes with the dirty cards, and was printing off fishy impressions of  his thumb on all the cards he turned. Mr. Peggotty was smoking his pipe.  I felt it was a time for conversation and confidence.    'Mr. Peggotty!' says I.    'Sir,' says he.    'Did you give your son the name of Ham, because you lived in a sort of  ark?'    Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea, but answered:    'No, sir. I never giv him no name.'    'Who gave him that name, then?' said I, putting question number two of  the catechism to Mr. Peggotty.    'Why, sir, his father giv it him,' said Mr. Peggotty.    'I thought you were his father!'    'My brother Joe was his father,' said Mr. Peggotty.    'Dead, Mr. Peggotty?' I hinted, after a respectful pause.    'Drowndead,' said Mr. Peggotty.    I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty was not Ham's father, and  began to wonder whether I was mistaken about his relationship to anybody  else there. I was so curious to know, that I made up my mind to have it  out with Mr. Peggotty.    'Little Em'ly,' I said, glancing at her. 'She is your daughter, isn't  she, Mr. Peggotty?'    'No, sir. My brother-in-law, Tom, was her father.'    I couldn't help it. '--Dead, Mr. Peggotty?' I hinted, after another  respectful silence.    'Drowndead,' said Mr. Peggotty.    I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but had not got to the  bottom of it yet, and must get to the bottom somehow. So I said:    'Haven't you ANY children, Mr. Peggotty?'    'No, master,' he answered with a short laugh. 'I'm a bacheldore.'    'A bachelor!' I said, astonished. 'Why, who's that, Mr. Peggotty?'  pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting.    'That's Missis Gummidge,' said Mr. Peggotty.    'Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?'    But at this point Peggotty--I mean my own peculiar Peggotty--made such  impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions, that I could  only sit and look at all the silent company, until it was time to go to  bed. Then, in the privacy of my own little cabin, she informed me that  Ham and Em'ly were an orphan nephew and niece, whom my host had  at different times adopted in their childhood, when they were left  destitute: and that Mrs. Gummidge was the widow of his partner in  a boat, who had died very poor. He was but a poor man himself, said  Peggotty, but as good as gold and as true as steel--those were her  similes. The only subject, she informed me, on which he ever showed a  violent temper or swore an oath, was this generosity of his; and if it  were ever referred to, by any one of them, he struck the table a heavy  blow with his right hand (had split it on one such occasion), and swore  a dreadful oath that he would be 'Gormed' if he didn't cut and run  for good, if it was ever mentioned again. It appeared, in answer to  my inquiries, that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this  terrible verb passive to be gormed; but that they all regarded it as  constituting a most solemn imprecation.    I was very sensible of my entertainer's goodness, and listened to the  women's going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite  end of the boat, and to him and Ham hanging up two hammocks for  themselves on the hooks I had noticed in the roof, in a very luxurious  state of mind, enhanced by my being sleepy. As slumber gradually stole  upon me, I heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the  flat so fiercely, that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep  rising in the night. But I bethought myself that I was in a boat, after  all; and that a man like Mr. Peggotty was not a bad person to have on  board if anything did happen.    Nothing happened, however, worse than morning. Almost as soon as it  shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed, and out  with little Em'ly, picking up stones upon the beach.    'You're quite a sailor, I suppose?' I said to Em'ly. I don't know that I  supposed anything of the kind, but I felt it an act of gallantry to  say something; and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little  image of itself, at the moment, in her bright eye, that it came into my  head to say this.    'No,' replied Em'ly, shaking her head, 'I'm afraid of the sea.'    'Afraid!' I said, with a becoming air of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/770"],[0,"The Story of the Treasure Seekers (#8)"],[1,"Park as not. It's a lovely day.'    She always tells us to rinse out the cup at the drinking-fountain, and  the girls do; but I always put my head under the tap and drink. Then you  are an intrepid hunter at a mountain stream--and besides, you're sure  it's clean. Dicky does the same, and so does H. O. But Noel always  drinks out of the cup. He says it is a golden goblet wrought by  enchanted gnomes.    The day the Princess happened was a fine, hot day, last October, and we  were quite tired with the walk up to the Park.    We always go in by the little gate at the top of Croom's Hill. It is  the postern gate that things always happen at in stories. It was dusty  walking, but when we got in the Park it was ripping, so we rested a bit,  and lay on our backs, and looked up at the trees, and wished we could  play monkeys. I have done it before now, but the Park-keeper makes a row  if he catches you.    When we'd rested a little, Alice said--    'It was a long way to the enchanted wood, but it is very nice now we are  there. I wonder what we shall find in it?'    'We shall find deer,' said Dicky, 'if we go to look; but they go on the  other side of the Park because of the people with buns.'    Saying buns made us think of lunch, so we had it; and when we had done  we scratched a hole under a tree and buried the papers, because we know  it spoils pretty places to leave beastly, greasy papers lying about. I  remember Mother teaching me and Dora that, when we were quite little.  I wish everybody's parents would teach them this useful lesson, and the  same about orange peel.    When we'd eaten everything there was, Alice whispered--    'I see the white witch bear yonder among the trees! Let's track it and  slay it in its lair.'    'I am the bear,' said Noel; so he crept away, and we followed him among  the trees. Often the witch bear was out of sight, and then you didn't  know where it would jump out from; but sometimes we saw it, and just  followed.    'When we catch it there'll be a great fight,' said Oswald; 'and I shall  be Count Folko of Mont Faucon.'    'I'll be Gabrielle,' said Dora. She is the only one of us who likes  doing girl's parts.    'I'll be Sintram,' said Alice; 'and H. O. can be the Little Master.'    'What about Dicky?'    'Oh, I can be the Pilgrim with the bones.'    'Hist!' whispered Alice. 'See his white fairy fur gleaming amid yonder  covert!'    And I saw a bit of white too. It was Noel's collar, and it had come  undone at the back.    We hunted the bear in and out of the trees, and then we lost him  altogether; and suddenly we found the wall of the Park--in a place where  I'm sure there wasn't a wall before. Noel wasn't anywhere about, and  there was a door in the wall. And it was open; so we went through.    'The bear has hidden himself in these mountain fastnesses,' Oswald said.  'I will draw my good sword and after him.'    So I drew the umbrella, which Dora always will bring in case it rains,  because Noel gets a cold on the chest at the least thing--and we went  on.    The other side of the wall it was a stable yard, all cobble-stones.    There was nobody about--but we could hear a man rubbing down a horse  and hissing in the stable; so we crept very quietly past, and Alice  whispered--    ''Tis the lair of the Monster Serpent; I hear his deadly hiss! Beware!  Courage and despatch!'    We went over the stones on tiptoe, and we found another wall with  another door in it on the other side. We went through that too, on  tiptoe. It really was an adventure. And there we were in a shrubbery,  and we saw something white through the trees. Dora said it was the white  bear. That is so like Dora. She always begins to take part in a play  just when the rest of us are getting tired of it. I don't mean this  unkindly, because I am very fond of Dora. I cannot forget how kind she  was when I had bronchitis; and ingratitude is a dreadful vice. But it is  quite true.    'It is not a bear,' said Oswald; and we all went on, still on tiptoe,  round a twisty path and on to a lawn, and there was Noel. His collar had  come undone, as I said, and he had an inky mark on his face that he made  just before we left the house, and he wouldn't let Dora wash it off,  and one of his bootlaces was coming down. He was standing looking at a  little girl; she was the funniest little girl you ever saw.    She was like a china doll--the sixpenny kind; she had a white face, and  long yellow hair, done up very tight in two pigtails; her forehead was  very big and lumpy, and her cheeks came high up, like little shelves  under her eyes. Her eyes were small and blue. She had on a funny black  frock, with curly braid on it, and button boots that went almost up to  her knees. Her legs were very thin. She was sitting in a hammock chair  nursing a blue kitten--not a sky-blue one, of course, but the colour  of a new slate pencil. As we came up we heard her say to Noel--'Who are  you?'    Noel had forgotten about the bear, and he was taking his favourite part,  so he said--'I'm Prince Camaralzaman.'    The funny little girl looked pleased--    'I thought at first you were a common boy,' she said. Then she saw the  rest of us and said--    'Are you all Princesses and Princes too?'    Of course we said 'Yes,' and she said--    'I am a Princess also.' She said it very well too, exactly as if it were  true. We were very glad, because it is so seldom you meet any children  who can begin to play right off without having everything explained to  them. And even then they will say they are going to 'pretend to be' a  lion, or a witch, or a king. Now this little girl just said 'I _am_ a  Princess.' Then she looked at Oswald and said, 'I fancy I've seen you at  Baden.'    Of course Oswald said, 'Very likely.'    The little girl had a funny voice, and all her words were quite plain,  each word by itself; she didn't talk at all like we do.    H. O. asked her what the cat's name was, and she said 'Katinka.' Then  Dicky said--    'Let's get away from the windows; if you play near windows some one  inside generally knocks at them and says \"Don't\".'    The Princess put down the cat very carefully and said--    'I am forbidden to walk off the grass.'    'That's a pity,' said Dora.    'But I will if you like,' said the Princess.    'You mustn't do things you are forbidden to do,' Dora said; but Dicky  showed us that there was some more grass beyond the shrubs with only a  gravel path between. So I lifted the Princess over the gravel, so that  she should be able to say she hadn't walked off the grass. When we got  to the other grass we all sat down, and the Princess asked us if  we liked 'dragees' (I know that's how you spell it, for I asked  Albert-next-door's uncle).    We said we thought not, but she pulled a real silver box out of her  pocket and showed us; they were just flat, round chocolates. We had two  each. Then we asked her her name, and she began, and when she began she  went on, and on, and on, till I thought she was never going to stop. H.  O. said she had fifty names, but Dicky is very good at figures, and he  says there were only eighteen. The first were Pauline, Alexandra, Alice,  and Mary was one, and Victoria, for we all heard that, and it ended  up with Hildegarde Cunigonde something or other, Princess of something  else.    When she'd done, H. O. said, 'That's jolly good! Say it again!' and she  did, but even then we couldn't remember it. We told her our names, but  she thought they were too short, so when it was Noel's turn he said he  was Prince Noel Camaralzaman Ivan Constantine Charlemagne James John  Edward Biggs Maximilian Bastable Prince of Lewisham, but when she asked  him to say it again of course he could only get the first two names  right, because he'd made it up as he went on.    So the Princess said, 'You are quite old enough to know your own name.'  She was very grave and serious.    She told us that she was the fifth cousin of Queen Victoria. We asked  who the other cousins were, but she did not seem to understand. She went  on and said she was seven times removed. She couldn't tell us what that  meant either, but Oswald thinks it means that the Queen's cousins are  so fond of her that they will keep coming bothering, so the Queen's  servants have orders to remove them. This little girl must have been  very fond of the Queen to try so often to see her, and to have been  seven times removed. We could see that it is considered something to  be proud of; but we thought it was hard on the Queen that her cousins  wouldn't let her alone.    Presently the little girl asked us where our maids and governesses were.    We told her we hadn't any just now. And she said--    'How pleasant! And did you come here alone?'    'Yes,' said Dora; 'we came across the Heath.'    'You are very fortunate,' said the little girl. She sat very upright on  the grass, with her fat little hands in her lap. 'I should like to go on  the Heath. There are donkeys there, with white saddle covers. I should  like to ride them, but my governess will not permit.'    'I'm glad we haven't a governess,' H. O. said. 'We ride the donkeys  whenever we have any pennies, and once I gave the man another penny to  make it gallop.'    'You are indeed fortunate!' said the Princess again, and when she looked  sad the shelves on her cheeks showed more than ever. You could have laid  a sixpence on them quite safely if you had had one.    'Never mind,' said Noel; 'I've got a lot of money. Come out and have a  ride now.' But the little girl shook her head and said she was afraid it  would not be correct.    Dora said she was quite right; then all of a sudden came one of those  uncomfortable times when nobody can think of anything to say, so we sat  and looked at each other. But at last Alice said we ought to be going.    'Do not go yet,' the little girl said. 'At what time did they order your  carriage?'    'Our carriage is a fairy one, drawn by griffins, and it comes"]]]
