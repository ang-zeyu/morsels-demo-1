[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#9)"],[1," the celebrated Havre engineer, a torpedo boat called the Poti,  which we herewith illustrate. This vessel perceptibly differs from all  others of her class, at least as regards her model. Her extremities,  which are strongly depressed in the upperworks, and the excessive  inclination of her sides, give the boat as a whole a certain resemblance  to the rams of our navy, such as the Taureau and Tigre.    [Illustration: THE NEW RUSSIAN TORPEDO BOAT, THE \"POTI\".]    A transverse section of the Poti approaches an ellipse in shape. Her  water lines are exceedingly fine, and, in point of elegance, in no wise  cede to those of the most renowned yachts. The vessel is entirely of  steel, and her dimensions are as follows: Length, 28 meters; extreme  breadth, 3.6 meters; depth, 2.5 meters; draught, 1.9 meters;  displacement, 66 tons. The engine, which is a compound one, is of 600  H.P. The minimum speed required is 18 knots, or 33-34 meters, per hour,  and it will probably reach 40 kilometers.    The vessel will be armed with 4 Whitehead torpedoes of 5.8 m., and 2  Hotchkiss guns of 40 cm. Her supply of coal will be sufficient for a  voyage of 1000 nautical miles at a speed of 11 knots.--_L'Illustration_.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW STEAMER PROPELLED BY HYDRAULIC REACTION.      The oar, the helix, and the paddle-wheel constitute at present the means  of propulsion that are exclusively employed when one has recourse to a  motive power for effecting the propulsion of a boat. The sail  constitutes an entirely different mode, and should not figure in our  enumeration, considering the essentially variable character of the force  utilized.    In all these propellers, we have only an imitation, very often a rude  one, of the processes which nature puts in play in fishes and mollusks,  and the mode that we now wish to make known is without contradiction  that which imitates these the best.    Hydraulic propulsion by reaction consists, in principle, in effecting a  movement of boats, by sucking in water at the bow and forcing it out at  the stern. This is a very old idea. Naturalists cite whole families of  mollusks that move about in this way with great rapidity. It is probable  that such was the origin of the first idea of this mode of operating.  However this may be, as long ago as 1661 a patent was taken out in  England, on this principle, by Toogood & Hayes. After this we find the  patents of Allen (1729) and Rumsay (1788). In France, Daniel Bernouilli  presented to the Academic des Sciences a similar project during the last  century.    Mr. Seydell was the first to build a vessel on this principle. This  ship, which was called the Enterprise, was of 100 tons burden, and was  constructed at Edinburgh for marine fishery. The success of this was  incomplete, but it was sufficient to show all the advantage that could  be got from the idea. Another boat, the Albert, was built at Stettin,  after the same type and at about the same epoch; and the question was  considered of placing a reaction propeller upon the Great Eastern.    About 1860 the question was taken up again by the house of Cokerill de  Seraing, which built the Seraing No. 2, that did service as an excursion  boat between Liege and Seraing. The propeller of this consisted of a  strong centrifugal pump, with vertical axis, actuated by a low pressure  engine. This pump sucked water into a perforated channel at the bottom  of the boat, and forced it through a spiral pipe to the propelling  tubes. These latter consisted of two elbowed pipes issuing from the  sides of the vessel and capable of pivoting in the exhaust ports in such  a way as to each turn its mouth downward at will, backward or forward.  The water expelled by the elbowed pipes reacted through pressure, as in  the hydraulic tourniquet of cabinets of physics, and effected the  propulsion of the vessel. Upon turning the two mouths of the propelling  tubes backward, the boat was thrust forward, and, when they were turned  toward the front, she was thrust backward. When one was turned toward  the front and the other toward the stern, the boat swung around.  Finally, when the two mouths were placed vertically the boat remained  immovable. All the evolutions were easy, even without the help of the  rudder, and the ways in which the propelling tubes could be placed were  capable of being varied _ad infinitum_ by a system of levers.    The Seraing No. 2 had an engine of a nominal power of 40 horses, and  took on an average 30 minutes to make the trip, backward and forward, of  85 kilometers, with four stoppages.    The success obtained was perfect, and the running was most satisfactory.  It was remarked, only, that from the standpoint of effective duty it  would have been desirable to reduce the velocity of the water at its  exit from the propellers.    Mr. Poillon attributes the small effective performance to the system  employed for putting the water in motion. At time of Mr. Seraing's  experiments, only centrifugal force pumps were known, and the theoretic  effective duty of these, whatever be the peculiar system of  construction, cannot exceed 66 per cent., and, in practice, falls to 40  or 50 per cent. in the majority of cases.    It is probable, then, that in making use of those new rotary pumps where  effective duty reaches and often exceeds 80 per cent., we might obtain  much better results, and it is this that justifies the new researches  that have been undertaken by Messrs. Maginot & Pinette, whose first  experiments we are about to make known.    In order to have it understood what interest attaches to these  researches, let us state the principal advantages that this mode of  propulsion will have over the helix and paddle wheel: The width of  side-wheel boats will be reduced by from 20 to 30 per cent., and the  draught of water will be diminished in screw steamers to that of the  hull itself; the maneuver in which the power of the engine might be  directly employed will be simplified; a machine will be had of a  sensibly constant speed, and without change in its running; the  production of waves capable of injuring the banks of canals will be  avoided; the propeller will be capable of being utilized as a bilge  pump; all vibration will be suppressed; the boat will be able to run at  any speed under good conditions, while the helix works well only when  the speed of the vessel corresponds to its pitch; it will be possible to  put the propelling apparatus under water; and, finally, it will be  possible to run the pump directly by the shaft of the high speed engine,  without intermediate gearing, which is something that would prove a very  great advantage in the case of electric pleasure boats actuated by piles  and accumulators and dynamo-electric machines.    [Illustration: NEW STEAMER PROPELLED BY HYDRAULIC REACTION.]    We now arrive at Messrs. Maginot & Pinette's system, the description of  which will be greatly facilitated by the diagram that accompanies this  article. The inventors have employed a boat 14 meters in length by 1.8  m. in width, and 65 centimeters draught behind and 32 in front. The  section of the midship beam is 70 square decimeters, and that of the  exhaust port is 4. At a speed of 2.2 meters per second the tractive  stress, K, is from 10 to 11 kilogrammes. At a speed of 13.5 kilometers  per hour, or 3.75 meters per second, the engine develops a power of 12  horses. The piston is 19 centimeters in diameter, and has a stroke of 15  centimeters. The shaft, in common, of the pump and engine makes 410  revolutions per minute. It will be seen from the figure that suction  occurs at the lower part of the hull, at A, and that the water is forced  out at B, to impel the vessel forward. C and C' are the tubes for  putting the vessel about, and DD' the tubes for causing her to run  backward. Owing to the tubes, C, C', the rudder has but small dimensions  and is only used for _directing_ the boat. The vessel may be turned  about _in situ_ by opening one of the receiving tubes, according to the  side toward which it is desired to turn.    This boat is as yet only in an experimental state, and the first trials  of her that have recently been made upon the Saone have shown the  necessity of certain modifications that the inventors are now at work  upon.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW FORM OF FLEXIBLE BAND DYNAMOMETER.    [Footnote: Read before Section G of British Association.]    By Professor W.C. UNWIN.      [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    In the ordinary strap dynamometer a flexible band, sometimes carrying  segments of wood blocks, is hung over a pulley rotated by the motor, the  power of which is to be measured. If the pulley turns with left-handed  rotation, the friction would carry the strap toward the left, unless the  weight, Q, were greater than P. If the belt does not slip in either  direction when the pulley rotates under it, then Q-P exactly measures  the friction on the surface of the pulley; and V being the surface  velocity of the pulley (Q-P)V, is exactly the work consumed by the  dynamometer. But the work consumed in friction can be expressed in  another way. Putting [theta] for the arc embraced by the belt, and [mu]  for the coefficient of friction,      Q/P = [epsilon]^{[mu]^{[theta]}},    or for a given arc of contact Q = [kappa]P, where [kappa] depends only  on the coefficient of friction, increasing as [mu] increases, and _vice  versa_. Hence, for the belt to remain at rest with two fixed weights, Q  and P, it is necessary that the coefficient of friction should be  exactly constant. But this constancy cannot be obtained. The coefficient  of friction varies with the condition of lubrication of the surface of  the pulley, which alters during the running and with every change in the  velocity and temperature of the rubbing surfaces. Consequently, in a  dynamometer in this simple form more or less violent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#9)"],[1,"to obtain a peaceful solution of the Morocco question.]    Those who favour this view take up approximately the same attitude as  the supporters of the Peace idea, so far as regarding war exclusively as  a curse, and ignoring or underestimating its creative and civilizing  importance. According to this view, a war recognized as inevitable must  be postponed so long as possible, and no statesman is entitled to use  exceptionally favourable conditions in order to realize necessary and  justifiable aspirations by force of arms.    Such theories only too easily disseminate the false and ruinous notion  that the maintenance of peace is the ultimate object, or at least the  chief duty, of any policy.    To such views, the offspring of a false humanity, the clear and definite  answer must be made that, under certain circumstances, it is not only  the right, but the moral and political duty of the statesman to bring  about a war.    Wherever we open the pages of history we find proofs of the fact that  wars, begun at the right moment with manly resolution, have effected the  happiest results, both politically and socially. A feeble policy has  always worked harm, since the statesman lacked the requisite firmness to  take the risk of a necessary war, since he tried by diplomatic tact to  adjust the differences of irreconcilable foes, and deceived himself as  to the gravity of the situation and the real importance of the matter.  Our own recent history in its vicissitudes supplies us with the most  striking examples of this.    The Great Elector laid the foundations of Prussia's power by successful  and deliberately incurred wars. Frederick the Great followed in the  steps of his glorious ancestor. \"He noticed how his state occupied an  untenable middle position between the petty states and the great Powers,  and showed his determination to give a definite character (_decider cet  etre_) to this anomalous existence; it had become essential to enlarge  the territory of the State and _corriger la figure de la Prusse_, if  Prussia wished to be independent and to bear with honour the great name  of 'Kingdom.'\" [D] The King made allowance for this political necessity,  and took the bold determination of challenging Austria to fight. None of  the wars which he fought had been forced upon him; none of them did he  postpone as long as possible. He had always determined to be the  aggressor, to anticipate his opponents, and to secure for himself  favourable prospects of success. We all know what he achieved. The whole  history of the growth of the European nations and of mankind generally  would have been changed had the King lacked that heroic power of  decision which he showed.    [Footnote D Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte,\" i., p. 51.]    We see a quite different development under the reign of Frederick  William III., beginning with the year of weakness 1805, of which our  nation cannot be too often reminded.    It was manifest that war with Napoleon could not permanently be avoided.  Nevertheless, in spite of the French breach of neutrality, the Prussian  Government could not make up its mind to hurry to the help of the allied  Russians and Austrians, but tried to maintain peace, though at a great  moral cost. According to all human calculation, the participation of  Prussia in the war of 1805 would have given the Allies a decisive  superiority. The adherence to neutrality led to the crash of 1806, and  would have meant the final overthrow of Prussia as a State had not the  moral qualities still existed there which Frederick the Great had  ingrained on her by his wars. At the darkest moment of defeat they shone  most brightly. In spite of the political downfall, the effects of  Frederick's victories kept that spirit alive with which he had inspired  his State and his people. This is clearly seen in the quite different  attitude of the Prussian people and the other Germans under the  degrading yoke of the Napoleonic tyranny. The power which had been  acquired by the Prussians through long and glorious wars showed itself  more valuable than all the material blessings which peace created; it  was not to be broken down by the defeat of 1806, and rendered possible  the heroic revival of 1813.    The German wars of Unification also belong to the category of wars  which, in spite of a thousand sacrifices, bring forth a rich harvest.  The instability and political weakness which the Prussian Government  showed in 1848, culminating in the disgrace of Olmuetz in 1850, had  deeply shaken the political and national importance of Prussia. On the  other hand, the calm conscious strength with which she faced once more  her duties as a nation, when King William I. and Bismarck were at the  helm, was soon abundantly manifest. Bismarck, by bringing about our  wars of Unification in order to improve radically an untenable position  and secure to our people healthy conditions of life, fulfilled the  long-felt wish of the German people, and raised Germany to the  undisputed rank of a first-class European Power. The military successes  and the political position won by the sword laid the foundation for an  unparalleled material prosperity. It is difficult to imagine how  pitiable the progress of the German people would have been had not these  wars been brought about by a deliberate policy.    The most recent history tells the same story. If we judge the Japanese  standpoint with an unbiased mind we shall find the resolution to fight  Russia was not only heroic, but politically wise and morally  justifiable. It was immensely daring to challenge the Russian giant, but  the purely military conditions were favourable, and the Japanese nation,  which had rapidly risen to a high stage of civilization, needed an  extended sphere of influence to complete her development, and to open  new channels for her superabundant activities. Japan, from her own point  of view, was entitled to claim to be the predominant civilized power in  Eastern Asia, and to repudiate the rivalry of Russia. The Japanese  statesmen were justified by the result. The victorious campaign created  wider conditions of life for the Japanese people and State, and at one  blow raised it to be a determining co-factor in international politics,  and gave it a political importance which must undeniably lead to great  material advancement. If this war had been avoided from weakness or  philanthropic illusions, it is reasonable to assume that matters would  have taken a very different turn. The growing power of Russia in the  Amur district and in Korea would have repelled or at least hindered the  Japanese rival from rising to such a height of power as was attained  through this war, glorious alike for military prowess and political  foresight.    The appropriate and conscious employment of war as a political means has  always led to happy results. Even an unsuccessfully waged war may  sometimes be more beneficial to a people than the surrender of vital  interests without a blow. We find an example of this in the recent  heroic struggle of the small Boer States against the British Empire. In  this struggle they were inevitably defeated. It was easy to foresee that  an armed peasantry could not permanently resist the combined forces of  England and her colonies, and that the peasant armies generally could  not bear heavy losses. But yet--if all indications are not  misleading--the blood shed by the Boer people will yield a free and  prosperous future. In spite of much weakness, the resistance was heroic;  men like President Stein, Botha, and De Wett, with their gallant  followers, performed many great military feats. The whole nation  combined and rose unanimously to fight for the freedom of which Byron  sings:      \"For freedom's battle once begun,    Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,    Though baffled oft, is ever won.\"    Inestimable moral gains, which can never be lost in any later  developments, have been won by this struggle. The Boers have maintained  their place as a nation; in a certain sense they have shown themselves  superior to the English. It was only after many glorious victories that  they yielded to a crushingly superior force. They accumulated a store of  fame and national consciousness which makes them, though conquered, a  power to be reckoned with. The result of this development is that the  Boers are now the foremost people in South Africa, and that England  preferred to grant them self-government than to be faced by their  continual hostility. This laid the foundation for the United Free States  of South Africa.[E]    [Footnote E: \"War and the Arme Blanche,\" by Erskine Childers: \"The truth  came like a flash ... that all along we had been conquering the  country, not the race; winning positions, not battles\" (p. 215).    \"To ... aim at so cowing the Boer national spirit, as to gain a  permanent political ascendancy for ourselves, was an object beyond  our power to achieve. Peaceable political fusion under our own flag  was the utmost we could secure. That means a conditional surrender,  or a promise of future autonomy\" (pp. 227-228). Lord Roberts wrote  a very appreciative introduction to this book without any protest  against the opinions expressed in it.]    President Kruger, who decided on this most justifiable war, and not  Cecil Rhodes, will, in spite of the tragic ending to the war itself, be  known in all ages as the great far-sighted statesman of South Africa,  who, despite the unfavourable material conditions, knew how to value the  inestimable moral qualities according to their real importance.    The lessons of history thus confirm the view that wars which have been  deliberately provoked by far-seeing statesmen have had the happiest  results. War, nevertheless, must always be a violent form of political  agent, which not only contains in itself the danger of defeat, but in  every case calls for great sacrifices, and entails incalculable misery."]]]
