Dr. RUTHERFORD: I quoted Mr. Bright as making the very proposal I have  made, with the exception of the Duma--namely, Provincial Parliaments.    Mr. MORLEY: I am afraid I must traverse my hon. friend's description  of Mr. Bright's view, with which, I think, I am pretty well  acquainted. Mr. Bright was, I believe, on the right track at the time,  when in 1858 the Government of India was transferred to the Crown.  He was not in favour of universal suffrage--he was rather  old-fashioned--but Mr. Bright's proposal was perfectly different from  that of my hon. friend. Sir Henry Maine, and others who had been  concerned with Indian affairs, came to the conclusion that Mr.  Bright's idea was right--that to put one man, a Viceroy, assisted as  he might be with an effective Executive Council, in charge of such  an area as India and its 300 millions of population, with all its  different races, creeds, modes of thought, was to put on a Viceroy's  shoulder a load that no man of whatever powers, however gigantic they  might be, could be expected effectively to support. My hon. friend and  others who sometimes favour me with criticisms in the same sense,  seem to suggest that I am a false brother, that I do not know what  Liberalism is. I think I do, and I must even say that I do not think I  have anything to learn of the principles or maxims or the practice of  Liberal doctrines even from my hon. friend. You are bound to look at  the whole mass of the difficulties and perplexing problems connected  with India, from a common-sense plane, and it is not common sense, if  I may say so without discourtesy, to talk of Imperial Dumas. I have  not had a word of thanks from that quarter, in the midst of a shower  of reproach, for what I regard, in all its direct and indirect results  and bearings, as one of the most important moves that have been made  in connection with the relations between Great Britain and India for  a long time--I mean, the admission of two Indian gentlemen to the  Council of the Secretary of State. An hon. friend wants me to appoint  an Indian gentleman to the Viceroy's Executive Council. Well, that  is a different thing; but I am perfectly sure that, if an occasion  offers, neither Lord Minto nor I would fall short of some such  application of democratic principles. In itself it is something that  we have a Viceroy and a Secretary of State thoroughly alive to the  great change in temperature and atmosphere that has been going on in  India for the last five or six years, and I do not think we ought to  be too impatiently judged. We came in at a perturbed time; we did not  find balmy breezes and smooth waters. It is notorious that we came  into enormous difficulties, which we had not created. How they were  created is a long story that has nothing whatever to do with the  present discussion. But what I submit with the utmost confidence  is that the situation to-day is a considerable improvement on the  situation that we found, when we assumed power two years ago. There  have been heavy and black clouds over the Indian horizon during  those two years. By our policy those clouds have been to some extent  dispersed. I am not so unwise as to say that the clouds will never  come back again; but what has been done by us has been justified, in  my opinion, by the event.    Some fault was found, and I do not in the least complain, with the  deportation of two native gentlemen. I do not quarrel with the man  who finds fault with that proceeding. To take anybody and deport him  without bringing any charge against him, and with no intention of  bringing him to trial, is a step that, I think, the House is perfectly  justified in calling me to account for. I have done my best to account  for it, and to-day, anyone who knows the Punjab, would agree that,  whatever may happen at some remote period, its state is comparatively  quiet and satisfactory. I am not going to repeat my justification of  that strong measure of deportation, but I should like to read to the  House the words of the Viceroy in the Legislative Council in November  last, when he was talking about the circumstances with which we had to  deal. He said, addressing Lord Kitchener--       \"I hope that your Excellency will on my behalf as Viceroy and as      representing the King convey to His Majesty's Indian troops      my thanks for the contempt with which they have received the      disgraceful overtures which I know have been made to them. The      seeds of sedition have been unscrupulously scattered throughout      India, even amongst the hills of the frontier tribes. We are      grateful that they have fallen on much barren ground, but we can      no longer allow their dissemination.\"    Will anybody say, that in view of the possible danger pointed to in  that language of the Viceroy two or three months ago, we did wrong in  using the regulation which applied to the case? No one can say what  mischief might have followed, if we had taken any other course than  that which we actually took.    Let me beseech my hon. friends at least to try for some sense of  balanced proportion, instead of allowing their wrath at one particular  incident of policy to blot out from their vision all the wide and  durable operations, to which we have set firm and persistent hands.  After all, this absence of a sense of proportion is what, more than  any other one thing, makes a man a wretched politician.    Now as to the reforms that are mentioned in my hon. friend's  Amendment. It is an extraordinary Amendment. It--        \"submits that the present condition of affairs in India demands      the immediate and serious attention of His Majesty's Government.\"    I could cordially vote for that, only remarking that the hon. member  must think the Secretary of State, and the Viceroy, and other persons  immediately concerned in the Government of India, very curious people  if he supposes that the state of affairs in India does not always  demand their immediate and very serious attention. Then the Amendment  says--        \"The present proposals of the Government of India are inadequate      to allay the existing and growing discontent.\"    I hope it is not presumptuous to say so, but I should have expected a  definition from my hon. friend of what he guesses these proposals are.  I should like to set a little examination paper to my hon. friend. I  have studied them for many months, yet would rather not be examined  for chapter and verse. But my hon. friend after his famous six weeks  of travel knows all about them, and the state of affairs for which our  plans are the inadequate remedy. I do not want to hold him up as a  formidable example: but in his speech to-day he went over--and it  does credit to his industry--every single one of the most burning and  controversial questions of the whole system of Indian Government and  seemed to say, \"I will tell you how far this is wrong and exactly what  ought to be done to put what is wrong right.\" I think I have got from  him twenty _ipse dixits_ on all these topics on which we slow dull  people at the India Office are wearing ourselves to pieces. When it is  said, as I often hear it said, that I, for example, am falling  into the hands of my officials, it should be remembered that those  gentlemen who go to India also get into the hands of other people.    Dr. RUTHERFORD: I was in the hands both of officials and of Indians.    Mr. MORLEY: Then let me assure him, perhaps to his amazement, that he  came out of the hands of both of them still with something to learn.  I wonder whether, when this House is asked to condemn the present  proposals of the Government of India as being inadequate to allay the  existing and growing discontent, it is realised exactly how the case  stands. I will repeat what I said in the debate on the Indian  Budget. The Government of India sent over to the India Office their  proposals--their various schemes for advisory councils and so forth.  We at the India Office subjected them to a careful scrutiny and  laborious examination. As a result of this careful scrutiny and  examination, they were sent back to the Government of India with the  request that they would submit them to discussion in various quarters.  The instruction to the Government of India was that by the end of  March, the India Office was to learn what the general view was at  which the Government of India had themselves arrived upon the plans,  with all their complexities and variations. We wanted to know what  they would tell us. It will be for us to consider how far the report  so arrived at, how far these proposals, ripened by Indian opinion,  carried out the policy which His Majesty's Government had in view.  Surely that is a reasonable and simple way of proceeding? When you  have to deal with complex communities of varied races, and all the  other peculiarities of India, you have to think out how your proposals  will work. Democracies do not always think how things will work.  Sir Henry Cotton made a speech that interested and struck me by its  moderation and reasonableness. He made a number of remarks in perfect  good faith about officials, which I received in a chastened spirit,  for he has been for a very long time a very distinguished official  himself. Therefore, he knows all about it. He went on to talk of  the great problem of the separation of the executive and judicial  functions, which is one of the living problems of India. I can only  assure my hon. friend that that is engaging our attention both in  India and here.    Another of the subjects to which the attention of the Indian  Government has been specifically directed has regard to the mitigation  of flogging, the restriction of civil flogging, and the limitation of  military flogging to specific cases. In this we are making a marked  advance in humanity and common sense,--which is itself a kind of  humanity.    My hon. friend appeals to me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10985"],[0,"The Infant System (#9)"],[1,"rnell, who was present during the search, averred that the  prisoner had most positively declared that he had not a pawnbroker's  duplicate in his possession.    \"Mr. Watt, a linen-draper, of Harper Street, Kent Road, stated that  he attended in consequence of seeing the police reports in the  newspapers, describing the two children; he immediately recognised the  two little girls as having frequently called at his shop for trifling  articles; and added, that he had been robbed of a variety of silk  handkerchiefs and shawls, and he had no doubt but that the prisoners  were the thieves. It was their practice, he said, to go into a shop,  and call for a quarter of a yard of muslin, and while the shopkeeper  was engaged, the eldest would very dexterously slip whatever article  was nearest, to her little sister, who was trained to the business,  and would thrust the stolen property into a basket which she always  carried for that purpose. Mr. Watt identified the silk handkerchiefs  as his property, and said that they had been stolen in the above  manner by the prisoners.    \"The father was asked where he had got the handkerchiefs? He replied,  that he had bought them from a pedlar for half-a-crown a piece at his  door. However, his eldest daughter contradicted him by acknowledging  that her sister had stolen them from the shop of Mr. Watt. He became  dreadfully agitated, and then said--'What could I say? Surely I was  not to criminate my own children!'    \"Mr. Allen observed, that there was a clear case against the two  children, but after consulting with the other magistrates, he was of  opinion that the youngest child should be given up into the charge of  the parish officers of Newington, as she was too young to go into a  prison, and desired that the other girl should be remanded, in order  to have some of the pledged goods produced. The father was committed  in default of bail for receiving stolen goods. The child has since  been found guilty. The prosecutor stated that the family consisted of  five children, _not one of whom could read or write_!\"    Another very cruel practice of these young delinquents is, to go  into some chandlers shop as slily as possible, and take the first  opportunity of stealing the till with its contents, there being always  some older thief ready to take charge of it, as soon as the child  removes it from the shop.[A] Many a poor woman has had to lament  the loss of her till, with its contents, taken by a child, perhaps,  scarcely six years of age. There is always a plan laid down for the  child to act upon. Should he be unable to obtain possession of the  till himself, he is instructed to pretend that he has missed his way,  and to inquire for some street near the spot; or, he will address  her with, \"Please, ma'am, can you tell me what it is o'clock?\" The  unsuspecting woman, with the greatest kindness possible, shews the  child the street he inquires for, or leaves the shop to ascertain the  hour, and for her civility, she is sure to find herself robbed, when  she returns, by some of the child's companions. Should he be detected  in actual possession of the property, he is instructed to act his part  in the most artful manner, by pretending that some man sent him into  the shop to take it, who told him that he would give him sixpence to  buy cakes.    [Footnote A: So complete is the science of pilfering rendered by its  perpetrators, that they have even a peculiar vocabulary of their own,  rendering their conversation, to those who may chance to overhear  them, as mysterious and incomprehensible as though they were  conversing in a foreign tongue; for instance, the scutcheons they  steal from the key holes are called _porcupines_; brass weights,  _lueys_; while purloining the contents of a till, is called _taking  the ding_. In short, they have a peculiar name for almost every  thing.]    It is not uncommon for these young offenders to stop children, whom  they may meet in the street unprotected, and either by artifice or  violence, take from them their hats, necklaces, &c., thus initiating  themselves, as it were, into the desperate crime of assault and  highway robbery.    Young as the subjects of the foregoing narrations mostly were, I have  little doubt their pupilage commenced at a much earlier age; they  could not otherwise have attained so much proficiency in the practice  of crime, and hardihood on detection. However possible it maybe  thought to reclaim children of so tender an age, I am convinced that  thieves of more advanced years become so thoroughly perverted in  their wills and understandings, as to be incapable of perceiving the  disgrace of their conduct, or the enormity of the offence. I was once  told by an old thief that thieving was his profession, and he had  therefore a right to follow it; and I could plainly discover from  further conversation with him, that he had established in himself an  opinion that thieving was no harm, provided he used no violence to  the person; he seemed, indeed, to have no other idea of the rights of  property, than that described as the maxim of a celebrated Scottish  outlaw,--that      \"They should take who have the power,    And they should keep who can.\"    When this most lamentable state is reached, it is to be feared all  modes of punishment, as correctives, are useless; and the only thing  left is to prevent further depredation by banishment.    The incorrigibility which a child may attain, who has once associated  with thieves at an early age, is apparent from the following fact.  \"Richard Leworthy, aged fourteen, was indicted for stealing five  sovereigns, the property of William Newling, his master. The  prosecutor stated, that he resided in the Commercial Road, and is  by business a tailor; the prisoner had been his apprentice for four  months, up to the 28th of August, when he committed the robbery. On  that day he gave him five pounds to take to Mr. Wells, of Bishopsgate  Street, to discharge a bill; he never went, nor did he return home; he  did not hear of him for three weeks, when he found him at Windsor, and  apprehended him. The prisoner admitted having applied the money to his  own use. He was found at a public house, and said he had spent all his  money except one shilling and six pence. A shopman in the service of  Mr. Wells, stated that in August last the witness owed his master a  sum of money; he knew the prisoner; he did not bring money to their  shop, either on or since the 28th of August. The prisoner made no  defence, but called his master, who said he received him from the  Refuge for the Destitute, and had a good character with him. He would  not take him back again. Mr. Wontner stated, that he had received  two communications from the Rev. Mr. Crosby, the chaplain of the  institution, stating they would not interfere on his behalf. The jury  returned a verdict of _guilty_. Mr. Justice Park observed, that the  best course would be to send him out of the country.\"    Here we see, that notwithstanding the discipline he had undergone,  and the instructions he had received during his confinement in the  establishment of the Refuge for the Destitute, he had not been more  than four months from that place before he fell into his old habits.  It is moreover to be remarked, that such had been his conduct during  his confinement, that the directors of the establishment thought  themselves war ranted in giving a good character with him. They were  probably little surprised on hearing of this relapse on the part of  the boy,--experience had doubtless taught them it was no uncommon  thing, and we plainly see they were convinced that all further  attempts at reclaiming him were useless.    The facility with which property maybe disposed of, should be  mentioned as a powerful inducement to crime. The following case  suggests it to the mind:    Thomas Jackson, a mere child, not more than nine years of age, was  charged some time ago at the Town Hall, with committing a burglary  on the premises of Mr. James Whitelock, a master builder, Griffith's  Rents, St. Thomas's, Southwark. Mr. Whitelock, it appears, resided  in an old mansion, formerly an inn, which he had divided into two  separate tenements, occupying one part himself, and letting the other  to the parents of the prisoner. In this division he had deposited  building materials to a considerable amount, one hundred weight of  which, in iron holdfasts, hinges, nails, clamps, &c., he missed one  day on entering the room, the door of which had been blocked by a  large copper, and the partition door forced. The character of the  prisoner being of the worst description, he was apprehended, when  he confessed he had taken all the property, and disposed of it to a  woman, named Priscilla Fletcher, the keeper of a marine store, 34,  James Street. The receiver, who is _the last of the family that has  not been either hanged or transported_, refused to swear to the  prisoner, though she admitted she believed he was the person she  bought the property produced from, at the rate of one penny for each  three pounds. It was proved to be worth three half-pence per pound.  Alderman J.J. Smith regretted that the deficiency of evidence  prevented him sending the young delinquent for trial, and thereby  rescuing him from an ignominious death, and told Mrs. Priscilla, who  was all modesty, that he was convinced she had perjured herself,--and  not to exult at her own escape from transportation, a reward he could  not help considering she richly merited, and which in due season she  would doubtless receive.    The hardened child laughed during the hearing, and on being sentenced,  by the oath of the officers, as a reputed thief, spit at his accuser,  and exclaimed, as he was taken from the bar to be conveyed to  Brixton,--\"Is this all? I'll torment you yet!\"    To add one more case, I may state that, at the Exeter Sessions, some  time since, two children were convicted, who, it "]]]
