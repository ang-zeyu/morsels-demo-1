[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#9)"],[1,"of  Sansovino's Bacchus (also in the Bargello) possesses more of true  Greek inspiration than Michelangelo's. If Michelangelo meant to carve  a Bacchus, he failed; if he meant to imitate a physically desirable  young man in a state of drunkenness, he succeeded.    What Shelley wrote upon this statue may here be introduced, since it  combines both points of view in a criticism of much spontaneous  vigour.    \"The countenance of this figure is the most revolting mistake of the  spirit and meaning of Bacchus. It looks drunken, brutal, and  narrow-minded, and has an expression of dissoluteness the most  revolting. The lower part of the figure is stiff, and the manner in  which the shoulders are united to the breast, and the neck to the  head, abundantly inharmonious. It is altogether without unity, as was  the idea of the deity of Bacchus in the conception of a Catholic. On  the other hand, considered merely as a piece of workmanship, it has  great merits. The arms are executed in the most perfect and manly  beauty; the body is conceived with great energy, and the lines which  describe the sides and thighs, and the manner in which they mingle  into one another, are of the highest order of boldness and beauty. It  wants, as a work of art, unity and simplicity; as a representation of  the Greek deity of Bacchus, it wants everything.\"    Jacopo Gallo is said to have also purchased a Cupid from Michelangelo.  It has been suggested, with great plausibility, that this Cupid was  the piece which Michelangelo began when Piero de' Medici's commission  fell through, and that it therefore preceded the Bacchus in date of  execution. It has also been suggested that the so-called Cupid at  South Kensington is the work in question. We have no authentic  information to guide us in the matter. But the South Kensington Cupid  is certainly a production of the master's early manhood. It was  discovered some forty years ago, hidden away in the cellars of the  Gualfonda (Rucellai) Gardens at Florence, by Professor Miliarini and  the famous Florentine sculptor Santarelli. On a cursory inspection  they both declared it to be a genuine Michelangelo. The left arm was  broken, the right hand damaged, and the hair had never received the  sculptor's final touches. Santarelli restored the arm, and the Cupid  passed by purchase into the possession of the English nation. This  fine piece of sculpture is executed in Michelangelo's proudest, most  dramatic manner. The muscular young man of eighteen, a model of superb  adolescence, kneels upon his right knee, while the right hand is  lowered to lift an arrow from the ground. The left hand is raised  above the head, and holds the bow, while the left leg is so placed,  with the foot firmly pressed upon the ground, as to indicate that in a  moment the youth will rise, fit the shaft to the string, and send it  whistling at his adversary. This choice of a momentary attitude is  eminently characteristic of Michelangelo's style; and, if we are  really to believe that he intended to portray the god of love, it  offers another instance of his independence of classical tradition. No  Greek would have thus represented Eros. The lyric poets, indeed,  Ibycus and Anacreon, imaged him as a fierce invasive deity, descending  like the whirlwind on an oak, or striking at his victim with an axe.  But these romantic ideas did not find expression, so far as I am  aware, in antique plastic art. Michelangelo's Cupid is therefore as  original as his Bacchus. Much as critics have written, and with  justice, upon the classical tendencies of the Italian Renaissance,  they have failed to point out that the Paganism of the Cinque Cento  rarely involved a servile imitation of the antique or a sympathetic  intelligence of its spirit. Least of all do we find either of these  qualities in Michelangelo. He drew inspiration from his own soul, and  he went straight to Nature for the means of expressing the conception  he had formed. Unlike the Greeks, he invariably preferred the  particular to the universal, the critical moment of an action to  suggestions of the possibilities of action. He carved an individual  being, not an abstraction or a generalisation of personality. The  Cupid supplies us with a splendid illustration of this criticism.  Being a product of his early energy, before he had formed a certain  manneristic way of seeing Nature and of reproducing what he saw, it  not only casts light upon the spontaneous working of his genius, but  it also shows how the young artist had already come to regard the  inmost passion of the soul. When quite an old man, rhyming those rough  platonic sonnets, he always spoke of love as masterful and awful. For  his austere and melancholy nature, Eros was no tender or light-winged  youngling, but a masculine tyrant, the tamer of male spirits.  Therefore this Cupid, adorable in the power and beauty of his vigorous  manhood, may well remain for us the myth or symbol of love as  Michelangelo imagined that emotion. In composition, the figure is from  all points of view admirable, presenting a series of nobly varied  line-harmonies. All we have to regret is that time, exposure to  weather, and vulgar outrage should have spoiled the surface of the  marble.      VI    It is natural to turn from the Cupid to another work belonging to the  English nation, which has recently been ascribed to Michelangelo. I  mean the Madonna, with Christ, S. John, and four attendant male  figures, once in the possession of Mr. H. Labouchere, and now in the  National Gallery. We have no authentic tradition regarding this  tempera painting, which in my judgment is the most beautiful of the  easel pictures attributed to Michelangelo. Internal evidence from  style renders its genuineness in the highest degree probable. No one  else upon the close of the fifteenth century was capable of producing  a composition at once so complicated, so harmonious, and so clear as  the group formed by Madonna, Christ leaning on her knee to point a  finger at the book she holds, and the young S. John turned round to  combine these figures with the exquisitely blended youths behind him.  Unfortunately the two angels or genii upon the left hand are  unfinished; but had the picture been completed, we should probably  have been able to point out another magnificent episode in the  composition, determined by the transverse line carried from the hand  upon the last youth's shoulder, through the open book and the upraised  arm of Christ, down to the feet of S. John and the last genius on the  right side. Florentine painters had been wont to place attendant  angels at both sides of their enthroned Madonnas. Fine examples might  be chosen from the work of Filippino Lippi and Botticelli. But their  angels were winged and clothed like acolytes; the Madonna was seated  on a rich throne or under a canopy, with altar-candles, wreaths of  roses, flowering lilies. It is characteristic of Michelangelo to adopt  a conventional motive, and to treat it with brusque originality. In  this picture there are no accessories to the figures, and the  attendant angels are Tuscan lads half draped in succinct tunics. The  style is rather that of a flat relief in stone than of a painting; and  though we may feel something of Ghirlandajo's influence, the spirit of  Donatello and Luca della Robbia are more apparent. That it was the  work of an inexperienced painter is shown by the failure to indicate  pictorial planes. In spite of the marvellous and intricate beauty of  the line-composition, it lacks that effect of graduated distances  which might perhaps have been secured by execution in bronze or  marble. The types have not been chosen with regard to ideal loveliness  or dignity, but accurately studied from living models. This is very  obvious in the heads of Christ and S. John. The two adolescent genii  on the right hand possess a high degree of natural grace. Yet even  here what strikes one most is the charm of their attitude, the lovely  interlacing of their arms and breasts, the lithe alertness of the one  lad contrasted with the thoughtful leaning languor of his comrade.  Only perhaps in some drawings of combined male figures made by Ingres  for his picture of the Golden Age have lines of equal dignity and  simple beauty been developed. I do not think that this Madonna,  supposing it to be a genuine piece by Michelangelo, belongs to the  period of his first residence in Rome. In spite of its immense  intellectual power, it has an air of immaturity. Probably Heath Wilson  was right in assigning it to the time spent at Florence after Lorenzo  de' Medici's death, when the artist was about twenty years of age.    I may take this occasion for dealing summarily with the Entombment in  the National Gallery. The picture, which is half finished, has no  pedigree. It was bought out of the collection of Cardinal Fesch, and  pronounced to be a Michelangelo by the Munich painter Cornelius. Good  judges have adopted this attribution, and to differ from them requires  some hardihood. Still it is painful to believe that at any period of  his life Michelangelo could have produced a composition so discordant,  so unsatisfactory in some anatomical details, so feelingless and ugly.  It bears indubitable traces of his influence; that is apparent in the  figure of the dead Christ. But this colossal nude, with the massive  chest and attenuated legs, reminds us of his manner in old age;  whereas the rest of the picture shows no trace of that manner. I am  inclined to think that the Entombment was the production of a  second-rate craftsman, working upon some design made by Michelangelo  at the advanced period when the Passion of our Lord occupied his  thoughts in Rome. Even so, the spirit of the drawing must have been  imperfectly assimilated; and, what is more puzzling, the composition  does not recall the style of Michelangelo's old age.

It goes down below and up above. On the stairs and on the floor near  them there are muddy footmarks. These must have been made to-day, else  they would not be muddy, but dry and dusty, since there hasn't been a  shower for a week till to-day. Move on again. Then you noticed that there  were no other such marks in the shop. Consequently the man with the muddy  feet did not come in by the front door, but by the back; otherwise he  would have made a trail from the door. So we will go round to the back  ourselves.\"    It was now growing dusk. The small pieces of ground behind the shops were  bounded by a low fence, containing a door for each house.    \"This door is bolted inside, of course,\" Hewitt said, \"but there is no  difficulty in climbing. I think we had better wait in the garden till  dark. In the meantime, the jailer, whoever he is, may come out; in which  case we shall pounce on him as soon as he opens the door. You have that  few yards of cord in your pocket, I think? And my handkerchief, properly  rolled, will make a very good gag. Now over.\"    They climbed the fence and quietly approached the house, placing  themselves in the angle of an outhouse out of sight from the windows.  There was no sound, and no light appeared. Just above the ground about a  foot of window was visible, with a grating over it, apparently lighting a  basement. Suddenly Hewitt touched his companion's arm and pointed toward  the window. A faint rustling sound was perceptible, and, as nearly as  could be discerned in the darkness, some white blind or covering was  placed over the glass from the inside. Then came the sound of a striking  match, and at the side edge of the window there was a faint streak of  light.    \"That's the place,\" Hewitt whispered. \"Come, we'll make a push for it. You  stand against the wall at one side of the door and I'll stand at the  other, and we'll have him as he comes out. Quietly, now, and I'll startle  them.\"    He took a stone from among the rubbish littering the garden and flung it  crashing through the window. There was a loud exclamation from within, the  blind fell, and somebody rushed to the back door and flung it open.  Instantly Kentish let fly a heavy right-hander, and the man went over like  a skittle. In a moment Hewitt was upon him and the gag in his mouth.    \"Hold him,\" Hewitt whispered, hurriedly. \"I'll see if there are others.\"    He peered down through the low window. Within Sammy Crockett, his bare  legs dangling from beneath his long overcoat, sat on a packing-box,  leaning with his head on his hand and his back toward the window. A  guttering candle stood on the mantel-piece, and the newspaper which had  been stretched across the window lay in scattered sheets on the floor. No  other person besides Sammy was visible.    They led their prisoner indoors. Young Kentish recognized him as a  public-house loafer and race-course ruffian, well known in the  neighborhood.    \"So it's you, is it, Browdie?\" he said. \"I've caught you one hard clump,  and I've half a mind to make it a score more. But you'll get it pretty  warm one way or another before this job's forgotten.\"    Sammy Crockett was overjoyed at his rescue. He had not been ill-treated,  he explained, but had been thoroughly cowed by Browdie, who had from time  to time threatened him savagely with an iron bar by way of persuading him  to quietness and submission. He had been fed, and had taken no worse harm  than a slight stiffness from his adventure, due to his light under-attire  of jersey and knee-shorts.    Sergeant Kentish tied Browdie's elbows firmly together behind, and carried  the line round the ankles, bracing all up tight. Then he ran a knot from  one wrist to the other over the back of the neck, and left the prisoner,  trussed and helpless, on the heap of straw that had been Sammy's bed.    \"You won't be very jolly, I expect,\" Kentish said, \"for some time. You  can't shout and you can't walk, and I know you can't untie yourself.  You'll get a bit hungry, too, perhaps, but that'll give you an appetite. I  don't suppose you'll be disturbed till some time to-morrow, unless our  friend Danby turns up in the meantime. But you can come along to jail  instead, if you prefer it.\"    They left him where he lay, and took Sammy to the old landau. Sammy walked  in slippers, carrying his spiked shoes, hanging by the lace, in his hand.    \"Ah,\" said Hewitt, \"I think I know the name of the young lady who gave you  those slippers.\"    Crockett looked ashamed and indignant. \"Yes,\" he said, \"they've done me  nicely between 'em. But I'll pay her--I'll----\"    \"Hush, hush!\" Hewitt said; \"you mustn't talk unkindly of a lady, you know.  Get into this carriage, and we'll take you home. We'll see if I can tell  you your adventures without making a mistake. First, you had a note from  Miss Webb, telling you that you were mistaken in supposing she had  slighted you, and that, as a matter of fact, she had quite done with  somebody else--left him--of whom you were jealous. Isn't that so?\"    \"Well, yes,\" young Crockett answered, blushing deeply under the  carriage-lamp; \"but I don't see how you come to know that.\"    \"Then she went on to ask you to get rid of Steggles on Thursday afternoon  for a few minutes, and speak to her in the back lane. Now, your running  pumps, with their thin soles, almost like paper, no heels and long spikes,  hurt your feet horribly if you walk on hard ground, don't they?\"    \"Ay, that they do--enough to cripple you. I'd never go on much hard ground  with 'em.\"    \"They're not like cricket shoes, I see.\"    \"Not a bit. Cricket shoes you can walk anywhere in!\"    \"Well, she knew this--I think I know who told her--and she promised to  bring you a new pair of slippers, and to throw them over the fence for you  to come out in.\"    \"I s'pose she's been tellin' you all this?\" Crockett said, mournfully.  \"You couldn't ha' seen the letter; I saw her tear it up and put the bits  in her pocket. She asked me for it in the lane, in case Steggles saw it.\"    \"Well, at any rate, you sent Steggles away, and the slippers did come  over, and you went into the lane. You walked with her as far as the road  at the end, and then you were seized and gagged, and put into a carriage.\"    \"That was Browdie did that,\" said Crockett, \"and another chap I don't  know. But--why, this is Padfield High Street?\" He looked through the  window and regarded the familiar shops with astonishment.    \"Of course it is. Where did you think it was?\"    \"Why, where was that place you found me in?\"    \"Granville Road, Padfield. I suppose they told you you were in another  town?\"    \"Told me it was Newstead Hatch. They drove for about three or four hours,  and kept me down on the floor between the seats so as I couldn't see where  we was going.\"    \"Done for two reasons,\" said Hewitt. \"First, to mystify you, and prevent  any discovery of the people directing the conspiracy; and second, to be  able to put you indoors at night and unobserved. Well, I think I have told  you all you know yourself now as far as the carriage.    \"But there is the Hare and Hounds just in front. We'll pull up here, and  I'll get out and see if the coast is clear. I fancy Mr. Kentish would  rather you came in unnoticed.\"    In a few seconds Hewitt was back, and Crockett was conveyed indoors by a  side entrance. Hewitt's instructions to the landlord were few, but  emphatic. \"Don't tell Steggles about it,\" he said; \"make an excuse to get  rid of him, and send him out of the house. Take Crockett into some other  bedroom, not his own, and let your son look after him. Then come here, and  I'll tell you all about it.\"    Sammy Crockett was undergoing a heavy grooming with white embrocation at  the hands of Sergeant Kentish when the landlord returned to Hewitt. \"Does  Danby know you've got him?\" he asked. \"How did you do it?\"    \"Danby doesn't know yet, and with luck he won't know till he sees Crockett  running to-morrow. The man who has sold you is Steggles.\"    \"Steggles?\"    \"Steggles it is. At the very first, when Steggles rushed in to report  Sammy Crockett missing, I suspected him. You didn't, I suppose?\"    \"No. He's always been considered a straight man, and he looked as startled  as anybody.\"    \"Yes, I must say he acted it very well. But there was something suspicious  in his story. What did he say? Crockett had remarked a chilliness, and  asked for a sweater, which Steggles went to fetch. Now, just think. You  understand these things. Would any trainer who knew his business (as  Steggles does) have gone to bring out a sweater for his man to change for  his jersey in the open air, at the very time the man was complaining of  chilliness? Of course not. He would have taken his man indoors again and  let him change there under shelter. Then supposing Steggles had really  been surprised at missing Crockett, wouldn't he have looked about, found  the gate open, and _told_ you it was open when he first came in? He said  nothing of that--we found the gate open for ourselves. So that from the  beginning I had a certain opinion of Steggles.\"    \"What you say seems pretty plain now, although it didn't strike me at the  time. But, if Steggles was selling us, why couldn't he have drugged the  lad? That would have been a deal simpler.\"    \"Because Steggles is a good trainer, and has a certain reputation to keep  up. It would have done him no good to have had a runner drugged while  under his care; certainly it would have cooked his goose with _you_. It  was much the safer thing to connive at kidnapping. That put all the active  work into other hands, and left him safe, even if the trick failed. Now,  you remember that we traced the prints of Crockett's spiked shoes to  within a couple of yards from the fence, and that there they ceased  suddenly?\"    \"Yes. You said it looked as though he had flown up into the air;"]]]
