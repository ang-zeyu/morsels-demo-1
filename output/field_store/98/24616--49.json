Nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular  motion and circular orbits until the insight, boldness, and  independence of Johann Kepler opened up a new world of thought and of  intellectual delight.    While at work on the Rudolphine tables he used the old epicycles and  deferents and excentrics, but he could not make theory agree with  observation. His instincts told him that these apologists for uniform  motion were a fraud; and he proved it to himself by trying every  possible variation of the elements and finding them fail.  The number  of hypotheses which he examined and rejected was almost incredible  (for example, that the planets turn round centres at a little distance  from the sun, that the epicycles have centres at a little distance  from the deferent, and so on). He says that, after using all these  devices to make theory agree with Tycho's observations, he still found  errors amounting to eight minutes of a degree. Then he said boldly  that it was impossible that so good an observer as Tycho could have  made a mistake of eight minutes, and added: \"Out of these eight  minutes we will construct a new theory that will explain the motions  of all the planets.\" And he did it, with elliptic orbits having the  sun in a focus of each.[2]    It is often difficult to define the boundaries between fancies,  imagination, hypothesis, and sound theory.  This extraordinary genius  was a master in all these modes of attacking a problem. His analogy  between the spaces occupied by the five regular solids and the  distances of the planets from the sun, which filled him with so much  delight, was a display of pure fancy. His demonstration of the three  fundamental laws of planetary motion was the most strict and complete  theory that had ever been attempted.    It has been often suggested that the revival by Copernicus of the  notion of a moving earth was a help to Kepler. No one who reads  Kepler's great book could hold such an opinion for a moment. In fact,  the excellence of Copernicus's book helped to prolong the life of the  epicyclical theories in opposition to Kepler's teaching.    All of the best theories were compared by him with observation. These  were the Ptolemaic, the Copernican, and the Tychonic. The two latter  placed all of the planetary orbits concentric with one another, the  sun being placed a little away from their common centre, and having no  apparent relation to them, and being actually outside the planes in  which they move.  Kepler's first great discovery was that the planes  of all the orbits pass through the sun; his second was that the line  of apses of each planet passes through the sun; both were  contradictory to the Copernican theory.    He proceeds cautiously with his propositions until he arrives at his  great laws, and he concludes his book by comparing observations of  Mars, of all dates, with his theory.    His first law states that the planets describe ellipses with the sun  at a focus of each ellipse.    His second law (a far more difficult one to prove) states that a line  drawn from a planet to the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal  times. These two laws were published in his great work, _Astronomia  Nova, sen.  Physica Coelestis tradita commentariis de Motibus Stelloe;  Martis_, Prague, 1609.    It took him nine years more[3] to discover his third law, that the  squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the  mean distances from the sun.    These three laws contain implicitly the law of universal  gravitation. They are simply an alternative way of expressing that law  in dealing with planets, not particles. Only, the power of the  greatest human intellect is so utterly feeble that the meaning of the  words in Kepler's three laws could not be understood until expounded  by the logic of Newton's dynamics.    The joy with which Kepler contemplated the final demonstration of  these laws, the evolution of which had occupied twenty years, can  hardly be imagined by us.  He has given some idea of it in a passage  in his work on _Harmonics_, which is not now quoted, only lest  someone might say it was egotistical--a term which is simply grotesque  when applied to such a man with such a life's work accomplished.    The whole book, _Astronomia Nova_, is a pleasure to read; the  mass of observations that are used, and the ingenuity of the  propositions, contrast strongly with the loose and imperfectly  supported explanations of all his predecessors; and the indulgent  reader will excuse the devotion of a few lines to an example of the  ingenuity and beauty of his methods.    It may seem a hopeless task to find out the true paths of Mars and the  earth (at that time when their shape even was not known) from the  observations giving only the relative direction from night to  night. Now, Kepler had twenty years of observations of Mars to deal  with. This enabled him to use a new method, to find the earth's  orbit. Observe the date at any time when Mars is in opposition. The  earth's position E at that date gives the longitude of Mars M. His  period is 687 days. Now choose dates before and after the principal  date at intervals of 687 days and its multiples.  Mars is in each case  in the same position. Now for any date when Mars is at M and the earth  at E3 the date of the year gives the angle E3SM. And the  observation of Tycho gives the direction of Mars compared with the  sun, SE3M. So all the angles of the triangle SEM in any of these  positions of E are known, and also the ratios of SE1, SE2, SE3,  SE4 to SM and to each other.    For the orbit of Mars observations were chosen at intervals of a year,  when the earth was always in the same place.    [Illustration]    But Kepler saw much farther than the geometrical facts. He realised  that the orbits are followed owing to a force directed to the sun; and  he guessed that this is the same force as the gravity that makes a  stone fall. He saw the difficulty of gravitation acting through the  void space.  He compared universal gravitation to magnetism, and  speaks of the work of Gilbert of Colchester.  (Gilbert's book, _De  Mundo Nostro Sublunari, Philosophia Nova_, Amstelodami, 1651,  containing similar views, was published forty-eight years after  Gilbert's death, and forty-two years after Kepler's book and  reference.  His book _De Magnete_ was published in 1600.)    A few of Kepler's views on gravitation, extracted from the  Introduction to his _Astronomia Nova_, may now be mentioned:--    1. Every body at rest remains at rest if outside the attractive power  of other bodies.    2. Gravity is a property of masses mutually attracting in such manner  that the earth attracts a stone much more than a stone attracts the  earth.    3. Bodies are attracted to the earth's centre, not because it is the  centre of the universe, but because it is the centre of the attracting  particles of the earth.    4. If the earth be not round (but spheroidal?), then bodies at  different latitudes will not be attracted to its centre, but to  different points in the neighbourhood of that centre.    5. If the earth and moon were not retained in their orbits by vital  force (_aut alia aligua aequipollenti_), the earth and moon would come  together.    6. If the earth were to cease to attract its waters, the oceans would  all rise and flow to the moon.    7. He attributes the tides to lunar attraction.  Kepler had been  appointed Imperial Astronomer with a handsome salary (on paper), a  fraction of which was doled out to him very irregularly. He was led to  miserable makeshifts to earn enough to keep his family from  starvation; and proceeded to Ratisbon in 1630 to represent his claims  to the Diet. He arrived worn out and debilitated; he failed in his  appeal, and died from fever, contracted under, and fed upon,  disappointment and exhaustion. Those were not the days when men could  adopt as a profession the \"research of endowment.\"    Before taking leave of Kepler, who was by no means a man of one idea,  it ought to be here recorded that he was the first to suggest that a  telescope made with both lenses convex (not a Galilean telescope) can  have cross wires in the focus, for use as a pointer to fix accurately  the positions of stars. An Englishman, Gascoigne, was the first to use  this in practice.    From the all too brief epitome here given of Kepler's greatest book,  it must be obvious that he had at that time some inkling of the  meaning of his laws--universal gravitation. From that moment the idea  of universal gravitation was in the air, and hints and guesses were  thrown out by many; and in time the law of gravitation would doubtless  have been discovered, though probably not by the work of one man, even  if Newton had not lived. But, if Kepler had not lived, who else could  have discovered his laws?      FOOTNOTES:    [1] When the writer visited M. D'Arrest, the astronomer, at  Copenhagen, in 1872, he was presented by D'Arrest with one of several  bricks collected from the ruins of Uraniborg. This was one of his most  cherished possessions until, on returning home after a prolonged  absence on astronomical work, he found that his treasure had been  tidied away from his study.    [2] An ellipse is one of the plane, sections of a cone. It is an oval  curve, which may be drawn by fixing two pins in a sheet of paper at S  and H, fastening a string, SPH, to the two pins, and stretching it  with a pencil point at P, and moving the pencil point, while the  string is kept taut, to trace the oval ellipse, APB. S and H are the  _foci_. Kepler found the sun to be in one focus, say S. AB is the  _major axis_. DE is the _minor axis_. C is the _centre_. The direction  of AB is the _line of apses_. The ratio of CS to CA is the  _excentricity_. The position of the planet at A is the _perihelion_  (nearest to the sun). The position of the planet at B is the  _aphelion_ (farthest from the sun).
