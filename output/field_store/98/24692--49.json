On the principle that you can't have the services of a good piper  without paying proportionately dear for them, so you can't obtain a  handsome chapel except by confronting a long bill. The elysium of  antipedobaptism in Fishergate cost the modest sum of 5,000 pounds,  and of that amount about 800 pounds remains to be paid. Considering  the greatness of the original sum, the debt is not very large; but  if it were less the congregation would be none the worse; and if it  didn't exist at all they would be somewhat nearer bliss in this  general vale of tears. Fishergate Baptist Chapel is the only  Dissenting place of worship in the town possessing an exterior  clock; and it is one of the most orderly articles in the town, for  it never strikes and has not for many months shown itself after  dark. It used to exhibit signs of activity after sunset; but it was,  considered a \"burning shame\" by some economists to light it up with  gas when the Town Hall clock was got into working order, and ever  since then it has been nightly kept in the dark.    Fishergate Baptist Chapel has an excellent interior, and it will  accommodate about twice as many people as patronise it. Long stately  side lights, neatly embellised with stained glass and opaque  filigree work, give it a mild solemnity which is relieved by fine  circular windows occupying the gables. The seats are arranged in the  usual three-row style, and there is a touch of neat gentility about  them indicative of good construction, whatever the parties they have  been made for are like. Fashionably-conceived gas-stands shoot up  and spread their branches at intervals down the chapel; and at the  extreme end there is a broad gallery, set apart for the singers, who  need be in no fear of breaking it down through either the weight of  their melodious metal or the specific gravity of their physique. A  new organ is much wanted, and if a few new singers were secured, or  the old ones polished up slightly, the proceedings would be more  lively and agreeable. Nearly three of the members of the choir are  really good singers; the remainder are what may be termed only  moderate. What Lune-street is to the Wesleyans, so Fishergate seems  to be to the Baptists--the centre of gravity of the more refined and  fashionable worshippers. Very few poor people visit it, and it is  thought that if they don't come of their own accord they will never  he seriously pressed on the subject. The free sittings are just  within the door, on the left hand side, and we should fancy that not  more than 25 really poor people use them. The higher order of  Christians occupy the lower portion of the same range of seats, the  central pews, and those on the right side thereof.    The congregation consists almost entirely of middle-class persons--  people who have either saved money in business or who are making a  determined effort to do so. Good clothes, quiet demeanour, and  numerical smallness are the striking characteristics. Nothing  approaching fervour ever takes possession of the general body.  Religion with them is not a termagant, revered for her sauciness and  loved for her violent evolutions. It is a reticent, even spirited,  calmly orthodox affair, whose forerunner fed on locusts and wild  honey, and whose principles are to be digested quietly. There may be  a few very boisterous sheep in the fold, who get on fire  periodically in the warmth of speaking and praying; who will express  their willingness, when the pressure is up, to do any mortal thing  for the good of \"the cause;\" but who will have to be caught there  and then if anything substantial has to follow. Like buckwheat cakes  and rum gruel they are best whilst hot. At a night meeting they may  be generously disposed and full of universal sympathy; but they can  sleep out their burning thoughts in a few hours, and waken up next  morning like larks, with no recollection of their gushing promises.    There is accomodation in the chapel for about 400 persons, but the  average attendance is not more than 200; and there are only about 90  \"members.\" Not much difference between the morning and evening  attendance is noticed. The baptismal Thermophylae is generally  guarded by the sacred 90, and looked at by the fuller 200. The pew  rents are very high; but this evil is compensated for by the  comparative absence of those solemn gad flies which come in the  shape of collections. At some places of worship contribution boxes  and bags are seen floating about rapidly nearly every other Sunday,  for either home expenses or perishing Indians; but at Fishergate  Baptist Chapel incidental requirements are blended with the pew  rents; and for other purposes about two collections annually  suffice. That is all, and that ought to make attendance at such a  place rather agreeable.    The primal government of the chapel is in the hands of four deacons;  but they are not very officious like some pillars of the church:  one of them is mild and obliging, the second is wise-looking and  crotchety, the third is disposed to pious rampagiousness in his  lucid intervals, and the fourth is a kindly sort of being, with a  moderate respect for converted dancers and hallaleujah men. Some  theological writers say that there are \"evangelists\" as well as  deacons in connection with Baptist government. There may be some of  this class at the Fishergate Chapel; but we have not yet seen their  sacred personages. The place is highly favoured with clocks. Not  only is there a specimen of horology outside, but there is one  within, and it may be called a worldly-wise creature, for it never  gets beyond No. I in its striking. Tradition hath it that once when  there was no clock in the chapel, the preacher used to overshoot  most uncomfortably the ordinary limits of time; that the  congregation, whilst fond of sermons, did not like them stretched  too violently; and that they resolved unanimously to purchase a  clock. Probably this story is groundless; but it is a fact  nevertheless that the clock is so situated as to be only fully and  easily seen by the preacher. More than three-fourths of the people  sit with their backs directly to it. And it is furthermore a fact  that, whilst when there was no clock the usual time of deliverance  was passed, the congregation are now released with scrupulous  exactitude. They got into the open air one Sunday evening when we  were there about 16 seconds before eight, and the preacher had  abandoned the pulpit by the time the Town Hall clock gave its  opinion on the question.    In winter there is a Sunday morning prayer meeting at the place; but  in summer the members can't stand such a gathering, either because  too much light is thrown upon the subject, or because the attendance  is too small, or because early prayers are not required at that  season of the year. A prayer meeting is, however, held all the year  round, on a Wednesday night, and it is favoured, on an average, with  about 20 earnest individuals, who sometimes create what might, if  not properly explained, be considered a rather solemn disturbance.  These parties meet in the Sunday school, which is beneath the  chapel. The average attendance of scholars at this school is not  very large. When buns and coffee are astir it may be computed at  200; when ordinary religious instruction is simply placed before the  juvenile mind the attendance may be set down at about 100.    In the chapel and immediately before the pulpit, there is a square  hole, usually covered, which in denominational phraseology goes by  the name of the \"baptistery.\" In the first ages of Christianity such  places were made outside the church, and were either hexagonal or  octagonal, then they became polygonal, then circular, and now they  have got quadrangular. Two of the finest baptisteries in the world  are at Florence and Pisa; that at the former, place being 100 feet  in diameter, made of black and white marble, and surrounded with a  gallery on granite columns; that at the latter being 116 feet wide,  and beautifully ornamented. The biggest baptistery ever made is  supposed to have been that at St. Sophia, in Constantinople, which,  we are told, was so spacious as to have once served for the  residence of the Emperor Basilicus. But there is no marble about the  baptistery in Fishergate Chapel, and no one would ever think of  transmuting it into a residence. It is used two or three times a  year, and if outsiders happen to get a whisper of an intended  dipping, curiosity leads them to the chapel, and they look upon the  ceremony as a piece of sacred fun, right enough to look at, but far  too wet for anything else. This dipping is, indeed, a quaint, cold  piece of business. None except adults or youths who have, it is  thought, come to sense and reason, are permitted to pass through the  ordeal, and it is recognised by them as symbolic of their entrance  into \"the Church.\" Sometimes as many as six or seven are immersed.  They put on old or special garments suitable for the occasion, and  the work of baptism is then carried on by the minister, who stands  in the figurative Jordan. He quietly ducks them overhead; they  submit to the process without a murmur; they neither bubble, nor  scream, nor squirm; and the elders look on solemnly, though  impressed with thoughts that, excellent as the ceremony may be, it  is a rather shivering sort of business after all. After being  baptised, the new members retire into an adjoining room, strip their  saturated cloths, rub themselves briskly with towels, or get the  deacons to do the work for them, then re-dress, comb their hair, and  receive liberty to rejoice with the general Israel of the flock.  Such baptism as that we have described seems a rather curious kind  of rite; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#9)"],[1,"by the greatest tyrants. Although political  liberty was dead, the fullest personal liberty was enjoyed under the  emperors, and it was under their sanction that jurisprudence in some of  the most important departments of life reached perfection. If injustice  was suffered it was not on account of the laws, but owing to the  depravity of men, the venality of the rich, and the tricks of lawyers;  the laws were wise and equal. The civil jurisprudence of the Romans  could be copied with safety by the most enlightened of European States;  indeed, it is already the foundation of their civil codes, especially in  France and Germany.    That there were some features in the Roman laws which we in these  Christian times cannot indorse, and which we reprehend, cannot be  denied. Under the republic there was not sufficient limit to paternal  power, and the _pater familias_ was necessarily a tyrant. It was unjust  that the father should control the property of his son, and cruel that  he was allowed an absolute control not only over his children, but also  his wife. Yet the limits of paternal power were more and more curtailed,  so that under the later emperors fathers were not allowed to have more  authority than was perhaps expedient.    The recognition of slavery as a domestic institution was another blot,  and slaves could be treated with the grossest cruelty and injustice  without possibility of redress. But here the Romans were not sinners  beyond all other nations, and our modern times have witnessed a  parallel. It was not the existence of slavery, however, which was the  greatest evil, but the facility by which slaves could be made. The laws  pertaining to debt were severe, and were most disgraceful in dooming a  debtor to the absolute power of a creditor. To subject men of the same  race to slavery for trifling debts which they could not discharge, was  the great defect of the Roman laws. But even these cruel regulations  were modified, so that in the corrupt times of the empire there was no  greater practical severity than was common in England as late as one  hundred years ago. The temptations to fraud were enormous in a wicked  state of society, and demanded a severe remedy. It is possible that our  modern laws may show too great leniency to debtors who are not merely  unfortunate, but dishonest. The problem is not yet solved, whether men  should be severely handled who are guilty of reckless and unprincipled  speculations and unscrupulous dealings, or whether they should be  allowed immunity to prosecute their dangerous and disgraceful courses.    Moreover, the penal code of the Romans in reference to breaches of trust  or carelessness or ignorance, by which property was lost or squandered,  may have been too severe, as is still the case in England in reference  to hunting game on another's grounds. It was hard to doom a man to death  who drove away his neighbor's cattle, or even entered in the night his  neighbor's house; but severe penalties alone will keep men from crimes  where there is a low state of virtue and religion, and general  prosperity and contentment become impossible where there is no efficient  protection to property. Society was never more secure and happy in  England than when vagabonds could be arrested, and when petty larcenies  were visited with certain retribution. Every traveller in France and  England feels that in regard to the punishment of crime, those older  countries, restricted as are their political privileges, are in most  questions of secure and comfortable living vastly superior to our own.  The Romans lost under the emperors their political rights, but gained  protection and safety in their relations with society. Where quiet and  industrious citizens feel safe in their homes, are protected from  scoundrels in their dealings, have ample scope for industrial  enterprise, and are free to choose their private pleasures, they resign  themselves to the loss of electing their rulers without great  unhappiness. There are greater evils in the world than the deprivation  of the elective franchise, lofty and glorious as is this privilege. The  arbitrary rule of the emperors was fatal to political aspirations and  rights and the growth of a genuine manhood; yet it is but fair to note  that the evils of political slavery were qualified and set off by the  excellence of the civil code and the privileges of social freedom.    The great practical evil connected with Roman jurisprudence was the  intricacy and perplexity and uncertainty of the laws, together with the  expense involved in litigation. The class of lawyers was large, and  their gains were extortionate. Justice was not always to be found on the  side of right. The law was uncertain as well as costly. The most learned  counsel could be employed only by the rich, and even judges were venal,  so that the poor did not easily find adequate redress. But all this is  the necessary attendant on a factitious state of society, and by many is  regarded as being quite as characteristic of modern, civilized Christian  England and America as it was of Pagan Rome. Material civilization leads  to an undue estimate of money; and when money purchases all that  artificial people desire, then all classes will prostitute themselves  for its possession, and justice, dignity, and elevation of sentiment  will be forced to retreat,--as hermits sought a solitude when society  had reached its lowest degradation, out of pure despair of its  renovation.           *       *       *       *       *    AUTHORITIES.      The authorities for this chapter are very numerous. Since the Institutes  of Gaius have been recovered, many eminent writers on Roman law have  appeared, especially in Germany and France. Many might be cited, but for  all ordinary purposes of historical study the work of Lord Mackenzie on  Roman Law, together with the articles of George Long in Smith's  Dictionary, will be found most useful. Maine's Treatise on Ancient Law  is exceedingly interesting and valuable. Gibbon's famous chapter should  also be read by every student. There is a fine translation of the  Institutes of Justinian, which is quite accessible, by Dr. Harris of  Oxford. The Code, Pandects, Institutes, and Novels are of course the  original authority, with the long-lost Institutes of Gaius.    In connection with the study of the Roman law, it would be well to read  Sir George Bowyer's Commentaries on the Modern Civil Law. Also Irving,  Introduction to the Study of the Civil Law; Lindley, Introduction to the  Study of Jurisprudence; Wheaton's Elements of International Law; and  Vattel, Le Droit des Gens.          THE FINE ARTS.      ARCHITECTURE, SCULPTURE, PAINTING.    500-430 B.C.      My object in the present lecture is not a criticism of the principles  of art so much as an enumeration of its various forms among the  ancients, to show that in this department of civilization they reached  remarkable perfection, and were not inferior to modern Christian nations.    The first development of art among all the nations of antiquity was in  architecture. The earliest buildings erected were houses to protect  people from heat, cold, and the fury of the elements of Nature. At that  remote period much more attention was given to convenience and practical  utility than to beauty or architectural effect. The earliest houses were  built of wood, and stone was not employed until temples and palaces  arose. Ordinary houses were probably not much better than log-huts and  hovels, until wealth was accumulated by private persons.    The earliest monuments of enduring magnificence were the temples of  powerful priests and the palaces of kings; and in Egypt and Assyria  these appear earliest, as well as most other works showing civilization.  Perhaps the first great monument which arose after the deluge of Noah  was the Tower of Babel, built probably of brick. It was intended to be  very lofty, but of its actual height we know nothing, nor of its style  of architecture. Indeed, we do not know that it was ever advanced beyond  its foundations; yet there are some grounds for supposing that it was  ultimately finished, and became the principal temple of the Chaldaean  metropolis.    From the ruins of ancient monuments we conclude that architecture  received its earliest development in Egypt, and that its effects were  imposing, massive, and grand. It was chiefly directed to the erection of  palaces and temples, the ruins of which attest grandeur and vastness.  They were built of stone, in blocks so huge and heavy that even modern  engineers are at loss to comprehend how they could have been transported  and erected. All the monuments of the Pharaohs are wonders, especially  such as appear in the ruins of Karnak,--a temple formerly designated as  that of Jupiter Ammon. It was in the time of Sesostris, or Rameses the  Great, the first of the Pharaohs of the nineteenth dynasty, that  architecture in Egypt reached its greatest development. Then we find the  rectangular-cut blocks of stone in parallel courses, the heavy pier, the  cylindrical column with its bell-shaped capital, and the bold and  massive rectangular architraves extending from pier to pier and column  to column, surmounted by a deep covered coping or cornice.    The imposing architecture of Egypt was chiefly owing to the impressive  vastness of the public buildings. It was not produced by beauty of  proportion or graceful embellishments; it was designed to awe the  people, and kindle sentiments of wonder and astonishment. So far as this  end was contemplated it was nobly reached; even to this day the  traveller stands in admiring amazement before those monuments that were  old three thousand years ago. No structures have been so enduring as the  Pyramids; no ruins are more extensive and majestic than those of Thebes.  The temple of Karnak and the palace of Rameses the Great were probably  the most imposing ever built by man."]]]
