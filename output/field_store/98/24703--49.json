It looks as if there were a layer of bark, ending with the scar,  fastened over each side of the stem. These apparent layers alternate as  well as the scars. The epidermis, or skin of the leaves, is in fact always  continuous with that of the stem. There are no dots on the leaf-scars.    The rings are not nearly so noticeable as in Horsechestnut, but they can  be counted for some years back.    The flower-cluster can often be traced by a dried bit of stem remaining on  the branch.    The terminal bud in the Lilac does not usually develop, and the two  uppermost axillary buds take its place, giving to the shrub the forked  character of its branching. In all these bud studies, the pupil should  finish by showing how the arrangement of the buds determines the growth of  the branches.      QUESTIONS ON THE LILAC.    How do the scales differ from those of Horsechestnut?    How many scales and leaves are there?    How are they arranged?    Where does the flower-cluster come in the bud?    Do all the buds contain flower-clusters?    How does the arrangement of leaves and flower-clusters differ from that of  Horsechestnut?    How old is your branch?    Which buds develop most frequently?    How does this affect the appearance of the shrub?      COPPER BEECH (_Fagus sylvatica, var. purpurea_).    The buds are long and tapering, the scales thin and scarious, the outer  naked, the inner with long, silky hairs. Remove the scales one by one, as  in Lilac. The outer four or six pairs are so minute that the arrangement  is not very clear, but as we proceed we perceive that the scales are in  alternate pairs, as in Horsechestnut; that is, that two scales are exactly  on the same plane. But we have learned in the Lilac that the scales are  modified leaves, and follow the leaf-arrangement of the species. The  Beech is alternate-leaved, and we should therefore expect the scales to  alternate. The explanation is found as we go on removing the scales. At  the eighth or ninth pair we come upon a tiny, silky leaf, directly between  the pair of scales, and, removing these, another larger leaf, opposite the  first but higher up on the rudimentary stem, and so on, with the rest of  the bud. There are five or more leaves, each placed between a pair of  scales. Our knowledge of the parts of a leaf shows us at once that the  scales must be modified stipules, and that therefore they must be in  pairs.[1] Other examples of scales homologous with stipules are the  American Elm, Tulip-tree, Poplar and Magnolia. The leaves are plaited  on the veins and covered with long, silky hairs. The venation is very  distinct. The outer leaves are smaller and, on examining the branch, it  will be seen that their internodes do not make so large a growth as the  leaves in the centre of the bud.    [Footnote 1: See the stipules of the Pea, p. 31.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Copper Beech. 1. Branch in winter state: _a_,  leaf-scar; _b_, bud-scar. 2. Branch, with leaf-buds expanding, showing the  plicate folding of the leaves.]    The leaf-scars are small, soon becoming merely ridges running half round  the stem.    The bud-rings are very plain and easily counted. For this reason, and  because it branches freely, it is a good tree for measurements of growth,  as is seen in the following tables. Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4: were made by a  class of girls, from fourteen to sixteen, from a tree on my lawn. No. 5  was made by a pupil, whom I taught by correspondence, from a tree of the  same species in another town. No. 6 was made by myself from my own tree.  The measurements of the first four tables were somewhat revised by me, as  they were not perfectly accurate. The pupils should always be cautioned  to measure from the beginning of one set of rings to the beginning of the  next.[1]    [Footnote 1: Care must be taken to select branches well exposed to the  light. Of course there are many circumstances that may aid or hinder the  growth of any particular branch.]    NO. 1.    YEARS. GROWTH OF  1ST BRANCH. 2nd BRANCH. 3RD BRANCH 4TH BRANCH.

One question brought up by these measurements is whether there is any  correspondence in growth between the main axis and its branches. It  appears in these tables that there is a general correspondence, in this  tree at least. In the recitation of the class, whose tables are given  above (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4), we took all the measurements of these four  branches for the year 1885 and added them. We did the same for 1886, and  compared the results. The total growth for 1885 was 31-15/16 inches; for  1886, leaving out the measurement of the twig whose entire growth was in  that year, 109-3/4 inches or nearly 3-1/2 times as much. The proportion  held in a general way throughout, there being only a single case of a  branch where the growth was greater in the first year.[1] But there is a  point that must not be overlooked in this connection. The branches of the  Beech seem to grow about equally well in the first, second, third, or any  succeeding year. In some trees, as the Ash, the axillary buds make a large  growth, and the succeeding terminal buds carry on the branch much more  slowly; in other trees, as the Cherry, a branch grows very slowly in the  first few years and then suddenly takes a start. These facts would appear  in tables of growth, made from branches of these trees, but the addition  of results for any particular year would have no significance.    [Footnote 1: The spring of 1880 was a remarkably early one. Thus I find in  my diary of that year the following entries:--    April 17. The red maples are in full bloom, the elms almost over. The  leaves of the Horsechestnut are quite large. The lilacs are nearly in  leaf. April 24. We went up to Waverley and found bloodroot up, spice bush  out, violets, dog-tooths and anemones, also caltha. April 28. All the  cherries are in full bloom. April 29. Picked an apple blossom in bud,  beautifully pink.    The season was nearly three weeks earlier than usual. 1885 on the other  hand was a late spring.]    In table No. 5, the addition of the measurements for 1885 and 1886 shows  the growth in the latter year to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10738"],[0,"Mahomet, Founder of Islam (#9)"],[1,"isdom. Mahomet  entered upon a period of hesitation and dreariness, doubtful of himself,  of his vision, and of the divine favour. His soul voyaged on dark and  troubled seas and gazed into abysmal spaces. At one time he would receive  the light of the seven Heavens within his mind, and feel upon him the  fervour of the Hebrew prophets of old, and again he would call in vain  upon God, and, and seeking, would be flung back upon a darkness of doubt  more terrible than the lightnings of divine wrath.    In all those exaltations and glooms Khadijah had part; she comforted his  distress and shared his elation until the sorrowful period of the  Fattrah, the pause in the revelation, was past. The period is variously  estimated by the chroniclers, and there are many nebulous and spurious  legends attaching to it, but whatever its length it seems certain that  Mahomet gained within it a fuller knowledge of Jewish and Christian  tenets, probably through Zeid, the Christian slave in his household, and  most accounts agree that the Fattrah was ended by the revelation of the  sura entitled \"The Enwrapped,\" the mandate of the angel Gabriel:      \"O thou enwrapped in thy mantle,    Arise and warn!\"    The explanation of the term \"enwrapped in thy mantle\" shows the  prevailing belief in good and evil spirits characteristic of Mahomet's  time. Wandering on the mountain, he saw in a vision the angel Gabriel  seated on a throne between heaven and earth, and afraid before so much  glory, ran to Khadijah, beseeching her to cover him with his mantle that  the evil spirits whom he felt so near him might be avoided. Thereupon  Gabriel came down to earth and revealed the Sura of Admonition. This  supernatural command would appear to be the translation into the  imaginative world of the peace of mind that descended upon Mahomet, and  the conviction as to the reality of his inspiration following on a time  of despair.    The command fell to one who was peculiarly fitted by nature and  circumstance to obey it effectively. To Mahomet, who knew somewhat the  chaos of religions around him--Pagan, Jewish, and Christian struggling  together in unholy strife--the conception of God's unity, once it  attained the strength of a conviction, necessarily resolved itself into  an admonitory mission. \"There is no God but God,\" therefore all who  believe otherwise have incurred His wrath; hasten then to warn men of  their sins. So his conviction passed out of the region of thought into  action and received upon it the stamp of time and place, becoming thereby  inevitably more circumscribed and intense.    From now onwards the course of Mahomet's life is rendered indisputably  plainer by our possession of that famous and much-maligned document, the  Kuran, virtually a record of his inspired sayings as remembered and  written down by his immediate successors. Apart from its intrinsic value  as the universally recognised vehicle of the Islamic creed, it is of  immense importance as a commentary upon Mahomet's career. When allowance  has been made for its numberless contradictions and repetitions, it still  remains the best means of tracing Mahomet's mental development, as well  as the course of his religious and political dominance. Although the  original document was compiled regardless of chronology, expert  scholarship has succeeded in determining the order of most of it  contents, and if we cannot say the precise sequence of every sura, at  least we can classify each as belonging to one of the two great periods,  the Meccan and Medinan, and may even distinguish with comparative  accuracy three divisions within the former.    After Mahomet's mandate to preach and warn his fellow-men of their peril,  the suras continue intermittently throughout his life. Those of the first  period, when his mission was hardly accepted outside his family, bear  upon them the stamp of a fiery nature, obsessed with its one idea; but  behind the wild words lies a store of energy as yet undiscovered, which  will find no fulfilment but in action. That zeal for an idea which caused  the Kuran to be, expressed itself at first in words alone, but later was  translated into political action, and it is the emptying of this vitality  from his words into his works that is responsible for the contrasting  prose of the later suras.    But no lack of poetic fire is discernible in the suras immediately  following his call to the prophetic office, and from them much may be  gathered as to the depth and intensity of his faith. They are almost  strident with feeling; his sentences fall like blows upon an anvil, crude  in their emphasis, and so swiftly uttered forth from the flame of his  zeal, that they glow with reflected glory:      \"Say, he is God alone,    God the Eternal,    He begetteth not and is not begotten,    There is none like to Him.\"      \"Verily, we have caused It (the Kuran) to descend on the night of        power,    And who shall teach thee what the Night of Power is?    The Night of Power excelleth a thousand months,    Therein descend the angels and the spirit by permission of the Lord.\"      \"By the snorting Chargers,    By those that breathe forth sparks of fire    And those that rush to the attack at morn!    And stir therein the dust aloft,    Cleaving their midmost passage through a host!    Truly man is to his Lord ungrateful,    And of this is himself a witness;    And truly he is covetous in love of this world's good.    Ah, knoweth he not, that when what lies in the grave shall be bared    And that brought forth that is in men's breasts,    Verily in that day shall the Lord be made wise concerning them?\"    After the first fire of prophetic zeal had illuminated him, Mahomet  devoted himself to the conversion of his own household and family.  Khadijah was the first convert, as might have been expected from the  close interdependence of their minds. She had become initiated into his  prophetship almost equally with her husband, and it was her courage and  firm trust in his inspiration that had sustained him during the terrible  period of negation. Zeid, the Christian slave who had helped to mould  Mahomet's thought by his knowledge of Christian doctrine, was his next  convert, but both of these were eclipsed by the devotion to Mahomet's  gospel of Ali, the future warrior, son of Abu Talib, and one destined to  play a foremost part in the foundation of Islam.    Mahomet's gospel then penetrated beyond the confines of his household  with the conversion of his friend Abu Bekr, a successful merchant living  in the same quarter of the town as the Prophet. Abu Bekr, whose honesty  gained him the title of Al-Siddick (the true), and Ali were by far the  most important of Mahomet's \"companions.\" They helped to rule Islam  during Mahomet's lifetime, and after his death took successive charge of  its fortunes. Ali was too young at this time to manifest his qualities as  warrior and ruler, but Abu Bekr was of middle age, and his nature  remained substantially the same as at the inception of Islam. He was of  short stature, with deep-seated eyes and a thoughtful, somewhat undecided  mouth, by nature he was shrewd and intelligent, but possessed little of  that original genius necessary to statesmanship in troublous times. His  mild, sympathetic character endured him to his fellow-men, and his calm  reasonableness earned the gratitude of all who confided in him. He was  never ruled by impulse, and of the fire burning almost indestructibly  within Mahomet he knew nothing.    It is strange to consider what agency brought these two dissimilar souls  into such close relationship. For the rest of his life Mahomet found a  never-failing friend in Abu Bekr, and the attachment between the two,  apart from their common fount of zeal for Islam, must have been such as  is inspired by those of contrasting nature for each other. Mahomet saw a  kindly, almost commonplace man, in whose sweet sanity his troubled soul  could find a little peace. He was burdened at times with over-resolve  that ate into his mind like acid. In Abu Bekr he could find the soothing  influence he so often needed, and after the death of Khadijah this friend  might be said in a measure to take her place. Abu Bekr, on the other  hand, revered his leader as a man of finer, subtler stuff than himself,  more alive to the virtue of speed, filled with a greater daring and a  profounder impulse than he was. Mahomet, in common with most men meriting  the title of great, had a capacity for lifelong friendships as well as  the power of inspiring belief and devotion in others.    Through Abu Bekr five converts were gained for the new religion, of whom  Othman is the most important. His part in the establishment of the  Islamic dominion was no slight one, but at the present he remains simply  one of the early enthusiastic converts to Mahomet's evangel, while he  enwound himself into the fortunes of his teacher by marrying Rockeya, one  of Mahomet's daughters.    The conversion to Islam proceeded slowly but surely among the Kureisch;  several slaves were won over, but at the end of four years only forty  converts had been made, among whom, however, was Bilal, a slave, who  later became the first Muaddzin, or summoner to prayer. During these four  years the suras of the first Meccan period were revealed, and enough may  be gathered from them to judge both the limits of Mahomet's preaching and  the attitude towards it on the part of the Kureisch.    Mahomet was content at this time to emphasise in eloquent, almost  incoherent words his central theme--the unity of God. He calls upon the  people to believe, and warns them of their fate if they refuse. The suras  indicate the attitude of indifference borne by the Kureisch towards  Mahomet's mission at its inception. Wherever there are denunciatory  suras, they are either for the chastisement of unbelievers or, as in Sura  cxi, in revenge for the refusal of his relations to believe in "]]]
