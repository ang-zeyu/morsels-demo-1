[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6593"],[0,"History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (#8)"],[1," any carnal appetite so overpower your reason, or so  totally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with affright and  terror from a crime which carries such punishment always with it?    \"How base and mean must that woman be, how void of that dignity of  mind, and decent pride, without which we are not worthy the name of  human creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest animal,  and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her heavenly  part, to an appetite which she hath in common with the vilest branch  of the creation! For no woman, sure, will plead the passion of love  for an excuse. This would be to own herself the mere tool and bubble  of the man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its  meaning, as it is a laudable, is a rational passion, and can never be  violent but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our  enemies, it means not with that fervent love which we naturally bear  towards our friends; much less that we should sacrifice to them our  lives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our innocence. Now in what  light, but that of an enemy, can a reasonable woman regard the man who  solicits her to entail on herself all the misery I have described to  you, and who would purchase to himself a short, trivial, contemptible  pleasure, so greatly at her expense! For, by the laws of custom, the  whole shame, with all its dreadful consequences, falls intirely upon  her. Can love, which always seeks the good of its object, attempt to  betray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatly to be the loser?  If such corrupter, therefore, should have the impudence to pretend a  real affection for her, ought not the woman to regard him not only as  an enemy, but as the worst of all enemies, a false, designing,  treacherous, pretended friend, who intends not only to debauch her  body, but her understanding at the same time?\"    Here Jenny expressing great concern, Allworthy paused a moment, and  then proceeded: \"I have talked thus to you, child, not to insult you  for what is past and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you  for the future. Nor should I have taken this trouble, but from some  opinion of your good sense, notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have  made; and from some hopes of your hearty repentance, which are founded  on the openness and sincerity of your confession. If these do not  deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this scene of your  shame, where you shall, by being unknown, avoid the punishment which,  as I have said, is allotted to your crime in this world; and I hope,  by repentance, you will avoid the much heavier sentence denounced  against it in the other. Be a good girl the rest of your days, and  want shall be no motive to your going astray; and, believe me, there  is more pleasure, even in this world, in an innocent and virtuous  life, than in one debauched and vicious.    \"As to your child, let no thoughts concerning it molest you; I will  provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now  nothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked man that  seduced you; for my anger against him will be much greater than you  have experienced on this occasion.\"    Jenny now lifted her eyes from the ground, and with a modest look and  decent voice thus began:--    \"To know you, sir, and not love your goodness, would be an argument of  total want of sense or goodness in any one. In me it would amount to  the highest ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the  great degree of goodness you have been pleased to exert on this  occasion. As to my concern for what is past, I know you will spare my  blushes the repetition. My future conduct will much better declare my  sentiments than any professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure  you, sir, that I take your advice much kinder than your generous offer  with which you concluded it; for, as you are pleased to say, sir, it  is an instance of your opinion of my understanding.\"--Here her tears  flowing apace, she stopped a few moments, and then proceeded  thus:--\"Indeed, sir, your kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavour  to deserve this good opinion: for if I have the understanding you are  so kindly pleased to allow me, such advice cannot be thrown away upon  me. I thank you, sir, heartily, for your intended kindness to my poor  helpless child: he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful  for all the favours you shall show him. But now, sir, I must on my  knees entreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the father of  my infant. I promise you faithfully you shall one day know; but I am  under the most solemn ties and engagements of honour, as well as the  most religious vows and protestations, to conceal his name at this  time. And I know you too well, to think you would desire I should  sacrifice either my honour or my religion.\"    Mr Allworthy, whom the least mention of those sacred words was  sufficient to stagger, hesitated a moment before he replied, and then  told her, she had done wrong to enter into such engagements to a  villain; but since she had, he could not insist on her breaking them.  He said, it was not from a motive of vain curiosity he had inquired,  but in order to punish the fellow; at least, that he might not  ignorantly confer favours on the undeserving.    As to these points, Jenny satisfied him by the most solemn assurances,  that the man was entirely out of his reach; and was neither subject to  his power, nor in any probability of becoming an object of his  goodness.    The ingenuity of this behaviour had gained Jenny so much credit with  this worthy man, that he easily believed what she told him; for as she  had disdained to excuse herself by a lie, and had hazarded his further  displeasure in her present situation, rather than she would forfeit  her honour or integrity by betraying another, he had but little  apprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself.    He therefore dismissed her with assurances that he would very soon  remove her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incurred;  concluding with some additional documents, in which he recommended  repentance, saying, \"Consider, child, there is one still to reconcile  yourself to, whose favour is of much greater importance to you than  mine.\"        Chapter viii.    A dialogue between Mesdames Bridget and Deborah; containing more  amusement, but less instruction, than the former.      When Mr Allworthy had retired to his study with Jenny Jones, as hath  been seen, Mrs Bridget, with the good housekeeper, had betaken  themselves to a post next adjoining to the said study; whence, through  the conveyance of a keyhole, they sucked in at their ears the  instructive lecture delivered by Mr Allworthy, together with the  answers of Jenny, and indeed every other particular which passed in  the last chapter.    This hole in her brother's study-door was indeed as well known to Mrs  Bridget, and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous  hole in the wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good  purposes. For by such means Mrs Bridget became often acquainted with  her brother's inclinations, without giving him the trouble of  repeating them to her. It is true, some inconveniences attended this  intercourse, and she had sometimes reason to cry out with Thisbe, in  Shakspeare, \"O, wicked, wicked wall!\" For as Mr Allworthy was a  justice of peace, certain things occurred in examinations concerning  bastards, and such like, which are apt to give great offence to the  chaste ears of virgins, especially when they approach the age of  forty, as was the case of Mrs Bridget. However, she had, on such  occasions, the advantage of concealing her blushes from the eyes of  men; and _De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est  ratio_--in English, \"When a woman is not seen to blush, she doth not  blush at all.\"    Both the good women kept strict silence during the whole scene between  Mr Allworthy and the girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that  gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs Deborah could not help exclaiming  against the clemency of her master, and especially against his  suffering her to conceal the father of the child, which she swore she  would have out of her before the sun set.    At these words Mrs Bridget discomposed her features with a smile (a  thing very unusual to her). Not that I would have my reader imagine,  that this was one of those wanton smiles which Homer would have you  conceive came from Venus, when he calls her the laughter-loving  goddess; nor was it one of those smiles which Lady Seraphina shoots  from the stage-box, and which Venus would quit her immortality to be  able to equal. No, this was rather one of those smiles which might be  supposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august Tisiphone,  or from one of the misses, her sisters.    With such a smile then, and with a voice sweet as the evening breeze  of Boreas in the pleasant month of November, Mrs Bridget gently  reproved the curiosity of Mrs Deborah; a vice with which it seems the  latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against  with great bitterness, adding, \"That, among all her faults, she  thanked Heaven her enemies could not accuse her of prying into the  affairs of other people.\"    She then proceeded to commend the honour and spirit with which Jenny  had acted. She said, she could not help agreeing with her brother,  that there was some merit in the sincerity of her confession, and in  her integrity to her lover: that she had always thought her a very  good girl, and doubted not but she had been seduced by some rascal,  who had been infinitely more to blame than herself, and very probably  had prevailed with her by a promise of marriage, or some other  treacherous proceeding.    This behaviour of Mrs Bridget greatly surprised Mrs Deborah; for this  well-bred woman seldom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6603"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage : 600-1776 King Aethelbert - King George III (#8)"],[1," is most  needful that every man warily keep his oath and his wed. If any  one be constrained to either of these wrongfully, either to  treason against his lord, or to any unlawful aid; then it is  juster to belie than to fulfil. But if he pledge himself to that  which is lawful to fulfil, and in that belie himself, let him  submissively deliver up his weapon and his goods to the keeping of  his friends, and be in prison forty days in a King's tun: let him  there suffer whatever the bishop may prescribe to him...\" Let his  kinsmen feed him, if he has no food. If he escapes, let him be  held a fugitive and be excommunicate of the church.    The word of a bishop and of the king were incontrovertible without  an oath.    The Ten Commandments were written down as this law:    \"The Lord spake these words to Moses, and thus said: I am the Lord  thy God. I led thee out of the land of the Egyptians, and of their  bondage.    1.  Love thou not other strange gods above me.    2.  Utter thou not my name idly, for thou shalt not be guiltless      towards me if thou utter my name idly.    3.  Remember that thou hallow the rest day. Work for yourselves six      days, and on the seventh rest. For in six days, Christ wrought the      heavens and the earth, the seas, and all creatures that are in      them, and rested on the seventh day: and therefore the Lord      hallowed it.    4.  Honor thy father and thy mother whom the Lord hath given thee,      that thou mayst be the longer living on earth.    5.  Slay thou not.    6.  Commit thou not adultery.    7.  Steal thou not.    8.  Say thou not false witness.    9.  Covet thou not thy neighbor's goods unjustly.    10. Make thou not to thyself golden or silver gods.\"    If any one fights in the king's hall, or draws his weapon, and  he be taken; be it in the king's doom, either death, or life, as  he may be willing to grant him. If he escape, and be taken  again, let him pay for himself according to his wergeld, and  make bot for the offence, as well wer as wite, according as he  may have wrought.    If a man fights before a king's ealdorman in the gemot, let him  make bot with wer and wite as it may be right; and before this  120s. to the ealdorman as wite. If he disturbs the folkmote by  drawing his weapon, 120s. to the ealdorman as wite. If any of  this happens before a king's ealdorman's junior, or a king's  priest, 30s. as wite.    If any one fights in a ceorlish man's dwelling, let him make bot  of 6s.to the ceorl. If he draws his weapon but doesn't fight,  let it be half of that. If, however, either of these happens to  a man with a wergeld of 600s., let it increase threefold of the  ceorlish bot; and if to a man with a wergeld of 1200s., let it  increase twofold of the bot of the man with a wergeld of 600s.  Breach of the king's dwelling [breaking and entering] shall be  120s.; an archbishop's, 90s.; any other bishop's, and an  ealdorman's, 60s.;. a 1200s. wergeld man's, 30s.; a 600s.  wergeld man's, 15s.; and a ceorl's 5s.    If any one plot against the king's life, of himself, or by  harbouring of exiles, or of his men; let him be liable with his  life and in all that he has; or let him prove himself according  to his lord's wer.    If any one with a band or gang of men slays an unoffending man,  let him who acknowledges the death-blow pay wer and wite. If the  slain man had a wergeld of  200s, let every one who was of the  gang pay 30s. as gang-bot. If he had a wergeld of 600s., let  every one pay 60s. as gang-bot.  If he had  a wergeld of 1200s.,  let every one pay 120s. If a gang does this, and afterwards  denies it on oath, let them all be accused, and let them then  all pay the wer in common; and all, one wite, such as shall  belong to the wer.    If any one lends his weapon to another so he may kill some one  with it, they may join together if they will in the wer. If they  will not join together, let him who lent the weapon pay of the  wer a third part, and of the wite a third part.    With his lord a man may fight free of liability for homicide, if  any one attack the lord: thus may the lord fight for his man.  Likewise, a man may fight with his born kinsman, if a man attack  him wrongfully, except against his lord. And a man may fight  free of liability for homicide, if he finds another with his  lawful wife, within closed doors, or under one covering, or with  his lawfully-born daughter, or with his lawfully-born sister, or  with his mother, who was given to his father as his lawful wife.  If a man knows his foe is sitting at his home, he may not fight  with him before he demands justice of him. If he has such power  that he can beset his foe, and besiege him within, let him keep  him within for seven days, and not attack him if he will remains  within. And, then, after seven days, if he surrenders, and gives  up his weapons, let him be kept safe for thirty days, and let  notice of him be given to his kinsmen and his friends. But if he  does not have sufficient power to besiege him within, let him  ride to the ealdorman, and beg aid of him. If he will not aid  him, let him ride to the king before he fights. In like manner  also, if a man come upon his foe, and he did not know  beforehand that he was staying at his home; if he is willing to  give up his weapons, let him be kept for thirty days, and let  notice of him be given to his friends; if he will not give up  his weapons, then he may attack him. If he is willing to  surrender, and to give up his weapons, and any one after that  attack him, let him pay as well wer as wound, as he may do, and  wite, and let him have forfeited his compensation to his kin.  Every church shall have this peace: if a fugitive flee to one  for sanctuary, no one may drag him out for seven days. If he is  willing to give up his weapons to his foes, let him stay thirty  days, and then let notice of him be given to his kinsmen. If any  man confess in church any offences which had not been before  revealed, let him be half forgiven.    If a man from one holdgetael wishs to seek a lord in another  holdgetael, let him do it with the knowledge of the ealdorman  whom he before followed in his shire. If he does it without his  knowledge, let him who treats him as his man pay 120s. as wite,  one-half to the king in the shire where he before followed and  one-half in that into which he comes. If he has done anything  wrong where he was before, let him make bot for it who has there  received him as his man; and to the king 120s. as wite.    \"If any one steals so that his wife and children don't know it,  he shall pay 60 shillings as wite. But if he steals with the  knowledge of all his household, they shall all go into slavery.  A boy of ten years may be privy to a theft.\"    \"If one who takes a thief, or holds him for the person who took  him, lets the thief go, or conceals the theft, he shall pay for  the thief according to his wer. If he is an eorldormen, he shall  forfeit his shire, unless the king is willing to be merciful to  him.\"    If any one steal in a church, let him pay the lawful penalty and  the wite,  and let the hand be struck off with which he did it.  If he will redeem the hand, and that be allowed him, let him pay  as may belong to his wer.    If a man slanders another, the penalty is no lighter thing than  that his tongue be cut out; which must not be redeemed at any  cheaper rate than it is estimated at according to his wer.    If one deceives an unbetrothed woman and sleep with her, he must  pay for her and have her afterwards to wife. But if her father not  approve, he should pay money according to her dowry.    \"If a man seize hold of the breast of a ceorlish woman, let him  make bot to her with 5 shillings. If he throw her down and do not  lie with her, let him make bot with 10 shillings. If he lie with  her, let him make bot with 60 shillings. If another man had before  lain with her, then let the bot be half that. ... If this befall a  woman more nobly born, let the bot increase according to the wer.\"    \"If any one, with libidinous intent, seize a nun either by her  raiment or by her breast without her leave, let the bot be  twofold, as we have before ordained concerning a laywoman.\"    \"If a man commit a rape upon a ceorl's female slave, he must pay  bot to the ceorl of 5 shillings and a wite [fine to the King] of  60 shillings. If a male theow rape a female theow, let him make  bot with his testicles.\"    For the first dog bite, the owner pays 6 shillings, for the  second, 12 shillings, for the third, 30 shillings.    An ox which gores someone to death shall be stoned.    If one steals or slays another's ox, he must give two oxen for it.    The man who has land left to him by his kindred must not give it  away from his kindred, if there is a writing or witness that  such was forbidden by those men who at first acquired it, and by  those who gave it to him; and then let that be declared in the  presence of the king and of the bishop, before his kinsmen.                                 - Judicial Procedure -    Cases were held at monthly meetings of the hundred court. The king  or one of his reeves, conducted the trial by compurgation.    In compurgation, the one complaining, called the \"plaintiff\", and  the one defending, called the \"defendant\", each told their story  and put his hand on the Bible and swore \"By God this oath is clean  and true\". A slip or a stammer would mean he lost the case.  Otherwise, community members would stand up to swear on behalf of  the plaintiff or the defendant as to their reputation for  veracity. The value of a man's oath was commensurate with his  value or wergeld. A man's brothers were usually his compurgators.  If these \"compurgators\" were too few, usually twelve in number, or  recited poorly, their party lost. If this process was  inconclusive, the parties could bring witnesses to declare such  knowledge as they had as neighbors. These witnesses, male and  female, swore to"]]]
