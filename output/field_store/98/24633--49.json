Placing the stool beneath the opening,  he got on to it, and lifted himself through the trap-door, when he found  himself in a loft, a parchment nailed to the wall facing him, and on  the parchment was written, 'This has been prepared, for your end was  foreseen, and your foolish father buried three chests of gold one foot  below the surface of the floor of the hut. Go and take it and buy back  your estate: marry, and beget an heir.'    \"'Good God! is this a ghastly joke?' said the prodigal. But the words  looked truthful; so he tore down the parchment, dropped through the  trap-door, shut it, and readjusted the rope. He left the hut and  borrowed a pick and shovel, and returning to the hut, he began to dig,  and found one chest full of gold. When he made this discovery he closed  the chest, filled in the hole, and spread leaves over the spot. He then  ran off to his father's best friend, and told him of his good luck. They  then called in two other friends, and consulted together how the old  lord's wish was best to be carried out. 'I'll tell you,' said his  father's oldest friend. 'Mr. John o' Scales gives a great dinner party  once a month, and three of us here are invited as usual. You must come  in in the middle of dinner in your ordinary beggar clothes and beg  humbly for some food, when he will give orders to have you turned out.  Then you must begin to call him a liar and a thief, and accuse him of  robbing your father and yourself of your inheritance. You'll see he'll  get angry, and offer to let you have it back.'    \"So the prodigal dug up the chests, and carted the money away in canvas  bags, storing it at his friend's house.\"            *       *       *       *       *    \"When the night of the dinner party came, the prodigal drove up to the  castle in a cart filled with canvas bags. Jumping off his seat by the  driver, he went into the feast in his beggar's clothes, and going up to  the host, he begged humbly for some food.    \"'Go from this house! What business have you here?' asked the host.    \"Most of the gentlemen and ladies began to frown upon him, and murmur  against him, as he walked to the lady of the house and begged her to  give him some food, but she replied:    \"'Oh, thou spendthrift! thou fool of fools! if all fools were hanged, as  they ought to be, you'd be the first.'    \"Then the beggar's countenance changed, a deep flush of anger overspread  his features, and drawing himself up to his full height, he said, with  solemn voice, addressing the host:    \"'Thou hast robbed my father all the days of his life, and thou hast  robbed the orphan. May the curse of God be upon you!'    \"The host grew furious; then he looked ashamed, and shouted angrily:    \"'Bring me L40,000, and you shall have your estate back. I never robbed  you, but you lost your inheritance by your own follies.'    \"'Gentlemen,' said the beggar, 'I take you all to witness that this  thief says I can have my estate back for L40,000.'    \"The people murmured, and the three friends said: 'We are witnesses.'    \"The beggar ran out into the night, and returned with a man laden with  sacks, and they began to count out L40,000 upon a side-table, where a  haunch of venison still smoked.    \"When they had counted out the money, the beggar said:    \"'There is your L40,000; sign this receipt.'    \"The amazed factor drew back, when the three friends said:    \"'You must sign; you are a gentleman of your word, of course.'    \"Mechanically John o' Scales signed the paper.    \"'And now,' said the former beggar, 'leave my house at once, with your  wife--you coward! you cur! You robbed my father, and then cheated me  when I was a spendthrift. Begone, and may your name be accursed in the  land!'    \"And the son turned all out except his three friends.    \"In a few months he married the daughter of one of his friends; but  he never gambled again, only entertaining his three friends and their  families, who came and went as they liked.    \"And from that day John o' Scales was called John o' Groats.\"          EVA'S LUCK.    As black-eyed, black-haired Eva Sauvet was walking one day in Jersey she  saw a lozenge-marked snake, whereupon she ran away frightened.    When she got home and told her mother, the old woman said:    \"Well, child, next time you see the snake give it your handkerchief.\"    The next day Eva went out with beating heart, and ere long she saw  the snake come gliding out from the bushes, so she threw down her  handkerchief, for she was too frightened to hand it to the snake.    The snake's eyes gleamed and twinkled, and taking the handkerchief into  his fangs, he made off to an old ruin, whither Eva followed.    But when they got to the ruin the snake disappeared, and Eva ran home to  tell her mother.    Next day, Pere Sauvet and some men went to the ruin, where Eva showed  the hole where the snake had disappeared.    Old Pere Sauvet lit a fire, and smoked the snake out, killing it with a  stick as it glided over the stones.    After that they dug out the hole, when they found the handkerchief.  Digging still further along, they came upon a hollow place, at the  bottom of which they found a lot of gold.          THE FISHERMEN OF SHETLAND.    There was a snug little cove in one of the Shetland Islands. At the  head of the cove stood a fishing hamlet, containing some twenty huts. In  these huts lived the fisher-folk, ruled by one man--the chief--who was  the father of two beautiful daughters.    Now these fishermen for some years had been very lucky, for a fairy  queen and her fairies had settled there, and she had given her power  over to a merman, who was the chief of a large family of mermaids. The  fairy queen had made the merman a belt of sea-weed, which he always wore  round his body. The merman used to turn the water red, green, and white,  at noon each day, so that the fishermen knew that if they cast their  nets into the coloured waters they would make good hauls.    Amongst these fishermen were two brave brothers, who courted the chief's  daughters, but the old man would not let them get married until they  became rich men.    Whenever the fishermen went off in the boats the merman was used to sit  on a rock, and watch them fishing.    Close by the hamlet was a great wood, in which lived a wicked old witch  and a dwarf.    Now this witch wished to get possession of the merman's belt, and so  gain the fairy's power. Telling her scheme to the dwarf, she said to  him:    \"Now you must trap the merman when he is sitting on the rocks watching  the fishing fleet. But I must change you into a bee, when you must  suck of the juice in this magic basin, then fly off and alight on the  merman's head, when he will fall asleep.\"    So the dwarf agreed, and it happened as she had said; and the merman  fell asleep, and the dwarf stole the belt and brought it to the witch.    \"Now you must wear the belt,\" said the witch to the dwarf, \"and you will  have the power and the fairy will lose her power.\"    They then translated the sleeping merman to the forest and laid him  before the hut, when the witch got a copper vessel, saying:    \"We must bury him in this.\"    Then she got the magic pot, and told the dwarf to take a ladleful of  the fluid in the pot, and pour it over the merman, which he did, and  immediately the merman turned into smoke, that settled in the copper  vessel. Then they sealed the copper vessel tightly.    \"Now take this vessel, and heave it into the sea fifty miles from the  land,\" said the witch, and the dwarf did as he was bid.    \"Now we'll starve those old fishermen out this winter,\" said the witch;  and it happened as she had said--they could catch nothing.    In the spring the queen fairy came to one of the young fishermen who was  courting one of the chief's daughters, and said:    \"You must venture for the sake of your love, and for the lives of the  fishermen, or you will all starve--but I will be with you. Will you run  the risk?\"    \"I will,\" said the brave fisherman.    \"Well, the dwarf has got my belt, he stole it from the merman, and so I  have lost power over the world for twelve months and a day; but if you  get back the belt I can settle the witch; if not, you will all starve  and catch no fish.\"    So the bold fisherman agreed to try.    \"Now I must transform you into a bear, and you'll have to watch the  witch and the dwarf, and take your chance of getting the belt; and you  must watch where he hides his treasure, for he is using the belt as a  means to get gold, which he hides in a cave.\"    And so the sailor was turned into a bear, and he went to the wood and  watched the dwarf, and saw that he hid his treasure in a cave in some  crags.    The bear had been given the power of making himself invisible, by  sitting on his haunches and rubbing his ears with his paws.    One night, when it was very boisterous, the bear felt like going to see  his sweetheart. So he went, and knocked at the door. The girl opened the  door, and shrieked when she saw the bear.    \"Oh, let him in,\" said her old mother.    So the bear came in and asked for shelter from the storm, for he could  speak.    And he went and sat by the fire, and asked his sweetheart to brush the  snow from his coat, which she did.    \"I won't do you any harm,\" he said; \"let me sleep by the fire.\"    He came again the next night, and they gave him some gruel, and played  with him; for he was just like a dog.    So he came every night until the springtime, when, one morning, as he  was going away, he said:    \"You mustn't expect me any more. Spring has come, and the snows have  melted. I can't come again till the summer is over.\"    So he returned to the wood and watched the dwarf, but he could never  catch him without his belt, until one day he saw him fishing for salmon  without the belt, and at the same time his sweetheart and her sister  came by picking "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#8)"],[1," rushed in.    The gentlemen had heard, couldn't explain the cry, and were quite ready  to protect the pretty creatures who clustered about them like frightened  fawns. John speedily appeared, looking rather wild, and as eager to tell  his tale as they to listen.    \"It's Patty, one of the maids, miss, in a fit. She went up to the north  gallery to see that the fires was right, for it takes a power of wood to  warm the gallery even enough for dancing, as you know, miss. Well, it  was dark, for the fires was low and her candle went out as she whisked  open the door, being flurried, as the maids always is when they go in  there. Halfway down the gallery she says she heard a rustling, and  stopped. She's the pluckiest of 'em all, and she called out, 'I see  you!' thinking it was some of us trying to fright her. Nothing answered,  and she went on a bit, when suddenly the fire flared up one flash, and  there right before her was the ghost.\"    \"Don't be foolish, John. Tell us what it was,\" said Octavia sharply,  though her face whitened and her heart sank as the last word passed the  man's lips.    \"It was a tall, black figger, miss, with a dead-white face and a black  hood. She see it plain, and turned to go away, but she hadn't gone a  dozen steps when there it was again before her, the same tall, dark  thing with the dead-white face looking out from the black hood. It  lifted its arm as if to hold her, but she gave a spring and dreadful  screech, and ran to Mrs. Benson's room, where she dropped in a fit.\"    \"How absurd to be frightened by the shadows of the figures in armor that  stand along the gallery!\" said Rose, boldly enough, though she would  have declined entering the gallery without a light.    \"Nay, I don't wonder, it's a ghostly place at night. How is the  poor thing?\" asked Blanche, still hanging on the major's arm in her  best attitude.    \"If Mamma knows nothing of it, tell Mrs. Benson to keep it from her,  please. She is not well, and such things annoy her very much,\" said  Octavia, adding as the man turned away, \"Did anyone look in the gallery  after Patty told her tale?\"    \"No, miss. I'll go and do it myself; I'm not afraid of man, ghost, or  devil, saving your presence, ladies,\" replied John.    \"Where is Sir Jasper?\" suddenly asked the major.    \"Here I am. What a deuce of a noise someone has been making. It  disturbed a capital dream. Why, Tavie, what is it?\" And Sir Jasper came  out of the library with a sleepy face and tumbled hair.    They told him the story, whereat he laughed heartily, and said the maids  were a foolish set to be scared by a shadow. While he still laughed and  joked, Mrs. Snowdon entered, looking alarmed, and anxious to know the  cause of the confusion.    \"How interesting! I never knew you kept a ghost. Tell me all about it,  Sir Jasper, and soothe our nerves by satisfying our curiosity,\" she said  in her half-persuasive, half-commanding way, as she seated herself on  Lady Treherne's sacred sofa.    \"There's not much to tell, except that this place used to be an abbey,  in fact as well as in name. An ancestor founded it, and for years the  monks led a jolly life here, as one may see, for the cellar is twice as  large as the chapel, and much better preserved. But another ancestor, a  gay and gallant baron, took a fancy to the site for his castle, and, in  spite of prayers, anathemas, and excommunication, he turned the poor  fellows out, pulled down the abbey, and built this fine old place. Abbot  Boniface, as he left his abbey, uttered a heavy curse on all who should  live here, and vowed to haunt us till the last Treherne vanished from  the face of the earth. With this amiable threat the old party left Baron  Roland to his doom, and died as soon as he could in order to begin his  cheerful mission.\"    \"Did he haunt the place?\" asked Blanche eagerly.    \"Yes, most faithfully from that time to this. Some say many of the monks  still glide about the older parts of the abbey, for Roland spared the  chapel and the north gallery which joined it to the modern building.  Poor fellows, they are welcome, and once a year they shall have a chance  to warm their ghostly selves by the great fires always kindled at  Christmas in the gallery.\"    \"Mrs. Benson once told me that when the ghost walked, it was a sure sign  of a coming death in the family. Is that true?\" asked Rose, whose  curiosity was excited by the expression of Octavia's face, and a certain  uneasiness in Sir Jasper's manner in spite of his merry mood.    \"There is a stupid superstition of that sort in the family, but no one  except the servants believes it, of course. In times of illness some  silly maid or croaking old woman can easily fancy they see a phantom,  and, if death comes, they are sure of the ghostly warning. Benson saw  it before my father died, and old Roger, the night my uncle was seized  with apoplexy. Patty will never be made to believe that this warning  does not forebode the death of Maurice or myself, for the gallant  spirit leaves the ladies of our house to depart in peace. How does it  strike you, Cousin?\"    Turning as he spoke, Sir Jasper glanced at Treherne, who had entered  while he spoke.    \"I am quite skeptical and indifferent to the whole affair, but I agree  with Octavia that it is best to say nothing to my aunt if she is  ignorant of the matter. Her rooms are a long way off, and perhaps she  did not hear the confusion.\"    \"You seem to hear everything; you were not with us when I said that.\"  And Octavia looked up with an air of surprise.    Smiling significantly, Treherne answered, \"I hear, see, and understand  many things that escape others. Jasper, allow me to advise you to smooth  the hair which your sleep has disarranged. Mrs. Snowdon, permit me. This  rich velvet catches the least speck.\" And with his handkerchief he  delicately brushed away several streaks of white dust which clung to the  lady's skirt.    Sir Jasper turned hastily on his heel and went to remake his toilet;  Mrs. Snowdon bit her lip, but thanked Treherne sweetly and begged him to  fasten her glove. As he did so, she said softly, \"Be more careful next  time. Octavia has keen eyes, and the major may prove inconvenient.\"    \"I have no fear that _you_ will,\" he whispered back, with a  malicious glance.    Here the entrance of my lady put an end to the ghostly episode, for it  was evident that she knew nothing of it. Octavia slipped away to  question John, and learn that no sign of a phantom was to be seen.  Treherne devoted himself to Mrs. Snowdon, and the major entertained my  lady, while Sir Jasper and the girls chatted apart.    It was Christmas Eve, and a dance in the great gallery was the yearly  festival at the abbey. All had been eager for it, but the maid's story  seemed to have lessened their enthusiasm, though no one would own it.  This annoyed Sir Jasper, and he exerted himself to clear the atmosphere  by affecting gaiety he did not feel. The moment the gentlemen came in  after dinner he whispered to his mother, who rose, asked the general for  his arm, and led the way to the north gallery, whence the sound of music  now proceeded. The rest followed in a merry procession, even Treherne,  for two footmen carried him up the great stairway, chair and all.    Nothing could look less ghostly now than the haunted gallery. Fires  roared up a wide chimney at either end, long rows of figures clad in  armor stood on each side, one mailed hand grasping a lance, the other  bearing a lighted candle, a device of Sir Jasper's. Narrow windows  pierced in the thick walls let in gleams of wintry moonlight; ivy,  holly, and evergreen glistened in the ruddy glow of mingled firelight  and candle shine. From the arched stone roof hung tattered banners, and  in the midst depended a great bunch of mistletoe. Red-cushioned seats  stood in recessed window nooks, and from behind a high-covered screen of  oak sounded the blithe air of Sir Roger de Coverley.    With the utmost gravity and stateliness my lady and the general led off  the dance, for, according to the good old fashion, the men and maids in  their best array joined the gentlefolk and danced with their betters in  a high state of pride and bashfulness. Sir Jasper twirled the old  housekeeper till her head spun around and around and her decorous skirts  rustled stormily; Mrs. Snowdon captivated the gray-haired butler by her  condescension; and John was made a proud man by the hand of his young  mistress. The major came out strong among the pretty maids, and Rose  danced the footmen out of breath long before the music paused.    The merriment increased from that moment, and when the general  surprised my lady by gallantly saluting her as she unconsciously stood  under the mistletoe, the applause was immense. Everyone followed the  old gentleman's example as fast as opportunities occurred, and the  young ladies soon had as fine a color as the housemaids. More dancing,  games, songs, and all manner of festival devices filled the evening,  yet under cover of the gaiety more than one little scene was enacted  that night, and in an hour of seeming frivolity the current of several  lives was changed.    By a skillful maneuver Annon led Octavia to an isolated recess, as if to  rest after a brisk game, and, taking advantage of the auspicious hour,  pleaded his suit. She heard him patiently and, when he paused, said  slowly, yet decidedly, and with no sign of maiden hesitation, \"Thanks  for the honor you do me, but I cannot accept it, for I do not love you.  I think I never can.\"    \"Have you tried?\" he asked eagerly.    \"Yes, indeed I have. I like you as a friend, but no more. I know Mamma  desires it, that Jasper hopes for it, and I try to please them, but love  will not be forced, so what can I do?\" And she smiled in spite of  herself at her own blunt simplicity.    \"No, but it can be cherished, strengthened, and in time won, with  patience and devotion. Let me try, Octavia; it"]]]
