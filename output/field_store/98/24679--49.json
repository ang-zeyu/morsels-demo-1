Having received the two plans, the convention then went, on May 30,  into a committee of the whole to consider the fifteen propositions in  the Virginia plan _seriatim_. They wisely concluded to determine  abstract ideas first and concrete forms later. Apparently for the time  being little attention was paid to Pinckney's plan, and this may have  been due to the hostile attitude of the older members of the convention  to the presumption of his youth.    Then ensued a very remarkable debate on the immediate propositions and  the principles of government which underlay them, which lasted for two  weeks. On June 13 the committee rose. Even the fragments of this debate,  which may well have been one of the most notable in history, indicate  the care with which the members had studied governments of ancient and  modern times. There were many points of difference, but chief of them,  which nearly resulted in the collapse of the convention, was the  inevitable difficulty which always arises in the formation of a league  of States or an association of nations between the great and the little  States.    The five larger States had a population that was nearly twice as great  as the remaining eight States. Thus Virginia's population was nearly  ten-fold as great as Georgia. Moreover, the States differed greatly in  their material wealth and power. Nevertheless, all of them entered the  convention as independent sovereign nations, and the smaller nations  contended that the equality in suffrage and political power which  prevailed in the convention (in which each State, large or small, voted  as a unit), should and must be preserved in the future government. To  this the larger States were quite unwilling to yield, and when the  committee rose they reported, in substance, the Virginia plan, with the  proviso that representation in the proposed double-chambered Congress  should be \"according to some equitable ratio of representation.\"    On June 15 the small States presented their draft, which was afterwards  known as the New Jersey plan, because it was introduced by Mr. Patterson  of that State. It only contemplated an amendment to the existing  Constitution and an amplification of the powers of the impotent  Confederation. Its chief advance over the existing government was that  it provided for a federal executive and a federal judiciary, but  otherwise the government remained a mere league of States, in which the  central government could generally act only by the vote of nine States,  and in which their power was exhausted when they requested the States to  enforce the decrees. Its chief advance over the Articles of  Confederation, in addition to the creation of an executive, was an  assertion that the acts of Congress \"shall be the supreme law of the  respective States ... and that the judiciary of the several States shall  be bound thereby in their decisions,\" and that \"if any State or any  body of men in any State shall oppose or prevent the carrying into  execution of such acts or treaties the federal executive shall be  authorized to call forth the power of the confederated States ... to  enforce and compel obedience to such acts or an observance of such  treaties.\"    While this was some advance toward a truly national government, it yet  left the national executive dependent upon the constituent States, for  if they failed to respond to the call above stated the national  government had no direct power over their citizens.    The New Jersey plan precipitated a crisis, and thereafter, and for many  days, the argument proceeded, only to increase in bitterness.    On June 18 Alexander Hamilton, who agreed with no one else, addressed  the convention for the first time. He spoke for five hours and reviewed  exhaustively the Virginia and New Jersey plans, and possibly the  Pinckney draft. Even the fragment of the speech, as taken in long-hand  by Madison, shows that it was a masterly argument. He stated his belief  \"that the British Government was the best in the world and that he  doubted much whether anything short of it would do in America.\" He  praised the British Constitution, quoting Monsieur Necker as saying that  \"it was the only government in the world which unites government  strength with individual security.\" He analysed and explained your  Constitution as it then was and advocated an elective monarchy in form  though not in name. It is true that he called the executive a \"governor\"  and not a king, but the governor, so-called, was to serve for life and  was given not only \"a negative on all laws about to be passed,\" but even  the execution of all duly enacted laws was in his discretion. The  governor, with the consent of the Senate, was to make war, conclude all  treaties, make all appointments, pardon all offences, with the full  power through his negative of saying what laws should be passed and  which enforced. Hamilton's governor would have been not dissimilar to  Louis XIV, and could have said with him, \"_L'etat, c'est moi_!\" The  Senate also served for life, and the only concession which Hamilton made  to democracy was an elective house of representatives. Thinly veiled,  his plan contemplated an elective king with greater powers than those of  George III, an imitation House of Lords and a popular House of Commons  with a limited tenure.    Hamilton's plan was never taken seriously and, so far as the records  show, was never afterwards considered. His admirers have given great  praise to his work in the federal convention. His real contribution lay  in the fact that when the Constitution was finally drafted and offered  to the people, while he regarded it as a \"wretched makeshift,\" to use  his own expression, yet he was broad and patriotic enough to surrender  his own views and advocate the adoption of the Constitution. In so  doing, he fought a valorous fight, secured the acquiescence of the State  of New York, and without its ratification the Constitution would never  have been adopted. Hamilton later thought better of the Constitution,  and its successful beginning is due in large measure to his genius for  constructive administration.    As the debate proceeded, the crisis precipitated by the seemingly  insoluble differences between the great and little States became more  acute. The smaller States contended that the convention was  transgressing its powers, and they demanded that the credentials of the  various members be read. In this there was technical accuracy, for the  delegates had been appointed to revise the Articles of Confederation and  not to adopt a new Constitution. A majority of the convention, however,  insisted upon the convention proceeding with the consideration of a new  Constitution, and their views prevailed. It speaks well for the honour  of the delegates that although their differences became so acute as to  lead at times to bitter expressions, neither side divulged them to the  outside public. The smaller States could easily have ended the  convention by an appeal to public opinion, which was not then prepared  for a \"consolidated union,\" but they were loyal enough to fight out  their quarrels within the walls of the convention hall.    At times the debate became bitter in the extreme. James Wilson, a  delegate of Pennsylvania and a Scotchman by birth and education, turning  to the representatives of the little States, passionately said:        \"Will you abandon a country to which you are bound by so many strong      and enduring ties? Should the event happen, it will neither stagger      my sentiments nor duty. If the minority of the people refuse to      coalesce with the majority on just and proper principles, if a      separation must take place, it could never happen on better      grounds.\"    He referred to the demand of the larger States that representation  should be proportioned to the population. To this Bedford, of Delaware,  as heatedly replied;        \"We have been told with a dictatorial air that this is the last      moment for a fair trial in favour of good government. It will be the      last, indeed, if the propositions reported by the committee go forth      to the people. The large States dare not dissolve the convention. If      they do, the small ones will find some foreign ally of more honour      and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them justice.\"    Finally, the smaller States gave their ultimatum to the larger States  that unless representation in both branches of the proposed legislature  should be on the basis of equality--each State, whether large or small,  having one vote--they would forthwith leave the convention. An  eye-witness says that, at that moment, Washington, who was in the chair,  gave old Doctor Franklin a significant look. Franklin arose and moved an  adjournment for forty-eight hours, with the understanding that the  delegates should confer with those with whom they disagreed rather than  with those with whom they agreed.    A recess was taken, and when the convention re-convened on July 2, a  vote was taken as to equality of representation in the Senate and  resulted in a tie vote. It was then decided to appoint a committee of  eleven, one from each State, to consider the question, and this  committee reported three days later, on July 5, in favour of  proportionate representation in the House and equal representation in  the Senate. This suggestion, which finally saved the situation, was due  to that wise old utilitarian philosopher, Franklin. Again, a vehement  and passionate debate followed. Vague references were made to the sword  as the only method of solving the difference.    On July 9 the committee again reported, maintaining the principle of  their recommendation, while modifying its details, and the debate then  turned upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10066"],[0,"Gunman's Reckoning (#9)"],[1,"was not single-handed. He  belongs to a wild crew, led by a mysterious fellow of whom no one knows  very much, a deadly fighter, it is said, and a keen organizer and  handler of men. Red-haired, wild, smooth. A bundle of contradictions.  They call him Lord Nick because he has the pride of a nobleman and the  cunning of the devil. He has gathered a few chosen spirits and cool  fighters--the Pedlar, Joe Rix, Harry Masters--all celebrated names in  the cattle country.    \"They worship Lord Nick partly because he is a genius of crime and  partly because he understands how to guide them so that they may rob and  even kill with impunity. His peculiarity is his ability to keep within  the bounds of the law. If he commits a robbery he always first  establishes marvelous alibis and throws the blame toward someone else;  if it is the case of a killing, it is always the other man who is the  aggressor. He has been before a jury half a dozen times, but the devil  knows the law and pleads his own case with a tongue that twists the  hearts out of the stupid jurors. You see? No common man. And this is the  leader of the group of which Lester is one of the most debased members.  He had no sooner been shot than Lord Nick himself appeared. He had his  followers with him. He saw Jack Landis, threatened him with death, and  made Jack swear that he would hand over half of the profits of the mines  to the gang--of which, I suppose, Lester gets his due proportion. At the  same time, Lord Nick attempted to persuade Jack that I, his adopted  father, you might say, was really in the wrong, and that I had stolen  the claims from this wretched Lester!\"    He waved this disgusting accusation into a mist and laughed with hateful  softness.    \"The result is this: Jack Landis draws a vast revenue from the mines.  Half of it he turns over to Lord Nick, and Lord Nick in return gives him  absolute freedom and backing in the camp, where he is, and probably will  continue the dominant factor. As for the other half, Landis spends it on  this woman with whom he has become infatuated. And not a penny comes  through to me!\"    Colonel Macon leaned back in his chair and his eyes became fixed upon a  great distance. He smiled, and the blood turned cold in the veins of  Donnegan.    \"Of course this adventuress, this Nelly Lebrun, plays hand in glove with  Lord Nick and his troupe; unquestionably she shares her spoils, so that  nine-tenths of the revenue from the mines is really flowing back through  the hands of Lord Nick and Jack Landis has become a silly figurehead. He  struts about the streets of The Corner as a great mine owner, and with  the power of Lord Nick behind him, not one of the people of the gambling  houses and dance halls dares cross him. So that Jack has come to  consider himself a great man. Is it clear?\"    Donnegan had not yet drawn his gaze entirely back from the distance.    \"This is the possible solution,\" went on the colonel. \"Jack Landis must  be drawn away from the influence of this Nelly Lebrun. He must be  brought back to us and shown his folly both as regards the adventuress  and Lord Nick; for so long as Nelly has a hold on him, just so long  Lord Nick will have his hand in Jack's pocket. You see how beautifully  their plans and their work dovetail? How, therefore, am I to draw him  from Nelly? There is only one way: send my daughter to the camp--send  Lou to The Corner and let one glimpse of her beauty turn the shabby  prettiness of this woman to a shadow! Lou is my last hope!\"    At this Donnegan wakened. His sneer was not a pleasant thing to see.    \"Send her to a new mining camp. Colonel Macon, you have the gambling  spirit; you are willing to take great chances!\"    \"So! So!\" murmured the colonel, a little taken aback. \"But I should  never send her except with an adequate protector.\"    \"An adequate protector even against these celebrated gunmen who run the  camp as you have already admitted?\"    \"An adequate protector--you are the man!\"    Donnegan shivered.    \"I? I take your daughter to the camp and play her against Nelly Lebrun  to win back Jack Landis? Is that the scheme?\"    \"It is.\"    \"Ah,\" murmured Donnegan. And he got up and began to walk the room,  white-faced; the colonel watched him in a silent agony of anxiety.    \"She truly loves this Landis?\" asked Donnegan, swallowing.    \"A love that has grown out of their long intimacy together since they  were children.\"    \"Bah! Calf love! Let the fellow go and she will forget him. Hearts are  not broken in these days by disappointments in love affairs.\"    The colonel writhed in his chair.    \"But Lou--you do not know her heart!\" he suggested. \"If you looked  closely at her you would have seen that she is pale. She does not  suspect the truth, but I think she is wasting away because Jack hasn't  written for weeks.\"    He saw Donnegan wince under the whip.    \"It is true,\" murmured the wanderer. \"She is not like others, heaven  knows!\" He turned. \"And what if I fail to bring over Jack Landis with  the sight of Lou?\"    The colonel relaxed; the great crisis was past and Donnegan would  undertake the journey.    \"In that case, my dear lad, there is an expedient so simple that you  astonish me by not perceiving it. If there is no way to wean Landis away  from the woman, then get him alone and shoot him through the heart. In  that way you remove from the life of Lou a man unworthy of her and you  also make the mines come to the heir of Jack Landis--namely, myself. And  in the latter case, Mr. Donnegan, be sure--oh, be sure that I should not  forget who brought the mines into my hands!\"          10      Fifty miles over any sort of going is a stiff march. Fifty miles uphill  and down and mostly over districts where there was only a rough cow path  in lieu of a road made a prodigious day's work; and certainly it was an  almost incredible feat for one who professed to hate work with a  consuming passion and who had looked upon an eight-mile jaunt the night  before as an insuperable burden. Yet such was the distance which  Donnegan had covered, and now he drove the pack mule out on the shoulder  of the hill in full view of The Corner with the triangle of the Young  Muddy and Christobel Rivers embracing the little town. Even the gaunt,  leggy mule was tired to the dropping point, and the tough buckskin which  trailed up behind went with downward head. When Louise Macon turned to  him, he had reached the point where he swung his head around first and  then grudgingly followed the movement with his body. The girl was tired,  also, in spite of the fact that she had covered every inch of the  distance in the saddle. There was that violet shade of weariness under  her eyes and her shoulders slumped forward. Only Donnegan, the hater of  labor, was fresh.    They had started in the first dusk of the coming day; it was now the  yellow time of the slant afternoon sunlight; between these two points  there had been a body of steady plodding. The girl had looked askance at  that gaunt form of Donnegan's when they began; but before three hours,  seeing that the spring never left his step nor the swinging rhythm his  stride, she began to wonder. This afternoon, nothing he did could have  surprised her. From the moment he entered the house the night before he  had been a mystery. Till her death day she would not forget the fire  with which he had stared up at her from the foot of the stairs. But when  he came out of her father's room--not cowed and whipped as most men left  it--he had looked at her with a veiled glance, and since that moment  there had always been a mist of indifference over his eyes when he  looked at her.    In the beginning of that day's march all she knew was that her father  trusted her to this stranger, Donnegan, to take her to The Corner, where  he was to find Jack Landis and bring Jack back to his old allegiance and  find what he was doing with his time and his money. It was a quite  natural proceeding, for Jack was a wild sort, and he was probably  gambling away all the gold that was dug in his mines. It was perfectly  natural throughout, except that she should have been trusted so entirely  to a stranger. That was a remarkable thing, but, then, her father was a  remarkable man, and it was not the first time that his actions had been  inscrutable, whether concerning her or the affairs of other people. She  had heard men come into their house cursing Colonel Macon with death in  their faces; she had seen them sneak out after a soft-voiced interview  and never appear again. In her eyes, her father was invincible,  all-powerful. When she thought of superlatives, she thought of him. Her  conception of mystery was the smile of the colonel, and her conception  of tenderness was bounded by the gentle voice of the same man.  Therefore, it was entirely sufficient to her that the colonel had said:  \"Go, and trust everything to Donnegan. He has the power to command you  and you must obey--until Jack comes back to you.\"    That was odd, for, as far as she knew, Jack had never left her. But she  had early discarded any will to question her father. Curiosity was a  thing which the fat man hated above all else.    Therefore, it was really not strange to her that throughout the journey  her guide did not speak half a dozen words to her. Once or twice when  she attempted to open the conversation he had replied with crushing  monosyllables, and there was an end. For the rest, he was always  swinging down the trail ahead of her at a steady, unchanging, rapid  stride. Uphill and down it never varied. And so they came out upon the  shoulder of the hill and saw the storm center of The Corner. They were  in the hills behind the town; two miles would bring them into it. And  now Donnegan came back to her from the mule. He took off his hat and  shook the dust away; he brushed a hand across his face. He was still  unshaven. The red stubble made him hideous, and the dust and"]]]
