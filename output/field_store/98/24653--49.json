At the same time he reversed the  engine and the Red Cloud began pulling the touring car backward, also  lifting the rear wheels clear from the earth.    A startled cry from the occupants of the machine told Tom and his  friend that Andy and his cronies were aware something was wrong. A  moment later Andy, looking up, saw the airship hovering in the air  above him. Then he saw the rope fast to his auto. The airship was not  rising now, or the auto would have been turned over, but it was slowly  pulling it backward, in spite of the fact that the motor of the car was  still going.    \"Here! You let go of me!\" cried Andy. \"I'll have you arrested if you  damage my car.\"    \"Come up here and cut the rope,\" called Tom leaning over and looking  down. He could enjoy the bully's discomfiture.  As for Sam and Pete,  they were much frightened, and cowered down on the floor of the tonneau.    \"Maybe you'll shut me in the tank again and splash mud on me!\" shouted  Tom.    The rear wheels of the auto were lifted still higher from the ground,  as Mr. Sharp turned on a little more gas. Andy was not proof against  this.    \"Oh! oh!\" he cried. \"Please let me down, Tom. I'm awful sorry for what  I did! I'll never do it again! Please, please let me down! Don't! You'll  tip me over!\"    He had shut off his motor now, and was frantically clinging to the  steering wheel.    \"Do you admit that you're a sneak and a coward?\" asked Tom, \"rubbing it  in.\"    \"Yes, yes!  Oh, please let me down!\"    \"Shall we?\" asked Tom of Mr. Sharp.    \"Yes,\" replied the balloonist. \"We can afford to lose the rope and  anchor for the sake of turning the tables. Cut the cable.\"    Tom saw what was intended. Using a little hatchet, he severed the rope  with a single blow. With a crash that could be heard up in the air  where the Red Cloud hovered, the rear wheels of the auto dropped to the  ground. Then came two loud reports.    \"Both tires busted!\" commented Mr. Sharp dryly, and Tom, looking down,  saw the trio of lads ruefully contemplating the collapsed rubber of the  rear wheels. The tables had been effectually turned on Andy Foger. His  auto was disabled, and the airship, with a graceful sweep, mounted  higher and higher, continuing on its way to the coast.          Chapter Seven    Mr. Damon Will Go      \"Well, I guess they've had their lesson,\" remarked Tom, as he took an  observation through the telescope and saw Andy and his cronies hard at  work trying to repair the ruptured tires. \"That certainly was a corking  good trick.\"    \"Yes,\" admitted Mr. Sharp modestly. \"I once did something similar, only  it was a horse and wagon instead of an auto.  But let's try for another  speed record. The conditions are just right.\"    They arrived at the coast much sooner than they had dared to hope, the  Red Cloud proving herself a veritable wonder.    The remainder of that day, and part of the next, was spent in working  on the submarine.    \"We'll launch her day after to-morrow,\" declared Mr. Swift  enthusiastically. \"Then to see whether my calculations are right or  wrong.\"    \"It won't be your fault if it doesn't work,\" said his son.  \"You  certainly have done your best.\"    \"And so have you and Mr. Sharp and the others, for that matter. Well, I  have no doubt but that everything will be all right, Tom.\"    \"There!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp the next morning, as he was adjusting a  certain gage. \"I knew I'd forget something. That special brand of  lubricating oil. I meant to bring it from Shopton, and I didn't.\"    \"Maybe I can get it in Atlantis,\" suggested Tom, naming the coast city  nearest to them. \"I'll take a walk over. It isn't far.\"    \"Will you? I'll be glad to have you,\" resumed the balloonist. \"A gallon  will be all we'll need.\"    Tom was soon on his way. He had to walk, as the roads were too poor to  permit him to use the motor-cycle, and the airship attracted too much  attention to use on a short trip.  He was strolling along, when from  the other side of a row of sand dunes, that lined the uncertain road to  Atlantis, he heard some one speaking. At first the tones were not  distinct, but as the lad drew nearer to the voice he heard an  exclamation.    \"Bless my gold-headed cane! I believe I'm lost. He said it was out this  way somewhere, but I don't see anything of it.  If I had that Eradicate  Sampson here now I'd--bless my shoelaces I don't know what I would do  to him.\"    \"Mr. Damon! Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom. \"Is that you?\"    \"Me? Of course it's me! Who else would it be?\" answered the voice. \"But  who are you. Why, bless my liver! If it isn't Tom Swift!\" he cried.  \"Oh, but I'm glad to see you! I was afraid I was shipwrecked! Bless my  gaiters, how are you, anyhow? How is your father? How is Mr. Sharp, and  all the rest of them?\"    \"Pretty well. And you?\"    \"Me? Oh, I'm all right; only a trifle nervous. I called at your house  in Shopton yesterday, and Eradicate told me, as well as he could, where  you were located. I had nothing to do, so I thought I'd take a run down  here. But what's this I hear about you? Are you going on a voyage?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"In the air? May I go along again? I certainly enjoyed my other trip in  the Red Cloud. That is, all but the fire and being shot at. May I go?\"    \"We're going on a different sort of trip this time,\" said the youth.    \"Where?\"    \"Under water.\"    \"Under water?  Bless my sponge bath! You don't mean it!\"    \"Yes. Dad has completed the submarine he was working on when we were  off in the airship, and it will be launched the day after to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, that's so. I'd forgotten about it. He's going to try for the  Government prize, isn't he? But tell me more about it. Bless my  scarf-pin, but I'm glad I met you! Going into town, I take it. Well, I  just came from there, but I'll walk back with you. Do you think--is  there any possibility--that I could go with you? Of course, I don't  want to crowd you, but--\"    \"Oh, there'll be plenty of room,\" replied the young inventor. \"In fact,  more room than we had in the airship. We were talking only the other  day about the possibility of you going with us, but we didn't think  you'd risk it.\"    \"Risk it? Bless my liver! Of course I'll risk it! It can't be as bad  as sailing in the air. You can't fall, that's certain.\"    \"No; but maybe you can't rise,\" remarked Tom grimly.    \"Oh, we won't think of that. Of course, I'd like to go. I fully  expected to be killed in the Red Cloud, but as I wasn't. I'm ready to  take a chance in the water. On the whole, I think I prefer to be buried  at sea, anyhow. Now, then, will you take me?\"    \"I think I can safely promise,\" answered Tom with a smile at his  friend's enthusiasm.    The two were approaching the city, having walked along as they talked.  There were still some sand dunes near the road, and they kept on the  side of these, nearest the beach, where they could watch the breakers.    \"But you haven't told me where you are going,\" went on Mr. Damon, after  blessing a few dozen objects. \"Where do the Government trials take  place?\"    \"Well,\" replied the lad, \"to be frank with you, we have abandoned our  intention of trying for the Government prize.\"    \"Not going to try for it? Bless my slippers! Why not?  Isn't fifty  thousand dollars worth striving for? And, with the kind of a submarine  you say you have, you ought to be able to win.\"    \"Yes, probably we could win,\" admitted the young inventor, \"but we are  going to try for a better prize.\"    \"A better one? I don't understand.\"    \"Sunken treasure,\" explained Tom. \"There's a ship sunk off the coast of  Uruguay, with three hundred thousand dollars in gold bullion aboard.  Dad and I are going to try to recover that in our submarine. We're  going to start day after to-morrow, and, if you like, you may go along.\"    \"Go along! Of course I'll go along!\" cried the eccentric man. \"But I  never heard of such a thing. Sunken treasure!  Three hundred thousand  dollars in gold! My, what a lot of money! And to go after it in a  submarine! It's as good as a story!\"    \"Yes, we hope to recover all the treasure,\" said the lad.  \"We ought to  be able to claim at least half of it.\"    \"Bless my pocketbook!\" cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not hear him. At  that instant his attention was attracted by seeing two men emerge from  behind the sand dune near which he and Mr. Damon had halted  momentarily, when the youth explained about the treasure. The man  looked sharply at Tom.  A moment later the first man was joined by  another, and at the sight of him our hero could not repress an  exclamation of alarm. For the second man was none other than Addison  Berg.    The latter glanced quickly at Tom, and then, with a hasty word to his  companion, the two swung around and made off in the opposite direction  to that in which they had been walking.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Damon, seeing the young inventor was  strangely affected.    \"That--that man,\" stammered the lad.    \"You don't mean to tell me that was one the Happy Harry gang, do you?\"    \"No. But one, or both of those men, may prove to be worse.  That second  man was Addison Berg, and he's agent for a firm of submarine boat  builders who are rivals of dad's. Berg has been trying to find out why  we abandoned our intention of competing for the Government prize.\"    \"I hope you didn't tell him.\"    \"I didn't intend to,\" replied Tom, smiling grimly, \"but I'm afraid I  have, however. He certainly overheard what I said. I spoke too loud.  Yes, he must have heard me. That's why he hurried off so.\"    \"Possibly no harm is done. You didn't give the location of the sunken  ship.\"    \"No; but I guess from what I said it will be easy enough to find. Well,  if we're going to have a fight for the possession of that sunken gold,  I'm ready for it. The Advance is well equipped for a battle. I must  tell dad of this. It's my fault.\"    \"And partly mine, for asking you such leading questions in a public"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],[0,"The Prisoner of Zenda (#8)"],[1," out his hand.    \"In case,\" said he; and we shook hands heartily.    \"Damn your sentiment!\" growled Sapt. \"Come along.\"    He went, not to the door, but to a panel in the wall.    \"In the old King's time,\" said he, \"I knew this way well.\"    I followed him, and we walked, as I should estimate, near two hundred  yards along a narrow passage. Then we came to a stout oak door. Sapt  unlocked it. We passed through, and found ourselves in a quiet street  that ran along the back of the Palace gardens. A man was waiting for us  with two horses. One was a magnificent bay, up to any weight; the other  a sturdy brown. Sapt signed to me to mount the bay. Without a word  to the man, we mounted and rode away. The town was full of noise and  merriment, but we took secluded ways. My cloak was wrapped over half  my face; the capacious flat cap hid every lock of my tell-tale hair. By  Sapt's directions, I crouched on my saddle, and rode with such a round  back as I hope never to exhibit on a horse again. Down a long narrow  lane we went, meeting some wanderers and some roisterers; and, as we  rode, we heard the Cathedral bells still clanging out their welcome to  the King. It was half-past six, and still light. At last we came to the  city wall and to a gate.    \"Have your weapon ready,\" whispered Sapt. \"We must stop his mouth, if he  talks.\"    I put my hand on my revolver. Sapt hailed the doorkeeper. The stars  fought for us! A little girl of fourteen tripped out.    \"Please, sir, father's gone to see the King.\"    \"He'd better have stayed here,\" said Sapt to me, grinning.    \"But he said I wasn't to open the gate, sir.\"    \"Did he, my dear?\" said Sapt, dismounting. \"Then give me the key.\"    The key was in the child's hand. Sapt gave her a crown.    \"Here's an order from the King. Show it to your father. Orderly, open  the gate!\"    I leapt down. Between us we rolled back the great gate, led our horses  out, and closed it again.    \"I shall be sorry for the doorkeeper if Michael finds out that he wasn't  there. Now then, lad, for a canter. We mustn't go too fast while we're  near the town.\"    Once, however, outside the city, we ran little danger, for everybody  else was inside, merry-making; and as the evening fell we quickened our  pace, my splendid horse bounding along under me as though I had been a  feather. It was a fine night, and presently the moon appeared. We talked  little on the way, and chiefly about the progress we were making.    \"I wonder what the duke's despatches told him,\" said I, once.    \"Ay, I wonder!\" responded Sapt.    We stopped for a draught of wine and to bait our horses, losing half an  hour thus. I dared not go into the inn, and stayed with the horses  in the stable. Then we went ahead again, and had covered some  five-and-twenty miles, when Sapt abruptly stopped.    \"Hark!\" he cried.    I listened. Away, far behind us, in the still of the evening--it was  just half-past nine--we heard the beat of horses' hoofs. The wind  blowing strong behind us, carried the sound. I glanced at Sapt.    \"Come on!\" he cried, and spurred his horse into a gallop. When we next  paused to listen, the hoof-beats were not audible, and we relaxed our  pace. Then we heard them again. Sapt jumped down and laid his ear to the  ground.    \"There are two,\" he said. \"They're only a mile behind. Thank God the  road curves in and out, and the wind's our way.\"    We galloped on. We seemed to be holding our own. We had entered the  outskirts of the forest of Zenda, and the trees, closing in behind us as  the track zigged and zagged, prevented us seeing our pursuers, and them  from seeing us.    Another half-hour brought us to a divide of the road. Sapt drew rein.    \"To the right is our road,\" he said. \"To the left, to the Castle. Each  about eight miles. Get down.\"    \"But they'll be on us!\" I cried.    \"Get down!\" he repeated brusquely; and I obeyed. The wood was dense up  to the very edge of the road. We led our horses into the covert, bound  handkerchiefs over their eyes, and stood beside them.    \"You want to see who they are?\" I whispered.    \"Ay, and where they're going,\" he answered.    I saw that his revolver was in his hand.    Nearer and nearer came the hoofs. The moon shone out now clear and full,  so that the road was white with it. The ground was hard, and we had left  no traces.    \"Here they come!\" whispered Sapt.    \"It's the duke!\"    \"I thought so,\" he answered.    It was the duke; and with him a burly fellow whom I knew well, and who  had cause to know me afterwards--Max Holf, brother to Johann the keeper,  and body-servant to his Highness. They were up to us: the duke reined  up. I saw Sapt's finger curl lovingly towards the trigger. I believe  he would have given ten years of his life for a shot; and he could have  picked off Black Michael as easily as I could a barn-door fowl in a  farmyard. I laid my hand on his arm. He nodded reassuringly: he was  always ready to sacrifice inclination to duty.    \"Which way?\" asked Black Michael.    \"To the Castle, your Highness,\" urged his companion. \"There we shall  learn the truth.\"    For an instant the duke hesitated.    \"I thought I heard hoofs,\" said he.    \"I think not, your Highness.\"    \"Why shouldn't we go to the lodge?\"    \"I fear a trap. If all is well, why go to the lodge? If not, it's a  snare to trap us.\"    Suddenly the duke's horse neighed. In an instant we folded our cloaks  close round our horses' heads, and, holding them thus, covered the duke  and his attendant with our revolvers. If they had found us, they had  been dead men, or our prisoners.    Michael waited a moment longer. Then he cried:    \"To Zenda, then!\" and setting spurs to his horse, galloped on.    Sapt raised his weapon after him, and there was such an expression  of wistful regret on his face that I had much ado not to burst out  laughing.    For ten minutes we stayed where we were.    \"You see,\" said Sapt, \"they've sent him news that all is well.\"    \"What does that mean?\" I asked.    \"God knows,\" said Sapt, frowning heavily. \"But it's brought him from  Strelsau in a rare puzzle.\"    Then we mounted, and rode as fast as our weary horses could lay their  feet to the ground. For those last eight miles we spoke no more. Our  minds were full of apprehension. \"All is well.\" What did it mean? Was  all well with the King?    At last the lodge came in sight. Spurring our horses to a last gallop,  we rode up to the gate. All was still and quiet. Not a soul came to meet  us. We dismounted in haste. Suddenly Sapt caught me by the arm.    \"Look there!\" he said, pointing to the ground.    I looked down. At my feet lay five or six silk handkerchiefs, torn and  slashed and rent. I turned to him questioningly.    \"They're what I tied the old woman up with,\" said he. \"Fasten the  horses, and come along.\"    The handle of the door turned without resistance. We passed into the  room which had been the scene of last night's bout. It was still strewn  with the remnants of our meal and with empty bottles.    \"Come on,\" cried Sapt, whose marvellous composure had at last almost  given way.    We rushed down the passage towards the cellars. The door of the  coal-cellar stood wide open.    \"They found the old woman,\" said I.    \"You might have known that from the handkerchiefs,\" he said.    Then we came opposite the door of the wine-cellar. It was shut. It  looked in all respects as it had looked when we left it that morning.    \"Come, it's all right,\" said I.    A loud oath from Sapt rang out. His face turned pale, and he pointed  again at the floor. From under the door a red stain had spread over the  floor of the passage and dried there. Sapt sank against the opposite  wall. I tried the door. It was locked.    \"Where's Josef?\" muttered Sapt.    \"Where's the King?\" I responded.    Sapt took out a flask and put it to his lips. I ran back to the  dining-room, and seized a heavy poker from the fireplace. In my terror  and excitement I rained blows on the lock of the door, and I fired a  cartridge into it. It gave way, and the door swung open.    \"Give me a light,\" said I; but Sapt still leant against the wall.    He was, of course, more moved than I, for he loved his master. Afraid  for himself he was not--no man ever saw him that; but to think what  might lie in that dark cellar was enough to turn any man's face pale.  I went myself, and took a silver candlestick from the dining-table and  struck a light, and, as I returned, I felt the hot wax drip on my naked  hand as the candle swayed to and fro; so that I cannot afford to despise  Colonel Sapt for his agitation.    I came to the door of the cellar. The red stain turning more and more to  a dull brown, stretched inside. I walked two yards into the cellar, and  held the candle high above my head. I saw the full bins of wine; I saw  spiders crawling on the walls; I saw, too, a couple of empty bottles  lying on the floor; and then, away in the corner, I saw the body of a  man, lying flat on his back, with his arms stretched wide, and a crimson  gash across his throat. I walked to him and knelt down beside him, and  commended to God the soul of a faithful man. For it was the body of  Josef, the little servant, slain in guarding the King.    I felt a hand on my shoulders, and, turning, saw Sapt, eyes glaring and  terror-struck, beside me.    \"The King? My God! the King?\" he whispered hoarsely.    I threw the candle's gleam over every inch of the cellar.    \"The King is not here,\" said I.          CHAPTER 7    His Majesty Sleeps in Strelsau      I put my arm round Sapt's waist and supported him out of the cellar,  drawing the battered door close after me. For ten minutes or more we sat  silent in the dining-room. Then old Sapt rubbed his knuckles into his  eyes, gave one great gasp, and was himself again. As the clock on the  mantelpiece struck one he stamped his foot on the floor, saying:    \"They've got the King!\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"'all's well!' as Black"]]]
