Put some butter into a frying-pan  over the fire, and when it is boiling hot lay in the fish. When  they are about half done put the onions and parsley into the pan.  Keep turning the fish that the onions and parsley may adhere to  both sides. When quite done, put them into the dish in which they  are to go to table, and garnish the edge of the dish with hard  boiled eggs cut in round slices.    Make in the pan in which they have been fried, a gravy, by adding  some butter rolled in flour, and a small quantity of vinegar. Pour  it into the dish with the fish.      STURGEON CUTLETS OR STEAKS.    This is the most approved way of dressing sturgeon. Carefully take  off the skin, as its oiliness will give the fish a strong and  disagreeable taste when cooked. Cut from the tail-piece slices  about half an inch thick, rub them with salt, and broil them over  a clear fire of bright coals. Butter them, sprinkle them with  cayenne pepper, and send them to table hot, garnished with sliced  lemon, as lemon-juice is generally squeezed over them when eaten.    Another way is to make a seasoning of bread-crumbs, sweet herbs,  pepper and salt. First dip the slices of sturgeon, in beaten yolk  of egg, then cover them with seasoning, wrap them up closely in  sheets of white paper well buttered, broil them over a clear fire,  and send them to table either with or without the papers.      STEWED CARP.    Having cut off the head, tail, and fins, season the carp with  salt, peppers and powdered mace, both, inside and out. Rub the  seasoning on very well, and let them lay in it an hour, Then put  them into a stew-pan with a little parsley shred fine, a whole  onion, a little sweet marjoram, a tea-cup of thick cream or very  rich milk, and a lump of butter rolled in flour. Pour in  sufficient water to cover the carp, and let it stew half an hour.    Perch may be done in the same way.    You may dress a piece of sturgeon in this manner, but you must  first boil it for twenty minutes to extract the oil. Take off the  skin before you proceed to stew the fish.      CHOWDER.    Take a pound or more of salt pork, and having half boiled it, cut  it into slips, and with some of them cover the bottom of a pot.  Then strew on some sliced onion. Have ready a large fresh cod, or  an equal quantity of haddock, tutaug, or any other firm fish. Cut  the fish into large pieces, and lay part of it on the pork and  onions. Season it with pepper. Then cover it with a layer of  biscuit, or crackers that have been previously soaked in milk or  water. You may add also a layer of sliced potatoes.    Next proceed with a second layer of pork, onions, fish, &c. and  continue as before till the pot is nearly full; finishing with  soaked crackers. Pour in about a pint and a half of cold water.  Cover it close, set it on hot coals, and let it simmer about an  hour. Then skim it, and turn it out into a deep dish. Leave the  gravy in the pot till you have thickened it with a piece of butter  rolled in flour, and some chopped parsley. Then give it one boil  up, and pour it hot into the dish.    Chowder may be made of clams, first cutting off the hard part.          SHELL FISH      PICKLED OYSTERS.    Take a hundred and fifty fine large oysters, and pick off  carefully the bits of shell that may be sticking to them. Lay the  oysters in a deep dish, and then strain the liquor over them. Put  them into an iron skillet that is lined with porcelain, and add  salt to your taste. Without salt they will not be firm enough. Set  the skillet on hot coals, and allow the oysters to simmer till  they are heated all through, but not till they boil. Then take out  the oysters and put them into a stone jar, leaving the liquor in  the skillet. Add to it a pint of clear strong vinegar, a large  tea-spoonful of blades of mace, three dozen whole cloves, and  three dozen whole pepper corns. Let it come to a boil, and when  the oysters are quite cold in the jar, pour the liquor oh them.    They are fit for use immediately, but are better the next day. In  cold weather they will keep a week.    If you intend sending them a considerable distance you must allow  the oysters to boil, and double the proportions of the pickle and  spice.      FRIED OYSTERS.    Get the largest and finest oysters. After they are taken from the  shell wipe each of them quite dry with a cloth. Then beat up in a  pan yolk of egg and milk, (in the proportion of two yolks to half  a jill or a wine glass of milk,) and grate some stale broad grated  very fine in a large flat dish. Cut up at least half a pound of  fresh butter in the frying-pan, and hold it over the fire till it  is boiling hot. Dip the oysters all over lightly in the mixture of  egg and milk, and then roll them up and down in the grated bread,  making as many crumbs stick to them as you can.    Put them into the frying-pan of hot butter, and keep it over a hot  fire. Fry them brown, turning them that they may be equally  browned on both sides. If properly done they will be crisp, and  not greasy.    Serve them, dry in a hot dish, and do not pour over them the  butter that may be left in the pan when they are fried.    Oysters are very good taken out of the shells and broiled on a  gridiron.      SCOLLOPED OYSTERS.    Having grated a sufficiency of stale bread, butter a deep dish,  and line the sides and bottom thickly with bread crumbs. Then put  in a layer of seasoned oysters, with a few very small bits of  butter on them. Cover them thickly with crumbs, and put in another  layer of oysters and butter, till the dish is filled up, having a  thick layer of crumbs on the top. Put the dish into an oven, and  bake them a very short time, or they will shrivel. Serve them up  hot.    You may bake them in large clam shells, or in the tin scollop  shells made for the purpose. Butter the bottom of each shell;  sprinkle it with bread crumbs; lay on the oysters seasoned with  cayenne and nutmeg, and put a morsel of butter on each. Fill up  the shells with a little of the oyster liquor thickened with bread  crumbs, and set them on a gridiron over coals, browning them  afterwards with a red-hot shovel.      STEWED OYSTERS.    Put the oysters into a sieve, and set it on a pan to drain the  liquor from them. Then cut off the hard part, and put the oysters  into a stew-pan with some whole pepper, a few blades of mace, and  some grated nutmeg. Add a small piece of butter rolled in flour.  Then pour over them about half of the liquor, or a little more.  Set the pan on hot coals, and simmer them gently about five  minutes. Try one, and if it tastes raw cook them a little longer.  Make some thin slices of toast, having cut off all the crust.  Butter the toast and lay it in the bottom of a deep dish. Put the  oysters upon it with the liquor in which they were stewed.    The liquor of oysters should never be thickened by stirring in  flour. It spoils the taste, and gives them a sodden and  disagreeable appearance, and is no longer practised by good cooks.      OYSTER FRITTERS.    Have ready some of the finest and largest oysters; drain them from  the liquor and wipe them dry.    Beat six eggs very light, and stir into them gradually six table-spoonfuls  of line sifted flour. Add by degrees a pint and a half  of rich milk and some grated nutmeg, and beat it to a smooth  batter.    Make your frying-pan very hot, and put into it a piece of butter  or lard. When it has melted and begins to froth, put in a small  ladle-full of the batter, drop an oyster in the middle of it, and  fry it of a light brown. Send them to table hot.    If you find your batter too thin, so that it spreads too much in  the frying-pan, add a little more flour beaten well into it. If it  is too thick, thin it with some additional milk.      OYSTER PIE.    Make a puff-paste, in the proportion of a pound and a half of  fresh butter to two pounds of sifted flour. Roll it out rather  thick, into two sheets. Butter a deep dish, and line the bottom  and sides of it with paste. Fill it up with crusts of bread for  the purpose of supporting the lid while it is baking, as the  oysters will be too much done if they are cooked in the pie. Cover  it with the other sheet of paste, having first buttered the flat  rim of the dish. Notch the edges of the pie handsomely, or  ornament them with leaves of paste which you may form with tin  cutters made for the purpose. Make a little slit in the middle of  the lid, and stick firmly into it a paste tulip or other flower.  Put the dish into a moderate oven, and while the paste is baking  prepare the oysters, which should he large and fresh. Put them  into a stew-pan with half their liquor thickened with yolk of egg  boiled hard and grated, enriched with pieces of butter rolled in  bread crumbs, and seasoned with mace and nutmeg. Stew the oysters  five minutes. When the paste is baked, carefully take off the lid,  remove the pieces of bread, and put in the oysters and gravy.  Replace the lid, and send the pie to table warm.      TO BOIL A LOBSTER.    Put a handful of salt into a large kettle or pot of boiling water.  When the water boils very hard put in the lobster, having first  brushed it, and tied the claws together with a bit of twine. Keep  it boiling from half an hour to an hour in proportion to its size.  If boiled too long the meat will be hard and stringy. When it is  done, take it out, lay it on its claws to drain, and then wipe it  dry. Send it to table cold, with the body and tail split open, and  the claws taken off. Lay the large claws next to the body, and the  small ones outside. Garnish with double parsley.    It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster,  and what are called the lady-fingers are not to be eaten.      TO DRESS LOBSTER COLD.    Put a table-spoonful of cold water on a clean plate and with the  back of a wooden spoon mash into it the coral or scarlet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9628"],[0,"Buried Cities: Pompeii, Olympia, Mycenae (Complete) (#8)"],[1," thousand people could come and watch the gladiators fight in pairs till  one was killed. Then the dead body was dragged off, and another pair  appeared and fought. Sometimes the gladiators were prisoners captured in  war, like the famous Spartacus; sometimes they were slaves; sometimes  criminals condemned to death. Sometimes a man was pitted against a wild  beast; sometimes two wild beasts fought each other. The amphitheater had  no roof. Vesuvius, with its column of smoke, was in plain view from the  seats. There was a great awning to protect the spectators. The lower  seats were for officials and distinguished people; for the middle rows  there was an admission fee; all the upper seats were free.      RUINS OF THE GREAT STABIAN BATHS.    A few large houses had baths of their own, but most people went every  day to a great public bath which was a very gay place. This open court  which you see, was for games.      THE RUINED TEMPLE OF APOLLO.    The temple was built on a high foundation. A broad flight of steps led  up to it, with an altar at the foot. There was a porch all round it held  up by a row of columns. Some of the columns have stood up through all  the earthquakes and eruptions of two thousand years. Inside the porch  was a small room for the statue of Apollo. In the paved court around  this temple were many altars and statues of the gods. This was at one  time the most important temple in Pompeii.      THE SCHOOL OF THE GLADIATORS.    In this large open court the gladiators had their training and practice.  In small cells around the court they lived. They were kept under close  guard, for they were dangerous men. Sixty-three skeletons were found  here, many of them in irons.      THE SMALLER THEATER.    Pompeii had two theaters for plays and music, besides the amphitheater  where the gladiators fought. The smaller theater, unlike the others, had  a roof. It seated fifteen hundred people. We think perhaps contests in  music were held here.      A SACRIFICE.    A boar, a ram, and a bull are to be killed, and a part of the flesh is  to be burned on the altar to please the gods.      A SCENE IN THE FORUM.    On the walls of a room in a house in Pompeii men found this picture,  showing how interesting the life of the forum was. At the left is a  table where a man has kitchen utensils for sale. But he is dreaming and  does not see a customer coming. So his friend is waking him up. Near him  is a shoemaker selling sandals to some women.      IVORY HAIRPINS.    Underneath are two ivory toilet boxes. One was probably for perfumed  oil.      APPLIANCES FOR THE BATH.    These were found hanging in a ring in one of the great public baths. You  see a flask for oil, a saucer to pour the oil into, and four scrapers to  scrape off the oil and dirt before a plunge.      PERISTYLE OF THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII.    With the columns and tables and statues that were found, this court has  been built on the site of an old ruined villa. Flowers bloom and the  fountain plays in it to-day just as they did over two thousand years  ago. There are wall paintings in the shadows at the back. The little  boys holding the ducks must look very much like Caius when he was a  little boy. When he went to the farm in the hills for a hot summer, he  had ducks to play with; here are statues to remind him, in the winter  time, of what fun that was.    A garden like this, not generally so large, was laid out _inside_ every  important house in Pompeii. The family rooms surrounded it. These rooms  received most of their light and air from this garden. Caius was lying  on a couch in a garden like this, when the shower of pebbles suddenly  began. Ariston was painting the walls of a room that overlooked the  garden.      LADY PLAYING A HARP.    This is part of a beautiful wall painting in a Pompeian house, the sort  of painting that Ariston was making when the volcano burst forth. See  how much the little boy looks like his mother, and what beautiful bands  they both have in their hair. Chairs like this one have been found in  the ruins, and the same design is on many other pieces of furniture.    The Metropolitan Museum owns the complete wall paintings for a Pompeian  room. They are put up just as they were in Pompeii. There is even an  iron window grating. A beautiful table from Pompeii stands in the  center. The room is one of the gayest in the whole museum, with its rich  reds and bright yellows, greens, and blues.      KITCHEN OF THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII.    In this house the cook must have been in the kitchen, just ready to go  to work when he had to flee. He left the pot on a tripod on a bed of  coals, ready for use. You can see an arched opening underneath the  fireplace. This was where the cook kept his fuel. The small size of  the kitchens shows that the Pompeians were not great gluttons.      KITCHEN UTENSILS.    These kettles and frying pans and ladles are made of bronze, an alloy of  copper and tin. They look very much like our kitchen furnishings.      CENTAUR CUP.    Some rich Pompeian had a pair of beautiful silver cups with graceful  handles. The design was made in hammered silver, and showed centaurs  talking to cupids that are sitting on their backs. A centaur was half  man, half horse.      THE HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET (restored).    From the ruins and from ancient books, men know almost all the rooms of  a Pompeian house. So they have pictured this one as it was before the  disaster, with its many beautiful wall paintings, its mosaic floors, its  tiled roofs. If you can imagine these two halves fitted together, and  yourself inside, you can visit one of the most attractive houses in  Pompeii. Do you see how the tiled roof slants downward from four sides  to a rectangular opening in the highest part of the house? Below this  opening was a shallow basin into which the rainwater fell. This basin  was in the center of the atrium, the most important room in the house.  The walls of this room were painted with scenes from the Trojan war.  This is the house which has the mosaic picture of a dog on the floor of  the long entrance hall (see next page). On each side of the hall, facing  the street, are large rooms for shops, where, doubtless, the owner  conducted his business. He was not a \"Tragic Poet.\" Some people think he  was a goldsmith. On each side of the atrium were sleeping rooms. Can you  see that the doors are very high with a grating at the top to let in  light and air? Windows were few and small, and generally the rooms took  light and air from the inside courts rather than from outside. Back of  the atrium was a large reception room with bedrooms on each side. And  back of this was a large open court, or garden, with a colonnade on  three sides and a solid wall at the back. Opening on this garden was a  large dining room with beautiful wall paintings, a tiny kitchen, and  some sleeping rooms. This house had stairways and second story rooms  over the shops. This seems to us a very comfortable homelike house.      THE HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET (as it looks to-day).    Here you see the shallow basin in the floor of the atrium. This basin  had two outlets. You can see the round cistern mouth near the pool.  There was also an outlet to the street to carry off the overflow. At the  back of the garden you can see a shrine to the household gods. At every  meal a portion was set aside in little dishes for the gods.      MOSAIC OF WATCH DOG.    From the vestibule of the House of the Tragic Poet. It says loudly,  \"Beware the dog!\" Pictures and patterns made of little pieces of  polished stone like this are called mosaic. Sometimes American  vestibules are tiled in a simple mosaic. Wouldn't it be fun if they had  such exciting pictures as this? A real dog, or two or three, probably  was standing inside the door, chained, or held by slaves.      THE HOUSE OF DIOMEDE.    There was a wine cellar under the colonnade. Here were twenty skeletons;  two, children. Near the door were found skeletons of two men. One had a  large key, doubtless the key of this door. He wore a gold ring and was  carrying a good deal of money. He was probably the master of the house.  Evidently the family thought at first that the wine cellar would be a  safe place, but when they found that it was not so, the master took one  slave and started out to find a way to escape. But they all perished.      RUINS OF A BAKERY, WITH MILLSTONES.      SECTION OF A MILL.    If one of the mills that were found in the bakery were sawed in two, it  would look like this. You can see where the baker's man poured in the  wheat, and where the flour dropped down, and the heavy timbers fastened  to the upper millstone to turn it by.      PORTRAIT OF LUCIUS CAECILIUS JUCUNDUS.    This Lucius was an auctioneer who had set free one of his slaves, Felix.  Felix, in gratitude, had this portrait of his master cast in bronze.  It stood on a marble pillar in the atrium of the house.      BRONZE CANDLEHOLDER.    It is the figure of the Roman God Silenus. He was the son of Pan, and  the oldest of the satyrs, who were supposed to be half goat. Can you  find the goat's horns among his curls? He was a rollicking old satyr,  very fond of wine, always getting into mischief. The grape design at the  base of the little statue, and the snake supporting the candleholder,  both are symbols of the sileni.      THE DANCING FAUN.    In one of the largest and most elegant houses in Pompeii, on the floor  of the atrium, or principal room of the house, men found in the ashes  this bronze statue of a dancing faun. Doesn't he look as if he loved  to dance, snapping his fingers to keep time? Although this great house  contained on the floor of one room the most famous of ancient mosaic  pictures, representing Alexander the Great in battle, and although it  contains many other fine mosaics, it was named from this statue, the  House of the Faun, Casa del Fauno.      HERMES IN REPOSE.    This bronze statue was"]]]
