Trees and Shrubs (#9)"],[1,"yellow fruit. Generally the Aronia  Thorn forms a rather upright and branchy specimen of neat proportions,  and when studded with its milk-white flowers may be included amongst  the most distinct and ornamental of the family.    C. COCCINEA.--Scarlet-fruited Thorn. North America, 1683. If only for  its lovely white flowers, with bright, pinky anthers, it is well worthy  of a place even in a selection of ornamental flowering trees and  shrubs. It is, however, rendered doubly valuable in that the  cordate-ovate leaves turn of a warm brick colour in the autumn, while  the fruit, and which is usually produced abundantly, is of the  brightest red.    C. COCCINEA MACRANTHA.--North America, 1819. This bears some resemblance  to the Cockspur Thorn, but has very long, curved spines--longer, perhaps,  than those of any other species.    C. CORDATA is one of the latest flowering species, in which respect it  is even more hardy than the well-known C. tanace-tifolia. It forms a  small compact tree, of neat and regular outline, with dark green  shining leaves, and berries about the same size as those of the common  species, and deep red.    C. CRUS-GALLI.--Cockspur Thorn. North America, 1691. This has large  and showy white flowers that are succeeded by deep red berries. It is  readily distinguished by the long, curved spines with which the whole  tree is beset. Of this species there are numerous worthy forms,  including C. Crus-galli Carrierii, which opens at first white, and  then turns a showy flesh colour; C. Crus-galli Layi, C. Crus-galli  splendens, C. Crus-galli prunifolia, C. Crus-galli pyracanthifolia, and  C. Crus-galli salicifolia, all forms of great beauty--whether for their  foliage, or beautiful and usually plentifully-produced flowers.    C. DOUGLASII.--North America, 1830. This is peculiar in having dark  purple or almost black fruit. It is of stout growth, often reaching to  20 feet in height, and belongs to the early-flowering section.    C. NIGRA (_syn C. Celsiana_).--A tree 20 feet high, with stout branches,  and downy, spineless shoots. Leaves large, ovate-acute, deeply incised,  glossy green above and downy beneath. Flowers large and fragrant, pure  white, and produced in close heads in June. Fruit large, oval, downy,  and yellow when fully ripe. A native of Sicily, and known under the  names of C. incisa and C. Leeana. This species must not be confused  with a variety of our common Thorn bearing a similar name.    C. OXYACANTHA.--Common Hawthorn. This is, perhaps, the most ornamental  species in cultivation, and certainly the commonest. The common wild  species needs no description, the fragrant flowers varying in colour  from pure white to pink, being produced in the richest profusion. Under  cultivation, however, it has produced some very distinct and desirable  forms, far superior to the parent, including amongst others those with  double-white, pink, and scarlet flowers.    C. OXYACANTHA PUNICEA flore-pleno (Paul's double-scarlet Thorn), is one  of, if not the handsomest variety, with large double flowers that are  of the richest crimson. Other good flowering kinds include C.  Oxyacantha praecox (Glastonbury Thorn); C. Oxyacantha Oliveriana; C.  Oxyacantha punicea, with deep scarlet flowers; C. Oxyacantha rosea,  rose-coloured and abundantly-produced flowers; C. Oxyacantha foliis  aureis, with yellow fruit; C. Oxyacantha laciniata, cut leaves; C.  Oxyacantha multiplex, double-white flowers; C. Oxyacantha foliis  argenteis, having silvery-variegated leaves: C. Oxyacantha pendula, of  semi-weeping habit; C. Oxyacantha stricta, with an upright and stiff  habit of growth; C. Oxyacantha Leeana, a good form; and C. Oxyacantha  leucocarpa.    C. PARVIFOLIA.--North America, 1704. This is a miniature Thorn, of slow  growth, with leaves about an inch long, and solitary pure-white flowers  of large size. The flowers open late in the season, and are succeeded  by yellowish-green fruit.    C. PYRACANTHA.--Fiery Thorn. South Europe, 1629. This is a very  distinct species, with lanceolate serrated leaves, and pinkish or  nearly white flowers. The berries of this species are, however, the  principal attraction, being orange-scarlet, and produced in dense  clusters. C. Pyracantha crenulata and C. Pyracantha Lelandi are worthy  varieties of the above, the latter especially being one of the most  ornamental-berried shrubs in cultivation.    C. TANACETIFOLIA.--Tansy-leaved Thorn. Greece, 1789. This is a very  late-flowering species, and remarkable for its Tansy-like foliage. It  is of unusually free growth, and in almost any class of soil, and is  undoubtedly, in so far at least as neatly divided leaves and wealth of  fruit are concerned, one of the most distinct and desirable species of  Thorn.    Other good species and varieties that may just be mentioned as being  worthy of cultivation are C. apiifolia, C. Crus-galli horrida, C.  orientalis, and C. tomentosum (_syn C. punctata_). To a lesser or  greater extent, the various species and varieties of Thorn are of great  value for the wealth and beauty of flowers they produce, but the above  are, perhaps, the most desirable in that particular respect. They are  all of free growth, and, except in waterlogged soils, thrive well and  flower freely.      CYTISUS.    CYTISUS ALBUS.--White Spanish Broom. Portugal, 1752. This is a  large-growing shrub of often 10 feet in height, with wiry, somewhat  straggling branches, and remarkable for the wealth of pure-white  flowers it produces. In May and June, if favourably situated, every  branch is wreathed with small white flowers, and often to such an  extent that at a short distance away the plant looks like a sheet of  white. Being perfectly hardy and of very free growth in any light soil,  and abundantly floriferous, this handsome shrub is one of particular  value in ornamental planting. By placing three or five plants in  clump-fashion, the beauty of this Broom is greatly enhanced.    C. ALDUS INCARNATUS (_syn C. incarnatus_) resembles C. purpureus in its  leaves and general appearance, but it is of larger growth. The flowers,  which are at their best in May, are of a vinous-rose colour, and  produced plentifully.    C. BIFLORUS (_syn C. elongatus_).--Hungary, 1804. This is a dwarf,  spreading, twiggy bush, of fully a yard high. Leaves trifoliolate,  clothed beneath with closely adpressed hairs, and bright yellow,  somewhat tubular flowers, usually produced in fours.    C. DECUMBENS.--A charming alpine species, of low, spreading growth,  bright-green three-parted leaves, and bearing axillary bunches of large  yellow, brownish-purple tinted flowers. A native of the French and  Italian Alps, and quite hardy.    C. NIGRICANS.--Austria, 1730. Another beautiful species, with long,  erect racemes of golden-yellow flowers, and one whose general hardihood  is undoubted. On its own roots, and allowed to roam at will, this  pretty, small-growing Broom is of far greater interest than when it is  grafted mop-high on a Laburnum stem, and pruned into artificial shapes,  as is, unfortunately, too often the case.    C. PURPUREUS.--Purple Broom. Austria, 1792. Alow, spreading shrub, with  long wiry shoots, clothed with neat trifoliolate leaves, and bearing an  abundance of its purple, Pea-shaped flowers. There is a white-flowered  form, C. purpureus albus, and another named C. purpureus ratis-bonensis,  with pretty yellow flowers, produced on long and slender shoots.    C. SCOPARIUS.--Yellow Broom. This is a well-known native shrub, with  silky, angular branches, and bright yellow flowers in summer. There are  several varieties, but the most remarkable and handsome is C. scoparius  Andreanus, in which the wings of the flowers are of a rich golden  brown. It is one of the showiest shrubs in cultivation.    For ornamental planting the above are about the best forms of Broom,  but others might include C. austriacus, C. Ardoini, and C. capitatus,  the latter being unusually hardy, and bearing dense heads of flowers.  In so far as soil is concerned, the Brooms are readily accommodated,  while either from seeds or cuttings they are easily propagated.      DABOECIA.    DABOECIA POLIFOLIA (_syn Menziesia polifolia_).--St. Dabeoc's Heath.  South Western Europe, Ireland and the Azores. A dwarf, and rather  straggling, viscid shrub, with linear-ovate leaves that are silvery  beneath. The flowers are pink, and abundantly produced. D. polifolia  alba has white flowers; and D. polifolia atro-purpurea, purplish  flowers.      DANAE.    DANAE LAURUS (_syn D. racemosa_ and _Ruscus racemosus_).--Alexandrian  Laurel. A native of Portugal (1739), with glossy-green leaf substitutes,  and racemes of small, not very showy, greenish-yellow flowers.      DAPHNE.    DAPHNE ALPINA.--Italy, 1759. A deciduous species, which has white or  rosy-white, sweet-scented flowers. It is a pretty, but rare shrub, that  grows well in light sandy leaf soil.    D. ALTAICA.--Siberia, 1796. Though rare in gardens, this is a pretty  and neat-foliaged species, and bears white flowers in abundance. It  wants a warm corner and dry soil.    D. BLAGAYANA.--Styria, 1872. This is still rare in cultivation, but it  is a very desirable species, bearing ivory-white highly-fragrant  flowers. For the alpine garden it is particularly suitable, and though  growing rather slowly thrives well in good light soil.    D. CHAMPIONI  (_syn D. Fortunei_), from China, is a rare and pretty species, bearing  lilac flowers in winter, and whilst the shrub is leafless. It does best  in a warm situation, such as planted against a wall facing south.    D. CNEORUM.--Garland Flower. South Europe, 1752. This is a charming  rock shrub, of dwarf, trailing habit, with small glossy-green leaves,  and dense clusters of deep pink, deliciously-fragrant flowers.    D. FIONIANA is of neat growth, with small, glossy, dark leaves, and  pale rose-coloured flowers. Its sturdy, dwarf habit, constant verdure,  and pretty sweet-"]]]
