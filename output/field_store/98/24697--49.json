The father of our author held the highest places  under King Henry VIII, and had so faithfully and bravely served him,  that the nobility grew jealous of his influence, and by their united  efforts produced his ruin. After many excellent services in France, he  was constituted Lord Treasurer, and made General of the King's whole  army design'd to march against the Scots: At the battle of Flodden,  in which the Scots were routed and their Sovereign slain, the earl of  Surry remarkably distinguished himself; he commanded under his father,  and as soon as the jealousy of the Peers had fastened upon the one,  they took care that the other should not escape. He was the first  nobleman (says Camden) that illustrated his high birth with the beauty  of learning; he was acknowledged by all, to be the gallantest man,  the politest lover, and the most compleat gentleman of his time. He  received his education at Windsor with a natural son of Henry VIII,  and became first eminent for his devotion to the beautiful Geraldine,  Maid of Honour to Queen Catherine; the first inspired him with poetry,  and that poetry has conferred immortality on her: So transported was  he with his passion, that he made a tour to the most elegant courts  in Europe, to maintain her peerless beauty against all opposers,  and every where made good his challenge with honour. In his way  to Florence, he touched at the emperor's court, where he became  acquainted with the learned Cornelius Agrippa, so famous for magic,  who shewed him the image of his Geraldine in a glass, sick, weeping on  her bed, and melting into devotion for the absence of her lord; upon  sight of this he wrote the following passionate sonnet, which for  the smoothness of the verse, the tenderness of expression, and the  heartfelt sentiments might do honour to the politest, easiest, most  passionate poet in our own times.      All soul, no earthly flesh, why dost thou fade?    All gold; no earthly dross, why look'st thou    pale?    Sickness how darest thou one so fair invade?    Too base infirmity to work her bale.    Heaven be distempered since she grieved    pines,    Never be dry, these my sad plaintive lines.      Pearch thou my spirit on her silver breasts,    And with their pains redoubled musick beatings,    Let them toss thee to world where all toil rests,    Where bliss is subject to no fears defeatings,    Her praise I tune, whose tongue doth tune    the spheres,    And gets new muses in her hearers ears.      Stars fall to fetch fresh light from the rich eyes,    Her bright brow drives the fun to clouds beneath.    Her hair reflex with red strakes paints the skyes,    Sweet morn and evening dew flows from her    breath:    Phoebe rules tides, she my tears tides forth    draws.    In her sick bed love fits, and maketh laws.      Her dainty lips tinsel her silk-soft sheets,    Her rose-crown'd cheeks eclipse my dazled sight.    O glass with too much joy, my thoughts thou    greets,    And yet thou shewest me day but by twilight.    I'll kiss thee for the kindness I have felt.    Her lips one kiss would into nectar melt.    From the emperor's court he went to the city of Florence, the pride  and glory of Italy, in which city his beauteous Geraldine was born,  and he had no rest till he found out the house of her nativity,  and being shewn the room where his charmer first drew air, he was  transported with extasy of joy, his tongue overflowed with her  praises, and Winstanly says he eclipsed the sun and moon with  comparisons of his Geraldine, and wrote another sonnet in praise  of the chamber that was honoured (as he says) with her radiant  conception; this sonnet is equally amorous and spirited with that  already inserted. In the duke of Florence's court he published a proud  challenge against all comers, whether Christians, Turks, Canibals,  Jews, or Saracens, in defence of his mistress's beauty; this challenge  was the better received there, as she whom he defended was born in  that city: The duke of Florence however sent for him, and enquired of  his fortune, and the intent of his coming to his court; of which when  the earl informed him, he granted to all countries whatever, as well  enemies and outlaws, as friends and allies, free access into his  dominions unmolested till the trial were ended.    In the course of his combats for his mistress, his valour and skill  in arms so engaged the Duke to his interest, that he offered him the  highest preferments if he would remain at his court. This proposal  he rejected, as he intended to proceed thro' all the chief cities in  Italy; but his design was frustrated by letters sent by King Henry  VIII. which commanded his speedy return into England.    In the year 1544, upon the expedition to Boulogne in France, he was  made field marshal of the English army, and after taking that town,  being then knight of the garter, he was in the beginning of September  1545 constituted the King's lieutenant, and captain-general of all his  army within the town and county of Boulogne[1]. During his command  there in 1546, hearing that a convoy of provisions of the enemy was  coming to the fort at Oultreaw, he resolved to intercept it; but  the Rhinegrave, with four thousand Lanskinets, together with a  considerable number of French under the de Bieg, making an obstinate  defence, the English were routed, Sir Edward Poynings with divers  other gentlemen killed, and the Earl himself obliged to fly, tho' it  appears, by a letter to the King dated January 8, 1548, that this  advantage cost the enemy a great number of men. But the King was  so highly displeased with this ill success, that from that time he  contracted a prejudice against the Earl, and soon after removed him  from his command, and appointed the Earl of Hertford to succeed him.  Upon which Sir William Page wrote to the Earl of Surry to advise him  to procure some eminent post under the Earl of Hertford, that he might  not be unprovided in the town and field. The Earl being desirous in  the mean time to regain his former favour with the King, skirmished  with the French and routed them, but soon after writing over to the  King's council that as the enemy had cast much larger cannon than had  been yet seen, with which they imagined they should soon demolish  Boulogne, it deserved consideration whether the lower town should  stand, as not being defensible; the council ordered him to return to  England in order to represent his sentiments more fully upon those  points, and the Earl of Hertford was immediately sent over in his  room. This exasperating the Earl of Surry, occasioned him to let fall  some expressions which favoured of revenge and dislike to the King,  and a hatred of his Councellors, and was probably one cause of his  ruin, which soon after ensued. The Duke of Norfolk, who discovered the  growing power of the Seymours, and the influence they were likely  to bear in the next reign, was for making an alliance with them; he  therefore pressed his son to marry the Earl of Hertford's daughter,  and the Dutchess of Richmond, his own daughter, to marry Sir Thomas  Seymour; but neither of these matches were effected, and the Seymours  and Howards then became open enemies. The Seymours failed not to  inspire the King with an aversion to the Norfolk-family, whose power  they dreaded, and represented the ambitious views of the Earl of  Surry; but to return to him as a poet.    That celebrated antiquary, John Leland, speaking of Sir Thomas Wyat  the Elder, calls the Earl, 'The conscript enrolled heir of the said  Sir Thomas, in his learning and other excellent qualities.' The author  of a treatise, entitled, 'The Art of English Poetry, alledges, that  Sir Thomas Wyat the Elder, and Henry Earl of Surry were the two  chieftains, who having travelled into Italy, and there tasted the  sweet and stately measures and stile of the Italian poetry, greatly  polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poetry, from what it had  been before, and therefore may be justly called, The Reformers of our  English Poetry and Stile.' Our noble author added to learning, wisdom,  fortitude, munificence, and affability. Yet all these excellencies of  character, could not prevent his falling a sacrifice to the jealousy  of the Peers, or as some say to the resentment of the King for his  attempting to wed the Princess Mary; and by these means to raise  himself to the Crown. History is silent as to the reasons why the  gallantries he performed for Geraldine did not issue in a marriage.  Perhaps the reputation he acquired by arms, might have enflamed  his soul with a love of glory; and this conjecture seems the more  probable, as we find his ambition prompting him to make love to  the Princess from no other views but those of dominion.

Once he had  grasped the swinging ape, he would quickly have drawn him within reach  of his jaws.  Tarzan saw and was wroth.  He loved a fair fight, but the  thing which this ape contemplated revolted him.  Already a hairy hand  had clutched the helpless Taug when, with an angry growl of protest,  Tarzan leaped to the branch at the attacking ape's side, and with a  single mighty cuff, swept him from his perch.    Surprised and enraged, the bull clutched madly for support as he  toppled sidewise, and then with an agile movement succeeded in  projecting himself toward another limb a few feet below.  Here he found  a hand-hold, quickly righted himself, and as quickly clambered upward  to be revenged upon Tarzan, but the ape-man was otherwise engaged and  did not wish to be interrupted.  He was explaining again to Taug the  depths of the latter's abysmal ignorance, and pointing out how much  greater and mightier was Tarzan of the Apes than Taug or any other ape.    In the end he would release Taug, but not until Taug was fully  acquainted with his own inferiority.  And then the maddened bull came  from beneath, and instantly Tarzan was transformed from a good-natured,  teasing youth into a snarling, savage beast.  Along his scalp the hair  bristled: his upper lip drew back that his fighting fangs might be  uncovered and ready.  He did not wait for the bull to reach him, for  something in the appearance or the voice of the attacker aroused within  the ape-man a feeling of belligerent antagonism that would not be  denied.  With a scream that carried no human note, Tarzan leaped  straight at the throat of the attacker.    The impetuosity of this act and the weight and momentum of his body  carried the bull backward, clutching and clawing for support, down  through the leafy branches of the tree.  For fifteen feet the two fell,  Tarzan's teeth buried in the jugular of his opponent, when a stout  branch stopped their descent.  The bull struck full upon the small of  his back across the limb, hung there for a moment with the ape-man  still upon his breast, and then toppled over toward the ground.    Tarzan had felt the instantaneous relaxation of the body beneath him  after the heavy impact with the tree limb, and as the other turned  completely over and started again upon its fall toward the ground, he  reached forth a hand and caught the branch in time to stay his own  descent, while the ape dropped like a plummet to the foot of the tree.    Tarzan looked downward for a moment upon the still form of his late  antagonist, then he rose to his full height, swelled his deep chest,  smote upon it with his clenched fist and roared out the uncanny  challenge of the victorious bull ape.    Even Sheeta, the panther, crouched for a spring at the edge of the  little clearing, moved uneasily as the mighty voice sent its weird cry  reverberating through the jungle.  To right and left, nervously,  glanced Sheeta, as though assuring himself that the way of escape lay  ready at hand.    \"I am Tarzan of the Apes,\" boasted the ape-man; \"mighty hunter, mighty  fighter! None in all the jungle so great as Tarzan.\"    Then he made his way back in the direction of Taug.  Teeka had watched  the happenings in the tree.  She had even placed her precious balu upon  the soft grasses and come a little nearer that she might better witness  all that was passing in the branches above her.  In her heart of hearts  did she still esteem the smooth-skinned Tarzan?  Did her savage breast  swell with pride as she witnessed his victory over the ape? You will  have to ask Teeka.    And Sheeta, the panther, saw that the she-ape had left her cub alone  among the grasses.  He moved his tail again, as though this closest  approximation of lashing in which he dared indulge might stimulate his  momentarily waned courage.  The cry of the victorious ape-man still  held his nerves beneath its spell.  It would be several minutes before  he again could bring himself to the point of charging into view of the  giant anthropoids.    And as he regathered his forces, Tarzan reached Taug's side, and then  clambering higher up to the point where the end of the grass rope was  made fast, he unloosed it and lowered the ape slowly downward, swinging  him in until the clutching hands fastened upon a limb.    Quickly Taug drew himself to a position of safety and shook off the  noose.  In his rage-maddened heart was no room for gratitude to the  ape-man. He recalled only the fact that Tarzan had laid this painful  indignity upon him.  He would be revenged, but just at present his legs  were so numb and his head so dizzy that he must postpone the  gratification of his vengeance.    Tarzan was coiling his rope the while he lectured Taug on the futility  of pitting his poor powers, physical and intellectual, against those of  his betters.  Teeka had come close beneath the tree and was peering  upward.  Sheeta was worming his way stealthily forward, his belly close  to the ground.  In another moment he would be clear of the underbrush  and ready for the rapid charge and the quick retreat that would end the  brief existence of Teeka's balu.    Then Tarzan chanced to look up and across the clearing.  Instantly his  attitude of good-natured bantering and pompous boastfulness dropped  from him.  Silently and swiftly he shot downward toward the ground.  Teeka, seeing him coming, and thinking that he was after her or her  balu, bristled and prepared to fight.  But Tarzan sped by her, and as  he went, her eyes followed him and she saw the cause of his sudden  descent and his rapid charge across the clearing.  There in full sight  now was Sheeta, the panther, stalking slowly toward the tiny, wriggling  balu which lay among the grasses many yards away.    Teeka gave voice to a shrill scream of terror and of warning as she  dashed after the ape-man. Sheeta saw Tarzan coming.  He saw the  she-ape's cub before him, and he thought that this other was bent upon  robbing him of his prey.  With an angry growl, he charged.    Taug, warned by Teeka's cry, came lumbering down to her assistance.  Several other bulls, growling and barking, closed in toward the  clearing, but they were all much farther from the balu and the panther  than was Tarzan of the Apes, so it was that Sheeta and the ape-man  reached Teeka's little one almost simultaneously; and there they stood,  one upon either side of it, baring their fangs and snarling at each  other over the little creature.    Sheeta was afraid to seize the balu, for thus he would give the ape-man  an opening for attack; and for the same reason Tarzan hesitated to  snatch the panther's prey out of harm's way, for had he stooped to  accomplish this, the great beast would have been upon him in an  instant.  Thus they stood while Teeka came across the clearing, going  more slowly as she neared the panther, for even her mother love could  scarce overcome her instinctive terror of this natural enemy of her  kind.    Behind her came Taug, warily and with many pauses and much bluster, and  still behind him came other bulls, snarling ferociously and uttering  their uncanny challenges.  Sheeta's yellow-green eyes glared terribly  at Tarzan, and past Tarzan they shot brief glances at the apes of  Kerchak advancing upon him.  Discretion prompted him to turn and flee,  but hunger and the close proximity of the tempting morsel in the grass  before him urged him to remain.  He reached forth a paw toward Teeka's  balu, and as he did so, with a savage guttural, Tarzan of the Apes was  upon him.    The panther reared to meet the ape-man's attack.  He swung a frightful  raking blow for Tarzan that would have wiped his face away had it  landed, but it did not land, for Tarzan ducked beneath it and closed,  his long knife ready in one strong hand--the knife of his dead father,  of the father he never had known.    Instantly the balu was forgotten by Sheeta, the panther.  He now  thought only of tearing to ribbons with his powerful talons the flesh  of his antagonist, of burying his long, yellow fangs in the soft,  smooth hide of the ape-man, but Tarzan had fought before with clawed  creatures of the jungle.  Before now he had battled with fanged  monsters, nor always had he come away unscathed.  He knew the risk that  he ran, but Tarzan of the Apes, inured to the sight of suffering and  death, shrank from neither, for he feared neither.    The instant that he dodged beneath Sheeta's blow, he leaped to the  beast's rear and then full upon the tawny back, burying his teeth in  Sheeta's neck and the fingers of one hand in the fur at the throat, and  with the other hand he drove his blade into Sheeta's side.    Over and over upon the grass rolled Sheeta, growling and screaming,  clawing and biting, in a mad effort to dislodge his antagonist or get  some portion of his body within range of teeth or talons.    As Tarzan leaped to close quarters with the panther, Teeka had run  quickly in and snatched up her balu.  Now she sat upon a high branch,  safe out of harm's way, cuddling the little thing close to her hairy  breast, the while her savage little eyes bored down upon the  contestants in the clearing, and her ferocious voice urged Taug and the  other bulls to leap into the melee.    Thus goaded the bulls came closer, redoubling their hideous clamor; but  Sheeta was already sufficiently engaged--he did not even hear them.  Once he succeeded in partially dislodging the ape-man from his back, so  that Tarzan swung for an instant in front of those awful talons, and in  the brief instant before he could regain his former hold, a raking blow  from a hind paw laid open one leg from hip to knee.      It was the sight and smell of this blood, possibly, which wrought upon  the encircling apes; but it was Taug who really was responsible for the  thing they did.    Taug, but a moment before"]]]
