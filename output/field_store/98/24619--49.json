While Bugtongpalasan was cooking, he felt the earth tremble, and in  a short time he saw a big giant ascending the stairs of the house,  saying, \"Ho, bajo tao cainco,\" [15] which means \"I smell a man whom  I will eat.\" Bugtongpalasan faced him, but what could a man do to  a big giant? The monster pulled a hair out of his head and tied  Bugtongpalasan to a post. Then he cooked his own meal. After eating,  he went away, leaving his prisoner in the house.    When the three arrived, they were very angry with Bugtongpalasan  because no food had been prepared for them; but they untied him,  and made him get the meal. Tunkodbola was the next one left behind  as cook while the others went hunting, but he had the same experience  as Bugtongpalasan. Then Macabuhalbundok; but the same thing happened  to him too.    It was now the turn of Carancal to try his wit, strength, and  luck. Before the three left, he had them shave his head. When the  giant came and saw that Carancal's head was white, he laughed. \"It  is a very fine thing to have a white head,\" said the giant. \"Make my  head white, too.\"    \"Your head must be shaved to be white,\" said Carancal, \"and it is a  very difficult thing to shave a head.\"    \"Never mind that! I want to have my head shaved,\" said the giant  impatiently.    Carancal then got some ropes and wax. He tied the giant tightly to  a post, and then smeared his body with wax. He next took a match and  set the giant's body on fire. Thus the giant was destroyed, and the  four lived in the house as if it were their own.    Not long afterwards a rumor reached their ears. It was to this effect:  that in a certain kingdom on the other side of the sea lived a king who  wanted to have a huge stone removed from its place. This stone was so  big that it covered much ground. The prize that would be given to the  one who could remove it was the hand of the king's prettiest daughter.    The four set out to try their strength. At that time there were  no boats for them to sail on, so they had to swim. After three  weeks' swimming, they landed on an island-like place in the sea,  to rest. It was smooth and slippery, which made them wonder what it  could be. Carancal, accordingly, drew his bolo and thrust it into  the island. How fast the island moved after the stroke! It was not  really an island, but a very big fish. Fortunately the fish carried  the travellers near the shores of the kingdom they were seeking.    When the four arrived, they immediately presented themselves to the  king, and told him that they would try to move the stone. The king  ordered one of his soldiers to show them the stone. There a big crowd  of people collected to watch the four strong men.    The first to try was Bugtongpalasan. He could hardly budge it. Then  Tunkodbola tried, but moved it only a few yards. When Macabuhalbundok's  turn came, he moved the great stone half a mile; but the king said  that it was not satisfactory. Carancal then took hold of the rope  tied to the stone, and gave a swing. In a minute the great stone was  out of sight.    The king was very much pleased, and asked Carancal to choose a princess  for his wife. \"I am not old enough to marry, my lord,\" said Carancal  sadly (sic!). \"I will marry one of my companions to your daughter,  however, if you are willing.\" The king agreed, and Bugtongpalasan  was made a prince.    The three unmarried men lived with Bugtongpalasan. By this time they  were known not only throughout the whole kingdom where they were, but  also in other countries. They had not enjoyed a year's hospitality  in Bugtongpalasan's home when a letter addressed to the four men  came. It was as follows:--    I have heard that you have superhuman strength, which I now greatly  need. About a week ago a monster fish floated up to the shore of my  town. It is decaying, and has a most offensive odor. My men in vain  have tried to drag the fish out into the middle of the sea. I write  to inform you that if you can rid us of it, I will let one of you  marry my prettiest daughter.    King Walangtacut. [16]      After Carancal had read the letter, he instantly remembered the  fish that had helped them in travelling. The three companions made  themselves ready, bade Bugtongpalasan good-by, and set out for  Walangtacut's kingdom. They travelled on foot, for the place was not  very far away.    In every town they passed through, the people cried, \"Hurrah for  the strong men!\" The king received them with a banquet, and all the  houses of the town were decorated with flags. In a word, every one  welcomed them.    After the banquet was over, the three men marched with the king and  all his counsellors, knights, dukes, and the common people to where the  decaying fish lay. In this test, too, Carancal was the only successful  one. Again he refused to marry; but as the princess was very anxious to  have a strong man for her husband, Tunkodbola was chosen by Carancal,  and he became her husband.    The fame of the strong men was now nearly universal. All the  surrounding kings sent congratulations. The heroes received offers  of marriage from many beautiful ladies of the neighboring kingdoms.    One day when Carancal and Macabuhalbundok were talking together, one  of them suggested that they go on another journey. The other agreed,  and both of them made preparations. But when they were about to start,  a letter from another king came, addressed to Carancal. The king  said in his letter that a great stone had fallen in his park. \"It  is so big that I thought it was the sky that fell,\" he wrote. \"I am  willing to marry you to my youngest daughter if you can remove it  from its present place,\" said the king.    The two friends accepted the invitation, and immediately began their  journey. They travelled by land and sea for many a day. At last  they reached the place. There they found the same stone which they  had removed before. As he knew that he could not move it far enough,  Macabuhalbundok did not make any attempt: Carancal was again the one  who did the work.    Once more Carancal refused to marry. \"I am too young yet to marry,\"  he said to the king. \"In my place I will put my companion.\" So  Macabuhalbundok was married.    Carancal remained a bachelor, for he did not wish to have a wife. The  three princes considered him as their father, though he was younger  than any of them. For a long time Carancal lived with each of them  a year in rotation. Not long after the marriage of Macabuhalbundok,  the father-in-law of Bugtongpalasan died, and so Bugtongpalasan became  the king. Then the following year Tunkodbola's father-in-law died, and  Tunkodbola became also a king. After many years the father-in-law of  Macabuhalbundok died, and Macabuhalbundok succeeded to the throne. Thus  Carancal was the benefactor of three kings.    One day Carancal thought of visiting his cruel parents and of living  with them. So he set out, carrying with him plenty of money, which  the three kings had given him. This time his parents did not drive  him away, for he had much wealth. Carancal lived once more with his  parents, and had three kings under him.      Notes.    Of this story I have eight variants, as follows:--          (a) \"Pusong\" (Visayan), narrated by Fermin Torralba.      (b) \"Cabagboc\" (Bicol), narrated by Pacifico Buenconsejo.

He early develops an enormous appetite, and by the  time he is twelve years old he has eaten his parents out of everything.    B Attempts of parents (or uncle) to get rid of the hero: (B1) by  letting a tree fall on him, (B2) by throwing him into a deep well and  then stoning him, (B3) by commanding him to dive into a river to repair  a fishing-net, (B4) by persuading him to enter wrestling-match with  the king's champion, (B5) by pushing him into the sea or by pushing  rocks on him at the seashore.    C Hero's first exploits: (C1) carrying tree home on his shoulders,  (C2) killing crocodile in river, or king of fishes in the sea, (C3)  escape from the well, (C4) defeating champion.    D The hero now decides to leave home, (D1) taking with him a strong  club, an enormous bolo, or an enormous top, sword, and sheath.    E On his travels he meets two (three) strong men, whom he surpasses  in strength-tests; or (E1) three men, whom he hires. They all journey  along together, seeking adventures.    F Tasks of the companions: (F1) killing of troublesome giant by  the hero after the monster has worsted the two other strong men,  (F2) removal of large stone from king's grounds, (F3) removal of  enormous decaying fish, (F4) killing of two giants, (F5) killing  seven-headed man, (F6) battering, blowing, and running contest with  king's strong men.    G Hero marries off his companions, but remains single himself, and  (G1) returns home to live with his parents, either for good or for  only a short time.

Telamon of the strong spear slew Basileus. And  Idas slew Promeus, and Clytius Hyacinthus, and the two sons of Tyndareus  slew Megalossaces and Phlogius. And after them the son of Oeneus slew  bold Itomeneus, and Artaceus, leader of men; all of whom the inhabitants  still honour with the worship due to heroes. And the rest gave way and  fled in terror just as doves fly in terror before swift-winged hawks.  And with a din they rustled in a body to the gates; and quickly the city  was filled with loud cries at the turning of the dolorous fight. But at  dawn both sides perceived the fatal and cureless error; and bitter grief  seized the Minyan heroes when they saw before them Cyzicus son of Aeneus  fallen in the midst of dust and blood. And for three whole days they  lamented and rent their hair, they and the Dollones. Then three times  round his tomb they paced in armour of bronze and performed funeral  rites and celebrated games, as was meet, upon the meadow-plain, where  even now rises the mound of his grave to be seen by men of a later day.  No, nor was his bride Cleite left behind her dead husband, but to crown  the ill she wrought an ill yet more awful, when she clasped a noose  round her neck. Her death even the nymphs of the grove bewailed; and  of all the tears for her that they shed to earth from their eyes  the goddesses made a fountain, which they call Cleite, [1107] the  illustrious name of the hapless maid. Most terrible came that day from  Zeus upon the Doliones, women and men; for no one of them dared even to  taste food, nor for a long time by reason of grief did they take thought  for the toil of the cornmill, but they dragged on their lives eating  their food as it was, untouched by fire. Here even now, when the Ionians  that dwell in Cyzicus pour their yearly libations for the dead, they  ever grind the meal for the sacrificial cakes at the common mill. [1108]    (ll. 1079-1091) After this, fierce tempests arose for twelve days and  nights together and kept them there from sailing. But in the next night  the rest of the chieftains, overcome by sleep, were resting during the  latest period of the night, while Acastus and Mopsus the son of Ampyeus  kept guard over their deep slumbers. And above the golden head of  Aeson's son there hovered a halcyon prophesying with shrill voice the  ceasing of the stormy winds; and Mopsus heard and understood the cry of  the bird of the shore, fraught with good omen. And some god made it turn  aside, and flying aloft it settled upon the stern-ornament of the ship.  And the seer touched Jason as he lay wrapped in soft sheepskins and woke  him at once, and thus spake:    (ll. 1092-1102) \"Son of Aeson, thou must climb to this temple on rugged  Dindymum and propitiate the mother [1109] of all the blessed gods on her  fair throne, and the stormy blasts shall cease. For such was the voice I  heard but now from the halcyon, bird of the sea, which, as it flew above  thee in thy slumber, told me all. For by her power the winds and the sea  and all the earth below and the snowy seat of Olympus are complete;  and to her, when from the mountains she ascends the mighty heaven, Zeus  himself, the son of Cronos, gives place. In like manner the rest of the  immortal blessed ones reverence the dread goddess.\"    (ll. 1103-1152) Thus he spake, and his words were welcome to Jason's  ear. And he arose from his bed with joy and woke all his comrades  hurriedly and told them the prophecy of Mopsus the son of Ampycus. And  quickly the younger men drove oxen from their stalls and began to lead  them to the mountain's lofty summit. And they loosed the hawsers from  the sacred rock and rowed to the Thracian harbour; and the heroes  climbed the mountain, leaving a few of their comrades in the ship.  And to them the Macrian heights and all the coast of Thrace opposite  appeared to view close at hand. And there appeared the misty mouth of  Bosporus and the Mysian hills; and on the other side the stream of the  river Aesepus and the city and Nepeian plain of Adrasteia. Now there was  a sturdy stump of vine that grew in the forest, a tree exceeding old;  this they cut down, to be the sacred image of the mountain goddess;  and Argus smoothed it skilfully, and they set it upon that rugged hill  beneath a canopy of lofty oaks, which of all trees have their roots  deepest. And near it they heaped an altar of small stones, and wreathed  their brows with oak leaves and paid heed to sacrifice, invoking the  mother of Dindymum, most venerable, dweller in Phrygia, and Titias and  Cyllenus, who alone of many are called dispensers of doom and assessors  of the Idaean mother,--the Idaean Dactyls of Crete, whom once the nymph  Anchiale, as she grasped with both hands the land of Oaxus, bare in the  Dictaean cave. And with many prayers did Aeson's son beseech the goddess  to turn aside the stormy blasts as he poured libations on the blazing  sacrifice; and at the same time by command of Orpheus the youths trod a  measure dancing in full armour, and clashed with their swords on their  shields, so that the ill-omened cry might be lost in the air the wail  which the people were still sending up in grief for their king. Hence  from that time forward the Phrygians propitiate Rhea with the wheel and  the drum. And the gracious goddess, I ween, inclined her heart to pious  sacrifices; and favourable signs appeared. The trees shed abundant  fruit, and round their feet the earth of its own accord put forth  flowers from the tender grass. And the beasts of the wild wood left  their lairs and thickets and came up fawning on them with their tails.  And she caused yet another marvel; for hitherto there was no flow of  water on Dindymum, but then for them an unceasing stream gushed forth  from the thirsty peak just as it was, and the dwellers around in after  times called that stream, the spring of Jason. And then they made  a feast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, singing the  praises of Rhea most venerable; but at dawn the winds had ceased and  they rowed away from the island.    (ll. 1153-1171) Thereupon a spirit of contention stirred each chieftain,  who should be the last to leave his oar. For all around the windless  air smoothed the swirling waves and lulled the sea to rest. And they,  trusting in the calm, mightily drove the ship forward; and as she sped  through the salt sea, not even the storm-footed steeds of Poseidon would  have overtaken her. Nevertheless when the sea was stirred by violent  blasts which were just rising from the rivers about evening, forspent  with toil, they ceased. But Heracles by the might of his arms pulled the  weary rowers along all together, and made the strong-knit timbers of  the ship to quiver. But when, eager to reach the Mysian mainland, they  passed along in sight of the mouth of Rhyndaeus and the great cairn of  Aegaeon, a little way from Phrygia, then Heracles, as he ploughed up  the furrows of the roughened surge, broke his oar in the middle. And one  half he held in both his hands as he fell sideways, the other the sea  swept away with its receding wave. And he sat up in silence glaring  round; for his hands were unaccustomed to be idle.    (ll. 1172-1186) Now at the hour when from the field some delver or  ploughman goes gladly home to his hut, longing for his evening meal, and  there on the threshold, all squalid with dust, bows his wearied knees,  and, beholding his hands worn with toil, with many a curse reviles his  belly; at that hour the heroes reached the homes of the Cianian land  near the Arganthonian mount and the outfall of Cius. Them as they came  in friendliness, the Mysians, inhabitants of that land, hospitably  welcomed, and gave them in their need provisions and sheep and abundant  wine. Hereupon some brought dried wood, others from the meadows leaves  for beds which they gathered in abundance for strewing, whilst others  were twirling sticks to get fire; others again were mixing wine in  the bowl and making ready the feast, after sacrificing at nightfall to  Apollo Ecbasius.    (ll. 1187-1206) But the son of Zeus having duly enjoined on his comrades  to prepare the feast took his way into a wood, that he might first  fashion for himself an oar to fit his hand. Wandering about he found a  pine not burdened with many branches, nor too full of leaves, but  like to the shaft of a tall poplar; so great was it both in length  and thickness to look at. And quickly he laid on the ground his  arrow-holding quiver together with his bow, and took off his lion's  skin. And he loosened the pine from the ground with his bronze-tipped  club and grasped the trunk with both hands at the bottom, relying on his  strength; and he pressed it against his broad shoulder with legs wide  apart; and clinging close he raised it from the ground deep-rooted  though it was, together with clods of earth. And as when unexpectedly,  just at the time of the stormy setting of baleful Orion, a swift gust of  wind strikes down from above, and wrenches a ship's mast from its stays,  wedges and all; so did Heracles lift the pine. And at the same time he  took up his bow and arrows, his lion skin and club, and started on his  return.    (ll. 1207-1239) Meantime Hylas with pitcher of bronze in hand had gone  apart from the throng, seeking the sacred flow of a fountain, that he  might be quick in drawing water for the evening meal and actively make  all things ready in due order against his lord's return. For in such  ways did Heracles nurture him from his first childhood when he had  carried him off from the house of his father, goodly Theiodamas, whom  the hero pitilessly slew among the Dryopians because he withstood him  about an ox for the plough. Theiodamas was cleaving with his plough the  soil of fallow land when he was smitten with the curse; and Heracles  bade him give up the ploughing ox against his"]]]
