How shall I describe their feelings  as exposed to all the personal indignities, which lawless appetite or  brutal passion may suggest? How shall I exhibit their sufferings as  determining to refuse sustenance and die, or as resolving to break their  chains, and, disdaining to live as slaves, to punish their oppressors?  How shall I give an idea of their agony when under various punishments  and tortures for their reputed crimes? Indeed, every part of this  subject defies my powers, and I must, therefore, satisfy myself and the  reader with a general representation, or in the words of a celebrated  member of Parliament, that \"Never was so much human suffering condensed  in so small a space.\"    I come now to the evil, as it has been proved to arise in the third  case; or to consider the situation of the unhappy victims of the trade,  when their painful voyages are over, or after they have been landed upon  their destined shores. And here we are to view them, first under the  degrading light of cattle: we are to see them examined, handled,  selected, separated, and sold. Alas! relatives are separated from  relatives, as if, like cattle, they had no rational intellect, no power  of feeling the nearness of relationship, nor sense of the duties  belonging to the ties of life! We are next to see them labouring; and  this for the benefit of those to whom they are under no obligation, by  any law either natural or divine, to obey. We are to see them, if  refusing the commands of their purchasers, however weary, or feeble, or  indisposed, subject to corporal punishments, and if forcibly resisting  them to death: we are to see them in a state of general degradation and  misery. The knowledge which their oppressors have of their own crime, in  having violated the rights of nature, and of the disposition of the  injured to seek all opportunities of revenge, produces a fear which  dictates to them the necessity of a system of treatment, by which they  shall keep up a wide distinction between the two, and by which the noble  feelings of the latter shall be kept down, and their spirits broken. We  are to see them again subject to individual persecution, as anger, or  malice, or any bad passion may suggest: hence the whip, the chain, the  iron-collar! hence the various modes of private torture, of which so  many accounts have been truly given. Nor can such horrible cruelties be  discovered so as to be made punishable, while the testimony of any  number of the oppressed is invalid against the oppressors, however they  may be offences against the laws. And, lastly, we are to see their  innocent offspring, against whose personal liberty the shadow of an  argument cannot be advanced, inheriting all the miseries of their  parents' lot.    The evil then, as far as it has been hitherto viewed, presents to us, in  its three several departments, a measure of human suffering not to be  equalled--not to be calculated--not to be described. But would that we  could consider this part of the subject as dismissed! would that in each  of the departments now examined there was no counterpart left us to  contemplate! But this cannot be; for if there be persons who suffer  unjustly there must be others who oppress: and if there be those who  oppress, there must be to the suffering, which has been occasioned, a  corresponding portion of immorality or guilt.    We are obliged then to view the counterpart of the evil in question,  before we can make a proper estimate of the nature of it. And, in  examining this part of it, we shall find that we have a no less  frightful picture to behold than in the former cases; or that, while the  miseries endured by the unfortunate Africans excite our pity on the one  hand, the vices, which are connected with them, provoke our indignation  and abhorrence on the other. The Slave Trade, in this point of view,  must strike us as an immense mass of evil on account of the criminality  attached to it, as displayed in the various branches of it, which have  already been examined. For, to take the counterpart of the evil in the  first of these, can we say that no moral turpitude is to be placed to  the account of those, who, living on the continent of Africa, give birth  to the enormities, which take place in consequence of the prosecution of  this trade? Is not that man made morally worse, who is induced to become  a tiger to his species, or who, instigated by avarice, lies in wait in  the thicket to get possession of his fellow-man? Is no injustice  manifest in the land, where the prince, unfaithful to his duty, seizes  his innocent subjects, and sells them for slaves? Are no moral evils  produced among those communities, which make war upon other communities  for the sake of plunder, and without any previous provocation or  offence? Does no crime attach to those, who accuse others falsely, or  who multiply and divide crimes for the sake of the profit of the  punishment, and who for the same reason continue the use of barbarous  and absurd ordeals as a test of innocence or guilt?    In the second of these branches, the counterpart of the evil is to be  seen in the conduct of those who purchase the miserable natives in their  own country, and convey them to distant lands. And here questions,  similar to the former, may be asked. Do they experience no corruption of  their nature, or become chargeable with no violation of right, who, when  they go with their ships to this continent, know the enormities which  their visits there will occasion, who buy their fellow-creature man, and  this, knowing the way in which he comes into their hands, and who chain,  and imprison, and scourge him? Do the moral feelings of those persons  escape without injury, whose hearts are hardened? And can the hearts of  those be otherwise than hardened, who are familiar with the tears and  groans of innocent strangers forcibly torn away from every thing that is  dear to them in life, who are accustomed to see them on board their  vessels in a state of suffocation and in the agonies of despair, and who  are themselves in the habit of the cruel use of arbitrary power?    The counterpart of the evil in its third branch is to be seen in the  conduct of those, who, when these miserable people have been landed,  purchase and carry them to their respective homes. And let us see  whether a mass of wickedness is not generated also in the present case.  Can those have nothing to answer for, who separate the faithful ties  which nature and religion have created? Can their feelings be otherwise  than corrupted, who consider their fellow-creatures as brutes, or treat  those as cattle, who may become the temples of the Holy Spirit, and in  whom the Divinity disdains not himself to dwell? Is there no injustice  in forcing men to labour without wages? Is there no breach of duty, when  we are commanded to clothe the naked, and feed the hungry, and visit the  sick and in prison, in exposing them to want, in torturing them by cruel  punishment, and in grinding them down by hard labour, so as to shorten  their days? Is there no crime in adopting a system, which keeps down all  the noble faculties of their souls, and which positively debases and  corrupts their nature? Is there no crime in perpetuating these evils  among their innocent offspring? And finally, besides all these crimes,  is there not naturally in the familiar sight of the exercise, but more  especially in the exercise itself, of uncontrolled power, that which  vitiates the internal man? In seeing misery stalk daily over the land,  do not all become insensibly hardened? By giving birth to that misery  themselves, do they not become abandoned? In what state of society are  the corrupt appetites so easily, so quickly, and so frequently indulged,  and where else, by means of frequent indulgence, do these experience  such a monstrous growth? Where else is the temper subject to such  frequent irritation, or passion to such little control? Yes--if the  unhappy slave is in an unfortunate situation, so is the tyrant who holds  him. Action and reaction are equal to each other, as well in the moral  as in the natural world. You cannot exercise an improper dominion over a  fellow-creature, but by a wise ordering of Providence you must  necessarily injure yourself.    Having now considered the nature of the evil of the Slave Trade in its  three separate departments of suffering, and in its corresponding  counterparts of guilt, I shall make a few observations on the extent of  it.    On this subject it must strike us, that the misery and the crimes  included in the evil, as it has been found in Africa, were not like  common maladies, which make a short or periodical visit and then are  gone, but that they were continued daily. Nor were they like diseases,  which from local causes attack a village or a town, and by the skill of  the physician, under the blessing of Providence, are removed; but they  affected a whole continent. The trade with all its horrors began at the  river Senegal, and continued, winding with the coast, through its  several geographical divisions to Cape Negro; a distance of more than  three thousand miles. In various lines or paths formed at right angles  from the shore, and passing into the heart of the country, slaves were  procured and brought down. The distance, which many of them travelled,  was immense. Those, who have been in Africa, have assured us, that they  came as far as from the sources of their largest rivers, which we know  to be many hundred miles inland, and the natives have told us, in their  way of computation, that they came a journey of many moons.    It must strike us again, that the misery and the crimes, included in the  evil, as it has been shown in the transportation, had no ordinary  bounds. They were not to be seen in the crossing of a river, but of an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10635"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"him by the fountain, on  a marble cirque which it had; and then he wept in concert with him  heartily, and asked his pardon, and so baptised him in the water of the  fountain, and knelt and prayed to God for him with joined hands.    He then paused and looked at him; and when he perceived his countenance  changed, and that his whole person was cold, he left him there on the  marble cirque by the fountain, all armed as he was, with the sword by his  side, and the crown upon his head.           *       *       *       *       *    I think I may anticipate the warm admiration of the reader for the whole  of this beautiful episode, particularly its close. \"I think,\" says  Panizzi, \"that Tasso had this passage particularly in view when he wrote  the duel of Clorinda and Tancredi, and her conversion and baptism before  dying. The whole passage, from stanza xii. (where Agrican receives his  mortal blow) to this, is beautiful; and the delicate proceeding of  Orlando in leaving Agrican's body armed, even with the sword in his hand,  is in the noblest spirit of chivalry.\"--Edition of _Boiardo and Ariosto_,  vol. iii. page 357.    The reader will find the original in the Appendix No. I.    In the course of the poem (canto xix. stanza xxvi.) a knight, with the  same noble delicacy, who is in distress for a set of arms, borrows those  belonging to the dead body, with many excuses, and a kiss on its face.

A FAIRY LOVE-TALE    Argument.    Prasildo, a nobleman of Babylon, to his great anguish, falls in love with  his friend's wife, Tisbina; and being overheard by her and her husband  threatening to kill himself, the lady, hoping to divert him from his  passion by time and absence, promises to return it on condition of his  performing a distant and perilous adventure. He performs the adventure;  and the husband and wife, supposing that there is no other way of her  escaping the consequences, resolve to take poison; after which the lady  goes to Prasildo's house, and informs him of their having done so.  Prasildo resolves to die with them; but hearing, in the mean time, that  the apothecary had given them a drink that was harmless, he goes and  tells them of their good fortune; upon which the husband is so struck  with his generosity, that he voluntarily quits Babylon for life and the  lady marries the lover. The new husband subsequently hears that his  friend's life is in danger, and quits the wife to go and deliver him from  it at the risk of his own, which he does.    This story, which has resemblances to it in Boccaccio and Chaucer, is  told to Rinaldo while riding through a wood in Asia, with a damsel behind  him on the same horse. He has engaged to combat in her behalf with a band  of knights; and the lady relates it to beguile the way.    The reader is to bear in mind, that the age of chivalry took delight in  mooting points of love and friendship, such as in after-times would  have been out of the question; and that the parties in this story are  Mahometans, with whom divorce was an easy thing, and caused no scandal.    THE SARACEN FRIENDS.    Iroldo, a knight of Babylon, had to wife a lady of the name of Tisbina,  whom he loved with a passion equal to that of Tristan for Iseult;[1] and  she returned his love with such fondness, that her thoughts were occupied  with him from morning till night. Among other pleasant circumstances  of their position, they had a neighbour who was accounted the greatest  nobleman in the city; and he deserved his credit, for he spent his great  riches in doing nothing but honour to his rank. He was pleasant in  company, formidable in battle, full of grace in love; an open-hearted,  accomplished gentleman.    This personage, whose name was Prasildo, happened to be of a party one  day with Tisbina, who were amusing themselves in a garden, with a game in  which the players knelt down with their faces bent on one another's laps,  and guessed who it was that struck them. The turn came to himself, and  he knelt down to the lap of Tisbina; but no sooner was he there, than he  experienced feelings he had never dreamt of; and instead of trying to  guess correctly, took all the pains he could to remain in the same  position.    These feelings pursued him all the rest of the day, and still more  closely at night. He did nothing but think and sigh, and find the soft  feathers harder than any stone. Nor did he get better as time advanced.  His once favourite pastime of hunting now ceased to afford him any  delight. Nothing pleased him but to be giving dinners and balls, to make  verses and sing them to his lute, and to joust and tournay in the eyes of  his love, dressed in the most sumptuous apparel. But above all, gentle  and graceful as he had been before, he now became still more gentle and  graceful--for good qualities are always increased when a man is in  love. Never in my life did I know them turn to ill in that case. So, in  Prasildo's, you may guess what a super-excellent person he became.    The passion which had thus taken possession of this gentleman was not  lost upon the lady for want of her knowing it. A mutual acquaintance  was always talking to her on the subject, but to no purpose; she never  relaxed her pride and dignity for a moment. The lover at last fell ill;  he fairly wasted away; and was so unhappy, that he gave up all his  feastings and entertainments. The only pleasure he took was in a solitary  wood, in which he used to plunge himself in order to give way to his  grief and lamentations.    It happened one day, early in the morning, while he was thus occupied,  that Iroldo came into the wood to amuse himself with bird-catching. He  had Tisbina with him; and as they were coming along, they overheard their  neighbour during one of his paroxysms, and stopped to listen to what he  said.    \"Hear me,\" exclaimed he, \"ye flowers and ye woods. Hear to what a pass of  wretchedness I am come, since that cruel one will hear me not. Hear, O  sun that hast taken away the night from the heavens, and you, ye stars,  and thou the departing moon, hear the voice of my grief for the last  time, for exist I can no longer; my death is the only way left me to  gratify that proud beauty, to whom it has pleased Heaven to give a  cruel heart with a merciful countenance. Fain would I have died in her  presence. It would have comforted me to see her pleased even with that  proof of my love. But I pray, nevertheless, that she may never know it;  since, cruel as she is, she might blame herself for having shewn a scorn  so extreme; and I love her so, I would not have her pained for all her  cruelty. Surely I shall love her even in my grave.\"    With these words, turning pale with his own mortal resolution, Prasildo  drew his sword, and pronouncing the name of Tisbina more than once with a  loving voice, as though its very sound would be sufficient to waft him  to Paradise, was about to plunge the steel into his bosom, when the lady  herself, by leave of her husband, whose manly visage was all in tears for  pity, stood suddenly before him.    \"Prasildo,\" said she, \"if you love me, listen to me. You have often told  me that you do so. Now prove it. I happen to be threatened with nothing  less than the loss of life and honour. Nothing short of such a calamity  could have induced me to beg of you the service I am going to request;  since there is no greater shame in the world than to ask favours from  those to whom we have refused them. But I now promise you, that if you do  what I desire, your love shall be returned. I give you my word for it. I  give you my honour. On the other side of the wilds of Barbary is a garden  which has a wall of iron. It has four gates. Life itself keeps one; Death  another; Poverty the third; the fairy of Riches the fourth. He who goes  in at one gate must go out at the other opposite; and in the midst of the  garden is a tree, tall as the reach of an arrow, which produces pearls  for blossoms. It is called the Tree of Wealth, and has fruit of emeralds  and boughs of gold. I must have a bough of that tree, or suffer the most  painful consequences. Now, then, if you love me, I say, prove it. Prove  it, and most assuredly I shall love you in turn, better than ever you  loved myself.\"    What need of saying that Prasildo, with haste and joy, undertook to do  all that she required? If she had asked the sun and stars, and the whole  universe, he would have promised them. Quitting her in spite of his love,  he set out on the journey without delay, only dressing himself before he  left the city in the habit of a pilgrim.    Now you must know, that Iroldo and his lady had set Prasildo on that  adventure, in the hope that the great distance which he would have to  travel, and the change which it might assist time to produce, would  deliver him from his passion. At all events, in case this good end was  not effected before he arrived at the garden, they counted to a certainty  on his getting rid of it when he did; because the fairy of that garden,  which was called the Garden of Medusa, was of such a nature, that  whosoever did but look on her countenance forgot the reason for his going  thither; and whoever saluted, touched, and sat down to converse by her  side, forgot all that had ever occurred in his lifetime.    Away, however, on his steed went our bold lover; all alone, or rather  with Love for his companion; and so, riding hard till he came to the Red  Sea, he took ship, and"]]]
