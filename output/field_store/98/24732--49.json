Plautus, Moliere, and Dryden  have all taken this plot for a comedy entitled _Amphitryon_.    ALCOFRI'BAS, the name by which Rabelais was called, after he came out  of the prince's mouth, where he resided for six months, taking toll of  every morsel of food that the prince ate. Pantag'ruel gave \"the merry  fellow the lairdship of Salmigondin.\"--Rabelais, _Pantagruel_, ii. 32  (1533).    AL'COLOMB, \"subduer of hearts,\" daughter of Abou Aibou of Damascus,  and sister of Ganem. The caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, in a fit of  jealousy, commanded Ganem to be put to death, and his mother and  sister to do penance for three days in Damascus, and then to be  banished from Syria. The two ladies came to Bag dad, and were taken in  by the charitable syndic of the jewellers. When the jealous fit of the  caliph was over he sent for the two exiles. Alcolomb he made his wife,  and her mother he married to his vizier.--_Arabian Nights_ (\"Ganem,  the Slave of Love \").    ALCY'ON \"the wofullest man alive,\" but once \"the jolly shepherd swain  that wont full merrily to pipe and dance,\" near where the Severn  flows. One day he saw a lion's cub, and brought it up till it followed  him about like a dog; but a cruel satyr shot it in mere wantonness. By  the lion's cub he means Daphne, who died in her prime, and the cruel  satyr is death. He said he hated everything--the heaven, the earth,  fire, air, and sea, the day, the night; he hated to speak, to hear, to  taste food, to see objects, to smell, to feel; he hated man and woman  too, for his Daphne lived no longer. What became of this doleful  shepherd the poet could never ween. Alcyon is sir Arthur  Gorges.--Spencer, _Daphnaida_ (in seven fyttes, 1590).      And there is that Alcyon bent to mourn,    Though fit to frame an everlasting ditty.    Whose gentle sprite for Daphne's death doth turn    Sweet lays of love to endless plaints of pity.    Spenser, _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_ (1591).    ALCY'ONE or HALCYONE (4 _syl_.), daughter of Aeolus, who, on hearing  of her husband's death by shipwreck, threw herself into the sea, and  was changed to a kingfisher. (See HALCYON DAYS.)    ALDABEL'LA, wife of Orlando, sister of Oliver, and daughter of  Monodan'tes.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso, etc_. (1516).    _Aldabella_, a marchioness of Florence, very beautiful and  fascinating, but arrogant and heartless. She used to give  entertainments to the magnates of Florence, and Fazio was one who  spent most of his time in her society. Bian'ca his wife, being jealous  of the marchioness, accused him to the duke of being privy to the  death of Bartoldo, and for this offence Fazio was executed. Bianca  died broken-hearted, and Aldabella was condemned to spend the rest of  her life in a nunnery.--Dean Milman, _Fazio_ (a tragedy, 1815).    ALDEN (_John_), one of the sons of the Pilgrim fathers, in love with  Priscilla, the beautiful puritan. Miles Standish, a bluff old soldier,  wishing to marry Priscilla, asked John Alden to go and plead for him;  but the maiden answered archly, \"Why don't you speak for yourself,  John!\" Soon after this, Standish being reported killed by a poisoned  arrow, John spoke for himself, and the maiden consented. Standish,  however, was not killed, but only wounded; he made his reappearance  at the wedding, where, seeing how matters stood, he accepted the  situation with the good-natured remark:      If you would be served you must serve yourself;    and moreover    No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season    of Christmas.    Longfellow, _Courtship of Miles Standish_ (1858).    ALDIBORONTEPHOSCOPHORNIO _[Al'diboron'te-fos'co-for'nio]_, a character  in _Chrononhotonthologos_, by H. Carey.    (Sir Walter Scott used to call James Ballantyne, the printer, this  nickname, from his pomposity and formality of speech.)    AL'DIGER, son of Buo'vo, of the house of Clarmont, brother of  Malagi'gi and Vivian.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    AL'DINE (2 _syl_.), leader of the second squadron of Arabs which  joined the Egyptian armament against the crusaders. Tasso says of  the Arabs, \"Their accents were female and their stature diminutive\"  (xvii.).--Tasso, _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).    AL'DINGAR _(Sir)_, steward of queen Eleanor, wife of Henry II. He  impeached the queen's fidelity, and agreed to prove his charge  by single combat; but an angel (in the shape of a little child)  established the queen's innocence. This is probably a blundering  version of the story of Gunhilda and the emperor Henry.--Percy,  _Reliques_, ii. 9.    ALDO, a Caledonian, was not invited by Fingal to his banquet on his  return to Morven, after the overthrow of Swaran. To resent this  affront, he went over to Fingal's avowed enemy, Erragon king of Sora  (in Scandinavia), and here Lorma, the king's wife, fell in love  with him. The guilty pair fled to Morven, which Erragon immediately  invaded. Aldo fell in single combat with Erragon, Lorma died of grief,  and Erragon was slain in battle by Graul, son of Morni.--_Ossian_  (\"The Battle of Lora\").    ALDRICK the Jesuit, confessor of Charlotte countess of Derby.--Sir W.  Scott, _Peveril of the Peak_ (time, Charles II.).

ALDUS, father of Al'adine (3 _syl_), the \"lusty knight.\"--Spenser,  _Faery Queen_, vi. 3 (1596).    ALEA, a warrior who invented dice at the siege of Troy; at least so  Isidore of Seville says. Suidas ascribes the invention to Palamedes.    Alea est ludus tabulae inventa a Graecis, in otio Trojani belli, a  quodam milite, nomine ALEA, a quo et ars nomen accepit.--Isidorus,  _Orig_. xviii. 57.    ALEC'TRYON, a youth set by Mars to guard against surprises, but he  fell asleep, and Apollo thus surprised Mars and Venus in each others'  embrace. Mars in anger changed the boy into a cock.      And from out the neighboring farmyard    Loud the cock Alectryon crowed.    Longfellow, _Pegasus in Pound_.    ALEC YEATON, the Gloucester skipper in T. B. Aldrich's ballad, _Alec  Yeaton's Son_.      The wind it wailed, the wind it moaned,    And the white caps flecked the sea;    \"An' I would to God,\" the skipper groaned,    \"I had not my boy with me!\"           *       *       *       *       *      Long did they marvel in the town    At God His strange decree;    That let the stalwart skipper drown,    And the little child go free. (1890.)    ALE'RIA, one of the Amazons, and the best beloved of the ten wives of  Guido the Savage.--Ariosto, _Orlando Furioso_ (1516).    ALESSANDRO, husband of the Indian girl Ramona, in Helen Hunt Jackson's  novel _Ramona_. The story of the young couple is a series of  oppressions and deceits practised by U. S. officials (1884). ALESSIO,  the young man with whom Lisa was living in concubinage, when Elvi'no  promised to marry her. Elvino made the promise out of pique, because  he thought Ami'na was not faithful to him, but when he discovered his  error he returned to his first love, and left Lisa to marry Alessio,  with whom she had been previously cohabiting.--Bellini's opera, _La  Sonnamlula_ (1831).    ALE'THES (3 _syl_.), an ambassador from Egypt to king Al'adine  (3 _syl_.); subtle, false, deceitful, and full of wiles.--Tasso,  _Jerusalem Delivered_ (1575).    ALEXANDER PATOFF, brother of the young Russian who figures most  prominently in F. Marion Crawford's novel _Paul Patoff_. Alexander's  mysterious disappearance in a mosque leads to suspicions involving  his brother, even the mother of the two brothers accusing Paul of  fratricide (1887).    ALEX. WALTON, physician and suitor of Margaret Kent in _The Story of  Margaret Kent_, by Henry Hayes (Ellen Olney Kirke) (1886).    ALEXANDER THE GREAT, a tragedy by Nathaniel Lee (1678). In French we  have a novel called _Roman d'Alexandre_, by Lambert-li-cors (twelfth  century), and a tragedy by Racine (1665).    _Alexander an Athlete_. Alexander, being asked if he would run a  course at the Olympic games, replied, \"Yes, if my competitors are all  kings.\"    _The Albanian Alexander_, George Castriot _(Scanderbeg_ or _Iscander  beg_, 1404-1467).    _The Persian Alexander_, Sandjar (1117-1158).    _Alexander of the North_, Charles XII. of Sweden (1682-1718).    _Alexander deformed_.      Ammon's great son one shoulder had too high.    Pope, _Prologue to the Satires_, 117.    _Alexander and Homer_. When Alexander invaded Asia Minor, he offered  up sacrifice to Priam, and then went to visit the tomb of Achilles.  Here he exclaimed, \"O most enviable of men, who had Homer to sing thy  deeds!\"    Which made the Eastern conqueror to cry,      \"O fortunate young man! whose virtue found    So brave a trump thy noble deeds to sound.\"    Spenser, _The Ruins of Time_ (1591).    _Alexander and Parme'nio._ When Darius, king of Persia, offered  Alexander his daughter Stati'ra in marriage, with a dowry of 10,000  talents of gold, Parmenio said, \"I would accept the offer, if I  were Alexander.\" To this Alexander rejoined, \"So would I, if I were  Parmenio.\"    On another occasion the general thought the king somewhat too lavish  in his gifts, whereupon Alexander made answer, \"I consider not what  Parmenio ought to receive, but what Alexander ought to give.\"    _Alexander and Perdiccas_. When Alexander started for Asia he divided  his possessions among his friends. Perdiccas asked what he had  left for himself. \"Hope,\" said Alexander. \"If hope is enough for  Alexander,\" replied the friend, \"it is enough for Perdiccas also;\" and  declined to accept anything.    _Alexander and Raphael_. Alexander encountered Raphael in a cave  in the mountain of Kaf, and being asked what he was in search of,  replied, \"The water of immortality.\" Whereupon Raphael gave him a  stone, and told him when he found another of the same weight he would  gain his wish. \"And how long,\" said Alexander, \"have I to live?\" The  angel replied, \"Till"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438"],[0,"The Willows (#9)"],[1,"they could spy  upon the earth, themselves unseen, a point where the veil between had worn  a little thin. As the final result of too long a sojourn here, we should be  carried over the border and deprived of what we called \"our lives,\" yet by  mental, not physical, processes. In that sense, as he said, we should be  the victims of our adventure--a sacrifice.    It took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of his  sensitiveness and powers of resistance. I translated it vaguely into a  personification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with the  horror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our audacious  intrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw it into the  unoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient shrine, some place  where the old gods still held sway, where the emotional forces of former  worshippers still clung, and the ancestral portion of him yielded to the  old pagan spell.    At any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the winds  from coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual agencies were  within reach and aggressive. Never, before or since, have I been so  attacked by indescribable suggestions of a \"beyond region,\" of another  scheme of life, another revolution not parallel to the human. And in the  end our minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and we  should be drawn across the frontier into their world.    Small things testified to the amazing influence of the place, and now in  the silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by the mind.  The very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to distort every  indication: the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying boatman making  signs, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed of its natural  character, and revealed in something of its other aspect--as it existed  across the border to that other region. And this changed aspect I felt was  now not merely to me, but to the race. The whole experience whose verge we  touched was unknown to humanity at all. It was a new order of experience,  and in the true sense of the word unearthly.    \"It's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one's courage to  zero,\" the Swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following my  thoughts. \"Otherwise imagination might count for much. But the paddle, the  canoe, the lessening food--\"    \"Haven't I explained all that once?\" I interrupted viciously.    \"You have,\" he answered dryly; \"you have indeed.\"    He made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the \"plain  determination to provide a victim\"; but, having now arranged my thoughts  better, I recognized that this was simply the cry of his frightened soul  against the knowledge that he was being attacked in a vital part, and that  he would be somehow taken or destroyed. The situation called for a courage  and calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and I have  never before been so clearly conscious of two persons in me--the one that  explained everything, and the other that laughed at such foolish  explanations, yet was horribly afraid.    Meanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the wood pile grew  small. Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darkness  consequently came up very close to our faces. A few feet beyond the circle  of firelight it was inky black. Occasionally a stray puff of wind set the  willows shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome sound a  deep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the gurgling of the  river and the humming in the air overhead.    We both missed, I think, the shouting company of the winds.    At length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though the  wind were about to rise again, I reached the point for me of saturation,  the point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief in plain speech,  or else to betray myself by some hysterical extravagance that must have  been far worse in its effect upon both of us. I kicked the fire into a  blaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. He looked up with a start.    \"I can't disguise it any longer,\" I said; \"I don't like this place, and the  darkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings I get. There's something  here that beats me utterly. I'm in a blue funk, and that's the plain truth.  If the other shore was--different, I swear I'd be inclined to swim for it!\"    The Swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and wind. He  stared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice betrayed his huge  excitement by its unnatural calmness. For the moment, at any rate, he was  the strong man of the two. He was more phlegmatic, for one thing.    \"It's not a physical condition we can escape from by running away,\" he  replied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; \"we must  sit tight and wait. There are forces close here that could kill a herd of  elephants in a second as easily as you or I could squash a fly. Our only  chance is to keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps may save us.\"    I put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words. It  was precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease whose  symptoms had puzzled me.    \"I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they have  not found us--not 'located' us, as the Americans say,\" he went on. \"They're  blundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The paddle and canoe  and provisions prove that. I think they feel us, but cannot actually see  us. We must keep our minds quiet--it's our minds they feel. We must control  our thoughts, or it's all up with us.\"    \"Death, you mean?\" I stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion.    \"Worse--by far,\" he said. \"Death, according to one's belief, means either  annihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but it involves  no change of character. You don't suddenly alter just because the body's  gone. But this means a radical alteration, a complete change, a horrible  loss of oneself by substitution--far worse than death, and not even  annihilation. We happen to have camped in a spot where their region touches  ours, where the veil between has worn thin\"--horrors! he was using my very  own phrase, my actual words--\"so that they are aware of our being in their  neighborhood.\"    \"But who are aware?\" I asked.    I forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the humming  overhead, everything except that I was waiting for an answer that I dreaded  more than I can possibly explain.    He lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over the  fire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes and  look down upon the ground.    \"All my life,\" he said, \"I have been strangely, vividly conscious of  another region--not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet wholly  different in kind--where great things go on unceasingly, where immense and  terrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to which  earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the destinies of empires,  the fate of armies and continents, are all as dust in the balance; vast  purposes, I mean, that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with  more expressions of the soul--\"    \"I suggest just now--\" I began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though I  was face to face with a madman. But he instantly overbore me with his  torrent that had to come.    \"You think,\" he said, \"it is the spirit of the elements, and I thought  perhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now it is--neither. These would  be comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men, depending  upon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who are now about  us have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is mere chance that  their space happens just at this spot to touch our own.\"    The mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as I  listened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set me  shaking a little all over. I found it impossible to control my movements.    \"And what do you propose?\" I began again.    \"A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we could  get away,\" he went on, \"just as the wolves stop to devour the dogs and give  the sleigh another start. But--I see no chance of any other victim now.\"    I stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eye was dreadful. Presently he  continued.          IV      \"It's the willows, of course. The willows mask the others, but the others  are feeling about for us. If we let our minds betray our fear, we're lost,  lost utterly.\" He looked at me with an expression so calm, so determined,  so sincere, that I no longer had any doubts as to his sanity. He was as  sane as any man ever was. \"If we can hold out through the night,\" he added,  \"we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or rather, undiscovered.\"    \"But you really think a sacrifice would--\"    That gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as I spoke, but  it was my friend's scared face that really stopped my mouth.    \"Hush!\" he whispered, holding up his hand. \"Do not mention them more than  you can help. Do not refer to them by name. To name is to reveal; it is the  inevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring them, in order that  they may ignore us.\"    \"Even in thought?\" He was extraordinarily agitated.    \"Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their world. We must  keep them out of our minds at all costs if possible.\"    I raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its own  way. I never longed for the sun as I longed for it then in the awful  blackness of that summer night.    \"Were you awake all last night?\" he went on suddenly.    \"I slept badly a little after dawn,\" I replied evasively, trying to follow"]]]
