Indeed, were I ever to write an essay on the art of wisely \"laying-to,\"  as the sailors say, I would point it by a reference to R. L. Stevenson.  For there is a wise way of \"laying-to\" that does not imply inaction, but  discreet, well-directed effort, against contrary winds and rough seas,  that is, amid obstacles and drawbacks, and even ill-health, where passive  and active may balance and give effect to each other.  Stevenson was by  native instinct and temperament a rover--a lover of adventure, of strange  by-ways, errant tracts (as seen in his _Inland Voyage_ and _Travels with  a Donkey through the Cevennes_--seen yet more, perhaps, in a certain  account of a voyage to America as a steerage passenger), lofty mountain-  tops, with stronger air, and strange and novel surroundings.  He would  fain, like Ulysses, be at home in foreign lands, making acquaintance with  outlying races, with                \"Cities of men,     And manners, climates, councils, governments:     Myself not least, but honoured of them all,     Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\"    If he could not move about as he would, he would invent, make fancy serve  him instead of experience.  We thus owe something to the staying and  restraining forces in him, and a wise \"laying-to\"--for his works, which  are, in large part, finely-healthy, objective, and in almost everything  unlike the work of an invalid, yet, in some degree, were but the devices  to beguile the burdens of an invalid's days.  Instead of remaining in our  climate, it might be, to lie listless and helpless half the day, with no  companion but his own thoughts and fancies (not always so pleasant  either, if, like Frankenstein's monster, or, better still like the imp in  the bottle in the _Arabian Nights_, you cannot, once for all liberate  them, and set them adrift on their own charges to visit other people), he  made a home in the sweeter air and more steady climate of the South  Pacific, where, under the Southern Cross, he could safely and  beneficially be as active as he would be involuntarily idle at home, or  work only under pressure of hampering conditions.  That was surely an  illustration of the true \"laying-to\" with an unaffectedly brave, bright  resolution in it.          CHAPTER VI--SOME EARLIER LETTERS      Carlyle was wont to say that, next to a faithful portrait, familiar  letters were the best medium to reveal a man.  The letters must have been  written with no idea of being used for this end, however--free, artless,  the unstudied self-revealings of mind and heart.  Now, these letters of  R. L. Stevenson, written to his friends in England, have a vast value in  this way--they reveal the man--reveal him in his strength and his  weakness--his ready gift in pleasing and adapting himself to those with  whom he corresponded, and his great power at once of adapting himself to  his circumstances and of humorously rising superior to them.  When he was  ill and almost penniless in San Francisco, he could give Mr Colvin this  account of his daily routine:       \"Any time between eight and half-past nine in the morning a slender     gentleman in an ulster, with a volume buttoned into the breast of it,     maybe observed leaving No. 608 Bush and descending Powell with an     active step.  The gentleman is R. L. Stevenson; the volume relates to     Benjamin Franklin, on whom he meditates one of his charming essays.  He     descends Powell, crosses Market, and descends in Sixth on a branch of     the original Pine Street Coffee-House, no less. . . . He seats himself     at a table covered with waxcloth, and a pampered menial of High-Dutch     extraction, and, indeed, as yet only partially extracted, lays before     him a cup of coffee, a roll, and a pat of butter, all, to quote the     deity, very good.  A while ago, and R. L. Stevenson used to find the     supply of butter insufficient; but he has now learned the art to     exactitude, and butter and roll expire at the same moment.  For this     rejection he pays ten cents, or fivepence sterling (0 pounds 0s. 5d.).       \"Half an hour later, the inhabitants of Bush Street observed the same     slender gentleman armed, like George Washington, with his little     hatchet, splitting kindling, and breaking coal for his fire.  He does     this quasi-publicly upon the window-sill; but this is not to be     attributed to any love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his     prowess with the hatchet (which he persists in calling an axe), and     daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers.  The reason is     this: That the sill is a strong supporting beam, and that blows of the     same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the entire shanty     into hell.  Thenceforth, for from three hours, he is engaged darkly     with an ink-bottle.  Yet he is not blacking his boots, for the only     pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre, and wear the natural     hue of the material turned up with caked and venerable slush.  The     youngest child of his landlady remarks several times a day, as this     strange occupant enters or quits the house, 'Dere's de author.'  Can     it be that this bright-haired innocent has found the true clue to the     mystery?  The being in question is, at least, poor enough to belong to     that honourable craft.\"    Here are a few letters belonging to the winter of 1887-88, nearly all  written from Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks, celebrated by Emerson, and  now a most popular holiday resort in the United States, and were  originally published in _Scribner's Magazine_. . . \"It should be said  that, after his long spell of weakness at Bournemouth, Stevenson had gone  West in search of health among the bleak hill summits--'on the Canadian  border of New York State, very unsettled and primitive and cold.'  He had  made the voyage in an ocean tramp, the _Ludgate Hill_, the sort of craft  which any person not a born child of the sea would shun in horror.  Stevenson, however, had 'the finest time conceivable on board the  \"strange floating menagerie.\"'\"  Thus he describes it in a letter to Mr  Henry James:       \"Stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo; and the vast     continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a haystack; and     the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion, looking through the port     at our dinner-table, and winked when the crockery was broken; and the     little monkeys stared at each other in their cages, and were thrown     overboard like little bluish babies; and the big monkey, Jacko,     scoured about the ship and rested willingly in my arms, to the ruin of     my clothing; and the man of the stallions made a bower of the black     tarpaulin, and sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity, like a     picture on a box of chocolates; and the other passengers, when they     were not sick, looked on and laughed.  Take all this picture, and make     it roll till the bell shall sound unexpected notes and the fittings     shall break loose in our stateroom, and you have the voyage of the     _Ludgate Hill_.  She arrived in the port of New York without beer,     porter, soda-water, curacoa, fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet we     lived, and we regret her.\"    He discovered this that there is no joy in the Universe comparable to  life on a villainous ocean tramp, rolling through a horrible sea in  company with a cargo of cattle.       \"I have got one good thing of my sea voyage; it is proved the sea     agrees heartily with me, and my mother likes it; so if I get any     better, or no worse, my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month or     so in the summer.  Good Lord! what fun!  Wealth is only useful for two     things: a yacht and a string quartette.  For these two I will sell my     soul.  Except for these I hold that 700 pounds a year is as much as     anybody can possibly want; and I have had more, so I know, for the     extra coins were of no use, excepting for illness, which damns     everything.  I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have     believed it possible; we had the beastliest weather, and many     discomforts; but the mere fact of its being a tramp ship gave us many     comforts.  We could cut about with the men and officers, stay in the     wheel-house, discuss all manner of things, and really be a little at     sea.  And truly there is nothing else.  I had literally forgotten what     happiness was, and the full mind--full of external and physical     things, not full of cares and labours, and rot about a fellow's     behaviour.  My heart literally sang; I truly care for nothing so much     as for that.       \"To go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier among the     holiday yachtsmen--that's fame, that's glory--and nobody can take it     away.\"    At Saranac Lake the Stevensons lived in a \"wind-beleaguered hill-top hat-  box of a house,\" which suited the invalid, but, on the other hand,  invalided his wife.  Soon after getting there he plunged into _The Master  of Ballantrae_.       \"No thought have I now apart from it, and I have got along up to page     ninety-two of the draught with great interest.  It is to me a most     seizing tale: there are some fantastic elements, the most is a dead     genuine human problem--human tragedy, I should say rather.  It will be     about as long, I imagine, as _Kidnapped_. . . . I have done most of     the big work, the quarrel, duel between the brothers, and the     announcement of the death to Clementina and my Lord--Clementina,     Henry, and Mackellar (nicknamed Squaretoes) are really very fine     fellows; the Master is all I know of the devil; I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#8)"],[1,"  received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of  wigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the  sentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all against  him, it was because \"Don Quixote\" was what it was; and if the general  public did not come forward to make him comfortable for the rest of his  days, it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the  English-speaking public that did not pay off Scott's liabilities. It did  the best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it, and  encouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others.    It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no  monument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of  him; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las  Cortes, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set  up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not  worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of \"such  weak witness of his name;\" or what could a monument do in his case except  testify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up? Si  monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller's shop will show  what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of \"Don Quixote.\"    Nine editions of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had already appeared  before Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his  own estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his  death. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time, but  by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the  present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and  regularly. The translations show still more clearly in what request the  book has been from the very outset. In seven years from the completion of  the work it had been translated into the four leading languages of  Europe. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been so widely diffused as  \"Don Quixote.\" The \"Imitatio Christi\" may have been translated into as  many different languages, and perhaps \"Robinson Crusoe\" and the \"Vicar of  Wakefield\" into nearly as many, but in multiplicity of translations and  editions \"Don Quixote\" leaves them all far behind.    Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. \"Don  Quixote\" has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about  knight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who had  never seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel  the humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author's purpose.  Another curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the  world, is one of the most intensely national. \"Manon Lescaut\" is not more  thoroughly French, \"Tom Jones\" not more English, \"Rob Roy\" not more  Scotch, than \"Don Quixote\" is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in  sentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret of  this unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh three  centuries? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in the  world, \"Don Quixote\" is the most catholic. There is something in it for  every sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. As  Cervantes himself says with a touch of pride, \"It is thumbed and read and  got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves, the  young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise  it.\"    But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than its  humour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of  human nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude, is  the vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon the sheep,  the battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino's helmet, the balsam of  Fierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill, Sancho  tossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master and man,  that were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are so still to  some extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that \"Don Quixote\"  was generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain for a long time, as  little more than a queer droll book, full of laughable incidents and  absurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to much consideration  or care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to 1771, when the  famous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere trade editions, badly and  carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap-books  intended only for popular use, with, in most instances, uncouth  illustrations and clap-trap additions by the publisher.    To England belongs the credit of having been the first country to  recognise the right of \"Don Quixote\" to better treatment than this. The  London edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret's from having been  suggested by him, was not a mere edition de luxe. It produced \"Don  Quixote\" in becoming form as regards paper and type, and embellished with  plates which, if not particularly happy as illustrations, were at least  well intentioned and well executed, but it also aimed at correctness of  text, a matter to which nobody except the editors of the Valencia and  Brussels editions had given even a passing thought; and for a first  attempt it was fairly successful, for though some of its emendations are  inadmissible, a good many of them have been adopted by all subsequent  editors.    The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a  remarkable change of sentiment with regard to \"Don Quixote.\" A vast  number of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It  became almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour was not  entirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as an  altogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the  stalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot his  philosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for on  this point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the object he  aimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in the  preface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, that he  had no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this, to  advanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have been  something else.    One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth the  eternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit of  poetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy never  evolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its inner  consciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be found in  \"Don Quixote,\" because it is to be found everywhere in life, and  Cervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community in which  the never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and Don  Quixote would not be recognized as true to nature. In the stone age,  among the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don Quixotes and  Sancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see  the facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who could see nothing else.  But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such  idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very  unlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes  himself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort  made by anyone else.    The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is  quite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the  prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth  century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader  bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the  largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is  abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to  grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady  stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to  their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of  their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust.    That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample  provocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who  look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry  itself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,  thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no  greater one than saying that \"Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away.\" In  the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain's  chivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done when  Granada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,  it could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free  institutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was not chivalry  but a degrading mockery of it.    The true nature of the \"right arm\" and the \"bright array,\" before which,  according to the poet, \"the world gave ground,\" and which Cervantes'  single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his own  countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in  his \"Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.\" \"Before the appearance in the  world of that labour of Cervantes,\" he said, \"it was next to an  impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without  danger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before  the windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined the  whole nation to have been nothing less than a race of"]]]
