Mahommed Selim lives; or  lived last quarter of the moon, so says Yusef the ghaffir. Sell your  ten-months' camel, buy the lad out, and bring him back to Soada.\"    \"Saadat!\" said Wassef, in a quick fear, and dropped the stem of the  narghileh, and got to his feet. \"Saadat el basha!\"    \"Before the Nile falls and you may plant yonder field with onions,\"  answered Dicky, jerking his head towards the flooded valley, \"her time  will be come!\"    Wassef's lips were drawn, like shrivelled parchment over his red gums,  the fingers of his right hand fumbled in his robe.    \"There's no one to kill--keep quiet!\" said Dicky, But Wassef saw near  by the faces of the villagers, and on every face he thought he read a  smile, a sneer; though in truth none sneered, for they were afraid of  his terrible anger. Mad with fury he snatched the turban from his head  and threw it on the ground. Then suddenly he gave one cry, \"Allah!\" a  vibrant clack like a pistol-shot, for he saw Yusef, the drunken ghaffir,  coming down the road.    Yusef heard that cry of \"Allah!\" and he knew that the hour had come for  settling old scores. The hashish clouds lifted from his brain, and he  gripped his naboot of the hard wood of the dom-palm, and, with a cry  like a wolf, came on.    It would have been well for Wassef the camel-driver if he had not taken  the turban from his head, for before he could reach Yusef with his  dagger, he went down, his skull cracking like the top of an egg under a  spoon.      III    Thus it was that Soada was left to fight her battle alone. She did not  weep or wail when Wassef's body was brought home and the moghassil and  hanouti came to do their offices. She did not smear her hair with mud,  nor was she moved by the wailing of the mourning women nor the chanters  of the Koran. She only said to Fatima when all was over: \"It is well; he  is gone from my woe to the mercy of God! Praise be to God!\" And she held  her head high in the village still, though her heart was in the dust.    She would have borne her trouble alone to the end, but that she was  bitten on the arm by one of her father's camels the day they were  sold in the marketplace. Then, helpless and suffering and fevered, she  yielded to the thrice-repeated request of Dicky Donovan, and was taken  to the hospital at Assiout, which Fielding Bey, Dicky's friend, had  helped to found.    But Soada, as her time drew near and the terror of it stirred her heart,  cast restless eyes upon the whitewashed walls and rough floors of the  hospital. She longed for the mud hut at Beni Souef, and the smell of the  river and the little field of onions she planted every year. Day by day  she grew harder of heart against those who held her in the hospital--for  to her it was but a prison. She would not look when the doctor came, and  she would not answer, but kept her eyes closed; and she did not shrink  when they dressed the arm so cruelly wounded by the camel's teeth, but  lay still and dumb.    Now, a strange thing happened, for her hair which had been so black  turned brown, and grew browner and browner till it was like the hair of  her mother, who, so the Niline folk said, was descended from the English  soldier-slave with red hair.    Fielding Bey and Dicky came to see her in hospital once before they  returned to Cairo; but Soada would not even speak to them, though she  smiled when they spoke to her; and no one else ever saw her smile during  the days she spent in that hospital with the red floor and white walls  and the lazy watchman walking up and down before the door. She kept her  eyes closed in the daytime; but at night they were always open--always.  Pictures of all she had lived and seen came back to her then--pictures  of days long before Mahommed Selim came into her life. Mahommed Selim!  She never spoke the words now, but whenever she thought them her heart  shrank in pain. Mahommed Selim had gone like a coward into the desert,  leaving her alone.    Her mind dwelt on the little mud hut and the onion field, and she saw  down by the foreshore of the river the great khiassas from Assouan and  Luxor laden with cotton or dourha or sugar-cane, their bent prows hooked  in the Nile mud. She saw again the little fires built along the shore  and atop of the piles of grain, round which sat the white, the black,  and the yellow-robed riverine folk in the crimson glare; while from the  banks came the cry: \"Alla-haly, 'm alla-haly!\" as stalwart young Arabs  drew in from the current to the bank some stubborn, overloaded khiassa.  She heard the snarl of the camels as they knelt down before her father's  but to rest before the journey into the yellow plains of sand beyond.  She saw the seller of sweetmeats go by calling--calling. She heard the  droning of the children in the village school behind the hut, the dull  clatter of Arabic consonants galloping through the Koran. She saw the  moon--the full moon-upon the Nile, the wide acreage of silver water  before the golden-yellow and yellow-purple of the Libyan hills behind.    She saw through her tears the sweet mirage of home, and her heart  rebelled against the prison where she lay. What should she know of  hospitals--she whose medicaments had been herbs got from the Nile valley  and the cool Nile mud? Was it not the will of God if we lived or the  will of God if we died? Did we not all lie in the great mantle of the  mercy of God, ready to be lifted up or to be set down as He willed?  They had prisoned her here; there were bars upon the windows, there were  watchmen at the door.    At last she could bear it no longer; the end of it all came. She stole  out over the bodies of the sleeping watchmen, out into the dusty road  under the palms, down to the waterside, to the Nile--the path leading  homewards. She must go down the Nile, hiding by day, travelling by  night--the homing bird with a broken wing-back to the but where she had  lived so long with Wassef the camel-driver; back where she could lie  in the dusk of her windowless home, shutting out the world from her  solitude. There she could bear the agony of her hour.    Drinking the water of the Nile, eating the crumbs of dourha bread she  had brought from the hospital, getting an onion from a field, chewing  shreds of sugarcane, hiding by day and trudging on by night,  hourly growing weaker, she struggled towards Beni Souef.  Fifty--forty--thirty--ten--five miles! Oh! the last two days, her head  so hot and her brain bursting, and a thousand fancies swimming  before her eyes, her heart fluttering, fluttering--stopping, going  on--stopping, going on.    It was only the sound of the river--the Nile, Mother of Egypt, crooning  to her disordered spirit, which kept her on her feet. Five miles, four  miles, three miles, two, and then--she never quite remembered how she  came to the hut where she was born. Two miles--two hours of incredible  agony, now running, now leaning against a palm tree, now dropping to her  knees, now fighting on and on, she came at last to the one spot in the  world where she could die in peace.    As she staggered, stumbled, through the village, Yusef, the drunken  ghaffir, saw her. He did not dare speak to her, for had he not killed  her father, and had he not bought himself free of punishment from  the Mudir? So he ran to old Fatima and knocked upon her door with his  naboot, crying: \"In the name of Allah get thee to the hut of Wassef the  camel-driver!\"    Thus it was that Soada, in her agony, heard a voice say out of the  infinite distance: \"All praise to Allah, he hath even now the strength  of a year-old child!\"      IV    That night at sunset, as Soada lay upon the sheepskin spread for her,  with the child nestled between her arm and her breast, a figure darkened  the doorway, and old Fatima cried out:    \"Mahommed Selim!\"    With a gasping sound Soada gathered the child quickly to her breast,  and shrank back to the wall. This surely was the ghost of Mahommed  Selim--this gaunt, stooping figure covered with dust.    \"Soada, in the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful, Soada,  beautiful one!\"    Mahommed Selim, once the lithe, the straight, the graceful, now bent,  awkward, fevered, all the old daring gone from him, stood still in the  middle of the room, humbled before the motherhood in his sight.    \"Brother of jackals,\" cried old Fatima, \"what dost thou here? What dost  thou here, dog of dogs!\" She spat at him.    He took no notice. \"Soada,\" he said eagerly, prayerfully, and his voice,  though hoarse, was softer than she had ever heard it. \"Soada, I have  come through death to thee--Listen, Soada! At night, when sleep was upon  the barrack-house, I stole out to come to thee. My heart had been hard.  I had not known how much I loved thee--\"    Soada interrupted him. \"What dost thou know of love, Mahommed Selim? The  blood of the dead cries from the ground.\"    He came a step nearer. \"The blood of Wassef the camel-driver is upon  my head,\" he said. \"In the desert there came news of it. In the desert,  even while we fought the wild tribes, one to ten, a voice kept crying in  my ear, even as thou hast cried, 'What didst thou know of love, Mahommed  Selim!' One by one the men of Beni Souef fell round me; one by one they  spoke of their village and of their women, and begged for a drop of  water, and died. And my heart grew hot within me, and a spirit kept  whispering in my ear: 'Mahommed Selim, think of the village thou hast  shamed, of Soada thou hast wronged! No drop of water shall cheer thy  soul in dying!'\"    Fatima and Soada listened now with bated breath, for this was the voice  of one who had drunk the vinegar and gall of life.    \"When the day was done, and sleep was upon the barrack-house, my heart  waked up and I knew that I loved Soada as I had never loved her.

Good morrow! Good morrow! Good  morrow! Can you not hear me call?\"          CHAPTER V. THE WIDER WAY    Some months later the following letter came to David Claridge in Cairo  from Faith Claridge in Hamley:       David, I write thee from the village and the land of the people     which thou didst once love so well. Does thee love them still?     They gave thee sour bread to eat ere thy going, but yet thee didst     grind the flour for the baking. Thee didst frighten all who knew     thee with thy doings that mad midsummer time. The tavern, the     theatre, the cross-roads, and the cockpit--was ever such a day!       Now, Davy, I must tell of a strange thing. But first, a moment.     Thee remembers the man Kimber smitten by thee at the public-house on     that day? What think thee has happened? He followed to London the     lass kissed by thee, and besought her to return and marry him. This     she refused at first with anger; but afterwards she said that, if in     three years he was of the same mind, and stayed sober and hard-     working meanwhile, she would give him an answer, she would consider.     Her head was high. She has become maid to a lady of degree, who has     well befriended her.       How do I know these things? Even from Jasper Kimber, who, on his     return from London, was taken to his bed with fever. Because of the     hard blows dealt him by thee, I went to make amends. He welcomed     me, and soon opened his whole mind. That mind has generous moments,     David, for he took to being thankful for thy knocks.       Now for the strange thing I hinted. After visiting Jasper Kimber at     Heddington, as I came back over the hill by the path we all took     that day after the Meeting--Ebn Ezra Bey, my father, Elder Fairley,     and thee and me--I drew near the chairmaker's but where thee lived     alone all those sad months. It was late evening; the sun had set.     Yet I felt that I must needs go and lay my hand in love upon the     door of the empty hut which had been ever as thee left it. So I     came down the little path swiftly, and then round the great rock,     and up towards the door. But, as I did so, my heart stood still,     for I heard voices. The door was open, but I could see no one. Yet     there the voices sounded, one sharp and peevish with anger, the     other low and rough. I could not hear what was said. At last, a     figure came from the door and went quickly down the hillside. Who,     think thee, was it? Even \"neighbour Eglington.\" I knew the walk     and the forward thrust of the head. Inside the hut all was still.     I drew near with a kind of fear, but yet I came to the door and     looked in.       As I looked into the dusk, my limbs trembled under me, for who     should be sitting there, a half-finished chair between his knees,     but Soolsby the old chair-maker! Yes, it was he. There he sat     looking at me with his staring blue eyes and shock of redgrey hair.     \"Soolsby! Soolsby!\" said I, my heart hammering at my breast; for     was not Soolsby dead and buried? His eyes stared at me in fright.     \"Why do you come?\" he said in a hoarse whisper. \"Is he dead, then?     Has harm come to him?\"       By now I had recovered myself, for it was no ghost I saw, but a     human being more distraught than was myself. \"Do you not know me,     Soolsby?\" I asked. \"You are Mercy Claridge from beyond--beyond and     away,\" he answered dazedly. \"I am Faith Claridge, Soolsby,\"     answered I. He started, peered forward at me, and for a moment he     did not speak; then the fear went from his face. \"Ay, Faith     Claridge, as I said,\" he answered, with apparent understanding, his     stark mood passing. \"No, thee said Mercy Claridge, Soolsby,\" said     I, \"and she has been asleep these many years.\" \"Ay, she has slept     soundly, thanks be to God!\" he replied, and crossed himself. \"Why     should thee call me by her name?\" I inquired. \"Ay, is not her tomb     in the churchyard?\" he answered, and added quickly, \"Luke Claridge     and I are of an age to a day--which, think you, will go first?\"       He stopped weaving, and peered over at me with his staring blue     eyes, and I felt a sudden quickening of the heart. For, at the     question, curtains seemed to drop from all around me, and leave me     in the midst of pains and miseries, in a chill air that froze me to     the marrow. I saw myself alone--thee in Egypt and I here, and none     of our blood and name beside me. For we are the last, Davy, the     last of the Claridges. But I said coldly, and with what was near to     anger, that he should link his name and fate with that of Luke     Claridge: \"Which of ye two goes first is God's will, and according     to His wisdom. Which, think thee,\" added I--and now I cannot     forgive myself for saying it--\"which, think thee, would do least     harm in going?\" \"I know which would do most good,\" he answered,     with a harsh laugh in his throat. Yet his blue eyes looked kindly     at me, and now he began to nod pleasantly. I thought him a little     mad, but yet his speech had seemed not without dark meaning. \"Thee     has had a visitor,\" I said to him presently. He laughed in a     snarling way that made me shrink, and answered: \"He wanted this and     he wanted that--his high-handed, second-best lordship. Ay, and he     would have it, because it pleased him to have it--like his father     before him. A poor sparrow on a tree-top, if you tell him he must     not have it, he will hunt it down the world till it is his, as     though it was a bird of paradise. And when he's seen it fall at     last, he'll remember but the fun of the chase; and the bird may get     to its tree-top again--if it can--if it can--if it can, my lord!     That is what his father was, the last Earl, and that is what he is     who left my door but now. He came to snatch old Soolsby's palace,     his nest on the hill, to use it for a telescope, or such whimsies.     He has scientific tricks like his father before him. Now is it     astronomy, and now chemistry, and suchlike; and always it is the     Eglington mind, which let God A'mighty make it as a favour. He     would have old Soolsby's palace for his spy-glass, would he then?     It scared him, as though I was the devil himself, to find me here.     I had but come back in time--a day later, and he would have sat here     and seen me in the Pit below before giving way. Possession's nine     points were with me; and here I sat and faced him; and here he     stormed, and would do this and should do that; and I went on with my     work. Then he would buy my Colisyum, and I wouldn't sell it for all     his puffball lordship might offer. Isn't the house of the snail as     much to him as the turtle's shell to the turtle? I'll have no     upstart spilling his chemicals here, or devilling the stars from a     seat on my roof.\" \"Last autumn,\" said I, \"David Claridge was housed     here. Thy palace was a prison then.\" \"I know well of that.     Haven't I found his records here? And do you think his makeshift     lordship did not remind me?\" \"Records? What records, Soolsby?\"     asked I, most curious. \"Writings of his thoughts which he forgot--     food for mind and body left in the cupboard.\" \"Give them to me upon     this instant, Soolsby,\" said I. \"All but one,\" said he, \"and that     is my own, for it was his mind upon Soolsby the drunken chair-maker.     God save him from the heathen sword that slew his uncle. Two better     men never sat upon a chair!\" He placed the papers in my hand, all     save that one which spoke of him. Ah, David, what with the flute     and the pen, banishment was no pain to thee!... He placed the     papers, save that one, in my hands, and I, womanlike, asked again     for all. \"Some day,\" said he, \"come, and I will read it to you.     Nay, I will give you a taste of it now,\" he added, as he brought     forth the writing. \"Thus it reads.\"       Here are thy words, Davy. What think thee of them now?       \"As I dwell in this house I know Soolsby as I never knew him when he     lived, and though, up here, I spent many an hour with him. Men     leave their impressions on all around them. The walls which have     felt their look and their breath, the floor which has taken their     footsteps, the chairs in which they have sat, have something of     their presence. I feel Soolsby here at times so sharply that it     would seem he came again and was in this room, though he is dead and     gone. I ask him how it came he lived here alone; how it came that     he made chairs, he, with brains enough to build great houses or     great bridges; how it was that drink and he were such friends; and     how he, a Catholic, lived here among us Quakers, so singular,     uncompanionable, and severe. I think it true, and sadly true, that     a man with a vice which he is able to satisfy easily and habitually,     even as another satisfies a virtue, may give up the wider actions of     the world and the possibilities of his life for the pleasure which     his one vice gives him, and neither miss nor desire those greater     chances of virtue or ambition which he has lost. The simplicity of     a vice may be as real as the simplicity of a virtue.\"       Ah, David, David, I know not what to think of those strange words;     but old Soolsby seemed well to understand thee, and he called thee     \"a first-best gentleman.\" Is my story long? Well, it was so     strange, and it fixed itself upon my mind so deeply, and thy     writings at the hut have been so much in my hands and in my mind,     that I have put it all down here. When I asked Soolsby how it came     he had been rumoured dead, he said that he himself had been the     cause of it; but for what purpose he would not say, save that he was     going a long voyage, and "]]]
