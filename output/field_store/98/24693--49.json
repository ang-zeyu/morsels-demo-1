Then cling to her;  And say if thou hast found a guest of grace  In God's son, Heracles! Look in her face;  Look; is she like...?    [ADMETUS _looks and stands amazed_.]                         Go, and forget in bliss  Thy sorrow!    ADMETUS.               O ye Gods! What meaneth this?  A marvel beyond dreams! The face ... 'tis she;  Mine, verily mine! Or doth God mock at me  And blast my vision with some mad surmise?    HERACLES.  Not so. This is thy wife before thine eyes.    ADMETUS (_who has recoiled in his amazement_).  Beware! The dead have phantoms that they send...    HERACLES.  Nay; no ghost-raiser hast thou made thy friend.    ADMETUS.  My wife ... she whom I buried?    HERACLES.                                        I deceive  Thee not; nor wonder thou canst scarce believe.    ADMETUS.  And dare I touch her, greet her, as mine own  Wife living?    HERACLES.                Greet her. Thy desire is won.    ADMETUS (_approaching with awe_),  Beloved eyes; beloved form; O thou  Gone beyond hope, I have thee, I hold thee now?    HERACLES.  Thou hast her: may no god begrudge your joy.    ADMETUS (_turning to_ HERACLES).  O lordly conqueror, Child of Zeus on high,  Be blessed! And may He, thy sire above,  Save thee, as thou alone hast saved my love!    [_He kneels to_ HERACLES, _who raises him_.]    But how ... how didst thou win her to the light?    HERACLES.  I fought for life with Him I needs must fight.    ADMETUS.  With Death thou hast fought! But where?    HERACLES.                                        Among his dead  I lay, and sprang and gripped him as he fled.    ADMETUS (_in an awed whisper, looking towards_ ALCESTIS).  Why standeth she so still? No sound, no word!    HERACLES.  She hath dwelt with Death. Her voice may not be heard  Ere to the Lords of Them Below she pay  Due cleansing, and awake on the third day.  (_To the Attendants_) So; guide her home.    [_They lead_ ALCESTIS _to the doorway_.]                                  And thou, King, for the rest  Of time, be true; be righteous to thy guest,  As he would have thee be. But now farewell!  My task yet lies before me, and the spell  That binds me to my master; forth I fare.    ADMETUS.  Stay with us this one day! Stay but to share  The feast upon our hearth!    HERACLES.                              The feasting day  Shall surely come; now I must needs away.    [HERACLES _departs_.]    ADMETUS.  Farewell! All victory attend thy name  And safe home-coming!                            Lo, I make proclaim  To the Four Nations and all Thessaly;  A wondrous happiness hath come to be:  Therefore pray, dance, give offerings and make full  Your altars with the life-blood of the Bull!  For me ... my heart is changed; my life shall mend  Henceforth. For surely Fortune is a friend.    [_He goes with_ ALCESTIS _into the house_.]    CHORUS.  There be many shapes of mystery;  And many things God brings to be,    Past hope or fear.  And the end men looked for cometh not,  And a path is there where no man thought.    So hath it fallen here.          NOTES      P. 3, Prologue. Asclepios (Latin Aesculapius), son of Apollo, the  hero-physician, by his miraculous skill healed the dead. This transgressed  the divine law, so Zeus slew him. (The particular dead man raised by him  was Hippolytus, who came to life in Italy under the name of Virbius, and  was worshipped with Artemis at Aricia.) Apollo in revenge, not presuming  to attack Zeus himself, killed the Cyclopes, and was punished by being  exiled from heaven and made servant to a mortal. There are several such  stories of gods made servants to human beings.    P. 3, l. 12, Beguiling.]--See Preface. In the original story he made them  drunk with wine. (Aesch. _Eumenides_, 728.) As the allusion would  doubtless be clear to the Greek audience, I have added a mention of wine  which is not in the Greek. Libations to the Elder Gods, such as the Fates  and Eumenides, had to be \"wineless.\" Historically this probably means that  the worship dates from a time before wine was used in Greece.    P. 4, l. 22, The stain of death must not come nigh My radiance.]--Compare  Artemis in the last scene of the _Hippolytus_. The presence of a dead  body would be a pollution to Apollo, though that of Thanatos (Death)  himself seems not to be so. It is rather Thanatos who is dazzled and  blinded by Apollo, like an owl or bat in the sunlight.    P. 5, l. 43, Rob me of my second prey.]--\"You first cheated me of Admetus,  and now you cheat me of his substitute.\"    P. 6, l. 59, The rich would buy, etc.]--Here and throughout this difficult  little dialogue I follow the readings of my own text in the _Bibliotheca  Oxoniensis_.    P. 7, l. 74, To lay upon her hair my sword.]--As the sacrificing priest  cut off a lock of hair from the victim's head before the actual sacrifice.    P. 8, l. 77, Chorus.]--The Chorus consists of citizens, probably Elders,  of the city of Pherae. Dr. Verrall has rightly pointed out that there is  some general dissatisfaction in the town at Admetus's behaviour (l. 210  ff.). These citizens come to mourn with Admetus out of old friendship,  though they do not altogether defend him.    The Chorus is very drastically broken up into so many separate persons  conversing with one another; the treatment in the _Rhesus_ is similar  but even bolder. See _Rhesus_, pp. 28-31, 37-42. Cf. also the  entrance-choruses of the _Trojan Women_ (pp. 19-23) and the  _Medea_ (pp. 10-13); and ll. 872 ff., 889 ff., pp. 50, 51, below.    Instead of assigning the various lines definitely to First, Second, Third  Citizen, and so on, I have put a \"paragraphus\" (--), the ancient Greek  sign for indicating a new speaker.    P. 8, l. 82, Pelias' daughter.]--_i.e._ Alcestis.    P. 8, l. 92, Paian.]--The Healer. The word survives chiefly as a cry for  help and as an epithet or title of Apollo or Asclepios. \"Paian,\" Latin  Paean, is also a cry of victory; but the relation of the two meanings is  not quite made out. (Pronounce rather like \"Pah-yan.\") Cf. l. 220.    P. 9, l. 112, To wander o'er leagues of land.]--You could sometimes save a  sick person by appealing to an oracle, such as that of Apollo in Lycia or  of Zeus Ammon in the Libyan desert; but now no sacrifice will help. Only  Asclepios, were he still on earth, might have helped us. (See on the  Prologue.)    P. 12, l. 150, 'Fore God she dies high-hearted.]--What impresses the Elder  is the calm and deliberate way in which Alcestis faces these preparations.    P. 12, l. 162, Before the Hearth-Fire.]--Hestia, the hearth-fire, was a  goddess, the Latin Vesta, and is addressed as \"Mother.\" It is  characteristic in Alcestis to think chiefly about happy marriages for the  children.    P. 12, l. 182, Happier perhaps, more true she cannot be.]--A famous line  and open to parody. Cf. Aristophanes, _Knights_, 1251 (\"Another wear  this crown instead of me, Happier perhaps; worse thief he cannot be\"). And  see on l. 367 below.    P. 15, l. 228, Hearts have bled.]--People have committed suicide for less  than this.    P. 16, l. 244, O Sun.]--Alcestis has come out to see the Sun and Sky for  the last time and say good-bye to them. It is a rite or practice often  mentioned in Greek poetry. Her beautiful wandering lines about Charon and  his boat are the more natural because she is not dying from any disease  but is being mysteriously drawn away by the Powers of Death.    P. 16, l. 252, A boat, two-oared.]--She sees Charon, the boatman who  ferried the souls of the dead across the river Styx.    P. 17, l. 259, Drawing, drawing.]--The creature whom she sees drawing her  to \"the palaces of the dead\" is certainly not Charon, who had no wings,  but was like an old boatman in a peasant's cap and sleeveless tunic; nor  can he be Hades, the throned King to whose presence she must eventually  go. Apparently, therefore, he must be Thanatos, whom we have just seen on  the stage. He was evidently supposed to be invisible to ordinary human  eyes.    P. 18, l. 280, Alcestis's speech.]--Great simplicity and sincerity are the  keynotes of this fine speech. Alcestis does not make light of her  sacrifice: she enjoyed her life and values it; she wishes one of the old  people had died instead; she is very earnest that Admetus shall not marry  again, chiefly for the children's sake, but possibly also from some little  shadow of jealousy. A modern dramatist would express all this, if at all,  by a scene or a series of scenes of conversation; Euripides always uses  the long self-revealing speech. Observe how little romantic love there is  in Alcestis, though Admetus is full of it. See Preface, pp. xiii, xiv.    Pp. 19, 20, l. 328 ff., Admetus's speech.]--If the last speech made us  know Alcestis, this makes us know Admetus fully as well. At one time the  beauty and passion of it almost make us forget its ultimate hollowness; at  another this hollowness almost makes us lose patience with its beautiful  language. In this state of balance the touch of satire in l. 338 f. (\"My  mother I will know no more,\" etc.), and the fact that he speaks  immediately after the complete sincerity of Alcestis, conspire to weigh  down the scale against Admetus. There can be no doubt that he means, and  means passionately, all that he says. Only he could not quite manage to  die when it was not strictly necessary.    P. 20, l. 355, If Orpheus' voice were mine.]--The bard and prophet,  Orpheus, went down to the dead to win back his wife, Eurydice. Hades and  Persephone, spell-bound by his music, granted his prayer that Eurydice  should return to the light, on condition that he should go before her,  harping, and should never look back to see if she was following. Just at  the end of the journey he looked back,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10542"],[0,"The Boats of the \"Glen Carrig\" (#9)"],[1,"scarce above the water, and through these later we let the boat  sail; for they had not sufficient density to impede our progress more  than a little.    And then, when the day was far spent, we came in sight of another  wreck amid the weeds. She lay in from the edge perhaps so much as the  half of a mile, and she had all three of her lower masts in, and her  lower yards squared. But what took our eyes more than aught else was a  great superstructure which had been built upward from her rails,  almost half-way to her main tops, and this, as we were able to  perceive, was supported by ropes let down from the yards; but of what  material the superstructure was composed, I have no knowledge; for it  was so over-grown with some form of green stuff--as was so much of the  hull as showed above the weed--as to defy our guesses. And because of  this growth, it was borne upon us that the ship must have been lost to  the world a very great age ago. At this suggestion, I grew full of  solemn thought; for it seemed to me that we had come upon the cemetery  of the oceans.    Now, in a little while after we had passed this ancient craft, the night  came down upon us, and we prepared for sleep, and because the boat was  making some little way through the water, the bo'sun gave out that each  of us should stand our turn at the steering-oar, and that he was to be  called should any fresh matter transpire. And so we settled down for the  night, and owing to my previous sleeplessness, I was full weary, so that  I knew nothing until the one whom I was to relieve shook me into  wakefulness. So soon as I was fully waked, I perceived that a low moon  hung above the horizon, and shed a very ghostly light across the great  weed world to starboard. For the rest, the night was exceeding quiet, so  that no sound came to me in all that ocean, save the rippling of the  water upon our bends as the boat forged slowly along. And so I settled  down to pass the time ere I should be allowed to sleep; but first I asked  the man whom I had relieved, how long a time had passed since moon-rise;  to which he replied that it was no more than the half of an hour, and  after that I questioned whether he had seen aught strange amid the weed  during his time at the oar; but he had seen nothing, except that once he  had fancied a light had shown in the midst of the waste; yet it could  have been naught save a humor of the imagination; though apart from this,  he had heard a strange crying a little after midnight, and twice there  had been great splashes among the weed. And after that he fell asleep,  being impatient at my questioning.    Now it so chanced that my watch had come just before the dawn; for which  I was full of thankfulness, being in that frame of mind when the dark  breeds strange and unwholesome fancies. Yet, though I was so near to the  dawn, I was not to escape free of the eerie influence of that place; for,  as I sat, running my gaze to and fro over its grey immensity, it came to  me that there were strange movements among the weed, and I seemed to see  vaguely, as one may see things in dreams, dim white faces peer out at me  here and there; yet my common sense assured me that I was but deceived by  the uncertain light and the sleep in my eyes; yet for all that, it put my  nerves on the quiver.    A little later, there came to my ears the noise of a very great splash  amid the weed; but though I stared with intentness, I could nowhere  discern aught as likely to be the cause thereof. And then, suddenly,  between me and the moon, there drove up from out of that great waste a  vast bulk, flinging huge masses of weed in all directions. It seemed to  be no more than a hundred fathoms distant, and, against the moon, I saw  the outline of it most clearly--a mighty devilfish. Then it had fallen  back once more with a prodigious splash, and so the quiet fell again,  finding me sore afraid, and no little bewildered that so monstrous a  creature could leap with such agility. And then (in my fright I had let  the boat come near to the edge of the weed) there came a subtle stir  opposite to our starboard bow, and something slid down into the water. I  swayed upon the oar to turn the boat's head outward, and with the same  movement leant forward and sideways to peer, bringing my face near to the  boat's rail. In the same instant, I found myself looking down into a  white demoniac face, human save that the mouth and nose had greatly the  appearance of a beak. The thing was gripping at the side of the boat with  two flickering hands--gripping the bare, smooth outer surface, in a way  that woke in my mind a sudden memory of the great devilfish which had  clung to the side of the wreck we had passed in the previous dawn. I saw  the face come up towards me, and one misshapen hand fluttered almost to  my throat, and there came a sudden, hateful reek in my nostrils--foul and  abominable. Then, I came into possession of my faculties, and drew back  with great haste and a wild cry of fear. And then I had the steering-oar  by the middle, and was smiting downward with the loom over the side of  the boat; but the thing was gone from my sight. I remember shouting out  to the bo'sun and to the men to awake, and then the bo'sun had me by the  shoulder, was calling in my ear to know what dire thing had come about.  At that, I cried out that I did not know, and, presently, being somewhat  calmer, I told them of the thing that I had seen; but even as I told of  it, there seemed to be no truth in it, so that they were all at a loss to  know whether I had fallen asleep, or that I had indeed seen a devil.    And presently the dawn was upon us.          VII    The Island in the Weed      It was as we were all discussing the matter of the devil face that had  peered up at me out of the water, that Job, the ordinary seaman,  discovered the island in the light of the growing dawn, and, seeing it,  sprang to his feet, with so loud a cry that we were like for the moment  to have thought he had seen a second demon. Yet when we made discovery of  that which he had already perceived, we checked our blame at his sudden  shout; for the sight of land, after so much desolation, made us very warm  in our hearts.    Now at first the island seemed but a very small matter; for we did not  know at that time that we viewed it from its end; yet despite this, we  took to our oars and rowed with all haste towards it, and so, coming  nearer, were able to see that it had a greater size than we had imagined.  Presently, having cleared the end of it, and keeping to that side which  was further from the great mass of the weed-continent, we opened out a  bay that curved inward to a sandy beach, most seductive to our tired  eyes. Here, for the space of a minute, we paused to survey the prospect,  and I saw that the island was of a very strange shape, having a great  hump of black rock at either end, and dipping down into a steep valley  between them. In this valley there seemed to be a deal of a strange  vegetation that had the appearance of mighty toadstools; and down nearer  the beach there was a thick grove of a kind of very tall reed, and these  we discovered afterwards to be exceeding tough and light, having  something of the qualities of the bamboo.    Regarding the beach, it might have been most reasonably supposed that it  would be very thick with the driftweed; but this was not so, at least,  not at that time; though a projecting horn of the black rock which ran  out into the sea from the upper end of the island, was thick with it.    And now, the bo'sun having assured himself that there was no appearance  of any danger, we bent to our oars, and presently had the boat aground  upon the beach, and here, finding it convenient, we made our breakfast.  During this meal, the bo'sun discussed with us the most proper thing to  do, and it was decided to push the boat off from the shore, leaving Job  in her, whilst the remainder of us made some exploration of the island.    And so, having made an end of eating, we proceeded as we had  determined, leaving Job in the boat, ready to scull ashore for us if we  were pursued by any savage creature, while the rest of us made our way  towards the nearer hump, from which, as it stood some hundred feet  above the sea, we hoped to get a very good idea of the remainder of the  island. First, however, the bo'sun handed out to us the two cutlasses  and the cut-and-thrust (the other two cutlasses being in Josh's boat),  and, taking one himself, he passed me the cut-and-thrust, and gave the  other cutlass to the biggest of the men. Then he bade the others keep  their sheath knives handy, and was proceeding to lead the way, when one  of them called out to us to wait a moment, and, with that, ran quickly  to the clump of reeds. Here, he took one with both his hands and bent  upon it; but it would not break, so that he had to notch it about with  his knife, and thus, in a little, he had it clear. After this, he cut  off the upper part, which was too thin and lissome for his purpose, and  then thrust the handle of his knife into the end of the portion which  he had retained, and in this wise he had a most serviceable lance or  spear. For the reeds were very strong, and hollow after the fashion of  bamboo, and when he had bound some yarn about the end into which he had  thrust his knife, so as to prevent it splitting, it was a fit enough  weapon for any man.    Now the bo'sun, perceiving the happiness of the fellow's idea, bade the  rest make to themselves similar weapons, and whilst they were busy thus,  he commended the man very warmly. And so, in a little, being now most  comfortably armed, we made inland towards the nearer black hill, in very  good spirits. Presently, we were come to the rock which formed the hill,  and found that it came up out of the sand with great abruptness, so that  we could not climb it on the seaward side. At that, the bo'sun led us"]]]
