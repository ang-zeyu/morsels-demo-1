One blow was enough to lay him low; the ease with which  Odysseus had disposed of his foe made him for a time popular with the  suitors.    Under an inspiration of Athena, Penelope came down once more to chide  the wooers for their insolence; she also upbraided them for their  stinginess.        \"Yours is not the custom of wooers in former days who were wont to      sue for wedlock with the daughter of a rich man and contend among      themselves. Such men offer oxen and stout cattle and glorious gifts;      they will never consume another's substance without payment.\"    Stung by the taunt, they gave her the accustomed presents, while  Odysseus rejoiced that she flattered their heart in soft words with a  different intent in her spirit. The insolence of the suitors was matched  by the pertness of the serving maids, of whom Melantho was the most  impudent. A threat from Odysseus drew down upon him the wrath of the  suitors who were with difficulty persuaded by Telemachus to depart home  to their beds.    That night Odysseus and his son removed the arms from the walls, the  latter being told to urge as a pretext for his action the necessity of  cleaning from them the rust and of removing a temptation to violence  when the suitors were heated with wine. At the promised interview with  his wife Odysseus again pretended he was a Cretan; describing the very  dress which Odysseus had worn, he assured her that he would soon return  with the many treasures which he had collected. Half persuaded by the  exact description of a garment she had herself made, she bade her maids  look to him, but he would not suffer any of them to approach him save  his old nurse Eurycleia. As she was washing him in the dim light of the  fireside her fingers touched the old scar above his knee, the result of  an accident in a boar-hunt during his youth.        \"Dropping the basin she fell backwards; joy and grief took her      heart at once, her eyes filled with tears and her utterance was      checked. Catching him by his beard, she said: 'In very sooth thou      art Odysseus, my dear boy; and I knew thee not before I had touched      the body of my lord.' So speaking she looked at Penelope, fain to      tell her that her lord was within. But Odysseus laid his hand upon      the nurse's mouth, with the other he drew her to him and whispered:      'Nurse, wouldst thou ruin me? Thou didst nourish me at thy breast,      and now I am come back after mighty sufferings. Be silent, lest      another learn the news, or I tell thee that when I have punished      the suitors I will not even refrain from thee when I destroy the      other women in my halls.'\"    Concealing the scar carefully under his rags by the fireside he put a  good interpretation on a strange dream which had visited his wife.    That night Odysseus with his own eyes witnessed the intrigues between  his women and the suitors. He heard his wife weeping in her chamber for  him and prayed to Zeus for aid in the coming trial. On the morrow he  was again outraged; the suitors were moved to laughter by a prophecy of  Theoclymenus:        \"Yet they were laughing with alien lips, the meat they ate was      dabbled with blood, their eyes were filled with tears and their      hearts boded lamentation. Among them spake Theoclymenus; 'Wretched      men, what is this evil that is come upon you? Your heads and faces      and the knees beneath you are shrouded in night, mourning is kindled      among you, your cheeks are bedewed with tears, the walls and the      fair pillars are sprinkled with blood, the forecourt and the yard is      full of spectres hastening to the gloom of Erebus; the sun hath      perished from the heaven and a mist of ruin hath swept upon you.'\"    In answer Eurymachus bade him begone if all within was night; taking him  at his word, the seer withdrew before the coming ruin.    Then Athena put it into the heart of Penelope to set the suitors a final  test. She brought forth the bow of Odysseus together with twelve axes.  It had been an exercise of her lord to set up the axes in a line, string  the bow and shoot through the heads of the axes which had been hollowed  for that purpose. She promised to follow at once the suitor who could  string the bow and shoot through the axes. First Telemachus set up the  axes and tried to string the weapon; failing three times he would have  succeeded at the next effort but for a glance from his father. Leiodes  vainly tried his strength, to be rebuked by Antinous who suggested that  the bow should be made more pliant by being heated at the fire.    Noticing that Eumaeus and Philoetius had gone out together Odysseus went  after them and revealed himself to them; the three then returned to the  hall. After all the suitors had failed except Antinous, who did not deem  that he should waste a feast-day in stringing bows, Odysseus begged that  he might try, Penelope insisting on his right to attempt the feat. When  she retired Eumaeus brought the bow to Odysseus, then told Eurycleia to  keep the woman in their chambers while Philoetius bolted the hall door.        \"But already Odysseus was turning the bow this way and that testing      it lest the worms had devoured it in his absence. Then when he had      balanced it and looked it all over, even as when a man skilled in      the lyre and song easily putteth a new string about a peg, even so      without an effort Odysseus strung his mighty bow. Taking it in his      right hand he tried the string which sang sweetly beneath his touch      like to the voice of a swallow. Then he took an arrow and shot it      with a straight aim through the axes, missing not one. Then he spake      to Telemachus: 'Thy guest bringeth thee no shame as he sitteth in      thy halls, for I missed not the mark nor spent much time in the      stringing. My strength is yet whole within me. But now it is time to      make a banquet for the Achaeans in the light of day and then season      it with song and dance, which are the crown of revelry.' So speaking      he nodded, and his son took a sword and a spear and stood by him      clad in gleaming bronze.\"    The first victim was Antinous, whom Odysseus shot through the neck as he  was in the act of drinking, never dreaming that one man would attack  a multitude of suitors. Eurymachus fell after vainly attempting a  compromise. Melanthius was caught in the act of supplying arms to the  rest and was left bound to be dealt with when the main work was  done. Athena herself encouraged Odysseus in his labour of vengeance,  deflecting from him any weapons that were hurled at him. At length all  was over, the serving women were made to cleanse the hall of all traces  of bloodshed; the guiltiest of them were hanged, while Melanthius died  a horrible death by mutilation. Odysseus then summoned his wife to his  presence.    Eurycleia carried the message to her, laughing with joy so much that  Penelope deemed her mad. The story of the vengeance which Odysseus had  exacted was so incredible that it must have been the act of a god, not  a man. When she entered the hall Telemachus upbraided her for her  unbelief, but Odysseus smiled on hearing that she intended to test him  by certain proofs which they two alone were aware of. He withdrew for  a time to cleanse him of his stains and to put on his royal garments,  after ordering the servants to maintain a revelry to blind the people to  the death of their chief men.    When he reappeared, endued with grace which Athena gave him, he  marvelled at the untoward heart which the gods had given his wife and  bade his nurse lay him his bed. Penelope caught up his words quickly;  the bed was to be laid outside the chamber which he himself had made.  The words filled Odysseus with dismay:        \"Who hath put my bed elsewhere? It would be a hard task for any man      however cunning, except a god set it in some other place. Of men      none could easily shift it, for there is a wonder in that cunningly      made bed whereat I laboured and none else. Within the courtyard was      growing the trunk of an olive; round it I built my bed-chamber with      thick stones and roofed it well, placing in it doors that shut tight.      Then I cut away the olive branches, smoothed the trunk, made a      bedpost, and bored all with a gimlet. From that foundation I smoothed      my bed, tricking it out with gold and silver and ivory and stretching      from its frame thongs of cow-hide dyed red. Such is the wonder I tell      of, yet I know not, Lady, whether the bed is yet fixed there, or      whether another hath moved it, cutting the foundation of olive from      underneath.\"    On hearing the details of their secret Penelope ran to him casting  her arms about him and begging him to forgive her unbelief, for many  a pretender had come, making her ever more and more suspicious. Thus  reunited the two spent the night in recounting the agonies of their  separation; Odysseus mentioned the strange prophecy of Teiresias,  deciding to seek out his father on the morrow.    A vivid description tells how the souls of the suitors were conducted  to the realm of the dead, the old comrades of Odysseus before Troy  recognising in the vengeance all the marks of his handiwork. Odysseus  found his father in a wretched old age hoeing his garden, clad in  soiled garments with a goat-skin hat on his head which but increased his  sorrow. At the sight Odysseus was moved to tears of compassion. Yet even  then he could not refrain from his wiles, for he told how he had indeed  seen Odysseus though five years before. In despair the old man took the  dust in his hands and cast it about his head in mighty grief.        \"Then Odysseus' spirit was moved and the stinging throb smote his      nostrils.

Or sometimes they settled on the white and wax-like  blooms of the plant that creeps and clambers about the trees of the  forest; and their purple wings flashed out on the great blossoms as, when  the caravans go from Nurl to Thace, the gleaming silks flash out upon the  snow, where the crafty merchants spread them one by one to astonish the  mountaineers of the Hills of Noor.    But upon men and beasts the sun sent drowsiness. The river monsters along  the river's marge lay dormant in the slime. The sailors pitched a  pavilion, with golden tassels, for the captain upon the deck, and then  went, all but the helmsman, under a sail that they had hung as an awning  between two masts. Then they told tales to one another, each of his own  city or of the miracles of his god, until all were fallen asleep. The  captain offered me the shade of his pavillion with the gold tassels, and  there we talked for a while, he telling me that he was taking merchandise  to Perdondaris, and that he would take back to fair Belzoond things  appertaining to the affairs of the sea. Then, as I watched through the  pavilion's opening the brilliant birds and butterflies that crossed and  recrossed over the river, I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was a monarch  entering his capital underneath arches of flags, and all the musicians of  the world were there, playing melodiously their instruments; but no one  cheered.    In the afternoon, as the day grew cooler again, I awoke and found the  captain buckling on his scimitar, which he had taken off him while he  rested.    And now we were approaching the wide court of Astahahn, which opens upon  the river. Strange boats of antique design were chained there to the  steps. As we neared it we saw the open marble court, on three sides of  which stood the city fronting on colonnades. And in the court and along  the colonnades the people of that city walked with solemnity and care  according to the rites of ancient ceremony. All in that city was of  ancient device; the carving on the houses, which, when age had broken it,  remained unrepaired, was of the remotest times, and everywhere were  represented in stone beasts that have long since passed away from  Earth--the dragon, the griffin, the hippogriffin, and the different  species of gargoyle. Nothing was to be found, whether material or custom,  that was new in Astahahn. Now they took no notice at all of us as we went  by, but continued their processions and ceremonies in the ancient city,  and the sailors, knowing their custom, took no notice of them. But I  called, as we came near, to one who stood beside the water's edge, asking  him what men did in Astahahn and what their merchandise was, and with whom  they traded. He said, \"Here we have fettered and manacled Time, who would  otherwise slay the gods.\"    I asked him what gods they worshipped in that city, and he said, \"All  those gods whom Time has not yet slain.\" Then he turned from me and would  say no more, but busied himself in behaving in accordance with ancient  custom. And so, according to the will of Yann, we drifted onwards and left  Astahahn. The river widened below Astahahn, and we found in greater  quantities such birds as prey on fishes. And they were very wonderful in  their plumage, and they came not out of the jungle, but flew, with their  long necks stretched out before them, and their legs lying on the wind  behind, straight up the river over the mid-stream.    And now the evening began to gather in. A thick white mist had appeared  over the river, and was softly rising higher. It clutched at the trees  with long impalpable arms, it rose higher and higher, chilling the air;  and white shapes moved away into the jungle as though the ghosts of  shipwrecked mariners were searching stealthily in the darkness for the  spirits of evil that long ago had wrecked them on the Yann.    As the sun sank behind the field of orchids that grew on the matted summit  of the jungle, the river monsters came wallowing out of the slime in which  they had reclined during the heat of the day, and the great beasts of the  jungle came down to drink. The butterflies a while since were gone to  rest. In little narrow tributaries that we passed night seemed already to  have fallen, though the sun which had disappeared from us had not yet set.    And now the birds of the jungle came flying home far over us, with the  sunlight glistening pink upon their breasts, and lowered their pinions as  soon as they saw the Yann, and dropped into the trees. And the widgeon  began to go up the river in great companies, all whistling, and then would  suddenly wheel and all go down again. And there shot by us the small and  arrow-like teal; and we heard the manifold cries of flocks of geese, which  the sailors told me had recently come in from crossing over the Lispasian  ranges; every year they come by the same way, close by the peak of Mluna,  leaving it to the left, and the mountain eagles know the way they come  and--men say--the very hour, and every year they expect them by the same  way as soon as the snows have fallen upon the Northern Plains. But soon it  grew so dark that we heard those birds no more, and only heard the  whirring of their wings, and of countless others besides, until they all  settled down along the banks of the river, and it was the hour when the  birds of the night went forth. Then the sailors lit the lanterns for the  night, and huge moths appeared, flapping about the ship, and at moments  their gorgeous colours would be revealed by the lanterns, then they would  pass into the night again, where all was black. And again the sailors  prayed, and thereafter we supped and slept, and the helmsman took our  lives into his care.    When I awoke I found that we had indeed come to Perdondaris, that famous  city. For there it stood upon the left of us, a city fair and notable, and  all the more pleasant for our eyes to see after the jungle that was so  long with us. And we were anchored by the market-place, and the captain's  merchandise was all displayed, and a merchant of Perdondaris stood looking  at it. And the captain had his scimitar in his hand, and was beating with  it in anger upon the deck, and the splinters were flying up from the white  planks; for the merchant had offered him a price for his merchandise that  the captain declared to be an insult to himself and his country's gods,  whom he now said to be great and terrible gods, whose curses were to be  dreaded. But the merchant waved his hands, which were of great fatness,  showing the pink palms, and swore that of himself he thought not at all,  but only of the poor folk in the huts beyond the city to whom he wished to  sell the merchandise for as low a price as possible, leaving no  remuneration for himself. For the merchandise was mostly the thick  toomarund carpets that in the winter keep the wind from the floor, and  tollub which the people smoke in pipes. Therefore the merchant said if he  offered a piffek more the poor folk must go without their toomarunds when  the winter came, and without their tollub in the evenings, or else he and  his aged father must starve together. Thereat the captain lifted his  scimitar to his own throat, saying that he was now a ruined man, and that  nothing remained to him but death. And while he was carefully lifting his  beard with his left hand, the merchant eyed the merchandise again, and  said that rather than see so worthy a captain die, a man for whom he had  conceived an especial love when first he saw the manner in which he  handled his ship, he and his aged father should starve together and  therefore he offered fifteen piffeks more.    When he said this the captain prostrated himself and prayed to his gods  that they might yet sweeten this merchant's bitter heart--to his little  lesser gods, to the gods that bless Belzoond.    At last the merchant offered yet five piffeks more. Then the captain wept,  for he said that he was deserted of his gods; and the merchant also wept,  for he said that he was thinking of his aged father, and of how he soon  would starve, and he hid his weeping face with both his hands, and eyed  the tollub again between his fingers. And so the bargain was concluded,  and the merchant took the toomarund and tollub, paying for them out of a  great clinking purse. And these were packed up into bales again, and three  of the merchant's slaves carried them upon their heads into the city. And  all the while the sailors had sat silent, cross-legged in a crescent upon  the deck, eagerly watching the bargain, and now a murmur of satisfaction  arose among them, and they began to compare it among themselves with other  bargains that they had known. And I found out from them that there are  seven merchants in Perdondaris, and that they had all come to the captain  one by one before the bargaining began, and each had warned him privately  against the others. And to all the merchants the captain had offered the  wine of his own country, that they make in fair Belzoond, but could in no  wise persuade them to it. But now that the bargain was over, and the  sailors were seated at the first meal of the day, the captain appeared  among them with a cask of that wine, and we broached it with care and all  made merry together. And the captain was glad in his heart because he knew  that he had much honour in the eyes of his men because of the bargain that  he had made. So the sailors drank the wine of their native land, and soon  their thoughts were back in fair Belzoond and the little neighbouring  cities of Durl and Duz.    But for me the captain poured into a little jar some heavy yellow wine  from a small jar which he kept apart among his sacred things. Thick and  sweet it was, even like honey, yet there was in its heart a mighty,"]]]
