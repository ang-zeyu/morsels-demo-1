   18:026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the             inhabitants thereof.    18:026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.    18:026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth             the earth upon nothing.    18:026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is             not rent under them.    18:026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his             cloud upon it.    18:026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and             night come to an end.    18:026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his             reproof.    18:026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding             he smiteth through the proud.    18:026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath             formed the crooked serpent.    18:026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is             heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?    18:027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,    18:027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the             Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;    18:027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in             my nostrils;    18:027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter             deceit.    18:027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not             remove mine integrity from me.    18:027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart             shall not reproach me so long as I live.    18:027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against             me as the unrighteous.    18:027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,             when God taketh away his soul?    18:027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?    18:027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call             upon God?    18:027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the             Almighty will I not conceal.    18:027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus             altogether vain?    18:027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage             of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.    18:027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his             offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.    18:027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his             widows shall not weep.    18:027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as             the clay;    18:027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the             innocent shall divide the silver.    18:027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the             keeper maketh.    18:027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he             openeth his eyes, and he is not.    18:027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him             away in the night.    18:027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a             storm hurleth him out of his place.    18:027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee             out of his hand.    18:027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of             his place.    18:028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold             where they fine it.    18:028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the             stone.    18:028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all             perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.    18:028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters             forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away             from men.    18:028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is             turned up as it were fire.    18:028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust             of gold.    18:028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's             eye hath not seen:    18:028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion             passed by it.    18:028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the             mountains by the roots.    18:028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every             precious thing.    18:028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is             hid bringeth he forth to light.    18:028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of             understanding?    18:028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the             land of the living.    18:028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not             with me.    18:028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed             for the price thereof.    18:028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious             onyx, or the sapphire.    18:028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of             it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.    18:028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price             of wisdom is above rubies.    18:028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be             valued with pure gold.    18:028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of             understanding?    18:028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close             from the fowls of the air.    18:028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with             our ears.    18:028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place             thereof.    18:028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the             whole heaven;    18:028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters             by measure.    18:028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the             lightning of the thunder:    18:028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and             searched it out.    18:028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is             wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.    18:029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,    18:029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God             preserved me;    18:029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I             walked through darkness;    18:029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was             upon my tabernacle;    18:029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about             me;    18:029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out             rivers of oil;    18:029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared             my seat in the street!    18:029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,             and stood up.    18:029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their             mouth.    18:029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the             roof of their mouth.    18:029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye             saw me, it gave witness to me:    18:029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,             and him that had none to help him.    18:029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and             I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.    18:029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as             a robe and a diadem.    18:029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.    18:029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I             searched out.    18:029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out             of his teeth.    18:029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my             days as the sand.    18:029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all             night upon my branch.    18:029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.    18:029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my             counsel.    18:029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped             upon them.    18:029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their             mouth wide as for the latter rain.    18:029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of             my countenance they cast not down.    18:029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in             the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.    18:030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,             whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs             of my flock.    18:030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in             whom old age was perished?    18:030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the             wilderness in former time desolate and waste.    18:030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their             meat.    18:030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them             as after a thief;)    18:030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8019"],[0,"The Bible, King James version, Book 19: Psalms (#8)"],[1," wilt hear, O Lord my God.    19:038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over             me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.    19:038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before             me.    19:038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.    19:038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they             that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.    19:038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;             because I follow the thing that good is.    19:038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.    19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.    19:039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my             tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked             is before me.    19:039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and             my sorrow was stirred.    19:039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire             burned: then spake I with my tongue,    19:039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,             what it is: that I may know how frail I am.    19:039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age             is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state             is altogether vanity. Selah.    19:039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are             disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who             shall gather them.    19:039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.    19:039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the             reproach of the foolish.    19:039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.    19:039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of             thine hand.    19:039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou             makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every             man is vanity. Selah.    19:039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy             peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a             sojourner, as all my fathers were.    19:039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,             and be no more.    19:040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and             heard my cry.    19:040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry             clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.    19:040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our             God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.    19:040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and             respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.    19:040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast             done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be             reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak             of them, they are more than can be numbered.    19:040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast             thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not             required.    19:040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is             written of me,    19:040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my             heart.    19:040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I             have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.    19:040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have             declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not             concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great             congregation.    19:040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy             lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.    19:040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities             have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;             they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart             faileth me.    19:040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help             me.    19:040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my             soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to             shame that wish me evil.    19:040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto             me, Aha, aha.    19:040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let             such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be             magnified.    19:040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou             art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.    19:041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver             him in time of trouble.    19:041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall             be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto             the will of his enemies.    19:041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou             wilt make all his bed in his sickness.    19:041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have             sinned against thee.    19:041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name             perish?    19:041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart             gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth             it.    19:041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do             they devise my hurt.    19:041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now             that he lieth he shall rise up no more.    19:041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did             eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.    19:041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I             may requite them.    19:041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth             not triumph over me.    19:041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and             settest me before thy face for ever.    19:041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to             everlasting. Amen, and Amen.    19:042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul             after thee, O God.    19:042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I             come and appear before God?    19:042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they             continually say unto me, Where is thy God?    19:042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I             had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of             God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that             kept holyday.    19:042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted             in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the             help of his countenance.    19:042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I             remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,             from the hill Mizar.    19:042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all             thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.    19:042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,             and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto             the God of my life.    19:042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why             go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?    19:042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while             they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?    19:042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted             within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who             is the health of my countenance, and my God.    19:043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:             O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.    19:043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me             off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?    19:043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them             bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.    19:043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding             joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.    19:043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted             within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the             health of my countenance, and my God.    19:044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,             what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.    19:044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and             plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast             them out.    19:044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,             neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and             thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou             hadst a favour unto them.    19:044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.    19:044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name             will we tread them under that rise up against us.    19:044:006 For I"]]]
