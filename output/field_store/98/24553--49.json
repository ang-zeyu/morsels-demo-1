He learned his  letters that he might read books and see how men in the great world  outside of his woods had borne themselves in the fight for which he  longed. He learned to write, first, that he might have an  accomplishment his playmates had not; then that he might help his  elders by writing their letters, and enjoy the feeling of usefulness  which this gave him; and finally that he might copy what struck him in  his reading and thus make it his own for future use. He learned to  cipher certainly from no love of mathematics, but because it might  come in play in some more congenial business than the farm-work which  bounded the horizon of his contemporaries. Had it not been for that  interior spur which kept his clear spirit at its task, his schools  could have done little for him; for, counting his attendance under  Riney and Hazel in Kentucky, and under Dorsey, Crawford, and Swaney in  Indiana, it amounted to less than a year in all. The schools were much  alike. They were held in deserted cabins of round logs, with earthen  floors, and small holes for windows, sometimes illuminated by as much  light as could penetrate through panes of paper greased with lard. The  teachers were usually in keeping with their primitive surroundings.  The profession offered no rewards sufficient to attract men of  education or capacity. After a few months of desultory instruction  young Abraham knew all that these vagrant literati could teach him.  His last school-days were passed with one Swaney in 1826, who taught  at a distance of four and a half miles from the Lincoln cabin. The  nine miles of walking doubtless seemed to Thomas Lincoln a waste of  time, and the lad was put at steady work and saw no more of school.    But it is questionable whether he lost anything by being deprived of  the ministrations of the backwoods dominies. When his tasks ended, his  studies became the chief pleasure of his life. In all the intervals of  his work--in which he never took delight, knowing well enough that he  was born for something better than that--he read, wrote, and ciphered  incessantly. His reading was naturally limited by his opportunities,  for books were among the rarest of luxuries in that region and time.  But he read everything he could lay his hands upon, and he was  certainly fortunate in the few books of which he became the possessor.  It would hardly be possible to select a better handful of classics for  a youth in his circumstances than the few volumes he turned with a  nightly and daily hand--the Bible, \"Aesop's Fables,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\"  \"The Pilgrim's Progress,\" a history of the United States, and Weem's  \"Life of Washington.\" These were the best, and these he read over and  over till he knew them almost by heart. But his voracity for anything  printed was insatiable. He would sit in the twilight and read a  dictionary as long as he could see. He used to go to David Turnham's,  the town constable, and devour the \"Revised Statutes of Indiana,\" as  boys in our day do the \"Three Guardsmen.\" Of the books he did not own  he took voluminous notes, filling his copy-book with choice extracts,  and poring over them until they were fixed in his memory. He could not  afford to waste paper upon his original compositions. He would sit by  the fire at night and cover the wooden shovel with essays and  arithmetical exercises, which he would shave off and then begin again.  It is touching to think of this great-spirited child, battling year  after year against his evil star, wasting his ingenuity upon devices  and makeshifts, his high intelligence starving for want of the simple  appliances of education that are now offered gratis to the poorest and  most indifferent. He did a man's work from the time he left school;  his strength and stature were already far beyond those of ordinary  men. He wrought his appointed tasks ungrudgingly, though without  enthusiasm; but when his employer's day was over, his own began. John  Hanks says: \"When Abe and I returned to the house from work he would  go to the cupboard, snatch a piece of corn-bread, take down a book,  sit down, cock his legs up as high as his head, and read.\" The picture  may be lacking in grace, but its truthfulness is beyond question. The  habit remained with him always. Some of his greatest work in later  years was done in this grotesque Western fashion,--\"sitting on his  shoulder-blades.\"    [Sidenote: W. H. Lamou \"Life of Lincoln,\" p. 37.]    [Sidenote: Damon, p. 80.]    Otherwise his life at this time differed little from that of ordinary  farm-hands. His great strength and intelligence made him a valuable  laborer, and his unfailing good temper and flow of rude rustic wit  rendered him the most agreeable of comrades. He was always ready with  some kindly act or word for others. Once he saved the life of the town  drunkard, whom he found freezing by the roadside, by carrying him in  his strong arms to the tavern, and working over him until he revived.  It is a curious fact that this act of common humanity was regarded as  something remarkable in the neighborhood; the grateful sot himself  always said \"it was mighty clever of Abe to tote me so far that cold  night.\" It was also considered an eccentricity that he hated and  preached against cruelty to animals. Some of his comrades remember  still his bursts of righteous wrath, when a boy, against the wanton  murder of turtles and other creatures. He was evidently of better and  finer clay than his fellows, even in those wild and ignorant days. At  home he was the life of the singularly assorted household, which  consisted, besides his parents and himself, of his own sister, Mrs.  Lincoln's two girls and boy, Dennis Hanks, the legacy of the dying  Sparrow family, and John Hanks (son of the carpenter Joseph with whom  Thomas Lincoln learned his trade), who came from Kentucky several  years after the others. It was probably as much the inexhaustible good  nature and kindly helpfulness of young Abraham which kept the peace  among all these heterogeneous elements, effervescing with youth and  confined in a one-roomed cabin, as it was the Christian sweetness and  firmness of the woman of the house. It was a happy and united  household: brothers and sisters and cousins living peacefully under  the gentle rule of the good stepmother, but all acknowledging from a  very early period the supremacy in goodness and cleverness of their  big brother Abraham. Mrs. Lincoln, not long before her death, gave  striking testimony of his winning and loyal character. She said to Mr.  Herndon: \"I can say, what scarcely one mother in a thousand can say,  Abe never gave me a cross word or look, and never refused in fact or  appearance to do anything I asked him. His mind and mine--what little  I had--seemed to run together.... I had a son John, who was raised  with Abe. Both were good boys, but I must say, both now being dead,  that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or expect to see.\" Such were the  beginnings of this remarkable career, sacred as we see from childhood,  to duty and to human kindliness.    \"We are making no claim of early saintship for him. He was merely a  good boy, with sufficient wickedness to prove his humanity. One of his  employers, undazzled by recent history, faithfully remembers that  young Abe liked his dinner and his pay better than his work: there is  surely nothing alien to ordinary mortality in this. It is also  reported that he sometimes impeded the celerity of harvest operations  by making burlesque speeches, or worse than that, comic sermons, from  the top of some tempting stump, to the delight of the hired hands and  the exasperation of the farmer. His budding talents as a writer were  not always used discreetly. He was too much given to scribbling coarse  satires and chronicles, in prose, and in something which had to him  and his friends the air of verse. From this arose occasional heart-  burnings and feuds, in which Abraham bore his part according to the  custom of the country. Despite his Quaker ancestry and his natural  love of peace, he was no non-resistant, and when he once entered upon  a quarrel the opponent usually had the worst of it. But he was  generous and placable, and some of his best friends were those with  whom he had had differences, and had settled them in the way then  prevalent,--in a ring of serious spectators, calmly and judicially  ruminant, under the shade of some spreading oak, at the edge of the  timber. Before we close our sketch of this period of Lincoln's life,  it may not be amiss to glance for a moment at the state of society  among the people with whom his lot was cast in these important years.    In most respects there had been little moral or material improvement  since the early settlement of the country. Their houses were usually  of one room, built of round logs with the bark on. We have known a man  to gain the sobriquet of \"Split-log Mitchell\" by indulging in the  luxury of building a cabin of square-hewn timbers. Their dress was  still mostly of tanned deer-hide, a material to the last degree  uncomfortable when the wearer was caught in a shower. Their shoes were  of the same, and a good Western authority calls a wet moccasin \"a  decent way of going barefoot.\" About the time, however, when Lincoln  grew to manhood, garments of wool and of tow began to be worn, dyed  with the juice of the butternut or white walnut, and the hides of  neat-cattle began to be tanned. But for a good while it was only the  women who indulged in these novelties. There was little public  worship. Occasionally an itinerant preacher visited a county, and the  settlers for miles around would go nearly in mass to the meeting. If a  man was possessed of a wagon, the family rode luxuriously; but as a  rule the men walked and the women went on horseback with the little  children in their arms. It was considered no violation of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6818"],[0,"The Arctic Prairies : a Canoe-Journey of 2,000 Miles in Search of the Caribou; (#8)"],[1,"alf-blind, was willing to go on condition that they should  not walk too fast. Then they started for Osnaburgh House on Lake  St. Joseph, 150 miles away. The old man led off well, evidently knew  the way, but sometimes would stop, cover his eyes with his hands,  look at the ground and then at the sky, and turn on a sharp angle.  He proved a fine guide and brought the expedition there in good  time.    Next winter at Wayabimika (where Charley de la Ronde [Count de la  Ronde.] was in charge, but was leaving on a trip of 10 days) Omeegi  came in and asked for a present--\"a new shirt and a pair of pants.\"  This is the usual outfit for a corpse. He explained that he was to  die before Charley came back; that he would die \"when the sun rose  at that island\" (a week ahead). He got the clothes, though every  one laughed at him. A week later he put on the new garments and  said: \"To-day I die when the sun is over that island!\" He went  out, looking at the sun from time to time, placidly smoking. When  the sun got to the right place he came in, lay down by the fire,  and in a few minutes was dead.    We buried him in the ground, to his brother's great indignation  when he heard of it. He said: \"You white men live on things that  come out of the ground, and are buried in the ground, and properly,  but we Indians live on things that run above ground, and want to  take our last sleep in the trees.\"    Another case of Indian clairvoyance ran thus: About 1879, when  Anderson was at Abitibi, the winter packet used to leave Montreal,  January 2, each year, and arrive at Abitibi January 19. This year  it did not come.  The men were much bothered as all plans were upset.  After waiting about two weeks, some of the Indians and half-breeds  advised Anderson to consult the conjuring woman, Mash-kou-tay  Ish-quay (Prairie woman) a Flathead from Stuart Lake, B. C. He  went and paid her some tobacco. She drummed and conjured all night.  She came in the morning and told him: \"The packet is at the foot  of a rapid now, where there is open water; the snow is deep and  the travelling heavy, but it will be here to-morrow when the sun  is at that point.\"    Sure enough, it all fell out as she had told. This woman married  a Hudson's Bay man named MacDonald, and he brought her to Lachine,  where she bore him 3 sons; then he died of small-pox, and Sir  George Simpson gave orders that she should be sent up to Abitibi  and there pensioned for as long as she lived. She was about 75 at  the time of the incident. She many times gave evidence of clairvoyant  power. The priest said he \"knew about it, and that she was helped  by the devil.\"    A gruesome picture of Indian life is given in the following incident.    One winter, 40 or 50 years ago, a band of Algonquin Indians at  Wayabimika all starved to death except one squaw and her baby; she  fled from the camp, carrying the child, thinking to find friends  and help at Nipigon House. She got as far as a small lake near  Deer Lake, and there discovered a cache, probably in a tree. This  contained one small bone fish-hook. She rigged up a line, but had  no bait. The wailing of the baby spurred her to action. No bait,  but she had a knife; a strip of flesh was quickly cut from her  own leg, a hole made through the ice, and a fine jack-fish was the  food that was sent to this devoted mother. She divided it with the  child, saving only enough for bait. She stayed there living on fish  until spring, then safely rejoined her people.    The boy grew up to be a strong man, but was cruel to his mother,  leaving her finally to die of starvation. Anderson knew the woman;  she showed him the sear where she cut the bait.    A piece of yet, more ancient history was supplied him in Northern  Ontario, and related to me thus:    Anderson was going to Kakabonga in June, 1879, and camped one  night on the east side of Birch Lake on the Ottawa, about 50 miles  north-east of Grand Lake Post.    He and his outfit of two canoes met Pah-pah-tay, chief of the Grand  Lake Indians, travelling with his family. He called Anderson's  attention to the shape of the point which had one good landing-place,  a little sandy bay, and told him the story he heard from his people  of a battle that was fought there with the Iroquois long, long ago.    Four or five Iroquois war-canoes, filled with warriors, came to  this place on a foray for scalps. Their canoes were drawn up on  the beach at night. They lighted fires and had a war-dance. Three  Grand Lake Algonquins, forefathers of Pah-pah-tay, saw the dance  from, hiding. They cached their canoe, one of them took a sharp  flint--\"we had no knives or axes then\"--swam across to the canoes,  and cut a great hole in the bottom of each.    The three then posted themselves at three different points in the  bushes, and began whooping in as many different ways as possible.  The Iroquois, thinking it a great war-party, rushed to their canoes  and pushed off quickly. When they were in deep water the canoes  sank and, as the warriors swam back ashore, the Algonquins killed  them one by one, saving alive only one, whom they maltreated, and  then let go with a supply of food, as a messenger to his people, and  to carry the warning that this would be the fate of every Iroquois  that entered the Algonquin country.          CHAPTER IX    MOSQUITOES        Reference to my Smith Landing Journal for June 17 shows the following:    \"The Spring is now on in full flood, the grass is high, the trees  are fully leaved, flowers are blooming, birds are nesting, and the  mosquitoes are a terror to man and beast.\"    If I were to repeat all the entries in that last key, it would make  dreary and painful reading; I shall rather say the worst right now,  and henceforth avoid the subject.    Every traveller in the country agrees that the mosquitoes are  a frightful curse. Captain Back, in 1833 (Journal, p. 117), said  that the sand-flies and mosquitoes are the worst of the hardships  to which the northern traveller is exposed.    T. Hutchins, over a hundred years ago, said that no one enters the  Barren Grounds in the summer, because no man can stand the stinging  insects. I had read these various statements, but did not grasp the  idea until I was among them. At Smith Landing, June 7, mosquitoes  began to be troublesome, quite as numerous as in the worst part of  the New Jersey marshes. An estimate of those on the mosquito bar  over my bed, showed 900 to 1,000 trying to get at me; day and night,  without change, the air was ringing with their hum.    This was early in the season. On July 9, on Nyarling River, they  were much worse, and my entry was as follows:    \"'On the back of Billy's coat, as he sat paddling before me, I  counted a round 400 mosquitoes boring away; about as many were on  the garments of his head and neck, a much less number on his arms  and legs. The air about was thick with them; at least as many  more, fully 1,000, singing and stinging and filling the air with  a droning hum. The rest of us were equally pestered.    \"'The Major, fresh, ruddy, full-blooded, far over 200 pounds in  plumpness, is the best feeding ground for mosquitoes I (or they,  probably) ever saw; he must be a great improvement on the smoke-dried  Indians. No matter where they land on him they strike it rich,  and at all times a dozen or more bloated bloodsuckers may be seen  hanging like red currants on his face and neck. He maintains that  they do not bother him, and scoffs at me for wearing a net. They  certainly do not impair his health, good looks, or his perennial good  humour, and I, for one, am thankful that his superior food-quality  gives us a corresponding measure of immunity.\"    At Salt River one could kill 100 with a stroke of the palm and  at times they obscured the colour of the horses. A little later  they were much worse. On 6 square inches of my tent I counted 30  mosquitoes, and the whole surface was similarly supplied; that is,  there were 24,000 on the tent and apparently as many more flying  about the door. Most of those that bite us are killed but that  makes not the slightest perceptible difference in their manners  or numbers. They reminded me of the Klondike gold-seekers. Thousands  go; great numbers must die a miserable death; not more than one in  10,000 can get away with a load of the coveted stuff, and yet each  believes that he is to be that one, and pushes on.    Dr. L. 0. Howard tells us that the mosquito rarely goes far from  its birthplace. That must refer to the miserable degenerates they  have in New Jersey, for these of the north offer endless evidence  of power to travel, as well as to resist cold and wind.    On July 21, 1907, we camped on a small island on Great Slave Lake.  It was about one-quarter mile long, several miles from mainland,  at least half a mile from any other island, apparently all rock,  and yet it was swarming with mosquitoes. Here, as elsewhere, they  were mad for our blood; those we knocked off and maimed, would  crawl up with sprained wings and twisted legs to sting as fiercely  as ever, as long as the beak would work.    We thought the stinging pests of the Buffalo country as bad as  possible, but they proved mild and scarce compared with those we  yet had to meet on the Arctic Barrens of our ultimate goal.    Each day they got worse; soon it became clear that mere adjectives  could not convey any idea of their terrors. Therefore I devised a  mosquito gauge. I held up a bare hand for 5 seconds by the watch,  then counted the number of borers on the back; there were 5 to 10.  Each day added to the number, and when we got out to the Buffalo  country, there were 15 to 25 on the one side of the hand and  elsewhere in proportion. On the Nyarling, in early July, the number  was increased, being now 20 to 40. On Great Slave Lake, later that  month, there were 50 to 60. But when we reached the Barren Grounds,  the land of open breezy plains and cold water lakes, the pests "]]]
