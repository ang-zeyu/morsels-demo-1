MEN    She did it all, the harlot, she  With her atrocious harlotry.    WOMEN    Nay, rather call her darling-sweet.    MEN    What, sweet? She's a rude, wicked thing.    CINESIAS    A wicked thing, as I repeat.  O Zeus, O Zeus,  Canst Thou not suddenly let loose  Some twirling hurricane to tear  Her flapping up along the air  And drop her, when she's whirled around,  Here to the ground  Neatly impaled upon the stake  That's ready upright for her sake.  _He goes out._    _Enter_ SPARTAN HERALD.    _The_ MAGISTRATE _comes forward_.    HERALD    What here gabs the Senate an' the Prytanes?  I've fetcht despatches for them.    MAGISTRATE    Are you a man  Or a monstrosity?    HERALD    My scrimp-brained lad,  I'm a herald, as ye see, who hae come frae Sparta  Anent a Peace.    MAGISTRATE    Then why do you hide that lance  That sticks out under your arms?    HERALD.    I've brought no lance.    MAGISTRATE    Then why do you turn aside and hold your cloak  So far out from your body? Is your groin swollen  With stress of travelling?    HERALD    By Castor, I'll swear  The man is wud.    MAGISTRATE    Indeed, your cloak is wide,  My rascal fellow.    HERALD    But I tell ye No!  Enow o' fleering!    MAGISTRATE    Well, what is it then?    HERALD    It's my despatch cane.    MAGISTRATE    Of course--a Spartan cane!  But speak right out. I know all this too well.  Are new privations springing up in Sparta?    HERALD    Och, hard as could be: in lofty lusty columns  Our allies stand united. We maun get Pellene.    MAGISTRATE    Whence has this evil come? Is it from Pan?    HERALD    No. Lampito first ran asklent, then the others  Sprinted after her example, and blocked, the hizzies,  Their wames unskaithed against our every fleech.    MAGISTRATE    What did you do?    HERALD    We are broken, and bent double,  Limp like men carrying lanthorns in great winds  About the city. They winna let us even  Wi' lightest neif skim their primsie pretties  Till we've concluded Peace-terms wi' a' Hellas.    MAGISTRATE    So the conspiracy is universal;  This proves it. Then return to Sparta. Bid them  Send envoys with full powers to treat of Peace;  And I will urge the Senate here to choose  Plenipotentiary ambassadors,  As argument adducing this connection.    HERALD    I'm off. Your wisdom none could contravert.  _They retire._    MEN    There is no beast, no rush of fire, like woman so untamed.  She calmly goes her way where even panthers would be shamed.    WOMEN    And yet you are fool enough, it seems, to dare to war with me,  When for your faithful ally you might win me easily.    MEN    Never could the hate I feel for womankind grow less.    WOMEN    Then have your will. But I'll take pity on your nakedness.  For I can see just how ridiculous you look, and so  Will help you with your tunic if close up I now may go.    MEN    Well, that, by Zeus, is no scoundrel-deed, I frankly will admit.  I only took them off myself in a scoundrel raging-fit.    WOMEN    Now you look sensible, and that you're men no one could doubt.  If you were but good friends again, I'd take the insect out  That hurts your eye.    MEN    Is that what's wrong? That nasty bitie thing.  Please squeeze it out, and show me what it is that makes this sting.  It's been paining me a long while now.    WOMEN    Well I'll agree to that,  Although you're most unmannerly. O what a giant gnat.  Here, look! It comes from marshy Tricorysus, I can tell.    MEN    O thank you. It was digging out a veritable well.  Now that it's gone, I can't hold back my tears. See how they fall.    WOMEN    I'll wipe them off, bad as you are, and kiss you after all.    MEN    I won't be kissed.    WOMEN    O yes, you will. Your wishes do not matter.    MEN    O botheration take you all! How you cajole and flatter.  A hell it is to live with you; to live without, a hell:  How truly was that said. But come, these enmities let's quell.  You stop from giving orders and I'll stop from doing wrong.  So let's join ranks and seal our bargain with a choric song.    CHORUS.    Athenians, it's not our intention  To sow political dissension  By giving any scandal mention;  But on the contrary to promote good feeling in the state  By word and deed. We've had enough calamities of late.  So let a man or woman but divulge  They need a trifle, say,  Two minas, three or four,  I've purses here that bulge.  There's only one condition made  (Indulge my whim in this I pray)--  When Peace is signed once more,  On no account am I to be repaid.    And I'm making preparation  For a gay select collation  With some youths of reputation.  I've managed to produce some soup and they're slaughtering for me  A sucking-pig: its flesh should taste as tender as could be.  I shall expect you at my house today.  To the baths make an early visit,  And bring your children along;  Don't dawdle on the way.  Ask no one; enter as if the place  Was all your own--yours henceforth is it.  If nothing chances wrong,  The door will then be shut bang in your face.    _The_ SPARTAN AMBASSADORS _approach_.    CHORUS    Here come the Spartan envoys with long, worried beards.  Hail, Spartans how do you fare?  Did anything new arise?    SPARTANS    No need for a clutter o' words. Do ye see our condition?    CHORUS    The situation swells to greater tension.  Something will explode soon.    SPARTANS    It's awfu' truly.  But come, let us wi' the best speed we may  Scribble a Peace.    CHORUS    I notice that our men  Like wrestlers poised for contest, hold their clothes  Out from their bellies. An athlete's malady!  Since exercise alone can bring relief.    ATHENIANS    Can anyone tell us where Lysistrata is?  There is no need to describe our men's condition,  It shows up plainly enough.    CHORUS    It's the same disease.  Do you feel a jerking throbbing in the morning?    ATHENIANS    By Zeus, yes! In these straits, I'm racked all through.  Unless Peace is soon declared, we shall be driven  In the void of women to try Cleisthenes.    CHORUS    Be wise and cover those things with your tunics.  Who knows what kind of person may perceive you?    ATHENIANS    By Zeus, you're right.    SPARTANS    By the Twa Goddesses,  Indeed ye are. Let's put our tunics on.    ATHENIANS    Hail O my fellow-sufferers, hail Spartans.    SPARTANS    O hinnie darling, what a waefu' thing!  If they had seen us wi' our lunging waddies!    ATHENIANS    Tell us then, Spartans, what has brought you here?    SPARTANS    We come to treat o' Peace.    ATHENIANS    Well spoken there!  And we the same. Let us callout Lysistrata  Since she alone can settle the Peace-terms.    SPARTANS    Callout Lysistratus too if ye don't mind.    CHORUS    No indeed. She hears your voices and she comes.    _Enter LYSISTRATA_    Hail, Wonder of all women! Now you must be in turn  Hard, shifting, clear, deceitful, noble, crafty, sweet, and stern.  The foremost men of Hellas, smitten by your fascination,  Have brought their tangled quarrels here for your sole arbitration.    LYSISTRATA    An easy task if the love's raging home-sickness  Doesn't start trying out how well each other  Will serve instead of us. But I'll know at once  If they do. O where's that girl, Reconciliation?  Bring first before me the Spartan delegates,  And see you lift no rude or violent hands--  None of the churlish ways our husbands used.  But lead them courteously, as women should.  And if they grudge fingers, guide them by other methods,  And introduce them with ready tact. The Athenians  Draw by whatever offers you a grip.  Now, Spartans, stay here facing me. Here you,  Athenians. Both hearken to my words.  I am a woman, but I'm not a fool.  And what of natural intelligence I own  Has been filled out with the remembered precepts  My father and the city-elders taught me.  First I reproach you both sides equally  That when at Pylae and Olympia,  At Pytho and the many other shrines  That I could name, you sprinkle from one cup  The altars common to all Hellenes, yet  You wrack Hellenic cities, bloody Hellas  With deaths of her own sons, while yonder clangs  The gathering menace of barbarians.    ATHENIANS    We cannot hold it in much longer now.    LYSISTRATA    Now unto you, O Spartans, do I speak.  Do you forget how your own countryman,  Pericleidas, once came hither suppliant  Before our altars, pale in his purple robes,  Praying for an army when in Messenia  Danger growled, and the Sea-god made earth quaver.  Then with four thousand hoplites Cimon marched  And saved all Sparta. Yet base ingrates now,  You are ravaging the soil of your preservers.    ATHENIANS    By Zeus, they do great wrong, Lysistrata.    SPARTANS    Great wrong, indeed. O! What a luscious wench!    LYSISTRATA    And now I turn to the Athenians.  Have you forgotten too how once the Spartans  In days when you wore slavish tunics, came  And with their spears broke a Thessalian host  And all the partisans of Hippias?  They alone stood by your shoulder on that day.  They freed you, so that for the slave's short skirt  You should wear the trailing cloak of liberty.    SPARTANS    I've never seen a nobler woman anywhere.    ATHENIANS    Nor I one with such prettily jointing hips.    LYSISTRATA    Now, brethren twined with mutual benefactions,  Can you still war, can you suffer such disgrace?  Why not be friends? What is there to prevent you?    SPARTANS    We're agreed, gin that we get this tempting Mole.    LYSISTRATA    Which one?    SPARTANS    That ane we've wanted to get into,  O for sae lang.... Pylos, of course.    ATHENIANS    By Poseidon,  Never!    LYSISTRATA    Give it up.    ATHENIANS    Then what will we do?  We need that ticklish place united to us--    LYSISTRATA    Ask for some other lurking-hole in return.    ATHENIANS    Then, ah, we'll choose this snug thing here, Echinus,  Shall we call the nestling spot? And this backside haven,  These"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/775"],[0,"When the Sleeper Wakes (#8)"],[1,"be--it is bound to be  perplexing. At present it is all so strange. Anything seems possible.  Anything. In the details even. Your counting, I understand, is  different.\"    The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long  passage between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of  tubes and big cables.    \"What a huge place this is!\" said Graham. \"Is it all one building? What  place is it?\"    \"This is one of the city ways for various public services. Light and so  forth.\"    \"Was it a social trouble--that--in the great roadway place? How are you  governed? Have you still a police?\" \"Several,\" said Howard.    \"Several?\"    \"About fourteen.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    \"Very probably not. Our social order will probably seem very complex to  you. To tell you the truth, I don't understand it myself very clearly.  Nobody does. You will, perhaps--bye and bye. We have to go to the  Council.\"    Graham's attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his  inquiries and the people in the passages and halls they were traversing.  For a moment his mind would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting  answers he made, and then he would lose the thread in response to some  vivid unexpected impression. Along the passages, in the halls, half the  people seemed to be men in the red uniform. The pale blue canvas  that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear.  Invariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as they  passed.    He had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a  number of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class. He saw  no teacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice  proceeded. The girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought, with  curiosity and astonishment. But he was hurried on before he could form a  clear idea of the gathering. He judged they knew Howard and not himself,  and that they wondered who he was. This Howard, it seemed, was a person  of importance. But then he was also merely Graham's guardian. That was  odd.    There came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung  so that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro  thereon, but no more of them. Then vague impressions of galleries and  of casual astonished passers-by turning round to stare after the two of  them with their red-clad guard.    The stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary. He was  speedily fatigued by this excessive haste. He asked Howard to slacken  his speed. Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great  street space, but this was glazed and did not open, and they were too  high for him to see the moving platforms below. But he saw people going  to and fro along cables and along strange, frail-looking ridges.    And thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it.  They crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear  that it made him giddy even to remember it. The floor of it also was of  glass. From his memory of the cliffs between New Quay and Boscastle, so  remote in time, and so recent in his experience, it seemed to him that  they must be near four hundred feet above the moving ways. He stopped,  looked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes,  minute and fore-shortened, struggling and gesticulating still towards  the little balcony far below, a little toy balcony, it seemed, where he  had so recently been standing. A thin haze and the glare of the mighty  globes of light obscured everything. A man seated in a little open-work  cradle shot by from some point still higher than the little narrow  bridge, rushing down a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling.  Graham stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in  a great circular opening below, and then his eyes went back to the  tumultuous struggle.    Along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. This  broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring  down the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central  area. These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons;  they seemed to be striking and thrusting. A great shouting, cries of  wrath, screaming, burst out and came up to Graham, faint and thin. \"Go  on,\" cried Howard, laying hands on him.    Another man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly glanced up to see  whence he came, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of  cables and girders, dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of  windmills, and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky. Then  Howard had thrust him forward across the bridge, and he was in a little  narrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns.    \"I want to see more of that,\" cried Graham, resisting.    \"No, no,\" cried Howard, still gripping his arm.    \"This way. You must go this way.\" And the men in red following them  seemed ready to enforce his orders.    Some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared  down the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that  had seemed a door to Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found  himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber. The  attendant in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter  and stood waiting.    This place had the appearance of an ante-room. He saw a number of people  in the central space, and at the opposite end a large and imposing  doorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving a  glimpse of some still larger hall beyond. He perceived white men in  red and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about those  portals.    As they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, \"The  Sleeper,\" and was aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation.  They entered another little passage in the wall of this ante-chamber,  and then he found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that  passed round the side of the great hall he had already seen through the  curtains. He entered the place at the corner, so that he received  the fullest impression of its huge proportions. The black in the wasp  uniform stood aside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valve  behind him.    Compared with any of the places Graham had see thus far, this second  hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness. On a pedestal at  the remote end, and more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a  gigantic white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe upon his  bowed shoulders. It was the first thing to strike his attention, it was  so vast, so patiently and painfully real, so white and simple. Save for  this figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the place  was a shining vacancy. The dais was remote in the greatness of the area;  it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group  of seven men who stood about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its  proportions. They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have  arisen that moment from their seats, and they were regarding Graham  steadfastly. At the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some  mechanical appliances.    Howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this  mighty labouring figure. Then he stopped. The two men in red who had  followed them into the gallery came and stood on either hand of Graham.    \"You must remain here,\" murmured Howard, \"for a few moments,\" and,  without waiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.    \"But, _why?_\" began Graham.    He moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by one of  the men in red. \"You have to wait here, Sire,\" said the man in red.    _\"Why?\"_    \"Orders, Sire.\"    \"Whose orders?\"    \"Our orders, Sire.\"    Graham looked his exasperation.    \"What place is this?\" he said presently. \"Who are those men?\"    \"They are the lords of the Council, Sire.\"    \"What Council?\"    \"_The_ Council.\"    \"Oh!\" said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other  man, went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who  stood watching him and whispering together.    The Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer  had arrived he had not observed. They made no gestures of greeting; they  stood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might  have stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly  floated into view. What council could it be that gathered there, that  little body of men beneath the significant white Atlas, secluded from  every eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness? And why should he  be brought to them, and be looked at strangely and spoken of inaudibly?  Howard appeared beneath, walking quickly across the polished floor  towards them. As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar  movements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then he ascended the  steps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table.    Graham watched that visible inaudible conversation. Occasionally, one  of the white-robed men would glance towards him. He strained his ears  in vain. The gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated. He  glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants.... When he  looked again Howard was extending his hands and moving his head like  a man who protests. He was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the  white-robed men rapping the table.    The conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham's sense. His  eyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the Council sat. Thence they  wandered at last to the walls of the hall. It was decorated in long  painted panels of a quasi-Japanese type, many of them very beautiful.  These panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark  metal, which passed into the metallic"]]]
