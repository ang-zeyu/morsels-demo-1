[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],[0,"The Amateur Cracksman (#8)"],[1," in hell did you get hold o' that?\" asked Rosenthall, with a  rattle in his thick neck, meant for mirth.    \"You may well arst,\" says Raffles.  \"It's all over the plice w'ere _I_  come from.\"    \"Who can have spread such rot?\"    \"I dunno,\" says Raffles; \"arst the gen'leman on yer left; p'r'aps 'E  knows.\"    The gentleman on his left had turned livid with emotion.  Guilty  conscience never declared itself in plainer terms.  For a moment his  small eyes bulged like currants in the suet of his face; the next, he  had pocketed his pistols on a professional instinct, and was upon us  with his fists.    \"Out o' the light--out o' the light!\" yelled Rosenthall in a frenzy.    He was too late.  No sooner had the burly pugilist obstructed his fire  than Raffles was through the window at a bound; while I, for standing  still and saying nothing, was scientifically felled to the floor.      I cannot have been many moments without my senses.  When I recovered  them there was a great to-do in the garden, but I had the drawing-room  to myself.  I sat up.  Rosenthall and Purvis were rushing about  outside, cursing the Kaffirs and nagging at each other.    \"Over THAT wall, I tell yer!\"    \"I tell you it was this one.  Can't you whistle for the police?\"    \"Police be damned!  I've had enough of the blessed police.\"    \"Then we'd better get back and make sure of the other rotter.\"    \"Oh, make sure o' yer skin.  That's what you'd better do.  Jala, you  black hog, if I catch YOU skulkin'....\"    I never heard the threat.  I was creeping from the drawing-room on my  hands and knees, my own revolver swinging by its steel ring from my  teeth.    For an instant I thought that the hall also was deserted.  I was wrong,  and I crept upon a Kaffir on all fours.  Poor devil, I could not bring  myself to deal him a base blow, but I threatened him most hideously  with my revolver, and left the white teeth chattering in his black head  as I took the stairs three at a time.  Why I went upstairs in that  decisive fashion, as though it were my only course, I cannot explain.  But garden and ground floor seemed alive with men, and I might have  done worse.    I turned into the first room I came to.  It was a bedroom--empty,  though lit up; and never shall I forget how I started as I entered, on  encountering the awful villain that was myself at full length in a  pier-glass!  Masked, armed, and ragged, I was indeed fit carrion for a  bullet or the hangman, and to one or the other I made up my mind.  Nevertheless, I hid myself in the wardrobe behind the mirror; and there  I stood shivering and cursing my fate, my folly, and Raffles most of  all--Raffles first and last--for I daresay half an hour.  Then the  wardrobe door was flung suddenly open; they had stolen into the room  without a sound; and I was hauled downstairs, an ignominious captive.    Gross scenes followed in the hall; the ladies were now upon the stage,  and at sight of the desperate criminal they screamed with one accord.  In truth I must have given them fair cause, though my mask was now torn  away and hid nothing but my left ear.  Rosenthall answered their  shrieks with a roar for silence; the woman with the bath-sponge hair  swore at him shrilly in return; the place became a Babel impossible to  describe.  I remember wondering how long it would be before the police  appeared.  Purvis and the ladies were for calling them in and giving me  in charge without delay.  Rosenthall would not hear of it.  He swore  that he would shoot man or woman who left his sight.  He had had enough  of the police.  He was not going to have them coming there to spoil  sport; he was going to deal with me in his own way.  With that he  dragged me from all other hands, flung me against a door, and sent a  bullet crashing through the wood within an inch of my ear.    \"You drunken fool!  It'll be murder!\" shouted Purvis, getting in the  way a second time.    \"Wha' do I care?  He's armed, isn't he?  I shot him in self-defence.  It'll be a warning to others.  Will you stand aside, or d'ye want it  yourself?\"    \"You're drunk,\" said Purvis, still between us. \"I saw you take a neat  tumblerful since you come in, and it's made you drunk as a fool.  Pull  yourself together, old man.  You ain't a-going to do what you'll be  sorry for.\"    \"Then I won't shoot at him, I'll only shoot roun' an' roun' the beggar.  You're quite right, ole feller.  Wouldn't hurt him.  Great mishtake.  Roun' an' roun'.  There--like that!\"    His freckled paw shot up over Purvis's shoulder, mauve lightning came  from his ring, a red flash from his revolver, and shrieks from the  women as the reverberations died away.  Some splinters lodged in my  hair.    Next instant the prize-fighter disarmed him; and I was safe from the  devil, but finally doomed to the deep sea.  A policeman was in our  midst. He had entered through the drawing-room window; he was an  officer of few words and creditable promptitude.  In a twinkling he had  the handcuffs on my wrists, while the pugilist explained the situation,  and his patron reviled the force and its representative with impotent  malignity.  A fine watch they kept; a lot of good they did; coming in  when all was over and the whole household might have been murdered in  their sleep.  The officer only deigned to notice him as he marched me  off.    \"We know all about YOU, sir,\" said he contemptuously, and he refused  the sovereign Purvis proffered.  \"You will be seeing me again, sir, at  Marylebone.\"    \"Shall I come now?\"    \"As you please, sir.  I rather think the other gentleman requires you  more, and I don't fancy this young man means to give much trouble.\"    \"Oh, I'm coming quietly,\" I said.    And I went.    In silence we traversed perhaps a hundred yards. It must have been  midnight.  We did not meet a soul.  At last I whispered:    \"How on earth did you manage it?\"    \"Purely by luck,\" said Raffles.  \"I had the luck to get clear away  through knowing every brick of those back-garden walls, and the double  luck to have these togs with the rest over at Chelsea.  The helmet is  one of a collection I made up at Oxford; here it goes over this wall,  and we'd better carry the coat and belt before we meet a real officer.  I got them once for a fancy ball--ostensibly--and thereby hangs a yarn.  I always thought they might come in useful a second time.  My chief  crux to-night was getting rid of the hansom that brought me back.  I  sent him off to Scotland Yard with ten bob and a special message to  good old Mackenzie.  The whole detective department will be at  Rosenthall's in about half an hour.  Of course, I speculated on our  gentleman's hatred of the police--another huge slice of luck.  If you'd  got away, well and good; if not, I felt he was the man to play with his  mouse as long as possible. Yes, Bunny, it's been more of a costume  piece than I intended, and we've come out of it with a good deal less  credit.  But, by Jove, we're jolly lucky to have come out of it at all!\"        GENTLEMEN AND PLAYERS    Old Raffles may or may not have been an exceptional criminal, but as a  cricketer I dare swear he was unique.  Himself a dangerous bat, a  brilliant field, and perhaps the very finest slow bowler of his decade,  he took incredibly little interest in the game at large.  He never went  up to Lord's without his cricket-bag, or showed the slightest interest  in the result of a match in which he was not himself engaged.  Nor was  this mere hateful egotism on his part.  He professed to have lost all  enthusiasm for the game, and to keep it up only from the very lowest  motives.    \"Cricket,\" said Raffles, \"like everything else, is good enough sport  until you discover a better.  As a source of excitement it isn't in it  with other things you wot of, Bunny, and the involuntary comparison  becomes a bore.  What's the satisfaction of taking a man's wicket when  you want his spoons?  Still, if you can bowl a bit your low cunning  won't get rusty, and always looking for the weak spot's just the kind  of mental exercise one wants.  Yes, perhaps there's some affinity  between the two things after all.  But I'd chuck up cricket to-morrow,  Bunny, if it wasn't for the glorious protection it affords a person of  my proclivities.\"    \"How so?\" said I.  \"It brings you before the public, I should have  thought, far more than is either safe or wise.\"    \"My dear Bunny, that's exactly where you make a mistake.  To follow  Crime with reasonable impunity you simply MUST have a parallel,  ostensible career--the more public the better.  The principle is  obvious.  Mr. Peace, of pious memory, disarmed suspicion by acquiring a  local reputation for playing the fiddle and taming animals, and it's my  profound conviction that Jack the Ripper was a really eminent public  man, whose speeches were very likely reported alongside his atrocities.  Fill the bill in some prominent part, and you'll never be suspected of  doubling it with another of equal prominence.  That's why I want you to  cultivate journalism, my boy, and sign all you can.  And it's the one  and only reason why I don't burn my bats for firewood.\"    Nevertheless, when he did play there was no keener performer on the  field, nor one more anxious to do well for his side.  I remember how he  went to the nets, before the first match of the season, with his pocket  full of sovereigns, which he put on the stumps instead of bails.  It  was a sight to see the professionals bowling like demons for the hard  cash, for whenever a stump was hit a pound was tossed to the bowler and  another balanced in its stead, while one man took Â£3 with a ball that  spreadeagled the wicket.  Raffles's practice cost him either eight or  nine sovereigns; but he had absolutely first-class bowling all the  time; and he made fifty-seven runs next day.    It became my pleasure to accompany him to all his matches, to watch  every ball he bowled, or played, or fielded, and to sit chatting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#8)"],[1,"found to be complete, and the guards on the other two roads  had also ridden in. Guy, to his great satisfaction, had been ordered by  Sir Eustace to don his armour and to take his place beside him.    It was upwards of an hour before a body of horsemen could be heard  approaching. They came at a leisurely pace, for the bonfire on the road  and that on the keep had apprised them that their hope of taking the  castle by surprise had been frustrated by the disobedience of some of  their men, who, in defiance of the strictest orders to the contrary, had  set fire to several houses in the village after having plundered them. Sir  Eustace, accompanied by his esquire and Guy, descended from the wall and  crossed the drawbridge to the outwork. As soon as the horsemen came within  bow-shot of the castle they lighted some torches, and three knights,  preceded by a trooper carrying a white flag, and two others with torches,  came towards the work. When within fifty yards of the postern they halted.    \"Is Sieur Eustace de Villeroy present?\"    \"I am here,\" Sir Eustace replied, and at his order two men with torches  took their place one on each side of him. \"Who are you that approach my  castle in armed force?\"    \"I am Sir Clugnet de Brabant, Admiral of France. These are Sir Manessier  Guieret and Sir Hugh de Fruges, and we come in the name of the Duke of  Orleans to summon you to admit a garrison of his highness's troops.\"    \"I am neither for Orleans nor for Burgundy,\" Sir Eustace replied. \"I am a  simple knight, holding my castle and estate as a vassal of the crown, and  am ready to obey the orders of the king,--and of him only when he is in a  condition of mind to give such orders. Until then I shall hold my castle,  and will admit no garrison whether of Orleans or of Burgundy.\"    \"We hold you to be but a false vassal of the crown, and we are told that  at heart you are an enemy to France and devoted to England.\"    \"I am a vassal of England for the estates of my wife in that country,\" Sir  Eustace said; \"and as at present there is a truce between the two nations,  I can serve here the King of France as faithfully as if, in England, I  should serve the King of England.\"    \"Nevertheless, Sir Eustace, you will have to receive a garrison of  Orleans. I have at my back eight thousand men, and if you compel me to  storm this hold of yours I warn you that all within its walls will be put  to the sword.\"    \"Thanks for your warning, Sir Knight; and I on my part warn you that,  eight thousand though you be, I shall resist you to the death, and that  you will not carry eight thousand away. As for Sir Hugh de Fruges, I give  him my open defiance. I know it is to him that I owe this raid; and if he  be man enough, I challenge him to meet me in the morning on fair ground  outside this postern, with lance and battle-axe, to fight to the death. If  he conquers, my castle shall be surrendered to him, upon promise of good  treatment and a safe-conduct to depart where they will for all within it;  but if I slay him, you must give me your knightly oath that you and your  following will depart forthwith.\"    \"The conditions would be hardly fair, Sir Eustace,\" Sir Clugnet said; \"and  though I doubt not that Sir Hugh would gladly accept them, I cannot permit  him to do so. I have brought some eight thousand men here to capture this  castle, and hold it for the Duke of Orleans, and I see not why I should  march away with them because you may perchance prove a better fighter than  Sir Hugh. I am ready, however, to give a safe-conduct to all within the  walls if you will surrender.\"    \"That will I not do, Sir Clugnet. I hold this castle neither for Burgundy  nor Orleans, and am ready to give pledge that I will not draw sword for  either of these princes; but if that will not content you, you must even  take my castle if you can, and I give you fair warning that it will cost  you dear.\"    \"Then adieu, Sir Knight, until to-morrow morning, when we will talk in  other fashion.\"    \"So be it,\" Sir Eustace replied, \"you will not find me backward in  returning any courtesies you may pay me.\"    The knights turned away with their torch-bearers.    \"Keep a close watch to-night, Bouvard,\" Sir Eustace said. \"Mark you what  the knight said,--adieu till the morning. Had I to deal with a loyal  gentleman I could have slept soundly, but with these adventurers it is  different. It may be that he truly does not intend to attack till morning,  but it is more likely that he used the words in order to throw us off our  guard.\"    \"We will keep close ward, Sir Eustace. All the men-at-arms have their  cross-bows, and though I say not that they can shoot like these English  archers, they can shoot straight enough to do good work should those  fellows attempt in force to cross the small moat and attack the gate. But  if they come, methinks it will be but to try if we are wakeful; 'tis no  light thing to attack even an outwork like this, with this loop from the  moat surrounding it, without previous examination of the ground and  reconnoitring of the castle.\"    \"They would not attempt to attack the fortress itself,\" Sir Eustace said;  \"but if they could seize this outwork by surprise it would mightily aid  them in their attack on the fortress; at any rate I will send down five  archers, and if any of the enemy crawl up to see how wide the water is  here, and how the attempt had best be made, I warrant that they will not  return if the archers can but get a sight of them. Post half your men on  the wall, and let the others sleep; change them every two hours--we want  no sleepy heads in the morning.\"    By this time the confused sound of a large number of men marching could be  made out, and a quarter of an hour later three or four cottages, some five  hundred yards away, were fired, and an angry murmur broke from the men as  the flames shot up. After sending down the five archers, Sir Eustace  returned to his post over the main gate.    \"Get cressets and torches in readiness to light if they attack the  postern,\" Sir Eustace said; \"we must have light to see how things go, so  that we may hoist the drawbridge as soon as our men are upon it, should  the enemy get the better of them. Be sure that one is not left behind; it  were better that half a dozen of the enemy set foot on the drawbridge than  that one of our brave fellows should be sacrificed.\"    \"I should think that there is no fear of their attacking until those  flames have burnt down; we should see them against the light,\" John Harpen  said.    \"No, there is no fear of their attacking; but the fire would be of  advantage if any men were crawling up to spy. Of course they would not  cross the slope in a line with the fire, but would work along on either  side, reckoning, and with reason, that as our men would have the light in  their eyes they would be all the less likely to make out objects crawling  along in the shade by the side of the moat. Plant half a dozen bowmen at  intervals on the wall, Tom, and tell them to keep a shrewd eye on the  ground near the moat, and if they see aught moving there to try it with an  arrow.\"    There was shouting and noise up by the burning cottages, where the enemy  were feasting on the spoils they had taken, and drinking from the wine-barrels that had been brought with them in carts from the last village  that they had plundered.     \"I wish we were somewhat stronger, or they somewhat weaker,\" Sir Eustace  said; \"were it so, we would make a sally, and give the knaves a sharp  lesson, but with only two hundred men against their eight thousand it  would be madness to try it; we might slay a good many, but might lose a  score before we were back in the castle, and it would be a heavy loss to  us.\"    \"I was thinking that myself, Sir Eustace,\" his esquire said. \"That is the  worst of being on the defence; one sees such chances but cannot avail  one's self of them.\"    In the castle everything was quiet, and all those not on duty were already  asleep. Along the wall watchers stood at short intervals peering into the  darkness, but the main body there were also stretched on the wall with  their arms by their side until required to be up and doing. Now that Sir  Eustace was himself at the gate his esquire went round the walls at short  intervals to be sure that the men on watch were vigilant. Presently a loud  cry was heard from the corner of the moat away to the right.    \"Go and see what is doing, Guy,\" Sir Eustace said, \"and bring me news.\"    Guy ran along to the angle of the wall. Here one of the archers was  posted.    \"What is it, Dickon?\"    \"A man crept up to that corner opposite, Master Guy. I could not have  sworn to him, it is so pesky dark, but I thought there was something  moving there and shot almost at a venture, for I could scarce see the end  of my arrow; but it hit there or thereabouts, for I heard him shout. A  moment later he was on his feet and running. I could see him more plainly  then, so I shot again, and over he went. I fancy that in the morning you  will see my arrow sticking up somewhere between his shoulder-blades,  though there is no saying precisely, for a nicety of shooting is not to be  looked for in the dark.\"    \"You have done very well, Dickon. Keep your eyes open; we may be sure  there are more than one of these fellows about.\"    Guy hurried back with the news.    \"That is good,\" said Sir Eustace, \"and it was just as well that the archer  did not kill him outright with his first arrow, the cry will show any of  his comrades who may be about that they had best keep their distance from  the walls.\"    A minute's silence followed, and then Long Tom said, \"There is another has  had his lesson, Sir Eustace. I heard a bow twang across there, and as  there was no cry you may be sure that the shaft sped straight, and that  the man had no time to utter one.\"    \"He may have been missed altogether, Tom.\"    \"Missed altogether! no indeed,"]]]
