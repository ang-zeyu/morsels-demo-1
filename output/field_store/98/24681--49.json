All this Was strange and new to Kazan. Pierre's hand, as well as the  girl's, stroked his head. It was the man who brought him a gruel of meal  and tallow, and urged him to eat, while Joan sat with her chin in her  two hands, looking at the dog, and talking to him. After this, when he  was quite comfortable, and no longer afraid, he heard a strange small  cry from the furry bundle on the sledge that brought his head up with a  jerk.    Joan saw the movement, and heard the low answering whimper in his  throat. She turned quickly to the bundle, talking and cooing to it as  she took it in her arms, and then she pulled back the bearskin so that  Kazan could see. He had never seen a baby before, and Joan held it out  before him, so that he could look straight at it and see what a  wonderful creature it was. Its little pink face stared steadily at  Kazan. Its tiny fists reached out, and it made queer little sounds at  him, and then suddenly it kicked and screamed with delight and laughed.  At those sounds Kazan's whole body relaxed, and he dragged himself to  the girl's feet.    \"See, he likes the baby!\" she cried. \"_Mon pere_, we must give him a  name. What shall it be?\"    \"Wait till morning for that,\" replied the father. \"It is late, Joan. Go  into the tent, and sleep. We have no dogs now, and will travel slowly.  So we must start early.\"    With her hand on the tent-flap, Joan, turned.    \"He came with the wolves,\" she said. \"Let us call him Wolf.\" With one  arm she was holding the little Joan. The other she stretched out to  Kazan. \"Wolf! Wolf!\" she called softly.    Kazan's eyes were on her. He knew that she was speaking to him, and he  drew himself a foot toward her.    \"He knows it already!\" she cried. \"Good night, _mon pere_.\"    For a long time after she had gone into the tent, old Pierre Radisson  sat on the edge of the sledge, facing the fire, with Kazan at his feet.  Suddenly the silence was broken again by Gray Wolf's lonely howl deep in  the forest. Kazan lifted his head and whined.    \"She's calling for you, boy,\" said Pierre understandingly.    He coughed, and clutched a hand to his breast, where the pain seemed  rending him.    \"Frost-bitten lung,\" he said, speaking straight at Kazan. \"Got it early  in the winter, up at Fond du Lac. Hope we'll get home--in time--with the  kids.\"    In the loneliness and emptiness of the big northern wilderness one falls  into the habit of talking to one's self. But Kazan's head was alert, and  his eyes watchful, so Pierre spoke to him.    \"We've got to get them home, and there's only you and me to do it,\" he  said, twisting his beard. Suddenly he clenched his fists.    His hollow racking cough convulsed him again.    \"Home!\" he panted, clutching his chest. \"It's eighty miles straight  north--to the Churchill--and I pray to God we'll get there--with the  kids--before my lungs give out.\"    He rose to his feet, and staggered a little as he walked. There was a  collar about Kazan's neck, and he chained him to the sledge. After that  he dragged three or four small logs upon the fire, and went quietly into  the tent where Joan and the baby were already asleep. Several times  that night Kazan heard the distant voice of Gray Wolf calling for him,  but something told him that he must not answer it now. Toward dawn Gray  Wolf came close in to the camp, and for the first time Kazan replied to  her.    His howl awakened the man. He came out of the tent, peered for a few  moments up at the sky, built up the fire, and began to prepare  breakfast. He patted Kazan on the head, and gave him a chunk of meat.  Joan came out a few moments later, leaving the baby asleep in the tent.  She ran up and kissed Pierre, and then dropped down on her knees beside  Kazan, and talked to him almost as he had heard her talk to the baby.  When she jumped up to help her father, Kazan followed her, and when Joan  saw him standing firmly upon his legs she gave a cry of pleasure.    It was a strange journey that began into the North that day. Pierre  Radisson emptied the sledge of everything but the tent, blankets, food  and the furry nest for baby Joan. Then he harnessed himself in the  traces and dragged the sledge over the snow. He coughed incessantly.    \"It's a cough I've had half the winter,\" lied Pierre, careful that Joan  saw no sign of blood on his lips or beard. \"I'll keep in the cabin for a  week when we get home.\"    Even Kazan, with that strange beast knowledge which man, unable to  explain, calls instinct, knew that what he said was not the truth.  Perhaps it was largely because he had heard other men cough like this,  and that for generations his sledge-dog ancestors had heard men cough as  Radisson coughed--and had learned what followed it.    More than once he had scented death in tepees and cabins, which he had  not entered, and more than once he had sniffed at the mystery of death  that was not quite present, but near--just as he had caught at a  distance the subtle warning of storm and of fire. And that strange thing  seemed to be very near to him now, as he followed at the end of his  chain behind the sledge. It made him restless, and half a dozen times,  when the sledge stopped, he sniffed at the bit of humanity buried in the  bearskin. Each time that he did this Joan was quickly at his side, and  twice she patted his scarred and grizzled head until every drop of  blood in his body leaped riotously with a joy which his body did not  reveal.    This day the chief thing that he came to understand was that the little  creature on the sledge was very precious to the girl who stroked his  head and talked to him, and that it was very helpless. He learned, too,  that Joan was most delighted, and that her voice was softer and thrilled  him more deeply, when he paid attention to that little, warm, living  thing in the bearskin.    For a long time after they made camp Pierre Radisson sat beside the  fire. To-night he did not smoke. He stared straight into the flames.  When at last he rose to go into the tent with the girl and the baby, he  bent over Kazan and examined his hurt.    \"You've got to work in the traces to-morrow, boy,\" he said. \"We must  make the river by to-morrow night. If we don't--\"    He did not finish. He was choking back one of those tearing coughs when  the tent-flap dropped behind him. Kazan lay stiff and alert, his eyes  filled with a strange anxiety. He did not like to see Radisson enter the  tent, for stronger than ever there hung that oppressive mystery in the  air about him, and it seemed to be a part of Pierre.    Three times that night he heard faithful Gray Wolf calling for him deep  in the forest, and each time he answered her. Toward dawn she came in  close to camp. Once he caught the scent of her when she circled around  in the wind, and he tugged and whined at the end of his chain, hoping  that she would come in and lie down at his side. But no sooner had  Radisson moved in the tent than Gray Wolf was gone. The man's face was  thinner, and his eyes were redder this morning. His cough was not so  loud or so rending. It was like a wheeze, as if something had given way  inside, and before the girl came out he clutched his hands often at his  throat. Joan's face whitened when she saw him. Anxiety gave way to fear  in her eyes. Pierre Radisson laughed when she flung her arms about him,  and coughed to prove that what he said was true.    \"You see the cough is not so bad, my Joan,\" he said. \"It is breaking up.  You can not have forgotten, _ma cheri_? It always leaves one red-eyed  and weak.\"    It was a cold bleak dark day that followed, and through it Kazan and  the man tugged at the fore of the sledge, with Joan following in the  trail behind. Kazan's wound no longer hurt him. He pulled steadily with  all his splendid strength, and the man never lashed him once, but patted  him with his mittened hand on head and back. The day grew steadily  darker and in the tops of the trees there was the low moaning of a  storm.    Darkness and the coming of the storm did not drive Pierre Radisson into  camp. \"We must reach the river,\" he said to himself over and over again.  \"We must reach the river--we must reach the river--\" And he steadily  urged Kazan on to greater effort, while his own strength at the end of  the traces grew less.    It had begun to storm when Pierre stopped to build a fire at noon. The  snow fell straight down in a white deluge so thick that it hid the tree  trunks fifty yards away. Pierre laughed when Joan shivered and snuggled  close up to him with the baby in her arms. He waited only an hour, and  then fastened Kazan in the traces again, and buckled the straps once  more about his own waist. In the silent gloom that was almost night  Pierre carried his compass in his hand, and at last, late in the  afternoon, they came to a break in the timber-line, and ahead of them  lay a plain, across which Radisson pointed an exultant hand.    \"There's the river, Joan,\" he said, his voice faint and husky. \"We can  camp here now and wait for the storm to pass.\"    Under a thick clump of spruce he put up the tent, and then began  gathering fire-wood. Joan helped him. As soon as they had boiled coffee  and eaten a supper of meat and toasted biscuits, Joan went into the tent  and dropped exhausted on her thick bed of balsam boughs, wrapping  herself and the baby up close in the skins and blankets. To-night she  had no word for Kazan. And Pierre was glad that she was too tired to sit  beside the fire and talk. And yet--    Kazan's alert eyes saw Pierre start suddenly. He rose from his seat on  the sledge and went to the tent. He drew back the flap and thrust in his  head and shoulders.    \"Asleep, Joan?\" he asked.    \"Almost, father.

However, nothing was effected, and the cities  never assembled, in consequence it is said of the covert hostility of  the Lacedaemonians, and because the attempt was first made in  Peloponnesus and failed there: yet I have inserted an account of it in  order to show the lofty spirit and the magnificent designs of Pericles.    In his campaigns he was chiefly remarkable for caution, for he would  not, if he could help it, begin a battle of which the issue was  doubtful; nor did he wish to emulate those generals who have won  themselves a great reputation by running risks and trusting to good  luck. But he ever used to say to his countrymen, that none of them  should come by their deaths through any act of his. Observing that  Tolmides, the son of Tolmaeus, elated by previous successes and by the  credit which he had gained as a general, was about to invade Boeotia in  a reckless manner, and had persuaded a thousand young men to follow him  without any support whatever, he endeavored to stop him, and made that  memorable saying in the public assembly, that if Tolmides would not take  the advice of Pericles, he would at any rate do well to consult that  best of advisers, Time. This speech had but little success at the time;  but when, a few days afterward, the news came that Tolmides had fallen  in action at Coronea, and many noble citizens with him, Pericles was  greatly respected and admired as a wise and patriotic man.    His most successful campaign was that in the Chersonesus, which proved  the salvation of the Greeks residing there: for he not only settled a  thousand colonists there, and thus increased the available force of the  cities, but built a continuous line of fortifications reaching across  the isthmus from one sea to the other, by which he shut off the  Thracians, who had previously ravaged the peninsula, and put an end to a  constant and harassing border warfare to which the settlers were  exposed, as they had for neighbors tribes of wild plundering barbarians.    But that by which he obtained most glory and renown was when he started  from Pegae, in the Megarian territory, and sailed round the Peloponnesus  with a fleet of a hundred triremes; for he not only laid waste much of  the country near the coast, as Tolmides had previously done, but he  proceeded far inland, away from his ships, leading the troops who were  on board, and terrified the inhabitants so much that they shut  themselves up in their strongholds. The men of Sicyon alone ventured to  meet him at Nemea, and them he overthrew in a pitched battle, and  erected a trophy. Next he took on board troops from the friendly  district of Achaia, and, crossing over to the opposite side of the  Corinthian Gulf, coasted along past the mouth of the river Achelous,  overran Acarnania, drove the people of Oeneadae to the shelter of their  city walls, and after ravaging the country returned home, having made  himself a terror to his enemies, and done good service to Athens; for  not the least casualty, even by accident, befell the troops under his  command.    When he sailed into the Black Sea with a great and splendidly equipped  fleet, he assisted the Greek cities there, and treated them with  consideration, and showed the neighboring savage tribes and their chiefs  the greatness of his force, and his confidence in his power, by sailing  where he pleased, and taking complete control over that sea. He left at  Sinope thirteen ships, and a land force under the command of Lamachus,  to act against Timesileon, who had made himself despot of that city.  When he and his party were driven out, Pericles passed a decree that six  hundred Athenian volunteers should sail to Sinope, and become citizens  there, receiving the houses and lands which had formerly been in the  possession of the despot and his party. But in other cases he would not  agree to the impulsive proposals of the Athenians, and he opposed them  when, elated by their power and good fortune, they talked of recovering  Egypt and attacking the seaboard of the Persian empire. Many, too, were  inflamed with that ill-starred notion of an attempt on Sicily, which was  afterward blown into a flame by Alcibiades and other orators. Some even  dreamed of the conquest of Etruria and Carthage, in consequence of the  greatness which the Athenian empire had already reached, and the full  tide of success which seemed to attend it.    Pericles, however, restrained these outbursts, and would not allow the  people to meddle with foreign states, but used the power of Athens  chiefly to preserve and guard her already existing empire, thinking it  to be of paramount importance to oppose the Lacedaemonians, a task to  which he bent all his energies, as is proved by many of his acts,  especially in connection with the Sacred War. In this war the  Lacedaemonians sent a force to Delphi, and made the Phocians, who held  it, give it up to the people of Delphi: but as soon as they were gone  Pericles made an expedition into the country, and restored the temple to  the Phocians; and as the Lacedaemonians had scratched the oracle which  the Delphians had given them, on the forehead of the brazen wolf there,  Pericles got a response from the oracle for the Athenians, and carved it  on the right side of the same wolf.    Events proved that Pericles was right in confining the Athenian empire  to Greece. First of all Euboea revolted, and he was obliged to lead an  army to subdue that island. Shortly after this, news came that the  Megarians had become hostile, and that an army, under the command of  Plistoanax, king of the Lacedaemonians, was menacing the frontier of  Attica. Pericles now in all haste withdrew his troops from Euboea, to  meet the invader. He did not venture on an engagement with the numerous  and warlike forces of the enemy, although repeatedly invited by them to  fight: but, observing that Plistoanax was a very young man, and entirely  under the influence of Cleandrides, whom the _ephors_ had sent to act as  his tutor and counsellor because of his tender years, he opened secret  negotiations with the latter, who at once, for a bribe, agreed to  withdraw the Peloponnesians from Attica. When their army returned and  dispersed, the Lacedaemonians were so incensed that they imposed a fine  on their king, and condemned Cleandrides, who fled the country, to be  put to death. This Cleandrides was the father of Gylippus, who caused  the ruin of the Athenian expedition in Sicily. Avarice seems to have  been hereditary in the family, for Gylippus himself, after brilliant  exploits in war, was convicted of taking bribes, and banished from  Sparta in disgrace.    When Pericles submitted the accounts of the campaign to the people,  there was an item of ten talents, \"for a necessary purpose,\" which the  people passed without any questioning, or any curiosity to learn the  secret. Some historians, among whom is Theophrastus the philosopher, say  that Pericles sent ten talents annually to Sparta, by means of which he  bribed the chief magistrates to defer the war, thus not buying peace,  but time to make preparations for a better defence. He immediately  turned his attention to the insurgents in Euboea, and proceeding thither  with a fleet of fifty sail, and five thousand heavy armed troops, he  reduced their cities to submission. He banished from Chalcis the  \"equestrian order,\" as it was called, consisting of men of wealth and  station; and he drove all the inhabitants of Hestiaea out of their  country, replacing them by Athenian settlers. He treated these people  with this pitiless severity, because they had captured an Athenian ship,  and put its crew to the sword. After this, as the Athenians and  Lacedaemonians made a truce for thirty years, Pericles decreed the  expedition against Samos, on the pretext that they had disregarded the  commands of the Athenians to cease from their war with the Milesians.    Pericles is accused of going to war with Samos to save the Milesians.  These states were at war about the possession of the city of Priene, and  the Samians, who were victorious, would not lay down their arms and  allow the Athenians to settle the matter by arbitration, as they ordered  them to do. For this reason Pericles proceeded to Samos, put an end to  the oligarchical form of government there, and sent fifty hostages and  as many children to Lemnos, to insure the good behavior of the leading  men. It is said that each of these hostages offered him a talent for his  own freedom, and that much more was offered by that party which was  loath to see a democracy established in the city. Besides all this,  Pissuthnes the Persian, who had a liking for the Samians, sent and  offered him ten thousand pieces of gold if he would spare the city.  Pericles, however, took none of these bribes, but dealt with Samos as he  had previously determined, and returned to Athens. The Samians now at  once revolted, as Pissuthnes managed to get them back their hostages,  and furnished them with the means of carrying on the war. Pericles now  made a second expedition against them, and found them in no mind to  submit quietly, but determined to dispute the empire of the seas with  the Athenians. Pericles gained a signal victory over them in a sea-fight  off the Goats' Island, beating a fleet of seventy ships with only  forty-four, twenty of which were transports.    Simultaneously with his victory and the flight of the enemy he obtained  command of the harbor of Samos, and besieged the Samians in their city.  They, in spite of their defeat, still possessed courage enough to sally  out and fight a battle under the walls; but soon a larger force arrived  from Athens, and the Samians were completely blockaded.    Pericles now with sixty ships sailed out of the"]]]
