These were the requisites for the quest that these men used to advise:  a horse, a boat, mail armour, and at least three men-at-arms. Some  said, \"Blow the horn at the tower door\"; others said, \"Do not touch  it.\"    Alderic thus decided: he would take no horse down to the river's edge,  he would not row along it in a boat, and he would go alone and by way  of the Forest Unpassable.    How pass, you may say, the unpassable? This was his plan: there was a  dragon he knew of who if peasants' prayers are heeded deserved to die,  not alone because of the number of maidens he cruelly slew, but  because he was bad for the crops; he ravaged the very land and was the  bane of a dukedom.    Now Alderic determined to go up against him. So he took horse and  spear and pricked till he met the dragon, and the dragon came out  against him breathing bitter smoke. And to him Alderic shouted, \"Hath  foul dragon ever slain true knight?\" And well the dragon knew that  this had never been, and he hung his head and was silent, for he was  glutted with blood. \"Then,\" said the knight, \"if thou would'st ever  taste maiden's blood again thou shalt be my trusty steed, and if not,  by this spear there shall befall thee all that the troubadours tell of  the dooms of thy breed.\"    And the dragon did not open his ravening mouth, nor rush upon the  knight, breathing out fire; for well he knew the fate of those that  did these things, but he consented to the terms imposed, and swore to  the knight to become his trusty steed.    It was on a saddle upon this dragon's back that Alderic afterwards  sailed above the unpassable forest, even above the tops of those  measureless trees, children of wonder. But first he pondered that  subtle plan of his which was more profound than merely to avoid all  that had been done before; and he commanded a blacksmith, and the  blacksmith made him a pickaxe.    Now there was great rejoicing at the rumour of Alderic's quest, for  all folk knew that he was a cautious man, and they deemed that he  would succeed and enrich the world, and they rubbed their hands in the  cities at the thought of largesse; and there was joy among all men in  Alderic's country, except perchance among the lenders of money, who  feared they would soon be paid. And there was rejoicing also because  men hoped that when the Gibbelins were robbed of their hoard, they  would shatter their high-built bridge and break the golden chains that  bound them to the world, and drift back, they and their tower, to the  moon, from which they had come and to which they rightly belonged.  There was little love for the Gibbelins, though all men envied their  hoard.    So they all cheered, that day when he mounted his dragon, as though he  was already a conqueror, and what pleased them more than the good that  they hoped he would do to the world was that he scattered gold as he  rode away; for he would not need it, he said, if he found the  Gibbelins' hoard, and he would not need it more if he smoked on the  Gibbelins' table.    When they heard that he had rejected the advice of those that gave it,  some said that the knight was mad, and others said he was greater than  those what gave the advice, but none appreciated the worth of his  plan.    He reasoned thus: for centuries men had been well advised and had gone  by the cleverest way, while the Gibbelins came to expect them to come  by boat and to look for them at the door whenever their larder was  empty, even as a man looketh for a snipe in a marsh; but how, said  Alderic, if a snipe should sit in the top of a tree, and would men  find him there? Assuredly never! So Alderic decided to swim the river  and not to go by the door, but to pick his way into the tower through  the stone. Moreover, it was in his mind to work below the level of the  ocean, the river (as Homer knew) that girdles the world, so that as  soon as he made a hole in the wall the water should pour in,  confounding the Gibbelins, and flooding the cellars, rumoured to be  twenty feet in depth, and therein he would dive for emeralds as a  diver dives for pearls.    And on the day that I tell of he galloped away from his home  scattering largesse of gold, as I have said, and passed through many  kingdoms, the dragon snapping at maidens as he went, but being unable  to eat them because of the bit in his mouth, and earning no gentler  reward than a spurthrust where he was softest. And so they came to the  swart arboreal precipice of the unpassable forest. The dragon rose at  it with a rattle of wings. Many a farmer near the edge of the world  saw him up there where yet the twilight lingered, a faint, black,  wavering line; and mistaking him for a row of geese going inland from  the ocean, went into their houses cheerily rubbing their hands and  saying that winter was coming, and that we should soon have snow. Soon  even there the twilight faded away, and when they descended at the  edge of the world it was night and the moon was shining. Ocean, the  ancient river, narrow and shallow there, flowed by and made no murmur.  Whether the Gibbelins banqueted or whether they watched by the door,  they also made no murmur. And Alderic dismounted and took his armour  off, and saying one prayer to his lady, swam with his pickaxe. He did  not part from his sword, for fear that he meet with a Gibbelin. Landed  the other side, he began to work at once, and all went well with him.  Nothing put out its head from any window, and all were lighted so that  nothing within could see him in the dark. The blows of his pickaxe  were dulled in the deep walls. All night he worked, no sound came to  molest him, and at dawn the last rock swerved and tumbled inwards, and  the river poured in after. Then Alderic took a stone, and went to the  bottom step, and hurled the stone at the door; he heard the echoes  roll into the tower, then he ran back and dived through the hole in  the wall.    He was in the emerald-cellar. There was no light in the lofty vault  above him, but, diving through twenty feet of water, he felt the floor  all rough with emeralds, and open coffers full of them. By a faint ray  of the moon he saw that the water was green with them, and, easily  filling a satchel, he rose again to the surface; and there were the  Gibbelins waist-deep in the water, with torches in their hands! And,  without saying a word, _or even smiling_, they neatly hanged him on  the outer wall--and the tale is one of those that have not a happy  ending.        HOW NUTH WOULD HAVE PRACTISED HIS ART UPON THE GNOLES      Despite the advertisements of rival firms, it is probable that every  tradesman knows that nobody in business at the present time has a  position equal to that of Mr. Nuth. To those outside the magic circle  of business, his name is scarcely known; he does not need to  advertise, he is consummate. He is superior even to modern  competition, and, whatever claims they boast, his rivals know it. His  terms are moderate, so much cash down when the goods are  delivered, so much in blackmail afterwards. He consults your  convenience. His skill may be counted upon; I have seen a shadow on a  windy night move more noisily than Nuth, for Nuth is a burglar by  trade. Men have been known to stay in country houses and to send a  dealer afterwards to bargain for a piece of tapestry that they saw  there--some article of furniture, some picture. This is bad taste: but  those whose culture is more elegant invariably send Nuth a night or  two after their visit. He has a way with tapestry; you would scarcely  notice that the edges had been cut. And often when I see some huge,  new house full of old furniture and portraits from other ages, I say  to myself, \"These mouldering chairs, these full-length ancestors and  carved mahogany are the produce of the incomparable Nuth.\"    It may be urged against my use of the word incomparable that in the  burglary business the name of Slith stands paramount and alone; and of  this I am not ignorant; but Slith is a classic, and lived long ago,  and knew nothing at all of modern competition; besides which the  surprising nature of his doom has possibly cast a glamour upon Slith  that exaggerates in our eyes his undoubted merits.    It must not be thought that I am a friend of Nuth's; on the contrary  such politics as I have are on the side of Property; and he needs no  words from me, for his position is almost unique in trade, being among  the very few that do not need to advertise.    At the time that my story begins Nuth lived in a roomy house in  Belgrave Square: in his inimitable way he had made friends with the  caretaker. The place suited Nuth, and, whenever anyone came to inspect  it before purchase, the caretaker used to praise the house in the  words that Nuth had suggested. \"If it wasn't for the drains,\" she  would say, \"it's the finest house in London,\" and when they pounced on  this remark and asked questions about the drains, she would answer  them that the drains also were good, but not so good as the house.  They did not see Nuth when they went over the rooms, but Nuth was  there.    Here in a neat black dress on one spring morning came an old woman  whose bonnet was lined with red, asking for Mr. Nuth; and with her  came her large and awkward son. Mrs. Eggins, the caretaker, glanced up  the street, and then she let them in, and left them to wait in the  drawing-room amongst furniture all mysterious with sheets. For a long  while they waited, and then there was a smell of pipe-tobacco, and  there was Nuth standing quite close to them.    \"Lord,\" said the old woman whose bonnet was lined with red, \"you did  make me start.\" And then she saw by his eyes that that was not the way  to speak to Mr. Nuth.    And at last Nuth spoke, and very nervously the old woman explained  that her son was a likely lad, and had been in business already but  wanted to better himself, and she wanted Mr. Nuth to teach him a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7498"],[0,"Five Little Peppers Grown Up (#8)"],[1,"husband, \"let's bury the past; Phronsie  has.\"    \"Phronsie!\" ejaculated Mrs. Dyce. \"Oh, that blessed child! Just hear her  now.\"    \"So on this Christmas Day,\" Phronsie was saying in clear tones, \"you are  to remember that you wouldn't have had this Tree but for the beautiful  Lady; and on every single other day, you must remember that you wouldn't  ever have had this Home; not a bit of any of it\"--here she turned and  looked around the picture-hung walls, and out of the long windows to the  dark pines and firs of the broad lawn, tossing their snow-laden  branches, \"but for the beautiful lady. And you must every one of you  help to make this Home just the very best Home that ever was. Will you?\"  And then she smiled down into their faces while she waited for her  answer.    \"Oh, yes, yes,\" screamed the children, every one. The little black  creature got off from her cricket at Phronsie's feet to look into her  face. \"And I will too,\" she cried.    \"And now you all want to thank Miss Phronsie for her kind words, we  know,\" Jasper cried at this point, hurrying into the middle of the  aisle, \"and so, children, you may all stand up and say 'Thank you,' and  wave your handkerchiefs.\"    Up flew all the rows of children to their feet, and a cloud of tiny  white squares of cambric fluttered in the air, and the children kept  piping out, \"Thank you--Thank you.\" And old Mr. King began a cheer for  Phronsie, and another for the children; and then somebody down at the  end of the long hall set up another for Mr. King, and somebody else  started one for Mr. Henderson, and another for Mrs. Henderson, and there  was plenty of noise, and high above it all rang the peals of happy,  childish laughter. And when it was all done, everybody pausing to take  breath, then Amy Loughead sent out the finest march ever heard, from the  grand piano, and Polly and Jasper and all the rest marshaled the  children into a procession, and Phronsie clinging to old Mr. King's hand  on the one side, and holding fast to the small black palm on the other,  away they all went, the visitors falling into line, around and around  the big hall, till at last--oh! at last, they turned into the Enchanted  Land that held the wonderful Christmas Tree. And when they were all  before it, and Phronsie in the center, she lifted her hand, and the room  became so still one could hear a pin drop. And then the little children  who had sung the carols in the morning stepped forward and began, \"It  came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old\"--    And Phronsie drew a long breath, and folded her hands, not stirring till  the very last word died on the air.    And then Jasper and the others slowly drew aside the white curtain; and  oh! the dazzling, beautiful apparition that greeted every one's eyes! No  one could stop the children's noisy delight, and the best of it was,  that no one wanted to. So for the next few moments it was exactly like  the merry time over the Tree in the \"Provision Room\" of the Little Brown  House years ago, just as Polly had said; only there was ever so much  more of it, because there were ever so many more children to make it!    And Polly and Ben were like children again themselves; and David and  Joel were everywhere helping on the fun; in which excitement the other  Harvard man and even Livingston Bayley were not ashamed to take a most  active part, as Jasper, who had borrowed Santa Claus' attire for this  occasion, now made his appearance with a most astonishing bow. And then  the presents began to fly from the Tree, and Jack Loughead seemed to be  all arms, for he was so tall he could reach down the hanging gifts from  the higher branches, so that he was in great demand; and Pickering  Dodge, one eye on all of Polly's movements, worked furiously, and Alexia  Rhys and Cathie Harrison didn't give themselves hardly time to breathe;  and there was quite enough for Mr. Alstyne and the Cabots and Hamilton  Dyce to do, and everybody else, for that matter, to pass around the  presents. And in the midst of it all, a big doll, resplendent in a red  satin gown, and an astonishing hat, was untied from the tree.    \"O, I want to give it to her myself!\" cried Phronsie.    \"So you shall,\" declared Jasper, handing it to her.    \"Susan, this is your very own child,\" said Phronsie, turning to the  little colored girl at her side. \"Now you won't feel lonely ever, will  you?\" and she laid the doll carefully into the outstretched arms.    And at last the green branches had shaken off their wealth of gifts, and  the shining candles began to go out, one by one.    \"Grandpapa,\" cried Polly, coming up to old Mr. King and Phronsie, with a  basket of mottoes and bonbons enough to satisfy the demands of the most  exacting Children's Home, \"we ought to get our paper caps on.\"    \"Bless me!\" ejaculated old Mr. King, pulling out his watch, \"it can't be  time to march. Ah, it's a quarter of four this minute. Here, child,\" to  Phronsie, \"pick out your bonbon so that I can snap it with you.\"    Phronsie gravely regarded the pretty bonbons in Polly's basket. \"I must  pick out yours first, Grandpapa,\" she said slowly, lifting a silver  paper-and-lace arrangement with a bunch of forget-me-nots in the center.  \"I think this is pretty.\"    \"So it is; most beautiful, dear,\" said the old gentleman, in great  satisfaction. \"Now we must crack it, I suppose.\" So he took hold of one  end, and Phronsie held fast to the other of the bonbon, and a sharp  little report gave the signal for all the bonbons to be opened.  Thereupon, everybody, old and young, hurried to secure one, and great  was the snapping and cracking that now followed.    \"Oh, Grandpapa, isn't your cap pretty?\" exclaimed Phronsie in pleased  surprise, drawing forth a pink and yellow crinkled tissue bit. \"See,\"  smoothing it out with a gentle hand, \"it's a crown, Grandpapa!\"    \"Now that's perfectly lovely!\" cried Polly, setting down her basket.  \"Here, let me help you, child--there, that's straight. Now, Grandpapa,  please bend over so that Phronsie can put it on.\"    Instead, the old gentleman dropped to one knee. \"Now, dear,\" he said  gallantly. So Phronsie set the pink and yellow crown on his white hair,  stepping back gravely to view the effect.    \"It is so very nice, dear Grandpapa,\" she said, coming back to his side.  So old Mr. King stood up, with quite a regal air, and Phronsie had a  little blue and white paper bonnet tied under her chin by Grandpapa's  own hand. And caps were flying on to all the heads, and each right hand  held a tinkling little bell that had swung right merrily on a green  branch-tip. And away to Amy Loughead's second march--on and on, jangling  their bells, the procession went, through the long hall, till old Mr.  King and Phronsie who led, turned down the broad staircase, and into the  dining-room; and here the guests stood on either side of the doorway  while the little Home children passed up through their midst.    And there were two long tables, one for the Home children, with a place  for Phronsie at its head, and another for old Mr. King at the foot. And  the other table was for the older people; both gay with Christmas holly,  and sweet with flowers. And when all were seated, and a hush fell upon  the big room, Phronsie lifted her hand.      _We Thank Thee, oh Lord,    For this Christmas Day,    And may we love Thee    And serve Thee alway.    For Jesus Christ    The Holy Child's sake.        Amen._    It rang out clear and sweet in childish treble, floating off into the  halls and big rooms.    \"Now, Candace,\" Phronsie lifted a plate of biscuits, and a comfortable  figure of a colored woman, resplendent in the gayest of turbans and a  smart stuff gown, made its appearance by Phronsie's chair.    \"I'm here, honey,\" and Candace's broad palm received the first plate to  be passed, which opened the ceremony of the Christmas feast.    Oh, this Christmas feast at Dunraven! It surpassed all the other  Dunraven Christmases on record; everybody said so. And at last, when no  one could possibly eat more, all the merry roomful, young and old, must  have a holly sprig fastened to the coat, or gown, or apron, and the  procession was formed to march back to the hall; and Mr. Jack Loughead's  stereopticon flashed out the most beautiful pictures, that his bright  descriptions explained to the delighted children; and then games and  romps, and more bonbons, and favors and flowers; and at last the sleighs  and barges for Mr. King's party were drawn up in the moonlight, at the  door of Dunraven, and the Christmas at the Home was only a beautiful  memory.    \"Miss Mary\"--Mr. Livingston Bayley put out his brown driving  glove--\"this way,\" trying to lead her off from the gay group on the  snow-covered veranda.    \"Why, I don't understand,\" began Polly, in the midst of trying to make  Phronsie see that it was not necessary to go back and comfort Susan with  another good-by, and turning a bewildered face up at him.    \"Why, I certainly supposed you accepted my offer to drive you to the  station,\" said Mr. Bayley hurriedly, and still extending his hand.  \"Come, Miss Pepper.\"    \"Come, Polly, I've a seat for you,\" cried Alexia, just flying into the  biggest barge. \"Do hurry, Polly.\"    \"Polly,\" called Jasper. She could see that he stood by one of the  sleighs, beckoning to her.    Meantime, Phronsie had been borne off by old Mr. King, and Polly could  hear her say, \"Somebody get Polly a seat, please.\"    \"I considered it a promise,\" Livingston Bayley was saying under cover of  the gay confusion. \"And accordingly I prepared myself. But of course if  you do not wish to fulfill it, Miss Pepper, why, I\"--    \"Oh, no, no,\" cried Polly hastily, \"if you really thought I promised  you, Mr. Bayley, I will go, thank you,\" and without a backward glance at  the others, she moved off to the gay little cutter where the horse stood  shaking his bells impatiently.    \"Where's Polly?\" somebody called"]]]
