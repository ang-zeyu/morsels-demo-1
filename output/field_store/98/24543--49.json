After his celebrated Boston engagement, women of all ages and  degrees pressed in crowds before the Tremont House to see him depart.  Their motives were various, but whether curiosity or worse, exhibiting  plainly the deep influence which Booth had upon the sex. He could be  anywhere easy and gentlemanly, and it is a matter of wonder that with  the entry which he had to many well-stocked homes, he did not make  hospitality mourn and friendship find in his visit shame and ruin. I  have not space to go into the millionth catalogue of Booth's intrigues,  even if this journal permitted further elucidation of so banned a  subject. Most of his adherents of this class were, like Heine's Polish  virgins, and he was very popular with those dramatic ladies--few, I hope  and know, in their profession--to whom divorce courts are superfluous.  His last permanent acquaintance was one Ella Turner, of Richmond, who  loved him with all the impetuosity of that love which does not think,  and strove to die at the tidings of his crime and fight. Happy that even  such a woman did not die associated with John Wilkes Booth. Such  devotion to any other murderer would have earned some poet's tear. But  the daisies will not grow a whole rod from _his_ grave.    Of what avail, may we ask, on the impossible supposition that Booth's  crime could have been considered heroic, was it that such a record  should have dared to die for fame? Victory would have been ashamed of  its champion, as England of Nelson, and France of Mirabeau.    I may add to this record that he had not been in Philadelphia a year, on  first setting out in life, before getting into a transaction of the kind  specified. For an affair at his boarding-house he was compelled to pay a  considerable sum of money, and it happily occurred just as he was to  quit the city. He had many quarrels and narrow escapes through his  license, a husband in Syracuse, N. Y., once followed him all the way to  Cleveland to avenge a domestic insult.    Booth's paper \"To Whom it may Concern\" was not his only attempt at  influential composition. He sometimes persuaded himself that he had  literary ability; but his orthography and pronunciation were worse than  his syntax. The paper deposited with J. S. Clarke was useful as showing  his power to entertain a deliberate purpose. It has one or two smart  passages in it--as this:    \"Our once bright red stripes look like _bloody gashes_ on the face of  heaven.\"    In the passages following there is common sense and lunacy:    \"I know how foolish I shall be deemed for undertaking such a step as  this, where, on the one side, I have many friends and everything to make  me happy, where my profession _alone_, has gained me an income of _more  than_ twenty thousand dollars a year, and where my _great personal  ambition_ in my profession has such a great field for labor. On the  other hand, the South have never bestowed upon me one kind word; a place  now where I have no friends, except beneath the sod; a place where I  must either become a private soldier or a beggar. To give up all of the  _former_ for the _latter_, besides my mother and sisters, whom I love so  dearly (although they so widely differ with me in opinion) seems insane;  but God is my judge.\"    Now, read the beginning of the manifesto, and see how prophetic were his  words of his coming infamy. If he expected so much for capturing the  President merely, what of our execration at slaying him?    \"Right or wrong, God judge me, not man. For be my motive good or bad, of  one thing I am sure, _the lasting condemnation_ of the North.    \"I love peace more than life. Have loved the Union beyond expression.  For four years have I waited, hoped and prayed for the dark clouds to  break, and for a restoration of our former sunshine. _To wait longer  would be a crime_. All hope for peace is dead. My prayers have proved as  idle as my hopes. God's will be done. _I go to see and share the bitter  end_.\"    To wait longer would be a crime. Oh! what was the crime _not_ to wait!  Had he only shared the bitter end, then, in the common trench, his  memory might have been hidden. The end had come when he appeared to make  of benignant victory a quenchless revenge. One more selection from his  apostrophe will do. It suggests the manner of his death:    \"They say that the South has found _that_ 'last ditch' which the North  have so long derided. Should I reach her in safety, and find it true, I  will proudly beg permission to triumph or die in that same 'ditch' by  her side.\" The swamp near which he died may be called, without unseemly  pun--a truth, not a _bon mot_--the last ditch of the rebellion.    None of the printed pictures that I have seen do justice to Booth. Some  of the _cartes de visite_ get him very nearly. He had one of the finest  vital heads I have ever seen. In fact, he was one of the best exponents  of vital beauty I have ever met. By this I refer to physical beauty in  the Medician sense--health, shapeliness, power in beautiful poise, and  seemingly more powerful in repose than in energy. His hands and feet  were sizable, not small, and his legs were stout and muscular, but  inclined to bow like his father's. From the waist up he was a perfect  man; his chest being full and broad, his shoulders gently sloping, and  his arms as white as alabaster, but hard as marble. Over these, upon a  neck which was its proper column, rose the cornice of a fine Doric face,  spare at the jaws and not anywhere over-ripe, but seamed with a nose of  Roman model, the only relic of his half-Jewish parentage, which gave  decision to the thoughtfully stern sweep of two direct, dark eyes,  meaning to woman snare, and to man a search warrant, while the lofty  square forehead and square brows were crowned with a weight of curling  jetty hair, like a rich Corinthian capital. His profile was eagleish,  and afar his countenance was haughty. He seemed throat full of  introspections, ambitious self-examinings, eye-strides into the future,  as if it withheld him something to which he had a right. I have since  wondered whether this moody demeanor did not come of a guilty spirit,  but all the Booths look so.    Wilkes spoke to me in Washington for the first time three weeks before  the murder. His address was winning as a girl's, rising in effect not  from what he said, but from how he said it. It was magnetic, and I can  describe it therefore by its effects alone. I seemed, when he had  spoken, to lean toward this man. His attitude spoke to me; with as easy  familiarity as I ever observed he drew rear and conversed. The talk was  on so trite things that it did not lie a second in the head, but when I  left him it was with the feeling that a most agreeable fellow had passed  by.    The next time the name of Wilkes Booth recurred to me was like the  pistol shot he had fired. The right hand I had shaken murdered the  father of the country.    Booth was not graceful with his feet, although his ordinary walk was  pleasant enough. But his arms were put to artistic uses; not the baser  ones like boxing, but all sorts of fencing, manual practice, and the  handling of weapons.    In his dress, he was neat without being particular. Almost any clothes  could fit him; but he had nothing of the exquisite about him; his  neckties and all such matters were good without being gaudy. Nature had  done much for him. In this beautiful palace an outlaw had builded his  fire, and slept, and plotted, and dreamed.    I have heard it said that Booth frequently cut his adversaries upon the  stage in sheer wantonness or bloodthirstiness. This is a mistake, and is  attributable to his father, the elder Booth, who had the madness of  confounding himself with the character. Wilkes was too good a fencer to  make ugly gashes; his pride was his skill, not his awkwardness. Once    he was playing with John McCullough in the last act of \"Richard.\" They  were fighting desperately. Suddenly the cross-piece on the hilt of  McCullough's sword flew off and cut the owner deeply in the forehead.  Blood ran down McCullough's face, though they continued to struggle, and  while, ostensibly, Booth was imitating a demon, he said in a half  whisper:    \"Good God, John, did I hurt you?\"    And when they went off the stage, Booth was white with fear that he had  gashed his friend.    As an actor, Booth was too energetic to be correct; his conception of  Richard was vivid and original, one of the best that we have had, and he  came nearer his father's rendering of the last act than any body we have  had. His combat scene was terrific. The statement that his voice had  failed has no valid foundation; it was as good when he challenged the  cavalry-men to combat as in the best of his Thespian successes. In all  acting that required delicate characterization, refined conception or  carefulness, Booth was at sea. But in strong physical parts, requiring  fair reading and an abundance of spring and tension, he was much finer  than hearsay would have us believe.    His _Romeo_ was described a short time ago by the Washington  _Intelligencer_ as the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine  character. He played the _Corsican Brothers_ three weeks on a run in  Boston. He played _Pescara_ at Ford's Theater--his last mock part in  this world--on to-morrow (Saturday) night, six weeks ago.    He was fond of learning and reciting fugitive poems. His favorite piece  was \"The Beautiful Snow\" comparing it to a lost purity. He has been  known by gentlemen in this city to recite this poem with fine effect,  and cry all the while. This was on the principle of \"guilty people  sitting at a play.\" His pocket-book was generally full of little  selections picked up at random, and he had considerable delicacy of  appreciation.    On the morning of the murder, Booth breakfasted with Miss Carrie Bean,  the daughter of a merchant, and a very respectable young lady,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#8)"],[1,"to an understanding of the general law governing the  movements of the whole body of stars constituting the visible  universe. Taking about eleven hundred stars whose proper motions have  been ascertained with an approach to certainty, and which are  distributed in all parts of the sky, it has been shown that there  exists an apparent double drift, in two independent streams, moving in  different and nearly opposed directions. The apex of the motion of  what is called ``Stream I'' is situated, according to Professor  Kapteyn, in right ascension 85 deg., declination south 11 deg., which places  it just south of the constellation Orion; while the apex of ``Stream  II'' is in right ascension 260 deg., declination south 48 deg., placing it in  the constellation Ara, south of Scorpio. The two apices differ very  nearly 180 deg. in right ascension and about 120 deg. in declination. The  discovery of these vast star-streams, if they really exist, is one of  the most extraordinary in modern astronomy. It offers the correlation  of stellar movements needed as the basis of a theory of those  movements, but it seems far from revealing a physical cause for them.  As projected against the celestial sphere the stars forming the two  opposite streams appear intermingled, some obeying one tendency and  some the other. As Professor Dyson has said, the hypothesis of this  double movement is of a revolutionary character, and calls for further  investigation. Indeed, it seems at first glance not less surprising  than would be the observation that in a snow-storm the flakes over our  heads were divided into two parties and driving across each other's  course in nearly opposite directions, as if urged by interpenetrating  winds.    But whatever explanation may eventually be found for the motions of  the stars, the knowledge of the existence of those motions must always  afford a new charm to the contemplative observer of the heavens, for  they impart a sense of life to the starry system that would otherwise  be lacking. A stagnant universe, with every star fixed immovably in  its place, would not content the imagination or satisfy our longing  for ceaseless activity. The majestic grandeur of the evolutions of the  celestial hosts, the inconceivable vastness of the fields of space in  which they are executed, the countless numbers, the immeasurable  distances, the involved convolutions, the flocking and the scattering,  the interpenetrating marches and countermarches, the strange community  of impulsion affecting stars that are wide apart in space and causing  them to traverse the general movement about them like aides and  despatch-bearers on a battle-field -- all these arouse an intensity of  interest which is heightened by the mystery behind them.    The Passing of the Constellations    From a historical and picturesque point of view, one of the most  striking results of the motions of the stars described in the last  chapter is their effect upon the forms of the constellations, which  have been watched and admired by mankind from a period so early that  the date of their invention is now unknown. The constellations are  formed by chance combinations of conspicuous stars, like figures in a  kaleidoscope, and if our lives were commensurate with the aeons of  cosmic existence we should perceive that the kaleidoscope of the  heavens was ceaselessly turning and throwing the stars into new  symmetries. Even if the stars stood fast, the motion of the solar  system would gradually alter the configurations, as the elements of a  landscape dissolve and recombine in fresh groupings with the  traveler's progress amid them. But with the stars themselves all in  motion at various speeds and in many directions, the changes occur  more rapidly. Of course, ``rapid'' is here understood in a relative  sense; the wheel of human history to an eye accustomed to the majestic  progression of the universe would appear to revolve with the velocity  of a whirling dynamo. Only the deliberation of geological movements  can be contrasted with the evolution and devolution of the  constellations.    And yet this secular fluctuation of the constellation figures is not  without keen interest for the meditative observer. It is another  reminder of the swift mutability of terrestial affairs. To the passing  glance, which is all that we can bestow upon these figures, they  appear so immutable that they have been called into service to form  the most lasting records of ancient thought and imagination that we  possess. In the forms of the constellations, the most beautiful, and,  in imaginative quality, the finest, mythology that the world has ever  known has been perpetuated. Yet, in a broad sense, this scroll of  human thought imprinted on the heavens is as evanescent as the summer  clouds. Although more enduring than parchment, tombs, pyramids, and  temples, it is as far as they from truly eternizing the memory of what  man has fancied and done.    Before studying the effects that the motions of the stars have had and  will have upon the constellations, it is worth while to consider a  little further the importance of the stellar pictures as archives of  history. To emphasize the importance of these effects it is only  necessary to recall that the constellations register the oldest  traditions of our race. In the history of primeval religions they are  the most valuable of documents. Leaving out of account for the moment  the more familiar mythology of the Greeks, based on something older  yet, we may refer for illustration to that of the mysterious Maya race  of America. At Izamal, in Yucatan, says Mr Stansbury Hagar, is a group  of ruins perched, after the Mexican and Central-American plan, on the  summits of pyramidal mounds which mark the site of an ancient  theogonic center of the Mayas. Here the temples all evidently refer to  a cult based upon the constellations as symbols. The figures and the  names, of course, were not the same as those that we have derived from  our Aryan ancestors, but the star groups were the same or nearly so.  For instance, the loftiest of the temples at Izamal was connected with  the sign of the constellation known to us as Cancer, marking the place  of the sun at the summer solstice, at which period the sun was  supposed to descend at noon like a great bird of fire and consume the  offerings left upon the altar. Our Scorpio was known to the Mayas as a  sign of the ``Death God.'' Our Libra, the ``Balance,'' with which the  idea of a divine weighing out of justice has always been connected,  seems to be identical with the Mayan constellation Teoyaotlatohua,  with which was associated a temple where dwelt the priests whose  special business it was to administer justice and to foretell the  future by means of information obtained from the spirits of the dead.  Orion, the ``Hunter'' of our celestial mythology, was among the Mayas  a ``Warrior,'' while Sagittarius and others of our constellations were  known to them (under different names, of course), and all were endowed  with a religious symbolism. And the same star figures, having the same  significance, were familiar to the Peruvians, as shown by the temples  at Cuzco. Thus the imagination of ancient America sought in the  constellations symbols of the unchanging gods.    But, in fact, there is no nation and no people that has not recognized  the constellations, and at one period or another in its history  employed them in some symbolic or representative capacity. As handled  by the Greeks from prehistoric times, the constellation myths became  the very soul of poetry. The imagination of that wonderful race  idealized the principal star groups so effectively that the figures  and traditions thus attached to them have, for civilized mankind,  displaced all others, just as Greek art in its highest forms stands  without parallel and eclipses every rival. The Romans translated no  heroes and heroines of the mythical period of their history to the  sky, and the deified Caesars never entered that lofty company, but the  heavens are filled with the early myths of the Greeks. Herakles  nightly resumes his mighty labors in the stars; Zeus, in the form of  the white ``Bull,'' Taurus, bears the fair Europa on his back through  the celestial waves; Andromeda stretches forth her shackled arms in  the star-gemmed ether, beseeching aid; and Perseus, in a blaze of  diamond armor, revives his heroic deeds amid sparkling clouds of  stellar dust. There, too, sits Queen Cassiopeia in her dazzling chair,  while the Great King, Cepheus, towers gigantic over the pole.  Professor Young has significantly remarked that a great number of the  constellations are connected in some way or other with the Argonautic  Expedition -- that strangely fascinating legend of earliest Greek  story which has never lost its charm for mankind. In view of all this,  we may well congratulate ourselves that the constellations will  outlast our time and the time of countless generations to follow us;  and yet they are very far from being eternal. Let us now study some of  the effects of the stellar motions upon them.    We begin with the familiar figure of the ``Great Dipper.'' He who has  not drunk inspiration from its celestial bowl is not yet admitted to  the circle of Olympus. This figure is made up of seven conspicuous  stars in the constellation Ursa Major, the ``Greater Bear.'' The  handle of the ``Dipper'' corresponds to the tail of the imaginary  ``Bear,'' and the bowl lies upon his flank. In fact, the figure of a  dipper is so evident and that of a bear so unevident, that to most  persons the ``Great Dipper'' is the only part of the constellation  that is recognizable. Of the seven stars mentioned, six are of nearly  equal brightness, ranking as of the second magnitude, while the  seventh is of only the third magnitude. The difference is very  striking, since every increase of one magnitude involves an increase"]]]
