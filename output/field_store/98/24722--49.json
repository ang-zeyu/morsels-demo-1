And I really am the widow they think I am.\"    I looked quickly up at her, in pure pity and compassion for one gone so  far in sorrow and yet such a little way in life. It was a sudden  feeling, an unpremeditated look, but I might as well have spoken aloud.  Mrs. Lascelles read me unerringly, and she shook her head, sadly but  decidedly, while her eyes gazed calmly into mine.    \"_It_ was not a happy marriage, either,\" she said, as impersonally as if  speaking of another woman. \"You may think what you like of me for saying  so to a comparative stranger; but I won't have your sympathy on false  pretences, simply because Major Lascelles is dead. Did you ever meet  him, by the way?\"    And she mentioned an Indian regiment. But the major and I had never met.    \"Well, it was not very happy for either of us. I suppose such marriages  never are. I know they are never supposed to be. Even if the couple are  everything to each other, there is all the world to point his finger,  and all the world's wife to turn her back, and you have to care a good  deal to get over that. But you may have been desperate in the first  instance; you may have said to yourself that the fire couldn't be much  worse than the frying-pan. In that case, of course, you deserve no  sympathy, and nothing is more irritating to me than the sympathy I don't  deserve. It's a matter of temperament; I'm obliged to speak out, even if  it puts people more against me than they were already. No, you needn't  say anything, Captain Clephane; you didn't express your sympathy, I  stopped you in time.... And yet it is rather hard, when one's still  reasonably young, with almost everything before one--to be a marked  woman all one's time!\"    Up to her last words, despite an inviting pause after almost every  sentence, I had succeeded in holding my tongue; though she was looking  wistfully now at the distant snow-peaks and obviously bestowing upon  herself the sympathy she did not want from me (as I had been told in so  many words, if not more plainly in the accompanying brief encounter  between our eyes), yet had I resisted every temptation to put in my  word, until these last two or three from Mrs. Lascelles. They, however,  demanded a denial, and I told her it was absurd to describe herself in  such terms.    \"I am marked,\" she persisted, \"wherever I go I may be known, as you knew  me here. If it hadn't been you it would have been somebody else, and I  should have known of it indirectly instead of directly; but even  supposing I had escaped altogether at this hotel, the next one would  probably have made up for it.\"    \"Do you stay much in hotels?\"    There had been something in the mellow voice which made such a question  only natural, yet it was scarcely asked before I would have given a good  deal to recall it.    \"There is nowhere else to stay,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"unless one sets  up house alone, which is costlier and far less comfortable. You see, one  does make a friend or two sometimes--before one is found out.\"    \"But surely your people--\"    This time I did check myself.    \"My people,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"have washed their hands of me.\"    \"But Major Lascelles--surely _his_ people--\"    \"They washed their hands of him! You see, they would be the first to  tell you, he had always been rather wild; but his crowning act of  madness in their eyes was his marriage. It was worse than the worst  thing he had ever done before. Still, it is not for me to say anything,  or feel anything, against his family....\"    And then I knew that they were making her an allowance; it was more than  I wanted to know; the ground was too delicate, and led nowhere in  particular. Still, it was difficult not to take a certain amount of  interest in a handsome woman who had made such a wreck of her life so  young, who was so utterly alone, so proud and independent in her  loneliness, and apparently quite fine-hearted and unspoilt. But for Bob  Evers and his mother, the interest that I took might have been a little  different in kind; but even with my solicitude for them there mingled  already no small consideration for the social solitary whom I watched  now as she sat peering across the glacier, the foremost figure in a  world of high lights and great backgrounds, and whom to watch was to  admire, even against the greatest of them all. Alas! mere admiration  could not change my task or stay my hand; it could but clog me by  destroying my singleness of purpose, and giving me a double heart to  match my double face.    Since, however, a detestable duty had been undertaken, and since as a  duty it was more apparent than I had dreamt of finding it, there was  nothing for it but to go through with the thing and make immediate  enemies of my friends. So I set my teeth and talked of Bob. I was glad  Mrs. Lascelles liked him. His father was a remote connection of mine,  whom I had never met. But I had once known his mother very well.    \"And what is she like?\" asked Mrs. Lascelles, calling her fine eyes home  from infinity, and fixing them once more on me.          CHAPTER VI    OUT OF ACTION      Now if, upon a warm, soft, summer evening, you were suddenly asked to  describe the perfect winter's day, either you would have to stop and  think a little, or your imagination is more elastic than mine. Yet you  might have a passionate preference for cold sun and bracing airs. To me,  Catherine Evers and this Mrs. Lascelles were as opposite to each other  as winter and summer, or the poles, or any other notorious antitheses.  There was no comparison between them in my mind, yet as I sat with one  among the sunlit, unfamiliar Alps, it was a distinct effort to picture  the other in the little London room I knew so well. For it was always  among her books and pictures that I thought of Catherine, and to think  was to wish myself there at her side, rather than to wish her here at  mine. Catherine's appeal, I used to think, was to the highest and the  best in me, to brain and soul, and young ambition, and withal to one's  love of wit and sense of humour. Mrs. Lascelles, on the other hand,  struck me primarily in the light of some splendid and spirited animal. I  still liked to dwell upon her dancing. She satisfied the mere eye more  and more. But I had no reason to suppose that she knew right from wrong  in art or literature, any more than she would seem to have distinguished  between them in life itself. Her Tauchnitz novel lay beside her on the  grass and I again reflected that it would not have found a place on  Catherine's loftiest shelf. Catherine would have raved about the view  and made delicious fun of Quinby and the judge, and we should have sat  together talking poetry and harmless scandal by the happy hour. Mrs.  Lascelles probably took place and people alike for granted. But she had  lived, and as an animal she was superb! I looked again into her healthy  face and speaking eyes, with their bitter knowledge of good and evil,  their scorn of scorn, their redeeming honesty and candour. The contrast  was complete in every detail except the widowhood of both women; but I  did not pursue it any farther; for once more there was but one woman in  my thoughts, and she sat near me under a red parasol--clashing so  humanly with the everlasting snows!    \"You don't answer my question, Captain Clephane. How much for your  thoughts?\"    \"I'll make you a present of them, Mrs. Lascelles. I was beginning to  think that a lot of rot has been written about the eternal snows and the  mountain-tops and all the rest of it. There a few lines in that last  little volume of Browning--\"    I stopped of my own accord, for upon reflection the lines would have  made a rather embarrassing quotation. But meanwhile Mrs. Lascelles had  taken alarm on other grounds.    \"Oh, _don't_ quote Browning!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"He is far too deep for me; besides, I don't care for poetry, and I was  asking you about Mrs. Evers.\"    \"Well,\" I said, with some little severity, \"she's a very clever woman.\"    \"Clever enough to understand Browning?\"    \"Quite.\"    If this was irony, it was also self-restraint, for it was to Catherine's  enthusiasm that I owed my own. The debt was one of such magnitude as a  life of devotion could scarcely have repaid, for to whom do we owe so  much as to those who first lifted the scales from our eyes and awakened  within us a soul for all such things? Catherine had been to me what I  instantly desired to become to this benighted beauty; but the desire was  not worth entertaining, since I hardly expected to be many minutes  longer on speaking terms with Mrs. Lascelles. I recalled the fact that  it was I who had broached the subject of Bob Evers and his mother,  together with my unpalatable motive for so doing. And I was seeking in  my mind, against the grain, I must confess, for a short cut back to Bob,  when Mrs. Lascelles suddenly led the way.    \"I don't think,\" said she, \"that Mr. Evers takes after his mother.\"    \"I'm afraid he doesn't,\" I replied, \"in that respect.\"    \"And I am glad,\" she said. \"I do like a boy to be a boy. The only son  of his mother is always in danger of becoming something else. Tell me,  Captain Clephane, are they very devoted to each other?\"    There was some new note in that expressive voice of hers. Was it merely  wistful, was it really jealous, or was either element the product of my  own imagination? I made answer while I wondered:    \"Absolutely devoted, I should say; but it's years since I saw them  together. Bob was a small boy then, and one of the jolliest. Still I  never expected him to grow up the charming chap he is now.\"    Mrs. Lascelles sat gazing at the great curve of Theodule Glacier. I  watched her face.    \"He _is_ charming,\" she said at length. \"I am not sure that I ever met  anybody quite like him, or rather I am quite sure that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11171"],[0,"Uncle Tom's Cabin, Young Folks' Edition (#9)"],[1,"it. To be so  near liberty, to be almost in sight of it--and then if we lost it. O  Eliza, I should die.'    'Don't fear,' said Eliza hopefully. 'The good Lord would not have  brought us so far if He didn't mean to save us. I seem to feel him with  us, George.'    So George kissed his wife and took heart again. Then the kind old lady  brought Harry in dressed as a little girl. And a very pretty girl he  made too. They called him 'Harriet,' as it was so like Harry it was easy  to remember.    Harry did not know his mamma, dressed as she was, and clung to the kind  lady, feeling rather afraid of the strange young man. That was just as  well, as he was too young to understand what this dressing-up and  pretending meant, and he might have spoiled it all by calling the  nice-looking young man 'Mamma.' So the kind lady was going with them,  pretending to be the little girl's aunt.    When everything was ready they got into a cab, and drove to the wharf.  The two young men, as they seemed to be, got out, Eliza helping the kind  lady and little girl, while George saw to the luggage.    As he was standing at the office, taking the tickets, George overheard  two men talking by his side.    'I've watched every one that came on board,' said one, 'and I know they  are not on this boat.'    'You would scarcely know the woman from a white one,' said the other.  'The man is very fair too. He has an H burned into the palm of his  hand.'    The hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a  little, but he turned calmly round, looked straight at the speaker, and  then walked slowly away to where Eliza was waiting for him.    It was a terribly anxious time, but at last the bell rang, the boat  began to move, and George and Eliza drew long sighs of relief as they  saw the shore getting farther and farther away.    It was a lovely day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and  sparkling, in the sunlight. Hour after hour the boat steamed on.    Night came; and in the morning, clear and beautiful before them, rose  the shores of Canada.    George and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat came near the little  town, where they were going to land. His breath came thick and short; a  mist gathered before his eyes; he silently pressed the little hand that  lay trembling on his arm.    The bell rang--the boat stopped.    [Illustration]    Scarcely seeing what he did, George looked out his luggage, and gathered  his little party.    They were landed on the shore, and stood still till the boat had  started again.    Then with tears of joy, the husband and wife, with their wondering  little boy in their arms, knelt down and lifted up their hearts to God.  They were free.          CHAPTER XIX      UNCLE TOM FINDS FREEDOM      The letter which Miss Ophelia wrote to Mrs. Shelby, telling her that Tom  was to be sold again, was delayed a long time in the post. When at last  it did arrive, Mr. Shelby was very ill, and though Mrs. Shelby felt  dreadfully sorry about Uncle Tom, she could do nothing, as her husband  was so ill. Soon Mr. Shelby died. Mrs. Shelby was very sad, but in her  sorrow she did not forget her promise to Aunt Chloe and Uncle Tom. As  soon as she could, she sold some land, and George Shelby, taking the  money with him, went off to try to find Uncle Tom and buy him back  again.    But by the time George Shelby, came to the place where Mr. St. Clare  used to live, Uncle Tom had been sold to Legree, and no one knew where  he had gone.    At last, after searching about for months, George Shelby found out where  Uncle Tom was, and followed him.    Two days after Legree had been so cruel, George Shelby drove up the  avenue and stopped at the door of the old house.    'I hear,' he said to Legree, 'that you bought a slave named Tom. He used  to belong to my father. I have come to buy him back again.'    Legree's face grew black with anger. 'Yes, I did buy such a fellow,' he  growled in rage. 'And a bad bargain it was, too! The most rebellious,  saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away. He owned to it, and,  when I bid him tell me where they were, he said he knew, but wouldn't  tell. He stuck to it, too, though I gave him the very worst beating I  ever gave a nigger yet. I believe he is trying to die. I shouldn't  wonder if he did.'    'Where is he?' said George. 'Let me see him.' His cheeks were crimson,  and his eye flashed fire at the thought that Legree had dared to treat  dear Uncle Tom so badly.    'He is in that shed,' said a little fellow who was holding George  Shelby's horse.    George, without saying another word, hurried to the place to which the  little boy pointed.    As he entered the shed, his head felt giddy and his heart sick.    Uncle Tom lay on a heap of straw on the floor, still and quiet.    'Oh, dear Uncle Tom,' cried George as he knelt beside him, 'dear Uncle  Tom, do wake--do speak once more. Here's Mas'r George--your own little  Mas'r George. Don't you know me?'    'Mas'r George!' said Tom, opening his eyes, and speaking in a feeble  voice. 'Mas'r George? it is--it is. It's all I wanted. They haven't  forgot me. It warms my soul; it does my old heart good. Now I shall die  content.'    'You shan't die! you mustn't die, nor think of it. I've come to buy you  and take you home,' said George, and the tears came into his eyes as he  bent over poor Uncle Tom.    'Oh, Mas'r George, ye're too late. The Lord has bought me, and is going  to take me home.'    [Illustration]    'Oh, don't. It breaks my heart to think of what you've suffered--lying  in this old shed, too.'    'You mustn't, now, tell Chloe, poor soul, how ye found me,' said Tom,  taking George by the hand. 'It would seem so dreadful to her. Only tell  her ye found me going into glory, and that I couldn't stay for no one.  And oh, the poor chil'en, and the baby--my old heart's been most broke  for them. Tell them to follow me. Give my love to mas'r, and dear, good  missis, and everybody in the place. I love them all.'    He closed his eyes, and with a smile he fell asleep. Uncle Tom too was  free.    Beyond the gates of Legree's farm, George had noticed a dry, sandy  knoll, shaded by a few trees. There he made Uncle Tom's grave. No stone  marks his last resting-place. He needs none. God knows where he lies.    Kneeling there George bent his head, in shame and sorrow. 'Here me, dear  God,' he said, 'from this day, I will do what one man can to drive out  the curse of slavery from this land.'          CHAPTER XX      GEORGE SHELBY FREES HIS SLAVES      George Shelby wrote a little note to his mother, telling her that he was  coming home. He tried to write about Uncle Tom, but he could not; tears  blinded him, and sobs choked him.    On the day he was expected every one was in a state of bustle and  excitement. Aunt Chloe in a new print dress, and clean white apron  walked round the supper-table, making sure that everything was right.  Her black face shone with joy at the thought of seeing Uncle Tom again.    'I'm thinking my old man won't know the boys and the baby,' she said.    Mrs. Shelby sighed. Ever since the letter had come from George she had  had a very sad heart. She felt sure something must be wrong.    'He won't know the baby, my old man won't,' said Chloe again, 'Why, it's  five years since they took him.'    Just then the sound of wheels was heard.    'It's Mas'r George,' cried Aunt Chloe, running to the window in great  excitement.    Mrs. Shelby ran to the door. As George met her he put his arms round  her, and kissed her tenderly.    Aunt Chloe stood behind anxiously looking out into the darkness.    'Oh, poor Aunt Chloe,' said George, gently taking her hard, black hand  between both his own. 'I'd have given all my fortune to have brought  Uncle Tom home with me; but he has gone to a better country.' Mrs.  Shelby cried out as if she had been hurt, but Aunt Chloe did not make a  sound.    In silence they went into the supper-room.    [Illustration:]    'There,' said Aunt Chloe, holding out her trembling hands to her  mistress, 'it's just as I knew it would be. He's been sold and murdered  on dem old plantations.'    Then she turned and walked proudly out of the room. Mrs. Shelby followed  her softly, took one of her hands, drew her down into a chair, and sat  down beside her.    'My poor, good Chloe,' she said gently.    Chloe leaned her head on her mistress's shoulder, and sobbed out, 'Oh,  missis, 'scuse me, my heart's broke--dat's all.'    'I know it is,' said Mrs. Shelby, as her tears fell fast, 'and I cannot  heal it.'    There was silence for a little as they wept together. Then George sat  down beside Aunt Chloe, and took her hand. He talked gently to her,  telling her of Uncle Tom's last loving messages. So she was comforted a  little.    One morning, about a month after this, George Shelby called all his  servants together, telling them he had something to say to them.    They wondered what it could be, and were very much surprised when he  appeared, carrying a bundle of papers in his hand.    They were still more astonished when he gave a paper to each one, and  told them all that they were free.    With sobs and tears and shouts they pressed round him, thanking and  blessing him. But some of them came with anxious faces, begging him to  take their free papers back again, and not to send them away.    'We don't want to be any freer than we are,' they said. 'We have always  had all we wanted.'    'We don't want to leave the old place, and young mas'r and Missis, and  the rest.'    [Illustration]    'My good friends,' said George, when he could get silence, 'there will  be no need for you to leave me. We want quite as many servants as we did  before. But now you are free men and free women. I shall pay you wages  for your work, and if I die, or get into debt, you can't be taken away  to be sold. That is all the difference. I want you all to stay with me,  for I want to teach you how to live"]]]
