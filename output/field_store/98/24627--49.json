I am  startled by a thunderclap whether I recognize it or not--more likely, if  I do not recognize it. But if I say, either out loud or to myself, that  is thunder, I respond to the disturbance as a meaning. My behavior has  a mental quality. When things have a meaning for us, we mean (intend,  propose) what we do: when they do not, we act blindly, unconsciously,  unintelligently.    In both kinds of responsive adjustment, our activities are directed or  controlled. But in the merely blind response, direction is also blind.  There may be training, but there is no education. Repeated responses to  recurrent stimuli may fix a habit of acting in a certain way. All of us  have many habits of whose import we are quite unaware, since they were  formed without our knowing what we were about. Consequently they possess  us, rather than we them. They move us; they control us. Unless we become  aware of what they accomplish, and pass judgment upon the worth of the  result, we do not control them. A child might be made to bow every time  he met a certain person by pressure on his neck muscles, and bowing  would finally become automatic. It would not, however, be an act of  recognition or deference on his part, till he did it with a certain end  in view--as having a certain meaning. And not till he knew what he was  about and performed the act for the sake of its meaning could he be said  to be \"brought up\" or educated to act in a certain way. To have an idea  of a thing is thus not just to get certain sensations from it. It is  to be able to respond to the thing in view of its place in an inclusive  scheme of action; it is to foresee the drift and probable consequence of  the action of the thing upon us and of our action upon it. To have the  same ideas about things which others have, to be like-minded with them,  and thus to be really members of a social group, is therefore to attach  the same meanings to things and to acts which others attach. Otherwise,  there is no common understanding, and no community life. But in a shared  activity, each person refers what he is doing to what the other is doing  and vice-versa. That is, the activity of each is placed in the same  inclusive situation. To pull at a rope at which others happen to be  pulling is not a shared or conjoint activity, unless the pulling is  done with knowledge that others are pulling and for the sake of either  helping or hindering what they are doing. A pin may pass in the course  of its manufacture through the hands of many persons. But each may do  his part without knowledge of what others do or without any reference  to what they do; each may operate simply for the sake of a separate  result--his own pay. There is, in this case, no common consequence to  which the several acts are referred, and hence no genuine intercourse  or association, in spite of juxtaposition, and in spite of the fact  that their respective doings contribute to a single outcome. But if each  views the consequences of his own acts as having a bearing upon what  others are doing and takes into account the consequences of their  behavior upon himself, then there is a common mind; a common intent  in behavior. There is an understanding set up between the different  contributors; and this common understanding controls the action of each.  Suppose that conditions were so arranged that one person automatically  caught a ball and then threw it to another person who caught and  automatically returned it; and that each so acted without knowing where  the ball came from or went to. Clearly, such action would be without  point or meaning. It might be physically controlled, but it would not be  socially directed. But suppose that each becomes aware of what the  other is doing, and becomes interested in the other's action and thereby  interested in what he is doing himself as connected with the action of  the other. The behavior of each would then be intelligent; and socially  intelligent and guided. Take one more example of a less imaginary kind.  An infant is hungry, and cries while food is prepared in his presence.  If he does not connect his own state with what others are doing, nor  what they are doing with his own satisfaction, he simply reacts with  increasing impatience to his own increasing discomfort. He is physically  controlled by his own organic state. But when he makes a back and forth  reference, his whole attitude changes. He takes an interest, as we say;  he takes note and watches what others are doing. He no longer reacts  just to his own hunger, but behaves in the light of what others are  doing for its prospective satisfaction. In that way, he also no  longer just gives way to hunger without knowing it, but he notes, or  recognizes, or identifies his own state. It becomes an object for him.  His attitude toward it becomes in some degree intelligent. And in such  noting of the meaning of the actions of others and of his own state, he  is socially directed.    It will be recalled that our main proposition had two sides. One of them  has now been dealt with: namely, that physical things do not influence  mind (or form ideas and beliefs) except as they are implicated in action  for prospective consequences. The other point is persons modify one  another's dispositions only through the special use they make of  physical conditions. Consider first the case of so-called expressive  movements to which others are sensitive; blushing, smiling, frowning,  clinching of fists, natural gestures of all kinds. In themselves, these  are not expressive. They are organic parts of a person's attitude. One  does not blush to show modesty or embarrassment to others, but because  the capillary circulation alters in response to stimuli. But others  use the blush, or a slightly perceptible tightening of the muscles of  a person with whom they are associated, as a sign of the state in  which that person finds himself, and as an indication of what course  to pursue. The frown signifies an imminent rebuke for which one must  prepare, or an uncertainty and hesitation which one must, if possible,  remove by saying or doing something to restore confidence. A man at some  distance is waving his arms wildly. One has only to preserve an attitude  of detached indifference, and the motions of the other person will be on  the level of any remote physical change which we happen to note. If we  have no concern or interest, the waving of the arms is as meaningless  to us as the gyrations of the arms of a windmill. But if interest is  aroused, we begin to participate. We refer his action to something we  are doing ourselves or that we should do. We have to judge the meaning  of his act in order to decide what to do. Is he beckoning for help? Is  he warning us of an explosion to be set off, against which we should  guard ourselves? In one case, his action means to run toward him; in the  other case, to run away. In any case, it is the change he effects in  the physical environment which is a sign to us of how we should conduct  ourselves. Our action is socially controlled because we endeavor to  refer what we are to do to the same situation in which he is acting.    Language is, as we have already seen (ante, p. 15) a case of this joint  reference of our own action and that of another to a common situation.  Hence its unrivaled significance as a means of social direction. But  language would not be this efficacious instrument were it not that  it takes place upon a background of coarser and more tangible use of  physical means to accomplish results. A child sees persons with whom he  lives using chairs, hats, tables, spades, saws, plows, horses, money in  certain ways. If he has any share at all in what they are doing, he is  led thereby to use things in the same way, or to use other things in a  way which will fit in. If a chair is drawn up to a table, it is a sign  that he is to sit in it; if a person extends his right hand, he is to  extend his; and so on in a never ending stream of detail. The prevailing  habits of using the products of human art and the raw materials of  nature constitute by all odds the deepest and most pervasive mode  of social control. When children go to school, they already have  \"minds\"--they have knowledge and dispositions of judgment which may  be appealed to through the use of language. But these \"minds\" are the  organized habits of intelligent response which they have previously  required by putting things to use in connection with the way  other persons use things. The control is inescapable; it saturates  disposition. The net outcome of the discussion is that the fundamental  means of control is not personal but intellectual. It is not \"moral\" in  the sense that a person is moved by direct personal appeal from others,  important as is this method at critical junctures. It consists in  the habits of understanding, which are set up in using objects in  correspondence with others, whether by way of cooperation and assistance  or rivalry and competition. Mind as a concrete thing is precisely  the power to understand things in terms of the use made of them; a  socialized mind is the power to understand them in terms of the use to  which they are turned in joint or shared situations. And mind in this  sense is the method of social control.    3. Imitation and Social Psychology. We have already noted the defects of  a psychology of learning which places the individual mind naked, as  it were, in contact with physical objects, and which believes that  knowledge, ideas, and beliefs accrue from their interaction. Only  comparatively recently has the predominating influence of association  with fellow beings in the formation of mental and moral disposition been  perceived. Even now it is usually treated as a kind of adjunct to an  alleged method of learning by direct contact with things, and as merely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8537"],[0,"Lonesome Land (#8)"],[1,"he were dead, or that his head would stop aching.    Val took one of her unexpected changes of mood. She went up and laid her  cold fingers lightly upon his temples, where she could see the blood  beating savagely in the swollen veins. \"What a little beast I am!\" she  murmured contritely. \"Shall I get you some coffee, dear? Or some headache  tablets, or--You know a cold cloth helped you last evening. Lie down for a  little while. There's no hurry about starting, is there? I--I don't hate  the place so awfully, Manley. I'm just cross because I couldn't sleep for  the noise. Here's a cushion, dear. I think it's stuffed with scrap iron,  for there doesn't seem to be anything soft about it except the invitation  to 'slumber sweetly,' in red and green silk; but anything is better than  the head of that sofa in its natural state.\"    She arranged the cushion to her own liking, if not to his, and when it  was done she bent down impulsively and kissed him on the cheek, blushing  vividly the while.    \"I won't be nasty and cross any more,\" she promised. \"Now, I'm going to  interview Arline. I hear dishes rattling somewhere; perhaps I can get a cup  of real coffee for you.\" At the door she shook her finger at him playfully.  \"Don't you dare stir off that sofa while I'm gone,\" she admonished. \"And,  remember, we're not going to leave town until your head stops aching--not  if we stay here a week!\"    She insisted upon bringing him coffee and toast upon a tray--a battered old  tray, purloined for that purpose from the saloon, if she had only known  it--and she informed him, with a pretty, domestic pride, that she had made  the toast herself.    \"Arline was going to lay slices of bread on top of the stove,\" she  explained. \"She said she always makes toast that way, and no one could tell  the difference! I never heard of such a thing--did you, Manley? But I've  been attending a cooking school ever since you left Fern Hill. I didn't  tell you--I wanted it for a surprise. I could have done better with the  toast before a wood fire--I think poor Arline was nearly distracted at the  way I poked coals down from the grate; but she didn't say anything. Isn't  it funny, to have cream in cans! I don't suppose it ever saw a cow--do you?  The coffee's pretty bad, isn't it? But wait until we get home! I can make  lovely coffee--if you'll get me a percolator. You will, won't you? And I  learned now to make the most delicious fruit salad, just before I left. A  cousin of Mrs. Forman's taught me how. Could you drink another cup, dear?\"    Manley could not, and she deplored the poor quality, although she  generously absolved Arline from blame, because there seemed so much to do  in that kitchen. She refused to take any breakfast herself, telling him  gayly that the odor in the kitchen was both food and drink.    Because he understood a little of her loathing for the place, Manley lied  heroically about his headache, so that within an hour they were leaving  town, with the two great trunks roped securely to the buckboard behind the  seat, and with Val's suitcase placed flat in the front, where she could  rest her feet upon it. Val was so happy at the prospect of getting away  from the town that she actually threw a kiss in the direction of Arline,  standing with her frowsy head, her dough-spotted apron, and her tired face  in the parlor door.    Her mood changed immediately, however, for she had no more than turned from  waving her hand at Arline, when they met Kent, riding slowly up the street  with his hat tilted over the eye most swollen. Without a doubt he had seen  her waving and smiling, and so he must have observed the instant cooling of  her manner. He nodded to Manley and lifted his hat while he looked at her  full; and Val, in the arrogant pride of virtuous young womanhood, let her  golden-brown eyes dwell impersonally upon his face; let her white, round  chin dip half an inch downward, and then looked past him as if he were a  post by the roadside. Afterwards she smiled maliciously when she saw, with  a swift, sidelong glance, how he scowled and spurred unnecessarily his gray  gelding.          CHAPTER V. COLD SPRING RANCH    For almost three years the letters from Manley had been headed \"Cold  Spring Ranch.\" For quite as long Val had possessed a mental picture of the  place--a picture of a gurgly little brook with rocks and watercress and  distracting little pools the size of a bathtub, and with a great, frowning  boulder--a cliff, almost--at the head. The brook bubbled out and formed  a basin in the shadow of the rock. Around it grew trees, unnamed in the  picture, it is true, but trees, nevertheless. Below the spring stood a  picturesque little cottage. A shack, Manley had written, was but a synonym  for a small cottage, and Val had many small cottages in mind, from which  she sketched one into her picture. The sun shone on it, and the western  breezes flapped white curtains in the windows, and there was a porch where  she would swing her hammock and gaze out over the great, beautiful country,  fascinating in its very immensity.    Somewhere beyond the cottage--\"shack,\" she usually corrected herself--were  the corrals; they were as yet rather impressionistic; high, round,  mysterious inclosures forming an effective, if somewhat hazy, background to  the picture. She left them to work out their attractive details upon closer  acquaintance, for at most they were merely the background. The front yard,  however, she dwelt upon, and made aglow with sturdy, bright-hued flowers.  Manley had that spring planted sweet peas, and poppies, and pansies, and  other things, he wrote her, and they had come up very nicely. Afterward,  in a postscript, he answered her oft-repeated questions about the flower  garden:    The flowers aren't doing as well as they might. They need your tender care.  I don't have much time to pet them along. The onions are doing pretty well,  but they need weeding badly.    In spite of that, the flowers bloomed luxuriantly in her mental picture,  though she conscientiously remembered that they weren't doing as well as  they might. They were weedy and unkempt, she supposed, but a little time  and care would remedy that; and was she not coming to be the mistress of  all this, and to make everything beautiful? Besides, the spring, and the  brook which ran from it, and the trees which shaded it, were the chief  attractions.    Perhaps she betrayed a lack of domesticity because she had not been able  to \"see\" the interior of the cottage--\"shack\"--very clearly. Sunny rooms,  white curtains, bright cushions and books, pictures and rugs mingled  together rather confusingly in her mind when she dwelt upon the inside of  her future home. It would be bright, and cozy, and \"homy,\" she knew. She  would love it because it would be hers and Manley's, and she could do with  it what she would. She bothered about that no more than she did about the  dresses she would be wearing next year.    Cold Spring Ranch! Think of the allurement of that name, just as it  stands, without any disconcerting qualification whatever! Any girl with  yellow-brown hair and yellow-brown eyes to match, and a dreamy temperament  that beautifies everything her imagination touches, would be sure to build  a veritable Eve's garden around those three small words.    With that picture still before her mental vision, clear as if she had all  her life been familiar with it in reality, she rode beside Manley for three  weary hours, across a wide, wide prairie which looked perfectly level when  you viewed it as a whole, but which proved all hills and hollows when  you drove over it. During those three hours they passed not one human  habitation after the first five miles were behind them. There had been a  ranch, back there against a reddish-yellow bluff. Val had gazed upon it,  and then turned her head away, distressed because human beings could  consent to live in such unattractive surroundings. It was bad in its way as  Hope, she thought, but did not say, because Manley was talking about his  cattle, and she did not want to interrupt him.    After that there had been no houses of any sort. There was a barbed-wire  fence stretching away and away until the posts were mere pencil lines  against the blue, where the fence dipped over the last hill before the sky  bent down and kissed the earth.    The length of that fence was appalling in a vague, wordless way, Val  unconsciously drew closer to her husband when she looked at it, and  shivered in spite of the midsummer heat.    \"You're getting tired.\" Manley put his arm around her and held her there.    \"We're over half-way now. A little longer and we'll be home.\" Then he  bethought him that she might want some preparation for that home-coming.  \"You mustn't expect much, little wife. It's a bachelor's house, so far.  You'll have to do some fixing before it will suit you. You don't look  forward to anything like Fern Hill, do you?\"    Val laughed, and bent solicitously over the suitcase, which her feet had  marred. \"Of course I don't. Nothing out here is like Fern Hill. I know our  ranch is different from anything I ever knew--but I know just how it will  be, and how everything will look.\"    \"Oh! Do you?\" Manley looked at her a bit anxiously.    \"For three years,\" Val reminded him, \"you have been describing things  to me. You told me what it was like when you first took the place. You  described everything, from Cold Spring Coulee to the house you built, and  the spring under the rock wall, and even the meadow lark's nest you found  in the weeds. Of _course_ I know.\"    \"It's going to seem pretty rough, at first,\" he observed rather  apologetically.    \"Yes--but I shall not mind that. I want it to be rough. I'm tired to death  of the smug smoothness of my life so far. Oh, if you only knew how I have  hated Fern Hill, these last three years, especially since I graduated. Just  the same petty little lives lived in"]]]
