After high mass, the  different dignitaries again waited on the emperor, to offer their  congratulations, and were admitted to the honour of kissing his  hand, etc.  The imperial couple then placed themselves at a window  of the palace, while the troops defiled before them, with their  bands playing the most lively airs.  It would be difficult to find  better dressed soldiers than those here:  every private might easily  be mistaken for a lieutenant, or at least a non-commissioned  officer; but unluckily, their bearing, size, and colour, are greatly  out of keeping with the splendour of their uniform--a mere boy of  fourteen standing next to a full-grown, well-made man, a white  coming after a black, and so on.    The men are pressed into the service; the time of serving is from  four to six years.      I had heard and read a great deal in Europe of the natural  magnificence and luxury of the Brazils--of the ever clear and  smiling sky, and the extraordinary charm of the continual spring;  but though it is true that the vegetation is perhaps richer, and the  fruitfulness of the soil more luxuriant and vigorous than in any  other part of the world, and that every one who desires to see the  working of nature in its greatest force and incessant activity, must  come to Brazil; still it must not be thought that all is good and  beautiful, and that there is nothing which will not weaken the  magical effect of the first impression.    Although every one begins by praising the continual verdure and the  uninterrupted splendour of spring met with in this country, he is,  in the end, but too willing to allow, that even this, in time, loses  its charm.  A little winter would be preferable, as the reawakening  of nature, the resuscitation of the slumbering plants, the return of  the sweet perfume of spring, enchants us all the more, simply  because during a short period we have been deprived of it.    I found the climate and the air exceedingly oppressive; and the  heat, although at that period hardly above 86 degrees in the shade,  very weakening.  During the warm months, which last from the end of  December to May, the heat rises in the shade to 99 degrees, and in  the sun to above 122 degrees.  In Egypt, I bore a greater amount of  heat with far greater ease; a circumstance which may perhaps be  accounted for by the fact, that the climate is there drier, while  here there is always an immense degree of moisture.  Fogs and mists  are very common; the hills and eminences, nay, even whole tracts of  country, are often enveloped in impenetrable gloom, and the whole  atmosphere loaded with damp vapours.    In the month of November I was seriously indisposed for a  considerable period.  I suffered, especially in the town, from an  oppressive feeling of fatigue and weakness; and to the kindness and  friendship of Herr Geiger, the Secretary to the Austrian Consulate,  and his wife, who took me with them into the country, and showed me  the greatest attention, do I alone owe my recovery.  I ascribed my  illness altogether to the unusual dampness of the atmosphere.    The most agreeable season is said to be the winter (from June to  October); that, with a temperature of from 63 to 72 degrees, is  mostly dry and clear.  This period is generally selected by the  inhabitants for travelling.  During the summer, violent thunder-  storms are of frequent occurrence:  I myself only saw three during  my stay in the Brazils, all of which were over in an hour and a  half.  The lightning was almost incessant, and spread like a sheet  of fire over the greater portion of the horizon; the thunder, on the  other hand, was inconsiderable.    Clear, cloudless days (from 16th September to 9th December) were so  rare, that I really could have counted them; and I am at a loss to  understand how so many travellers have spoken of the ever beautiful,  smiling, and blue sky of the Brazils.  This must be true of some  other portion of the year.    A fine evening and long twilight is another source of enjoyment  which may be said to be unknown:  at sunset every one hastens home,  as it is immediately followed by darkness and damp.    In the height of summer the sun sets at about a quarter past 6, and  all the rest of the year at 6 o'clock; twenty or thirty minutes  afterwards, night sets in.    The mosquitoes, ants, baraten, and sand-fleas are another source of  annoyance; many a night have I been obliged to sit up, tormented and  tortured by the bite of these insects.  It is hardly possible to  protect provisions from the attacks of the baraten and ants.  The  latter, in fact, often appear in long trains of immeasureable  length, pursuing their course over every obstacle which stands in  the way.  During my stay in the country at Herr Geiger's, I beheld a  swarm of this description traverse a portion of the house.  It was  really most interesting to see what a regular line they formed;  nothing could make them deviate from the direction they had first  determined on.  Madame Geiger told me that she was one night awoke  by a horrible itching; she sprang immediately out of bed, and beheld  a swarm of ants of the above description pass over her bed.  There  is no remedy for this; the end of the procession, which often lasts  four or six hours, must be waited for with patience.  Provisions are  to some extent protected from them, by placing the legs of the  tables and presses in plates filled with water.  Clothes and linen  are laid in tightly-fitting tin canisters, to protect them, not only  from the ants, but also from the baraten and the damp.    The worst plague of all, however, are the sand-fleas, which attach  themselves to one's toes, underneath the nails, or sometimes to the  soles of the feet.  The moment a person feels an itching in these  parts he must immediately look at the place; if he sees a small  black point surrounded by a small white ring, the former is the  flea, and the latter the eggs which it has laid in the flesh.  The  first thing done is to loosen the skin all round as far as the white  ring is visible; the whole deposit is then extracted, and a little  snuff strewed in the empty space.  The best plan is to call in the  first black you may happen to see, as they all perform this  operation very skilfully.    As regards the natural products of the Brazils, a great many of the  most necessary articles are wanting in the list.  It is true that  there are sugar and coffee, but no corn, no potatoes, and none of  our delicious varieties of fruit.  The flour of manioc, which is  mixed up with the other materials of which the dishes are composed,  supplies the place of bread, but is far from being so nutritious and  strengthening, while the different kinds of sweet-tasting roots are  certainly not to be compared to our potatoes.  The only fruit, which  are really excellent, are the oranges, bananas and mangoes.  Their  celebrated pine-apples are neither very fragrant nor remarkably  sweet; I certainly have eaten much finer flavoured ones that had  been grown in a European hot-house.  The other kinds of fruit are  not worth mentioning.  Lastly, with the two very necessary articles  of consumption, milk and meat, the former is very watery, and the  latter very dry.    On instituting a comparison between the Brazils and Europe, both  with respect to the impression produced by the whole, as also to the  separate advantages and disadvantages of each, we shall, perhaps, at  first find the scale incline towards the former country, but only to  turn ultimately with greater certainty in favour of the latter.    The Brazils is, perhaps, the most interesting country in the world  for travellers; but for a place of permanent residence I should most  decidedly prefer Europe.      I saw too little of the manners and customs of the country to be  qualified to pronounce judgment upon them, and I shall therefore, on  this head, confine myself to a few remarks.  The manners seem, on  the whole, to differ but little from those of Europe.  The present  possessors of the country, as is well known, derive their descent  from Portugal, and the Brazilians might very aptly be termed  \"Europeans translated into Americans;\" and it is very natural, that  in this \"translation\" many peculiarities have been lost, while  others have stood forth in greater relief.  The strongest feature in  the character of the European-American is the greed for gold; this  often becomes a passion, and transforms the most faint-hearted white  into a hero, for it certainly requires the courage of one to live  alone, as planter, on a plantation with perhaps some hundred slaves,  far removed from all assistance, and with the prospect of being  irrevocably lost in the event of any revolt.    This grasping feeling is not confined to the men alone; it is found  among the women as well, and is greatly encouraged by a common  custom here, agreeably to which, a husband never assigns his wife so  much for pin-money, but, according to his means, makes her a present  of one or more male or female slaves, whom she can dispose of as she  chooses.  She generally has them taught how to cook, sew, embroider,  or even instructed in some trade, and then lets them out, by the  day, week, or month, {27} to people who possess no slaves of their  own; or she lets them take in washing at home, or employs them in  the manufacture of various ornamental objects, fine pastry, etc,  which she sends them out to sell.  The money for these things  belongs to her, and is generally spent in dress and amusement.    In the case of tradesmen, and professional men, the wife is always  paid for whatever assistance she may lend her husband in his  business.    Morality, unfortunately, is not very general in the Brazils; one  cause of this may be traced to the manner in which the children are  first brought up.  They are confided entirely to the care of blacks."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11074"],[0,"The Damned (#9)"],[1,"of an overgrown suburban garden, inspired by the spirit of a  vulgar, rich revivalist who loved to preach damnation, she saw this rush  of pagan liberty and joy, this strange license of primitive flesh which,  tainted by the other, produced the adulterated, vile result.    Certain things, however, gradually then became apparent, forcing  themselves upon me, willy-nilly. They came slowly, but overwhelmingly.  Not that facts had changed, or natural details altered in the grounds--  this was impossible--but that I noticed for the first time various  aspects I had not noticed before--trivial enough, yet for me, just then,  significant. Some I remembered from previous days; others I saw now as I  wandered to and fro, uneasy, uncomfortable,--almost, it seemed, watched  by some one who took note of my impressions. The details were so  foolish, the total result so formidable. I was half aware that others  tried hard to make me see. It was deliberate.    My sister's phrase, \"one layer got at me, another gets at you,\" flashed,  undesired, upon me.    For I saw, as with the eyes of a child, what I can only call a goblin  garden--house, grounds, trees, and flowers belonged to a goblin world  that children enter through the pages of their fairy tales. And what  made me first aware of it was the whisper of the wind behind me, so that  I turned with a sudden start, feeling that something had moved closer.  An old ash tree, ugly and ungainly, had been artificially trained to  form an arbor at one end of the terrace that was a tennis lawn, and the  leaves of it now went rustling together, swishing as they rose and fell.  I looked at the ash tree, and felt as though I had passed that moment  between doors into this goblin garden that crouched behind the real one.  Below, at a deeper layer perhaps, lay hidden the one my sister had  entered.    To deal with my own, however, I call it goblin, because an odd aspect of  the quaint in it yet never quite achieved the picturesque. Grotesque,  probably, is the truer word, for everywhere I noticed, and for the first  time, this slight alteration of the natural due either to the  exaggeration of some detail, or to its suppression, generally, I think,  to the latter. Life everywhere appeared to me as blocked from the full  delivery of its sweet and lovely message. Some counter influence stopped  it--suppression; or sent it awry--exaggeration. The house itself, mere  expression, of course, of a narrow, limited mind, was sheer ugliness; it  required no further explanation. With the grounds and garden, so far as  shape and general plan were concerned, this was also true; but that  trees and flowers and other natural details should share the same  deficiency perplexed my logical soul, and even dismayed it. I stood and  stared, then moved about, and stood and stared again. Everywhere was  this mockery of a sinister, unfinished aspect. I sought in vain to  recover my normal point of view. My mind had found this goblin garden  and wandered to and fro in it, unable to escape.    The change was in myself, of course, and so trivial were the details  which illustrated it, that they sound absurd, thus mentioned one by one.  For me, they proved it, is all I can affirm. The goblin touch lay  plainly everywhere: in the forms of the trees, planted at neat intervals  along the lawns; in this twisted ash that rustled just behind me; in the  shadow of the gloomy wellingtonias, whose sweeping skirts obscured the  grass; but especially, I noticed, in the tops and crests of them. For  here, the delicate, graceful curves of last year's growth seemed to  shrink back into themselves. None of them pointed upwards. Their life  had failed and turned aside just when it should have become triumphant.  The character of a tree reveals itself chiefly at the extremities, and  it was precisely here that they all drooped and achieved this hint of  goblin distortion--in the growth, that is, of the last few years. What  ought to have been fairy, joyful, natural, was instead uncomely to the  verge of the grotesque. Spontaneous expression was arrested. My mind  perceived a goblin garden, and was caught in it. The place grimaced at  me.    With the flowers it was similar, though far more difficult to detect in  detail for description. I saw the smaller vegetable growth as impish,  half-malicious. Even the terraces sloped ill, as though their ends had  sagged since they had been so lavishly constructed; their varying angles  gave a queerly bewildering aspect to their sequence that was unpleasant  to the eye. One might wander among their deceptive lengths and get lost  --lost among open terraces!--with the house quite close at hand. Unhomely  seemed the entire garden, unable to give repose, restlessness in it  everywhere, almost strife, and discord certainly.    Moreover, the garden grew into the house, the house into the garden, and  in both was this idea of resistance to the natural--the spirit that says  No to joy. All over it I was aware of the effort to achieve another end,  the struggle to burst forth and escape into free, spontaneous expression  that should be happy and natural, yet the effort forever frustrated by  the weight of this dark shadow that rendered it abortive. Life crawled  aside into a channel that was a cul-de-sac, then turned horribly upon  itself. Instead of blossom and fruit, there were weeds. This approach of  life I was conscious of--then dismal failure. There was no fulfillment.  Nothing happened.    And so, through this singular mood, I came a little nearer to understand  the unpure thing that had stammered out into expression through my  sister's talent. For the unpure is merely negative; it has no existence;  it is but the cramped expression of what is true, stammering its way  brokenly over false boundaries that seek to limit and confine. Great,  full expression of anything is pure, whereas here was only the  incomplete, unfinished, and therefore ugly. There was a strife and pain  and desire to escape. I found myself shrinking from house and grounds as  one shrinks from the touch of the mentally arrested, those in whom life  has turned awry. There was almost mutilation in it.    Past items, too, now flocked to confirm this feeling that I walked,  liberty captured and half-maimed, in a monstrous garden. I remembered  days of rain that refreshed the countryside, but left these grounds,  cracked with the summer heat, unsatisfied and thirsty; and how the big  winds, that cleaned the woods and fields elsewhere, crawled here with  difficulty through the dense foliage that protected The Towers from the  North and West and East. They were ineffective, sluggish currents. There  was no real wind. Nothing happened. I began to realize--far more clearly  than in my sister's fanciful explanation about \"layers\"--that here were  many contrary influences at work, mutually destructive of one another.  House and grounds were not haunted merely; they were the arena of past  thinking and feeling, perhaps of terrible, impure beliefs, each striving  to suppress the others, yet no one of them achieving supremacy because  no one of them was strong enough, no one of them was true. Each,  moreover, tried to win me over, though only one was able to reach my  mind at all. For some obscure reason--possibly because my temperament  had a natural bias towards the grotesque--it was the goblin layer. With  me, it was the line of least resistance....    In my own thoughts this \"goblin garden\" revealed, of course, merely my  personal interpretation. I felt now objectively what long ago my mind  had felt subjectively. My work, essential sign of spontaneous life with  me, had stopped dead; production had become impossible.    I stood now considerably closer to the cause of this sterility. The  Cause, rather, turned bolder, had stepped insolently nearer. Nothing  happened anywhere; house, garden, mind alike were barren, abortive, torn  by the strife of frustrate impulse, ugly, hateful, sinful. Yet behind it  all was still the desire of life--desire to escape--accomplish. Hope--an  intolerable hope--I became startlingly aware--crowned torture.    And, realizing this, though in some part of me where Reason lost her  hold, there rose upon me then another and a darker thing that caught me  by the throat and made me shrink with a sense of revulsion that touched  actual loathing. I knew instantly whence it came, this wave of  abhorrence and disgust, for even while I saw red and felt revolt rise in  me, it seemed that I grew partially aware of the layer next below the  goblin. I perceived the existence of this deeper stratum. One opened the  way for the other, as it were. There were so many, yet all  inter-related; to admit one was to clear the way for all. If I lingered  I should be caught--horribly. They struggled with such violence for  supremacy among themselves, however, that this latest uprising was  instantly smothered and crushed back, though not before a glimpse had  been revealed to me, and the redness in my thoughts transferred itself  to color my surroundings thickly and appallingly--with blood. This lurid  aspect drenched the garden, smeared the terraces, lent to the very soil  a tinge as of sacrificial rites, that choked the breath in me, while it  seemed to fix me to the earth my feet so longed to leave. It was so  revolting that at the same time I felt a dreadful curiosity as of  fascination--I wished to stay. Between these contrary impulses I think I  actually reeled a moment, transfixed by a fascination of the Awful.  Through the lighter goblin veil I felt myself sinking down, down, down  into this turgid layer that was so much more violent and so much more  ancient. The upper layer, indeed, seemed fairy by comparison with this  terror born of the lust for blood, thick with the anguish of human  sacrificial victims.    Upper! Then I was already sinking; my feet were caught; I was actually  in it! What atavistic strain,"]]]
