The sole was of wood, and stuck full of nails. Caius  Caesar Caligula, the fourth Roman Emperor, the son of Germanicus and  Agrippina, derived his surname from \"Caliga,\" as having been born in  the army, and afterwards bred up in the habit of a common soldier; he  wore this military shoe in conformity to those of the common soldiers,  with a view of engaging their affections. The caliga was the badge, or  symbol of a soldier; whence to take away the caliga and belt, imported  a dismissal or cashiering. P.T.W.    _The Damary Oak-tree._--At Blandford Forum, Dorsetshire, stood the  famous Damary Oak, which was rooted up for firing in 1755. It measured  75 feet high, and the branches extended 72 feet; the trunk at the  bottom was 68 feet in circumference, and 23 feet in diameter. It had  a cavity in its trunk 15 feet wide. Ale was sold in it till after the  Restoration; and when the town was burnt down in 1731, it served as an  abode for one family.--_Family Topographer_, vol. ii.    _Brent Tor Church, Devonshire, situate upon a rock._--On Brent Tor is  a church, in which is appositely inscribed from Scripture, \"Upon this  rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail  against it.\" It is said that the parishioners make weekly atonement  for their sins, for they cannot go to the church without the previous  penance of climbing the steep; and the pastor is frequently obliged to  humble himself upon his hands and knees before he can reach the house  of prayer. Tradition says it was erected by a merchant to commemorate  his escape from shipwreck on the coast, in consequence of this Tor  serving as a guide to the pilot. There is not sufficient earth to bury  the dead. At the foot of the Tor resided, in 1809, Sarah Williams,  aged 109 years. She never lived further out of the parish of Brent  Tor, than the adjoining one: she had had twelve children, and a few  years before her death cut five new teeth.--Ibid.    _The Dairyman's Daughter._--In Arreton churchyard, Isle of Wight, is  a tombstone, erected in 1822, by subscription, to mark the grave of  Elizabeth Wallbridge, the humble individual whose story of piety and  virtue, written by the Rev. Leigh Richmond, under the title of the  \"Dairyman's Daughter,\" has attained an almost unexampled circulation.  Her cottage at Branston, about a mile distant, is much visited.--Ibid.    _Singular distribution of common land in Somersetshire_.--In the  parishes of Congresbury and Puxton were two large pieces of common  land, called East and West Dolemoors (from the Saxon word dol, a  portion or share,) which were occupied till within these few years in  the following manner:---The land was divided into single acres, each  bearing a peculiar mark, cut in the turf, such as a horn, an ox, a  horse, a cross, an oven, &c. On the Saturday before Old Midsummer  Day, the several proprietors of contiguous estates, or their tenants,  assembled on these commons, with a number of apples marked with  similar figures, which were distributed by a boy to each of the  commoners from a bag. At the close of the distribution, each person  repaired to the allotment with the figure corresponding to the one  upon his apple, and took possession of it for the ensuing year. Four  acres were reserved to pay the expenses of an entertainment at the  house of the overseer of the Dolemoors, where the evening was spent in  festivity.--Ibid.    _Anna Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury._--At Avington Park, in Hampshire,  resided the notorious and infamous Anna-Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury,  who held the horse of the Duke of Buckingham while he fought and  killed her husband. Charles II frequently made it the scene of his  licentious pleasures; and the old green-house is said to have been the  apartment in which the royal sensualist was entertained.--Ibid.           *       *       *       *       *    _Erratum_--In the lines, by J.

There came a rap at the door and Miss Smith, the typist, entered. \"Miss  Phil Abingdon and Doctor McMurdoch,\" she said.    \"Good heavens!\" muttered Harley. \"So soon? Why, she can only just--\" He  checked himself. \"Show them in, Miss Smith,\" he directed.    As the typist went out, followed by Innes, Paul Harley found himself  thinking of the photograph in Sir Charles Abingdon's library and waiting  with an almost feverish expectancy for the appearance of the original.    Almost immediately Phil Abingdon came in, accompanied by the sepulchral  Doctor McMurdoch. And Harley found himself wondering whether her eyes  were really violet-coloured or whether intense emotion heroically  repressed had temporarily lent them that appearance.    Surprise was the predominant quality of his first impression. Sir  Charles Abingdon's daughter was so exceedingly vital--petite and  slender, yet instinct with force. The seeming repose of the photograph  was misleading. That her glance could be naive he realized--as it could  also be gay--and now her eyes were sad with a sadness so deep as to  dispel the impression of lightness created by her dainty form, her  alluring, mobile lips, and the fascinating, wavy, red-brown hair.    She did not wear mourning. He recalled that there had been no time to  procure it. She was exquisitely and fashionably dressed, and even the  pallor of grief could not rob her cheeks of the bloom born of Devon  sunshine. He had expected her to be pretty. He was surprised to find her  lovely.    Doctor McMurdoch stood silent in the doorway, saying nothing by way  of introduction. But nothing was necessary. Phil Abingdon came forward  quite naturally--and quite naturally Paul Harley discovered her little  gloved hand to lie clasped between both his own. It was more like a  reunion than a first meeting and was so laden with perfect understanding  that, even yet, speech seemed scarcely worth while.    Thinking over that moment, in later days, Paul Harley remembered that  he had been prompted by some small inner voice to say: \"So you have come  back?\" It was recognition. Of the hundreds of men and women who came  into his life for a while, and ere long went out of it again, he knew,  by virtue of that sixth sense of his, that Phil Abingdon had come to  stay--whether for joy or sorrow he could not divine.    It was really quite brief--that interval of silence--although perhaps  long enough to bridge the ages.    \"How brave of you, Miss Abingdon!\" said Harley. \"How wonderfully brave  of you!\"    \"She's an Abingdon,\" came the deep tones of Doctor McMurdoch. \"She  arrived only two hours ago and here she is.\"    \"There can be no rest for me, Doctor,\" said the girl, and strove  valiantly to control her voice, \"until this dreadful doubt is removed.  Mr. Harley\"--she turned to him appealingly--\"please don't study my  feelings in the least; I can bear anything--now; just tell me what  happened. Oh! I had to come. I felt that I had to come.\"    As Paul Harley placed an armchair for his visitor, his glance met that  of Doctor McMurdoch, and in the gloomy eyes he read admiration of this  girl who could thus conquer the inherent weakness of her sex and at such  an hour and after a dreadful ordeal set her hand to the task which fate  had laid upon her.    Doctor McMurdoch sat down on a chair beside the door, setting his silk  hat upon the floor and clasping his massive chin with his hand.    \"I will endeavour to do as you wish, Miss Abingdon,\" said Harley,  glancing anxiously at the physician.    But Doctor McMurdoch returned only a dull stare. It was evident  that this man of stone was as clay in the hands of Phil Abingdon. He  deprecated the strain which she was imposing upon her nervous system,  already overwrought to the danger point, but he was helpless for all his  dour obstinacy. Harley, looking down at the girl's profile, read a new  meaning into the firm line of her chin. He was conscious of an insane  desire to put his arms around this new acquaintance who seemed in some  indefinable yet definite way to belong to him and to whisper the tragic  story he had to tell, comforting her the while.    He began to relate what had taken place at the first interview, when Sir  Charles had told him of the menace which he had believed to hang over  his life. He spoke slowly, deliberately, choosing his words with a view  to sparing Phil Abingdon's feelings as far as possible.    She made no comment throughout, but her fingers alternately tightened  and relaxed their hold upon the arms of the chair in which she was  seated. Once, at some reference to words spoken by her father, her  sensitive lips began to quiver and Harley, watching her, paused. She  held the chair arms more tightly. \"Please go on, Mr. Harley,\" she said.    The words were spoken in a very low voice, but the speaker looked up  bravely, and Harley, reassured, proceeded uninterruptedly to the end of  the story. Then:    \"At some future time, Miss Abingdon,\" he concluded, \"I hope you will  allow me to call upon you. There is so much to be discussed--\"    Again Phil Abingdon looked up into his face. \"I have forced myself  to come to see you to-day,\" she said, \"because I realize there is no  service I can do poor dad so important as finding out--\"    \"I understand,\" Harley interrupted, gently. \"But--\"    \"No, no.\" Phil Abingdon shook her head rebelliously. \"Please ask me what  you want to know. I came for that.\"    He met the glance of violet eyes, and understood something of Doctor  McMurdoch's helplessness. He found his thoughts again wandering into  strange, wild byways and was only recalled to the realities by the  dry, gloomy voice of the physician. \"Go on, Mr. Harley,\" said Doctor  McMurdoch. \"She has grand courage.\"        CHAPTER VII. CONFESSIONS    Paul Harley crossed the room and stood in front of the tall Burmese  cabinet. He experienced the utmost difficulty in adopting a judicial  attitude toward his beautiful visitor. Proximity increased his mental  confusion. Therefore he stood on the opposite side of the office ere  beginning to question her.    \"In the first place, Miss Abingdon,\" he said, speaking very  deliberately, \"do you attach any particular significance to the term  'Fire-Tongue'?\"    Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch. \"None at all, Mr.  Harley,\" she replied. \"The doctor has already told me of--\"    \"You know why I ask?\" She inclined her head.    \"And Mr. Nicol Brinn? Have you met this gentleman?\"    \"Never. I know that Dad had met him and was very much interested in  him.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"I have no idea. He told me that he thought Mr. Brinn one of the most  singular characters he had ever known. But beyond describing his rooms  in Piccadilly, which had impressed him as extraordinary, he said very  little about Mr. Brinn. He sounded interesting and \"--she hesitated and  her eyes filled with tears--\"I asked Dad to invite him home.\" Again she  paused. This retrospection, by making the dead seem to live again, added  to the horror of her sudden bereavement, and Harley would most gladly  have spared her more. \"Dad seemed strangely disinclined to do so,\" she  added.    At that the keen investigator came to life within Harley. \"Your father  did not appear anxious to bring Mr. Brinn to his home?\" he asked,  eagerly.    \"Not at all anxious. This was all the more strange because Dad invited  Mr. Brinn to his club.\"    \"He gave no reason for his refusal?\"    \"Oh, there was no refusal, Mr. Harley. He merely evaded the matter. I  never knew why.\"    \"H'm,\" muttered Harley. \"And now, Miss Abingdon, can you enlighten  me respecting the identity of the Oriental gentleman with whom he had  latterly become acquainted?\"    Phil Abingdon glanced rapidly at Doctor McMurdoch and then lowered  her head. She did not answer at once. \"I know to whom you refer, Mr.  Harley,\" she said, finally. \"But it was I who had made this gentleman's  acquaintance. My father did not know him.\"    \"Then I wonder why he mentioned him?\" murmured Harley.    \"That I cannot imagine. I have been wondering ever since Doctor  McMurdoch told me.\"    \"You recognize the person to whom Sir Charles referred?\"    \"Yes. He could only have meant Ormuz Khan.\"    \"Ormuz Khan--\" echoed Harley. \"Where have I heard that name?\"    \"He visits England periodically, I believe. In fact, he has a house  somewhere near London. I met him at Lady Vail's.\"    \"Lady Vail's? His excellency moves, then, in diplomatic circles? Odd  that I cannot place him.\"    \"I have a vague idea, Mr. Harley, that he is a financier. I seem to have  heard that he had something to do with the Imperial Bank of Iran.\" She  glanced naively at Harley. \"Is there such a bank?\" she asked.    \"There is,\" he replied. \"Am I to understand that Ormuz Khan is a  Persian?\"    \"I believe he is a Persian,\" said Phil Abingdon, rather confusedly. \"To  be quite frank, I know very little about him.\"    Paul Harley gazed steadily at the speaker for a moment. \"Can you think  of any reason why Sir Charles should have worried about this gentleman?\"  he asked.    The girl lowered her head again. \"He paid me a lot of attention,\" she  finally confessed.    \"This meeting at Lady Vail's, then, was the first of many?\"    \"Oh, no--not of many! I saw him two or three times. But he began to  send me most extravagant presents. I suppose it was his Oriental way of  paying a compliment, but Dad objected.\"    \"Of course he would. He knew his Orient and his Oriental. I assume, Miss  Abingdon, that you were in England during the years that your father  lived in the East?\"    \"Yes. I was at school. I have never been in the East.\"    Paul Harley hesitated. He found himself upon dangerously delicate ground  and was temporarily at a loss as to how to proceed. Unexpected aid came  from the taciturn Doctor McMurdoch.    \"He never breathed a word of this to"]]]
