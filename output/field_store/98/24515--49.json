The book-keeper said his trouble always came  on two hours after eating, and asked if he might take a bit of the  thing to his room.  'Certainly,' says B---, and as the paw-paw  wasn't cut at that meal the book-keeper quietly took it off whole  with him.    \"In the morning time he did not turn up.  B---, just before  breakfast, went to his room and he wasn't there, but he noticed the  paw-paw was on the bed and that was all, so he thought the book-  keeper must have gone for a walk, being, as it were, a bit too  tender to have gone on the fly as yet.  So he just told the store  clerk to tell the people to return him to the firm when they found  him straying around lost, and thought no more about it, being, as it  was, mail-day, and him busy.    \"Well!  Fortunately the steward boy put that paw-paw on the table  again for twelve o'clock chop.  If it hadn't been for that, not a  living soul would have known the going of the book-keeper.  For when  B--- cut it open, there, right inside it, were nine steel trouser-  buttons, a Waterbury watch, and the poor young fellow's keys.  For  you see, instead of his digesting his dinner with that paw-paw, the  paw-paw took charge and digested him, dinner and all, and when B---  interrupted it, it was just getting a grip on the steel things.  There's an awful lot of pepsine in a paw-paw, and if you hang, etc.,  etc.\"    I collapsed, feebly murmuring that it was very interesting, but sad  for the poor young fellow's friends.    \"Not necessarily,\" said the old coaster.  So he had the last word,  and never again will I attempt to alter the ways of the genuine old  coaster.  What you have got to do with him is to be very thankful  you have had the honour of knowing him.    Still I think we do over-estimate the value of the papaw, although I  certainly did once myself hang the leg of a goat no mortal man could  have got tooth into, on to a papaw tree with a bit of string for the  night.  In the morning it was clean gone, string and all; but  whether it was the pepsine, the papaine, or a purloining pagan that  was the cause of its departure there was no evidence to show.  Yet I  am myself, as Hans Breitmann says, \"still skebdigal\" as to the  papaw, and I dare say you are too.    But I must forthwith stop writing about the Gold Coast, or I shall  go on telling you stories and wasting your time, not to mention the  danger of letting out those which would damage the nerves of the  cultured of temperate climes, such as those relating to the youth  who taught himself French from a six months' method book; of the man  who wore brass buttons; the moving story of three leeches and two  gentlemen; the doctor up a creek; and the reason why you should not  eat pork along here because all the natives have either got the  guinea-worm, or kraw-kraw or ulcers; and then the pigs go and--dear  me! it was a near thing that time.  I'll leave off at once.        CHAPTER II.  FERNANDO PO AND THE BUBIS.        Giving some account of the occupation of this island by the whites  and the manners and customs of the blacks peculiar to it.    Our outward voyage really terminated at Calabar, and it terminated  gorgeously in fireworks and what not, in honour of the coming of  Lady MacDonald, the whole settlement, white and black, turning out  to do her honour to the best of its ability; and its ability in this  direction was far greater than, from my previous knowledge of Coast  conditions, I could have imagined possible.  Before Sir Claude  MacDonald settled down again to local work, he and Lady MacDonald  crossed to Fernando Po, still in the Batanga, and I accompanied  them, thus getting an opportunity of seeing something of Spanish  official circles.    I had heard sundry noble legends of Fernando Po, and seen the coast  and a good deal of the island before, but although I had heard much  of the Governor, I had never met him until I went up to his  residence with Lady MacDonald and the Consul-General.  He was a  delightful person, who, as a Spanish naval officer, some time  resident in Cuba, had picked up a lot of English, with a strong  American accent clinging to it.  He gave a most moving account of  how, as soon as his appointment as Governor was announced, all his  friends and acquaintances carefully explained to him that this  appointment was equivalent to execution, only more uncomfortable in  the way it worked out.  During the outward voyage this was daily  confirmed by the stories told by the sailors and merchants  personally acquainted with the place, who were able to support their  information with dates and details of the decease of the victims to  the climate.    Still he kept up a good heart, but when he arrived at the island he  found his predecessor had died of fever; and he himself, the day  after landing, went down with a bad attack and he was placed in a  bed--the same bed, he was mournfully informed, in which the last  Governor had expired.  Then he did believe, all in one awful lump,  all the stories he had been told, and added to their horrors a few  original conceptions of death and purgatory, and a lot of  transparent semi-formed images of his own delirium.  Fortunately  both prophecy and personal conviction alike miscarried, and the  Governor returned from the jaws of death.  But without a moment's  delay he withdrew from the Port of Clarence and went up the mountain  to Basile, which is in the neighbourhood of the highest native  village, where he built himself a house, and around it a little  village of homes for the most unfortunate set of human beings I have  ever laid eye on.  They are the remnant of a set of Spanish  colonists, who had been located at some spot in the Spanish  possessions in Morocco, and finding that place unfit to support  human life, petitioned the Government to remove them and let them  try colonising elsewhere.    The Spanish Government just then had one of its occasional fits of  interest in Fernando Po, and so shipped them here, and the Governor,  a most kindly and generous man, who would have been a credit to any  country, established them and their families around him at Basile,  to share with him the advantages of the superior elevation;  advantages he profoundly believed in, and which he has always placed  at the disposal of any sick white man on the island, of whatsoever  nationality or religion.  Undoubtedly the fever is not so severe at  Basile as in the lowlands, but there are here the usual drawbacks to  West African high land, namely an over supply of rain, and equally  saturating mists, to say nothing of sudden and extreme alternations  of temperature, and so the colonists still fall off, and their  children die continuously from the various entozoa which abound upon  the island.    When the Governor first settled upon the mountain he was very  difficult to get at for business purposes, and a telephone was  therefore run up to him from Clarence through the forest, and Spain  at large felt proud at this dashing bit of enterprise in modern  appliance.  Alas! the primaeval forests of Fernando Po were also  charmed with the new toy, and they talked to each other on it with  their leaves and branches to such an extent that a human being could  not get a word in edgeways.  So the Governor had to order the  construction of a road along the course of the wire to keep the  trees off it, but unfortunately the telephone is still an uncertain  means of communication, because another interruption in its  usefulness still afflicts it, namely the indigenous natives' habit  of stealing bits out of its wire, for they are fully persuaded that  they cannot be found out in their depredations provided they take  sufficient care that they are not caught in the act.  The Governor  is thus liable to be cut off at any moment in the middle of a  conversation with Clarence, and the amount of \"Hellos\"  \"Are you  theres?\" and \"Speak louder, pleases\" in Spanish that must at such  times be poured out and wasted in the lonely forests before the  break is realised and an unfortunate man sent off as a messenger, is  terrible to think of.    But nothing would persuade the Governor to come a mile down towards  Clarence until the day he should go there to join the vessel that  was to take him home, and I am bound to say he looked as if the  method was a sound one, for he was an exceedingly healthy, cheery-  looking man.    Fernando Po is said to be a comparatively modern island, and not so  very long ago to have been connected with the mainland, the strait  between them being only nineteen miles across, and not having any  deep soundings. {37}  I fail to see what grounds there are for these  ideas, for though Fernando Po's volcanoes are not yet extinct, but  merely have their fires banked, yet, on the other hand, the island  has been in existence sufficiently long to get itself several  peculiar species of animals and plants, and that is a thing which  takes time.  I myself do not believe that this island was ever  connected with the continent, but arose from the ocean as the result  of a terrific upheaval in the chain of volcanic activity which runs  across the Atlantic from the Cameroon Mountains in a SSW. direction  to Anno Bom island, and possibly even to the Tristan da Cunha group  midway between the Cape and South America.    These volcanic islands are all of extreme beauty and fertility.  They consist of Fernando Po (10,190 ft.); Principe (3000 ft.); San  Thome (6,913 ft.); and Anno Bom (1,350 ft.).  San Thome and Principe  are Portuguese possessions, Fernando Po and Anno Bom Spanish, and  they are all exceedingly unhealthy.  San Thome is still called \"The  Dutchman's Church-yard,\" on account of the devastation its climate  wrought among the Hollanders when they once occupied it; as they  seem, at one time or another, to have occupied all Portuguese  possessions out here, during the long war these two powers waged  with each other for supremacy in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#8)"],[1,"allow her to act in accordance with the laws which he had  established.  On this supposition, I, in the first place, described  this matter, and essayed to represent it in such a manner that to my  mind there can be nothing clearer and more intelligible, except what  has been recently said regarding God and the soul; for I even expressly  supposed that it possessed none of those forms or qualities which are  so debated in the schools, nor in general anything the knowledge of  which is not so natural to our minds that no one can so much as imagine  himself ignorant of it.  Besides, I have pointed out what are the laws  of nature; and, with no other principle upon which to found my  reasonings except the infinite perfection of God, I endeavored to  demonstrate all those about which there could be any room for doubt,  and to prove that they are such, that even if God had created more  worlds, there could have been none in which these laws were not  observed.  Thereafter, I showed how the greatest part of the matter of  this chaos must, in accordance with these laws, dispose and arrange  itself in such a way as to present the appearance of heavens; how in  the meantime some of its parts must compose an earth and some planets  and comets, and others a sun and fixed stars.  And, making a digression  at this stage on the subject of light, I expounded at considerable  length what the nature of that light must be which is found in the sun  and the stars, and how thence in an instant of time it traverses the  immense spaces of the heavens, and how from the planets and comets it  is reflected towards the earth.  To this I likewise added much  respecting the substance, the situation, the motions, and all the  different qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had  said enough respecting them to show that there is nothing observable in  the heavens or stars of our system that must not, or at least may not  appear precisely alike in those of the system which I described.  I  came next to speak of the earth in particular, and to show how, even  though I had expressly supposed that God had given no weight to the  matter of which it is composed, this should not prevent all its parts  from tending exactly to its center; how with water and air on its  surface, the disposition of the heavens and heavenly bodies, more  especially of the moon, must cause a flow and ebb, like in all its  circumstances to that observed in our seas, as also a certain current  both of water and air from east to west, such as is likewise observed  between the tropics; how the mountains, seas, fountains, and rivers  might naturally be formed in it, and the metals produced in the mines,  and the plants grow in the fields and in general, how all the bodies  which are commonly denominated mixed or composite might be generated  and, among other things in the discoveries alluded to inasmuch as  besides the stars, I knew nothing except fire which produces light, I  spared no pains to set forth all that pertains to its nature,--the  manner of its production and support, and to explain how heat is  sometimes found without light, and light without heat; to show how it  can induce various colors upon different bodies and other diverse  qualities; how it reduces some to a liquid state and hardens others;  how it can consume almost all bodies, or convert them into ashes and  smoke; and finally, how from these ashes, by the mere intensity of its  action, it forms glass:  for as this transmutation of ashes into glass  appeared to me as wonderful as any other in nature, I took a special  pleasure in describing it.  I was not, however, disposed, from these  circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the  manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the  first such as it was to be.  But this is certain, and an opinion  commonly received among theologians, that the action by which he now  sustains it is the same with that by which he originally created it; so  that even although he had from the beginning given it no other form  than that of chaos, provided only he had established certain laws of  nature, and had lent it his concurrence to enable it to act as it is  wont to do, it may be believed, without discredit to the miracle of  creation, that, in this way alone, things purely material might, in  course of time, have become such as we observe them at present; and  their nature is much more easily conceived when they are beheld coming  in this manner gradually into existence, than when they are only  considered as produced at once in a finished and perfect state.    From the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to  animals, and particularly to man.  But since I had not as yet  sufficient knowledge to enable me to treat of these in the same manner  as of the rest, that is to say, by deducing effects from their causes,  and by showing from what elements and in what manner nature must  produce them, I remained satisfied with the supposition that God formed  the body of man wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external  shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs, of  the same matter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no  rational soul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or  sensitive soul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without  light, such as I had already described, and which I thought was not  different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it  is dry, or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are  run clear of the fruit.  For, when I examined the kind of functions  which might, as consequences of this supposition, exist in this body, I  found precisely all those which may exist in us independently of all  power of thinking, and consequently without being in any measure owing  to the soul; in other words, to that part of us which is distinct from  the body, and of which it has been said above that the nature  distinctively consists in thinking, functions in which the animals void  of reason may be said wholly to resemble us; but among which I could  not discover any of those that, as dependent on thought alone, belong  to us as men, while, on the other hand, I did afterwards discover these  as soon as I supposed God to have created a rational soul, and to have  annexed it to this body in a particular manner which I described.    But, in order to show how I there handled this matter, I mean here to  give the explication of the motion of the heart and arteries, which, as  the first and most general motion observed in animals, will afford the  means of readily determining what should be thought of all the rest.  And that there may be less difficulty in understanding what I am about  to say on this subject, I advise those who are not versed in anatomy,  before they commence the perusal of these observations, to take the  trouble of getting dissected in their presence the heart of some large  animal possessed of lungs (for this is throughout sufficiently like the  human), and to have shown to them its two ventricles or cavities:  in  the first place, that in the right side, with which correspond two very  ample tubes, viz., the hollow vein (vena cava), which is the principal  receptacle of the blood, and the trunk of the tree, as it were, of  which all the other veins in the body are branches; and the arterial  vein (vena arteriosa), inappropriately so denominated, since it is in  truth only an artery, which, taking its rise in the heart, is divided,  after passing out from it, into many branches which presently disperse  themselves all over the lungs; in the second place, the cavity in the  left side, with which correspond in the same manner two canals in size  equal to or larger than the preceding, viz., the venous artery (arteria  venosa), likewise inappropriately thus designated, because it is simply  a vein which comes from the lungs, where it is divided into many  branches, interlaced with those of the arterial vein, and those of the  tube called the windpipe, through which the air we breathe enters; and  the great artery which, issuing from the heart, sends its branches all  over the body.  I should wish also that such persons were carefully  shown the eleven pellicles which, like so many small valves, open and  shut the four orifices that are in these two cavities, viz., three at  the entrance of the hollow veins where they are disposed in such a  manner as by no means to prevent the blood which it contains from  flowing into the right ventricle of the heart, and yet exactly to  prevent its flowing out; three at the entrance to the arterial vein,  which, arranged in a manner exactly the opposite of the former, readily  permit the blood contained in this cavity to pass into the lungs, but  hinder that contained in the lungs from returning to this cavity; and,  in like manner, two others at the mouth of the venous artery, which  allow the blood from the lungs to flow into the left cavity of the  heart, but preclude its return; and three at the mouth of the great  artery, which suffer the blood to flow from the heart, but prevent its  reflux.  Nor do we need to seek any other reason for the number of  these pellicles beyond this that the orifice of the venous artery being  of an oval shape from the nature of its situation, can be adequately  closed with two, whereas the others being round are more conveniently  closed with three.  Besides, I wish such persons to observe that the  grand artery and the arterial vein are of much harder and firmer  texture than the venous artery and the hollow vein; and that the two  last expand before entering the heart, and there form, as it were, two  pouches denominated the auricles of the heart, which are composed of a  substance similar to that of the heart itself; and that there is always  more warmth in the heart than in any other part of "]]]
