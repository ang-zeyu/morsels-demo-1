But the gates open and after the eager, intense meetings, and the more  matter-of-fact assumption of babies and bundles, the red-capped  porters, with their lucky burdens of fashionable traveling-cases,  pilot or follow the sirs and mesdames of fortune. Among these is one  whose handsome face is mellowed by softening, early-gray hair, and  whose perfect attire and tenderness in greeting our doctor at once  associate mother and son. She has just come down the Hudson on one of  the few seriously difficult errands of her fifty-six years.    Two weeks have passed. The room is stark bare, save for two  mattresses, a heap of disheveled bed clothes, and two men. The hours  are small and the dim, guarded light, intended to soften, probably  intensifies the weirdness of the picture. The suspiciously plain  woodwork is enameled in a dull monochrome. The windows are guarded  with protecting screens. One man, an attendant, lies orderly on his  pallet; the other, a slender figure in pajamas, crouches in a corner.  His hair is bestraggled; his face is livid; his pupils, widely  dilated; his dry lips part now and then as he mutters and mumbles  inarticulately or chuckles inanely. Now starting, again abstracted, he  is capable of responding for a moment only, as the attendant offers  him his nourishment. A few seconds later he is groaning and twisting,  obviously in pain, pain which is forgotten as quickly, as he reaches  here and there for imaginary, flying, floating things. Real sleep has  not closed his eyes for now nearly three nights. He is delirious in an  artificial, merciful semi-stupor, which is saving him the untold  sufferings of morphine denial. Before this unhappy Dr. Abbott stretch  long, wearisome weeks of readjustment, weeks of physical pain and  mental discomfort, weeks, let us hope, of soul-prodding remorse. His  only chance for a future worth spending lies in months of physical  reeducation, of teaching his femininely soft body the hardness which  stands for manliness; for him must be multiplied days of mental  reorganization to change the will of a weakling into saving  masterfulness; nor will these suffice unless, in the white heat of a  moral revelation, the false tinsel woven into the fabric of his  character be consumed. For months he must deny himself the luxuries,  even many of the comforts, his mother's wealth is eager to give. Yet  these weeks and months of development may never be, for in a short  time he will again be legally accountable, and probably will resent  and refuse constructive discipline, and return to a satin-upholstered  life--his cigarettes, his wine-dinners, his liquors, and his \"rotten  feeling\" mornings after--then to his morphin and to his certain  degradation. And why should this be? Time must turn back the hands on  her dial thirty-three years that we may know.    The fine Abbott home was surrounded by a small suburban estate near  Philadelphia, a generation ago; we have met the then young mistress of  the mansion, at the Grand Central Station. It was a home of richness,  a home of discriminating wealth, a home of artistic beauty; it was a  home of nervous tension. This neurotic intensity was not of the cheap  helter-skelter, melodramatic sort; there was a splendid veneer of  control. But all the mother's plans and activities depended on the  moods, whims and impulses of little Lawrence, the only child, then  glorying in the hey-day of his three-year-old babyhood. It was a  household kept in dignified turmoil by this child of wealth, who  needed a poor boy's chance to be a lovable, hearty, normal chap. It  was overattention to his health, with its hundreds of impending  possibilities; to his food, with the unsolvable perplexity of what the  doctor advised and of what the young sire wanted. More of  satisfaction, perhaps, was found in clothing the youth, as he cared  less about these details; still, an unending variety of weights and  materials was provided that all hygienic and social requirements might  be adequately met. Anxious thought was daily spent that his play and  playmates might be equally pleasing and free from danger. Almost  prayerful investigation was made of the servants who ministered, and  tense, sleepless hours were spent by this nervous mother striving to  wisely decide between the dangers to her child of travel and those  other dangers of heated summers and bleak winters at home. Frequent  trips into the city and frequent visitations from the city were made,  that expert advice be obtained. Consultations were followed by counter  consultations and conferences which but added the mocking counsel of  indecision. And the marble of her beauty began to show faint marrings  chiseled by tension and anxiety--for was not Lawrence her only son!    It was a home of double standards. The father was a wholesome,  serious-minded, essentially reasonable, Cornell man. His ideas were  manly and from time to time he laid down certain principles, and when  at home, with apparently little effort, exacted and secured a ready  and certainly not unhappy, obedience from his son. But business  interests and responsibilities were large and the bracing tonic of his  association with the boy was all too passing to put much blood-  richness into the pallor of the child's developing character.  Moreover, this intermittent helpfulness was more than counteracted by  the mother's disloyal, though unconscious dishonesty. Hers was an  open, if need be a furtive, overattention and overstimulation, an  inveterate surrender to the sweet tyranny of her son's childish whims.  There was probably nothing malicious in her many little plans which  kept the father out of the nursery and ignorant of much of their boy's  tutelage. The mother was only repeating fully in principle, and  largely in detail, her own rearing; and had she not \"turned out to be  one of the favored few?\"    The suburban special went into a crash, and all that a fine father  might have done through future years to neutralize the unwholesome  training of a nervous mother was lost. In fact, her power for harm was  now multiplied. The large properties and business were hers through  life, and with husband gone, and so tragically, there was increased  opportunity, and unquestionably more reason, for the intensification  of her motherly care. So the fate of a fine man's son is left in the  hands of a servile mother.    It now became a home of restrained extravagance. The table was fairly  smothered with rare and rich foods. Fine wines and imported liquors  entered into sauces and seasonings. The boy's playroom was a veritable  toy-shop, with its hundreds of useless and unused playthings. Long  before any capacity for understanding enjoyment had come, this  unfortunate child had lost all love for the simple. With Mrs. Abbott,  it was always \"the best that money can buy\"--unwittingly, the worst  for her child's character. It was a home of formal morality. Sunday  morning services were religiously attended; charities of free giving,  the giving which did not cost personal effort, were never failing. It  was a home of selfish unselfishness. All weaknesses in the son  throughout the passing years were winked at. Never from his mother did  Lawrence know that sympathy, sometimes hard, often abrupt, never  pampering, which breeds self-help.    Lawrence went to the most painstakingly selected, private preparatory-  schools, and later, as good Abbotts had done for generations, entered  Cornell. He had no taste for business. For years he had been  associated with gifted and agreeable doctors; he liked the dignity of  the title; so, after two years of academic work, he entered the  medical department and graduated with his class. These were good  years. His was not a nature of active evil. Many of his impulses were  quite wholesome, and college fraternity camaraderie brought out much  that was worthy. In the face of maternal anxiety and protest, he went  out for track, made good, stuck to his training and in his senior year  represented the scarlet and white, getting a second in the  intercollegiate low hurdles. Another trolley crash now, and he might  have been saved!    All through his college days a morbid fear had shortened his mother's  sleep hours with its wretchedness. Her boy was everything that would  attract attractive women. Away from her influence he might marry  beneath him, so all the refinements of intrigue and diplomacy were  utilized that a certain daughter of blood and wealth might become her  daughter-in-law. The two women were clever, and woe it was that his  commencement-day was soon followed by his wedding-day. No more  sumptuous wedding-trip could have been arranged-to California, to the  Islands of the Pacific, to India, to Egypt, then a comfortable  meandering through Europe. A year of joy-living they planned that they  might learn to know each other, with all the ministers of happiness in  attendance. But the disagreements of two petted children made murky  many a day of their prolonged festal journey, and beclouded for them  both many days of the elaborate home-making after the home-coming. And  the murkiness and cloudiness were not dissipated when parenthood was  theirs. Neither had learned the first page in Life's text-book of  happiness, and as both, could not have their way at the same time,  rifts grew into chasms which widened and deepened. Then the wife  sought attentions she did not get at home in social circles and the  husband sought comforts his wife and his home did not give, in drink  and fast living, later with cocain and morphin. The ugliness of it all  could not be lessened by the divorce, which became inevitable. By  mutual agreement, the rearing of the child was intrusted to the  father's mother, who to-day shapes its destiny with the same  unwholesome solicitude which denied"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],[0,"New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#8)"],[1,"as representing  the sum of his extensive research upon the subject and its elaborate  presentation:        How truly surprising it is to find the Mexicans, who seem to      have been quite unacquainted with the doctrines of the migration      of the soul and the metempsychosis, should have believed in the      incarnation of the only son of their supreme god Tonacatecutle.      For Mexican mythology speaking of no other son of that God except      Quetzalcohuatl, who was born of Chimalman, the virgin of Tula,      without connection with man, and by his breath alone, (by which      may be signified his word or his will, announced to Chimalman by      word of mouth of the celestial messenger, whom he dispatched to      inform her that she should conceive a son), it must be presumed      that Quetzalcohuatl was his only son. [35] Other arguments might      be adduced to show, that the Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl      was both god and man, that he had previously to his incarnation,      existed from all eternity, [36] that he had created both the world      and man, [37] that he descended from heaven to reform the world by      penance, that he was born with the perfect use of reason, that he      preached a new law, and, being king of Tula, was crucified for the      sins of mankind, as is obscurely insinuated by the interpreter of      the Vatican Codex, plainly declared in the traditions of Yucatan,      and mysteriously represented in the Mexican paintings. [38]        It would be a useless repetition of facts already stated in the      preceding pages of the present volume, to undertake separately to      prove all these points; and we shall confine ourselves in this      place to the three first very important articles. The reflection      must have suggested itself to those who have perused the New      Testament, that Christ is as frequently distinguished there by      the appellation of the \"Son of Man,\" as by that of the \"Son of      God,\" in reference no doubt to his humanity, and to the famous      prophecy contained in the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of      Isaiah: \"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:\"      which Christians, on the authority of many passages in the four      Gospels, apply to Christ, although the Jews some times interpret      it of the Messiah, and some times of King Hezekiah. The Mexicans      bestowed the appellation of Topilitzin on Quetzalcohuatl, the      literal signification of which is \"our son,\" or \"our child,\"      the proper name being compounded of \"to,\" \"our,\" and \"piltzin,\"      defined by Alonso de Molina in his rare and copious vocabulary of      the Mexican and Spanish languages to be mino o nina, \"a boy or a      girl,\" and associated by him with the cognate terms of \"piltontli\"      and \"pilzintia;\" and it may not be unreasonably assumed, since      analogies, which are numerous and not isolated, as their number      increases, increase also their ratio of probability, not only that      the Mexicans were acquainted with Isaiah's famous prophecy, but to      mark their belief of the accomplishment of that prophecy, in the      person of Quetzalcohuatl, that they named him Topiltzin; no less      account of his having been born from a virgin of the daughters of      men, then because another equally celebrated prediction of the      same prophet declared that he should receive a name from that very      circumstance: \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign,      Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his      name Immanuel.\" And the proper name Topilitzin does in fact bear      a signification corresponding, if not literally, yet entirely in      substance with that of Immanuel: since \"God with us,\" which is the      interpretation of the Hebrew name, means God domiciliated amongst      men; and the full force of the expression is preserved in the term      Topilitzin, which might be interpreted the Son of Man, or God on a      level with men; for the Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl took      human nature upon him, partaking of all infirmities of man, and      was not exempt from sorrow, pain, or death, and that he suffered      voluntarily to atone for the sins of mankind. [39]    As already remarked, there is much attributed to this Deity of native  American tradition that seems incompatible with the character of  Messiah, and with his labors while in the western hemisphere; but for  all that one may see in outline here the leading truths respecting the  Son of God as made known to the Nephites through prophecies and the  Christ's advent among them, all of which is set forth in the Book of  Mormon; while that which is not congruous to Messiah and his mission to  the Nephites, results--as already pointed out--from the confusion of  a number of traditions concerning several other great characters who  have figured in native American history, and of whom the Book of Mormon  speaks. But, in the foregoing excerpts from the works of those skilled  in the lore of ancient America, we have the account of \"The great or  the glorious Man of the country,\" [40] that can be no other than the  Hebrew Messiah--the Jesus Christ of the Book of Mormon. There are the  signs of his birth: the signs of his death; his sudden advent among the  people; his personal appearance--not incompatible with the personal  appearance of Messiah, but rather in harmony with it; his birth of a  virgin; his being the only son of God; his name signifying \"God with  man;\" his being the creator of heaven and earth; his crucifixion for  the sins of the world; his being peculiarly \"the Lord\" to whom men  prayed; his love of peace, his hatred of war; his respect for existing  religion, yet his enlargement of it and the addition of religious  rites and ceremonies; his teaching the people perfectly in their own  tongue, yet also in new and honied words; his compassion for the sick,  and healing them; his choosing special disciples to teach his religion  and making them priests of the same order as himself; the beauty and  gentleness of his religion that stands in such marked contrast to the  subsequent harsh and sanguinary superstition that darkened the lives of  the natives; his instructions as to historical records; his taking with  him on his departure from the country four of the principal and most  virtuous youths of the city of Cholula to the sea where he separated  from them and sent back messages to his followers by them, promising  to return; [41] his prediction of other and white races to come and  occupy the western world and rule it; his mysterious departure from the  land, and his promise to return. All this, which so perfectly agrees  both with the character and ministry of Messiah among the Nephites,  as described in the Book of Mormon, is set forth in such clearness  that it cannot be discredited because of some evident fantasies and  incongruities in other parts of the traditions.

In fact all the Nephite kings seem  to have performed priestly functions; while under the Republic Alma  was made president of the state and high priest of the Church, (Mosiah  xxix: 42), and in the fifty-third year of the Republic Nephi, the son  of Helaman, was, for a time, both president of the Republic and high  priest of the Church. (Helaman iii: 37 and chapter iv.)    4. The Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl united in his own person  the character of king, priest and prophet. (Kingsborough, Vol. VI.,  p. 213). Prescott speaking of Montezuma says: \"He had been elected  to the regal dignity in preference to his brothers for his several  qualification both as a ruler and a priest, a combination of offices  sometimes found in the Mexican candidates, as it was, more frequently,  in the Egyptian.\" (Conquest of Mexico, Vol. I., p. 215). The same  author speaking of the Incas of Peru says: \"As the representative of  the sun he stood at the head of the priesthood and presided at the  most important of the religious festivals.\" (Conquest of Peru, Vol.  I., p. 41). In a note on this passage Mr. Prescott takes exception to  what he calls the \"sweeping assertion\" of Carli to the effect that  the royal and sacerdotal authority were blended together in Peru; yet  in another passage Prescott himself compares the ancient Peruvian  government with that of the Jews and says: \"The Inca was both the law  giver and the law. He was not merely the representative of divinity, or  like the pope, its vicegerant, but he was divinity itself.\" (Conquest  of Peru, Vol. I., p. 135). Tschudi emphatically states the union of  king and priest in the Incas as follows: \"Moreover, the monarchs of  Peru, as children of the sun, and descendants, in a direct line, from  Manco-Capac, were the high priests and oracles in religious matters.  Thus uniting the legislative and executive power, the supreme command  in war, absolute sovereignity in peace, and a venerated high priesthood  in religious feasts, they exercised the highest power ever known to  man--realized in their persons the famous union of the pope and the  emperor, and more reasonably than Louis XIV., might have exclaimed: \"I  am the state!\" (Peruvian Antiquities, Tschudi, pp. 74, 75).    5.
