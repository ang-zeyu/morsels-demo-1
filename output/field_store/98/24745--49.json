Sometimes a pair of polished horns would come poking between a calf and  the visitors, and a soft-eyed cow would view the proceedings with a  comically anxious face, and then it was easy to tell which calf was with  its mother.    In one of the largest stalls they saw the champion Guernsey of the  world. Her coat was like satin and her horns were polished until they  shone. She did not seem to be in the least set up on account of her  great reputation and thrust out her nose in the friendliest manner  possible to be patted and fussed over. She eyed Gladys, who stood next  to her, with amiable curiosity, and then suddenly licked her face. Mrs.  Evans watched Gladys in surprise. Instead of quivering all over with  disgust as she would have a year ago she simply laughed and patted the  cow's nose. \"What is going to happen?\" said Mrs. Evans to herself,  \"Gladys isn't afraid of cows any more!\" But the most interesting part  came when the cows were milked. They were driven into another barn for  this performance and their heads fastened into sort of metal hoops  suspended from the ceiling. These turned in either direction and caused  them no discomfort, but kept them standing in one place. The milking was  done with vacuum-suction machines run by electricity and took only a  short time.    When the girls had watched the process as long as they wished they were  taken to see the prize hogs and chickens, and then went through the hot  houses. There were rows and rows of glass houses filled with grapes, the  great bunches hanging down from the roof and threatening to fall with  their own weight. And one did fall, just as they were going through, and  came smashing down in the path at their feet. Nakwisi ran to pick it up  and the guide said she might have it, adding that such a bunch,  unbruised, sold for twenty-five cents in the city market. \"Oh, how  delicious!\" cried Nakwisi,' tasting the grapes and dividing them among  the girls. Mrs. Evans bought a basketful and let them eat all they  wanted. In some of the hothouses tangerines were growing, and in some  persimmons, while others were given over to the raising of roses,  carnations and rare orchids. It was a trip through fairyland for the  girls, and they could hardly tear themselves away when the time came.    \"There is something else I must show you while we are in the  neighborhood,\" said Mrs. Evans, as they passed through Akron. \"Does  anybody know what two historical things are near here?\" Nobody knew.  Mrs. Evans began humming, \"John Brown's Body Lies A-mouldering in the  Grave.\"    \"What has that to do with it?\" asked Gladys.    \"Everything, with one of them,\" said Mrs. Evans.    \"Did you know that John Brown, owner of the said body, was born in  Akron, and there is a monument here to his memory?\"    \"Oh how lovely,\" cried Migwan, \"let us see it.\" So Mrs. Evans drove them  over to the monument and they all stood around it and sang \"John Brown's  Body\" in his honor.    \"Now, what's the other thing?\" they asked.    \"I believe I know,\" said Nyoda. \"Doesn't the old Portage Trail run  through here somewhere?\"    \"That's it,\" said Mrs. Evans.    Then Nyoda told them about the Portage Path of Indian days, before the  canal was built, that extended from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. \"The  part that runs through Akron is still called Portage Path,\" said Mrs.  Evans, and the girls were eager to see it.    \"Why, it's nothing but a paved street!\" exclaimed Migwan in  disappointment, when they had reached the historical spot.    \"That's all it is now,\" answered Mrs. Evans, \"but it is built over the  old Portage Trail, and some of these old trees undoubtedly shaded the  original path.\" In the minds of the girls the handsome residences faded  from sight, and in place of the wide street they saw the narrow path  trailing off through the forest, with dusky forms stealing along it on  their long journey southward.    \"It's time to strike our own trail now,\" said Nyoda, breaking the  silence, and they started back to the river. Every one was anxious to  make it as pleasant as possible for Hinpoha, and the jests came thick  and fast as they drove along. \"Who is the best Latin scholar here?\"  asked Nyoda.    \"I am,\" said Sahwah, mischievously.    \"Then you can undoubtedly tell me what Caesar said on the Fourth of  July, 45 B.C.\" said Nyoda.    \"I don't seem to recollect,\" said Sahwah.    \"Then read for yourself,\" said Nyoda, scribbling a few words on a leaf  from her notebook and handing it to her.    \"What's this?\" said Sahwah, spelling out the words. On the paper was  written,    _Quis crudis enim rufus, albus et expiravit._    Sahwah tried to translate. \"_Quis,_ who; _crudis_, raw; _enim_--what's  _enim_?\"    \"For,\" answered Migwan.    \"And _expiravit_\" said Sahwah, \"what's that from?\"    \"_Expiro_\" answered Migwan, \"_expirare, expiravi, expiratus_. It means  'blow,' '_Expiravit_' is 'have blown.'\"    \"_Rufus_ is 'red,'\" continued Sahwah, \"and is _albus_ 'white'?\" Migwan  nodded, and Sahwah went back to the beginning and began to read: \"_Who  raw for red white and have blown._\"    Nyoda shouted. \"That last word is _blew_, not _have blown_\" she said.    \"I have it!\" cried Migwan, jumping up. \"It's '_Who raw for the red,  white and blew.' 'Hoorah for the red, white and blue!_'\"    \"Such wit!\" said Sahwah, laughing with the rest.    \"Now, I'll make a motto for Sahwah,\" said Migwan, seizing the pencil.  Migwan was a Senior and took French, and having a sudden inspiration,  she wrote, \"_Pas de lieu Rhone que nous!_\" The girls could not translate  it and Nyoda puzzled over it for a long time.    \"I don't seem to be able to make anything out of it,\" she said at  length.    \"Don't try to translate it,\" said Migwan, \"just read it out loud,\" Nyoda  complied and Sahwah caught it immediately.    \"It's '_Paddle your own canoe!_\" she cried.    Thus, laughing and joking, they followed the road back to the dam and  embarked in the launch with all speed, for the sun was already sinking  beneath the treetops and they had a two-hour ride ahead of them. Mrs.  Evans took Hinpoha back in the machine and delivered her to her aunt  safe and sound at eight o'clock, with many expressions of pleasure at  the fun she had had with the Camp Fire Girls, which were intended as  seeds to be planted in Aunt Phoebe's mind.    \"I think your mother's a perfect dear,\" said Sahwah to Gladys on the  trip home. \"I used to be frightened to death of her, because she always  looked so straight-laced and proper, but she isn't like that at all.  She's a regular Camp Fire Girl!\"          CHAPTER V.      A COASTING PARTY.    The memory of that happy day sustained Hinpoha through many of the  trials that came to her in the days that followed. It seemed that  everything she did brought down the wrath of her aunt in some way or  another. For instance, she left a bottle of bees standing on the table  in her room, and Aunt Phoebe's dog Silky, who had been in the habit of  going into the room and chewing Hinpoha's painted paddle, knocked the  bottle over and let the bees out, getting badly stung in the process.  Then there was a scene with Aunt Phoebe because she had brought the bees  in. This and a dozen more incidents of a similar nature made Hinpoha  despair of ever gaining the good will of her aunt. Thus the autumn wore  away to winter and as yet the Desert of Waiting had borne nothing but  thorns.    Gladys's progress through school was like the advance of a conquering  hero. Although she had just entered this fall she was already one of the  most popular girls in school. She had that fair, delicate prettiness  which invariably appeals to boys, and an open, unaffected manner which  endeared her to the girls. Beside her very lovable personality she had a  background which was almost certain to insure popularity to a girl. She  was rich and lived in a great house on a fashionable avenue; she had a  little electric car all her own, and she wore the smartest clothes of  any girl in school. Her fame as a dancer soon spread and she was in  constant demand at school entertainments. Nyoda watched her a trifle  anxiously at first. She was just a little afraid that Gladys's head  would be turned with all the homage paid her, or that, blinded by her  present success, she would lose the deeper meanings of life and be  nothing but a butterfly after all. But she need not have feared.  Gladys's experience in camp had kindled a fire in her that would never  be extinguished as long as life guarded the flame. Having changed her  Camp Fire name from Butterfly to Real Woman, she was anxious to prove  her right to the name. So she worked diligently to win new honors which  made her efficient in the home as well as those which helped her to  shine in society.    Mrs. Evans was returning from an afternoon card party. She was tired and  her head ached and she felt out of sorts. A remark which she had  overheard during the afternoon stayed in her mind and made her cross.  Two ladies on the other side of a large screen near which she was  sitting were discussing a campaign in which they were interested to  raise funds for a certain philanthropy. \"I am going to ask Mrs. Evans if  she would not like to subscribe one hundred dollars,\" said the one lady.    \"So much?\" asked the other in an uncertain voice, \"I don't believe I  would if I were you.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the first lady.    \"Haven't you heard,\" replied the second lady, with the air of imparting  a delicious secret, \"that Mr. Evans is on the verge of financial ruin?\"    \"No,\" replied the second in a tone of lively interest, \"I haven't. Who  told you so?\"    \"A great many people are saying so,\" continued the first. \"Do you know  that they took their daughter out of the private school she had been  attending and sent her to public school this year? They must be hard up  if they can't pay school bills any more.\"    \"It certainly looks like it,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#9)"],[1,"tle. On preparing the solution it  is well to set the bottles on the outside ledge of the window, or in some  other open situation where no inconvenience will result from the escape of  the excess of sulphurous gas as it bubbles through the water.    The solution of sulphurous acid, if preserved at all, ought to be kept in  small bottles, completely filled and perfectly closed; but as it is very  easy to saturate a considerable quantity of water with sulphurous acid gas  in a short time, there is but little inducement to use a solution which may  possibly have become weakened by keeping.    Care should be taken not to add too much dilute acid to the hypo at a time,  else excessive effervescence will occur, and the solution will froth over  the top of the bottle.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATIONAL MONUMENT AT ROME.      About three years ago the Italian Government invited the architects and  artists of the world to furnish competitive designs for a national monument  to be erected to the memory of King Victor Emanuel II. at Rome. More than  $1,800,000 were appropriated for the monument exclusive of the foundation.  It is very seldom that an artist has occasion to carry out as grand and  interesting a work as this was to be: the representation of the creator of  the Italian union in the new capitol of the new state surrounded by the  ruins and mementos of a proud and mighty past. Prizes of $10,000, $6,000,  and $4,000 were donated for the first, second, and third prize designs  respectively. Designs were entered, not only from Italy, but also from  Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, England, and America, and even from  Caucasus and Japan.    [Illustration: THE UNION OF ITALY. SACCONI'S PRIZE DESIGN FOR THE  NATIONAL MONUMENT, ROME, ITALY.]    The height and size of the monument were not determined on, nor was the  exact location, and the competitors had full liberty in relation to the  artistic character of the monument, and it was left for them to decide  whether it should be a triumphal arch, a column, a temple, a mausoleum, or  any other elaborate design. This great liberty given to the competitors was  of great value and service to the monument commission, as it enabled them  to decide readily what the character of the monument should be but it was a  dangerous point for the artists, at which most of them foundered. The  competition was resultless. Two prizes were given, but new designs had to  be called for, which were governed more or less by a certain programme  issued by the committee.    In place of the Piazza de Termini, a square extending from the church of  St. Maria degli Angeli to the new Via Nazionale, to which preference was  given by the competitors, the heights of Aracoeli were chosen. The monument  was to be erected at this historic place in front of the side wall of the  church, with the center toward the Corso, high above the surrounding  buildings. The programme called for an equestrian statue of the King  located in front of an architectural background which was to cover the old  church walls, and was to be reached by a grand staircase.    Even the result of this second competition was not definite, but as the  designers were guided by the programme, the results obtained were much more  satisfactory. The commission decided not to award the first prize, but  honored the Italian architects Giuseppi Sacconi and Manfredo Manfredi, and  the German Bruno Schmitz, with a prize of $2,000 each; and requested them  to enter into another competition and deliver their models within four  months, so as to enable the commission to come to a final decision. On June  18, the commission decided to accept Sacconi's design for execution, and  awarded a second prize of $2,000 to Manfredi.    Sacconi's design, shown opposite page, cut taken from the _Illustrirte  Zeitung_, needs but little explanation. An elegant gallery of sixteen  Corinthian columns on a high, prominent base is crowned by a high attica  and flanked by pavilions. It forms the architectural background for the  equestrian statue, and is reached by an elaborately ornamented staircase.    Manfredi's design shows a handsomely decorated wall in place of the  gallery, and in front of the wall an amphitheater is arranged, in the  center of which the equestrian statue is placed. Bruno Schmitz' design  shows a rich mosaic base supporting an Ionic portico, from the middle of  which a six column Corinthian \"pronaos\" projects, which no doubt would have  produced a magnificent effect in the streets of Rome.           *       *       *       *       *          ON THE EVOLUTION OF FORMS OF ORNAMENT.    [Footnote: From a paper by Prof. Jacobsthal in the _Transactions_ of the  Archaeological Society of Berlin.--_Nature_.]      The statement that modern culture can be understood only through a study of  all its stages of development is equally true of its several branches.    Let us assume that decorative art is one of these. It contains in itself,  like language and writing, elements of ancient and even of prehistoric  forms, but it must, like these other expressions of culture, which are  forever undergoing changes, adapt itself to the new demands which are made  upon it, not excepting the very arbitrary ones of fashion; and it is owing  to this cause that, sometimes even in the early stages of its development,  little or nothing of its original form is recognizable. Investigations the  object of which is to clear up this process of development as far as  possible are likely to be of some service; a person is more likely to  recognize the beauties in the details of ornamental works of art if he has  an acquaintance with the leading styles, and the artist who is freed from  the bondage of absolute tradition will be put into a better position to  discriminate between accidental and arbitrary and organic and legitimate  forms, and will thus have his work in the creation of new ones made more  easy for him.    Hence I venture to claim some measure of indulgence in communicating the  results of the following somewhat theoretical investigations, as they are  not altogether without a practical importance. I must ask the reader to  follow me into a modern drawing-room, not into one that will dazzle us with  its cold elegance, but into one whose comfort invites us to remain in it.    The simple stucco ceiling presents a central rosette, which passes over by  light conventional floral forms into the general pattern of the ceiling.  The frieze also, which is made of the same material, presents a similar but  somewhat more compact floral pattern as its chief motive. Neither of these,  though they belong to an old and never extinct species, has as yet attained  the dignity of a special name.    The walls are covered with a paper the ornamentation of which is based upon  the designs of the splendid textile fabrics of the middle ages, and  represents a floral pattern of spirals and climbing plants, and bears  evident traces of the influence of Eastern culture. It is called a  pomegranate or pine-apple pattern, although in this case neither  pomegranates nor pine-apples are recognizable.    Similarly with respect to the pattern of the coverings of the chairs and  sofas and of the stove-tiles; these, however, show the influence of Eastern  culture more distinctly.    The carpet also, which is not a true Oriental one, fails to rivet the  attention, but gives a quiet satisfaction to the eye, which, as it were,  casually glances over it, by its simple pattern, which is derived from  Persian-Indian archetypes (Cashmere pattern, Indian palmettas), and which  is ever rhythmically repeating itself (see Fig. 1).    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The floral pattern on the dressing-gown of the master of the house, as well  as on the light woolen shawl that is thrown round the shoulders of his  wife, and even the brightly colored glass knicknacks on the mantel-piece,  manufactured in Silesia after the Indian patterns of the Reuleaux  collection, again show the same motive; in the one case in the more  geometrical linear arrangement, in the other in the more freely entwined  spirals.    Now you will perhaps permit me to denominate these three groups of patterns  that occur in our new home fabrics as modern patterns. Whether we shall in  the next season be able, in the widest sense of the word, to call these  patterns modern naturally depends on the ruling fashion of the day, which  of course cannot be calculated upon (Fig. 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    I beg to be allowed to postpone the nearer definition of the forms that  occur in the three groups, which, however, on a closer examination all  present a good deal that they have in common. Taking them in a general way,  they all show a leaf-form inclosing an inflorescence in the form of an ear  or thistle; or at other times a fruit or a fruit-form. In the same way with  the stucco ornaments and the wall-paper pattern.    The Cashmere pattern also essentially consists of a leaf with its apex  laterally expanded; it closes an ear-shaped flower-stem, set with small  florets, which in exceptional cases protrude beyond the outline of the  leaf; the whole is treated rigorously as an absolute flat ornament, and  hence its recognition is rendered somewhat more difficult. The blank  expansion of the leaf is not quite unrelieved by ornament, but is set off  with small points, spots, and blossoms. This will be thought less strange  if we reflect on the Eastern representations of animals, in the portrayal  of which the flat expanses produced by the muscle-layers are often treated  from a purely decorative point of view, which strikes us as an exaggeration  of convention.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    One cannot go wrong in taking for granted that plant-forms were the  archetypes of all these patterns. Now we know that it holds good, as a  general principle in the history of civilization, that the tiller of the  ground"]]]
