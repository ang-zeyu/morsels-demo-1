Manual training has many origins; but in its now most widely accepted  form it came to us more than a generation ago from Moscow, and has its  best representation here in our new and often magnificent  manual-training high schools and in many courses in other public  schools. This work meets the growing demand of the country for a more  practical education, a demand which often greatly exceeds the  accommodations. The philosophy, if such it may be called, that  underlies the movement, is simple, forcible, and sound, and not unlike  Pestalozzi's \"_keine Kentnisse ohne Fertigkeiten_,\" [No knowledge  without skill] in that it lessens the interval between thinking and  doing; helps to give control, dexterity, and skill an industrial trend  to taste; interests many not successful in ordinary school; tends to  the better appreciation of good, honest work; imparts new zest for  some studies; adds somewhat to the average length of the school  period; gives a sense of capacity and effectiveness, and is a useful  preparation for a number of vocations. These claims are all well  founded, and this work is a valuable addition to the pedagogic  agencies of any country or state. As man excels the higher anthropoids  perhaps almost as much in hand power as in mind, and since the manual  areas of the brain are wide near the psychic zones, and the cortical  centers are thus directly developed, the hand is a potent instrument  in opening the intellect as well as in training sense and will. It is  no reproach to these schools that, full as they are, they provide for  but an insignificant fraction of the nearly sixteen millions or twenty  per cent of the young people of the country between fifteen and  twenty-four.    When we turn to the needs of these pupils, the errors and limitations  of the method are painful to contemplate. The work is essentially  manual and offers little for the legs, where most of the muscular  tissues of the body lie, those which respond most to training and are  now most in danger of degeneration at this age; the back and trunk  also are little trained. Consideration of proportion and bilateral  asymmetry are practically ignored. Almost in proportion as these  schools have multiplied, the rage for uniformity, together with  motives of economy and administrative efficiency on account of  overcrowding, have made them rigid and inflexible, on the principle  that as the line lengthens the stake must be strengthened. This is a  double misfortune; for the courses were not sufficiently considered at  first and the plastic stage of adaptation was too short, while the  methods of industry have undergone vast changes since they were given  shape. There are now between three and four hundred occupations in the  census, more than half of these involving manual work, so that never  perhaps was there so great a pedagogic problem as to make these  natural developments into conscious art, to extract what may be called  basal types. This requires an effort not without analogy to  Aristotle's attempt to extract from the topics of the marketplace the  underlying categories eternally conditioning all thought, or to  construct a grammar of speech. Hardly an attempt worthy the name, not  even the very inadequate one of a committee, has been made in this  field to study the conditions and to meet them. Like Froebel's gifts  and occupations, deemed by their author the very roots of human  occupations in infant form, the processes selected are underived and  find their justification rather in their logical sequence and  coherence than in being true norms of work. If these latter be  attainable at all, it is not likely that they will fit so snugly in a  brief curriculum, so that its simplicity is suspicious. The wards of  the keys that lock the secrets of nature and human life are more  intricate and mazy. As H.T. Bailey well puts it in substance, a master  in any art-craft must have a fourfold equipment: 1. Ability to grasp  an idea and embody it. 2. Power to utilize all nerve, and a wide  repertory of methods, devices, recipes, discoveries, machines, etc. 3.  Knowledge of the history of the craft. 4. Skill in technical  processes. American schools emphasize chiefly only the last.    The actual result is thus a course rich in details representing wood  and iron chiefly, and mostly ignoring other materials; the part of the  course treating of the former, wooden in its teachings and distinctly  tending to make joiners, carpenters, and cabinet-makers; that of the  latter, iron in its rigidity and an excellent school for smiths,  mechanics, and machinists. These courses are not liberal because they  hardly touch science, which is rapidly becoming the real basis of  every industry. Almost nothing that can be called scientific knowledge  is required or even much favored, save some geometrical and mechanical  drawing and its implicates. These schools instinctively fear and  repudiate plain and direct utility, or suspect its educational value  or repute in the community because of this strong bias toward a few  trades. This tendency also they even fear, less often because  unfortunately trade-unions in this country sometimes jealously suspect  it and might vote down supplies, than because the teachers in these  schools were generally trained in older scholastic and even classic  methods and matter. Industry is everywhere and always for the sake of  the product, and to cut loose from this as if it were a contamination  is a fatal mistake. To focus on process only, with no reference to the  object made, is here an almost tragic case of the sacrifice of content  to form, which in all history has been the chief stigma of  degeneration in education. Man is a tool-using animal; but tools are  always only a means to an end, the latter prompting even their  invention. Hence a course in tool manipulation only, with persistent  refusal to consider the product lest features of trade-schools be  introduced, has made most of our manual-training high schools ghastly,  hollow, artificial institutions. Instead of making in the lower grades  certain toys which are masterpieces of mechanical simplification, as  tops and kites, and introducing such processes as glass-making and  photography, and in higher grades making simple scientific apparatus  more generic than machines, to open the great principles of the  material universe, all is sacrificed to supernormalized method.    As in all hypermethodic schemes, the thought side is feeble. There is  no control of the work of these schools by the higher technical  institutions such as the college exercises over the high school, so  that few of them do work that fits for advanced training or is thought  best by technical faculties. In most of its current narrow forms,  manual training will prove to be historically, as it is educationally,  extemporized and tentative, and will soon be superseded by broader  methods and be forgotten and obsolete, or cited only as a low point of  departure from which future progress will loom up.    Indeed in more progressive centers, many new departures are now in the  experimental stage. Goetze at Leipzig, as a result of long and  original studies and trials, has developed courses in which pasteboard  work and modeling are made of equal rank with wood and iron, and he  has connected them even with the kindergarten below. In general the  whole industrial life of our day is being slowly explored in the quest  of new educational elements; and rubber, lead, glass, textiles,  metallurgical operations, agriculture, every tool and many machines,  etc., are sure to contribute their choicest pedagogical factors to the  final result. In every detail the prime consideration should be the  nature and needs of the youthful body and will at each age, their  hygiene and fullest development; and next, the closest connection with  science at every point should do the same for the intellect. Each  operation and each tool--the saw, knife, plane, screw, hammer, chisel,  draw-shave, sandpaper, lathe--will be studied with reference to its  orthopedic value, bilateral asymmetry, the muscles it develops, and  the attitudes and motor habits it favors; and uniformity, which in  France often requires classes to saw, strike, plane up, down, right,  left, all together, upon count and command, will give place to  individuality.
