Inside the hack Dismal Jones, most hideously bedaubed, was smoking a  cigarette and brandishing a wooden tomahawk at the same time, while he  sat astride of Bruce Browning, who was on the floor.    \"This is a sad and solemn occasion, paleface,\" croaked Dismal. \"You have  driven the noble red man from his ancestral halls, which were the dim  aisles of the mighty forests; you have pushed him across the plains, and  you have tried to crowd him off the earth into the Pacific Ocean. Ugh!  You have pursued him with deadly firearms and still more deadly fire  water. You have been relentless in your hatred and your greed. You have  even been so unreasonable that whenever a poor red man has secured a few  paleface scalps as trophies to hang in his wigwam you have taken your  trusty rifles and gone forth with great fury and shot the poor Indian  full of hard bullets. You have done heap many things that you would not  have done if you had not done so. But now, poor, shivering dog of a  paleface, the injured red man has arisen at last in his might. If we are  to perish, we are to perish; but before we perish, we will enjoy the  gentle pleasure of roasting a few white men at the stake. Ugh! We have  held a council of war, we have excavated the hatchet, we have smashed  the pipe of peace to flinders, or something of the sort, and have struck  out upon the war trail.\"    \"You act as if you had struck out,\" growled one of the captives.    \"That's because he has had a few balls,\" gurgled Browning. \"Talk about  being burned at the stake! That's not torture after being obliged to  inhale his breath. My kingdom for some chloroform! Will somebody please  hit me on the head with a trip hammer and put me out of my misery?\"    \"Whither art thou bearing us, great chief?\" asked one of the captives.    \"We will bare you out yonder,\" answered Dismal. \"At the stake you shall  stand arrayed in the garments nature provided for you.\"    \"I don't care for tea,\" murmured Browning--\"not even for repartee.\"    \"This is worse than being roasted at the stake!\" muttered a soph in a  corner. \"It is severe punishment.\"    \"Help!\" cried Dismal. \"Somebody take me out! I can't get ahead of these  miserable palefaces.\"    \"You'll get a head if I ever find a good chance to give it to you,\"  declared the voice of Puss Parker from the darkness.    Outside the painted savages were roaring:      \"Farewell! farewell! farewell, my fairy fay!      Oh, I'm off to Louisiana      For to see my Susy Anna,    Singing 'Polly-wolly-woodle' all the day.\"    And thus the captured sophomores were borne in triumph out to East Rock,  and as they were the ones who engaged the hack, they paid for their own  conveyance.    Never before had anything like it happened at Yale. It was an event that  was bound to go down in history as the most audacious and daring piece  of work ever successfully carried through by freshmen in that college.    And Frank Merriwell was to receive the credit of being the originator of  the scheme and the general who carried it out successfully.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE \"ROAST\" AT EAST ROCK.      A strange and remarkable scene was being enacted in the peaceable and  civilized State of Connecticut--a scene which must have startled an  accidental observer and caused him to fancy for a moment the hand of  time had turned back two centuries.    Near a bright fire that was burning on the ground squatted a band of  hideously-painted fellows who seemed to be redskins, while close at  hand, bound and helpless, were a number of palefaces, plainly the  captives of the savages.    That a council of war was taking place seemed apparent. And still the  savages seemed waiting for something.    At length, out of the darkness advanced a tall, well-built warrior, the  trailing plumes of whose war bonnet reached quite to the ground. If  anything, this fellow was more hideously painted than any of the others,  and there was an air of distinction about him that proclaimed him a  great chief.    \"Ugh!\" he grunted. \"I am here.\"    The savages arose, and one of them said:    \"Fellow warriors, the mighty chief Fale-in-his-Hoce--I mean  Hole-in-his-Face--has arrived.\"    Then a wild yell of greeting went up to the twinkling stars, and every  savage brandished a tomahawk, scalping knife, or some other kind of  weapon.    \"Brothers,\" said Hole-in-his-Face, \"I see that I am welcome in your  midst, as any up-to-date country newspaper reporter would say. You have  received me with great _eclat_--excuse my French; I was educated  abroad--in New Jersey.\"    \"Go back to Princeton!\" cried one of the captives.    \"Fellow warriors,\" continued Hole-in-his-Face, without noticing the  interruption, \"I am heap much proud to be with you on this momentous  occasion.\"    \"Yah! yah! yah!\" yelled the savages.    \"And now,\" the chief went on, \"if you will proceed to squat on your  haunches I will orate a trifle.\"    Once more the redskins sat down on the ground, and then the late arrival  struck an attitude and began his oration:    \"Warriors of my people, why are we assembled together to-night?\"    \"Because we couldn't assemble apart,\" murmured a voice.    \"We are assembled to avenge our wrongs upon the hated paleface,\" the  chief declared. \"It was long ago that the proud and haughty paleface got  the bulge on the red man, and we have not been in the game to any great  extent since then. Every time we have held two pairs he has come in with  one pair of sixes or a Winchester and raked the pot. He has not given us  any kind of a show for our white alley. Whenever we seemed to be getting  along fairly well and doing a little something, he has wrung in a cold  deck on us and then shot us full of air holes, purely for the purpose of  ventilation in case we objected. Warriors, we have grown tired of being  soaked in the neck.\"    \"That's right,\" nodded a savage, \"unless we are soaked in the neck with  fire water.\"    \"At last,\" shouted the orator--\"at last we have arisen in our wrath and  our war paint and we are out for scalps. We have decided that the joy of  the red man is fleeting. To-night a flush mantles your dark cheeks, but  to-morrow it will be a bobtail flush. What have we to live for but  vengeance on the white man and a little booze now and then? Nothing! Our  squaws once were beautiful as the wild flowers of the prairie, but now  the prize beauty of our tribe is Malt Extract Maria, whose nose is out  of joint, whose eyes are skewed, whose teeth are covered with fine-cut  tobacco, and who lost one of her ears last week by accidentally getting  it into the mouth of her husband.    \"My brothers, we are not built to weep. It is not the way of the noble  red man. A few more summers and we will be no more. We will have kicked  the stuffing out of the bucket and wended our way up the golden stair.  But before we cough up the ghost it behooves us to strike one last blow  at the hated paleface. When we get a chance at a paleface it is our duty  to do him, and do him bad. Are you on?    \"We have been successful in capturing a few of our hated foes, and they  are bound and helpless near at hand. Shall they be fricasseed, broiled,  fried, or made into a potpie? That is the question before the meeting,  and I am ready to listen to others. Let us hear from Squint-eyed  Sausageface.\"    \"It doesn't make a dit of bifference--I mean a bit of difference to me  how I have my paleface cooked,\" said the one indicated as Squint-eyed  Sausageface. \"Perhaps it would be well enough to cook them at the  stake.\"    \"I think that would be the proper mode,\" gravely declared another  warrior; \"for I have heard that they boast they are hot stuff. They  should not boast in vain.\"    \"Warriors,\" said Hole-in-his-Face, \"you have heard. What have you to  say?\"    \"So mote it be,\" came solemnly from one.    \"Yah! yah! yah!\" yelled the others.    \"That settles it, as the sugar remarked to the egg dropped into the  coffee. Prepare the torture stakes.\"    There was a great bustle, and in a short time the stakes were prepared  and driven into the ground, one of the savages hammering them down with  a huge stick of wood.    Then the captives were bound to the stakes and a lot of brush was  brought and piled about their feet.    Some of the sophs actually looked scared, but Browning kept up a  continual fire of sarcastic remarks.    \"Ugh!\" grunted Hole-in-his-Face. \"This paleface talks heap much. Remove  his outer garments, so the fire may reach his flesh without delay.\"    Then Browning was held and his clothes were stripped off till he stood  in his under garments, barefooted, bareheaded, and still defiant.    \"Oh, say!\" he muttered, \"won't there be an awful hour of reckoning!  Merriwell will regret the day he came to Yale!\"    At this Hole-in-his-Face laughed heartily, and Browning cried:    \"Oh, I know you, Merriwell! You can't fool me, though you have got the  best makeup of them all.\"    When everything was ready, one of the savages actually touched a match  to the various piles of brush about the feet of the unfortunate  sophomores.    As the tiny flames leaped up the painted band joined in a wild war dance  about the stakes, flourishing their weapons and whooping as if they were  real Indians. Some of their postures and steps were exact imitations of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1112"],[0,"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet (#9)"],[1,"art taken. Hence, be gone, away!      Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!      Ben. Why dost thou stay?                                                       Exit Romeo.                        Enter Citizens.        Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?      Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?      Ben. There lies that Tybalt.      Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.      I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.        Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,                       and [others].        Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?      Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all      The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.      There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,      That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.      Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!      O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd      Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,      For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.      O cousin, cousin!      Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?      Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.      Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink      How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal      Your high displeasure. All this- uttered      With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-      Could not take truce with the unruly spleen      Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts      With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;      Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,      And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats      Cold death aside and with the other sends      It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity      Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,      'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,      His agile arm beats down their fatal points,      And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm      An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life      Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;      But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,      Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,      And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I      Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;      And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.      This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.      Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;      Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.      Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,      And all those twenty could but kill one life.      I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.      Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.      Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.      Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?      Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;      His fault concludes but what the law should end,      The life of Tybalt.      Prince. And for that offence      Immediately we do exile him hence.      I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,      My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;      But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine      That you shall all repent the loss of mine.      I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;      Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.      Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,      Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.      Bear hence this body, and attend our will.      Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.                                                           Exeunt.          Scene II.  Capulet's orchard.    Enter Juliet alone.        Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,      Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner      As Phaeton would whip you to the West      And bring in cloudy night immediately.      Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,      That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo      Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.      Lovers can see to do their amorous rites      By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,      It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,      Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,      And learn me how to lose a winning match,      Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.      Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,      With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,      Think true love acted simple modesty.      Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;      For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night      Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.      Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;      Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,      Take him and cut him out in little stars,      And he will make the face of heaven so fine      That all the world will be in love with night      And pay no worship to the garish sun.      O, I have bought the mansion of a love,      But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,      Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day      As is the night before some festival      To an impatient child that hath new robes      And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,                    Enter Nurse, with cords.        And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks      But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.      Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords      That Romeo bid thee fetch?      Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.                                               [Throws them down.]      Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands      Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!      We are undone, lady, we are undone!      Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!      Jul. Can heaven be so envious?      Nurse. Romeo can,      Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!      Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!      Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?      This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.      Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'      And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more      Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.      I am not I, if there be such an 'I';      Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'      If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'      Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.      Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,      (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.      A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;      Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,      All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.      Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!      To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!      Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,      And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!      Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!      O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman      That ever I should live to see thee dead!      Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?      Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?      My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?      Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!      For who is living, if those two are gone?      Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;      Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.      Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?      Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!      Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!      Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?      Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!      Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!      Despised substance of divinest show!      Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-      A damned saint, an honourable villain!      O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell      When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend      In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?      Was ever book containing such vile matter      So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell      In such a gorgeous palace!      Nurse. There's no trust,      No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,      All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.      Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.      These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.      Shame come to Romeo!      Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue      For such a wish! He was not born to shame.      Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;      For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd      Sole monarch of the universal earth.      O, what a beast was I to chide at him!      Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?      Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?      Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name      When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?      But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?      That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.      Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!      Your tributary drops belong to woe,      Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.      My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;      And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.      All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?      Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,      That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;      But O, it presses to my memory      Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!      'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'      That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'      Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death      Was woe enough, if it had ended there;      Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship      And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,      Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'      Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,      Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?      But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,      'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word      Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,      All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-      There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,      In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.      Where is my father and my mother, nurse?      Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.      Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.      Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be"]]]
