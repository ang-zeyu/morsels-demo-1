The last streak of light had faded from the west, and a pale lustre  kindling in the eastern portions of the sky, became brighter and brighter  till the white falcated moon was lifted up above the horizon; while  uncountable stars appeared to reflect their brilliancy in the waters  below. This delightful scene around us, so perfectly filled and satisfied  our sense of beauty that we reluctantly gave up our comfortable seats on  the stern-deck, notwithstanding an advanced time of night.    On the following morning the sun rose in his clearest splendor. As soon as  that flood of luminous rays which constitutes day, was flowing on the  crystalline sea, we departed from this romantic country scene in Canada.    Sailing along, we approached the terminus of our voyage on Lake Erie,  which is considered the most dangerous of all the Great Lakes as to  navigation, owing to its comparative shallowness--its mean depth, being  about ninety feet--and the consequent liability to a heavy ground swell.  The peculiar features of this body of water are its inferior depth and the  clayey nature of its shores, which are generally low; on the south,  however, bordered by an elevated plateau, through which the rivers have  cut deep channels.    Though the lake possesses but a small number of good harbors, the amount  of traffic on its waters, and on the connecting railways is enormous.    This inland-sea, presenting us only sights of utmost quietude and peace,  has been the scene of a naval engagement between the British and  Americans, September 10, 1813, in which the latter were victorious. The  view we enjoyed was not in the least adequate to remind us of warfare; on  the contrary        \"The sun in heaven shone so gay:       All things were joyful on that day.\"    It was yet early in the morning when we neared the city of Detroit, having  almost reached the head of _Detroit River_ which separates the United  States from Canada. Being about one-half to three-quarters of a mile wide,  and five and one-half fathoms deep, the river flows with a pretty swift  current.    _Detroit_ is the most important city of Michigan, opposite the Canadian  town Windsor.    Eighteen miles north of Lake Erie, it stretches with its suburbs about  five miles along the river, and the central part extends for about two  miles back from the shore. Approaching the city, we were more and more  delighted with its attractive appearance. The streets, from fifty to 100  feet wide, are for the most part ornamented with rows of trees. A number  of avenues, having an unusual width, diverge from the Grand Circus, a  spacious park semi-circular in form, which is divided into two quadrants  by Woodward Avenue. Connected with the former is the Campus Martius, a  public place about 600 feet long and 250 feet wide. Detroit comprises many  magnificent structures. One of the chief public buildings is the city  hall, facing the Campus Martius, with fronts on four streets. It counts  among the finest edifices of the kind in the west. Built of sandstone, it  is designed after the Italian style of architecture, surmounted by a tower  180 feet high. Its cost amounted to $600,000. Other prominent structures  are the opera house, the office of the Board of Trade, the custom house,  and the Roman Catholic cathedral.    The commercial facilities of the city are very extensive. The Detroit  River is a connecting link in the great chain of lake navigation, and  affords the best harbor on the inland-seas. Detroit is not only the center  of a great railroad system; more than 350 vessels are owned here, and  numerous daily lines of steamers run to various points of the lakes. Its  manufacturing industries are very important and consist of iron, flour,  tobacco, cigars, lumber, and bricks. The extensive Pullman Car Works are  situated here; also one of the seven pin factories in the United States.    Settled by the French, early in the eighteenth century, Detroit passed  into the hands of the English in 1763. It was then besieged for eleven  months by the Indian chief Pontiac; ceded to the Americans in 1783, but  not occupied by them till 1796. As a city, it was incorporated in 1824;  and its present population is estimated to be 235,000. It was the capital  of Michigan from 1837 till 1847, when that honor was transferred to  Lansing.    Having traversed Detroit River, we entered _Lake St. Clair_, a sheet of  water eighteen miles long and twenty-two miles wide. This small lake has  many extensive sand-banks covered with a depth of water varying from six  to ten feet. Previous to 1858, much inconvenience was experienced in  navigating it, owing to the insufficient depth, but the governments of the  United States and Canada have dredged a canal through the bed of the lake,  comprising a width of 300 feet. Since then, this channel has been deepened  so as to enable vessels drawing fifteen feet to pass with safety from lake  to lake in stormy weather.    After the expiration of a few hours we reached _River St. Clair_, whose  luxuriant border exhibited a magnificent panorama.    Afar off westward, the uplands wore a tinge of tenderest blue; and in the  nearer distance, on the low shores of the river, superb summer residences,  tasty villas, and elegant hotels, built in every style of architecture,  lay interspersed between romantic hills and tufted groves. The horizon was  of a fine, golden tint, changing gradually into the deep blue of the  mid-heaven.    None of us ventured to leave the deck fearing to miss some of those  unrivaled sights constantly offering new attractions.    This trip on River St. Clair--though having an extent of thirty-three  miles--seemed but short to us; and the fine spectacle displayed on the  charming western bank may be reckoned among the most delightful scenes we  beheld on our long, enjoyable voyage.    As we approached the terminus of the river, a sudden rush of the awakened  wind was heard; and out of the blue horizon a troop of narrow, dark, and  pointed clouds were advancing, covering the sky, inch by inch, with their  gray masses gradually blotting the light out of the landscape. Horizontal  bars of black shadow were forming under them, and lurid wreaths wrapped  themselves about the crests of the hills. The wind had grown more violent  as _Port Huron_ came in view. Waving curtains of opaque rain, swinging  from the overburdened clouds, dropped down upon the surface of the river.  The black swaying fringes, sweeping irresistibly along the water, churned  the surface into foam.    The sudden and unfavorable change of the weather determined our commodore  to abide at _Port Huron_, a prosperous city in Michigan. It commands a  very advantageous situation, located on the west bank of River St. Clair,  and at the southern extremity of Lake Huron.    Being the county seat of St. Clair County, it is also a point of great  importance in the railway system, and the terminus of several lines of  lake steamers.    The city, with a population of nearly 14,000, has a large lumber trade,  ship-yards, dry-docks, saw and flour mills.    Founded in 1819, Port Huron was incorporated as a village in 1835, and as  a city in 1857.    Since the yacht lingered here until Monday, August 7th, we were enabled to  become familiar with its broad streets, regularly laid out and well  shaded; some adorned by beautiful private residences. The heavy, black  clouds that had shrouded the whole sky ever since we made our entry in  Port Huron, were yet concealing the golden disk of the summer sun. The  atmosphere, however, which had previously a disagreeable, wet chilliness  in it, gradually grew clearer and warmer so that we left the dock with the  intention to undertake our voyage on Lake Huron, but when nearing the  place where this sheet of water, covering an area of 23,000 square miles,  communicates with River St. Clair, we discovered that the swell on the  lake level was yet quite considerable, whereas the wind which had blown a  gale all the preceding day, was gradually dying away.    Still, we found it advisable to wait until the foaming waves of the  enraged element had been appeased. In consequence of this decision we  concluded to moor the yacht as near the entrance of Lake Huron, as we  conveniently could, ready for an early departure; for which we considered  the town of _Sarnia_, opposite Port Huron, the most favorable locality.    Romantically situated on the Canadian shore, Sarnia affords a splendid  north and west view. Its handsome streets and neat structures are quite  attractive to the stranger; and not these alone but also the residents who  are generous and hospitable. We observed this fact, even during our short  stay, when receiving the visit of Mr. Clark and his amiable lady, who  presented us with a bouquet of fragrant flowers, a kind gift that we  highly appreciated.    Long ere the east became purple with the morning light and the pinnacles  of Sarnia were bathed, one by one, in the glory of its burning, we  departed from the pleasant city, and the white sea-bird \"Marguerite\"  spread her light wings over the surface of Lake Huron, whose  waves--although the wind was quite fresh--did not run as high as I  anticipated; for I had been informed that on the previous day the tide  from the lake into Detroit River amounted to eight miles an hour.    As I was pacing up and down the deck, I viewed an inland-sea 270 miles  long, and 105 miles broad, with a picturesque coast line on our left. The  purity of its waters was discernible by its limpid appearance and savory  taste. The fine deposits of sand and clay extending at different places  along the shore to a distance of twenty miles inland, by their contrasts  added to the scenic beauty, exhibiting a variety of magnificent views.    The luxuriant coast bordering on the southern extremity of the lake and  skirting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],[0,"Legends of the Gods (#8)"],[1,"surnamed \"Pa-ari-sekher,\"  i.e., the \"Worker of destinies,\" who was able to repel the attacks of  evil spirits and to drive them out.  When the statues of the two gods  were facing each other, Rameses II. entreated Khensu Nefer-hetep to  \"turn his face towards,\" i.e., to look favourably upon Khensu.  Pa-ari-  sekher, and to let him go to Bekhten to drive the devil out of the  Princess of Bekhten.  The text affords no explanation of the fact that  Khensu Nefer-hetep was regarded as a greater god than Khensu Pa-ari-  sekher, or why his permission had to be obtained before the latter  could leave the country.  It is probable that the demands made upon  Khensu Nefer-hetep by the Egyptians who lived in Thebes and its  neighbourhood were so numerous that it was impossible to let his statue  go into outlying districts or foreign lands, and that a deputy-god was  appointed to perform miracles outside Thebes.  This arrangement would  benefit the people, and would, moreover, bring much money to the  priests.  The appointment of a deputy-god is not so strange as it may  seem, and modern African peoples are familiar with the expedient.  About one hundred years ago the priests of the god Bobowissi of  Winnebah, in the Tshi region of West Africa, found their business so  large that it was absolutely necessary for them to appoint a deputy.  The priests therefore selected Brahfo, i.e., \"deputy,\" and gave out  that Bobowissi had deputed all minor matters to him, and that his  utterances were to be regarded as those of Bobowissi.  Delegates were  ordered to be sent to Winnebah in Ashanti, where they would be shown  the \"deputy\" god by the priests, and afterwards he would be taken to  Mankassim, where he would reside, and do for the people all that  Bobowissi had done hitherto.[FN#39]        [FN#39]  Ellis, Tshi-speaking Peoples, p. 55.        When Rameses II. had made his petition to Khensu Nefer-hetep, the  statue of the god bowed its head twice, in token of assent.  Here it is  clear that we have an example of the use of statues with movable limbs,  which were worked, when occasion required, by the priests.  The king  then made a second petition to the god to transfer his sa, or magical  power, to Khensu Pa-ari-sekher so that when he had arrived in Bekhten  he would be able to heal the Princess.  Again the statue of Khensu  Nefer-hetep bowed its head twice, and the petition of the king was  granted.  The text goes on to say that the magical power of the greater  god was transferred to the lesser god four times, or in a fourfold  measure, but we are not told how this was effected.  We know from many  passages in the texts that every god was believed to possess this  magical power, which is called the \"sa of life,\" or the \"sa of the  god,\".[FN#40]  This sa could be transferred by a god or goddess to a  human being, either by an embrace or through some offering which was  eaten.  Thus Temu transferred the magical power of his life to Shu and  Tefnut by embracing them,[FN#41] and in the Ritual of the Divine  Cult[FN#42] the priest says, The two vessels of milk of Temu are the \"sa  of my limbs.\"  The man who possessed this sa could transfer it to his  friend by embracing him and then \"making passes\" with his hands along  his back.  The sa could be received by a man from a god and then  transmitted by him to a statue by taking it in his arms, and this  ceremony was actually performed by the king in the Ritual of the Divine  Cult.[FN#43]  The primary source of this sa was Ra, who bestowed it  without measure on the blessed dead,[FN#44] and caused them to live for  ever thereby.  These, facts make it tolerably certain that the magical  power of Khensu Nefer-hetep was transferred to Khensu Pa-ari-sekher in  one of two ways: either the statue of the latter was brought near to  that of the former and it received the sa by contact, or the high  priest first received the sa from the greater god and then transmitted  it to the lesser god by embraces and \"passes\" with his hands.  Be this  as it may, Khensu Pa-ari-sekher received the magical power, and having  been placed in his boat, he set out for Bekhten, accompanied by five  smaller boats, and chariots and horses which marched on each side of  him.        [FN#40]  Text of Unas, line 562.    [FN#41]  Pyramid Texts, Pepi I., l. 466.    [FN#42]  Ed. Moret, p. 21.    [FN#43]  Ibid., p. 99.    [FN#44]  Pepi I., line 666.        When after a journey of seventeen months Khensu Pa-ari-sekher arrived  in Bekhten, he was cordially welcomed by the Prince, and, having gone  to the place where the Princess who was possessed of a devil lived, he  exercised his power to such purpose that she was healed immediately.  Moreover, the devil which had been cast out admitted that Khensu Pa-  ari-sekher was his master, and promised that he would depart to the  place whence he came, provided that the Prince of Bekhten would  celebrate a festival in his honour before his departure. Meanwhile  the Prince and his soldiers stood by listening to the conversation  between the god and the devil, and they were very much afraid.  Following the instructions of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher the Prince made  a great feast in honour of the supernatural visitors, and then the  devil departed to the \"place which he loved,\" and there was general  rejoicing in the land.  The Prince of Bekhten was so pleased with the  Egyptian god that he determined not to allow him to return to Egypt.  When the statue of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher had been in Bekhten for three  years and nine months, the Prince in a vision saw the god, in the form  of a golden hawk, come forth from his shrine, and fly up into the air  and direct his course to Egypt.  Realizing that the statue of the god  was useless without its indwelling spirit, the Prince of Bekhten  permitted the priests of Khensu Pa-ari-sekher to depart with it to  Egypt, and dismissed them with gifts of all kinds.  In due course they  arrived in Egypt and the priests took their statue to the temple of  Khensu Nefer-hetep, and handed over to that god all the gifts which the  Prince of Bekhten had given them, keeping back nothing for their own  god.  After this Khensu Pa-ari-sekher returned to his temple in peace,  in the thirty-third year of the reign of Rameses II., having been  absent from it about eight years.            VII.        A LEGEND OF KHNEMU AND OF A SEVEN YEARS' FAMINE.        The text of this most interesting legend is found in hieroglyphics on  one side of a large rounded block of granite some eight or nine feet  high, which stands on the south-east portion of Sahal, a little island  lying in the First Cataract, two or three miles to the south of  Elephantine Island and the modern town of Aswan.  The inscription is  not cut into the rock in the ordinary way, but was \"stunned\" on it with  a blunted chisel, and is, in some lights, quite invisible to anyone  standing near the rock, unless he is aware of its existence.  It is in  full view of the river-path which leads from Mahallah to Philae, and  yet it escaped the notice of scores of travellers who have searched the  rocks and islands in the Cataract for graffiti and inscriptions.  The  inscription, which covers a space six feet by five feet, was discovered  accidentally on February 6th, 1889, by the late Mr. C. E. Wilbour, a  distinguished American gentleman who spent many years in research in  Egypt.  He first copied the text, discovering in the course of his work  the remarkable nature of its contents and then his friend Mr. Maudslay  photographed it.  The following year he sent prints from Mr. Maudslay's  negatives to Dr. Brugsch, who in the course of 1891 published a  transcript of the text with a German translation and notes in a work  entitled Die biblischen sieben Jahre der Hungersnoth, Leipzig, 8vo.    The legend contained in this remarkable text describes a terrible  famine which took place in the reign of Tcheser, a king of the IIIrd  Dynasty, and lasted for seven years.  Insufficient Nile-floods were, of  course, the physical cause of the famine, but the legend shows that the  \"low Niles\" were brought about by the neglect of the Egyptians in  respect of the worship of the god of the First Cataract, the great god  Khnemu.  When, according to the legend, king Tcheser had been made to  believe that the famine took place because men had ceased to worship  Khnemu in a manner appropriate to his greatness, and when he had taken  steps to remove the ground of complaint, the Nile rose to its  accustomed height, the crops became abundant once more, and all misery  caused by scarcity of provisions ceased.  In other words, when Tcheser  restored the offerings of Khnemu, and re-endowed his sanctuary and his  priesthood, the god allowed Hapi to pour forth his streams from the  caverns in the Cataract, and to flood the land with abundance.  The  general character of the legend, as we have it here, makes it quite  certain that it belongs to a late period, and the forms of the  hieroglyphics and the spellings of the words indicate that the text was  \"stunned\" on the rock in the reign of one of the Ptolemies, probably at  a time when it was to the interest of some men to restore the worship  of Khnemu, god of the First Cataract.  These interested people could  only have been the priests of Khnemu, and the probability that this was  so becomes almost a certainty when we read in the latter part of the  text the list of the tolls and taxes which they were empowered to levy  on the merchants, farmers, miners, etc., whose goods passed down the  Cataract into Egypt.  Why, if this be the case, they should have chosen  to connect the famine with the reign of Tcheser is not clear.  They may  have wished to prove the great antiquity of the worship of Khnemu, but  it would have been quite easy to select the name of some king of the  Ist Dynasty, and had they done this, they would have made the authority  of Khnemu over the Nile coaeval with Dynastic"]]]
