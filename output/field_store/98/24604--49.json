The roar drummed and beat and shook the boat, then died away as  suddenly as it came; a moment later there was a severe jar. We had  struck the bottom, still maintaining our angle.    I painfully got to my feet and then discovered from the navigator that  he had suddenly seen two white patches of foam 800 yards on the  starboard bow, which resolved themselves into the bow waves of a  destroyer approaching at full speed to ram.    We had dived just in time, and her knife-edged bow, driven by 30,000  horse power, had slid through the water a very few feet above our  conning tower.    Luckily he had not dropped any depth charges. We were not, however,  completely free of our troubles, though we had cheated the destroyer.    Examination of the chart, showed the bottom to be mud, and on  attempting to move the foremost hydroplanes, the plane motor fuses blew  out. This showed that the boat was buried in the mud right up to her  foremost planes, which were immovable.    The hydrophone watchkeeper reported that he could still hear  fast-running propellers, though probably some distance away, and as  this showed that our old enemy was still nosing about we were very  anxious not to break surface. We just blew \"A.\" [1] At least we started  to blow \"A,\" but Alten wisely decided that, as it was a calm night with  a half-moon, the bubbles on the surface might be rather conspicuous, so  we stopped the blow and put the pump on. We also flooded \"W\". [2] This  had no effect on her at all.    [Footnote 1: Probably their foremost internal tank.--ETIENNE.]    [Footnote 2: Presumably their after internal tank.--ETIENNE.]    We then pumped out \"Q\" and \"P,\" leaving \"W\" full, and adjusted our trim  to give her only three tons negative buoyancy, just enough to keep us  on the bottom if she came out of the mud.    In this position we went full speed astern on the motors, 1,500 amps on  each, and all the crew in the after-compartment. No result. We then  pumped the outer diving tanks on the port side to give her a list to  starboard. Still she remained fixed.    So at 2 a.m. we decided to risk it and we put a slow blow on all tanks.    When she had about fifty tons positive buoyancy she suddenly bucketed  up, and, as the motors were running full speed astern at the time, we  came up and broke surface stern first. In a few seconds we were trimmed  down again, and as a precautionary measure we proceeded for a couple of  miles at twenty metres, when, coming up to periscope depth, we  surfaced, and finding all clear we proceeded. We were put down by a  trawler at dawn, though she never saw us. After half an hour's hanging  about she moved off, which was lucky, as she was right on our billet.    We are now proceeding to a spot somewhat to the eastward of Cape St.  Abbs, [3] as we have instructions to do a two-days patrol here and sink  shipping.    [Footnote 3: St. Abbs Head.--ETIENNE]    We ought to start business to-morrow morning.           *       *       *       *       *    We should be in to-night, then for my little Zoe!    But I must record what we have done. Already I am getting much pleasure  from reading my diary. Strange how it amuses one to see little bits of  oneself on paper, and the less garnished and franker the truths the  more entertaining it is.    [Illustration: \"The torpedo had jumped clean out of the water a hundred  yards short of the steamer and had then dived under her.\"]    [Illustration: \"We were put down by a trawler at dawn.\"]    [Illustration: A moment later there was a severe jar; we had struck  the bottom]    The hours here are so long and boring at times that I feel I want to  talk intimately with someone. Failing Zoe I turn to my notebooks.    The first steamer we sighted raised high hopes, at least her smoke did,  for we saw enough smoke on the horizon to make us think we were to see  the Grand Fleet, and we promptly dived. We cruised towards her for  about half an hour, and then hung about where we were, as we found that  her course would take the ship close to us.    As the situation developed, Alten, who was up in the conning tower at  the \"A\" periscope, gave us a certain amount of information, and we  gathered that all this smoke was pouring out of the pipe-stem tunnel of  a wretched little English tramp.    I found it most irritating, standing in the control room (my action  station) and not knowing what was going on.    There is only one good job in a submarine and that is the Captain's. He  knows and decides everything. The rest of us are in his hands and take  things on trust. I object on principle to my life being held in Alten's  hands. It is all very well for the crew, for, to start with, they have  no imagination, and to most of them their mental horizon stops at the  walls of the boat. Secondly, they have the consolation of mechanical  activities; they make and break switches and open and close  valves--they work with their hands. An officer has imagination, and  only works with his head.    As we attacked the steamer, all one heard was murmurs from Alten, such  as: \"Raise!\" \"Lower!\" \"Take her down to ten metres!\" \"Half speed!\"  \"Slow!\" \"Bring her up to five metres!\" \"Raise!\" \"Lower!\"    I endeavoured to simulate an air of unconcern which I was far from  feeling.    Not that I was a prey to physical fear; I flatter myself it is so far  unknown to me, and there was no great danger, but simply that I longed  to know what was happening. At length I heard the welcome order:    \"Starboard tube. Stand by!\"    Which was followed almost immediately by the order: \"Fire!\"    There was a kind of coughing grunt, and the starboard torpedo proceeded  on its errand of destruction.    Every ear was strained for the sound of the explosion, but all we were  vouchsafed was a torrent of blasphemy from Alten.    The torpedo had jumped clean out of the water a hundred yards short of  the steamer, and had then evidently dived under the ship; so I gathered  later when Alten had calmed down somewhat. We were about to surface and  give her the gun, when luckily Alten took a good sweep round with the  skyscraper and discovered one of those wretched little airships about a  mile away, coming towards the steamer, which was wailing piteously, on  her syren.    As the chart showed forty metres we decided to bottom and have lunch.    Over lunch we discussed the misadventure. Alten was loud in his curses  of Tanzerman (the torpedo lieutenant at Bruges), from whom he had got  the torpedo in guaranteed good condition only forty-eight hours before  we sailed. He launched forth into a tirade against the torpedo staff at  Bruges, and, warming to his subject, he roundly abused the whole of the  depot personnel, whom he stigmatized as a set of hard-drinking,  shore-loafing ruffians, who were incapable of realizing that they  existed for the benefit of the boats' personnel and \"material.\"    I naturally disagreed, and did so the more readily that I  conscientiously disagree with him. I find that there is a tendency on  the part of some of these submarine officers, who have been U-boating a  long time, to get into narrow grooves. Most reserve officers are not  like this, as they have only been in during the war. Alten is an  exception; he left the Hamburg-Amerika on two years' half pay in 1912,  and was, of course, kept on in 1914. After all, the depot staff are  Germans, and as such labour for the Fatherland, and though their work  in office and workship is not so dangerous as ours, on the other hand  they have not got the stimulation before their eyes, of glory to be  gained. Personally I am of the opinion that the torpedo broke surface  because, being fired from the outside tubes, it probably started too  shallow, dived deep, recovered shallow and dived deep, broke surface  and dived very deep. A sticky motor or sluggish weight would give this  effect.    And are these external tubes water-tight? Theoretically, yes, but what  of practice? We have been down to forty metres several times during  this trip, and not once have we had a chance on the surface of getting  at the two external tubes; add to which our depth gear, with the pivots  of the weight exposed to water if the tube does flood and then you have  rust, corrosion and heaven knows what complications.    I saw a British Mark 11.50 torpedo at the torpedo shop at Bruges the  other day, and I was much struck with their deep depth gear, which is  of the unrestrained Uhlan type, i.e., weight and valve interdependent.  But then the main feature is that the whole gear is contained in a  separate water-tight chamber.    Our system is certainly a great saving in space, and is much neater in  design, whilst I prefer the Uhlan principle of valve conjuncting with  weight, but it would be interesting to know whether the British have  much trouble with the depth-keeping of their torpedo.    I have written quite a disquisition on depth gears; I must get on with  my record of events.    After lunch we had a good look round, but the small airship was still  hanging about, flying slowly in large circles.    We were rather surprised to meet one of these despicable little  sausages or \"Zeppelin's Spawn,\" as the navigator calls them, so far  from land, and at dark we surfaced and proceeded on one engine on an  easterly course, charging the battery right up with the other engine.    Dawn revealed a blank horizon, not a vestige of mast, funnel or smoke  in sight.    We ambled along in fine though cold weather, and I took advantage of  the peacefulness of everything to do a really good series of Mueller on  the upper deck, stripped to the waist, and allowed the keen air to play  its invigorating currents on my torso.    Alten silently watched me from the conning tower, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7951"],[0,"Glimpses of Bengal (#8)"],[1," clouds there shone forth a blood-red  glare, as through the eyes of a monstrous, sky-filling bison, with tossing  mane and with head lowered to strike the earth in fury.    The crops in the fields and the leaves of the trees trembled with fear of  the impending disaster; shudder after shudder ran across the waters; the  crows flew wildly about, distractedly cawing.          SHAZADPUR,    _29th June 1892._      I wrote yesterday that I had an engagement with Kalidas, the poet, for  this evening. As I lit a candle, drew my chair up to the table, and made  ready, not Kalidas, but the postmaster, walked in. A live postmaster  cannot but claim precedence over a dead poet, so I could not very well  tell him to make way for Kalidas, who was due by appointment,--he would  not have understood me! Therefore I offered him a chair and gave old  Kalidas the go-by.    There is a kind of bond between this postmaster and me. When the post  office was in a part of this estate building, I used to meet him every  day. I wrote my story of \"The Postmaster\" one afternoon in this very room.  And when the story was out in the _Hitabadi_ he came to me with a  succession of bashful smiles, as he deprecatingly touched on the subject.  Anyhow, I like the man. He has a fund of anecdote which I enjoy listening  to. He has also a sense of humour.    Though it was late when the postmaster left, I started at once on the  _Raghuvansa_[1], and read all about the _swayamuara_[2] of  Indumati.    [Footnote 1: Book of poems by Kalidas, who is perhaps best known to  European readers as the author of _Sakuntala_.]    [Footnote 2: An old Indian custom, according to which a princess chooses  among assembled rival suitors for her hand by placing a garland round the  neck of the one whose love she returns.]    The handsome, gaily adorned princes are seated on rows of thrones in the  assembly hall. Suddenly a blast of conch-shell and trumpet resounds, as  Indumati, in bridal robes, supported by Sunanda, is ushered in and stands  in the walk left between them. It was delightful to dwell on the picture.    Then as Sunanda introduces to her each one of the suitors, Indumati bows  low in loveless salutation, and passes on. How beautiful is this humble  courtesy! They are all princes. They are all her seniors. For she is a  mere girl. Had she not atoned for the inevitable rudeness of her rejection  by the grace of her humility, the scene would have lost its beauty.          SHELIDAH,    _20th August 1892._      \"If only I could live there!\" is often thought when looking at a beautiful  landscape painting. That is the kind of longing which is satisfied here,  where one feels alive in a brilliantly coloured picture, with none of the  hardness of reality. When I was a child, illustrations of woodland and  sea, in _Paul and Virginia_, or _Robinson Crusoe_, would waft me  away from the everyday world; and the sunshine here brings back to my mind  the feeling with which I used to gaze on those pictures.    I cannot account for this exactly, or explain definitely what kind of  longing it is which is roused within me. It seems like the throb of some  current flowing through the artery connecting me with the larger world. I  feel as if dim, distant memories come to me of the time when I was one  with the rest of the earth; when on me grew the green grass, and on me  fell the autumn light; when a warm scent of youth would rise from every  pore of my vast, soft, green body at the touch of the rays of the mellow  sun, and a fresh life, a sweet joy, would be half-consciously secreted and  inarticulately poured forth from all the immensity of my being, as it lay  dumbly stretched, with its varied countries and seas and mountains, under  the bright blue sky.    My feelings seem to be those of our ancient earth in the daily ecstasy of  its sun-kissed life; my own consciousness seems to stream through each  blade of grass, each sucking root, to rise with the sap through the trees,  to break out with joyous thrills in the waving fields of corn, in the  rustling palm leaves.    I feel impelled to give expression to my blood-tie with the earth, my  kinsman's love for her; but I am afraid I shall not be understood.          BOALIA,    _18th November 1892._      I am wondering where your train has got to by now. This is the time for  the sun to rise over the ups and downs of the treeless, rocky region near  Nawadih station. The scene around there must be brightened by the fresh  sunlight, through which distant, blue hills are beginning to be faintly  visible.    Cultivated fields are scarcely to be seen, except where the primitive  tribesmen have done a little ploughing with their buffaloes; on each side  of the railway cutting there are the heaped-up black rocks--the  boulder-marked footprints of dried-up streams--and the fidgety, black  wagtails, perched along the telegraph wires. A wild, seamed, and scarred  nature lies there in the sun, as though tamed at the touch of some soft,  bright, cherubic hand.    Do you know the picture which this calls up for me? In the _Sakuntala_ of  Kalidas there is a scene where Bharat, the infant son of King Dushyanta,  is playing with a lion cub. The child is lovingly passing his delicate,  rosy fingers through the rough mane of the great beast, which lies quietly  stretched in trustful repose, now and then casting affectionate glances  out of the corner of its eyes at its little human friend.    And shall I tell you what those dry, boulder-strewn watercourses put me in  mind of? We read in the English fairy tale of the Babes in the Wood, how  the little brother and sister left a trace of their wanderings, through  the unknown forest into which their stepmother had turned them out, by  dropping pebbles as they went. These streamlets are like lost babes in the  great world into which they are sent adrift, and that is why they leave  stones, as they go forth, to mark their course, so as not to lose their  way when they may be returning. But for them there is no return journey!          NATORE,    _2nd December_ 1892.      There is a depth of feeling and breadth of peace in a Bengal sunset behind  the trees which fringe the endless solitary fields, spreading away to the  horizon.    Lovingly, yet sadly withal, does our evening sky bend over and meet the  earth in the distance. It casts a mournful light on the earth it leaves  behind--a light which gives us a taste of the divine grief of the Eternal  Separation[1] and eloquent is the silence which then broods over earth,  sky, and waters.    [Footnote 1: _I.e._ between Purusha and Prakriti--God and Creation.]    As I gaze on in rapt motionlessness, I fall to wondering--If ever this  silence should fail to contain itself, if the expression for which this  hour has been seeking from the beginning of time should break forth, would  a profoundly solemn, poignantly moving music rise from earth to starland?    With a little steadfast concentration of effort we can, for ourselves,  translate the grand harmony of light and colour which permeates the  universe into music. We have only to close our eyes and receive with the  ear of the mind the vibration of this ever-flowing panorama.    But how often shall I write of these sunsets and sunrises? I feel their  renewed freshness every time; yet how am I to attain such renewed  freshness in my attempts at expression?          SHELIDAH,    _9th December_ 1892.      I am feeling weak and relaxed after my painful illness, and in this state  the ministrations of nature are sweet indeed. I feel as if, like the rest,  I too am lazily glittering out my delight at the rays of the sun, and my  letter-writing progresses but absent-mindedly.    The world is ever new to me; like an old friend loved through this and  former lives, the acquaintance between us is both long and deep.    I can well realise how, in ages past, when the earth in her first youth  came forth from her sea-bath and saluted the sun in prayer, I must have  been one of the trees sprung from her new-formed soil, spreading my  foliage in all the freshness of a primal impulse.    The great sea was rocking and swaying and smothering, like a foolishly  fond mother, its first-born land with repeated caresses; while I was  drinking in the sunlight with the whole of my being, quivering under the  blue sky with the unreasoning rapture of the new-born, holding fast and  sucking away at my mother earth with all my roots. In blind joy my leaves  burst forth and my flowers bloomed; and when the dark clouds gathered,  their grateful shade would comfort me with a tender touch.    From age to age, thereafter, have I been diversely reborn on this earth.  So whenever we now sit face to face, alone together, various ancient  memories, gradually, one after another, come back to me.    My mother earth sits to-day in the cornfields by the river-side, in her  raiment of sunlit gold; and near her feet, her knees, her lap, I roll  about and play. Mother of a multitude of children, she attends but  absently to their constant calls on her, with an immense patience, but  also with a certain aloofness. She is seated there, with her far-away look  fastened on the verge of the afternoon sky, while I keep chattering on  untiringly.          BALJA,    _Tuesday, February 1893_.      I do not want to wander about any more. I am pining for a corner in which  to nestle down snugly, away from the crowd.    India has two aspects--in one she is a householder, in the other a  wandering ascetic. The former refuses to budge from the home corner, the  latter has no home at all. I find both these within me. I want to roam  about and see all the wide world, yet I also yearn for a little sheltered  nook; like a bird with its tiny nest for a dwelling, and the vast sky for  flight.    I hanker after a corner because it serves to bring calmness to my mind. My  mind really wants to be busy, but in making the attempt it knocks so  repeatedly against"]]]
