I  remember he used to wind up the talk of an evening when I dined with him  (and got a check) by saying: \"My boy, you have talents, if you'd only  use 'em.\" Where were those talents now? Certainly they had not made me  shine much during the last few hours.    Now, all this seemed unsubstantial, and I remembered these things dimly,  like a dream or a story told to me in childhood; and sometimes, when  recalling the past, I seemed to be thinking about ancient  history--Sesostris, and the Babylonians and Assyrians, and that sort of  thing. And, besides, it would be very hard to get back from a place  where even the name of London was unknown. And perhaps, if I ever should  succeed in getting back, it would only be to encounter a second Roger  Tichborne case, or to be confronted with the statute of limitations.  Anyhow, a year could not make much difference, and I should also keep my  money, which seemed an advantage, though it wasn't much. I looked up:  they were all once more studying the coins and notes, and exchanging  remarks about them.    \"If I bind myself to work one year,\" said I, \"shall I have to wait until  the end of that time before I get the clothes?\"    The reply to this question, I thought, would settle the matter one way  or the other.    \"No,\" said he. \"It is your wish, and also ours, that you should be  differently clothed at once, and the garments you require would be made  for you immediately.\"    \"Then,\" said I, taking the desperate plunge, \"I should like to have them  as soon as possible, and I am ready to commence work at once.\"    \"You shall commence to-morrow morning,\" he answered, smiling at my  impetuosity. \"The daughters of the house, whose province it is to make  these things, shall also suspend other work until your garments are  finished. And now, my son, from this evening you are one of the house  and one of us, and the things which we possess you also possess in  common with us.\"    I rose and thanked him. He too rose, and, after looking round on us with  a fatherly smile, went away to the interior of the house.              Chapter 5    When he was gone, and Yoletta had followed, leaving some of the others  still studying those wretched sovereigns, I sat down again and rested my  chin on my hand; for I was now thinking--deeply: thinking on the terms  of the agreement. \"I daresay I have succeeded in making a precious ass  of myself,\" was the mental reflection that occurred to me--one I had not  infrequently made, and, what is more, been justified in making on former  occasions. Then, remembering that I had come to supper with an  extravagant appetite, it struck me that my host, quietly observant, had,  when proposing terms, taken into account the quantity of food necessary  for my sustenance. I regretted too late that I had not exercised more  restraint; but the hungry man does not and cannot consider consequences,  else a certain hairy gentleman who figures in ancient history had never  lent himself to that nefarious compact, which gave so great an advantage  to a younger but sleek and well-nourished brother. In spite of all this,  I felt a secret satisfaction in the thought of the clothes, and it was  also good to know that the nature of the work I had undertaken would not  lower my status in the house.    Occupied with these reflections, I had failed to observe that the  company had gradually been drifting away until but one person was left  with me--the young man who had talked with me before. On his invitation  I now rose, put by my money, and followed him. Returning by the hall we  went through a passage and entered a room of vast extent, which in its  form and great length and high arched roof was like the nave of a  cathedral. And yet how unlike in that something ethereal in its aspect,  as of a nave in a cloud cathedral, its far-stretching shining floors and  walls and columns, pure white and pearl-gray, faintly touched with  colors of exquisite delicacy. And over it all was the roof of white or  pale gray glass tinged with golden-red--the roof which I had seen from  the outside when it seemed to me like a cloud resting on the stony  summit of a hill.    On coming in I had the impression of an empty, silent place; yet the  inmates of the house were all there; they were sitting and reclining on  low couches, some lying at their ease on straw mats on the floor; some  were reading, others were occupied with some work in their hands, and  some were conversing, the sound coming to me like a faint murmur from a  distance.    At one side, somewhere about the center of the room, there was a broad  raised place, or dais, with a couch on it, on which the father was  reclining at his ease. Beside the couch stood a lectern on which a large  volume rested, and before him there was a brass box or cabinet, and  behind the couch seven polished brass globes were ranged, suspended on  axles resting on bronze frames. These globes varied in size, the largest  being not less than about twelve feet in circumference.    I noticed that there were books on a low stand near me. They were all  folios, very much alike in form and thickness; and seeing presently that  the others were all following their own inclinations, and considering  that I had been left to my own resources and that it is a good plan when  at Rome to do as the Romans do, I by-and-by ventured to help myself to a  volume, which I carried to one of the reading-stands.    Books are grand things--sometimes, thought I, prepared to follow the  advice I had received, and find out by reading all about the customs of  this people, especially their ideas concerning _The House_, which  appeared to be an object of almost religious regard with them. This  would make me quite independent, and teach me how to avoid blundering in  the future, or giving expression to any more \"extraordinary delusions.\"  On opening the volume I was greatly surprised to find that it was richly  illuminated on every leaf, the middle only of each page being occupied  with a rather narrow strip of writing; but the minute letters,  resembling Hebrew characters, were incomprehensible to me. I bore the  disappointment very cheerfully, I must say, for I am not over-fond of  study; and, besides, I could not have paid proper attention to the text,  surrounded with all that distracting beauty of graceful design and  brilliant coloring.    After a while Yoletta came slowly across the room, her fingers engaged  with some kind of wool-work as she walked, and my heart beat fast when  she paused by my side.    \"You are not reading,\" she said, looking curiously at me. \"I have been  watching you for some time.\"    \"Have you indeed?\" said I, not knowing whether to feel flattered or not.  \"No, unfortunately, I can't read this book, as I do not understand the  letters. But what a wonderfully beautiful book it is! I was just  thinking what some of the great London book-buyers--Quaritch, for  instance--would be tempted to give for it. Oh, I am forgetting--you have  never heard his name, of course; but--but what a beautiful book it is!\"    She said nothing in reply, and only looked a little  surprised--disgusted, I feared--at my ignorance, then walked away. I had  hoped that she was going to talk to me, and with keen disappointment  watched her moving across the floor. All the glory seemed now to have  gone out of the leaves of the volume, and I continued turning them over  listlessly, glancing at intervals at the beautiful girl, who was also  like one of the pages before me, wonderful to look at and hard to  understand. In a distant part of the room I saw her place some cushions  on the floor, and settle herself on them to do her work.    The sun had set by this time, and the interior was growing darker by  degrees; the fading light, however, seemed to make no difference to  those who worked or read. They appeared to be gifted with an owlish  vision, able to see with very little light. The father alone did  nothing, but still rested on his couch, perhaps indulging in a  postprandial nap. At length he roused himself and looked around him.    \"There is no melody in our hearts this evening, my children,\" he said.  \"When another day has passed over us it will perhaps be different.  To-night the voice so recently stilled in death forever would be too  painfully missed by all of us.\"    Some one then rose and brought a tall wax taper and placed it near him.  The flame threw a little brightness on the volume, which he now  proceeded to open; and here and there, further away, it flashed and  trembled in points of rainbow-colored light on a tall column; but the  greater part of the room still remained in twilight obscurity.    He began to read aloud, and, although he did not seem to raise his voice  above its usual pitch, the words he uttered fell on my ears with a  distinctness and purity of sound which made them seem like a melody  \"sweetly played in tune.\" The words he read related to life and death,  and such solemn matters; but to my mind his theology seemed somewhat  fantastical, although it is right to confess that I am no judge of such  matters. There was also a great deal about the _house_, which did  not enlighten me much, being too rhapsodical, and when he spoke about  our conduct and aims in life, and things of that kind, I understood him  little better. Here is a part of his discourse:--    \"It is natural to grieve for those that die, because light and knowledge  and love and joy are no longer theirs; but they grieve not any more,  being now asleep on the lap of the Universal Mother, the bride of the  Father, who is with us, sharing our sorrow, which was his first; but it  dims not his everlasting brightness; and his desire and our glory is  that we should always and in all things resemble him.    \"The end of every day is darkness, but the Father of life through our  reason has taught us to mitigate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7413"],[0,"Egyptian Tales, Translated from the Papyri: Second series, XVIIIth to XIXth (#8)"],[1,"out of a group of  myths, ceremonies, and beliefs which were joined and explained by the  formation of such a tale. How far it is due to purely Egyptian ideas,  indicated by the Apis bull and the analogies in present African beliefs,  and how far it is Asiatic and belonging to Atys, it would be premature  to decide. But from the weird confusion and mystery of these  transformations, we turn back with renewed pleasure to the simple and  sweet picture of peasant life, and the beauty of Bata, and we see how  true a poet the Egyptian was in feeling and in expression.          XIXth DYNASTY, PTOLEMAIC WRITING    SETNA AND THE MAGIC BOOK      The mighty King User-maat-ra (Ra-meses the Great) had a son named Setna  Kha-em-uast who was a great scribe, and very learned in all the ancient  writings. And he heard that the magic book of Thoth, by which a man may  enchant heaven and earth, and know the language of all birds and beasts,  was buried in the cemetery of Memphis. And he went to search for it with  his brother An-he-hor-eru; and when they found the tomb of the king's  son, Na-nefer-ka-ptah, son of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,  Mer-neb-ptah, Setna opened it and went in.    Now in the tomb was Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and with him was the _ka_ of his  wife Ahura; for though she was buried at Koptos, her _ka_ dwelt at  Memphis with her husband, whom she loved. And Setna saw them seated  before their offerings, and the book lay between them. And  Na-nefer-ka-ptah said to Setna, \"Who are you that break into my tomb in  this way?\" He said, \"I am Setna, son of the great King User-maat-ra,  living for ever, and I come for that book which I see between you.\" And  Na-nefer-ka-ptah said, \"It cannot be given to you.\" Then said Setna,  \"But I will carry it away by force.\"    Then Ahura said to Setna, \"Do not take this book; for it will bring  trouble on you, as it has upon us. Listen to what we have suffered for it.\"    \"We were the two children of the King Mer-neb-ptah, and he loved us very  much, for he had no others; and Na-nefer-ka-ptah was in his palace as  heir over all the land. And when we were grown, the king said to the  queen, 'I will marry Na-nefer-ka-ptah to the daughter of a general, and  Ahura to the son of another general.' And the queen said, 'No, he is the  heir, let him marry his sister, like the heir of a king, none other is  fit for him.' And the king said, 'That is not fair; they had better be  married to the children of the general.'    \"And the queen said, 'It is you who are not dealing rightly with me.'  And the king answered, 'If I have no more than these two children, is it  right that they should marry one another? I will marry Na-nefer-ka-ptah  to the daughter of an officer, and Ahura to the son of another officer.  It has often been done so in our family.'    \"And at a time when there was a great feast before the king, they came  to fetch me to the feast. And I was very troubled, and did not behave as  I used to do. And the king said to me, 'Ahura, have you sent some one to  me about this sorry matter, saying, \"Let me be married to my elder  brother\"? 'I said to him, 'Well, let me marry the son of an officer, and  he marry the daughter of another officer, as it often happens so in our  family.' I laughed, and the king laughed. And the king told the steward  of the palace, 'Let them take Ahura to the house of Na-nefer-ka-ptah  to-night, and all kinds of good things with her.' So they brought me as  a wife to the house of Na-nefer-ka-ptah; and the king ordered them to  give me presents of silver and gold, and things from the palace.    \"And Na-nefer-ka-ptah passed a happy time with me, and received all the  presents from the palace; and we loved one another. And when I expected  a child, they told the king, and he was most heartily glad; and he sent  me many things, and a present of the best silver and gold and linen. And  when the time came, I bore this little child that is before you. And  they gave him the name of Mer-ab, and registered him in the book of the  'House of life.'    \"And when my brother Na-nefer-ka-ptah went to the cemetery of Memphis,  he did nothing on earth but read the writings that are in the catacombs  of the kings, and the tablets of the 'House of life,' and the  inscriptions that are seen on the monuments, and he worked hard on the  writings. And there was a priest there called Nesi-ptah; and as  Na-nefer-ka-ptah went into a temple to pray, it happened that he went  behind this priest, and was reading the inscriptions that were on the  chapels of the gods. And the priest mocked him and laughed. So  Na-nefer-ka-ptah said to him, 'Why are you laughing at me?' And he  replied, 'I was not laughing at you, or if I happened to do so, it was  at your reading writings that are worthless.  If you wish so much to  read writings, come to me, and I will bring you to the place where the  book is which Thoth himself wrote with his own hand, and which will  bring you to the gods. When you read but two pages in this you will  enchant the heaven, the earth, the abyss, the mountains, and the sea;  you shall know what the birds of the sky and the crawling things are  saying; you shall see the fishes of the deep, for a divine power is  there to bring them up out of the depth. And when you read the second  page, if you are in the world of ghosts, you will become again in the  shape you were in on earth. You will see the sun shining in the sky,  with all the gods, and the full moon.'    \"And Na-nefer-ka-ptah said, 'By the life of the king! Tell me of  anything you want done and I'll do it for you, if you will only send me  where this book is.' And the priest answered Na-nefer-ka-ptah, 'If you  want to go to the place where the book is, you must give me a hundred  pieces of silver for my funeral, and provide that they shall bury me as  a rich priest.' So Na-nefer-ka-ptah called his lad and told him to give  the priest a hundred pieces of silver; and he made them do as he wished,  even everything that he asked for. Then the priest said to  Na-nefer-ka-ptah, 'This book is in the middle of the river at Koptos, in  an iron box; in the iron box is a bronze box; in the bronze box is a  sycamore box; in the sycamore box is an ivory and ebony box; in the  ivory and ebony box is a silver box; in the silver box is a golden box,  and in that is the book. It is twisted all round with snakes and  scorpions and all the other crawling things around the box in which the  book is; and there is a deathless snake by the box.' And when the priest  told Na-nefer-ka-ptah, he did not know where on earth he was, he was so  much delighted.    \"And when he came from the temple he told me all that had happened to  him. And he said, 'I shall go to Koptos, for I must fetch this book; I  will not stay any longer in the north.' And I said, 'Let me dissuade  you, for you prepare sorrow and you will bring me into trouble in the  Thebaid.' And I laid my hand on Na-nefer-ka-ptah, to keep him from going  to Koptos, but he would not listen to me; and he went to the king, and  told the king all that the priest had said. The king asked him, 'What is  it that you want?' and he replied, 'Let them give me the royal boat with  its belongings, for I will go to the south with Ahura and her little boy  Mer-ab, and fetch this book without delay.' So they gave him the royal  boat with its belongings, and we went with him to the haven, and sailed  from there up to Koptos.    \"Then the priests of Isis of Koptos, and the high priest of Isis, came  down to us without waiting, to meet Na-nefer-ka-ptah, and their wives  also came to me. We went into the temple of Isis and Harpokrates; and  Na-nefer-ka-ptah brought an ox, a goose, and some wine, and made a  burnt-offering and a drink-offering before Isis of Koptos and  Harpokrates. They brought us to a very fine house, with all good things;  and Na-nefer-ka-ptah spent four days there and feasted with the priests  of Isis of Koptos, and the wives of the priests of Isis also made  holiday with me.    \"And the morning of the fifth day came; and Na-nefer-ka-ptah called a  priest to him, and made a magic cabin that was full of men and tackle.  He put the spell upon it, and put life in it, and gave them breath, and  sank it in the water. He filled the royal boat with sand, and took leave  of me, and sailed from the haven: and I sat by the river at Koptos that  I might see what would become of him. And he said, 'Workmen, work for  me, even at the place where the book is.' And they toiled by night and  by day; and when they had reached it in three days, he threw the sand  out, and made a shoal in the river. And then he found on it entwined  serpents and scorpions and all kinds of crawling things around the box  in which the book was; and by it he found a deathless snake around the  box. And he laid the spell upon the entwined serpents and scorpions and  all kinds of crawling things which were around the box, that they should  not come out. And he went to the deathless snake, and fought with  him, and killed him; but he came to life again, and took a new form. He  then fought again with him a second time; but he came to life again, and  took a third form. He then cut him in two parts, and put sand  between the parts, that he should not appear again.    \"Na-nefer-ka-ptah then went to the place where he found the box. He  uncovered a box of iron, and opened it; he found then a box of bronze,  and opened that; then he found a box of sycamore wood, and opened that;  again, he found a box of ivory and ebony, and opened that; yet, he found  a box of silver, and opened that; and then he found a box of gold; he  opened that, and found the book in it. He took the book from the golden  box, and read a page of spells from it. He enchanted the heaven and the  earth, the abyss, the mountains, and the sea; he knew what the birds of  the sky, the fish of the deep, and the beasts of the hills all said. He  read another"]]]
