As the news spread men poured into the Perche district from no one knows  where, some armed with only a piece of salt pork, a little meal, and a  prospecting pick; some mounted on mules, others on foot; old men and men  half-crippled were among the number, but all bitten by the monomania  which possesses every prospector. Now there are probably 2,000 men in  the Perche district, and the number of prospects located must far exceed  1,000. Three miners from there with whom I was talking recently owned  forty-seven mines among them, and while one acknowledged that hardly one  prospect in a hundred turns out a prize, the other millionaire in embryo  remarked that he wouldn't take $50,000 for one of his mines. So it goes,  and the victims of the mining fever here seem as deaf to reason as the  buyers of mining stock in New York. Fuel was added to the flame by  the report that Shedd had sold his location, named the Solitaire, to  ex-Governor Tabor and Mr. Wurtzbach on August 25 for $100,000. This was  not true. I met Governor Tabor's representative, who came down recently  to examine the properties, and learned that the Governor had not up to  that date bought the mine. He undoubtedly bonded it, however, and his  representative's opinion of the properties seemed highly favorable.  The Solitaire showed what appeared to be a contact vein, with walls of  porphyry and limestone in a ledge thirty feet wide in places, containing  a high assay of horned silver. The vein was composed of quartz, bearing  sulphides, with horn silver plainly visible, giving an average assay of  from $350 to $500. This was free milling. These were the results shown  simply by surface explorations, which were certainly exceedingly  promising. Recently it has been stated that a little development shows  the vein to be only a blind lead, but the statement lacks confirmation.  In any case the effect of so sensational a discovery is the same in  creating an intense excitement and attracting swarms of prospectors.    But the Perche district does not rest on the Solitaire, for there has  been abundance of mineral wealth discovered throughout its extent. Four  miles south of this prospect, on the middle fork of the Perche, is an  actual mine--the Bullion--which was purchased by four or five Western  mining men for $10,000, and yielded $11,000 in twenty days. The ore  contains horn and native silver. On the same fork are the Iron King and  Andy Johnson, both recently discovered and promising properties, and  there is a valuable mine now in litigation on the south fork of the  Perche, with scores of prospects over the entire district. Now that one  or two sensational strikes have attracted attention, and capital is  developing paying mines, the future of the Perche District seems  assured.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SOY BEAN.      The _British Medical Journal_ says that Prof. E. Kinch, writing in the  _Agricultural Students' Gazette_, says that the Soy bean approaches more  nearly to animal food than any other known vegetable production, being  singularly rich in fat and in albuminoids. It is largely used as  an article of food in China and Japan. Efforts have been made to  acclimatize it in various parts of the continent of Europe, and fair  success has been achieved in Italy and France; many foods are made from  it and its straw is a useful fodder.           *       *       *       *       *          ON A NEW ARC ELECTRIC LAMP.    [Footnote: Paper read at the British Association, Southampton. Revised  by the Author.--_Nature_.]    By W.H. PREECE.      Electric lamps on the arc principle are almost as numerous as the trees  in the forest, and it is somewhat fresh to come upon something that is  novel. In these lamps the carbons are consumed as the current flows, and  it is the variation in their consumption which occasions the flickering  and irregularity of the light that is so irritating to the eyes. Special  mechanical contrivances or regulators have to be used to compensate for  this destruction of the carbons, as in the Siemens and Brush type, or  else refractory materials have to be combined with the carbons, as in  the Jablochkoff candle and in the lamp Soleil. The steadiness of the  light depends upon the regularity with which the carbons are moved  toward each other as they are consumed, so as to maintain the electric  resistance between them a constant quantity. Each lamp must have a  certain elasticity of regulation of its own, to prevent irregularities  from the variable material of carbon used, and from variations in the  current itself and in the machinery.    In all electric lamps, except the Brockie, the regulator is in the lamp  itself. In the Brockie system the regulation is automatic, and is made  at certain rapid intervals by the motor engine. This causes a periodic  blinking that is detrimental to this lamp for internal illumination.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]    M. Abdank, the inventor of the system which I have the pleasure of  bringing before the Section, separates his regulator from his lamp.  The regulator may be fixed anywhere, within easy inspection and  manipulation, and away from any disturbing influence in the lamp. The  lamp can be fixed in any inaccessible place.    _The Lamp_ (Figs. 1, 2, and 3.)--The bottom or negative carbon is fixed,  but the top or positive carbon is movable, in a vertical line. It is  screwed at the point, C, to a brass rod, T (Fig. 2), which moves freely  inside the tubular iron core of an electromagnet, K. This rod is  clutched and lifted by the soft iron armature, A B, when a current  passes through the coil, M M. The mass of the iron in the armature is  distributed so that the greater portion is at one end, B, much nearer  the pole than the other end. Hence this portion is attracted first, the  armature assumes an inclined position, maintained by a brass button, t,  which prevents any adhesion between the armature and the core of the  electromagnet. The electric connection between the carbon and the coil  of the electromagnet is maintained by the flexible wire, S.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    The electromagnet, A (Fig. 1), is fixed to a long and heavy rack, C,  which falls by its own weight and by the weight of the electromagnet and  the carbon fixed to it. The length of the rack is equal to the length of  the two carbons. The fall of the rack is controlled by a friction break,  B (Fig. 3), which acts upon the last of a train of three wheels put  in motion by the above weight. The break, B, is fixed at one end of  a lever, B A, the other end carrying a soft iron armature, F,  easily adjusted by three screws. This armature is attracted by the  electromagnet, E E (whose resistance is 1,200 ohms), whenever a current  circulates through it. The length of the play is regulated by the screw,  V. The spring, L, applies tension to the break.    _The Regulator_.--This consists of a balance and a cut-off.    _The Balance_ (Figs. 4 and 5) is made with two solenoids. S and S',  whose relative resistances is adjustable. S conveys the main current,  and is wound with thick wire having practically no resistance, and S'  is traversed by a shunt current, and is wound with fine wire having a  resistance of 600 ohms. In the axes of these two coils a small and light  iron tube (2 mm. diameter and 60 mm. length) freely moves in a vertical  line between two guides. When magnetized it has one pole in the middle  and the other at each end. The upward motion is controlled by the  spring, N T. The spring rests upon the screw, H, with which it makes  contact by platinum electrodes. This contact is broken whenever the  little iron rod strikes the spring, N T.    The positive lead from the dynamo is attached to the terminal, B, then  passes through the coil, S, to the terminal, B', whence it proceeds to  the lamp. The negative lead is attached to terminal, A, passing directly  to the other terminal, A', and thence to the lamp.    [Illustration: FIG. 4]    The shunt which passes through the fine coil, S', commences at the  point, P. The other end is fixed to the screw, H, whence it has two  paths, the one offering no resistance through the spring, T N, to the  upper negative terminal, A'; the other through the terminal, J, to the  electromagnet of the break, M, and thence to the negative terminal of  the lamp, L'.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    _The Cut-off_.--The last part of the apparatus (Fig. 4) to be described  is the cut-off, which is used when there are several lamps in series. It  is brought into play by the switch, C D, which can be placed at E or D.  When it is at E, the negative terminal, A, is in communication with  the positive terminal, B, through the resistance, R, which equals the  resistance of the lamp, which is, therefore, out of circuit. When it is  at D the cut-off acts automatically to do the same thing when required.  This is done by a solenoid, V, which has two coils, the one of thick  wire offering no resistance, and the other of 2,000 ohms resistance. The  fine wire connects the terminals, A' and B. The solenoid has a movable  soft iron core suspended by the spring, U. It has a cross-piece of iron  which can dip into two mercury cups, G and K, when the core is sucked  into the solenoid. When this is the case, which happens when any  accident occurs to the lamp, the terminal, A, is placed in connection  with the terminal, B, through the thick wire of V and the resistance, R,  in the same way as it was done by the switch, C D.    _Electrical Arrangement_.--The mode in which several lamps are connected  up in series is shown by Fig. 6. M is the dynamo machine. The + lead is  connected to B1 of the balance it then passes to the lamp, L, returning  to the balance, and then proceeds to each other lamp, returning finally  to the negative pole of the machine.

In Bondou the head is  encircled with strings of white beads, and a small plate of gold is worn  in the middle of the forehead. In Kasson, the ladies decorate their  heads, in a very tasteful and elegant manner, with white sea-shells. In  Kaarta and Ludamar, the women raise their hair to a great height by the  addition of a pad, (as the ladies did formerly in Great Britain,) which  they decorate with a species of coral, brought from the Red Sea by  pilgrims returning from Mecca, and sold at a great price.    In the construction of their dwelling-houses, the Mandingoes also conform  to the general practice of the African nations on this part of the  continent, contenting themselves with small and incommodious hovels. A  circular mud wall about four feet high, upon which is placed a conical  roof, composed of the bamboo cane, and thatched with grass, forms alike  the palace of the king, and the hovel of the slave. Their household  furniture is equally simple. A hurdle of canes placed upon upright  stakes, about two feet from the ground, upon which is spread a mat or  bullock's hide, answers the purpose of a bed; a water jar, some earthen  pots for dressing their food, a few wooden bowls and calabashes, and one  or two low stools, compose the rest.    As every man of free condition has a plurality of wives, it is found  necessary (to prevent, I suppose, matrimonial dispute) that each of the  ladies should be accommodated with a hut to herself; and all the huts  belonging to the same family are surrounded by a fence, constructed of  bamboo canes split and formed into a sort of wicker-work. The whole  inclosure is called a _sirk_ or _surk_. A number of these inclosures,  with narrow passages between them, form what is called a town; but the  huts are generally placed without any regularity, according to the  caprice of the owner. The only rule that seems to be attended to, is  placing the door towards the south-west, in order to admit the sea  breeze.    In each town is a large stage called the _Bentang_, which answers the  purpose of a public hall or townhouse; it is composed of interwoven  canes, and is generally sheltered from the sun by being erected in the  shade of some large tree. It is here that all public affairs are  transacted and trials conducted; and here the lazy and indolent meet to  smoke their pipes, and hear the news of the day. In most of the towns the  Mahomedans have also a _missura_, or mosque, in which they assemble and  offer up their daily prayers, according to the rules of the Koran.    In the account which I have thus given of the natives, the reader must  bear in mind, that my observations apply chiefly to persons of _free  condition_, who constitute, I suppose, not more than one-fourth part of  the inhabitants at large; the other three-fourths are in a state of  hopeless and hereditary slavery; and are employed in cultivating the  land, in the care of cattle, and in servile offices of all kinds, much in  the same manner as the slaves in the West Indies. I was told, however,  that the Mandingo master can neither deprive his slave of life, nor sell  him to a stranger, without first calling a palaver on his conduct; or, in  other words, bringing him to a public trial; but this degree of  protection is extended only to the native of domestic slave. Captives  taken in war, and those unfortunate victims who are condemned to slavery  for crimes or insolvency, and, in short, all those unhappy people who are  brought down from the interior countries for sale, have no security  whatever, but may be treated and disposed of in all respects as the owner  thinks proper. It sometimes happens, indeed, when no ships are on the  coast, that a humane and considerate master incorporates his purchased  slaves among his domestics; and their offspring at least, if not the  parents, become entitled to all the privileges of the native class.    The preceding remarks concerning the several nations that inhabit the  banks of the Gambia, are all that I recollect as necessary to be made in  this place, at the outset of my journey. With regard to the Mandingoes,  however, many particulars are yet to be related; some of which are  necessarily interwoven into the narrative of my progress, and others will  be given in a summary at the end of my work; together with all such  observations as I have collected on the country and climate, which I  could not with propriety insert in the regular detail of occurrences.  What remains of the present chapter will therefore, relate solely to the  trade which the nations of Christendom have found means to establish with  the natives of Africa, by the channel of the Gambia; and the inland  traffic which has arisen in consequence of it between the inhabitants of  the coast and the nations of the interior countries.    The earliest European establishment on this celebrated river was a  factory of the Portuguese; and to this must be ascribed the introduction  of the numerous words of that language which are still in use among the  Negroes. The Dutch, French, and English, afterwards successively  possessed themselves of settlements on the coast, but the trade of the  Gambia became and continued for many years a sort of monopoly in the  hands of the English. In the travels of Francis Moore is preserved an  account of the Royal African Company's establishments in this river, in  the year 1730: at which time James' Factory alone consisted of a  governor, deputy governor, and two other principal officers; eight  factors, thirteen writers, twenty inferior attendants and tradesmen; a  company of soldiers, and thirty-two Negro servants, besides sloops,  shallops, and boats with their crews; and there were no less than eight  subordinate factories in other parts of the river.    The trade with Europe, by being afterwards laid open, was almost  annihilated; the share which the subjects of England at this time hold in  it supports not more than two or three annual ships; and I am informed  that the gross value of British exports is under L. .20,000. The French  and Danes still maintain a small share, and the Americans have lately  sent a few vessels to the Gambia by way of experiment.    The commodities exported to the Gambia from Europe consist chiefly of  fire-arms and ammunition, iron ware, spirituous liquors, tobacco, cotton  caps, a small quantity of broad cloth, and a few articles of the  manufacture of Manchester; a small assortment of India goods, with some  glass beads, amber, and other trifles; for which are taken in exchange  slaves, gold dust, ivory, bees-wax, and hides. Slaves are the chief  article, but the whole number which at this time are annually exported  from the Gambia, by all nations, is supposed to be under one thousand.    Most of these unfortunate victims are brought to the coast in periodical  caravans; many of them from very remote inland countries; for the  language which they speak is not understood by the inhabitants of the  maritime districts. In a subsequent part of my work I shall give the best  information I have been able to collect concerning the manner in which  they are obtained. On their arrival at the coast, if no immediate  opportunity offers of selling them to advantage, they are distributed  among the neighbouring villages, until a slave ship arrives, or until  they can be sold to black traders, who sometimes purchase on speculation.  In the meanwhile, the poor wretches are kept constantly fettered, two and  two of them being chained together, and employed in the labours of the  field; and I am sorry to add, are very scantily fed, as well as harshly  treated. The price of a slave varies according to the number of  purchasers from Europe and the arrival of caravans from the interior; but  in general I reckon that a young and healthy male, from 16 to 25 years of  age, may be estimated on the spot from L. 18 to L. 20 sterling.    The Negro slave merchants, as I have observed in the former chapter, are  called _Slatees_; who, besides slaves, and the merchandize which they  bring for sale to the whites, supply the inhabitants of the maritime  districts with native iron, sweet smelling gums and frankincense, and a  commodity called _Shea-toulou_, which, literally translated, signifies  _tree-butter_. This commodity is extracted by means of boiling water from  the kernel of a nut, as will be more particularly described hereafter; it  has the consistence and appearance of butter; and is in truth an  admirable substitute for it. It forms an important article in the food of  the natives, and serves also for every domestic purpose in which oil  would otherwise be used. The demand for it is therefore very great.    In payment of these articles, the maritime states supply the interior  countries with salt, a scarce and valuable commodity, as I frequently and  painfully experienced in the course of my journey. Considerable  quantities of this article, however, are also supplied to the inland  natives by the Moors; who obtain it from the salt pits in the Great  Desert, and receive in return corn, cotton cloth, and slaves.    In thus bartering one commodity for another, many inconveniences must  necessarily have arisen at first from the want of coined money, or some  other visible and determinate medium, to settle the balance, or  difference of value, between different articles, to remedy which, the  natives of the interior make use of small shells called _kowries_, as  will be shown hereafter. On the coast, the inhabitants have adopted a  practice which, I believe, is peculiar to themselves.    In their early intercourse with Europeans, the article that attracted  most notice was iron. Its utility, in forming the instruments of war and  husbandry, made it preferable to all others; and iron soon became the  measure by which the value of all other commodities was ascertained. Thus  a certain quantity of goods, of whatever denomination,"]]]
