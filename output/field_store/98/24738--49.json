So astonished was he, that he even  doubted the check, which was for _five thousand dollars,_ and sent it to  the bank to test its genuineness before he would give a receipt for it!\"      ALL SAVED.      In a dismal basement, A. found a very interesting American family. The  father, in the last stage of consumption; a little girl of ten years, an  invalid from infancy. The mother and two daughters, both under fifteen,  were out all day at work, trying to keep even such a wretched shelter,  and a little coarse food, as daily supplies. The three together could  not make over four dollars a week. The only person to wait on the two  sick ones during the day, was a little boy four years of age, who, when  the missionary entered, was reclining upon the bed. But he started up,  put more coal on the fire, and brought a drink of water, first to his  sister, then his father; without any bidding, and with the consideration  of a grown person.    On A.'s next visit, a few days after, he found the mother at home,  grief-stricken. Her eldest daughter had been taken ill the day previous.  He gave her all the money he had, prayed with them, and sent at once a  kind, assiduous physician. In a few weeks the daughter died, but not  without a good hope in Christ; and was buried at the expense of the few  kind friends whom A. had sent to see the family. The dying daughter  exhorted her dying father to seek his soul's eternal welfare, and not  boast, as heretofore, of his life-long morality. Her conversations led  him to see his danger out of Christ, and, in a little while after his  daughter's departure, he followed. The mother had not before had a sure  Christian hope; but, amidst such influences, her heart was soon opened  to admit the truth. Not long after her bereavement she began having a  \"cottage prayer-meeting\" in her room, and united with an evangelical  church. She immediately became anxious for the conversion of her two  boys, who were away, and urged the missionary to write them. He did so,  frequently, and his heaven-directed appeals led one of the boys very  soon to Christ. Soon after, he died; the brother returned home with  consumption. He took great pleasure in the little prayer-meetings, and  in three months cheerfully and exultantly exchanged this world of  suffering for the one where father, brother and sister awaited him. Worn  out with anxiety, care, hard work and poor health, the mother followed;  leaving the invalid girl and youngest boy; who are watched over, not  only by their Friend in heaven, but friends on earth. The eldest  surviving daughter is an esteemed and consistent member of a church of  Christ.      \"THE LORD WOKE ME UP IN TIME TO SAVE MY CLOTHES.\"      In the very top of a four-story building, used only for various  manufacturing purposes, lived an old man and daughter. They lived  literally _by faith in Christ_, from _day_ to _day_; one hour at a time.  At his voice, followed Him, whether into darkness or light. Neither took  a step but as they held his hand. A lady calling one day, said, \"Oh!  Jennie, I thought of your large wash hanging on the roof, last night,  when the drenching rain came; and I was so sorry to think you would have  your hard work all over again!\" \"_Oh! no ma'am. The Lord woke me up out  of a sound sleep, just as the first few drops fell_! I hastened up and  brought them all down nice and dry, and had only got to the foot of the  stairs with the last armful, when it poured down. Now that was the Lord,  ma'am, for there was not a single noise of any kind to waken me, and I  was sound asleep!\"      THE LORD TAKES AWAY THE CUSTOM OF A LIQUOR SALOON.      At one time, the landlord rented the ground floor to a liquor seller.  The loafers going in and out, especially on Sunday, were a great grief  to Jennie and her saintly old father. They concluded to take it to the  Lord together, and, said the old man, \"He will be sure to attend to it;  I have been young, and now am old, and I have never known Him fail  me--He _never_ does.\" _In three weeks after, the dram-seller closed his  place for want of patronage_.      HELP IN TIME OF NEED.      A poor, humble Christian woman had a claim on some property in a  neighboring State. It was in law, and she was summoned to attend court  at a certain time. Having scarcely money enough for her daily bread, she  was obliged to borrow the means to take her there, and pay some cheap  board while awaiting the conclusion of the trial. She was positively  assured by the lawyers, that she would receive several hundred dollars.  She was detained five weeks, instead of one, as she expected, and then  the suit was postponed till Fall. She was in agony of mind; in a strange  place--owing for board and washing, and no money to take her to her  home. Having spent a whole night pacing the floor and calling on the  Lord to redeem his promises, she felt the fresh air would do her good,  and sadly took her way down a side street. She had gone but three blocks  when she found a diamond ring. Being accustomed to the ownership of  diamonds in her younger days, she knew very nearly its value; took it  home, watched the principal papers, and the same evening saw a reward of  seventy-five dollars offered for it. We can imagine that joy lent wings  to her feet, and thanksgiving filled her whole heart. The sum was  sufficient to pay her bills, bring her back and return a portion of the  borrowed money.      CAST OUT INTO THE STREET, YET NOT FORSAKEN.      A piteous wail was heard on the street one day, and a poor Scotchman  crossed over to see the trouble. A widow and three children sat on their  few articles of household furniture. Put in the street, when they could  no longer find five dollars for the rent of the kennel in which, for six  months, they had not lived, but existed. He had just received five  dollars for a piece of work, and was hurrying home with it to his sick  wife, crippled mother and two children. He thought of the piece of  meat--a long untasted luxury--he meant to buy; of the tea his mother so  much craved, and hesitated. Could he give these up? But the streaming  eyes of the children, and the mute despair on the face of the mother,  took down the scale. He ran several blocks and found an empty basement;  hired it for four dollars; enlisted the sympathy and help of a colored  boy to carry the furniture; put up the stove, bought a bundle of wood,  pail of coal, and some provisions with the other dollar; held a little  prayer-meeting on the spot, and left with the benedictions of the  distressed ones filling his ears. The recital of his adventure  obliterated for the time all sense of their own desires, and they  thanked God together that their loss had been the widow's gain. The next  morning, while taking their frugal meal, a tea dealer, for whom this man  had frequently put up shelves, came to say he was short-handed, and if  the Scotchman was not very busy, he would give him a regular position in  his establishment, at a better salary than he could hope to earn.  Meanwhile, hearing his wife was sick, he had brought her a couple pounds  prime tea, and it occurred to him that venison steaks were a little out  of the ordinary run of meat, and, as he had a quantity at home, he  brought a couple. Thus the Lord answered the prayer of the poor, and  repaid the generous giver who sacrificed his money for the Lord.      A PERSECUTOR PUNISHED BY THE LORD.      A most devout, hard-working and poorly paid man, was the object of  constant persecution by a cross-grained, ugly, infidel neighbor. For  three years the thing went on, till the Christian thought he must remove  from the place. He could not do it without breaking up his humble home,  for which he had worked night and day. He and his wife were in deep  distress; told their plans to the Lord; asked Him to direct them to  another home, and then went to a newspaper office to advertise their  little place for sale. The editor was out, and they preferred to see  him--would return home and call again to-morrow. The next morning the  infidel was found dead in his bed, from a stroke of apoplexy.      HOW GOD ANSWERED MY PRAYER FOR $90.      \"Suffice it, then, I was in debt. I was owing the large sum (large for a  poor home missionary) of $90.00. Expecting soon to be called upon for  the payment of it, and not seeing any way to meet it, _I went to the  Lord with it_. Early in life I had made this resolution: that no man  whom I was _owing_ should ever ask me for money, and I not pay him; but  now, I could see no way out; and if, as I expected, it should be  demanded, I was not in a condition to meet it. Such was my condition  when, on a certain day, the demand came. I took the letter from the  office at noon. What now was to be done? Again I took the case to the  Lord, and asked Him to help me pay it, so that my word need not fail, or  _his cause suffer reproach._ I first determined to pay a part; but, as  no letter could be sent out that day, I awaited the results of the day  following. From the northern mail, which first arrived, I took a letter  containing an unexpected draft of $50 to my wife, from parties whom we  did not know, and had never seen, nor they us. Within twenty minutes  more I was presented with a _surprise_ of $40, from a people where I had  preached for the six months past. Here was my $90, and, before the mail  went out, I had my letter written and in the mail. Both were as  unexpected as if they had come from heaven direct.\"      FROM WEALTH, TO POVERTY.

Meanwhile, the king was endeavoring to create a party in the Parliament,  and Lady Aubigny was intrusted with the negotiations. The plot was,  however, discovered. Several members of Parliament were arrested, and  two executed by orders of the Parliament.    Early in June Colonel Furness and his troop were called into Oxford, as  it was considered probable that some expeditions would be undertaken,  and on the 17th of that month Prince Rupert formed up his horse and  sallied out against the outlying pickets and small troops of the  Parliament. Several of these he surprised and cut up, and on the morning  of the 19th reached Chalgrove Field, near Thame. Hampden was in command  of a detachment of Parliamentary troops in this neighborhood, and  sending word to Essex, who lay near, to come up to his assistance,  attacked Prince Rupert's force. His men, however, could not stand  against the charge of the Royalists. They were completely defeated, and  Hampden, one of the noblest characters of his age, was shot through the  shoulder. He managed to keep his horse, and ride across country to  Thame, where he hoped to obtain medical assistance. After six days of  pain he died there, and thus England lost the only man who could, in  the days that were to come, have moderated, and perhaps defeated, the  ambition of Cromwell.    Essex arrived upon the scene of battle a few minutes after the defeat of  Hampden's force, and Prince Rupert fell back, and crossing the Thames  returned to Oxford, having inflicted much damage upon the enemy.    Shortly after this event, one of the serving men rushed in to Harry with  the news that a strong band of Parliament horse were within three or  four miles of the place, and were approaching. Harry at once sent for  the steward, and a dozen men were summoned in all haste. On their  arrival they set to work to strip the hall of its most valued furniture.  The pictures were taken down from the walls, the silver and plate  tumbled into chests, the arms and armor worn by generations of the  Furnesses removed from the armory, the choicest articles of furniture of  a portable character put into carts, together with some twenty casks of  the choicest wine in the cellars, and in four hours only the heavier  furniture, the chairs and tables, buffets and heavy sideboards remained  in their places.    Just as the carts were filled news came that the enemy had ridden into  Abingdon. Night was now coming on, and the carts at once started with  their contents for distant farms, where the plate and wine were to be  buried in holes dug in copses, and other places little likely to be  searched by the Puritans. The pictures and furniture were stowed away in  lofts and covered deeply with hay.    Having seen the furniture sent off, Harry awaited the arrival of the  Parliament bands, which he doubted not would be dispatched by the  Puritans among the townspeople to the hall. The stables were already  empty except for Rollo, Harry's own horse. This he had at once, the  alarm being given, sent off to a farm a mile distant from the hall, and  with it its saddle, bridle, and his arms, a brace of rare pistols,  breast and back pieces, a steel cap with plumes, and his sword. It cost  him an effort to part with the last, for he now carried it habitually.  But he thought that it might be taken from him, and, moreover, he feared  that he might be driven into drawing it, when the consequences might be  serious, not only for himself, but for the mansion of which his father  had left him in charge.    At nine a servitor came in to say that a party of men were riding up the  drive. Harry seated himself in the colonel's armchair, and repeated to  himself the determination at which he had arrived of being perfectly  calm and collected, and of bearing himself with patience and dignity.  Presently he heard the clatter of horses' hoofs in the courtyard, and  two minutes later, the tramp of feet in the passage. The door opened,  and an officer entered, followed by five or six soldiers.    This man was one of the worst types of Roundhead officers. He was a  London draper, whose violent harangues had brought him into notice, and  secured for him a commission in the raw levies when they were first  raised. Harry rose as he entered.    \"You are the son of the man who is master of this house?\" the officer  said roughly.    \"I am his son and representative,\" Harry said calmly.    \"I hear that he is a malignant fighting in the ranks of King Charles.\"    \"My father is a colonel in the army of his gracious majesty the king,\"  Harry said.    \"You are an insolent young dog!\" the captain exclaimed. \"We will teach  you manners,\" and rising from the seat into which he had thrown himself  on entering the hall, he struck Harry heavily in the face.    The boy staggered back against the wall; then with a bound he snatched  a sword from the hand of one of the troopers, and before the officer had  time to recoil or throw up his hands, he smote him with all his force  across the face. With a terrible cry the officer fell back, and Harry,  throwing down the sword, leaped through the open window into the garden  and dashed into the shrubberies, as half a dozen balls from the pistols  of the astonished troopers whizzed about his head.    For a few minutes he ran at the top of his speed, as he heard shouts and  pistol shots behind him. But he knew that in the darkness strangers  would have no chance whatever of overtaking him, and he slackened his  pace into a trot. As he ran he took himself to task for not having acted  up to his resolution. But the reflection that his father would not  disapprove of his having cut down the man who had struck him consoled  him, and he kept on his way to the farm where he had left his horse. In  other respects, he felt a wild delight at what had happened. There was  nothing for him now but to join the Royal army, and his father could  hardly object to his taking his place with the regiment.    \"I wish I had fifty of them here,\" he thought to himself; \"we would  surround the hall, and pay these traitors dearly. As for their captain,  I would hang him over the door with my own hands. The cowardly ruffian,  to strike an unarmed boy! At any rate I have spoiled his beauty for him,  for I pretty nearly cut his face in two, I shall know him by the scar if  I ever meet him in battle, and then we will finish the quarrel.    \"I shall not be able to see out of my right eye in the morning,\" he  grumbled; \"and shall be a nice figure when I ride into Oxford.\"    As he approached the farm he slackened his speed to a walk; and neared  the house very carefully, for he thought it possible that one of the  parties of the enemy might already have taken up his quarters there. The  silence that reigned, broken by the loud barking of dogs as he came  close, proved that no stranger had yet arrived, and he knocked loudly at  the door. Presently an upper window was opened, and a woman's voice  inquired who he was, and what he wanted.    \"I am Harry Furness, Dame Arden,\" he said. \"The Roundheads are at the  hall, and I have sliced their captain's face; so I must be away with all  speed. Please get the men up, and lose not a moment; I want my arms and  horse.\"    The farmer's wife lost no time in arousing the house, and in a very few  minutes all was ready. One man saddled the horse, while another buckled  on Harry's breast and back pieces; and with a hearty good-by, and amid  many prayers for his safety and speedy return with the king's troops,  Harry rode off into the darkness. For awhile he rode cautiously,  listening intently lest he might fall into the hands of some of the  Roundhead bands. But all was quiet, and after placing another mile or  two between himself and Abingdon, he concluded that he was safe, drew  Rollo's reins tighter, pressed him with his knees, and started at full  gallop for Oxford.          CHAPTER V.    A MISSION OF STATE.      When Harry rode into Oxford with the news that the Roundheads had made a  raid as far as Abingdon, no time was lost in sounding to boot and  saddle, and in half an hour the Cavalier horse were trotting briskly in  that direction. They entered Abingdon unopposed, and found to their  disgust that the Roundheads had departed an hour after their arrival. A  party went up to Furness Hall, and found it also deserted. The  Roundheads, in fact, had made but a flying raid, had carried off one or  two of the leading Royalists in the town, and had, on their retirement,  been accompanied by several of the party favorable to the Commons, among  others, Master Rippinghall and the greater portion of his men, who had,  it was suspected, been already enrolled for the service of the  Parliament. Some of the Royalists would fain have sacked the house of  the wool-stapler; but Colonel Furness, who had accompanied the force  with his troop, opposed this vehemently.    \"As long as we can,\" he said, \"let private houses be respected. If the  Puritans commence, it will be time for us to retort. There are  gentlemen's mansions all over the country, many of them in the heart of  Roundhead neighborhoods, and if they had once an excuse in our  proceedings not one of these would be safe for a minute.\"    Leaving a strong force of horse in Abingdon, Prince Rupert returned to  Oxford, and Colonel Furness again settled down in his residence, his  troop dispersing to their farms until required, a small body only  remaining at Furness Hall as a guard, and in readiness to call the  others to arms if necessary. The colonel warmly approved of the steps  that Harry had taken to save the valuables, and determined that until  the war was at an end these should remain hidden, as it was probable  enough that the chances of the strife might again lead the Roundheads  thither.    \"I hope, father,\" Harry Furness said the following day, \"that you will  now"]]]
