In fact, she actually said she was glad to see  me--a statement no other aunt on the list would have committed herself  to, the customary reaction of these near and dear ones to the spectacle  of Bertram arriving for a visit being a sort of sick horror.    \"Decent of you to rally round, Bertie,\" she said.    \"My place was by your side, Aunt Dahlia,\" I responded.    I could see at a g. that the unfortunate affair had got in amongst her in  no uncertain manner. Her usually cheerful map was clouded, and the genial  smile conspic. by its a. I pressed her hand sympathetically, to indicate  that my heart bled for her.    \"Bad show this, my dear old flesh and blood,\" I said. \"I'm afraid you've  been having a sticky time. You must be worried.\"    She snorted emotionally. She looked like an aunt who has just bitten into  a bad oyster.    \"Worried is right. I haven't had a peaceful moment since I got back from  Cannes. Ever since I put my foot across this blasted threshold,\" said  Aunt Dahlia, returning for the nonce to the hearty _argot_ of the hunting  field, \"everything's been at sixes and sevens. First there was that mix-up  about the prize-giving.\"    She paused at this point and gave me a look. \"I had been meaning to speak  freely to you about your behaviour in that matter, Bertie,\" she said. \"I  had some good things all stored up. But, as you've rallied round like  this, I suppose I shall have to let you off. And, anyway, it is probably  all for the best that you evaded your obligations in that sickeningly  craven way. I have an idea that this Spink-Bottle of yours is going to be  good. If only he can keep off newts.\"    \"Has he been talking about newts?\"    \"He has. Fixing me with a glittering eye, like the Ancient Mariner. But  if that was the worst I had to bear, I wouldn't mind. What I'm worrying  about is what Tom says when he starts talking.\"    \"Uncle Tom?\"    \"I wish there was something else you could call him except 'Uncle Tom',\"  said Aunt Dahlia a little testily. \"Every time you do it, I expect to see  him turn black and start playing the banjo. Yes, Uncle Tom, if you must  have it. I shall have to tell him soon about losing all that money at  baccarat, and, when I do, he will go up like a rocket.\"    \"Still, no doubt Time, the great healer----\"    \"Time, the great healer, be blowed. I've got to get a cheque for five  hundred pounds out of him for _Milady's Boudoir_ by August the third at  the latest.\"    I was concerned. Apart from a nephew's natural interest in an aunt's  refined weekly paper, I had always had a soft spot in my heart for  _Milady's Boudoir_ ever since I contributed that article to it on What  the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing. Sentimental, possibly, but we old  journalists do have these feelings.    \"Is the _Boudoir_ on the rocks?\"    \"It will be if Tom doesn't cough up. It needs help till it has turned the  corner.\"    \"But wasn't it turning the corner two years ago?\"    \"It was. And it's still at it. Till you've run a weekly paper for women,  you don't know what corners are.\"    \"And you think the chances of getting into uncle--into my uncle by  marriage's ribs are slight?\"    \"I'll tell you, Bertie. Up till now, when these subsidies were required,  I have always been able to come to Tom in the gay, confident spirit of an  only child touching an indulgent father for chocolate cream. But he's  just had a demand from the income-tax people for an additional fifty-eight  pounds, one and threepence, and all he's been talking about since I got  back has been ruin and the sinister trend of socialistic legislation and  what will become of us all.\"    I could readily believe it. This Tom has a peculiarity I've noticed in  other very oofy men. Nick him for the paltriest sum, and he lets out a  squawk you can hear at Land's End. He has the stuff in gobs, but he hates  giving up.    \"If it wasn't for Anatole's cooking, I doubt if he would bother to carry  on. Thank God for Anatole, I say.\"    I bowed my head reverently.    \"Good old Anatole,\" I said.    \"Amen,\" said Aunt Dahlia.    Then the look of holy ecstasy, which is always the result of letting the  mind dwell, however briefly, on Anatole's cooking, died out of her face.    \"But don't let me wander from the subject,\" she resumed. \"I was telling  you of the way hell's foundations have been quivering since I got home.  First the prize-giving, then Tom, and now, on top of everything else,  this infernal quarrel between Angela and young Glossop.\"    I nodded gravely. \"I was frightfully sorry to hear of that. Terrible  shock. What was the row about?\"    \"Sharks.\"    \"Eh?\"    \"Sharks. Or, rather, one individual shark. The brute that went for the  poor child when she was aquaplaning at Cannes. You remember Angela's  shark?\"    Certainly I remembered Angela's shark. A man of sensibility does not  forget about a cousin nearly being chewed by monsters of the deep. The  episode was still green in my memory.    In a nutshell, what had occurred was this: You know how you aquaplane. A  motor-boat nips on ahead, trailing a rope. You stand on a board, holding  the rope, and the boat tows you along. And every now and then you lose  your grip on the rope and plunge into the sea and have to swim to your  board again.    A silly process it has always seemed to me, though many find it  diverting.    Well, on the occasion referred to, Angela had just regained her board  after taking a toss, when a great beastly shark came along and cannoned  into it, flinging her into the salty once more. It took her quite a bit  of time to get on again and make the motor-boat chap realize what was up  and haul her to safety, and during that interval you can readily picture  her embarrassment.    According to Angela, the finny denizen kept snapping at her ankles  virtually without cessation, so that by the time help arrived, she was  feeling more like a salted almond at a public dinner than anything human.  Very shaken the poor child had been, I recall, and had talked of nothing  else for weeks.    \"I remember the whole incident vividly,\" I said. \"But how did that start  the trouble?\"    \"She was telling him the story last night.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Her eyes shining and her little hands clasped in girlish excitement.\"    \"No doubt.\"    \"And instead of giving her the understanding and sympathy to which she  was entitled, what do you think this blasted Glossop did? He sat  listening like a lump of dough, as if she had been talking about the  weather, and when she had finished, he took his cigarette holder out of  his mouth and said, 'I expect it was only a floating log'!\"    \"He didn't!\"    \"He did. And when Angela described how the thing had jumped and snapped  at her, he took his cigarette holder out of his mouth again, and said,  'Ah! Probably a flatfish. Quite harmless. No doubt it was just trying to  play.' Well, I mean! What would you have done if you had been Angela? She  has pride, sensibility, all the natural feelings of a good woman. She  told him he was an ass and a fool and an idiot, and didn't know what he  was talking about.\"    I must say I saw the girl's viewpoint. It's only about once in a lifetime  that anything sensational ever happens to one, and when it does, you  don't want people taking all the colour out of it. I remember at school  having to read that stuff where that chap, Othello, tells the girl what a  hell of a time he'd been having among the cannibals and what not. Well,  imagine his feelings if, after he had described some particularly sticky  passage with a cannibal chief and was waiting for the awestruck \"Oh-h!  Not really?\", she had said that the whole thing had no doubt been greatly  exaggerated and that the man had probably really been a prominent local  vegetarian.    Yes, I saw Angela's point of view.    \"But don't tell me that when he saw how shirty she was about it, the  chump didn't back down?\"    \"He didn't. He argued. And one thing led to another until, by easy  stages, they had arrived at the point where she was saying that she  didn't know if he was aware of it, but if he didn't knock off starchy  foods and do exercises every morning, he would be getting as fat as a  pig, and he was talking about this modern habit of girls putting make-up  on their faces, of which he had always disapproved. This continued for a  while, and then there was a loud pop and the air was full of mangled  fragments of their engagement. I'm distracted about it. Thank goodness  you've come, Bertie.\"    \"Nothing could have kept me away,\" I replied, touched. \"I felt you needed  me.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Or, rather,\" she said, \"not you, of course, but Jeeves. The minute all  this happened, I thought of him. The situation obviously cries out for  Jeeves. If ever in the whole history of human affairs there was a moment  when that lofty brain was required about the home, this is it.\"    I think, if I had been standing up, I would have staggered. In fact, I'm  pretty sure I would. But it isn't so dashed easy to stagger when you're  sitting in an arm-chair. Only my face, therefore, showed how deeply I had  been stung by these words.    Until she spoke them, I had been all sweetness and light--the sympathetic  nephew prepared to strain every nerve to do his bit. I now froze, and the  face became hard and set.    \"Jeeves!\" I said, between clenched teeth.    \"Oom beroofen,\" said Aunt Dahlia.    I saw that she had got the wrong angle.    \"I was not sneezing. I was saying 'Jeeves!'\"    \"And well you may. What a man! I'm going to put the whole thing up to  him. There's nobody like Jeeves.\"    My frigidity became more marked.    \"I venture to take issue with you, Aunt Dahlia.\"    \"You take what?\"    \"Issue.\"    \"You do, do you?\"    \"I emphatically do. Jeeves is hopeless.\"    \"What?\"    \"Quite hopeless. He has lost his grip completely. Only a couple of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10556"],[0,"The Old Man in the Corner (#9)"],[1," attempt to run away. The constables had quickly  dismounted, whilst he who had shouted for help originally added more  quietly:    \"'My name is Skelmerton. This is the boundary of my property. I was  smoking a cigar at the pavilion over there with a friend when I heard  loud voices, followed by a cry and a groan. I hurried down the steps,  and saw this poor fellow lying on the ground, with a knife sticking  between his shoulder-blades, and his murderer,' he added, pointing to  the man who stood quietly by with Constable McNaught's firm grip upon  his shoulder, 'still stooping over the body of his victim. I was too  late, I fear, to save the latter, but just in time to grapple with the  assassin--\"    \"'It's a lie!' here interrupted the man hoarsely. 'I didn't do it,  constable; I swear I didn't do it. I saw him fall--I was coming along a  couple of hundred yards away, and I tried to see if the poor fellow was  dead. I swear I didn't do it.'    \"'You'll have to explain that to the inspector presently, my man,' was  Constable McNaught's quiet comment, and, still vigorously protesting his  innocence, the accused allowed himself to be led away, and the body was  conveyed to the station, pending fuller identification.    \"The next morning the papers were full of the tragedy; a column and a  half of the _York Herald_ was devoted to an account of Lord Arthur  Skelmerton's plucky capture of the assassin. The latter had continued to  declare his innocence, but had remarked, it appears, with grim humour,  that he quite saw he was in a tight place, out of which, however, he  would find it easy to extricate himself. He had stated to the police  that the deceased's name was Charles Lavender, a well-known bookmaker,  which fact was soon verified, for many of the murdered man's 'pals'  were still in the city.    \"So far the most pushing of newspaper reporters had been unable to glean  further information from the police; no one doubted, however, but that  the man in charge, who gave his name as George Higgins, had killed the  bookmaker for purposes of robbery. The inquest had been fixed for the  Tuesday after the murder.    \"Lord Arthur had been obliged to stay in York a few days, as his  evidence would be needed. That fact gave the case, perhaps, a certain  amount of interest as far as York and London 'society' were concerned.  Charles Lavender, moreover, was well known on the turf; but no bombshell  exploding beneath the walls of the ancient cathedral city could more  have astonished its inhabitants than the news which, at about five in  the afternoon on the day of the inquest, spread like wildfire throughout  the town. That news was that the inquest had concluded at three o'clock  with a verdict of 'Wilful murder against some person or persons  unknown,' and that two hours later the police had arrested Lord Arthur  Skelmerton at his private residence, 'The Elms,' and charged him on a  warrant with the murder of Charles Lavender, the bookmaker.\"          CHAPTER VIII    THE CAPITAL CHARGE      \"The police, it appears, instinctively feeling that some mystery lurked  round the death of the bookmaker and his supposed murderer's quiet  protestations of innocence, had taken a very considerable amount of  trouble in collecting all the evidence they could for the inquest which  might throw some light upon Charles Lavender's life, previous to his  tragic end. Thus it was that a very large array of witnesses was brought  before the coroner, chief among whom was, of course, Lord Arthur  Skelmerton.    \"The first witnesses called were the two constables, who deposed that,  just as the church clocks in the neighbourhood were striking eleven,  they had heard the cries for help, had ridden to the spot whence the  sounds proceeded, and had found the prisoner in the tight grasp of Lord  Arthur Skelmerton, who at once accused the man of murder, and gave him  in charge. Both constables gave the same version of the incident, and  both were positive as to the time when it occurred.    \"Medical evidence went to prove that the deceased had been stabbed from  behind between the shoulder-blades whilst he was walking, that the wound  was inflicted by a large hunting knife, which was produced, and which  had been left sticking in the wound.    \"Lord Arthur Skelmerton was then called and substantially repeated what  he had already told the constables. He stated, namely, that on the night  in question he had some gentlemen friends to dinner, and afterwards  bridge was played. He himself was not playing much, and at a few minutes  before eleven he strolled out with a cigar as far as the pavilion at the  end of his garden; he then heard the voices, the cry and the groan  previously described by him, and managed to hold the murderer down until  the arrival of the constables.    \"At this point the police proposed to call a witness, James Terry by  name and a bookmaker by profession, who had been chiefly instrumental in  identifying the deceased, a 'pal' of his. It was his evidence which  first introduced that element of sensation into the case which  culminated in the wildly exciting arrest of a Duke's son upon a capital  charge.    \"It appears that on the evening after the Ebor, Terry and Lavender were  in the bar of the Black Swan Hotel having drinks.    \"'I had done pretty well over Peppercorn's fiasco,' he explained, 'but  poor old Lavender was very much down in the dumps; he had held only a  few very small bets against the favourite, and the rest of the day had  been a poor one with him. I asked him if he had any bets with the owner  of Peppercorn, and he told me that he only held one for less than L500.    \"'I laughed and said that if he held one for L5000 it would make no  difference, as from what I had heard from the other fellows, Lord Arthur  Skelmerton must be about stumped. Lavender seemed terribly put out at  this, and swore he would get that L500 out of Lord Arthur, if no one  else got another penny from him.    \"'It's the only money I've made to-day,' he says to me. 'I mean to get  it.'    \"'You won't,' I says.    \"'I will,' he says.    \"'You will have to look pretty sharp about it then,' I says, 'for every  one will be wanting to get something, and first come first served.'    \"'Oh! He'll serve me right enough, never you mind!' says Lavender to me  with a laugh. 'If he don't pay up willingly, I've got that in my pocket  which will make him sit up and open my lady's eyes and Sir John Etty's  too about their precious noble lord.'    \"'Then he seemed to think he had gone too far, and wouldn't say anything  more to me about that affair. I saw him on the course the next day. I  asked him if he had got his L500. He said: \"No, but I shall get it  to-day.\"'    \"Lord Arthur Skelmerton, after having given his own evidence, had left  the court; it was therefore impossible to know how he would take this  account, which threw so serious a light upon an association with the  dead man, of which he himself had said nothing.    \"Nothing could shake James Terry's account of the facts he had placed  before the jury, and when the police informed the coroner that they  proposed to place George Higgins himself in the witness-box, as his  evidence would prove, as it were, a complement and corollary of that of  Terry, the jury very eagerly assented.    \"If James Terry, the bookmaker, loud, florid, vulgar, was an  unprepossessing individual, certainly George Higgins, who was still  under the accusation of murder, was ten thousand times more so.    \"None too clean, slouchy, obsequious yet insolent, he was the very  personification of the cad who haunts the racecourse and who lives not  so much by his own wits as by the lack of them in others. He described  himself as a turf commission agent, whatever that may be.    \"He stated that at about six o'clock on the Friday afternoon, when the  racecourse was still full of people, all hurrying after the day's  excitements, he himself happened to be standing close to the hedge which  marks the boundary of Lord Arthur Skelmerton's grounds. There is a  pavilion there at the end of the garden, he explained, on slightly  elevated ground, and he could hear and see a group of ladies and  gentlemen having tea. Some steps lead down a little to the left of the  garden on to the course, and presently he noticed at the bottom of these  steps Lord Arthur Skelmerton and Charles Lavender standing talking  together. He knew both gentlemen by sight, but he could not see them  very well as they were both partly hidden by the hedge. He was quite  sure that the gentlemen had not seen him, and he could not help  overhearing some of their conversation.    \"'That's my last word, Lavender,' Lord Arthur was saying very quietly.  'I haven't got the money and I can't pay you now. You'll have to wait.'    \"'Wait? I can't wait,' said old Lavender in reply. 'I've got my  engagements to meet, same as you. I'm not going to risk being posted up  as a defaulter while you hold L500 of my money. You'd better give it me  now or--'    \"But Lord Arthur interrupted him very quietly, and said:    \"'Yes, my good man.... or?'    \"'Or I'll let Sir John have a good look at that little bill I had of  yours a couple of years ago. If you'll remember, my lord, it has got at  the bottom of it Sir John's signature in _your_ handwriting. Perhaps  Sir John, or perhaps my lady, would pay me something for that little  bill. If not, the police can have a squint at it. I've held my tongue  long enough, and--'    \"'Look here, Lavender,' said Lord Arthur, 'do you know what this little  game of yours is called in law?'    \"'Yes, and I don't care,' says Lavender. 'If I don't have that L500 I am  a ruined man. If you ruin me I'll do for you, and we shall be quits.  That's my last word.'    \"He was talking very loudly, and I thought some of Lord Arthur's friends  up in the pavilion must have heard. He thought so, too, I think, for he  said quickly:    \"'If you don't hold your"]]]
