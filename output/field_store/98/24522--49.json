You can chase bison, elephants and deer all day without hearing a  single vocal utterance. They know through long experience the  value of silence.    The night after I shot my second elephant we noted an exception.  The herd had been divided by our onslaught. Part of it had gone  north, part of it south, and our camp for the night (beside the  dead tusker) lay midway between the two. About bedtime the  elephants began signalling to each other by trumpeting, and what  they sounded was \"The assembly.\" They called and answered  repeatedly; and finally it became clear to my native followers  that the two herds were advancing to unite, and were likely to  meet in our vicinity. That particular trumpet call was different  from any other I have ever heard. It was a regular \"Hello\" signal-  call, entirely different from the \"Tal-_loo_-e\" blast which  once came from a feeding herd and guided us to it.    But it is only on rare occasions that elephants communicate with  each other by sound. I once knew a general alarm to be  communicated throughout a large herd by the sign language, and a  retreat organized and carried out in absolute silence. Their  danger signals to each other must have been made with their trunks  and their ears; but we saw none of them, because all the animals  were concealed from our view except when the two scouts of the  herd were hunting for us.    In captivity an elephant trumpets in protest, or through fear, or  through rage; but I am obliged to confess that as yet I cannot  positively distinguish one from the other.    Once in the Zoological Park I heard our troublesome Indian  elephant, Alice, roaring continuously as if in pain. It continued  at such a rate that I hurried over to the Elephant House to  investigate. And there I saw a droll spectacle. Keeper Richards  had taken Alice out into her yard for exercise and had ordered  her to follow him. And there he was disgustedly marching around  the yard while Alice marched after him at an interval of ten  paces, quite free and untrammeled, but all the while lustily  trumpeting and roaring in indignant protest. The only point at  which she was hurt was in her feelings.    Two questions that came into public notice concerning the voices  of two important American animals have been permanently settled  by \"the barnyard naturalists\" of New York.    The Voice of the American Bison. In 1907 the statement of George  Catlin, to the effect that in the fall the bellowing of buffalo  bulls on the plains resembled the muttering of distant thunder,  was denied and severely criticized in a sportsman's magazine. On  October 4 of that year, while we were selecting the fifteen bison  to be presented to the Government, to found the Wichita National  Bison Herd, four of us heard our best bull _bellow_ five  times, while another did the same thing four times.    The sound uttered was a deep-voiced roar,--not a grunt,--rising  and falling in measured cadence, and prolonged about four or five  seconds. It was totally different from the ordinary grunt of  hunger, or the menace of an angry buffalo, which is short and  sharp. In discussing the quality of the bellow, we agreed that it  could properly be called a low roar. It is heard only in the  rutting season,--the period described by Catlin,--and there is  good reason to believe that Caitlin's description is perfectly  correct.    The Scream of the Puma. This is a subject that will not lie still.  I presume it will recur every five years as long as pumas endure.  Uncountable pages of controversial letters have been expended upon  the question: \"Does the puma ever scream, like a woman in  distress?\"    The true answer is easy, and uncontestable by people whose minds  are open to the rules of evidence.    Yes; the adult female puma DOES scream,-_in the mating  season_, whenever it comes. It is loud, piercing, prolonged,  and has the agonized voice qualities of a boy or a woman screaming  from the pain of a surgical operation. To one who does not know  the source or the cause, it is nerve-racking. When heard in a  remote wilderness it must be truly fearsome. It says \"Ow-w-w-w!\"  over and over. We have heard it a hundred times or more, and it  easily carries a quarter of a mile.    The language of animals is a long and interesting subject,--so  much so that here it is possible only to sketch out and suggest  its foundations and scope. On birds alone, an entire volume should  be written; but animal intelligence is a subject as far reaching  as the winds of the earth.    No man who ever saw high in the heavens a V-shaped flock of wild  geese, or heard the honk language either afloat, ashore or in the  air, will deny the spoken language of that species. If any one  should do so, let him listen to the wild-goose wonder tales of  Jack Miner, and hear him imitate (to perfection) the honk call of  the gander at his pond, calling to wild flocks in the sky and  telling them about the corn and safety down where he is.    The woodpecker drums on the high and dry limb of a dead tree his  resounding signal-call that is nothing more nor less (in our view)  than so much sign language.    It was many years ago that we first heard in the welcome days of  early spring the resounding _\"Boo-hoo-hoo\"_ courting call of  the cock pinnated grouse, rolling over the moist earth for a mile  or more in words too plain to be misunderstood.    The American magpie talks beautifully; but I regret to say that I  do not understand a word of its language. One summer we had  several fine specimens in the great flying-cage, with the big and  showy waterfowl, condor, griffon vulture, ravens and crows. One of  those magpies often came over to the side of the cage to talk to  me, and as I believe, make complaints. Whether he complained about  his big and bulky cagemates, or the keepers, or me, I could not  tell; but I thought that his grievances were against the large  birds. Whenever I climbed over the guard rail and stooped down, he  would come close up to the wire, stand in one spot, and in a  quiet, confidential tone talk to me earnestly and gesticulate with  his head for five minutes straight. I have heard senile old men  run on in low-voiced, unintelligible clack in precisely the same  way. The modulations of that bird's voice, its inflections and its  vocabulary were wonderful. From his manner a messenger from Mars  might easily have inferred that the bird believed that every word  of the discourse was fully understood.    The lion roars, magnificently. The hyena \"laughs\"; the gray wolf  gives a mournful howl, the coyote barks and howls, and the fox  yaps. The elk bugles, the moose roars and bawls, in desire or  defiance. The elephant trumpets or screams in the joy of good  feeding, or in fear or rage; and it also rumbles deeply away down  in its throat. The red squirrel barks and chatters, usually to  scold some one whom he hates, but other small rodents know that  silence is golden.    The birds have the best voices of all creatures. They are the  sweet singers of the animal world, and to the inquiring mind that  field is a wonderland.    The frogs are vociferous; and now if they were more silent they  would last longer.    Of all the reptiles known to me, only two utter vocal sounds,--the  alligator and the elephant tortoise. The former roars or bellows,  the latter grunts.          IV    THE MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMALS      To the professional animal-man, year in and year out comes the  eternal question, \"Which are the most intelligent animals?\"    The question is entirely legitimate. What animals are the best  exponents of animal intelligence?    It seems to me that the numerous factors involved, and the  comparisons that must be made, can best be expressed in figures.  Opinions that are based upon only one or two sets of facts are not  worth much. There are about ten factors to be taken into account  and appraised separately.    In order to express many opinions in a small amount of space, we  submit a table of estimates and summaries, covering a few  mammalian species that are representative of many. But, try as  they will, it is not likely that any two animal men will set down  the same estimates. It all depends upon the wealth or the poverty  of first-hand, eye-witness evidence. When we enter the field of  evidence that must stand in quotation marks, we cease to know  where we will come out. We desire to state that nearly all of the  figures in the attached table of estimates are based upon the  author's own observations, made during a period of more than  forty years of ups and downs with wild animals.

In explanation of the terms, \"eternal punishment,\" and \"everlasting  punishment,\" sometimes found in Holy Writ, the Lord said to the  Prophet: \"Behold, I am endless, and the punishment which is given from  my hand is endless, for endless is my name. Wherefore--    \"Eternal punishment is God's punishment.    \"Endless punishment is God's punishment.\"    That is to say, the punishment takes the name of Him in whose name  it is inflicted; as if it were written, \"Eternal's punishment,\"  \"Endless's punishment.\" And also, it must be understood, that the  punishment itself is endless. That is, penalties always attend upon  law, and follow its violation. That is an eternal principle. Law is  inconceivable without accompanying penalties. But it does not follow  that those who fall into the transgression of law, and therefore under  sentence of Eternal's justice, will have to endure affliction of the  penalty eternally. Justice can be satisfied. Mercy must be accorded her  claims, and the culprit having been brought to repentance and taught  obedience to law through the things which he has suffered, must go  free. But only to suffer again the penalties of the law, if he again  violates it; for laws and their penalties are eternal. Hence eternal  punishment, hence endless punishment administered to the violator of  the law, until he learns to live in harmony with law. For, on the one  hand, as \"that which is governed by law is also preserved by law, and  perfected and sanctified by the same;\" [23] so \"that which breaketh  a law and abideth not by the law, but seeketh to become a law unto  itself, and willeth to abide in sin and altogether abideth in sin,  cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment.  Therefore they must remain filthy still.\" [24] Thus obedience to law  becomes a savor of life unto life; while disobedience to law equally  becomes a savor of death unto death.    In February, 1832, still further light was shed upon the subject of  {XXXV} the different states or degrees of glory in which men will live  in the future, by the revelation known as \"The Vision.\" This revelation  is one of the sublimest ever given to man. It utterly discredits and  displaces the dogmas about the future of man held by Christendom, or  at least by Protestant Christendom. The orthodox, Protestant view  of man's future is that there are two states in one or the other of  which man will spend eternity--in heaven or in hell. If one shall gain  heaven, even by ever so small a margin, he will enter immediately upon  a complete possession of all its unspeakable joys, equally with the  angels and the holiest of Saints. Not only in the \"Shorter Catechisms,\"  but in nearly all orthodox creeds the accepted doctrine was: \"The souls  of believers are at their death made perfect in holiness.\" On the  other hand, if one shall miss heaven, even by ever so small a margin,  he is doomed to everlasting torment equally with the wickedest of men  and vilest of devils, and there is no deliverance for him through  all the countless ages of eternity! It will be noted that I have  excepted out of participating in the above view of man's future, the  Catholic church, by ascribing these views only to orthodox Protestant  Christendom. This is because the Catholic church doctrine slightly  differs from the doctrine of the Protestants on this subject. That is  Catholics do not believe that all Christians at death go immediately  into heaven, but on the contrary \"believe that a Christian who dies  after the guilt and everlasting punishment of mortal sins have been  forgiven him, but who, either from want of opportunity, or through  his negligence has not discharged the debt of temporal punishment due  to his sin, will have to discharge that debt to the justice of God  in purgatory.\" \"Purgatory is a state of suffering after this life,  in which those souls are for a time detained, which depart this life  after their deadly sins have been remitted as to the stain and guilt,  and as to the everlasting pain that was due to them, but which souls  have on account of those sins still some temporal punishment to pay; as  also those souls which leave this world guilty only of venial (that is  pardonable) sins. In purgatory these souls are purified and rendered  fit to enter into heaven, where nothing defiled enters.\" [25] As all  works of the Catholic church accessible to me have nothing on the  different degrees of glory in which men shall subsist in eternity, I  conclude that Catholic teaching is that they who finally attain unto  heaven are all equal in glory. So that in the last analysis of the  matter, Catholic doctrine falls as far below the great truth that God  has revealed upon the subject of the future estate of man, as the  doctrine of orthodox Protestant Christendom.    Here is not the place for an extended exposition of the doctrine in  {XXXVI} relation to the future state of man as revealed to Joseph Smith  in the revelation called \"The Vision.\" [26] It must suffice here to say  that its central principle is resident in the justice and the mercy  of God, that requires that every man shall be judged according to his  works, considered in the light of his intelligence, his consciousness  of right and wrong, and the moral law under which he lived. If he lived  in the earth when the Gospel of Jesus Christ was not in the world, or  if he lived at places or in circumstances where he did not learn of  its existence, much less come to a knowledge of its truths, then the  plain dictates of justice demand that some means must exist by which  its sanctifying powers may be applied to him in the future; so also as  to those who have even once rejected the truth (as in the case of the  antediluvians who rejected the teaching of righteous Noah, and were  disobedient, [27] when once the long suffering of God waited in vain  in those days for their repentance); having paid the just penalty of  their disobedience, then justice would demand that some means must  exist by which the saving principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ may  be applied to them; for only by the acceptance of the principles of the  Gospel, and by the application of its laws and ordinances as the means  by which the grace of God is applied to man, can the sons of men hope  for salvation. Then as men differ in degree of intelligence; in the  intensity of their faith; in the hartiness of their obedience; in the  steadiness of their fidelity; and in as much as there is the stern fact  of human freedom and responsibility, and the possibility of a short  or long resistance to the will of God, even up to eternal resistance  to that will, there is an infinitude of states of glory, of so called  rewards and punishments, in which man will live in the future. There  is one glory of which the sun in heaven is spoken of as being typical;  another of which the inferior light of the moon is typical; and another  of which the varying light of the stars is typical. And even as one  star differs from another star in glory, in light, so differ those  states of existence in which men will live in the future, but each  assigned to a place, to an environment, that corresponds to the status  of his development; which is only the modern way of saying he shall  be judged according to his works. These, in brief, are the underlying  principles of this remarkable revelation; a revelation which in every  way is worthy the encomium that the Prophet Joseph himself bestowed  upon it at the time of its inception: \"Nothing could be more pleasing  to the Saints upon the order of the Kingdom of the Lord, than the light  which burst upon the world through the foregoing Vision. Every law,  every commandment, every promise, every truth, and every point touching  the destiny of man, from Genesis to Revelation, where the purity of  the {XXXVII} Scriptures remains unsullied by the folly of men, go to  show the perfection of the theory [of different degrees of glory in the  future life] and witnesses the fact that _that document is a transcript  from the records of the eternal world_.\"    In June, 1836, while attending to washings and anointings in the  Kirtland Temple, previous to its dedication, the Prophet received still  further knowledge as to the future state of man. This also was by means  of a vision. He says: \"The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld  the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the  body or out, I cannot tell. I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate  through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like  unto circling flames of fire; also the blazing throne of God, whereon  was seated the Father and the Son. I saw the beautiful streets of that  kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold. I saw  Fathers Adam and Abraham, and my father and mother, my brother, Alvin,  that has long since slept, and marveled how it was that he had obtained  an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life  before the Lord had set His hand to gather Israel the second time, and  had not been baptized for the remission of sins. Thus came the voice of  the Lord unto me saying--    \"_All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have  received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the  celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without  a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts,  shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men  according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts_.\"    \"And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the  years of accountability, are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.\"    The next step in the development of this doctrine of salvation for the  dead was the coming of Elijah to \"turn the heart of the fathers to the  children, and the heart of the children to the fathers,\""]]]
