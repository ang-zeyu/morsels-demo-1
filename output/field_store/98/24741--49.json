I was treated to a great deal of harping on that tiresome old string,  \"Whatsoever your hand findeth to do, do it with all your might.\" It was  daily dinned into my cars that the little things of life were the  noblest, and that all the great people I mooned about said the same. I  usually retorted to the effect that I was well aware that it was noble,  and that I could write as good an essay on it as any philosopher. It was  all very well for great people to point out the greatness of the little,  empty, humdrum life. Why didn't they adopt it themselves?        \"The toad beneath the harrow knows       Exactly where each tooth-point goes.       The butterfly upon the road       Preaches contentment to the toad.\"    I wasn't anxious to patronize the dull kind of tame nobility of the  toad; I longed for a few of the triumphs of the butterfly, decried  though they are as hollow bubbles. I desired life while young enough to  live, and quoted as my motto:        \"Though the pitcher that goes to the sparkling rill       Too oft gets broken at last,       There are scores of others its place to fill       When its earth to the earth is cast.       Keep that pitcher at home, let it never roam,       But lie like a useless clod;       Yet sooner or later the hour will come       When its chips are thrown to the sod.        \"Is it wise, then, say, in the waning day,       When the vessel is crack'd and old,       To cherish the battered potter's clay       As though it were virgin gold?       Take care of yourself, dull, boorish elf,       Though prudent and sage you seem;       Your pitcher will break on the musty shelf,       And mine by the dazzling stream.\"    I had sense sufficient to see the uselessness of attempting to be other  than I was. In these days of fierce competition there was no chance for  me--opportunity, not talent, was the main requisite. Fate had thought  fit to deny me even one advantage or opportunity, thus I was helpless. I  set to work to cut my coat according to my cloth. I manfully endeavoured  to squeeze my spirit into \"that state of life into which it has pleased  God to call me\". I crushed, compressed, and bruised, but as fast as I  managed it on one side it burst out on another, and defied me to cram it  into the narrow box of Possum Gully.        \"The restless throbbings and burnings         That hope unsatisfied brings,       The weary longings and yearnings         For the mystical better things,       Are the sands on which is reflected         The pitiless moving lake,       Where the wanderer falls dejected,         By a thirst he never can slake.\"    In a vain endeavour to slake that cruel thirst my soul groped in strange  dark places. It went out in quest of a God, and finding one not, grew  weary.    By the unknown way that the atmosphere of the higher life penetrated to  me, so came a knowledge of the sin and sorrow abroad in the world--the  cry of the millions oppressed, downtrodden, God-forsaken! The wheels of  social mechanism needed readjusting--things were awry. Oh, that I might  find a cure and give it to my fellows! I dizzied my brain with the  problem; I was too much for myself. A man with these notions is a curse  to himself, but a woman--pity help a woman of that description! She is  not merely a creature out of her sphere, she is a creature without a  sphere--a lonely being!    Recognizing this, I turned and cursed God for casting upon me a burden  greater than I could bear--cursed Him bitterly, and from within came a  whisper that there was nothing there to curse. There was no God. I was  an unbeliever. It was not that I sought after or desired atheism. I  longed to be a Christian, and fought against unbelief. I asked the  Christians around me for help. Unsophisticated fool! I might as well  have announced that I was a harlot. My respectability vanished in one  slap. Some said it was impossible to disbelieve in the existence of a  God: I was only doing it for notoriety, and they washed their hands of  me at once.    Not believe in God! I was mad!    If there really was a God, would they kindly tell me how to find Him?    Pray! pray!    I prayed, often and ardently, but ever came that heart-stilling whisper  that there was nothing to pray to.    Ah, the bitter, hopeless heart-hunger of godlessness none but an atheist  can understand! Nothing to live for in life--no hope beyond the grave.  It plunged me into fits of profound melancholy.    Had my father occupied one of the fat positions of the land, no doubt as  his daughter my life would have been so full of pleasant occupation and  pleasure that I would not have developed the spirit which torments me  now. Or had I a friend--one who knew, who had suffered and understood,  one in whom I could lose myself, one on whom I could lean--I might have  grown a nicer character. But in all the wide world there was not a soul  to hold out a hand to me, and I said bitterly, \"There is no good in the  world.\" In softer moods I said, \"Ah, the tangle of it! Those who have  the heart to help have not the power, and those who have the power have  not the heart.\"    Bad, like a too-strong opponent in a game of chess, is ever at the elbow  of good to checkmate it like a weakly managed king.    I am sadly lacking in self-reliance. I needed some one to help me over  the rough spots in life, and finding them not, at the age of sixteen I  was as rank a cynic and infidel as could be found in three days' march.          CHAPTER EIGHT    Possum Gully Left Behind. Hurrah! Hurrah!      If a Sydney man has friends residing at Goulburn, he says they are up  the country. If a Goulburn man has friends at Yass, he says they are up  the country. If a Yass man has friends at Young, he says they are up the  country, and so on. Caddagat is \"up the country\".    Bound thither on the second Wednesday in August 1896, I bought a ticket  at the Goulburn railway station, and at some time about 1 a.m. took my  seat in a second class carriage of the mail-train on its way to  Melbourne. I had three or four hours to travel in this train when I  would have to change to a branch line for two hours longer. I was the  only one from Goulburn in that carriage; all the other passengers had  been in some time and were asleep. One or two opened their eyes  strugglingly, stared glumly at the intruder, and then went to sleep  again. The motion of the train was a joy to me, and sleep never entered  my head. I stood up, and pressing my forehead to the cold window-pane,  vainly attempted, through the inky blackness of the foggy night, to  discern the objects which flew by.    I was too full of pleasant anticipation of what was ahead of me to think  of those I had left behind. I did not regret leaving Possum Gully. Quite  the reverse; I felt inclined to wave my arms and yell for joy at being  freed from it. Home! God forbid that my experiences at Possum Gully  should form the only food for my reminiscences of home. I had  practically grown up there, but my heart refused absolutely to regard it  as home. I hated it then, I hate it now, with its narrowing, stagnant  monotony. It has and had not provided me with one solitary fond  remembrance--only with dreary, wing-clipping, mind-starving  recollections. No, no; I was not leaving home behind, I was flying  homeward now. Home, home to Caddagat, home to ferny gullies, to the  sweet sad rush of many mountain waters, to the majesty of rugged  Borgongs; home to dear old grannie, and uncle and aunt, to books, to  music; refinement, company, pleasure, and the dear old homestead I love  so well.    All in good time I arrived at the end of my train journey, and was taken  in charge by a big red-bearded man, who informed me he was the driver of  the mail-coach, and had received a letter from Mrs Bossier instructing  him to take care of me. He informed me also that he was glad to do what  he termed \"that same\", and I would be as safe under his care as I would  be in God's pocket.    My twenty-six miles' coach drive was neither pleasant nor eventful. I  was the only passenger, and so had my choice of seats. The weather being  cold and wet, I preferred being inside the box and curled myself up on  the seat, to be interrupted every two or three miles by the good-natured  driver inquiring if I was \"all serene\".    At the Halfway House, where a change of the team of five horses was  affected, I had a meal and a warm, and so tuned myself up for the  remainder of the way. It got colder as we went on, and at 2.30 p.m. I  was not at all sorry to see the iron roofs of Gool-Gool township  disclosing to my view. We first went to the post office, where the  mail-bags were delivered, and then returned and pulled rein in front of  the Woolpack Hotel. A tall young gentleman in a mackintosh and cap, who  had been standing on the veranda, stepped out on the street as the coach  stopped, and lifting his cap and thrusting his head into the coach,  inquired, \"Which is Miss Melvyn?\"    Seeing I was the only occupant, he laughed the pleasantest of laughs,  disclosing two wide rows of perfect teeth, and turning to the driver,  said, \"Is that your only passenger? I suppose it is Miss Melvyn?\"    \"As I wasn't present at her birth, I can't swear, but I believe her to  be that same, as sure as eggs is eggs,\" he replied.    My identity being thus established, the young gentleman with the  greatest of courtesy assisted me to alight, ordered the hotel groom to  stow my luggage in the Caddagat buggy, and harness the horses with all  expedition. He then conducted me to the private parlour, where a  friendly little barmaid had some refreshments on a tray awaiting me, and  while warming my feet preparatory to eating I read the letter he had  given me, which was addressed in my grandmother's handwriting. In it she  told me that she and my aunt were only just recovering from bad colds,  and on account of the inclemency of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11637"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Portus Cale  was afterwards called \"O Porto\" (the harbour,) which name the town of  Oporto ultimately received.

There cannot be a grand dinner in Russia without sterlet. In summer,  when brought alive from Archangel, &c., these cost from five hundred to  one thousand rubles each; a fish soup, made with champagne and other  expensive wines, has been known to cost three thousand rubles; no water  is allowed to enter into the composition of these expensive soups; and  the whole company get very merry and talkative after partaking of them.    _Honest Tar._--John Barth, the Dunkirk fisherman, rose by his courage  and naval skill, to the rank of commodore of a squadron in the navy of  France.
