It was  as clear as daylight that the place held some secret, and I wondered if  old Japp knew.  I was fool enough one day to ask him about diamonds.  He met me with contemptuous laughter.  'There's your ignorant  Britisher,' he cried.  'If you had ever been to Kimberley you would  know the look of a diamond country.  You're as likely to find diamonds  here as ocean pearls.  But go out and scrape in the spruit if you like;  you'll maybe find some garnets.'    I made cautious inquiries, too, chiefly through Mr Wardlaw, who was  becoming a great expert at Kaffir, about the existence of Aitken's  wizard, but he could get no news.  The most he found out was that there  was a good cure for fever among Sikitola's men, and that Majinje, if  she pleased, could bring rain.    The upshot of it all was that, after much brooding, I wrote a letter to  Mr Colles, and, to make sure of its going, gave it to a missionary to  post in Pietersdorp.  I told him frankly what Aitken had said, and I  also told him about the espionage.  I said nothing about old Japp, for,  beast as he was, I did not want him at his age to be without a  livelihood.        CHAPTER IV    MY JOURNEY TO THE WINTER-VELD    A reply came from Colles, addressed not to me but to Japp. It seemed  that the old fellow had once suggested the establishment of a branch  store at a place out in the plains called Umvelos', and the firm was  now prepared to take up the scheme.  Japp was in high good humour, and  showed me the letter.  Not a word was said of what I had written about,  only the bare details about starting the branch.  I was to get a couple  of masons, load up two wagons with bricks and timber, and go down to  Umvelos' and see the store built.  The stocking of it and the  appointment of a storekeeper would be matter for further  correspondence.  Japp was delighted, for, besides getting rid of me for  several weeks, it showed that his advice was respected by his  superiors.  He went about bragging that the firm could not get on  without him, and was inclined to be more insolent to me than usual in  his new self-esteem.  He also got royally drunk over the head of it.    I confess I was hurt by the manager's silence on what seemed to me more  vital matters.  But I soon reflected that if he wrote at all he would  write direct to me, and I eagerly watched for the post-runner.  No  letter came, however, and I was soon too busy with preparations to look  for one.  I got the bricks and timber from Pietersdorp, and hired two  Dutch masons to run the job.  The place was not very far from  Sikitola's kraal, so there would be no difficulty about native helpers.  Having my eyes open for trade, I resolved to kill two birds with one  stone.  It was the fashion among the old-fashioned farmers on the  high-veld to drive the cattle down into the bush-veld--which they call  the winter-veld--for winter pasture.  There is no fear of red-water  about that season, and the grass of the plains is rich and thick  compared with the uplands.  I discovered that some big droves were  passing on a certain day, and that the owners and their families were  travelling with them in wagons.  Accordingly I had a light _naachtmaal_  fitted up as a sort of travelling store, and with my two wagons full of  building material joined the caravan.  I hoped to do good trade in  selling little luxuries to the farmers on the road and at Umvelos'.    It was a clear cold morning when we started down the Berg. At first my  hands were full with the job of getting my heavy wagons down the  awesome precipice which did duty as a highway.  We locked the wheels  with chains, and tied great logs of wood behind to act as brakes.  Happily my drivers knew their business, but one of the Boer wagons got  a wheel over the edge, and it was all that ten men could do to get it  back again.    After that the road was easier, winding down the side of a slowly  opening glen.  I rode beside the wagons, and so heavenly was the  weather that I was content with my own thoughts. The sky was clear  blue, the air warm, yet with a wintry tonic in it, and a thousand  aromatic scents came out of the thickets. The pied birds called 'Kaffir  queens' fluttered across the path. Below, the Klein Labongo churned and  foamed in a hundred cascades.  Its waters were no more the clear grey  of the 'Blue Wildebeeste's Spring,' but growing muddy with its approach  to the richer soil of the plains.    Oxen travel slow, and we outspanned that night half a day's march short  of Umvelos'.  I spent the hour before sunset lounging and smoking with  the Dutch farmers.  At first they had been silent and suspicious of a  newcomer, but by this time I talked their taal fluently, and we were  soon on good terms. I recall a discussion arising about a black thing  in a tree about five hundred yards away.  I thought it was an aasvogel,  but another thought it was a baboon.  Whereupon the oldest of the  party, a farmer called Coetzee, whipped up his rifle and, apparently  without sighting, fired.  A dark object fell out of the branch, and  when we reached it we found it a _baviaan_[1] sure enough, shot through  the head.  'Which side are you on in the next war?' the old man asked  me, and, laughing, I told him 'Yours.'    After supper, the ingredients of which came largely from my _naachtmaal_,  we sat smoking and talking round the fire, the women and children being  snug in the covered wagons.  The Boers were honest companionable  fellows, and when I had made a bowl of toddy in the Scotch fashion to  keep out the evening chill, we all became excellent friends.  They  asked me how I got on with Japp.  Old Coetzee saved me the trouble of  answering, for he broke in with _Skellum_!  _Skellum_![2]  I asked him his  objection to the storekeeper, but he would say nothing beyond that he  was too thick with the natives.  I fancy at some time Mr Japp had sold  him a bad plough.    We spoke of hunting, and I heard long tales of exploits--away on the  Limpopo, in Mashonaland, on the Sabi and in the Lebombo.  Then we  verged on politics, and I listened to violent denunciations of the new  land tax.  These were old residenters, I reflected, and I might learn  perhaps something of value.  So very carefully I repeated a tale I said  I had heard at Durban of a great wizard somewhere in the Berg, and  asked if any one knew of it.  They shook their heads.  The natives had  given up witchcraft and big medicine, they said, and were more afraid  of a parson or a policeman than any witch-doctor. Then they were  starting on reminiscences, when old Coetzee, who was deaf, broke in and  asked to have my question repeated.    'Yes,' he said, 'I know.  It is in the Rooirand.  There is a devil  dwells there.'    I could get no more out of him beyond the fact that there was certainly  a great devil there.  His grandfather and father had seen it, and he  himself had heard it roaring when he had gone there as a boy to hunt.  He would explain no further, and went to bed.    Next morning, close to Sikitola's kraal, I bade the farmers good-bye,  after telling them that there would be a store in my wagon for three  weeks at Umvelos' if they wanted supplies. We then struck more to the  north towards our destination.  As soon as they had gone I had out my  map and searched it for the name old Coetzee had mentioned.  It was a  very bad map, for there had been no surveying east of the Berg, and  most of the names were mere guesses.  But I found the word 'Rooirand'  marking an eastern continuation of the northern wall, and probably set  down from some hunter's report.  I had better explain here the chief  features of the country, for they bulk largely in my story.  The Berg  runs north and south, and from it run the chief streams which water the  plain.  They are, beginning from the south, the Olifants, the Groot  Letaba, the Letsitela, the Klein Letaba, and the Klein Labongo, on  which stands Blaauwildebeestefontein.  But the greatest river of the  plain, into which the others ultimately flow, is the Groot Labongo,  which appears full-born from some subterranean source close to the  place called Umvelos'.  North from Blaauwildebeestefontein the Berg  runs for some twenty miles, and then makes a sharp turn eastward,  becoming, according to my map, the Rooirand.    I pored over these details, and was particularly curious about the  Great Labongo.  It seemed to me unlikely that a spring in the bush  could produce so great a river, and I decided that its source must lie  in the mountains to the north.  As well as I could guess, the Rooirand,  the nearest part of the Berg, was about thirty miles distant.  Old  Coetzee had said that there was a devil in the place, but I thought  that if it were explored the first thing found would be a fine stream  of water.    We got to Umvelos' after midday, and outspanned for our three weeks'  work.  I set the Dutchmen to unload and clear the ground for  foundations, while I went off to Sikitola to ask for labourers.  I got  a dozen lusty blacks, and soon we had a business-like encampment, and  the work went on merrily.  It was rough architecture and rougher  masonry.  All we aimed at was a two-roomed shop with a kind of outhouse  for stores.  I was architect, and watched the marking out of the  foundations and the first few feet of the walls.  Sikitola's people  proved themselves good helpers, and most of the building was left to  them, while the Dutchmen worked at the carpentry.  Bricks ran short  before we got very far, and we had to set to brick-making on the bank  of the Labongo, and finish off the walls with green bricks, which gave  the place a queer piebald look.    I was not much of a carpenter, and there were plenty of builders  without me, so I found a considerable amount of time on my hands.  At  first I acted as shopkeeper in the _naachtmaal_, but I soon cleared out  my stores to the Dutch"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6112"],[0,"Nature and Human Nature (#8)"],[1,"heart.

As we approached the eastern coast, \"Eldad,\" sais I, to the pilot, \"is  there any harbour about here where our folks can do a little bit of  trade, and where I can see something of 'Fishermen at home?'\"    \"We must be careful now how we proceed, for if the 'Spitfire' floats  at the flood, Captain Stoker will try perhaps to overhaul us.\"    \"Don't we want to wood and water, and ain't there some repairs  wanting,\" sais I, and I gave him a wink. \"If so we can put into port;  but I don't think we will attempt to fish again within the treaty  limits, for it's dangerous work.\"    \"Yes,\" sais he, touching his nose with the point of his finger, \"all  these things are needed, and when they are going on, the mate and I  can attend to the business of the owners.\" He then looked cautiously  round to see that the captain was not within hearing.    \"Warn't it the 'Black Hawk' that was chased?\" said he. \"I think that  was our name then.\"    \"Why, to be sure it was,\" said I.    \"Well,\" sais he, \"this is the 'Sary Ann' of New Bedford now,\" and  proceeding aft he turned a screw, and I could hear a board shift in  the stern. \"Do you mind that?\" said he: \"well, you can't see it where  you stand just now at present; but the 'Sary Ann' shows her name there  now, and we have a set of papers to correspond. I guess the Britisher  can't seize her, because the 'Black Hawk' broke the treaty; can he?\"  And he gave a knowing jupe of his head, as much as to say, ain't that  grand?    \"Now our new captain is a strait-laced sort of man, you see; but the  cantin' fellow of a master you had on board before, warn't above a  dodge of this kind. If it comes to the scratch, you must take the  command again, for Cutler won't have art nor part in this game; and we  may be reformed out afore we know where we are.\"    \"Well,\" sais I, \"there is no occasion, I guess; put us somewhere a  little out of sight, and we won't break the treaty no more. I reckon  the 'Spitfire,' after all, would just as soon be in port as looking  after us. It's small potatoes for a man-of-war to be hunting poor  game, like us little fore and afters.\"    \"As you like,\" he said, \"but we are prepared, you see, for the mate  and men understand the whole thing. It ain't the first time they have  escaped by changing their sign-board.\"    \"Exactly,\" said I, \"a ship ain't like a dog that can only answer to  one name; and 'Sary Ann' is as good as the 'Black Hawk,' every mite  and morsel. There is a good deal of fun in altering sign-boards. I  recollect wunst, when I was a boy, there was a firm to Slickville who  had this sign over their shop:                                'Gallop and More,                                  Taylors.'      \"Well, one Saturday-night brother Josiah and I got a paintbrush, and  altered it in this way:                                'Gallop and 8 More                                   Taylors                                 Make a man.'      \"Lord, what a commotion it made. Next day was Sunday; and as the folks  were going to church, they stood and laughed and roared like anything.  It made a terrible hulla-bulloo.    \"'Sam,' said Minister to me, 'what in natur is all that ondecent noise  about so near the church-door.'    \"I told him. It was most too much for him, but he bit in his breath,  and tried to look grave; but I see a twinkle in his eye, and the  corner of his mouth twitch, the way your eyelid does sometimes when a  nerve gets a dancing involuntarily.    \"'A very foolish joke, Sam,' he said; 'it may get you into trouble.'    \"'Why, Minister,' said I, 'I hope you don't think that--'    \"'No,' said he, 'I don't think at all, I know it was you, for it's  just like you. But it's a foolish joke, for, Sam:                   \"'Honour and worth from no condition rise--'      \"'Exactly,' sais I.               \"'Stitch well your part, there all the honour lies.'      \"'Sam, Sam,' said he, 'you are a bad boy,' and he put on a serious  face, and went in and got his gown ready for service.    \"The 'Sary Ann' for the 'Black Hawk,'\" sais I to myself, \"well that  ain't bad either; but there are more chests of tea and kegs of brandy,  and such like, taken right by the custom-house door at Halifax in  loads of hay and straw, than comes by water, just because it is the  onlikeliest way in the world any man would do it. But it is only some  of the Bay of Fundy boys that are up to that dodge. Smugglers in  general haven't the courage to do that. Dear me!\" sais I to myself,  \"when was there ever a law that couldn't be evaded; a tax that  couldn't be shuffled off like an old slipper; a prohibition that a  smuggler couldn't row right straight through, or a treaty that hadn't  more holes in it than a dozen supplemental ones could patch up? It's a  high fence that can't be scaled, and a strong one that can't be broke  down. When there are accomplices in the house, it is easier to get the  door unlocked than to force it. Receivers make smugglers. Where there  are not informers, penalties are dead letters. The people here like to  see us, for it is their interest, and we are safe as long as they are  friendly. I don't want to smuggle, for I scorn such a pettifogin'  business, as Josiah would call it; but I must and will see how the  thing works, so as to report it to the President.\"    \"Well, Eldad,\" sais I, \"I leave all this to you. I want to avoid a  scrape if I can, so put us in a place of safety, and be careful how  you proceed.\"    \"I understand,\" said he. \"Now, Mr Slick, look yonder,\" pointing  towards the shore. \"What is that?\"    \"A large ship under full sail,\" said I, \"but it is curious she has got  the wind off shore, and just dead on end to us.\"    \"Are you sure,\" said he, \"it is a ship, for if we get foul of her, we  shall be sunk in a moment, and every soul on board perish.\"    \"Is it a cruiser?\" sais I; \"because if it is, steer boldly for her,  and I will go on board of her and show my commission as an officer of  our everlastin' nation. Captain,\" said I, \"what is that stranger?\"    He paused for a moment, shaded his eyes with his hand, and examined  her. \"A large square-rigged vessel,\" he said, \"under a heavy press of  canvas,\" and resumed his walk on the deck.    After a while the pilot said: \"Look again, Mr Slick, can you make her  out now?\"    \"Why,\" sais I, \"she is only a brigantine; but ask the skipper.\"    He took his glass and scrutinized her closely, and as he replaced it  in the binnacle said: \"We are going to have southerly weather I think;  she loomed very large when I first saw her, and I took her for a ship;  but now she seems to be an hermaphrodite. It's of no consequence to us  however what she is, and we shall soon near her.\"    \"Beyond that vessel,\" said the pilot, \"there is a splendid harbour,  and as there has been a head wind for some time, I have no doubt there  are many coasters in there, from the masters of whom you can obtain  much useful information on the object of your visit, while we can  drive a profitable trade among them and the folks ashore. How  beautifully these harbours are situated,\" he continued, \"for carrying  on the fisheries, and Nova Scotian though I be, I must say, I do think  in any other part of the world there would be large towns here.\"    \"I think so too, Eldad,\" sais I, \"but British legislation is at the  bottom of all your misfortunes, after all, and though you are as lazy  as sloths, and as idle as that fellow old Blowhard saw, who lay down  on the grass all day to watch the vessels passing, and observe the  motion of the crows, the English, by breaking up your monopoly of  inter-colonial and West India trade and throwing it open to us, not  only without an equivalent, but in the face of our prohibitory duties,  are the cause of all your poverty and stagnation. They are rich and  able to act like fools if they like in their own affairs, but it was a  cruel thing to sacrifice you, as they have done, and deprive you of  the only natural carrying trade and markets you had. The more I think  of it the less I blame you. It is a wicked mockery to lock men up, and  then taunt them with want of enterprise, and tell them they are idle.\"    \"Look at that vessel again, Sir,\" said Eldad; \"she don't make much  headway, does she?\"    \"Well, I took the glass again and examined her minutely, and I never  was so stumpt in my life.    \"Pilot,\" said I, \"is that the same vessel?\"    \"The identical,\" said he.    \"I vow to man,\" sais I, \"as I am a livin' sinner, that is neither a  ship, nor a brigantine, nor a hermaphrodite, but a topsail schooner,  that's a fact. What in natur' is the meanin' of all this? Perhaps the  captain knows,\" so I called him again.    \"Cutler, that vessel is transmografied again,\" sais I; \"look at her.\"    \"Pooh,\" said he, \"that's not the same vessel at all. The two first we  saw are behind that island. That one is nothing but a coaster. You  can't take me in, Slick. You are always full of your fun, and taking a  rise out of some one or another, and I shall be glad when we land, you  will then have some one else to practise on.\"    In a short time the schooner vanished, and its place was supplied by a  remarkable white cliff, which from the extraordinary optical delusion  it occasions gives its name to the noble port which is now called Ship  Harbour. I have since mentioned this subject to a number of mariners,  and have never yet heard of a person who was not deceived in a similar  manner. As we passed through the narrows, we entered a spacious and  magnificent basin, so completely land-locked that a fleet of vessels  of the largest size may lay there unmoved by any wind. There is no  haven in America to be compared with it.    \"You are now safe,\" said the pilot; \"it is only twelve leagues from  Halifax, and nobody would think of"]]]
