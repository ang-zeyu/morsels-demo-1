Ungrateful man!  have I not saved your land, and the lives of your sons and daughters, and  will you requite me thus?  Go, or it will be worse for you.'  But all the  men-at-arms drew their swords, and rushed on him like wild beasts.    Then he unveiled the Gorgon's head, and said, 'This has delivered my  bride from one wild beast: it shall deliver her from many.'  And as he  spoke Phineus and all his men-at-arms stopped short, and stiffened each  man as he stood; and before Perseus had drawn the goat-skin over the face  again, they were all turned into stone.    Then Perseus bade the people bring levers and roll them out; and what was  done with them after that I cannot tell.    So they made a great wedding-feast, which lasted seven whole days, and  who so happy as Perseus and Andromeda?    But on the eighth night Perseus dreamed a dream; and he saw standing  beside him Pallas Athene, as he had seen her in Seriphos, seven long  years before; and she stood and called him by name, and said--    'Perseus, you have played the man, and see, you have your reward.  Know  now that the Gods are just, and help him who helps himself.  Now give me  here Herpe the sword, and the sandals, and the hat of darkness, that I  may give them back to their owners; but the Gorgon's head you shall keep  a while, for you will need it in your land of Greece.  Then you shall lay  it up in my temple at Seriphos, that I may wear it on my shield for ever,  a terror to the Titans and the monsters, and the foes of Gods and men.  And as for this land, I have appeased the sea and the fire, and there  shall be no more floods nor earthquakes.  But let the people build altars  to Father Zeus, and to me, and worship the Immortals, the Lords of heaven  and earth.'    And Perseus rose to give her the sword, and the cap, and the sandals; but  he woke, and his dream vanished away.  And yet it was not altogether a  dream; for the goat-skin with the head was in its place; but the sword,  and the cap, and the sandals were gone, and Perseus never saw them more.    Then a great awe fell on Perseus; and he went out in the morning to the  people, and told his dream, and bade them build altars to Zeus, the  Father of Gods and men, and to Athene, who gives wisdom to heroes; and  fear no more the earthquakes and the floods, but sow and build in peace.  And they did so for a while, and prospered; but after Perseus was gone  they forgot Zeus and Athene, and worshipped again Atergatis the queen,  and the undying fish of the sacred lake, where Deucalion's deluge was  swallowed up, and they burnt their children before the Fire King, till  Zeus was angry with that foolish people, and brought a strange nation  against them out of Egypt, who fought against them and wasted them  utterly, and dwelt in their cities for many a hundred years.        PART V  HOW PERSEUS CAME HOME AGAIN      And when a year was ended Perseus hired Phoenicians from Tyre, and cut  down cedars, and built himself a noble galley; and painted its cheeks  with vermilion, and pitched its sides with pitch; and in it he put  Andromeda, and all her dowry of jewels, and rich shawls, and spices from  the East; and great was the weeping when they rowed away.  But the  remembrance of his brave deed was left behind; and Andromeda's rock was  shown at Iopa in Palestine till more than a thousand years were past.    So Perseus and the Phoenicians rowed to the westward, across the sea of  Crete, till they came to the blue AEgean and the pleasant Isles of  Hellas, and Seriphos, his ancient home.    Then he left his galley on the beach, and went up as of old; and he  embraced his mother, and Dictys his good foster-father, and they wept  over each other a long while, for it was seven years and more since they  had met.    Then Perseus went out, and up to the hall of Polydectes; and underneath  the goat-skin he bore the Gorgon's head.    And when he came into the hall, Polydectes sat at the table-head, and all  his nobles and landowners on either side, each according to his rank,  feasting on the fish and the goat's flesh, and drinking the blood-red  wine.  The harpers harped, and the revellers shouted, and the wine-cups  rang merrily as they passed from hand to hand, and great was the noise in  the hall of Polydectes.    Then Perseus stood upon the threshold, and called to the king by name.  But none of the guests knew Perseus, for he was changed by his long  journey.  He had gone out a boy, and he was come home a hero; his eye  shone like an eagle's, and his beard was like a lion's beard, and he  stood up like a wild bull in his pride.    But Polydectes the wicked knew him, and hardened his heart still more;  and scornfully he called--    'Ah, foundling! have you found it more easy to promise than to fulfil?'    'Those whom the Gods help fulfil their promises; and those who despise  them, reap as they have sown.  Behold the Gorgon's head!'    Then Perseus drew back the goat-skin, and held aloft the Gorgon's head.    Pale grew Polydectes and his guests as they looked upon that dreadful  face.  They tried to rise up from their seats: but from their seats they  never rose, but stiffened, each man where he sat, into a ring of cold  gray stones.    Then Perseus turned and left them, and went down to his galley in the  bay; and he gave the kingdom to good Dictys, and sailed away with his  mother and his bride.    And Polydectes and his guests sat still, with the wine-cups before them  on the board, till the rafters crumbled down above their heads, and the  walls behind their backs, and the table crumbled down between them, and  the grass sprung up about their feet: but Polydectes and his guests sit  on the hillside, a ring of gray stones until this day.    But Perseus rowed westward toward Argos, and landed, and went up to the  town.  And when he came, he found that Acrisius his grandfather had fled.  For Proetus his wicked brother had made war against him afresh; and had  come across the river from Tiryns, and conquered Argos, and Acrisius had  fled to Larissa, in the country of the wild Pelasgi.    Then Perseus called the Argives together, and told them who he was, and  all the noble deeds which he had done.  And all the nobles and the yeomen  made him king, for they saw that he had a royal heart; and they fought  with him against Argos, and took it, and killed Proetus, and made the  Cyclopes serve them, and build them walls round Argos, like the walls  which they had built at Tiryns; and there were great rejoicings in the  vale of Argos, because they had got a king from Father Zeus.    But Perseus' heart yearned after his grandfather, and he said, 'Surely he  is my flesh and blood, and he will love me now that I am come home with  honour: I will go and find him, and bring him home, and we will reign  together in peace.'    So Perseus sailed away with his Phoenicians, round Hydrea and Sunium,  past Marathon and the Attic shore, and through Euripus, and up the long  Euboean sea, till he came to the town of Larissa, where the wild Pelasgi  dwelt.    And when he came there, all the people were in the fields, and there was  feasting, and all kinds of games; for Teutamenes their king wished to  honour Acrisius, because he was the king of a mighty land.    So Perseus did not tell his name, but went up to the games unknown; for  he said, 'If I carry away the prize in the games, my grandfather's heart  will be softened toward me.'    So he threw off his helmet, and his cuirass, and all his clothes, and  stood among the youths of Larissa, while all wondered at him, and said,  'Who is this young stranger, who stands like a wild bull in his pride?  Surely he is one of the heroes, the sons of the Immortals, from Olympus.'    And when the games began, they wondered yet more; for Perseus was the  best man of all at running, and leaping, and wrestling and throwing the  javelin; and he won four crowns, and took them, and then he said to  himself, 'There is a fifth crown yet to be won: I will win that, and lay  them all upon the knees of my grandfather.'    And as he spoke, he saw where Acrisius sat, by the side of Teutamenes the  king, with his white beard flowing down upon his knees, and his royal  staff in his hand; and Perseus wept when he looked at him, for his heart  yearned after his kin; and he said, 'Surely he is a kingly old man, yet  he need not be ashamed of his grandson.'    Then he took the quoits, and hurled them, five fathoms beyond all the  rest; and the people shouted, 'Further yet, brave stranger!  There has  never been such a hurler in this land.'    Then Perseus put out all his strength, and hurled.  But a gust of wind  came from the sea, and carried the quoit aside, and far beyond all the  rest; and it fell on the foot of Acrisius, and he swooned away with the  pain.    Perseus shrieked, and ran up to him; but when they lifted the old man up  he was dead, for his life was slow and feeble.    Then Perseus rent his clothes, and cast dust upon his head, and wept a  long while for his grandfather.  At last he rose, and called to all the  people aloud, and said--    'The Gods are true, and what they have ordained must be.  I am Perseus,  the grandson of this dead man, the far-famed slayer of the Gorgon.'    Then he told them how the prophecy had declared that he should kill his  grandfather, and all the story of his life.    So they made a great mourning for Acrisius, and burnt him on a right rich  pile; and Perseus went to the temple, and was purified from the guilt of  the death, because he had done it unknowingly.    Then he went home to Argos, and reigned there well with fair Andromeda;  and they had four sons and three daughters, and died in a good old age.    And when they died, the ancients say, Athene took them up into the sky,  with Cepheus and Cassiopoeia.  And there on starlight nights you may see  them shining still; Cepheus with his kingly crown, and Cassiopoeia in her  ivory chair,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6782"],[0,"The Robbers (#8)"],[1,"saw that miserable wretch, Amelia, in our  hospital, who was heavily breathing out his spirit; modesty seemed to  cast down her abashed eye as she passed him; you cried woe upon him.  Recall that hideous image to your mind, and your Charles stands before  you. His kisses are pestilence, his lips poison.    AMELIA (strikes him). Shameless liar!    FRANCIS. Does such a Charles inspire you with horror? Does the mere  picture fill you with disgust? Go, then! gaze upon him yourself, your  handsome, your angelic, your divine Charles! Go, drink his balmy  breath, and revel in the ambrosial fumes which ascend from his throat!  The very exhalations of his body will plunge you into that dark and  deathlike dizziness which follows the smell of a bursting carcase, or  the sight of a corpse-strewn battle-field. (AMELIA turns away her  face.) What sensations of love! What rapture in those embraces! But is  it not unjust to condemn a man because of his diseased exterior? Even  in the most wretched lump of deformity a soul great and worthy of love  may beam forth brightly like a pearl on a dunghill. ( With a malignant  smile.) Even from lips of corruption love may----. To be sure if vice  should undermine the very foundations of character, if with chastity  virtue too should take her flight as the fragrance departs from the  faded rose--if with the body the soul too should be tainted and  corrupted.    AMELIA (rising joyfully). Ha! Charles! now I recognize thee again!  Thou art whole, whole! It was all a lie! Dost thou not know,  miscreant, that it would be impossible for Charles to be the being you  describe? (FRANCIS remains standing for some time, lost in thought,  then suddenly turns round to go away.) Whither are you going in such  haste? Are you flying from your own infamy?    FRANCIS (hiding his face). Let me go, let me go! to give free vent to  my tears! tyrannical father, thus to abandon the best of your sons to  misery and disgrace on every side! Let me go, Amelia! I will throw  myself at his feet, on my knees I will conjure him to transfer to me the  curse that he has pronounced, to disinherit me, to hate me, my blood, my  life, my all----.    AMELIA (falls on his neck). Brother of my Charles! Dearest, most  excellent Francis!    FRANCIS. Oh, Amelia! how I love you for this unshaken constancy to my  brother. Forgive me for venturing to subject your love to so severe a  trial! How nobly you have realized my wishes! By those tears, those  sighs, that divine indignation--and for me too, for me--our souls did so  truly harmonize.    AMELIA. Oh, no! that they never did!    FRANCIS. Alas! they harmonized so truly that I always thought we must  be twins. And were it not for that unfortunate difference in person, to  be twin-like, which, it must be admitted, would be to the disadvantage  of Charles, we should again and again be mistaken for each other. Thou  art, I often said to myself, thou art the very Charles, his echo, his  counterpart.    AMELIA (shakes her head). No, no! by that chaste light of heaven! not  an atom of him, not the least spark of his soul.    FRANCIS. So entirely the same in our dispositions; the rose was his  favorite flower, and what flower do I esteem above the rose? He loved  music beyond expression; and ye are witnesses, ye stars! how often you  have listened to me playing on the harpsichord in the dead silence of  night, when all around lay buried in darkness and slumber; and how is it  possible for you, Amelia, still to doubt? if our love meets in one  perfection, and if it is the self-same love, how can its fruits  degenerate? (AMELIA looks at him with astonishment.) It was a calm,  serene evening, the last before his departure for Leipzic, when he took  me with him to the bower where you so often sat together in dreams of  love,--we were long speechless; at last he seized my hand, and said, in  a low voice, and with tears in his eyes, \"I am leaving Amelia; I know  not, but I have a sad presentiment that it is forever; forsake her not,  brother; be her friend, her Charles--if Charles--should never--never  return.\" (He throws himself down before her, and kisses her hand with  fervor.) Never, never, never will he return; and I stand pledged by a  sacred oath to fulfil his behest!    AMELIA (starting back). Traitor! Now thou art unmasked! In that very  bower he conjured me, if he died, to admit no other love. Dost thou see  how impious, how execrable----. Quit my sight!    FRANCIS. You know me not, Amelia; you do not know me in the least!    AMELIA. Oh, yes, I know you; from henceforth I know you; and you  pretend to be like him? You mean to say that he wept for me in your  presence? Yours? He would sooner have inscribed my name on the  pillory? Begone--this instant!    FRANCIS. You insult me.    AMELIA. Go--I say. You have robbed me of a precious hour; may it be  deducted from your life.    FRANCIS. You hate me then!    AMELIA. I despise you--away!    FRANCIS (stamping with fury). Only wait! you shall learn to tremble  before me!--To sacrifice me for a beggar!                        [Exit in anger.]    AMELIA. Go, thou base villain! Now, Charles, am I again thine own.  Beggar, did he say! then is the world turned upside down, beggars are  kings, and kings are beggars! I would not change the rags he wears for  the imperial purple. The look with which he begs must, indeed, be a  noble, a royal look, a look that withers into naught the glory, the  pomp, the triumphs of the rich and great! Into the dust with thee,  glittering baubles! (She tears her pearls from her neck.) Let the rich  and the proud be condemned to bear the burden of gold, and silver, and  jewels! Be they condemned to carouse at the tables of the voluptuous!  To pamper their limbs on the downy couch of luxury! Charles! Charles!  Thus am I worthy of thee!                        [Exit.]                           ACT II.        SCENE I.--FRANCIS VON MOOR in his chamber--in meditation.    FRANCIS. It lasts too long-and the doctor even says is recovering--an  old man's life is a very eternity! The course would be free and plain  before me, but for this troublesome, tough lump of flesh, which, like  the infernal demon-hound in ghost stories, bars the way to my treasures.    Must, then, my projects bend to the iron yoke of a mechanical system?  Is my soaring spirit to be chained down to the snail's pace of matter?  To blow out a wick which is already flickering upon its last drop of  oil--'tis nothing more. And yet I would rather not do it myself, on  account of what the world would say. I should not wish him to be  killed, but merely disposed of. I should like to do what your clever  physician does, only the reverse way--not stop Nature's course by  running a bar across her path, but only help her to speed a little  faster. Are we not able to prolong the conditions of life? Why,  then, should we not also be able to shorten them? Philosophers and  physiologists teach us how close is the sympathy between the emotions of  the mind and the movements of the bodily machine. Convulsive sensations  are always accompanied by a disturbance of the mechanical vibrations--  passions injure the vital powers--an overburdened spirit bursts its  shell. Well, then--what if one knew how to smooth this unbeaten path,  for the easier entrance of death into the citadel of life?--to work the  body's destruction through the mind--ha! an original device!--who can  accomplish this?--a device without a parallel! Think upon it, Moor!  That were an art worthy of thee for its inventor. Has not poisoning  been raised almost to the rank of a regular science, and Nature  compelled, by the force of experiments, to define her limits, so that  one may now calculate the heart's throbbings for years in advance, and  say to the beating pulse, \"So far, and no farther\"? Why should not one  try one's skill in this line?*       *[A woman in Paris, by means of a regularly performed series of     experiments, carried the art of poisoning to such perfection that     she could predict almost to a certainty the day of death, however     remote. Fie upon our physicians, who should blush to be outdone by     a woman in their own province. Beckmann, in his article on secret     poisoning, has given a particular account of this woman, the     Marchioness de Brinvilliers.--See \"History of Inventions,\" Standard     Library Edition, vol. i, pp. 47-63.]    And how, then, must I, too, go to work to dissever that sweet and  peaceful union of soul and body? What species of sensations should I  seek to produce? Which would most fiercely assail the condition of  life? Anger?--that ravenous wolf is too quickly satiated. Care? that  worm gnaws far too slowly. Grief?--that viper creeps too lazily for me.  Fear?--hope destroys its power. What! and are these the only  executioners of man? is the armory of death so soon exhausted? (In deep  thought.) How now! what! ho! I have it! (Starting up.) Terror! What  is proof against terror? What powers have religion and reason under  that giant's icy grasp! And yet--if he should withstand even this  assault? If he should! Oh, then, come Anguish to my aid! and thou,  gnawing Repentance!--furies of hell, burrowing snakes who regorge your  food, and feed upon your own excrements; ye that are forever destroying,  and forever reproducing your poison! And thou, howling Remorse, that  desolatest thine own habitation, and feedest upon thy mother. And come  ye, too, gentle Graces, to my aid; even you, sweet smiling Memory,  goddess of the past--and thou, with thy overflowing horn of plenty,  blooming Futurity; show him in your mirror the joys of Paradise, while  with fleeting foot you elude his eager grasp. Thus will I work my  battery of death, stroke after stroke, upon his fragile body, until the  troop of furies close upon him with Despair! Triumph! triumph!--the  plan is complete--difficult and masterly beyond compare--sure--safe; for  then (with a sneer) the"]]]
