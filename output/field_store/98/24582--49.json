The reader will doubtless bear it in mind, since with it is connected  one of the most startling episodes of Jack Harkaway's history, in his  voyage round the world with young Jack.    It was at the hotel in New York that the Harkaways first met with  Sunday, too, for here they were the means of rescuing him from the  brutal violence of the ruffian Toro.    It was, in fact, this which led up to that scene of terror--the firing  of the hotel by Hunston and Toro.    Sunday had suffered at Toro's hands, but had never had his whack back.    But now the darkey showed the half insensible Italian the full  signification of \"John up de orchard,\" and likewise of \"what for,\" and  \"what Paddy gave the drum.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hunston and Toro were thrown into prison, with the few brigands  captured and their discomfited chieftain Mathias.    Such was the end of their exploit.    When once they were in prison, however, it required some exertion on  the part of the authorities to keep them there.    The gang were unceasing in their endeavours to release them.    Artifices of every kind were tried to accomplish it, but the Harkaways  had foreseen that no stone would be left unturned by the murderous  friends of the captured robbers; and they knew the good old-fashioned  saying--\"forewarned, forearmed.'\"    The prison in which they we re confined was situated at the waterside,  and it was approachable by boat, where the entrance was beneath a low,  vaulted archway.    The day after the capture of the notorious robbers, a poor cripple  hobbled up to the porter's lodge, dragging himself painfully along by  the aid of a stick in one hand and a crutch under his other arm.    \"Move off,\" said the porter gruffly; \"we have nothing to give away  here.\"    \"I don't ask your charity,\" replied the cripple humbly; \"accept this,  good sir, as a peace offering.\"    And then, to the porter's surprise, he dropped a coin into his hand.    The porter looked hard at the coin in his hand, and then at the  cripple.    He was a man of no sentiment, this porter, and so he asked the generous  donor bluntly what he wanted for the money.    \"I only want you to show some consideration and kindness, if possible,  to some of the unfortunate inmates of this place,\" was the reply.    \"Prisoners?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"If you expect that,\" said the porter \"you had better take back your  money, for I have nothing to do with the prisoners.\"    The cripple looked grave, and he muttered to himself--    \"This fool is beastly conscientious. If he had only proved a bit of a  rogue, there was a chance--the ass!\"    But he did not mean to yield the point yet.    \"You are a very good man,\" he said to the porter, \"a worthy honest  fellow, and you will know that I don't mean to offer you any thing like  a bribe.\"    The porter started.    \"A bribe!\" he said, with an expletive. \"You had better not.\"    \"Ahem!\" coughed the cripple. \"My friend, I have confined in this prison  my son, a poor misguided boy--\"    \"They are mostly that,\" said the porter shortly.    \"But he is innocent.\"    \"They are all innocent,\" said the porter.    \"All?\"    \"According to their own showing.\"    \"But my boy is.\"    \"No doubt\"    \"And I only want to beg you to do what you can to soften his lot--a  hard lot it is, too.\"    \"I can do nothing, I tell you,\" said the porter; \"I never see the  prisoners.\"    \"I thought--\"    \"At least, when I say never, I mean only when they are allowed to walk  in the prison yard.\"    \"That is here?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"When is that?\"    \"Once a day; sometimes more than that, if the doctor orders it.\"    \"The doctor must order it, then?\" said the cripple to himself.    \"What is your son in for?\" asked the porter.    \"For an unfortunate resemblance he bears to a notorious brigand.\"    \"Bah!\" exclaimed the porter. \"They don't imprison a man for being like  another.\"    \"Yes, they do; my unlucky son has been taken for Mathias the brigand.\"    \"What,\" ejaculated the doorkeeper, \"do you mean that Mathias is not  Mathias?\"    \"I mean that my son has been taken for Mathias, to whom, indeed, he is  so like that nothing but the capture of the real culprit can save my  son.\"    The doorkeeper eyed the cripple sharply.    But the latter stood it coolly enough.    \"Well,\" said the door porter, \"if that is the case, it is certainly a  very hard job for your son. What do you want me to do for him? I can't  let him out.\"    \"My friend,\" exclaimed the cripple, \"think you I would suggest such a  thing? No, all I would ask of you is to soothe him with a kind word.\"    \"I'll tell him when next he comes out.\"    \"At what time did you say?\" asked the cripple, looking on the ground as  though he only put the question casually.    \"At twelve.\"    The cripple's eyes glistened as he heard this.    \"Well, well,\" he said, pressing some more money into the door porter's  hand, \"I'll call again, and perhaps you may have seen my boy, and  comforted him with the assurance that I'll save him, in spite of all  the ill these accursed English people can work by the aid of their  money.\"    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said the porter. \"The English are at work in  it, eh?\"    \"Yes. They owe him some spite, and money, you know, can buy any  thing--any thing.\" And blessing the gatekeeper, he hobbled off.           *       *       *       *       *    Near the prison he overtook a blind man begging by the roadside, and  while stopping to drop a coin in his hat, the cripple contrived to  whisper a few hurried words to this effect--    \"I have made a step--almost made a breach in the fortress.\"    \"You have!\"    And the blind man turned his head to the right and to the left, almost  as though looking out to see if they were unwatched.    \"Yes; the prison yard is only the other side of the gate. Now that gate  is kept by a porter who is already in our interest.\"    \"Good, good, Tomaso!\" quoth the blind man.    \"Now, listen.\"    \"Go on,\" returned the blind man, in an eager tone.    \"At noon the prisoners are in the yard. If we could but get that gate  open for an instant, and have our men ready hereabouts for a rush--\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Who can tell what may happen?\"    \"Good again--good again! ha, ha, ha! that's brave, that is. Why, the  mob of idle sightseers who crowd about the prison gates at noon to  watch the prisoners might all be poor blind wretches or helpless  cripples like you and I.\"    \"Of course.\"    \"And if the gate is left open but one instant--a single inch, no  more--why, worlds might be done.\"    \"A horse ready saddled near at hand might be worth thinking of.\"    \"True.\"    \"And a small keg of gunpowder blown up under the archway by the  waterside entrance would divert attention.\"    \"Tomaso,\" ejaculated the blind man, \"you're born to be a captain of  brigands some day!\"          CHAPTER VII.    HOW TOMASO HELPED HIS FRIENDS IN TROUBLE--THE SKIRMISH IN THE  PRISON--MATHIAS THE BRIGAND.      Tomaso, before the day was over, changed his garments and abandoned  crutch and stick, and when he turned out with flaxen-dyed hair and  spectacles, and presented himself at the other great entrance of the  prison, as a German traveller who desired to go over the place, no one  could possibly have imagined it to be the old cripple whose paternal  lamentation had so touched the doorkeeper's heart.    \"You have got here a notorious brigand, as I have heard tell,\" said the  visitor.    \"We have, sir,\" was the governor's reply; \"a very remarkable man he is,  too.\"    \"Ah, so I have heard,\" said the visitor. \"He is called Demetrius, I  believe?\"    \"Nay; his name is Mathias.\"    The visitor looked surprised at this information.    \"Mathias--Mathias!\" he repeated to himself. \"I was misinformed, then. I  certainly thought that his name was Demetrius.\"    The governor smiled.    \"You may be right, all the same,\" said he.    \"How so?\"    \"Why, Mathias is but his avowed name; he may be known by a dozen  different _aliases_.\"    \"Is it possible?\" ejaculated the sham German traveller.    \"Indeed it is. These robbers are mostly adepts at disguise. Would you  like to see this Mathias?\" demanded the governor, courteously.    \"Vastly.\"    \"Well, sir, I'll only warn you of one thing.\"    \"Indeed! What is it?\"    \"A disappointment awaits you in this.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Instead of seeing a ferocious fellow, such as you might expect,  Mathias is really a very pleasant and innocent-looking man.\"    The governor of the prison then led the visitors through the long stone  corridors of the place where Mathias was confined.    They stopped before a door of great thickness, heavily barred, and  studded with iron bolts and nails.    The governor tapped at a small grated trap in the door, and it was  pulled aside.    At the grating a broad-shouldered fellow appeared, who touched his cap  at the visitors.    \"So that is Mathias,\" said the German gentleman.    \"No, no,\" said the governor; \"that is the gaoler who is shut up with  him.\"    \"What for?\"    \"So that he might be watched night and day; the authorities have doomed  him to--\"    \"To what?\"    \"To death,\" replied the governor, in a low but impressive voice.    \"He is young.\"    \"In years, yes,\" answered the governor, \"but old in crime. This man has  been guilty of nearly every crime under the sun--brigandage is one of  his least offences. His last exploit, however, is the worst.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"Murder.\"    \"Murder!\"    And the German traveller looked inexpressibly shocked.    \"Murder is a capital crime in every land.\"    \"And rightly too,\" said the visitor, \"rightly, too. But, sir, excuse my  curiosity--\"    \"Ask all you will,\" returned the governor.    \"This man had, I was told, a bold, dashing fellow to second him in all  his exploits.\"    \"An Italian?\"    \"No.\"    \"An Englishman?\"    \"No, no, sir, you mistake; I mean a Greek--a handsome, dashing  fellow--a great favourite with the ladies--brave and daring.\"    \"And how is this Apollo called?\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7346"],[0,"Among Malay Pirates : a Tale of Adventure and Peril (#8)"],[1," he made his way forward,  and joined Harry, telling the men to pull the boat forward by means  of the branches overhead which were well within reach, but to avoid  breaking even a twig.    In a minute or two the bow of the boat arrived at the end of the screen  of bushes, and a low exclamation broke from the lieutenant and Harry  simultaneously; they were looking out on to an almost circular pool some  two hundred yards in diameter. In the center were moored six prahus.  Two of them lay broadside on to the creek, the other four were in a line  behind these, and it seemed that their broadsides were directed to the  opposite side of the pool, for the other two boats were in the way of  their firing at the creek. They were long, low vessels, rowing some  twenty oars on each side. Each carried a number of small brass guns, and  they were evidently full of men, for numbers could be seen on deck, and  boats were passing to and fro between them and a small village at the  edge of the pool. Having taken in all the details of the scene, the  lieutenant passed the word for the mate to leave his own boat and join  him. When he did so, he whispered to him: \"I thought it was as well that  you should have a view of these fellows' position too, Morrison, as it  would be of use to you if you have to take a boat in to attack them.\"    Two minutes later the boats were drawn back again to the open water in  their rear, and rowed as noiselessly as before down the creek, no word  being spoken until they were half a mile away from the pool.    \"That is a snug hiding place, Mr. Morrison,\" the lieutenant said.    \"It is indeed, sir. Who would have thought the scoundrels were so close  to us, or that they lay up this narrow creek, which I have passed half a  dozen times and never thought worth examining? I should not have dreamt  that one of those craft could have passed through.\"    \"I doubt whether they did pass through. They hardly could have done so  without breaking down a good many of these branches, and we must have  seen signs of that. I think they must have got into that pool by some  creek coming in on the opposite side. You see four out of the six boats  were anchored in line so as to bring their broadsides to bear on some  point opposite to them, while the other two guarded them against any  attack from this side. Naturally, they thought it unlikely that any boat  would come up here, and so directed their main attention to the other  opening. The next thing to find out will be where the other stream  joins the river, otherwise, as soon as we make our appearance, they will  escape that way, and there is not the least doubt that they could row  away from our fastest boats. However, it is a great thing that we have  discovered their whereabouts without their having the least notion that  we have done so, and I am sure the captain will be very pleased when he  hears that we have found them. It will give him the whip hand over that  lying rascal Sehi.\"    Captain Forest smiled grimly when the lieutenant made his report of the  discovery that he had made.    \"Thank you, Mr. Hopkins; that is a very valuable discovery. Just at  present matters have not come to a point when we can turn it to account.  The next thing will be to find out where the other passage comes out.  It will be a serious business to attack them in the boats alone;  these prahus carry a tremendous lot of men, and the Malays will fight  desperately. I do not say that we might not succeed, but we should lose  a lot of men in the attempt; it would be hot work even with the ship,  attacked by six of these fellows at once. If it was in the night, we  might fail to see any of them before they were upon us, and we should  have hard work to beat back four or five hundred of them if they all  came swarming on deck together. However, we can wait, and the first time  the rajah shows any signs of treachery we can pounce upon his fleet.  He will not dream that we have discovered their hiding place, and will  therefore let them hide there without movement. However, we must try to  find the ether end of the entrance to the creek.    \"Please impress upon Mr. Morrison and young Parkhurst that it is of the  highest importance no words shall be spoken about it; and it might be  advisable, also, to give notice to the men who were in the boats, to  keep their mouths shut. I have no reason to believe that the interpreter  is not faithful to our interests, but it is just as well not to trust  anyone. Moreover, it may be that some of these Malays who come on board  with fruit may have been for a time at Singapore or Penang, and picked  up a little English, and a chance word might let them know that we have  discovered the prahus.\"    \"I wonder why our friend Hassan has not turned up,\" Dick Balderson said  to his chum one day, after they had been lying for a month opposite the  town.    \"I expect something has occurred to keep him,\" Harry said. \"I am quite  convinced that he would have come if he could. He may be in trouble  himself with some of his neighbors, or he may have tried to exert  himself too soon and done himself damage. I am quite convinced that  he meant what he said. At any rate, till this business here comes to a  head, we are not likely to be able to go up and pay a visit to him.\"    \"No, I am quite sure that the captain would not let us go now, and  indeed, I would not ask him, even if I were sure he would, for we may  get to blows with the rajah any day; he cannot put off giving a final  answer much longer. I wonder the captain stood his shilly shallying so  long as he has.\"    It was but two evenings after this that, as the two midshipmen were  leaning against the bulwarks, watching the reflection of the stars in  the sluggish stream, a native sampan stole silently out from the shadow  of the shore and dropped down alongside the Serpent. So noiseless was  the movement that the two men on the lookout in the bow did not notice  it, and the midshipmen thought it was a shadow of some dark object  floating down stream, when it came alongside and a man stood up.    \"Hello!\" Harry said, \"you must not come alongside like this: what do you  want?\"    \"Dick, Harry, Doctor; come from Hassan.\"    \"Oh, that is it; all right, come on board,\" and, leaning over, he  stretched out his hand to the native, who seized it, and in a moment  stood by his side on the deck, holding the head rope of his sampan in  his mouth.    \"Davis,\" Harry said to the sailor who was standing two paces away, \"just  go down to the wardroom, and tell the doctor, with my compliments,  that I shall be obliged if he will come on deck at once. Say that it is  something particular.\"    A minute later the doctor appeared. \"I was just in the middle of a  rubber, Dick, and if you have not an uncommonly good reason for calling  me up I will make you smart for it, the first time you get under my  hands. Whom have we got here?\"    \"He is a messenger from Hassan; he mentioned our names and yours.\"    \"Ah, I am glad of that,\" the doctor said, rubbing his hands together;  \"they have been chaffing me in the wardroom about it, and prophesying  that I should never hear of him again. Well, what does he say?\"    \"He has not said anything except our names, Doctor, and that he comes  from Hassan. I don't suppose he knows any more English, and I thought we  had better consult you, whether it would be best to send for Soh Hay; he  may have brought some message of importance.\"    \"Right, lad. I think the most prudent thing will be to tell the captain  first. It may only be a message to say why he has not come, or it may be  a matter of some importance. I will go to him at once.\"    Two or three minutes later he returned. \"You are to bring him to the  captain's cabin. Here, Davis, pass the word forward that the captain  wants to see Soh Hay in his cabin.\"    Harry touched the native, who had been standing quietly by his side, and  signed him to accompany them, and with Dr. Horsley and Dick went direct  to the cabin.    \"So your friend has sent a message at last, lad?\" Captain Forest said.  \"I am glad of that, for I own that I had doubts whether we should hear  any more of him.\"    \"You come from the chief Hassan?\" the captain, who had been working at  the Malay language, with the interpreter, since he had arrived at the  mouth of the river, asked in that tongue. The man's face brightened.    \"Yes, my lord,\" he said.    \"Is he well?\"    \"The chief is quite well.\"    \"I wish I knew enough to question him without Soh Hay's interference,  but I shall only make a mess of it, and, perhaps, get a wrong  idea altogether of his message. Now, Soh Hay,\" he broke off as the  interpreter entered, \"you will ask this man the questions exactly as I  put them, and tell me his answer word for word. It may be of importance.  Now ask him first what message he brings from his chief to the  officers.\"    The question was put, and the native, speaking slowly and quietly, and  evidently repeating a lesson that he had learned by heart, said, \"The  chief sends his greeting to his three friends, Harry, Dick, and Doctor,  also to Captain. He is well in body; he is cured, and can throw a  spear and lead his men to battle. He has sent four messengers one after  another, but none have returned with an answer; they have no doubt been  krised. Now he sends me.\"    \"Tell him that no messenger has arrived until now,\" the captain said,  when this was interpreted to him.    The man nodded. \"All krised. I travel at night, hide in trees all day,  float down at night in shadow of bushes, and have got through safe.  Chief Hassan says not been able to come down. Other chiefs very angry  because English warship come. Send message to Hassan to join them. When  he say no, they threaten to kill him and destroy tribe when warship go  away. Two of Rajah Sehi's prahus go up and down river; stop all boats.  Sehi send message to all chiefs; say that English war boat here. English"]]]
