He  had only one thought--to follow Nello. A human friend might have paused  for the pleasant meal, the cheery warmth, the cosey slumber; but that  was not the friendship of Patrasche. He remembered a bygone time, when  an old man and a little child had found him sick unto death in the  wayside ditch.    Snow had fallen freshly all the evening long; it was now nearly ten; the  trail of the boy's footsteps was almost obliterated. It took Patrasche  long to discover any scent. When at last he found it, it was lost again  quickly, and lost and recovered, and again lost and again recovered, a  hundred times or more.    The night was very wild. The lamps under the wayside crosses were blown  out; the roads were sheets of ice; the impenetrable darkness hid every  trace of habitations; there was no living thing abroad. All the cattle  were housed, and in all the huts and homesteads men and women rejoiced  and feasted. There was only Patrasche out in the cruel cold--old and  famished and full of pain, but with the strength and the patience of a  great love to sustain him in his search.    The trail of Nello's steps, faint and obscure as it was under the new  snow, went straightly along the accustomed tracks into Antwerp. It was  past midnight when Patrasche traced it over the boundaries of the town  and into the narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It was all quite dark in  the town, save where some light gleamed ruddily through the crevices  of house-shutters, or some group went homeward with lanterns chanting  drinking-songs. The streets were all white with ice: the high walls and  roofs loomed black against them. There was scarce a sound save the riot  of the winds down the passages as they tossed the creaking signs and  shook the tall lamp-irons.    [Illustration: The portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the  Midnight Mass]    So many passers-by had trodden through and through the snow, so many  diverse paths had crossed and recrossed each other, that the dog had a  hard task to retain any hold on the track he followed. But he kept on  his way, though the cold pierced him to the bone, and the jagged ice cut  his feet, and the hunger in his body gnawed like a rat's teeth. He kept  on his way, a poor gaunt, shivering thing, and by long patience traced  the steps he loved into the very heart of the burgh and up to the steps  of the great cathedral.    \"He is gone to the things that he loved,\" thought Patrasche: he  could not understand, but he was full of sorrow and of pity for the  art-passion that to him was so incomprehensible and yet so sacred.    The portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the midnight mass. Some  heedlessness in the custodians, too eager to go home and feast or sleep,  or too drowsy to know whether they turned the keys aright, had left one  of the doors unlocked. By that accident the foot-falls Patrasche sought  had passed through into the building, leaving the white marks of snow  upon the dark stone floor. By that slender white thread, frozen as it  fell, he was guided through the intense silence, through the immensity  of the vaulted space--guided straight to the gates of the chancel, and,  stretched there upon the stones, he found Nello. He crept up and touched  the face of the boy. \"Didst thou dream that I should be faithless and  forsake thee? I--a dog?\" said that mute caress.    The lad raised himself with a low cry and clasped him close. \"Let us lie  down and die together,\" he murmured. \"Men have no need of us, and we are  all alone.\"    In answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, and laid his head upon the young  boy's breast. The great tears stood in his brown, sad eyes: not for  himself--for himself he was happy.    They lay close together in the piercing cold. The blasts that blew over  the Flemish dikes from the northern seas were like waves of ice, which  froze every living thing they touched. The interior of the immense  vault of stone in which they were was even more bitterly chill than  the snow-covered plains without. Now and then a bat moved in the  shadows--now and then a gleam of light came on the ranks of carven  figures. Under the Rubens they lay together quite still, and soothed  almost into a dreaming slumber by the numbing narcotic of the cold.  Together they dreamed of the old glad days when they had chased each  other through the flowering grasses of the summer meadows, or sat hidden  in the tall bulrushes by the water's side, watching the boats go seaward  in the sun.    Suddenly through the darkness a great white radiance streamed through  the vastness of the aisles; the moon, that was at her height, had broken  through the clouds, the snow had ceased to fall, the light reflected  from the snow without was clear as the light of dawn. It fell through  the arches full upon the two pictures above, from which the boy on his  entrance had flung back the veil: the Elevation and the Descent of the  Cross were for one instant visible.    Nello rose to his feet and stretched his arms to them; the tears of a  passionate ecstasy glistened on the paleness of his face. \"I have seen  them at last!\" he cried aloud. \"O God, it is enough!\"    His limbs failed under him, and he sank upon his knees, still gazing  upward at the majesty that he adored. For a few brief moments the light  illumined the divine visions that had been denied to him so long--light  clear and sweet and strong as though it streamed from the throne of  Heaven. Then suddenly it passed away: once more a great darkness covered  the face of Christ.    The arms of the boy drew close again the body of the dog. \"We shall see  His face--_there,_\" he murmured; \"and He will not part us, I think.\" On  the morrow, by the chancel of the cathedral, the people of Antwerp found  them both. They were both dead: the cold of the night had frozen into  stillness alike the young life and the old. When the Christmas morning  broke and the priests came to the temple, they saw them lying thus on  the stones together. Above the veils were drawn back from the great  visions of Rubens, and the fresh rays of the sunrise touched the  thorn-crowned head of the Christ.    As the day grew on there came an old, hard-featured man who wept as  women weep. \"I was cruel to the lad,\" he muttered, \"and now I would have  made amends--yea, to the half of my substance--and he should have been  to me as a son.\"    There came also, as the day grew apace, a painter who had fame in the  world, and who was liberal of hand and of spirit. \"I seek one who should  have had the prize yesterday had worth won,\" he said to the people--\"a  boy of rare promise and genius. An old wood-cutter on a fallen tree at  eventide--that was all his theme. But there was greatness for the future  in it. I would fain find him, and take him with me and teach him Art.\"    And a little child with curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly as she clung  to her father's arm, cried aloud, \"Oh, Nello, come! We have all ready  for thee. The Christ-child's hands are full of gifts, and the old piper  will play for us; and the mother says thou shalt stay by the hearth and  burn nuts with us all the Noel week long--yes, even to the Feast of the  Kings! And Patrasche will be so happy! Oh, Nello, wake and come!\"    But the young pale face, turned upward to the light of the great Rubens  with a smile upon its mouth, answered them all, \"It is too late.\"    For the sweet, sonorous bells went ringing through the frost, and the  sunlight shone upon the plains of snow, and the populace trooped gay and  glad through the streets, but Nello and Patrasche no more asked charity  at their hands. All they needed now Antwerp gave unbidden.    Death had been more pitiful to them than longer life would have been. It  had taken the one in the loyalty of love, and the other in the innocence  of faith, from a world which for love has no recompense and for faith no  fulfilment.    All their lives they had been together, and in their deaths they were  not divided: for when they were found the arms of the boy were folded  too closely around the dog to be severed without violence, and the  people of their little village, contrite and ashamed, implored a special  grace for them, and, making them one grave, laid them to rest there side  by side--forever!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7777"],[0,"Narrative of the Voyages Round the World, Performed (#8)"],[1,"that themselves  were generally the subject of the song, which was unpremeditated.  These minstrels were continually going about from place to place; and  they were rewarded, by the master of the house and the audience, with  such things as they wanted.    The repeated thefts which were committed by the inhabitants of  Otaheite brought our voyagers into frequent difficulties, and it  required all the wisdom of Lieutenant Cook to conduct himself in a  proper manner. His sentiments on the subject displayed the liberality  of his mind. He thought it of consequence to put an end, if possible  to thievish practices at once, by doing something that should engage  the natives in general to prevent them, from a regard to their common  interest. Strict orders had been given by him, that they should not  be fired upon, even when they were detected in attempting to steal any  of the English property. For this the lieutenant had many reasons. The  common sentinels were in no degree fit to be entrusted with a power of  life and death; neither did Mr. Cook think that the thefts committed  by the Otaheitans deserved so severe a punishment. They were not born  under the law of England; nor was it one of the conditions under which  they claimed the benefits of civil society, that their lives should be  forfeited, unless they abstained from theft. As the lieutenant was not  willing that the natives should be exposed to fire-arms loaded with  shot, neither did he approve of firing only with powder, which, if  repeatedly found to be harmless, would at length be despised. At a  time when a considerable robbery had been committed, an accident  furnished him with what he hoped would be a happy expedient for  preventing future attempts of the same kind. Above twenty of the  sailing canoes of the inhabitants came in with a supply of fish. Upon  these Lieutenant Cook immediately seized, and, having brought them  into the river behind the fort, gave notice, that unless the things  which had been stolen were returned, the canoes should be burnt. This  menace, without designing to put it into execution, he ventured to  publish, from a full conviction that, as restitution was thus made a  common cause, the stolen goods would all of them speedily be brought  back. In this, however, he was mistaken. An iron coal-rake, indeed,  was restored; upon which, great solicitation was made for the release  of the canoes; but he still insisted on his original condition. When  the next day came, he was much surprised to find that nothing further  had been returned; and, as the people were in the utmost distress for  the fish, which would in a short time be spoiled, he was reduced to  the disagreeable alternative, either of releasing the canoes contrary  to what he had solemnly and publicly declared, or of detaining them,  to the great damage of those who were innocent. As a temporary  expedient, he permitted the natives to take the fish, but still  detained the canoes. So far was this measure from being attended with  advantage, that it was productive of new confusion and injury; for as  it was not easy at once to distinguish to what particular persons the  several lots of fish belonged, the canoes were plundered by those who  had no right to any part of their cargo. At length, most pressing  instances being still made for the restoration of the canoes, and  Lieutenant Cook having reason to believe, either that the things for  which he detained them were not in the island, or that those who  suffered by their detention were absolutely incapable of prevailing  upon the thieves to relinquish their booty, he determined, though not  immediately, to comply with the solicitations of the natives. Our  commander was, however, not a little mortified at the ill success of  his project.    About the same time, another accident occurred, which, notwithstanding  all the caution of our principal voyagers, was very near embroiling  them with the Indians. The lieutenant having sent a boat on shore to  get ballast for the ship, the officer, not immediately finding stones  suitable to the purpose, began to pull down some part of an enclosure  in which the inhabitants had deposited the bones of their dead. This  action a number of the natives violently opposed; and a messenger came  down to the tents, to acquaint the gentlemen that no such thing would  be suffered. Mr. Banks directly repaired to the place, and soon put an  amicable end to the contest, by sending the boat's crew to the river,  where a sufficient quantity of stones might be gathered without a  possibility of giving offence. These Indians appeared to be much more  alarmed at any injury which they apprehended to be done to the dead  than to the living. This was the only measure in which they ventured  to oppose the English: and the only insult that was ever offered to  any individual belonging to the Endeavour was upon a similar occasion.  It should undoubtedly be the concern of all voyagers, to abstain from  wantonly offending the religious prejudices of the people among whom  they come.    To extend the knowledge of navigation and the sphere of discovery,  objects which we need not say that Lieutenant Cook kept always  steadily in view, he set out, in the pinnace, on the 26th of June,  accompanied by Mr. Banks, to make the circuit of the island; during  which the lieutenant and his companions were thrown into great alarm,  by the apprehended loss of the boat. By this expedition Mr. Cook  obtained an acquaintance with the several districts of Otaheite, the  chiefs who presided over them, and a variety of curious circumstances  respecting the manners and customs of the inhabitants. On the 1st of  July, he got back to the fort at Matavai, having found the circuit of  the island, including the two peninsulas of which it consisted, to be  about thirty leagues.    The circumnavigation of Otaheite was followed by an expedition of Mr.  Banks's to trace the river up the valley from which it issues, and  examine how far its banks were inhabited. During this excursion he  discerned many traces of subterraneous fire. The stones, like those of  Madeira, displayed evident tokens of having been burnt; and the very  clay upon the hills had the same appearance.    Another valuable employment of Mr. Banks was the planting of a great  quantity of the seeds of watermelons, oranges, lemons, limes, and  other plants and trees, which he had collected at Rio de Janeiro. For  these he prepared ground on each side of the fort, and selected as  many varieties of soil as could be found. He gave, also, liberally of  these seeds to the natives, and planted many of them in the woods.    Lieutenant Cook now began to prepare for his departure. On the 7th of  July, the carpenters were employed in taking down the gates and  palisadoes of the fortification; and it was continued to be dismantled  during the two following days. Our commander and the rest of the  gentlemen were in hopes that they should quit Otaheite without giving  or receiving any further offence; but in this respect they were  unfortunately disappointed. The lieutenant had prudently overlooked a  dispute of a smaller nature between a couple of foreign seamen and  some of the Indians, when he was immediately involved in a quarrel,  which lie greatly regretted, and which yet it was totally out of his  power to avoid. In the middle of the night, between the 8th and the  9th, Clement Webb and Samuel Gibson, two of the marines, went  privately from the fort. As they were not to be found in the morning,  Mr. Cook was apprehensive that they intended to stay behind; but,  being unwilling to endanger the harmony and goodwill which at present  subsisted between our people, and the natives, he determined to wait a  day for the chance of the men's return. As, to the great concern of  the lieutenant, the marines were not come back on the morning of the  tenth, inquiry was made after them of the Indians, who acknowledged  that each of them had taken a wife, and had resolved to become  inhabitants of the country. After some deliberation, two of the  natives undertook to conduct such persons to, the place of the  deserters' retreat, as Mr. Cook should think proper to send; and,  accordingly, he dispatched with the guides a petty officer and the  corporal of the marines. As it was of the utmost importance to recover  the men, and to do it speedily, it was intimated to several of the  chiefs who were in the fort with the women, among whom were Tubourai  Targaide, Tomio, and Oberea, that they would not be to leave it till  the fugitives were returned; and the lieutenant had the pleasure of  observing, that they received the intimation with very little  indications of alarm, and with assurances, that his people should be  secured and sent back as soon as possible. While this transaction took  place at the fort, our commander sent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to  fetch Tootahah on board the ship. Mr. Cook had reason to expect, if  the Indian guides proved faithful, that the deserters, and those who  went in search of them, would return before the evening. Being  disappointed, his suspicions increased, and thinking it not safe, when  the night approached, to let the persons whom he had detained as  hostages continue at the fort, he ordered Tubourai Tamaide, Oberea,  and some others, to be taken on board the Endeavour; a circumstance  which excited so general an alarm, that several of them, and  especially the women, expressed their apprehensions with great emotion  and many tears. Webb, about nine o'clock, was brought back by some of  the natives, who declared that Gibson, and the petty officer and  corporal, would not be restored till Tootahah should be set at  liberty. Lieutenant Cook now found that the tables were turned upon  him: but, having proceeded too far to retreat, he immediately  dispatched Mr. Hicks in the long-boat, with a strong party of men, to  rescue the prisoners. Tootahah was, "]]]
