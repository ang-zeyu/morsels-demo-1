THERE HAS BEEN AND WILL BE NO REINFORCEMENTS. FURTHER  RESISTANCE AND BLOODSHED ARE USELESS.    I ORDER ALL FIL-AMERICAN FORCES IN THE PHILIPPINES TO LAY DOWN ARMS  AND TO SURRENDER! WAINWRIGHT.\"    We were quite sure that Wainwright was being pressured by the Japanese  to make his broadcast. We questioned whether or not a captured general  still had the authority to issue orders to his former \"unsurrendered\"  command.    Transfer to Mountain Province: Trying to be a good soldier, I prepared  to make my transfer to Col. Horan's Guerrilla Unit. I obtained a good  guide and a strong horse. I told the officers and men of the 14th  Infantry, \"Good-bye and good luck.\" We started north.       After several days on the trail, the guide and I reached a small  barrio east of Ilagan. Natives told us Ilagan was occupied by  Japanese.    As I was bedding down in a small native shack, a Filipino quietly  crept up to my bed, and said, \"Sir! I am an emissary from General  Aguinaldo in Palanan. Sir! General Aguinaldo wants to hide you from  the Japanese for the duration of the war.\"    I was delighted; this seemed like the answer to a prayer. I had no  idea where Aguinaldo had ever heard of me, or why he was interested in  me. We did have one thing in common we were both doctors. I learned  several things about Aguinaldo: he had been mayor of a small barrio.  When the Americans took the Philippines from the Spanish in 1899,  Aguinaldo appointed himself the President of the Philippines and led  an insurgent army of 40,000 against the Americans and fought a long  and bloody war.    Aguinaldo was finally captured in Palanan by Gen. Fred Funston; he was  brought to Manila as a prisoner, where he swore an oath of allegiance  to the United States and became a good friend. The Military Governor,  Gen. Arthur MacArthur, the    father of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, treated Aguinaldo as an honored  guest in the Malacanong Palace in Manila.    General Aguinaldo's emissary told me to meet him the following day at  a Spanish hacienda, the Buen-venida, near the barrio of San Mariano,  about thirty miles to the south. He would lead me over the Sierra  Madre Mountains to Palanan and General Aguinaldo.    The next morning the guide and I started south-attempting to find the  designated hacienda. After riding all day, we finally arrived at a  hacienda, but not the Buen-venida. When I inquired as to the direction  to Buen-venida, the Spanish owner asked me:    \"Did you come to surrender?\" I answered with a very positive, \"No!\" He  said, \"Col. Warner and Major Minton are here with their staff-from  Palanan.\" I answered, \"I would like to see them!\"    As I greeted Col. Warner and Major Minton, in walked another American  from a different direction. Lt. Col. Theodore Kalakuka, QMC, Gen  Wainwright's G-4 from Manila, saying, \"I've been sent here by General  Wainwright.\" Ted had arrived in a Jap plane from Manila with a  Japanese pass. He continued, \"He has ordered all Fil-American troops  to surrender. If any unit does not surrender, all of the captives on  Corregidor will be severely punished (probably slaughtered!)\" For my  benefit, he continued, \"There are thousands of Americans in internment  camps that are extremely sick and desperately in need of medical care.  Any American who does not surrender will be considered a deserter of  the United States Army!\" (Several weeks later, Ted died of cerebral  malaria while looking for Americans who had not surrendered.)    Col. Warner pointed out to our officers that \"the Japanese have a  bounty on each of our heads. It is the beginning of the rainy season.  There is a great scarcity of food. The Japanese have warned the  Filipinos that anyone caught helping Americans would be executed. The  Filipinos can no longer afford to be friendly to Americans.\"                                  Chapter IV                  COL. WARNER SURRENDERS THE 14th INFANTRY                               (June 20, 1942)      Col. Warner officially surrendered the 14th Inf. to the Japanese on  June 20th. The following day our group walked down to the river and  obtained a guide and several bancas. We spent the day coasting down  the river to Ilagan. On the way down, I decided that no American would  be killed by my .45; I dropped it in the river.    In Ilagan, we hiked several blocks to a Japanese barracks, knocked on  the door and tried to explain to some ignorant soldiers that \"we had  come to surrender!\" We were about as welcome as a vacuum cleaner  salesman. With little planning we could have \"wiped them out.\" We were  finally directed to an empty house across the street to spend the  night, sleeping on the floor.    The next day we hired a Filipino caratella (pony cart) and rode about  fifty miles to Echague where we repeated the surrender process at a  cavalry barracks. Six of us Americans soon found ourselves sleeping on  the concrete floor of the guard house of the old Constabulary  Barracks, west of Echague. Our hosts were a squadron of Japanese  cavalry-probably the same squadron we used to watch going up and down  the highway.    Echague was the town where Guillermo Nakar and I had frequent  conferences with the Governor and provincial officials. We were only  fifteen miles from the radio shack, where Nakar was persisting in his  efforts to contact Gen. MacArthur.    I didn't get to Palanan to meet General Aguinaldo! I have often  wondered how different my life might have been-sitting out the war  with Aguinaldo.    Guests of a Japanese Cavalry Squadron: For one month, we six Americans  were assigned to perform all of the unpleasant chores of the squadron,  pumping water by hand, preparing vegetables, burying garbage, etc. We  were pleased when we heard through the \"bamboo telegraph\" (rumors  whispered to us by the natives selling us bananas and coconut cookies)  that the government officials that we had appointed had been accepted  by the Japanese. We knew that they would maintain a certain loyalty to  the United States.    The Japs called us \"captives,\" not P.O.W.s. Each morning and each  evening, we had to stand formation with the squadron-    facing east repeating an allegiance to the Emperor (we substituted our  own words, which we deemed more appropriate).    Nakar Successful: About the 4th of July, Col. Nakar succeeded in  contacting Australia. I quote from Gen. MacArthur's book,  Reminiscences: \"After the fall of Corregidor and the Southern Islands,  organized resistance to the Japanese in the Philippines had supposedly  come to an end. In reality, it never ended. Unfortunately for some  time, I could learn nothing of these activities. A deep pall of  silence settled over the whole archipelago.    \"Two months after the fall of Manila Bay Defenses, a brief and  pathetic message from a weak sending station on Luzon was brought to  me. Short as it was, it lifted the curtain of silence and uncertainty,  and disclosed the start of a human drama with few parallels in  military history. The words of that message warmed my heart: 'YOUR  RETURN IS THE NIGHTLY SUBJECT OF PRAYER IN EVERY FILIPINO HOME! -  NAKAR.'          \"I had acquired a force behind the Japanese lines that would  have far-reaching effect on the war in the days to come.    \"Unhappily, the sender of that first message, Lt. Col. Guillermo  Nakar, a former battalion commander of the 14th Infantry of the  Philippine Forces, was caught by the Japanese, tortured and beheaded.  The word passed from island to island, and from barrio to barrio. From  Aparri in the north to Zamboango in the south the fire of resistance  to the invader spread. Whole divisions of Japanese troops that the  Emperor badly needed elsewhere, deployed against phantom units.\"    Before Nakar's untimely capture, he had received the following  message: \"THE COURAGEOUS AND SPLENDID RESISTANCE MAINTAINED BY YOU AND  YOUR COMMAND FILLS ME WITH PRIDE AND SATISFACTION - Stop. IT WILL BE  MY PRIVILEGE TO SEE THAT YOU AND YOUR OFFICERS AND MEN ARE PROPERLY  REWARDED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME - Stop. MY AFFECTIONS AND BEST  WISHES. MACARTHUR.\"    Within a few weeks we learned that an unfaithful Filipino had betrayed  Col. Nakar. The Nipponese had captured him and the regimental radio in  a mountain cave near Jones, and had taken him to the old Spanish Fort  Santiago in Manila where they threw him in a dungeon to face  starvation, thirst, water rats, the ingenious system of Japanese  questioning and torture by the Kempie Tai Qapanese Secret Police), and  finally beheading.    Col. Nakar's short war was far from fruitless. His tender years did  not prevent him from becoming a \"champion of liberty!\" His message to  MacArthur actually signaled the end of Allied defeats and withdrawals,  and the beginning of an unbroken series of crushing defeats for the  Japanese Empire. It kept \"Freedom's Flame\" burning brightly throughout  the Philippines and gave the Filipinos the necessary strength and  courage to resist-and finally to defeat the invaders. Col. Nakar's  \"Brief and pathetic message from the Cagayan Valley\" gave MacArthur  the reassurance he needed:      To plan his aggressive warfare;    To fulfill his pledge to the Filipino people: \"I shall return!\"    and    To know he had a friendly base from which to attack Japan.      MacArthur's First Guerrilla Regiment (later the 14th Inf.) had  produced a much needed diversion for the hard-pressed forces on Bataan  and Corregidor. Thirty months later, these same guerrillas of the 14th  Inf. played an important part under the brilliant leadership of Col.  Russell Volckmann in assisting MacArthur's invasion of Luzon at  Lingayen Gulf on January 9th, 1945.    MacArthur stated, \"The guerrillas had been busy ever since receiving  my orders 'to open up!' They cut telephone wires and otherwise  disrupted Japanese communications. They blew up bridges and mined "]]]
