Cerdic was even obliged to  call for the assistance of his countrymen from the kingdoms of Kent  and Sussex, as well as from Germany, and he was thence joined by a  fresh army under the command of Porte, and of his sons Bleda, and  Megla [u].  Strengthened by these succours, he fought in the year 508,  a desperate battle with the Britons, commanded by Nazan-Leod, who was  victorious in the beginning of the action, and routed the wing in  which Cerdic himself commanded; but Kenric, who had prevailed in the  other wing, brought timely assistance to his father, and restored the  battle, which ended in a complete victory gained by the Saxons [w].  Nazan-Leod perished with 5000 of his army; but left the Britons more  weakened than discouraged by his death.  The war still continued,  though the success was commonly on the side of the Saxons, whose short  swords, and close manner of fighting, gave them great advantage over  the missile weapons of the Britons.  Cerdic was not wanting to his  good fortune; and in order to extend his conquests, he laid siege to  Mount Badon or Banesdowne, near Bath, whither the most obstinate of  the discomfited Britons had retired.  The southern Britons, in this  extremity, applied for assistance to Arthur, Prince of the Silures,  whose heroic valour now sustained the declining fate of his country  [x].  This is that Arthur so much celebrated in the songs of  Thaliessin, and the other British bards, and whose military  achievements have been blended with so many fables, as even to give  occasion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence. But poets,  though they disfigure the most certain history by their fictions, and  use strange liberties with truth where they are the sole historians,  as among the Britons, have commonly some foundation for their wildest  exaggerations.  Certain it is, that the siege of Badon was raised by  the Britons in the year 520; and the Saxons were there discomfited in  a great battle [y].  This misfortune stopped the progress of Cerdic;  but was not sufficient to wrest from him the conquests which he had  already made.  He and his son Kenric, who succeeded him, established  the kingdom of the West Saxons, or of Wessex, over the counties of  Hants, Dorset, Wilts, Berks, and the Isle of Wight, and left their  new-acquired dominions to their posterity.  Cerdic died in 534, Kenric  in 560.  [FN [t] Will. Malm. lib. 1. cap. 1. p.12.  Chron. Sax. p. 15.  [u]  Chron. Sax. p. 17.  [w] H. Hunting. lib. 2.  Ethelwerd, lib. 1. Chron.  Sax. p. 17.  [x] Hunting. lib. 2.  [y] Gildas, Saxon Chron.  H.  Hunting. lib. 2]    While the Saxons made this progress in the south, their countrymen  were not less active in other quarters.  In the year 527, a great  tribe of adventurers, under several leaders, landed on the east coast  of Britain; and after fighting many battles, of which history has  preserved no particular account, they established three new kingdoms  in this island.  Uffa assumed the title of King of the East Angles in  575; Crida that of Mercia in 585 [z] and Erkenwin that of East Saxony,  or Essex, nearly about the same time, but the year is uncertain.  This  latter kingdom was dismembered from that of Kent, and comprehended  Essex, Middlesex, and part of Hertfordshire.  That of the East Angles,  the counties of Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk; Mercia was extended  over all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn to the  frontiers of these two kingdoms.  [FN [z] Math. West. Huntington, lib. 2.]    The Saxons, soon after the landing of Hengist, had been planted in  Northumberland; but, as they met with an obstinate resistance, and  made but small progress in subduing the inhabitants, their affairs  were in so unsettled a condition, that none of their princes for a  long time assumed the appellation of king.  At last, in 547 [a], Ida,  a Saxon prince of great valour [b], who claimed a descent, as did the  other princes of that nation, from Woden, brought over a reinforcement  from Germany, and enabled the Northumbrians to carry on their  conquests over the Britons.  He entirely subdued the county now called  Northumberland, the bishopric of Durham, as well as some of the south-  east counties of Scotland; and he assumed the crown under the title of  King of Bernicia.  Nearly about the same time, Aella, another Saxon  prince, having conquered Lancashire, and the greater part of  Yorkshire, received the appellation of  King of Deiri [c].  These two  kingdoms were united in the person of Ethilfrid, grandson of Ida, who  married Acca, the daughter of Aella; and expelling her brother Edwin,  established one of the most powerful of the Saxon kingdoms, by the  title of Northumberland.  How far his dominions extended into the  country now called Scotland, is uncertain; but it cannot be doubted,  that all the lowlands, especially the east coast of that country, were  peopled in a great measure from Germany; though the expeditions made  by the several Saxon adventurers have escaped the records of history.  The language spoken in those countries, which is purely Saxon, is a  stronger proof of this event than can be opposed by the imperfect, or  rather fabulous, annals which are obtruded on us by the Scottish  historians.  [FN [a] Chron. Sax. p 19.  [b] Will. Malmes. p. 19.  [c] Ann. Beverl.  p. 78.]    [MN The Heptarcy.]  Thus was established, after a violent contest of near a hundred and  fifty years, the Heptarchy, or seven Saxon kingdoms in Britain; and  the whole southern part of the island, except Wales and Cornwall, had  totally changed its inhabitants, language, customs, and political  institutions.  The Britons, under the Roman dominion, had made such  advances towards arts and civil manners, that they had built twenty-  eight considerable cities within their province, besides a great  number of villages and country seats [d].  But the fierce conquerors,  by whom they were now subdued, threw every thing back into ancient  barbarity, and those few natives who were not either massacred or  expelled their habitations, were reduced to the most abject slavery.  None of the other northern conquerors, the Franks, Goths, Vandals, or  Burgundians, though they overran the southern provinces of the empire  like a mighty torrent, made such devastations in the conquered  territories, or were inflamed into so violent an animosity against the  ancient inhabitants.  As the Saxons came over at intervals in separate  bodies, the Britons, however at first unwarlike, were tempted to make  resistance; and hostilities being thereby prolonged, proved more  destructive to both parties, especially to the vanquished.  The first  invaders from Germany, instead of excluding other adventurers  who  must share with them the spoils of the ancient inhabitants, were  obliged to solicit fresh supplies from their own country; and a total  extermination of the Britons became the sole expedient for providing a  settlement and subsistence to the new planters.  Hence there have been  found in history few conquests more ruinous than that of the Saxons;  and few revolutions more violent than that which they introduced.  [FN  [d] Gildas. Bede. lib. 1.]    So long as the contest was maintained with the natives, the several  Saxon princes preserved a union of counsels and interests; but after  the Britons were shut up in the barren counties of Cornwall and Wales,  and gave no farther disturbance to the conquerors, the band of  alliance was in a great measure dissolved among the princes of the  Heptarchy.  Though one prince seems still to have been allowed, or to  have assumed, an ascendant over the whole, his authority, if it ought  ever to be deemed regular or legal, was extremely limited; and each  state acted as if it had been independent, and wholly separate from  the rest.  Wars therefore, and revolutions and dissensions, were  unavoidable among a turbulent and military people; and these events,  however intricate or confused, ought now to become the objects of our  attention.  But, added to the difficulty of carrying on at once the  history of seven independent kingdoms, there is great discouragement  to a writer, arising from the uncertainty, at least barrenness, of the  accounts transmitted to us.  The monks, who were the only annalists  during those ages, lived remote from public affairs, considered the  civil transactions as entirely subordinate to the ecclesiastical, and,  besides partaking of the ignorance and barbarity which were then  universal, were strongly infected with credulity, with the love of  wonder, and with a propensity to imposture; vices almost inseparable  from their profession and manner of life.  The history of that period  abounds in names, but is extremely barren of events; or the events are  related so much without circumstances and causes, that the most  profound or most eloquent writer must despair of rendering them either  instructive or entertaining to the reader.  Even the great learning  and vigorous imagination of Milton sunk under the weight; and this  author scruples not to declare, that the skirmishes of kites or crows  as much merited a particular narrative, as the confused transactions  and battles of the Saxon Heptarchy [e].  In order, however, to connect  the events in some tolerable measure, we shall give a succinct account  of the succession of kings, and of the more remarkable revolutions in  each particular kingdom; beginning with that of Kent, which was the  first established.  [FN [e] Milton in Kennet, p. 50.]    [MN The Kingdom of Kent.]  Escus succeeded his father Hengist in the kingdom of Kent; but seems  not to have possessed the military genius of that conqueror, who first  made way for the entrance of the Saxon arms into Britain.  All the  Saxons who sought either the fame of valour, or new establishments by  arms, flocked to the standard of Aella, King of Sussex, who was  carrying on successful war against the Britons,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10580"],[0,"The Positive School of Criminology (#9)"],[1,"could designate the Middle Ages by the term  \"dirty.\" because they neglected the demands of elementary hygiene, and  thus of human morality. For where the requirements of our physical body  are neglected or offended, there no flower can bloom. The telluric  environment has a great influence on our physical activity, by way of  our nervous system. We feel differently disposed, according to whether a  south or a north wind blows. When Garibaldi was on the Pampas, he  observed that his companions were irascible and prone to violent  quarrels, when the Pampero blew, and that their behavior changed, when  this wind ceased. The great founders of criminal statistics, Quetelet  and Guerry, observed that the change of seasons carried with it a change  in criminality. Sexual crimes are less frequent in winter than in spring  and summer. And with reference to this point I have maintained, and  still maintain, that it is due to the combined effects of temperature  and social conditions, if crimes against property increase in winter.  For lack of employment, the want of food and shelter, intensify the  misery and lead to attacks on property. On the other hand, the cold by  itself reduces sexual crimes and personal assaults. And those who claim  that the longer intercourse between people in summer time has also a  social influence, are also partly in the right.    The most eloquent fact in this respect was mentioned by Murro, when he  pointed out that this change in the frequency of bloody crimes, greater  in the warm months than in winter, applied also to prisoners. Statistics  show that breach of discipline is most frequent in hot seasons. The  social factor does not enter there, because the social life is there the  same in winter and in summer. This is, therefore, a practical proof of  the influence of climate, and it is re-enforced by the fact that  delirium and epilepsy in insane asylums are also more frequent in hot  than in cold months. The influence of the telluric factors, then, cannot  be denied, and the influence of the social factor intensifies it, as I  have already shown by its most drastic and characteristic example, that  of want. One can, therefore, understand that a man, whose morality has  been shaken by the pressure of increasing want, may be led to commit a  crime against property or persons.    It is certainly quite evident, that economic misery has an undeniable  influence on criminality. And if you consider, that about 300,000  criminals are sentenced in Italy every year, 180,000 of them for minor  crimes, and 120,000 for crimes which belong to the gravest class, you  can easily see that the greater part of them due mainly to social  conditions, for which it should not be so very difficult to find a  remedy. The work of the legislator may be slow, difficult, and  inadequate, so far as the telluric and anthropological factors are  concerned. But it could surely be rapid, efficacious and prompt, so far  as the social factors influencing criminality are concerned.    We have now demonstrated that crime has its natural source in the  combined interaction of three classes of causes, the anthropological  (organic and psychological) factor, the telluric factor, and the social  factor. And by this last factor we must not only mean want, but any  other condition of administrative instability in political, moral, and  intellectual life. Every social condition which makes the life of man in  society insincere and imperfect is a social factor contributing towards  criminality. The economic factor is in evidence in our civilization  wherever the law of free competition, which is but a form of disguised  cannibalism, establishes the rule: _Your death is my life_. The  competition of laborers for a limited number of places is equivalent to  saying that those who secure a living do so at the expense of those who  do not. And this is a disguised form of cannibalism. While it does not  devour the competitor as primitive mankind did, it paralyzes him by  calumnies, recommendations, protection, money, which, secure the place  for the best bargainer and leave the most honest, talented, and  self-respecting to the pangs of starvation.    Moreover, the economic factor exerts its crime-breeding influence also  under the form of a superabundance of wealth. Indeed, in our present  society, which is in the downward stage of transition from glorious  bourgeois civilization, which constituted a golden page of human  history in the 19th century, wealth itself is a source of crime. For the  rich, who do not enjoy the advantage of manual or intellectual work,  suffer from the corruption of leisure and vice. Gambling throws them  into an unhealthy fever; the struggle and race for money poison their  daily lives. And although the rich may keep out of reach of the penal  code, still they have condemned themselves to a life devoted to  hypocritical ceremonies, which are devoid of moral sentiment. And this  life leads them to a sportive form of criminality. To cheat at gambling  is the inevitable fate of these parasites. In order to kill time they  give themselves up to games of chance, and those who do not care for  that devote themselves to the sport of adultery, which in that class is  a pastime even among the best friends, on account of sheer mental  poverty. And all because man's mind unoccupied is the devil's own forge,  as the English poet says.    We have now surveyed briefly the natural genesis of crime, as a natural  social phenomenon, brought about by the interaction of anthropological,  telluric, and social influences, which in any determined moment act  upon a personality standing on the cross road of vice and virtue, crime  and honesty. This scientific deduction gives rise to a series of  investigations which satisfy the mind and supply it with a real  understanding of things, far better than the theory that a man is a  criminal because he wants to be. No, a man commits crime because he  finds himself in certain physical and social conditions, from which the  evil plant of crime takes life and strength. Thus we obtain the origin  of that sad human figure which is the product of the interaction of  those factors, an abnormal man, a man not adapted to the conditions of  the social environment in which he is born, so that emigration becomes  an ever more permanent phenomenon for the greater portion of men, for  whom the accident of birth will less and less determine the course of  their future life. And the abnormal man who is below the minimum of  adaptability to social life and bears the marks of organic degeneration,  develops either a passive or an aggressive form of abnormality and  becomes a criminal.    Among these abnormal human beings, two groups must be particularly  distinguished. Limiting our observations to those who are true  aggressively antisocial abnormals, that is to say, who are not adapted  to a certain social order and attack it by crimes, we must distinguish  those who for egoistic or ferocious reasons attack society by atavistic  forms of the struggle for existence by committing socalled common crimes  in the shape of fraud or violence, thereby opposing or abolishing  conditions in which their fellow beings may live. This is the atavistic  type of criminals which represents an involutionary, or retrogressive,  form of abnormality, due to an arrested development or an atavistic  reversion to a savage and primitive type. These constitute the majority  in the world of criminals and must be distinguished from the minority,  who are evolutionary, or progressive, abnormals, that may also commit  crime in a violent form, but must not be confounded with the others,  because they do not act from egoistic motives, but rebel from altruistic  motives against the injustice of the present order. These altruistic  criminals feel the sufferings and horrors due to the injustice  surrounding them and may go so far as to commit murder, which must  always be condemned, but which must not be confounded with atavistic or  egoistic murder. Recourse to personal violence is always objectionable  from the point of view of higher manhood, which desires that human life  should always be held in respect. But the reasons for such a crime are  different, being egoistic in the one, and altruistic in the other case.  The evolutionary abnormal is often an instrument of human progress, not  in the form of criminality, but in that of intellectual and moral  rebellion against conditions which are sanctioned by laws that  frequently punish such an evolutionary rebellion harder than atavistic  crime, as they do in Russia, where capital punishment has been abolished  for common crimes, but retained for political violations of the law! We  are living in an epoch of transition from the old to the new, and  contemporaneous humanity has an uneasy moral conscience in this critical  time. The ruling classes are losing their clearness of vision, so that  they promise monuments to those political murderers who promoted their  own historical victories, but would condemn like any common criminal him  who now devotes his soul to a revolutionary ideal, would throw into  prison the pioneer of new human ideals, just as Russia is  excommunicating the rebel Tolstoi. I mention Leo Tolstoi advisedly for  the purpose of giving a precise illustration of my heterodox thought in  reference to this question. We are opposed to any form of personal  violence (with the sole exception of self-defense), we cannot approve of  any form of personal assault, no matter what may be its motive.  Therefore we cannot have words of praise or excuse for political murder,  though it may be inspired by altruistic motives. We can demand that the  legislator should distinguish between the psychological sources of these  two forms of murder, the egoistic and the altruistic form. But we  condemn them both, because they are inhuman forms of violence. Ideas do  not make"]]]
