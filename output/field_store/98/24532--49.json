It rests on the observation of identity and diversity; for, to  judge, is to unite to an object the notion which belongs to it. The  sciences, even the best,--mathematics, and astronomy, are like  sportsmen, who seize whatever prey offers, even without being able to  make any use of them. Dialectic must teach the use of them. \"This is  of that rank that no intellectual man will enter on any study for its  own sake, but only with a view to advance himself in that one sole  science which embraces all.\"    \"The essence or peculiarity of man is to comprehend the whole; or that  which in the diversity of sensations, can be comprised under a rational  unity.\" \"The soul which has never perceived the truth, cannot pass  into the human form.\" I announce to men the intellect. I announce the  good of being interpenetrated by the mind that made nature: this  benefit, namely, that it can understand nature, which it made and  maketh. Nature is good, but intellect is better: as the law-giver is  before the law-receiver. I give you joy, O sons of men: that truth is  altogether wholesome; that we have hope to search out what might be  the very self of everything. The misery of man is to be balked of the  sight of essence, and to be stuffed with conjecture: but the supreme  good is reality; the supreme beauty is reality; and all virtue and all  felicity depend on this science of the real: for courage is nothing  else than knowledge: the fairest fortune that can befall man, is to  be guided by his daemon to that which is truly his own. This also is  the essence of justice,--to attend every one his own; nay, the notion  of virtue is not to be arrived at, except through direct contemplation  of the divine essence. Courage, then, for \"the persuasion that we must  search that which we do not know, will render us, beyond comparison,  better, braver, and more industrious, than if we thought it impossible  to discover what we do not know, and useless to search for it.\" He  secures a position not to be commanded, by his passion for reality;  valuing philosophy only as it is the pleasure of conversing with real  being.    Thus, full of the genius of Europe, he said, \"Culture.\" He saw the  institutions of Sparta, and recognized more genially, one would say,  than any since, the hope of education. He delighted in every  accomplishment, in every graceful and useful and truthful performance;  above all, in the splendors of genius and intellectual achievement.  \"The whole of life, O Socrates,\" said Glauco, \"is, with the wise the  measure of hearing such discourses as these.\" What a price he sets on  the feats of talent, on the powers of Pericles, of Isocrates, of  Parmenides! What price, above price on the talents themselves! He  called the several faculties, gods, in his beautiful personation. What  value he gives to the art of gymnastics in education; what to geometry;  what to music, what to astronomy, whose appeasing and medicinal power  he celebrates! In the Timseus, he indicates the highest employment of  the eyes. \"By us it is asserted, that God invented and bestowed sight  on us for this purpose,--that, on surveying the circles of intelligence  in the heavens, we might properly employ those of our own minds, which,  though disturbed when compared with the others that are uniform, are  still allied to their circulations; and that, having thus learned, and  being naturally possessed of a correct reasoning faculty, we might,  by imitating the uniform revolutions of divinity, set right our own  wanderings and blunders.\" And in the Republic,--\"By each of these  disciplines, a certain organ of the soul is both purified and  reanimated, which is blinded and buried by studies of another kind;  an organ better worth saving than ten thousand eyes, since truth is  perceived by this alone.\"    He said, Culture; but he first admitted its basis, and gave immeasurably  the first place to advantages of nature. His patrician tastes laid  stress on the distinctions of birth. In the doctrine of the organic  character and disposition is the origin of caste. \"Such as were fit  to govern, into their composition the informing Deity mingled gold:  into the military, silver; iron and brass for husbandmen and  artificers.\" The East confirms itself, in all ages, in this faith. The  Koran is explicit on this point of caste. \"Men have their metal, as  of gold and silver. Those of you who were the worthy ones in the state  of ignorance, will be the worthy ones in the state of faith, as soon  as you embrace it.\" Plato was not less firm. \"Of the five orders of  things, only four can be taught in the generality of men.\" In the  Republic, he insists on the temperaments of the youth, as the first  of the first.    A happier example of the stress laid on nature, is in the dialogue  with the young Theages, who wishes to receive lessons from Socrates.  Socrates declares that, if some have grown wise by associating with  him, no thanks are due to him; but, simply, whilst they were with him,  they grew wise, not because of him; he pretends not to know the way  of it. \"It is adverse to many, nor can those be benefited by associating  with me, whom the Daemons oppose, so that it is not possible for me  to live with these. With many, however, he does not prevent me from  conversing, who yet are not at all benefited by associating with me.  Such, O Theages, is the association with me; for, if it pleases the  God, you will make great and rapid proficiency: you will not, if he  does not please. Judge whether it is not safer to be instructed by  some one of those who have power over the benefit which they impart  to men, than by me, who benefit or not, just as it may happen.\" As if  he had said, \"I have no system. I cannot be answerable for you. You  will be what you must. If there is love between us, inconceivably  delicious and profitable will our intercourse be; if not, your time  is lost, and you will only annoy me. I shall seem to you stupid, and  the reputation I have, false. Quite above us, beyond the will of you  or me, is this secret affinity or repulsion laid. All my good is  magnetic, and I educate, not by lessons, but by going about my  business.\"    He said, Culture; he said, Nature; and he failed not to add, \"There  is also the divine.\" There is no thought in any mind, but it quickly  tends to convert itself into a power, and organizes a huge  instrumentality of means. Plato, lover of limits, loved the illimitable,  saw the enlargement and nobility which come from truth itself, and  good itself, and attempted, as if on the part of the human intellect,  once for all, to do it adequate homage,--homage fit for the immense  soul to receive, and yet homage becoming the intellect to render. He  said, then, \"Our faculties run out into infinity, and return to us  thence. We can define but a little way; but here is a fact which will  not be skipped, and which to shut our eyes upon is suicide. All things  are in a scale; and, begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things  are symbolical; and what we call results are beginnings.\"    A key to the method and completeness of Plato is his twice bisected  line. After he has illustrated the relation between the absolute good  and true, and the forms of the intelligible world, he says:--\"Let there  be a line cut in two, unequal parts. Cut again each of these two  parts,--one representing the visible, the other the intelligible  world,--and these two new sections, representing the bright part and  the dark part of these worlds, you will have, for one of the sections  of the visible world,--images, that is, both shadows and reflections;  for the other section, the objects of these images,-that is, plants,  animals, and the works of art and nature. Then divide the intelligible  world in like manner; the one section will be of opinions and  hypotheses, and the other section, of truths.\" To these four sections,  the four operations of the soul correspond,--conjecture, faith,  understanding, reason. As every pool reflects the image of the sun,  so every thought and thing restores us an image and creature of the  supreme Good. The universe is perforated by a million channels for his  activity. All things mount and mount.    All his thought has this ascension; in Phaedrus, teaching that \"beauty  is the most lovely of all things, exciting hilarity, and shedding  desire and confidence through the universe, wherever it enters; and  it enters, in some degree, into all things; but that there is another,  which is as much more beautiful than beauty, as beauty is than chaos;  namely, wisdom, which our wonderful organ of sight cannot reach unto,  but which, could it be seen, would ravish us with its perfect reality.\"  He has the same regard to it as the source of excellence in works of  art. \"When an artificer, in the fabrication of any work, looks to that  which always subsists according to the same; and, employing a model  of this kind, expresses its idea and power in his work; it must follow,  that his production should be beautiful. But when he beholds that which  is born and dies, it will be far from beautiful.\"    Thus ever: the Banquet is a teaching in the same spirit, familiar now  to all the poetry, and to all the sermons of the world, that the love  of the sexes is initial; and symbolizes, at a distance, the passion  of the soul for that immense lake of beauty it exists to seek. This  faith in the Divinity is never out of mind, and constitutes the  limitation of all his dogmas. Body cannot teach wisdom;--God only. In  the same mind, he constantly affirms that virtue cannot be taught;  that it is not a science, but an inspiration; that the greatest goods  are produced to us through mania, and are assigned to us by a divine  gift.    This leads me to that central figure, which he has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6317"],[0,"Sailing Alone Around the World (#8)"],[1,"t! come in  what you have on; that is what we mean.\" \"Aye, aye, sir!\" The  _Collingwood's_ cheer was good, and had I worn a silk hat as high as  the moon I could not have had a better time or been made more at home.  An Englishman, even on his great battle-ship, unbends when the  stranger passes his gangway, and when he says \"at home\" he means it.    That one should like Gibraltar would go without saying. How could one  help loving so hospitable a place? Vegetables twice a week and milk  every morning came from the palatial grounds of the admiralty.  \"_Spray_ ahoy!\" would hail the admiral. \"_Spray_ ahoy!\" \"Hello!\"  \"To-morrow is your vegetable day, sir.\" \"Aye, aye, sir!\"    I rambled much about the old city, and a gunner piloted me through the  galleries of the rock as far as a stranger is permitted to go. There  is no excavation in the world, for military purposes, at all  approaching these of Gibraltar in conception or execution. Viewing the  stupendous works, it became hard to realize that one was within the  Gibraltar of his little old Morse geography.    Before sailing I was invited on a picnic with the governor, the  officers of the garrison, and the commanders of the war-ships at the  station; and a royal affair it was. Torpedo-boat No. 91, going  twenty-two knots, carried our party to the Morocco shore and back. The  day was perfect--too fine, in fact, for comfort on shore, and so no  one landed at Morocco. No. 91 trembled like an aspen-leaf as she raced  through the sea at top speed. Sublieutenant Boucher, apparently a mere  lad, was in command, and handled his ship with the skill of an older  sailor. On the following day I lunched with General Carrington, the  governor, at Line Wall House, which was once the Franciscan convent.  In this interesting edifice are preserved relics of the fourteen  sieges which Gibraltar has seen. On the next day I supped with the  admiral at his residence, the palace, which was once the convent of  the Mercenaries. At each place, and all about, I felt the friendly  grasp of a manly hand, that lent me vital strength to pass the coming  long days at sea. I must confess that the perfect discipline, order,  and cheerfulness at Gibraltar were only a second wonder in the great  stronghold. The vast amount of business going forward caused no more  excitement than the quiet sailing of a well-appointed ship in a smooth  sea. No one spoke above his natural voice, save a boatswain's mate now  and then. The Hon. Horatio J. Sprague, the venerable United States  consul at Gibraltar, honored the _Spray_ with a visit on Sunday,  August 24, and was much pleased to find that our British cousins had  been so kind to her.          CHAPTER V      Sailing from Gibraltar with the assistance of her Majesty's tug--The  _Spray's_ course changed from the Suez Canal to Cape Horn--Chased by a  Moorish pirate--A comparison with Columbus--The Canary Islands-The  Cape Verde Islands--Sea life--Arrival at Pernambuco--A bill against  the Brazilian government--Preparing for the stormy weather of the  cape.    Monday, August 25, the _Spray_ sailed from Gibraltar, well repaid for  whatever deviation she had made from a direct course to reach the  place. A tug belonging to her Majesty towed the sloop into the steady  breeze clear of the mount, where her sails caught a volant wind, which  carried her once more to the Atlantic, where it rose rapidly to a  furious gale. My plan was, in going down this coast, to haul offshore,  well clear of the land, which hereabouts is the home of pirates; but I  had hardly accomplished this when I perceived a felucca making out of  the nearest port, and finally following in the wake of the _Spray_.  Now, my course to Gibraltar had been taken with a view to proceed up  the Mediterranean Sea, through the Suez Canal, down the Red Sea, and  east about, instead of a western route, which I finally adopted. By  officers of vast experience in navigating these seas, I was influenced  to make the change. Longshore pirates on both coasts being numerous, I  could not afford to make light of the advice. But here I was, after  all, evidently in the midst of pirates and thieves! I changed my  course; the felucca did the same, both vessels sailing very fast, but  the distance growing less and less between us. The _Spray_ was doing  nobly; she was even more than at her best; but, in spite of all I  could do, she would broach now and then. She was carrying too much  sail for safety. I must reef or be dismasted and lose all, pirate or  no pirate. I must reef, even if I had to grapple with him for my life.    I was not long in reefing the mainsail and sweating it up--probably  not more than fifteen minutes; but the felucca had in the meantime so  shortened the distance between us that I now saw the tuft of hair on  the heads of the crew,--by which, it is said, Mohammed will pull the  villains up into heaven,--and they were coming on like the wind. From  what I could clearly make out now, I felt them to be the sons of  generations of pirates, and I saw by their movements that they were  now preparing to strike a blow. The exultation on their faces,  however, was changed in an instant to a look of fear and rage. Their  craft, with too much sail on, broached to on the crest of a great  wave. This one great sea changed the aspect of affairs suddenly as the  flash of a gun. Three minutes later the same wave overtook the _Spray_  and shook her in every timber. At the same moment the sheet-strop  parted, and away went the main-boom, broken short at the rigging.  Impulsively I sprang to the jib-halyards and down-haul, and instantly  downed the jib. The head-sail being off, and the helm put hard down,  the sloop came in the wind with a bound. While shivering there, but a  moment though it was, I got the mainsail down and secured inboard,  broken boom and all. How I got the boom in before the sail was torn I  hardly know; but not a stitch of it was broken. The mainsail being  secured, I hoisted away the jib, and, without looking round, stepped  quickly to the cabin and snatched down my loaded rifle and cartridges  at hand; for I made mental calculations that the pirate would by this  time have recovered his course and be close aboard, and that when I  saw him it would be better for me to be looking at him along the  barrel of a gun. The piece was at my shoulder when I peered into the  mist, but there was no pirate within a mile. The wave and squall that  carried away my boom dismasted the felucca outright. I perceived his  thieving crew, some dozen or more of them, struggling to recover their  rigging from the sea. Allah blacken their faces!    I sailed comfortably on under the jib and forestaysail, which I now  set. I fished the boom and furled the sail snug for the night; then  hauled the sloop's head two points offshore to allow for the set of  current and heavy rollers toward the land. This gave me the wind three  points on the starboard quarter and a steady pull in the headsails. By  the time I had things in this order it was dark, and a flying-fish had  already fallen on deck. I took him below for my supper, but found  myself too tired to cook, or even to eat a thing already prepared. I  do not remember to have been more tired before or since in all my life  than I was at the finish of that day. Too fatigued to sleep, I rolled  about with the motion of the vessel till near midnight, when I made  shift to dress my fish and prepare a dish of tea. I fully realized  now, if I had not before, that the voyage ahead would call for  exertions ardent and lasting. On August 27 nothing could be seen of  the Moor, or his country either, except two peaks, away in the east  through the clear atmosphere of morning. Soon after the sun rose even  these were obscured by haze, much to my satisfaction.    [Illustration: Chased by pirates.]    The wind, for a few days following my escape from the pirates, blew a  steady but moderate gale, and the sea, though agitated into long  rollers, was not uncomfortably rough or dangerous, and while sitting  in my cabin I could hardly realize that any sea was running at all, so  easy was the long, swinging motion of the sloop over the waves. All  distracting uneasiness and excitement being now over, I was once more  alone with myself in the realization that I was on the mighty sea and  in the hands of the elements. But I was happy, and was becoming more  and more interested in the voyage.    Columbus, in the _Santa Maria_, sailing these seas more than four  hundred years before, was not so happy as I, nor so sure of success in  what he had undertaken. His first troubles at sea had already begun.  His crew had managed, by foul play or otherwise, to break the ship's  rudder while running before probably just such a gale as the _Spray_  had passed through; and there was dissension on the _Santa Maria_,  something that was unknown on the _Spray_.    After three days of squalls and shifting winds I threw myself down to  rest and sleep, while, with helm lashed, the sloop sailed steadily on  her course.    September 1, in the early morning, land-clouds rising ahead told of  the Canary Islands not far away. A change in the weather came next  day: storm-clouds stretched their arms across the sky; from the east,  to all appearances, might come a fierce harmattan, or from the south  might come the fierce hurricane. Every point of the compass threatened  a wild storm. My attention was turned to reefing sails, and no time  was to be lost over it, either, for the sea in a moment was confusion  itself, and I was glad to head the sloop three points or more away  from her true course that she might ride safely over the waves. I was  now scudding her for the channel between Africa and the island of  Fuerteventura, the easternmost of the Canary Islands, for which I was  on the lookout. At 2 P.M., the weather becoming suddenly fine, the  island stood in view, already abeam to starboard, and not more"]]]
