As for myself--I was as happy  as a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her  on my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged  me! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,  rounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with  her hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in  the dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate  my eyes with them.\"    Wanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to  smile.    \"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those  days you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I  received from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court  to a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became  the admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of  irreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.  You see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned  the strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that  sort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a  woman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia  Borgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"    Wanda rose and opened the window.    \"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating  all one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an  aureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a  daring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will  corrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,  opened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as  she had appeared to me the first time.    \"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about  in bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"    \"In a moment.\"    As I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had  kindled a small fire.    \"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold  already. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs  until the room is sufficiently warm.\"    \"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,  and kissed her.    \"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"    \"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.  Furthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized  natures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a  physical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly  escape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between  electricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human  organism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate  characters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with  electricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises  such a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This  is why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these  adorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite  animal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,  Wieland.\"    \"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a  large cat, an augmented electric battery?\"    \"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic  meaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.  Monarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in  this sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it  only for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael  could find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the  roseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"    \"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you  haven't told me everything. You associate something entirely  individual with furs.\"    \"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has  a peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more  than tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a  beautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal  derived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body  of a Phryne, except in furs.\"    \"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing  quality to a woman.\"    \"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me  everything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives  its nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly  sensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs  fell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which  really was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the  gridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild  animals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment  with a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on  seemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a  beautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and  everything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally  carried the idea into a sort of cult.    \"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only  sacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because  the most important function of existence--the continuation of the  species--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of  nature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him  she was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served  her purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her  cruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.    \"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the  bridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress  had sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I  envied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily  ensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,  where, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him  broken on the wheel--\"    \"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the  hands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the  teeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for  your kind of poetry.\"    \"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"    \"Have you actually lost your senses.\"    \"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for  reading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I  loved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented  them. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the  inquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;  all the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,  beautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of  Hungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian  Czarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes  bordered with ermine.\"    \"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and  simultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak  coquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played  beautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,  half broken on the wheel?\"    Her piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking  satisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and  threw my arms about her.    \"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept  long enough.\"    \"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.    I was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this  warm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell  upon me through her half-closed lids.    _\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom  I worship.\"_    \"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.    \"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while  she gives herself to another.\"    \"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of  you to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must  meet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.  Why not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"    I looked at Wanda frightened.    \"You surpass my dreams.\"    \"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find  your ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more  cruelly than you anticipate.\"    \"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,  burying my burning face in her lap.    \"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the  room laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when  I stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked  archly, when we met in the park to-day.    At first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were  battling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the  stone-benches, and played with a flower.    \"Well--am I?\"    I kneeled down and seized her hands.    \"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if  you can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,  without reservation, without softness.\"    \"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if  you prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,  \"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you  realized your imaginings."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#8)"],[1,"out of the ditch, shook himself,  looked round for his assailant, and, not finding him, hurried to the  guard-tent to see what was happening.          VII    A CLUE      The guard-tent had disappeared.    Private Jones' bewildered eye, rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to  earth, and from earth to heaven, in search of the missing edifice,  found it at last in a tangled heap upon the ground. It was too dark to  see anything distinctly, but he perceived that the canvas was rising  and falling spasmodically like a stage sea, and for a similar  reason--because there were human beings imprisoned beneath it.    By this time the whole camp was up and doing. Figures in  _deshabille_, dashing the last vestiges of sleep away with their  knuckles, trooped on to the scene in twos and threes, full of inquiry  and trenchant sarcasm.    \"What are you men playing at? What's all the row about? Can't you  finish that game of footer some other time, when we aren't trying to  get to sleep? What on earth's up?\"    Then the voice of one having authority.    \"What's the matter? What are you doing?\"    It was perfectly obvious what the guard was doing. It was trying to  get out from underneath the fallen tent. Private Jones explained this  with some warmth.    \"Somebody jumped at me and sat on my head in the ditch. I couldn't get  up. And then some blackguard cut the ropes of the guard-tent. I  couldn't see who it was. He cut off directly the tent went down.\"    Private Jones further expressed a wish that he could find the chap.  When he did, there would, he hinted, be trouble in the old homestead.    The tent was beginning to disgorge its prisoners.    \"Guard, turn out!\" said a facetious voice from the darkness.    The camp was divided into two schools of thought. Those who were  watching the guard struggle out thought the episode funny. The guard  did not. It was pathetic to hear them on the subject of their  mysterious assailants. Matters quieted down rapidly after the tent had  been set up again. The spectators were driven back to their lines by  their officers. The guard turned in again to try and restore their  shattered nerves with sleep until their time for sentry-go came round.  Private Jones picked up his rifle and resumed his beat. The affair was  at an end as far as that night was concerned.    Next morning, as might be expected, nothing else was talked about.  Conversation at breakfast was confined to the topic. No halfpenny  paper, however many times its circulation might exceed that of any  penny morning paper, ever propounded so fascinating and puzzling a  breakfast-table problem. It was the utter impossibility of detecting  the culprits that appealed to the schools. They had swooped down like  hawks out of the night, and disappeared like eels into mud, leaving no  traces.    Jimmy Silver, of course, had no doubts.    \"It was those Kay's men,\" he said. \"What does it matter about  evidence? You've only got to look at 'em. That's all the evidence you  want. The only thing that makes it at all puzzling is that they did  nothing worse. You'd naturally expect them to slay the sentry, at any  rate.\"    But the rest of the camp, lacking that intimate knowledge of the  Kayite which he possessed, did not turn the eye of suspicion towards  the Eckleton lines. The affair remained a mystery. Kennedy, who never  gave up a problem when everybody else did, continued to revolve the  mystery in his mind.    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" he said to Silver, two days later, \"if you were  right.\"    Silver, who had not made any remark for the last five minutes, with  the exception of abusive comments on the toughness of the meat which  he was trying to carve with a blunt knife for the tent, asked for an  explanation. \"I mean about that row the other night.\"    \"What row?\"    \"That guard-tent business.\"    \"Oh, that! I'd forgotten. Why don't you move with the times? You're  always thinking of something that's been dead and buried for years.\"    \"You remember you said you thought it was those Kay's chaps who did  it. I've been thinking it over, and I believe you're right. You see,  it was probably somebody who'd been to camp before, or he wouldn't  have known that dodge of loosing the ropes.\"    \"I don't see why. Seems to me it's the sort of idea that might have  occurred to anybody. You don't want to study the thing particularly  deeply to know that the best way of making a tent collapse is to loose  the ropes. Of course it was Kay's lot who did it. But I don't see how  you're going to have them simply because one or two of them have been  here before.\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" said Kennedy.    After tea the other occupants of the tent went out of the lines to  play stump-cricket. Silver was in the middle of a story in one of the  magazines, so did not accompany them. Kennedy cried off on the plea of  slackness.    \"I say,\" he said, when they were alone.    \"Hullo,\" said Silver, finishing his story, and putting down the  magazine. \"What do you say to going after those chaps? I thought that  story was going to be a long one that would take half an hour to get  through. But it collapsed. Like that guard-tent.\"    \"About that tent business,\" said Kennedy. \"Of course that was all rot  what I was saying just now. I suddenly remembered that I didn't  particularly want anybody but you to hear what I was going to say, so  I had to invent any rot that I could think of.\"    \"But now,\" said Jimmy Silver, sinking his voice to a melodramatic  whisper, \"the villagers have left us to continue their revels on the  green, our wicked uncle has gone to London, his sinister retainer,  Jasper Murgleshaw, is washing his hands in the scullery sink,  and--_we are alone!_\"    \"Don't be an ass,\" pleaded Kennedy.    \"Tell me your dreadful tale. Conceal nothing. Spare me not. In fact,  say on.\"    \"I've had a talk with the chap who was sentry that night,\" began  Kennedy.    \"Astounding revelations by our special correspondent,\" murmured  Silver.    \"You might listen.\"    \"I _am_ listening. Why don't you begin? All this hesitation  strikes me as suspicious. Get on with your shady story.\"    \"You remember the sentry was upset--\"    \"Very upset.\"    \"Somebody collared him from behind, and upset him into the ditch. They  went in together, and the other man sat on his head.\"    \"A touching picture. Proceed, friend.\"    \"They rolled about a bit, and this sentry chap swears he scratched the  man. It was just after that that the man sat on his head. Jones says  he was a big chap, strong and heavy.\"    \"He was in a position to judge, anyhow.\"    \"Of course, he didn't mean to scratch him. He was rather keen on  having that understood. But his fingers came up against the fellow's  cheek as he was falling. So you see we've only got to look for a man  with a scratch on his cheek. It was the right cheek, Jones was almost  certain. I don't see what you're laughing at.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't spring these good things of yours on me  suddenly,\" gurgled Jimmy Silver, rolling about the wooden floor of the  tent. \"You ought to give a chap some warning. Look here,\" he added,  imperatively, \"swear you'll take me with you when you go on your tour  through camp examining everybody's right cheek to see if it's got a  scratch on it.\"    Kennedy began to feel the glow and pride of the successful  sleuth-hound leaking out of him. This aspect of the case had not  occurred to him. The fact that the sentry had scratched his  assailant's right cheek, added to the other indubitable fact that  Walton, of Kay's, was even now walking abroad with a scratch on his  right cheek, had seemed to him conclusive. He had forgotten that there  might be others. Still, it was worth while just to question him. He  questioned him at Cove Reservoir next day.    \"Hullo, Walton,\" he said, with a friendly carelessness which would not  have deceived a prattling infant, \"nasty scratch you've got on your  cheek. How did you get it?\"    \"Perry did it when we were ragging a few days ago,\" replied Walton,  eyeing him distrustfully.    \"Oh,\" said Kennedy.    \"Silly fool,\" said Walton.    \"Talking about me?\" inquired Kennedy politely.    \"No,\" replied Walton, with the suavity of a Chesterfield, \"Perry.\"    They parted, Kennedy with the idea that Walton was his man still more  deeply rooted, Walton with an uncomfortable feeling that Kennedy knew  too much, and that, though he had undoubtedly scored off him for the  moment, a time (as Jimmy Silver was fond of observing with a satanic  laugh) would come, and then--!    He felt that it behoved him to be wary.          VIII    A NIGHT ADVENTURE--THE DETHRONEMENT OF FENN      One of the things which make life on this planet more or less  agreeable is the speed with which alarums, excursions, excitement, and  rows generally, blow over. A nine-days' wonder has to be a big  business to last out its full time nowadays. As a rule the third day  sees the end of it, and the public rushes whooping after some other  hare that has been started for its benefit. The guard-tent row, as far  as the bulk of camp was concerned, lasted exactly two days; at the end  of which period it was generally agreed that all that could be said on  the subject had been said, and that it was now a back number. Nobody,  except possibly the authorities, wanted to find out the authors of the  raid, and even Private Jones had ceased to talk about it--this owing  to the unsympathetic attitude of his tent.    \"Jones,\" the corporal had observed, as the ex-sentry's narrative of  his misfortunes reached a finish for the third time since  _reveille_ that morning, \"if you can't manage to switch off that  infernal chestnut of yours, I'll make you wash up all day and sit on  your head all night.\"    So Jones had withdrawn his yarn from circulation. Kennedy's interest in  detective work waned after his interview with Walton. He was quite sure  that Walton had been one of the band, but it was not his business to  find out;"]]]
