His long yellow fingers reached out for his hornrimmed spectacles  which lay upon a little table beside him. Adjusting them, he pulled the  curtains aside and shuffled silently across the large room.    Mounting the steps to the raised writing-table, he rested his elbows  upon it, and peered down at that curious blotting-pad which had so  provoked the curiosity of Durham. Could Durham have seen it now the  mystery must have been solved. It was an ingenious camera obscura  apparatus, and dimly depicted upon its surface appeared a reproduction  of part of the storehouse beneath! The part of it which was visible  was that touched by the light of an electric torch, carried by a man  crossing the floor in the direction of the lacquered coffin upon the  gilded pedestal!    Old Huang Chow chuckled silently, and his yellow fingers clutched the  table edge as he moved to peer more closely into the picture.    \"Poor fool!\" he whispered in Chinese. \"Poor fool!\"    It was the man who had come with the introduction from Mr. Isaacs--a new  impostor who sought to rob him, who sought to obtain information from  his daughter, who had examined his premises last night, and had even  penetrated upstairs, so that he, old Huang Chow, had been compelled to  disconnect the apparatus and to feign sleep under the scrutiny of the  intruder.    To-night it would be otherwise. To-night it would be otherwise.          X    THE LACQUERED COFFIN        Durham gently raised the trap in the roof of Huang Chow's  treasure-house. He was prepared for snares and pitfalls. No sane man, on  the evidence which he, Durham, had been compelled to leave behind, would  have neglected to fasten the skylight which so obviously afforded a  means of entrance into his premises.    Therefore, he was expected to return. The devilish mechanism was set  ready to receive him. But the artist within him demanded that he should  unmask the mystery with his own hands.    Moreover, he doubted that an official visit, even now, would yield any  results. Old Huang Chow was too cunning for that. If he was to learn how  the man Cohen had died, he must follow the same path to the bitter end.  But there were men on duty round the house, and he believed that he had  placed them so secretly as to deceive even this master of cunning with  whom he was dealing.    He repeated his exploit, dropping with a dull thud upon the cushioned  divan. Then, having lain there listening awhile, he pressed the button  of his torch, and, standing up, crept across the room in the direction  of the stairway.    Here he paused awhile, listening intently. The image of Lala Huang arose  before his mind's eye reproachfully, but he crushed the reproach, and  advanced until he stood beside the lacquered coffin.    He remembered where the key was hidden, and, stooping, he fumbled for a  while and then found it. He was acutely conscious of an unnameable fear.  He felt that he was watched, and yet was unwilling to believe it. The  musty and unpleasant smell which he had noticed before became extremely  perceptible.    He quietly sought for the hidden lock, and, presently finding it,  inserted the key, then paused awhile. He rested his torch upon the  cushions of the divan where the light shone directly upon the coffin.  Then, having his automatic in his left hand, he turned the key.    He had expected now to be able to raise the lid as he had seen Huang  Chow do; but the result was far more surprising.    The lid, together with a second framework of fine netting, flew open  with a resounding bang; and from the interior of the coffin uprose a  most abominable stench.    Durham started back a step, and as he did so witnessed a sight which  turned him sick with horror.    Out on to the edge of the coffin leapt the most gigantic spider which  he had ever seen in his life! It had a body as big as a man's fist, jet  black, with hairy legs like the legs of a crab and a span of a foot or  more!    A moment it poised there, while he swayed, sick with horror. Then,  unhesitatingly, it leapt for his face!    He groaned and fired, missed the horror, but diverted its leap, so that  it fell with a sickening thud a yard behind him. He turned, staggering  back towards the stair, and aware that a light had shone out from  somewhere.    A door had been opened only a few yards from where he stood, and there,  framed in the opening, was Lala Huang, her eyes wide with terror and her  gaze set upon him across the room.    \"You!\" she whispered. \"You!\"    \"Go back!\" he cried hoarsely. \"Go back! Close the door. You don't  understand--close the door!\"    Her gaze set wildly upon him, Lala staggered forward; stopped dead;  looked down at her bare ankle, and then, seeing the thing which had  fastened upon her, uttered a piercing shriek which rang throughout the  place.    At which moment the floor slid away beneath Durham, and he found himself  falling--falling--and then battling for life in evil-smelling water,  amidst absolute darkness.    Police whistles were skirling around the house of Huang Chow. As the  hidden men came running into the court:    \"You heard the shot?\" cried the sergeant in charge. \"I warned him not to  go alone. Don't waste time on the door. One man stay on duty there; the  rest of you follow me.\"    In a few moments, led by the sergeant, the party came dropping heavily  through the skylight into the treasure-house of Huang Chow, in which  every lamp was now alight. A trap was open near the foot of the stairs,  and from beneath it muffled cries proceeded. In this direction the  sergeant headed. Craning over the trap:    \"Hallo, Mr. Durham!\" he called. \"Mr. Durham!\"    \"Get a rope and a ladder,\" came a faint cry from below. \"I can just  touch bottom with my feet and keep my head above water, but the tide's  coming in. Look to the girl, though, first. Look to the girl!\"    The sergeant turned to where, stretched upon a tiger skin before a  half-open door, Lala Huang lay, scantily clothed and white as death.    Upon one of her bare ankles was a discoloured mark.    As the sergeant and another of the men stooped over her a moaning sound  drew their attention to the stair, and there, bent and tottering slowly  down, was old Huang Chow, his eyes peering through the owl-like glasses  vacantly across the room to where his daughter lay.    \"My God!\" whispered the sergeant, upon one knee beside her. He looked  blankly into the face of the other man. \"She's dead!\"    Two plain-clothes men were busy knotting together tapestries and pieces  of rare stuff with which to draw Durham out of the pit; but at these old  Huang Chow looked not at all, but gropingly crossed the room, as if he  saw imperfectly, or could not believe what he saw. At last he reached  the side of the dead girl, stooped, touched her, laid a trembling yellow  hand over her heart, and then stood up again, looking from face to face.    Ignoring the mingled activities about him, he crossed to the open coffin  and began to fumble amongst the putrefying mass of bones and webbing  which lay therein. Out from this he presently drew an iron coffer.    Carrying it across the room he opened the lid. It was full almost to  the top with uncut gems of every variety--diamonds, rubies, sapphires,  emeralds, topaz, amethysts, flashing greenly, redly, whitely. In  handfuls he grasped them and sprinkled them upon the body of the dead  girl.    \"For you,\" he crooned brokenly in Chinese. \"They were all for you!\"    The extemporized rope had just been lowered to Durham, when:    \"My God!\" cried the sergeant, looking over Huang Chow's shoulder.  \"What's that?\"    He had seen the giant spider, the horror from Surinam, which the  Chinaman had reared and fed to guard his treasure and to gratify his  lust for the strange and cruel. The insect, like everything else in  that house, was unusual, almost unique. It was one of the Black Soldier  spiders, by some regarded as a native myth, but actually existing in  Surinam and parts of Brazil. A member of the family, Mygale, its sting  was more quickly and certainly fatal than that of a rattle-snake. Its  instinct was fearlessly to attack any creature, great or small, which  disturbed it in its dark hiding-place.    Now, with feverish, horrible rapidity it was racing up the tapestries on  the other side of the room.    \"Merciful God!\" groaned the sergeant.    Snatching a revolver from his pocket he fired shot after shot. The third  hit the thing but did not kill it. It dropped back upon the floor and  began to crawl toward the coffin. The sergeant ran across and at close  quarters shot it again.    Red blood oozed out from the hideous black body and began to form a deep  stain upon the carpet.    When Durham, drenched but unhurt, was hauled back into the  treasure-house, he did not speak, but, scrambling into the room  stood--pallid--staring dully at old Huang Chow.    Huang Chow, upon his knees beside his daughter, was engaged in  sprinkling priceless jewels over her still body, and murmuring in  Chinese:    \"For you, for you, Lala. They were all for you.\"              KERRY'S KID              I    RED KERRY ON DUTY        Chief Inspector Kerry came down from the top of a motor-bus and stood on  the sidewalk for a while gazing to right and left along Piccadilly.  The night was humid and misty, now threatening fog and now rain. Many  travellers were abroad at this Christmas season, the pleasure seekers  easily to be distinguished from those whom business had detained in  town, and who hurried toward their various firesides. The theatres  were disgorging their audiences. Streams of lighted cars bore parties  supperward; less pretentious taxicabs formed links in the chain.    From the little huddled crowd of more economical theatre-goers who  waited at the stopping place of the motor-buses, Kerry detached himself,  walking slowly along westward and staring reflectively about him."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#8)"],[1,"boundaries: 0 km     Coastline: 116 km     Maritime claims:   exclusive economic zone: 200 nm   territorial sea: 12 nm     International disputes: none     Climate: tropical marine, moderated by southeast trade winds; annual   rainfall averages 124 inches; rainy season from November to April, dry   season from May to October; little seasonal temperature variation     Terrain: five volcanic islands with rugged peaks and limited coastal   plains, two coral atolls (Rose Island, Swains Island)     Natural resources: pumice, pumicite     Land use:   arable land: 10%   permanent crops: 5%   meadows and pastures: 0%   forest and woodland: 75%   other: 10%     Irrigated land: NA sq km     Environment:   current issues: limited natural fresh water resources; in many areas   of the island water supplies come from roof catchments   natural hazards: typhoons common from December to March   international agreements: NA     Note: Pago Pago has one of the best natural deepwater harbors in the   South Pacific Ocean, sheltered by shape from rough seas and protected   by peripheral mountains from high winds; strategic location in the   South Pacific Ocean    @American Samoa:People     Population: 57,366 (July 1995 est.)
