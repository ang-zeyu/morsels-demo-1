So the Europeans who own the mines and  pay the workmen make these laws to protect their workmen, until their  time on the mines is finished, and they can go home to their own  chiefs again.  There are police ready to see that everyone obeys the  laws, and if they find bad people or thieves they take them to a  police-court and lock them up.    In all the other chapters we have read about people living in their  own homes with their own relations.  But in this chapter we read about  Africans who leave their homes to work on the mines.  They work hard  and live a very different life from that lived in their village.  They  see many different people of other countries, hear many languages, and  find out many new things.  But no one wants to make his home there.  High wages are paid for hard work, but everything is strange and  different, and each one longs for his home.  So everyone is glad when  at last his work is done and his wages paid, and he is free to go back  to his own village and the people he loves.  We must remember that  South Africa is a very large country with a great many Africans in it.  Large numbers do go to work on the mines for a time, as we have been  reading, but we must not forget that all these men have their homes in  villages scattered all over that great country.  In these villages  there are chiefs and customs very much like those of Central Africa.  But the great difference between South Africa and Central Africa is  that in cool South Africa Europeans can make their homes, and so the  Africans there see many European customs which they copy.  Trains make  it easy to go from one part of the country to another, and no tribe is  allowed to fight.  Where there is no fighting, people have tried to  learn and to grow wise.  The dark-skinned races of South Africa are  learning to be good workmen, and some to be wise enough to be teachers  and even doctors to serve and help their own people to lead happier  and more useful lives.                                     VII                               -----------                     THE GREAT FARMS OF SOUTH AFRICA                            1. The Two White Races    In the last chapter we read about some of the dark-skinned Africans  who live in South Africa, but we said also that there are many  Europeans living there too.  These Europeans came from two nations in  Europe--the English and the Dutch.  Now in South Africa they live side  by side, doing the same work, and all obeying and helping the  Government of South Africa, which is European.  For many years these  two nations kept separate, but the wisest men in each saw that this  was bad, and they decided to make one strong nation.  When Europeans  go to live in another country, they take all their own customs with  them, and so in South Africa there are cities and houses exactly like  those in their old homes in Europe.  In the towns many people live  together, drawn there by their work.  Some work on mines or railways,  some have shops, some have to keep the town clean and healthy.  In all  European towns there are shops, because in Europe and in India and  China no one can make everything he needs for himself.  Each man  learns to make one thing well, and spends all the day making one kind  of thing.  Then he sells what he has made, and buys from other people  all the other food and clothes he needs.  A country where people work  and live in this way is called civilized.  It is a good way to live,  because people do their work better and have more time to think and  learn from others.  In another book we will read about civilized  countries and the town people of Europe and Asia.  In this chapter we  will read about the Europeans on the great farms of South Africa, who  live far away from the towns.  These people are mostly Dutch or, as  they are sometimes called, Boers, but some of the farmers are English.                            2. What a Farm is Like    Now a farm is a large stretch of land which belongs to one man, who  uses it either to grow food in the ground, or else to raise large  herds of cattle, or horses, or sheep.  In a civilized country people  cannot grow their own food, because they are busy all day with some  other trade.  So some people make it their work to grow large  quantities of food, and sell all they do not need themselves.  Cattle  are kept for their milk, which all Europeans drink.  The flesh of  cattle and sheep is used for food.  The skins of cattle and horses are  dried and made into leather for shoes and harness.  Cattle and horses  are also used to draw heavy carts and ploughs, and for riding long  distances.  A plough is a machine used to break up the ground ready  for sowing seed.  It is quicker and better than a hoe.  Sheep are used  as meat, and are kept especially for their wool.  This is sheared or  cut off every year, and is washed and spun and then woven into cloth.  Woollen cloth is much warmer and stronger than cotton, and in cooler  countries where Europeans can live people always need warm clothes  some months in the year, because the sun is low down in the sky, not  overhead, and the air is cold.  It is quite easy to see how useful  cattle and horses and sheep are in South Africa, and why some people  work to rear large herds.    On other farms where food is grown, some plant wheat or maize for  people to eat; some plant food for cattle to eat.  But a great many  farms grow maize, as this grows better than other grains in South  Africa.  Some parts of this country have great plains or low rolling  hills covered with short grass as far as you can see.  This kind of  land is called the \"veldt.\" In other places there are dry, dusty  plains.  Everywhere there are hills formed of great mounds of huge  stones.  These are called \"kopjes.\" For many months in the year there  is no rain, and the country becomes dusty and the smaller rivers dry  up; then at last the rain comes and the rivers are filled up with  water, and the whole land is covered with grass and flowers.  If at  times the rain is very late in coming, often whole farms are ruined  because the crops wither, or the cattle die, for want of water.                         3. The Farmer and his Family    We said that a farm always belongs to one man, called the farmer.  This man lives with his wife and children in a brick or stone house in  the middle of his land.  Sometimes, when his children grow up, the  sons marry and bring their wives to live in the father's house, while  the daughters go away to live with their husbands on other farms.  The  girls who do not marry still live at home with their father and  mother.  So there are often many people living together in one great  farmhouse.  Each man and woman will have their own room to sleep in,  and everyone will eat together in a big room, not used for sleeping.  In the evening they all sit together to talk about what has been done  during the day.  Outside, not far away, there are huts for the  Africans who work on the farm, and sheds for the cattle and horses and  the carts and ploughs.  The Africans who work on the farms are not  like those who work on the mines for a while and then go home.  The  farm-workers usually make their homes where they work, living there  with their wives and children.  They have as a rule no other village  or chief of their own.  Their wives work in the farmer's house.    All the Europeans have some work to do.  The men see that the  ploughing and sowing is done well, and, because the farm is large,  this takes a long time.  They have to look after the cattle and horses  and sheep, and to take care that their food and water are good and  that their sleeping sheds are clean.  If the cattle get ill, sometimes  a whole herd will die, and the farmer will lose a great deal of money.  The children watch the herds while they are grazing, and take care  they do not stray too far away.  The women have to see after the  household.  There are always African women servants to help, but there  is a great deal of work in a European house.  In every room there are  many chairs and tables which have to be moved when the room is swept.  On all the beds there are blankets and white cotton sheets.  A white  cloth is spread on the table when food is to be eaten.  Europeans wear  many clothes.  All these have to be washed whenever they are dirty,  and so one person will be kept busy all day washing and ironing if  there are many people living on a farm.    Then Europeans eat three or four times a day, and have many different  kinds of food.  Maize or wheat flour is made into bread or cakes.  Meat is either roasted or boiled, and is often eaten with green  vegetables.  Sometimes meat and vegetables are cut up into small  pieces and all boiled together for a long time.  Then it is called  soup, and is eaten with a spoon.  Milk from the cattle is used to  drink, and is also made into butter and cheese, which are hard, and  can be eaten with bread.  Europeans drink coffee like the Arabs, or  tea which is made from the leaves of another plant.  When mealtime  comes all the family come to the big room where a large table is  covered with a white cloth.  The food is brought in a large bowl or  dish, and the farmer or his wife puts some on a plate for each person.  Europeans use knives and forks and spoons in eating food.  The men and  women and children all sit together round the table.  On the farms as  a rule there is no wood or coal to make fires, so the sweepings of the  cattle-shed are made into cakes and dried in the sun.  This makes very  good fuel for fires.                         4. How South Africa is Ruled    The Europeans on the farms do not see many other people, as the farms  are very large and are long distances apart.  Sometimes the men have  to go to town to sell their grain or cattle and to buy other things,  but they cannot leave their work very often.

Harriet's conversion took place in the summer of 1825, when  she was fourteen, and the following year, April, 1826, Dr. Beecher  resigned his pastorate in Litchfield to accept a call to the Hanover  Street Church, Boston, Mass. In a letter to her grandmother Foote at  Guilford, dated Hartford, March 4, 1826, Harriet writes:--    \"You have probably heard that our home in Litchfield is broken up.  Papa has received a call to Boston, and concluded to accept, because  he could not support his family in Litchfield. He was dismissed last  week Tuesday, and will be here (Hartford) next Tuesday with mamma and  Isabel. Aunt Esther will take Charles and Thomas to her house for the  present. Papa's salary is to be $2,000 and $500 settlement.    \"I attend school constantly and am making some progress in my studies.  I devote most of my attention to Latin and to arithmetic, and hope soon  to prepare myself to assist Catherine in the school.\"    This breaking up of the Litchfield home led Harriet, under her  father's advice, to seek to connect herself with the First Church of  Hartford. Accordingly, accompanied by two of her school friends, she  went one day to the pastor's study to consult with him concerning the  contemplated step. The good man listened attentively to the child's  simple and modest statement of Christian experience, and then with an  awful, though kindly, solemnity of speech and manner said, \"Harriet,  do you feel that if the universe should be destroyed (awful pause)  you could be happy with God alone?\" After struggling in vain, in her  mental bewilderment, to fix in her mind some definite conception of the  meaning of the sounds which fell on her ear like the measured strokes  of a bell, the child of fourteen stammered out, \"Yes, sir.\"    \"You realize, I trust,\" continued the doctor, \"in some measure at  least, the deceitfulness of your heart, and that in punishment for your  sins God might justly leave you to make yourself as miserable as you  have made yourself sinful?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" again stammered Harriet.    Having thus effectually, and to his own satisfaction, fixed the child's  attention on the morbid and over-sensitive workings of her own heart,  the good and truly kind-hearted man dismissed her with a fatherly  benediction. But where was the joyous ecstasy of that beautiful Sabbath  morning of a year ago? Where was that heavenly friend? Yet was not  this as it should be, and might not God leave her \"to make herself as  miserable as she had made herself sinful\"?    In a letter addressed to her brother Edward, about this time, she  writes: \"My whole life is one continued struggle: I do nothing right.  I yield to temptation almost as soon as it assails me. My deepest  feelings are very evanescent. I am beset behind and before, and my sins  take away all my happiness. But that which most constantly besets me is  pride--I can trace almost all my sins back to it.\"    In the mean time, the school is prospering. February 16, 1827,  Catherine writes to Dr. Beecher: \"My affairs go on well. The stock is  all taken up, and next week I hope to have out the prospectus of the  'Hartford Female Seminary.' I hope the building will be done, and all  things in order, by June. The English lady is coming with twelve pupils  from New York.\" Speaking of Harriet, who was at this time with her  father in Boston, she adds: \"I have received some letters from Harriet  to-day which make me feel uneasy. She says, 'I don't know as I am fit  for anything, and I have thought that I could wish to die young, and  let the remembrance of me and my faults perish in the grave, rather  than live, as I fear I do, a trouble to every one. You don't know how  perfectly wretched I often feel: so useless, so weak, so destitute of  all energy. Mamma often tells me that I am a strange, inconsistent  being. Sometimes I could not sleep, and have groaned and cried till  midnight, while in the daytime I tried to appear cheerful and succeeded  so well that papa reproved me for laughing so much. I was so absent  sometimes that I made strange mistakes, and then they all laughed at  me, and I laughed, too, though I felt as though I should go distracted.  I wrote rules; made out a regular system for dividing my time; but  my feelings vary so much that it is almost impossible for me to be  regular.'\"    But let Harriet \"take courage in her dark sorrows and melancholies,\" as  Carlyle says: \"Samuel Johnson too had hypochondrias; all great souls  are apt to have, and to be in thick darkness generally till the eternal  ways and the celestial guiding stars disclose themselves, and the vague  abyss of life knits itself up into firmaments for them.\"    At the same time (the winter of 1827), Catherine writes to Edward  concerning Harriet: \"If she could come here (Hartford) it might be the  best thing for her, for she can talk freely to me. I can get her books,  and Catherine Cogswell, Georgiana May, and her friends here could do  more for her than any one in Boston, for they love her and she loves  them very much. Georgiana's difficulties are different from Harriet's:  she is speculating about doctrines, etc. Harriet will have young  society here all the time, which she cannot have at home, and I think  cheerful and amusing friends will do much for her. I can do better in  preparing her to teach drawing than any one else, for I best know what  is needed.\"    It was evidently necessary that something should be done to restore  Harriet to a more tranquil and healthful frame of mind; consequently in  the spring of 1827, accompanied by her friend Georgiana May, she went  to visit her grandmother Foote at Nut Plains, Guilford. Miss May refers  to this visit in a letter to Mrs. Foote, in January of the following  winter.                                            HARTFORD, _January 4, 1828._        DEAR MRS. FOOTE:--... I very often think of you and      the happy hours I passed at your house last spring.      It seems as if it were but yesterday: now, while I am      writing, I can see your pleasant house and the familiar      objects around you as distinctly as the day I left      them. Harriet and I are very much the same girls we      were then. I do not believe we have altered very much,      though she is improved in some respects.    The August following this visit to Guilford Harriet writes to her  brother Edward in a vein which is still streaked with sadness, but  shows some indication of returning health of mind.    \"Many of my objections you did remove that afternoon we spent together.  After that I was not as unhappy as I had been. I felt, nevertheless,  that my views were very indistinct and contradictory, and feared that  if you left me thus I might return to the same dark, desolate state  in which I had been all summer. I felt that my immortal interest,  my happiness for both worlds, was depending on the turn my feelings  might take. In my disappointment and distress I called upon God, and  it seemed as if I was heard. I felt that He could supply the loss of  all earthly love. All misery and darkness were over. I felt as if  restored, nevermore to fall. Such sober certainty of waking bliss had  long been a stranger to me. But even then I had doubts as to whether  these feelings were right, because I felt love to God alone without  that ardent love for my fellow-creatures which Christians have often  felt.... I cannot say exactly what it is makes me reluctant to speak  of my feelings. It costs me an effort to express feeling of any kind,  but more particularly to speak of my private religious feelings. If any  one questions me, my first impulse is to conceal all I can. As for  expression of affection towards my brothers and sisters, my companions  or friends, the stronger the affection the less inclination have I to  express it. Yet sometimes I think myself the most frank, open, and  communicative of beings, and at other times the most reserved. If you  can resolve all these caprices into general principles, you will do  more than I can. Your speaking so much philosophically has a tendency  to repress confidence. We never wish to have our feelings analyzed  down; and very little, nothing, that we say brought to the test of  mathematical demonstration.    \"It appears to me that if I only could adopt the views of God you  presented to my mind, they would exert a strong and beneficial  influence over my character. But I am afraid to accept them for several  reasons. First, it seems to be taking from the majesty and dignity  of the divine character to suppose that his happiness can be at all  affected by the conduct of his sinful, erring creatures. Secondly, it  seems to me that such views of God would have an effect on our own  minds in lessening that reverence and fear which is one of the greatest  motives to us for action. For, although to a generous mind the thought  of the love of God would be a sufficient incentive to action, there are  times of coldness when that love is not felt, and then there remains no  sort of stimulus. I find as I adopt these sentiments I feel less fear  of God, and, in view of sin, I feel only a sensation of grief which is  more easily dispelled and forgotten than that I formerly felt.\"    A letter dated January 3, 1828, shows us that Harriet had returned to  Hartford and was preparing herself to teach drawing and painting, under  the direction of her sister Catherine.        MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER,--I should have written before to      assure you of my remembrance of you, but I have been      constantly employed, from nine in the morning till      after dark at night, in taking lessons of a painting      and drawing master, with only an intermission long      enough to swallow a little dinner which was sent to me      in the school-room. You may easily believe that after      spending the day in this manner, I did not"]]]
