Perhaps the  charms of Tahiti reconciled them.    This design Cook triumphantly carried out; though shortly after leaving  southern latitudes he was so ill of what he describes as a bilious  cholic, that his life was despaired of. He first searched for, and  visited, Davis' discovery of Easter Island, where he examined and  described the wonderful colossal, though rude, statues there found. He  then went to the Marquesas, a group but little known, where, after the  usual attempt of the natives to appropriate sundry articles, and the  consequent necessity of firing upon them, peaceful relations were  established, and a brisk trade in much-wanted refreshments was set up.  This did not last long, however, as the market was spoiled by some red  feathers, obtained at the Friendly Islands, being given for a pig; after  which nothing would buy provisions but these same red feathers, and these  being scarce, trade ceased. Cook therefore sailed once more for Tahiti.    On his way he touched at some of the coral atolls of the innumerable  Paumotu Group, and arrived at Matavai on April 22nd, again with not a  sick man on board.    Three weeks were spent here with much satisfaction to all. Provisions  were in plenty, the king and people very friendly, and all went well. The  islanders were preparing for an attack on Eimeo, a neighbouring island,  and a gathering of the fleets gave Cook an opportunity of learning much  of their naval power and manner of conducting war. He observed that the  general prosperity of Tahiti seemed to be at a much higher point than on  his former visit.    After another three weeks' stay at Huaheine, and Ulietea, also amongst  old friends, the Resolution sailed on June 4th to the west.    Discovering Palmerston and Savage Islands on the way, she called at  Namuka, one of the Friendly Group, thus extending the knowledge of those  islands gained the year before. Thence Cook sailed west, discovering  Turtle Island, but just passing out of sight to the southward of the  large Fiji Group, and thus lost the chance of adding them to his other  finds.    He was now bound for the New Hebrides, of which the northern island had  been discovered by Quiros. Bougainville, the French explorer, had, in  1768, passed just south of Quiros' Island, and named one or two others he  sighted, but had made no stay, and knew nothing of the extent of the  Group.    This was not Cook's fashion. He explored and circumnavigated the whole  Group, which extends in a long line for three hundred and fifty miles. He  touched first at Mallicolo, where, after a temporary disagreement,  friendship was formed. Passing Sandwich Island, Erromanga was landed  upon; but the suspicion of the natives here impelled them to attack the  boats, and no intercourse was established.    The ship then anchored in the convenient harbour of Resolution Bay in the  island of Tanna, and remained a fortnight, wooding and watering.  Observations on the hot springs that gush from the side of the volcano  bordering the harbour were made, and the relations with the natives were  altogether friendly. Sighting Anityeum, the southern member of the New  Hebrides, and making sure there was nothing beyond it, Cook returned  along the west side of the islands, passing eastward of them again,  between Mallicolo and Espiritu Santo. The latter island was closely  followed round its whole extent, and Quiros' Bay of St. Philip and St.  James identified in the great inlet in the northern side. Having laid  down the whole of this extensive group of islands, and very accurately  fixed the longitude by many lunar observations, Cook, on August 31st,  sailed to the westward to search for more lands.    His chart of the New Hebrides is still, for some of the islands, the only  one; and wherever superseded by more recent surveys the general accuracy  of his work, both in outline and position, is very remarkable. On several  occasions up to the present year (1893) Cook's recorded positions have  saved the adoption of so-called amendments reported by passing ships,  which would have been anything but amendments in reality.    Four days after leaving the New Hebrides Cook discovered New Caledonia.  He explored the whole of the eastern side of this large island, which is  three hundred miles in length, anchoring in one harbour inside the reefs  which border it, and making friends with the natives. Other attempts to  get inside the reefs were, however, unsuccessful, and after several  narrow escapes from shipwreck Cook gave up, to his regret, a complete  circumnavigation of the island. The summer approaching, he wished to  refit and recruit in New Zealand before once more standing south.    Norfolk Island was discovered and landed upon on the way, and Queen  Charlotte's Sound was once more reached on October 19th.    The Adventure's visit was ascertained from the Maoris, but Cook was much  puzzled by incompletely understood accounts of white men having been  killed. As far as could be gathered a ship had been lost on the coast,  and Cook was led to believe that this disaster had no reference to the  Adventure.    It was found that pigs and fowls left here on the former visit were still  in existence, and presumably thriving. It may here be mentioned, that  wherever Cook touched he invariably, so far as his stock allowed, left  animals to stock the country, and that New Zealand was, when the settlers  eventually came, found to be well supplied with pigs.    After a stay of three weeks the Resolution sailed, on November 10th, for  Cape Horn. She kept farther north than on the last occasion, the object  being to pass over new ground, and more completely disprove the existence  of any land.    The western part of Tierra del Fuego being reached, Cook followed the  shore to the south-east, mapping the outside of this dangerous and  inhospitable archipelago. On December 20th he put in to what he  afterwards called Christmas Sound, where large numbers of kelp geese were  obtained, giving the crew what Cook describes as a dainty Christmas  feast, though the flesh of these birds is as tough, fishy, and  unpalatable as can well be imagined; on this occasion, however, the  seamen seemed to have concurred in the verdict of their omnivorous  commander, to whom nothing ever came amiss. Be it remembered, however,  how long they had been on salt provisions, and that the South Sea  Islands, though pleasant in many respects, produced but little solid  food--no beef, mutton, or flesh of any quadruped but pigs, and those in  not very great plenty--while New Zealand gave them nothing but fish.    Rounding Cape Horn, he passed through the Strait Le Maire, and followed  the north shore of Staten Island, anchoring at one place to obtain seals  and birds.    Whilst praising the flavour of a young seal cub, Cook is compelled to  admit that the flesh of an old sea lion is abominable; a remarkable  statement as coming from him.    Leaving Staten Island, Cook steered east and discovered South Georgia,  named after the king. He followed the north coast of this desolate and  ice-clad island, obtaining more refreshment in the shape of seals,  penguins, and shags--unpalatable, but welcome food to men who had so long  subsisted on bad salt meat. From South Georgia the ship's head was once  more turned southwards, and before many days ice was again encountered.  In stormy and thick weather the Resolution made her way, disproving the  existence of a great tract of land laid down by speculative geographers,  until January 31st, 1775, when Sandwich Land was discovered in about  latitude 60 degrees south. This ice-covered group of islands was sketched  under great difficulties from gales, fogs, snow, and numerous icebergs;  and Cook then bore away along their parallel, to seek once more for  Bouvet's Islands to the eastward.    He found nothing, and on February 26th steered for the Cape of Good Hope,  even he being glad to leave this trying, tempestuous latitude. On March  23rd he anchored in Table Bay, having learnt from some vessels outside of  the safe arrival of the Adventure in England the year before, and of her  boat's crew having been eaten by the Maoris, which cleared up the mystery  of the wrecked ship.    The Resolution finally arrived at Spithead on July 29th, 1775, after an  absence of three years and eighteen days.    Captain Furneaux had, on leaving New Zealand, sailed straight for Cape  Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, and England, arriving just a year before the  Resolution.    Cook speaks most warmly of Captain Furneaux; but one cannot help  contrasting his action with Cook's. Left, by the separation, his own  master, he might have continued exploration, as did Cook. His ship was  staunch, his provisions in much the same condition as the Resolution's;  but he went straight home. His crew had suffered from scurvy, whereas  Cook's had not; but he says not one word of this, nor does he give any  reason why he gave up any further thought of the objects of the voyage,  except a search for Bouvet's Islands, which he also looked for on his  way.    It was the indomitable perseverance that led Cook to act so differently  that raised his reputation so far above all other leaders.    Thus ended this very remarkable voyage. Never was a"]]]
