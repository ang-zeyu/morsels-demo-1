From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,    I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and              blood,    Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and              side-falling head,    His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the              bloody stump,    And has not yet look'd on it.      I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,    But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,    And the yellow-blue countenance see.      I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,    Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so              offensive,    While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.      I am faithful, I do not give out,    The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,    These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a              fire, a burning flame.)    4      Thus in silence in dreams' projections,    Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,    The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,    I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,    Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,    (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and              rested,    Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)

Long, too long America,    Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and              prosperity only,    But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish, advancing,              grappling with direst fate and recoiling not,    And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en-masse              really are,    (For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse              really are?)          GIVE ME THE SPLENDID SILENT SUN.      1      Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,    Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,    Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,    Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,    Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching              content,    Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the              Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,    Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can              walk undisturb'd,    Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never              tire,    Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the              world a rural domestic life,    Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own              ears only,    Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal              sanities!      These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and              rack'd by the war-strife,)    These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,    While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,    Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,    Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me up,    Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me forever              faces;    (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,    I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)    2      Keep your splendid silent sun,    Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,    Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and              orchards,    Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;    Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and              endless along the trottoirs!    Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and lovers              by the thousand!    Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every              day!    Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!    Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of              the trumpets and drums!    (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush'd              and reckless,    Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very              old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)    Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!    O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!    The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!    The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the              torchlight procession!    The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons              following;    People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,    Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as              now,    The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even              the sight of the wounded,)    Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!    Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.          DIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS.            The last sunbeam    Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,    On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,        Down a new-made double grave.          Lo, the moon ascending,    Up from the east the silvery round moon,    Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,        Immense and silent moon.          I see a sad procession,    And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,    All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,        As with voices and with tears.          I hear the great drums pounding,    And the small drums steady whirring,    And every blow of the great convulsive drums,        Strikes me through and through.          For the son is brought with the father,    (In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,    Two veterans son and father dropt together,        And the double grave awaits them.)          Now nearer blow the bugles,    And the drums strike more convulsive,    And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,        And the strong dead-march enwraps me.          In the eastern sky up-buoying,    The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,    ('Tis some mother's large transparent face,        In heaven brighter growing.)          O strong dead-march you please me!    O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!    O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!        What I have I also give you.          The moon gives you light,    And the bugles and the drums give you music,    And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,        My heart gives you love.

Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,    You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the              earth.      No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,    If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.    One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,    From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese, shall be              friends triune,    More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.      To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,    Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.      It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly              affection,    The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,    The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,    The continuance of equality shall be comrades.      These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,    I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.      (Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?

I saw old General at bay,    (Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)    His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works,    He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines, a desperate              emergency,    I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or three              were selected,    I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen'd with care, the              adjutant was very grave,    I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.

While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,    And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight              passes,    And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the              breath of my infant,    There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;    The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,    The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the              irregular snap! snap!    I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short _t-h-t!              t-h-t!_ of the rifle-balls,    I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the              great shells shrieking as they pass,    The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees              (tumultuous now the contest rages,)    All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,    The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,    The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of              the right time,    After firing I see him lean aside and look "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/884"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 3 (#8)"],[1,"the  strength of the rumour, a believer in all the wondrous tales told of  Nicholas Flamel bought the house, and nearly pulled it to pieces in  ransacking the walls and wainscotting for hidden gold.

While alchymy was thus cultivated on the continent of Europe, it was not  neglected in the isles of Britain. Since the time of Roger Bacon, it had  fascinated the imagination of many ardent men in England. In the year  1404, an act of parliament was passed, declaring the making of gold  and silver to be felony. Great alarm was felt at that time lest any  alchymist should succeed in his projects, and perhaps bring ruin upon  the state, by furnishing boundless wealth to some designing tyrant, who  would make use of it to enslave his country. This alarm appears to have  soon subsided; for, in the year 1455, King Henry VI, by advice of his  council and parliament, granted four successive patents and commissions  to several knights, citizens of London, chemists, monks, mass-priests,  and others, to find out the philosopher's stone and elixir, \"to the  great benefit,\" said the patent, \"of the realm, and the enabling of the  King to pay all the debts of the Crown in real gold and silver.\" Prinn,  in his \"Aurum Reginae,\" observes, as a note to this passage, that the  King's reason for granting this patent to ecclesiastics was, that they  were such good artists in transubstantiating bread and wine in the  Eucharist, and therefore the more likely to be able to effect the  transmutation of baser metals into better. No gold, of course, was ever  made; and, next year, the King, doubting very much of the practicability  of the thing, took further advice, and appointed a commission of ten  learned men, and persons of eminence, to judge and certify to him  whether the transmutation of metals were a thing practicable or no. It  does not appear whether the commission ever made any report upon the  subject.    In the succeeding reign, an alchymist appeared who pretended to have  discovered the secret. This was George Ripley, the canon of Bridlington,  in Yorkshire. He studied for twenty years in the universities of Italy,  and was a great favourite with Pope Innocent VIII, who made him one of  his domestic chaplains, and master of the ceremonies in his household.  Returning to England in 1477, he dedicated to King Edward IV. his famous  work, \"The Compound of Alchymy; or, the Twelve Gates leading to the  Discovery of the Philosopher's Stone.\" These gates he described to  be calcination, solution, separation, conjunction, putrefaction,  congelation, cibation, sublimation, fermentation, exaltation,  multiplication, and projection! to which he might have added  botheration, the most important process of all. He was very rich, and  allowed it to be believed that he could make gold out of iron. Fuller,  in his \"Worthies of England,\" says that an English gentleman of good  credit reported that, in his travels abroad, he saw a record in the  island of Malta, which declared that Ripley gave yearly to the knights  of that island, and of Rhodes, the enormous sum of one hundred thousand  pounds sterling, to enable them to carry on the war against the  Turks. In his old age, he became an anchorite near Boston, and wrote  twenty-five volumes upon the subject of alchymy, the most important of  which is the \"Duodecim Portarum,\" already mentioned. Before he died, he  seems to have acknowledged that he had misspent his life in this vain  study, and requested that all men, when they met with any of his books,  would burn them, or afford them no credit, as they had been written  merely from his opinion, and not from proof; and that subsequent trial  had made manifest to him that they were false and vain. [Fuller's  \"Worthies of England.\"]      BASIL VALENTINE.    Germany also produced many famous alchymists in the fifteenth century,  the chief of whom are Basil Valentine, Bernard of Treves, and the Abbot  Trithemius. Basil Valentine was born at Mayence, and was made prior of  St. Peter's, at Erfurt, about the year 1414. It was known, during his  life, that he diligently sought the philosopher's stone, and that he had  written some works upon the process of transmutation. They were thought,  for many years, to be lost; but were, after his death, discovered  enclosed in the stone work of one of the pillars in the Abbey. They were  twenty-one in number, and are fully set forth in the third volume of  Lenglet's \"History of the Hermetic Philosophy.\" The alchymists asserted,  that Heaven itself conspired to bring to light these extraordinary  works; and that the pillar in which they were enclosed was miraculously  shattered by a thunderbolt; and that, as soon as the manuscripts were  liberated, the pillar closed up again of its own accord!      BERNARD of TREVES.    The life of this philosopher is a remarkable instance of talent and  perseverance misapplied. In the search of his chimera nothing could  daunt him. Repeated disappointment never diminished his hopes; and, from  the age of fourteen to that of eighty-five, he was incessantly employed  among the drugs and furnaces of his laboratory, wasting his life with  the view of prolonging it, and reducing himself to beggary in the hopes  of growing rich.    He was born at either Treves or Padua, in the year 1406. His father is  said by some to have been a physician in the latter city; and by others,  to have been Count of the Marches of Treves, and one of the most wealthy  nobles of his country. At all events, whether noble or physician, he  was a rich man, and left his son a magnificent estate. At the age of  fourteen he first became enamoured of the science of alchymy, and read  the Arabian authors in their own language. He himself has left a  most interesting record of his labours and wanderings, from which the  following particulars are chiefly extracted:--The first book which fell  into his hands, was that of the Arabian philosopher, Rhazes, from  the reading of which he imagined that he had discovered the means  of augmenting gold a hundred fold. For four years he worked in his  laboratory, with the book of Rhazes continually before him. At the end  of that time, he found that he had spent no less than eight hundred  crowns upon his experiment, and had got nothing but fire and smoke for  his pains. He now began to lose confidence in Rhazes, and turned to the  works of Geber. He studied him assiduously for two years; and, being  young, rich, and credulous, was beset by all the chymists of the town,  who kindly assisted him in spending his money. He did not lose his faith  in Geber, or patience with his hungry assistants, until he had lost two  thousand crowns--a very considerable sum in those days.    Among all the crowd of pretended men of science who surrounded him,  there was but one as enthusiastic and as disinterested as himself. With  this man, who was a monk of the order of St. Francis, he contracted  an intimate friendship, and spent nearly all his time. Some obscure  treatises of Rupecissa and Sacrobosco having fallen into their hands,  they were persuaded, from reading them, that highly rectified spirits  of wine was the universal alkahest, or dissolvent, which would aid them  greatly in the process of transmutation. They rectified the alcohol  thirty times, till they made it so strong as to burst the vessels which  contained it. After they had worked three years, and spent three hundred  crowns in the liquor, they discovered that they were on the wrong track.  They next tried alum and copperas; but the great secret still escaped  them. They afterwards imagined that there was a marvellous virtue in  all excrement, especially the human, and actually employed more than two  years in experimentalizing upon it, with mercury, salt, and molten lead!  Again the adepts flocked around him from far and near, to aid him with  their counsels. He received them all hospitably, and divided his wealth  among them so generously and unhesitatingly, that they gave him the name  of the \"good Trevisan,\" by which he is still often mentioned in works  that treat on alchymy. For twelve years he led this life, making  experiments every day upon some new substance, and praying to God night  and morning that he might discover the secret of transmutation.    In this interval he lost his friend the monk, and was joined by a  magistrate of the city of Treves, as ardent as himself in the search.  His new acquaintance imagined that the ocean was the mother of gold,  and that sea-salt would change lead or iron into the precious metals.  Bernard resolved to try; and, transporting his laboratory to a house  on the coast of the Baltic, he worked upon salt for more than a year,  melting it, sublimating it, crystalizing it, and occasionally drinking  it, for the sake of other experiments. Still the strange enthusiast was  not wholly discouraged, and his failure in one trial only made him the  more anxious to attempt another.    He was now approaching the age of fifty, and had as yet seen nothing of  the world. He, therefore, determined to travel through Germany, Italy,  France, and Spain. Wherever he stopped he made inquiries whether there  were any alchymists in the neighbourhood. He invariably sought them out;  and, if they were poor, relieved, and, if affluent, encouraged them. At  Citeaux he became acquainted with one Geoffrey Leuvier, a monk of that  place, who persuaded him that the essence of egg-shells was a valuable  ingredient. He tried, therefore, what could be done; and was only  prevented from wasting a year or two on the experiment by the opinions  of an attorney, at Berghem, in Flanders, who said that the great secret  resided in vinegar and copperas. He was not convinced of the absurdity  of this idea until he had nearly poisoned himself. He resided in France  for about five years, when,"]]]
