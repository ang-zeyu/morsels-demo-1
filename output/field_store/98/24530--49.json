The epoch of trusts had ended in The  Great Trust. In a word, the people of the United States concluded to  assume the conduct of their own business, just as one hundred odd years  before they had assumed the conduct of their own government, organizing  now for industrial purposes on precisely the same grounds that they had  then organized for political purposes. At last, strangely late in the  world's history, the obvious fact was perceived that no business is so  essentially the public business as the industry and commerce on which  the people's livelihood depends, and that to entrust it to private  persons to be managed for private profit is a folly similar in kind,  though vastly greater in magnitude, to that of surrendering the  functions of political government to kings and nobles to be conducted  for their personal glorification.\"    \"Such a stupendous change as you describe,\" said I, \"did not, of  course, take place without great bloodshed and terrible convulsions.\"    \"On the contrary,\" replied Dr. Leete, \"there was absolutely no  violence. The change had been long foreseen. Public opinion had become  fully ripe for it, and the whole mass of the people was behind it.  There was no more possibility of opposing it by force than by argument.  On the other hand the popular sentiment toward the great corporations  and those identified with them had ceased to be one of bitterness, as  they came to realize their necessity as a link, a transition phase, in  the evolution of the true industrial system. The most violent foes of  the great private monopolies were now forced to recognize how  invaluable and indispensable had been their office in educating the  people up to the point of assuming control of their own business. Fifty  years before, the consolidation of the industries of the country under  national control would have seemed a very daring experiment to the most  sanguine. But by a series of object lessons, seen and studied by all  men, the great corporations had taught the people an entirely new set  of ideas on this subject. They had seen for many years syndicates  handling revenues greater than those of states, and directing the  labors of hundreds of thousands of men with an efficiency and economy  unattainable in smaller operations. It had come to be recognized as an  axiom that the larger the business the simpler the principles that can  be applied to it; that, as the machine is truer than the hand, so the  system, which in a great concern does the work of the master's eye in a  small business, turns out more accurate results. Thus it came about  that, thanks to the corporations themselves, when it was proposed that  the nation should assume their functions, the suggestion implied  nothing which seemed impracticable even to the timid. To be sure it was  a step beyond any yet taken, a broader generalization, but the very  fact that the nation would be the sole corporation in the field would,  it was seen, relieve the undertaking of many difficulties with which  the partial monopolies had contended.\"        Chapter 6    Dr. Leete ceased speaking, and I remained silent, endeavoring to form  some general conception of the changes in the arrangements of society  implied in the tremendous revolution which he had described.    Finally I said, \"The idea of such an extension of the functions of  government is, to say the least, rather overwhelming.\"    \"Extension!\" he repeated, \"where is the extension?\"    \"In my day,\" I replied, \"it was considered that the proper functions of  government, strictly speaking, were limited to keeping the peace and  defending the people against the public enemy, that is, to the military  and police powers.\"    \"And, in heaven's name, who are the public enemies?\" exclaimed Dr.  Leete. \"Are they France, England, Germany, or hunger, cold, and  nakedness? In your day governments were accustomed, on the slightest  international misunderstanding, to seize upon the bodies of citizens  and deliver them over by hundreds of thousands to death and mutilation,  wasting their treasures the while like water; and all this oftenest for  no imaginable profit to the victims. We have no wars now, and our  governments no war powers, but in order to protect every citizen  against hunger, cold, and nakedness, and provide for all his physical  and mental needs, the function is assumed of directing his industry for  a term of years. No, Mr. West, I am sure on reflection you will  perceive that it was in your age, not in ours, that the extension of  the functions of governments was extraordinary. Not even for the best  ends would men now allow their governments such powers as were then  used for the most maleficent.\"    \"Leaving comparisons aside,\" I said, \"the demagoguery and corruption of  our public men would have been considered, in my day, insuperable  objections to any assumption by government of the charge of the  national industries. We should have thought that no arrangement could  be worse than to entrust the politicians with control of the  wealth-producing machinery of the country. Its material interests were  quite too much the football of parties as it was.\"    \"No doubt you were right,\" rejoined Dr. Leete, \"but all that is changed  now. We have no parties or politicians, and as for demagoguery and  corruption, they are words having only an historical significance.\"    \"Human nature itself must have changed very much,\" I said.    \"Not at all,\" was Dr. Leete's reply, \"but the conditions of human life  have changed, and with them the motives of human action. The  organization of society with you was such that officials were under a  constant temptation to misuse their power for the private profit of  themselves or others. Under such circumstances it seems almost strange  that you dared entrust them with any of your affairs. Nowadays, on the  contrary, society is so constituted that there is absolutely no way in  which an official, however ill-disposed, could possibly make any profit  for himself or any one else by a misuse of his power. Let him be as bad  an official as you please, he cannot be a corrupt one. There is no  motive to be. The social system no longer offers a premium on  dishonesty. But these are matters which you can only understand as you  come, with time, to know us better.\"    \"But you have not yet told me how you have settled the labor problem.  It is the problem of capital which we have been discussing,\" I said.  \"After the nation had assumed conduct of the mills, machinery,  railroads, farms, mines, and capital in general of the country, the  labor question still remained. In assuming the responsibilities of  capital the nation had assumed the difficulties of the capitalist's  position.\"    \"The moment the nation assumed the responsibilities of capital those  difficulties vanished,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"The national organization  of labor under one direction was the complete solution of what was, in  your day and under your system, justly regarded as the insoluble labor  problem. When the nation became the sole employer, all the citizens, by  virtue of their citizenship, became employees, to be distributed  according to the needs of industry.\"    \"That is,\" I suggested, \"you have simply applied the principle of  universal military service, as it was understood in our day, to the  labor question.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dr. Leete, \"that was something which followed as a matter  of course as soon as the nation had become the sole capitalist. The  people were already accustomed to the idea that the obligation of every  citizen, not physically disabled, to contribute his military services  to the defense of the nation was equal and absolute. That it was  equally the duty of every citizen to contribute his quota of industrial  or intellectual services to the maintenance of the nation was equally  evident, though it was not until the nation became the employer of  labor that citizens were able to render this sort of service with any  pretense either of universality or equity. No organization of labor was  possible when the employing power was divided among hundreds or  thousands of individuals and corporations, between which concert of any  kind was neither desired, nor indeed feasible. It constantly happened  then that vast numbers who desired to labor could find no opportunity,  and on the other hand, those who desired to evade a part or all of  their debt could easily do so.\"    \"Service, now, I suppose, is compulsory upon all,\" I suggested.    \"It is rather a matter of course than of compulsion,\" replied Dr.  Leete. \"It is regarded as so absolutely natural and reasonable that the  idea of its being compulsory has ceased to be thought of. He would be  thought to be an incredibly contemptible person who should need  compulsion in such a case. Nevertheless, to speak of service being  compulsory would be a weak way to state its absolute inevitableness.  Our entire social order is so wholly based upon and deduced from it  that if it were conceivable that a man could escape it, he would be  left with no possible way to provide for his existence. He would have  excluded himself from the world, cut himself off from his kind, in a  word, committed suicide.\"    \"Is the term of service in this industrial army for life?\"    \"Oh, no; it both begins later and ends earlier than the average working  period in your day. Your workshops were filled with children and old  men, but we hold the period of youth sacred to education, and the  period of maturity, when the physical forces begin to flag, equally  sacred to ease and agreeable relaxation. The period of industrial  service is twenty-four years, beginning at the close of the course of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#8)"],[1,"always delighted in holding  social commune with learned men and lovers of books, yet when we  prospered in the world and made acquaintance with the King's majesty  and were received into his household, we obtained ampler facilities for  visiting everywhere as we would, and of hunting as it were certain most  choice preserves, libraries private as well as public, and of the  regular as well as of the secular clergy.  And indeed while we filled  various offices to the victorious Prince and splendidly triumphant King  of England, Edward the Third from the Conquest--whose reign may the  Almighty long and peacefully continue--first those about his court, but  then those concerning the public affairs of his kingdom, namely the  offices of Chancellor and Treasurer, there was afforded to us, in  consideration of the royal favour, easy access for the purpose of  freely searching the retreats of books.  In fact, the fame of our love  of them had been soon winged abroad everywhere, and we were reported to  burn with such desire for books, and especially old ones, that it was  more easy for any man to gain our favour by means of books than of  money.  Wherefore, since supported by the goodness of the aforesaid  prince of worthy memory, we were able to requite a man well or ill, to  benefit or injure mightily great as well as small, there flowed in,  instead of presents and guerdons, and instead of gifts and jewels,  soiled tracts and battered codices, gladsome alike to our eye and  heart.  Then the aumbries of the most famous monasteries were thrown  open, cases were unlocked and caskets were undone, and volumes that had  slumbered through long ages in their tombs wake up and are astonished,  and those that had lain hidden in dark places are bathed in the ray of  unwonted light.  These long lifeless books, once most dainty, but now  become corrupt and loathsome, covered with litters of mice and pierced  with the gnawings of the worms, and who were once clothed in purple and  fine linen, now lying in sackcloth and ashes, given up to oblivion,  seemed to have become habitations of the moth.  Natheless among these,  seizing the opportunity, we would sit down with more delight than a  fastidious physician among his stores of gums and spices, and there we  found the object and the stimulus of our affections.  Thus the sacred  vessels of learning came into our control and stewardship; some by  gift, others by purchase, and some lent to us for a season.    No wonder that when people saw that we were contented with gifts of  this kind, they were anxious of their own accord to minister to our  needs with those things that they were more willing to dispense with  than the things they secured by ministering to our service.  And in  good will we strove so to forward their affairs that gain accrued to  them, while justice suffered no disparagement.  Indeed, if we had loved  gold and silver goblets, high-bred horses, or no small sums of money,  we might in those days have furnished forth a rich treasury.  But in  truth we wanted manuscripts not moneyscripts; we loved codices more  than florins, and preferred slender pamphlets to pampered palfreys.    Besides all this, we were frequently made ambassador of this most  illustrious Prince of everlasting memory, and were sent on the most  various affairs of state, now to the Holy See, now to the Court of  France, and again to various powers of the world, on tedious embassies  and in times of danger, always carrying with us, however, that love of  books which many waters could not quench.  For this like a delicious  draught sweetened the bitterness of our journeyings and after the  perplexing intricacies and troublesome difficulties of causes, and the  all but inextricable labyrinths of public affairs afforded us a little  breathing space to enjoy a balmier atmosphere.    O Holy God of gods in Sion, what a mighty stream of pleasure made glad  our hearts whenever we had leisure to visit Paris, the Paradise of the  world, and to linger there; where the days seemed ever few for the  greatness of our love! There are delightful libraries, more aromatic  than stores of spicery; there are luxuriant parks of all manner of  volumes; there are Academic meads shaken by the tramp of scholars;  there are lounges of Athens; walks of the Peripatetics; peaks of  Parnassus; and porches of the Stoics.  There is seen the surveyor of  all arts and sciences Aristotle, to whom belongs all that is most  excellent in doctrine, so far as relates to this passing sublunary  world; there Ptolemy measures epicycles and eccentric apogees and the  nodes of the planets by figures and numbers; there Paul reveals the  mysteries; there his neighbour Dionysius arranges and distinguishes the  hierarchies; there the virgin Carmentis reproduces in Latin characters  all that Cadmus collected in Phoenician letters; there indeed opening  our treasuries and unfastening our purse-strings we scattered money  with joyous heart and purchased inestimable books with mud and sand.  It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer.  But in vain; for behold  how good and how pleasant it is to gather together the arms of the  clerical warfare, that we may have the means to crush the attacks of  heretics, if they arise.    Further, we are aware that we obtained most excellent opportunities of  collecting in the following way.  From our early years we attached to  our society with the most exquisite solicitude and discarding all  partiality all such masters and scholars and professors in the several  faculties as had become most distinguished by their subtlety of mind  and the fame of their learning.  Deriving consolation from their  sympathetic conversation, we were delightfully entertained, now by  demonstrative chains of reasoning, now by the recital of physical  processes and the treatises of the doctors of the Church, now by  stimulating discourses on the allegorical meanings of things, as by a  rich and well-varied intellectual feast.  Such men we chose as comrades  in our years of learning, as companions in our chamber, as associates  on our journeys, as guests at our table, and, in short, as helpmates in  all the vicissitudes of life.  But as no happiness is permitted to  endure for long, we were sometimes deprived of the bodily companionship  of some of these shining lights, when justice looking down from heaven,  the ecclesiastical preferments and dignities that they deserved fell to  their portion.  And thus it happened, as was only right, that in  attending to their own cures they were obliged to absent themselves  from attendance upon us.    We will add yet another very convenient way by which a great multitude  of books old as well as new came into our hands.  For we never regarded  with disdain or disgust the poverty of the mendicant orders, adopted  for the sake of Christ; but in all parts of the world took them into  the kindly arms of our compassion, allured them by the most friendly  familiarity into devotion to ourselves, and having so allured them  cherished them with munificent liberality of beneficence for the sake  of God, becoming benefactors of all of them in general in such wise  that we seemed none the less to have adopted certain individuals with a  special fatherly affection.  To these men we were as a refuge in every  case of need, and never refused to them the shelter of our favour,  wherefore we deserved to find them most special furtherers of our  wishes and promoters thereof in act and deed, who compassing land and  sea, traversing the circuit of the world, and ransacking the  universities and high schools of various provinces, were zealous in  combatting for our desires, in the sure and certain hope of reward.  What leveret could escape amidst so many keen-sighted hunters?  What  little fish could evade in turn their hooks and nets and snares?  From  the body of the Sacred Law down to the booklet containing the fallacies  of yesterday, nothing could escape these searchers.  Was some devout  discourse uttered at the fountain-head of Christian faith, the holy  Roman Curia, or was some strange question ventilated with novel  arguments; did the solidity of Paris, which is now more zealous in the  study of antiquity than in the subtle investigation of truth, did  English subtlety, which illumined by the lights of former times is  always sending forth fresh rays of truth, produce anything to the  advancement of science or the declaration of the faith, this was  instantly poured still fresh into our ears, ungarbled by any babbler,  unmutilated by any trifler, but passing straight from the purest of  wine-presses into the vats of our memory to be clarified.    But whenever it happened that we turned aside to the cities and places  where the mendicants we have mentioned had their convents, we did not  disdain to visit their libraries and any other repositories of books;  nay, there we found heaped up amid the utmost poverty the utmost riches  of wisdom.  We discovered in their fardels and baskets not only crumbs  falling from the masters' table for the dogs, but the shewbread without  leaven and the bread of angels having in it all that is delicious; and  indeed the garners of Joseph full of corn, and all the spoil of the  Egyptians, and the very precious gifts which Queen Sheba brought to  Solomon.    These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer, and  ingenious bees continually fabricating  cells of honey.  They are  successors of Bezaleel in devising all manner of workmanship in silver  and gold and precious stones for decorating the temple of the Church.  They are cunning embroiderers, who fashion the breastplate and ephod of  the high priest and all the various vestments of the priests.  They  fashion the curtains of linen and hair and coverings of ram's skins  dyed red with which to adorn the tabernacle of the Church militant.  They are husbandmen that sow, oxen treading out corn, sounding"]]]
