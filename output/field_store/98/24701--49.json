And that broken by such engagements and  calamities, although they had formerly been very powerful in Gaul, both  from their own valour and from the Roman people's hospitality and  friendship, they were now compelled to give the chief nobles of their  state as hostages to the Sequani, and to bind their state by an oath,  that they would neither demand hostages in return, nor supplicate aid  from the Roman people, nor refuse to be for ever under their sway and  empire. That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui who  could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as  hostages. On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the  senate at Rome to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor  hostages. But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the  vanquished Aedui, for Ariovistus, the king of the Germans, had settled  in their territories, and had seized upon a third of their land, which  was the best in the whole of Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart  from another third part, because a few months previously 24,000 men of  the Harudes had come to him, for whom room and settlements must be  provided. The consequence would be, that in a few years they would all  be driven from the territories of Gaul, and all the Germans would cross  the Rhine; for neither must the land of Gaul be compared with the land  of the Germans, nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a  level with that of the former. Moreover, [as for] Ariovistus, no sooner  did he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle, which took place at  Magetobria, than [he began] to lord it haughtily and cruelly, to demand  as hostages the children of all the principal nobles, and wreak on them  every kind of cruelty, if everything was not done at his nod or  pleasure; that he was a savage, passionate, and reckless man, and that  his commands could no longer be borne. Unless there was some aid in  Caesar and the Roman people, the Gauls must all do the same thing that  the Helvetii had done, [viz.] emigrate from their country, and seek  another dwelling place, other settlements remote from the Germans, and  try whatever fortune may fall to their lot. If these things were to be  disclosed to Ariovistus, [Divitiacus adds] that he doubts not that he  would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in  his possession, [and says] that Caesar could, either by his own  influence and by that of his army, or by his late victory, or by name of  the Roman people, intimidate him, so as to prevent a greater number of  Germans being brought over the Rhine, and could protect all Gaul from  the outrages of Ariovistus.\"    XXXII.--When this speech had been delivered by Divitiacus, all who were  present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of Caesar.  Caesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all who did none  of those things which the others did, but, with their heads bowed down,  gazed on the earth in sadness. Wondering what was the reason of this  conduct, he inquired of themselves. No reply did the Sequani make, but  silently continued in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly  inquired of them and could not elicit any answer at all, the same  Divitiacus the Aeduan answered, that--\"the lot of the Sequani was more  wretched and grievous than that of the rest, on this account, because  they alone durst not even in secret complain or supplicate aid; and  shuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus [even when] absent, just as if he  were present; for, to the rest, despite of everything, there was an  opportunity of flight given; but all tortures must be endured by the  Sequani, who had admitted Ariovistus within their territories, and whose  towns were all in his power.\"    XXXIII.--Caesar, on being informed of these things, cheered the minds of  the Gauls with his words, and promised that this affair should be an  object of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes that Ariovistus,  induced both by his kindness and his power, would put an end to his  oppression. After delivering this speech, he dismissed the assembly;  and, besides those statements, many circumstances induced him to think  that this affair ought to be considered and taken up by him; especially  as he saw that the Aedui, styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the  senate \"brethren\" and \"kinsmen,\" were held in the thraldom and dominion  of the Germans, and understood that their hostages were with Ariovistus  and the Sequani, which in so mighty an empire [as that] of the Roman  people he considered very disgraceful to himself and the republic. That,  moreover, the Germans should by degrees become accustomed to cross the  Rhine, and that a great body of them should come into Gaul, he saw  [would be] dangerous to the Roman people, and judged that wild and  savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves, after they had  possessed themselves of all Gaul, from going forth into the province and  thence marching into Italy (as the Cimbri and Teutones had done before  them), particularly as the Rhone [was the sole barrier that] separated  the Sequani from our province. Against which events he thought he ought  to provide as speedily as possible. Moreover, Ariovistus, for his part,  had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance that he was felt to be  quite insufferable.    XXXIV.--He therefore determined to send ambassadors to Ariovistus to  demand of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between  the two, [saying] that he wished to treat with him on state-business and  matters of the highest importance to both of them. To this embassy  Ariovistus replied, that if he himself had had need of anything from  Caesar, he would have gone to him; and that if Caesar wanted anything  from him he ought to come to him. That, besides, neither dare he go  without an army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of,  nor could he, without great expense and trouble, draw his army together  to one place; that to him, moreover, it appeared strange what business  either Caesar or the Roman people at all had in his own Gaul, which he  had conquered in war.    XXXV.--When these answers were reported to Caesar, he sends ambassadors  to him a second time with this message \"Since, after having been treated  with so much kindness by himself and the Roman people (as he had in his  consulship [B.C. 59] been styled 'king and friend' by the senate), he  makes this recompense to [Caesar] himself and the Roman people, [viz.]  that when invited to a conference he demurs, and does not think that it  concerns him to advise and inform himself about an object of mutual  interest, these are the things which he requires of him; first, that he  do not any more bring over any body of men across the Rhine into Gaul;  in the next place, that he restore the hostages which he has from the  Aedui, and grant the Sequani permission to restore to them with his  consent those hostages which they have, and that he neither provoke the  Aedui by outrage nor make war upon them or their allies; if he would  accordingly do this,\" [Caesar says] that \"he himself and the Roman  people will entertain a perpetual feeling of favour and friendship  towards him; but that if he [Caesar] does not obtain [his desires], that  he (forasmuch as in the consulship of Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso  [B.C. 61] the senate had decreed that, whoever should have the  administration of the province of Gaul should, as far as he could do so  consistently with the interests of the republic, protect the Aedui and  the other friends of the Roman people) will not overlook the wrongs of  the Aedui.\"    XXXVI.--To this Ariovistus replied, that \"the right of war was, that  they who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered, in  what manner they pleased; that in that way the Roman people were wont to  govern the nations which they had conquered, not according to the  dictation of any other, but according to their own discretion. If he for  his part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which  they were to exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed by the  Roman people in his right; that the Aedui, inasmuch as they had tried  the fortune of war and had engaged in arms and been conquered, had  become tributaries to him; that Caesar was doing a great injustice, in  that by his arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him;  that he should not restore their hostages to the Aedui, but should not  make war wrongfully either upon them or their allies, if they abided by  that which had been agreed on, and paid their tribute annually: if they  did _not_ continue to do that, the Roman people's name of 'brothers'  would avail them nought. As to Caesar's threatening him that be would  not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui, [he said] that no one had ever  entered into a contest with _him_ [Ariovistus] without utter ruin to  himself. That Caesar might enter the lists when he chose; he would feel  what the invincible Germans, well-trained [as they were] beyond all  others to arms, who for fourteen years had not been beneath a roof,  could achieve by their valour.\"    XXXVII.--At the same time that this message was delivered to Caesar,  ambassadors came from the Aedui and the Treviri; from the Aedui to  complain that the Harudes, who had lately been brought over into Gaul,  were ravaging their territories; that they had not been able to purchase  peace from Ariovistus, even by giving hostages: and from the Treviri,  [to state] that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10661"],[0,"A Selection from the Discourses of Epictetus with the Encheiridion (#9)"],[1,"preparation, and then consider both the nature of  your judge and your adversary. If it is necessary to embrace his knees,  embrace his knees; if to weep, weep; if to groan, groan. For when you  have subjected to externals what is your own, then be a slave and do not  resist, and do not sometimes choose to be a slave, and sometimes not  choose, but with all your mind be one or the other, either free or a  slave, either instructed or uninstructed, either a well-bred cock or a  mean one, either endure to be beaten until you die or yield at once; and  let it not happen to you to receive many stripes and then to yield. But  if these things are base, determine immediately. Where is the nature of  evil and good? It is where truth is: where truth is and where nature is,  there is caution: where truth is, there is courage where nature is.    For this reason also it is ridiculous to say, Suggest something to me  (tell me what to do). What should I suggest to you? Well, form my mind  so as to accommodate itself to any event. Why that is just the same as  if a man who is ignorant of letters should say, Tell me what to write  when any name is proposed to me. For if I should tell him to write Dion,  and then another should come and propose to him not the name of Dion but  that of Theon, what will be done? what will he write? But if you have  practised writing, you are also prepared to write (or to do) anything  that is required. If you are not, what can I now suggest? For if  circumstances require something else, what will you say, or what will  you do? Remember then this general precept and you will need no  suggestion. But if you gape after externals, you must of necessity  ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master. And who is  the master? He who has the power over the things which you seek to gain  or try to avoid.           *       *       *       *       *    HOW MAGNANIMITY IS CONSISTENT WITH CARE.--Things themselves (materials)  are indifferent; but the use of them is not indifferent. How then shall  a man preserve firmness and tranquillity, and at the same time be  careful and neither rash nor negligent? If he imitates those who play at  dice. The counters are indifferent; the dice are indifferent. How do I  know what the cast will be? But to use carefully and dexterously the  cast of the dice, this is my business. Thus then in life also the chief  business is this: distinguish and separate things, and say: Externals  are not in my power: will is in my power. Where shall I seek the good  and the bad? Within, in the things which are my own. But in what does  not belong to you call nothing either good or bad, or profit or damage  or anything of the kind.    What then? Should we use such things carelessly? In no way: for this on  the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently  against nature; but we should act carefully because the use is not  indifferent, and we should also act with firmness and freedom from  perturbations because the material is indifferent. For where the  material is not indifferent, there no man can hinder me or compel me.  Where I can be hindered and compelled, the obtaining of those things is  not in my power, nor is it good or bad; but the use is either bad or  good, and the use is in my power. But it is difficult to mingle and to  bring together these two things--the carefulness of him who is affected  by the matter (or things about him), and the firmness of him who has no  regard for it; but it is not impossible: and if it is, happiness is  impossible. But we should act as we do in the case of a voyage. What can  I do? I can choose the master of the ship, the sailors, the day, the  opportunity. Then comes a storm. What more have I to care for? for my  part is done. The business belongs to another, the master. But the ship  is sinking--what then have I to do? I do the only thing that I can, not  to be drowned full of fear, nor screaming nor blaming God, but knowing  that what has been produced must also perish: for I am not an immortal  being, but a man, a part of the whole, as an hour is a part of the day:  I must be present like the hour, and past like the hour. What difference  then does it make to me how I pass away, whether by being suffocated or  by a fever, for I must pass through some such means.    How then is it said that some external things are according to nature  and others contrary to nature? It is said as it might be said if we were  separated from union (or society): for to the foot I shall say that it  is according to nature for it to be clean; but if you take it as a foot  and as a thing not detached (independent), it will befit it both to step  into the mud and tread on thorns, and sometimes to be cut off for the  good of the whole body; otherwise it is no longer a foot. We should  think in some such way about ourselves also. What are you? A man. If you  consider yourself as detached from other men, it is according to nature  to live to old age, to be rich, to be healthy. But if you consider  yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole, it is for the sake of  that whole that at one time you should be sick, at another time take a  voyage and run into danger, and at another time be in want, and in some  cases die prematurely. Why then are you troubled? Do you not know, that  as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the body, so you  are no longer a man if you are separated from other men. For what is a  man? A part of a state, of that first which consists of gods and of men;  then of that which is called next to it, which is a small image of the  universal state. What then must I be brought to trial; must another have  a fever, another sail on the sea, another die, and another be condemned?  Yes, for it is impossible in such a universe of things, among so many  living together, that such things should not happen, some to one and  others to others. It is your duty then since you are come here, to say  what you ought, to arrange these things as it is fit. Then some one  says, \"I shall charge you with doing me wrong.\" Much good may it do you:  I have done my part; but whether you also have done yours, you must look  to that; for there is some danger of this too, that it may escape your  notice.           *       *       *       *       *    OF INDIFFERENCE.--The hypothetical proposition is indifferent: the  judgment about it is not indifferent, but it is either knowledge or  opinion or error. Thus life is indifferent: the use is not indifferent.  When any man then tells you that these things also are indifferent, do  not become negligent; and when a man invites you to be careful (about  such things), do not become abject and struck with admiration of  material things. And it is good for you to know your own preparation and  power, that in those matters where you have not been prepared, you may  keep quiet, and not be vexed, if others have the advantage over you. For  you too in syllogisms will claim to have the advantage over them; and if  others should be vexed at this, you will console them by saying, \"I have  learned them, and you have not.\" Thus also where there is need of any  practice, seek not that which is acquired from the need (of such  practice), but yield in that matter to those who have had practice, and  be yourself content with firmness of mind.    Go and salute a certain person. How? Not meanly. But I have been shut  out, for I have not learned to make my way through the window; and when  I have found the door shut, I must either come back or enter through the  window. But still speak to him. In what way? Not meanly. But suppose  that you have not got what you wanted. Was this your business, and not  his? Why then do you claim that which belongs to another? Always  remember what is your own, and what belongs to another; and you will not  be disturbed. Chrysippus therefore said well, So long as future things  are uncertain, I always cling to those which are more adapted to the  conservation of that which is according to nature; for God himself has  given me the faculty of such choice. But if I knew that it was fated (in  the order of things) for me to be sick, I would even move towards it;  for the foot also, if it had intelligence, would move to go into the  mud. For why are ears of corn produced? Is it not that they may become  dry? And do they not become dry that they may be reaped? for they are  not separated from communion with other things. If then they had  perception, ought they to wish never to be reaped? But this is a curse  upon ears of corn to be never reaped. So we must know that in the case  of men too it is a curse not to die, just the same as not to be ripened  and not to be reaped. But since we must be reaped, and we also know that  we are reaped, we are vexed at it; for we neither know what we are nor  have we studied what belongs to man, as those who have studied horses  know what belongs to horses. But Chrysantas when he was going to strike  the enemy checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat:  so it seemed better to him to obey the general's command than to follow  his own inclination. But not one of us chooses, even when necessity  summons, readily to obey it, but weeping and groaning we suffer what we  do suffer, and we call them \"circumstances.\" What kind of circumstances,  man? If you give the name of circumstances to the things which are  around you, all things are circumstances; but if you call hardships by  this name, what hardship is there in the dying of that which has been  produced? But that which destroys is either a sword, or a wheel, or the  sea, or a tile, or a tyrant. Why do you care about the way of going down  to Hades? All ways are equal. But if you will listen to the truth, the  way which the tyrant sends you is shorter. A tyrant never killed a man  in six months: but a fever is often a year about it. All these things  are only sound and the"]]]
