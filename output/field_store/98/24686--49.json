Sydney and Winifred were absorbed in their game, and the others, with the  exception of Bobby and Betty, had not noticed Tommy's brief absence.    \"Oh, look!\" Betty clutched Bobby's arm excitedly. \"What has  happened to her?\"    The woman, who had sat with her watch in her hand, snapped it shut,  prepared to make another journey to the water cooler. She half rose, an  alarmed expression flitted over her face, and she sank into her seat  again. Tommy's eyes were studiously on the checkerboard.    With one convulsive effort, the woman struggled to her feet, grasped the  bell-cord and jerked it twice, then dropped into her seat and began to  weep hysterically.    The brakes jarred down, and the train came to a sudden stop that sent  many of the passengers m a mad scramble forward.    In a few moments the conductor flung open the car door angrily. Behind  him two anxious young brakesmen peered curiously.    \"Anybody in here jerk that bellcord?\" demanded the conductor, scowling.    \"Certainly. It was I,\" said the elderly woman loftily.    \"Oh, you did, eh?\" he bristled, apparently unworried by her opinion.  \"What did you do that for? Here you've stopped a whole train.\"    \"I considered it necessary,\" was the icy reply. \"Perhaps you will be good  enough to call a doctor?\"    \"Are you ill?\" the conductor's voice changed perceptibly. \"I doubt if  there is a doctor on the train, but I'll see.\"    \"Tell him to hurry,\" said the woman commandingly. \"I think I'm  paralyzed.\"    \"Paralyzed!\" Tommy Tucker gave a loud snort and fell over backward into  the arms of his twin.    The conductor shot a suspicious glance toward him. He had traveled on  school trains before.    \"You seem to be all right, Madam,\" he said to the stricken one  courteously. \"There's a doctor at the Junction, I'm sure. What makes you  think you're paralyzed?\"    \"My good man,\" said the woman majestically, \"when a person in good health  and accustomed to normal activity suddenly loses the power to use  her--er--feet, isn't that an indication of some physical trouble?\"    Her unfortunate and un-American phrase, \"my good man,\" had nettled the  conductor, and besides his train was losing time.    \"We'll miss connections at the Junction if we fool away much more time,\"  he said testily. \"I wonder--Why look here! No wonder you can't use  your feet!\"    To the elderly woman's horror he had swooped down and laid a not  ungentle hand on her ankle in its neat and smart-looking shoe. Now he  took out his knife, slashed twice, and held up the pieces of a stout  length of twine.    \"You were tied to the seat-base by the heels of your shoes,\" he informed  the patient grimly. \"One foot tied to the other, too. Well, Jim, take in  your signals--guess we can mosey along.\"    \"And who would have expected her to wear high-heeled boots!\" exclaimed  Bobby, with real amazement showing in voice and look.    The few passengers in the car, aside from the school contingent, were  openly laughing. The victim of this practical joke turned a dull red and  the glare she turned on the back of the luckless Tommy's head was proof  enough that she knew exactly where to lay the blame.    However, she said nothing, nor did she make another trip down the aisle  and as Tommy philosophically whispered, this was worth all he had dared  and suffered. Sydney and Winifred finished their game before the Junction  was reached and that brought a wild charge to get on the train that would  carry them to Shadyside station.    To their relief, there was no sign of the elderly woman in the new car,  and as they were all a bit tired from the journey and excitement the  hour's ride to Shadyside from the Junction was comparatively quiet.    Betty looked eagerly from the window as the brakesman shouted,  \"Shadyside! Shadyside!\"          CHAPTER X    SHADYSIDE SCHOOL      \"Isn't it a pretty station!\" said Louise Littell.    Betty agreed with her.    The lawn was still green about the gray stone building and the tiles on  the low-hanging roof were moss green, too. The long platform was roofed  over and seemed swarming with girls and boys. Evidently a train had come  in from the other direction a few minutes before the Junction train, for  bags and suitcases and trunks were heaped up outside the baggage room  door and the busses backed up to the edge of the gravel driveway were  partially filled with passengers.    The blue and silver uniforms of the Salsette cadets were much in  evidence, and Betty's first thought was of how nice Bob Henderson would  look in uniform.    \"There's our friend!\" whispered Tommy Tucker, directing Betty's  attention to the severe-looking elderly woman whom he had so bothered on  the train. \"Gee, do you suppose she goes to Shadyside? I thought it was  a girls' School!\"    \"Oh, do be quiet!\" scolded Bobby Littell \"Tommy, you've got us in a peck  of trouble--she's one of the teachers!\"    \"How do you know?\" demanded Tommy. \"Who told you?\"    \"Well, if you'd keep still a minute, you'd hear,\" said the  exasperated Bobby.    Sure enough, a pleasant, fresh-faced woman, hardly more than a girl, was  escorting the gray-haired woman to a waiting touring car.    \"You're the last of the staff to come,\" she said clearly. Mrs. Eustice  was beginning to worry about you. Will you tell her that I'm coming up in  the bus with the girls?\"    \"All right, you win,\" admitted Tommy. \"Why couldn't she say she was a  teacher instead of acting so blamed exclusive? Anyway, she probably won't  connect you girls with me--all boys look alike to her.\"    \"She has a wonderful memory--like a camera,\" surmised Bobby gloomily.  \"You wait and see.\"    \"Girls, are all of you for Shadyside?\" The young woman had come up to  them and now she smiled at the giggling, chattering group with engaging  friendliness. \"I thought you were. We take this auto-stage over here.  Give your baggage checks to this porter. I'm Miss Anderson, the physical  instructor.\"    \"Salsette boys this way!\" boomed a stentorian voice.    \"Good-bye, Betty. See you soon,\" whispered Bob, giving Betty's hand a  hurried squeeze. \"We're only across the lake, you know.\"    \"You chaps, _move_!\" directed the voice snappily.    With one accord the group dissolved, the boys hastening to the stage  marked \"Salsette\" and the girls following Miss Anderson.    There were two stages for the Academy and two for Shadyside, and a  smaller bus which, they afterward learned, followed the route to the  town, which was not on the railroad.    \"Betty, darling!\"    A pretty girl tumbled down the stage steps and nearly choked Betty with  the fervency of her embrace.    It was Norma Guerin, and Alice was waiting, smiling. Betty was delighted  to meet these old friends, and she introduced them to the Littell girls  and Libbie and Frances in the happy, tangled fashion that such  introductions usually are performed. Names and faces get straightened out  more gradually.    The stage in which they found themselves, for the seven girls insisted on  sitting near each other, was well-filled. They had started and were  lurching along the rather uneven road when Betty found herself staring at  a girl on the other side of the bus.    \"Where have I seen her before?\" she puzzled. \"I wonder--does she look  like some one I know? Oh, I remember! She's the girl we saw on the  train--the one that took Bob's seat!\"    Just then a girl sitting up near the driver's seat leaned forward.    \"Ada!\" she called. \"Ada Nansen! Are you the girl they say brought five  trunks and three hat boxes?\"    \"Well, they're little ones!\" said the girl sitting opposite Betty. \"I  wanted to bring three wardrobe trunks, but mother thought Mrs. Eustice  might make a fuss.\"    So the girl's name was Ada Nansen. Betty was sure she remembered their  encounter on the train, if for no other reason than that Ada studiously  refused to meet her eye. Betty was too inexperienced to know that a  certain type of girl never takes a step toward making a new friend  unless she has the worldly standing of that friend first clearly fixed  in her mind.    \"What gorgeous furs she has!\" whispered Norma Guerin. \"Do you know  her, Betty?\"    Betty shook her head. Strictly speaking, she did not know Ada. What she  did know of her was not pleasant, and it was part of Betty's personal  creed never to repeat anything unkind if nothing good was to come of it.    \"I can tell Bob, 'cause he knows about her,\" she said to herself. \"Won't  he be surprised! I do hope she hasn't brought a huge wardrobe to school  to make Norma and Alice feel bad.\"    Though both the Guerin girls wore the neatest blouses and suits, any  girl could immediately have told you that their clothes were not new  that season and that the little bag each carried had been oiled and  polished at home.    That Ada Nansen's trunks were worrying Norma, too, her next remark  showed.    \"Alice and I have only one trunk between us,\" she confided to Betty.  \"Mother said Mrs. Eustice never allowed the girls to dress much. I made  Alice's party frock and mine, too. They're plain white.\"    \"So's mine,\" said Betty quickly. \"Mrs. Littell wouldn't let her daughters  have elaborate clothes, and the Littells have oceans of money. I don't  believe Ada can wear her fine feathers now she has 'em.\"    Twenty minutes' ride brought them in sight of the school, and as the bus  turned down the road that led to the lake, many exclamations of pleasure  were heard.    A double row of weeping willows, now bare, of course, bordered the lake,  and the sloping lawns of the school led down to these. The red brick  buildings of the Salsette Academy could be glimpsed on the other shore.  Shadyside consisted of a large brick and limestone building that the  last term pupils in the busses obligingly explained was the  \"administration,\" where classes were taught. The gymnasium was also in  this building. In addition"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10324"],[0,"Bull Hunter (#9)"],[1,"of the hotel veranda, an awful figure to behold.  His canvas coat was rolled and tied behind his sweating shoulders; his  too-short sleeves had bothered him and they were now cut off at the  elbow and exposed the sun-blackened forearms; his overalls streamed in  rags over his scarred boots. He pushed the battered hat far back on  his head and looked at the silent, attentive line of idlers who sat on  the veranda.    \"Excuse me, gents,\" he said mildly. \"But maybe one of you might know  of a little gent with iron-gray hair and a thin face and quick ways of  acting and little, thin hands.\" He illustrated his meaning by  extending his own huge paws. \"His name is Pete Reeve.\"    That name caused a sharp shifting of glances, not at Bull, but from  man to man. A tall fellow rose. He advanced with his thumbs hooked  importantly in the arm holes of his vest and braced his legs apart as  he faced Bull. The elevation of the veranda floor raised him so that  he was actually some inches above the head of his interlocutor, and  the tall man was deeply grateful for that advantage. He was, in truth,  a little vain of his own height, and to have to look up to anyone  irritated him beyond words. Having established his own superior  position, he looked the giant over from head to foot. He kept one eye  steadily on Bull, as though afraid that the big man might dodge out of  sight and elude him.    \"And what might you have to do with Pete Reeve?\" he asked. \"Mightn't  you be a partner of Pete's? Kind of looks like you was following him  sort of eager, friend.\"    While this question was being asked, Bull saw that the line of idlers  settled forward in their chairs to hear the answer. It puzzled him.  For some mysterious reason these men disapproved of any one who was  intimately acquainted with Pete Reeve, it seemed. He looked blandly  upon the tall man.    \"I never seen Pete Reeve,\" said Bull apologetically.    \"Ah? Yet you're follerin' him hotfoot?\"    \"I was aiming to see him, you know,\" answered Bull.    The tall man regarded him with eyes that began to twinkle beneath his  frown. Then he jerked his head aside and cast at his audience a  prodigious wink. The cloudy eyes of Bull had assured him that he had  to do with a simpleton, and he was inviting the others in on the game.    \"You never seen him?\" he asked gruffly, turning back to Bull. \"You  expect me to believe talk like that? Young man, d'you know who I am?\"    \"I dunno,\" murmured Bull, overawed and drawing back a pace.    The action drew a chuckle from the crowd. Some of the idlers even rose  and sauntered to the edge of the veranda, the better to see the  baiting of the giant. His prodigious size made his timidity the  more amusing.    \"You dunno, eh?\" asked the other. \"Well, son, I'm Sheriff Bill  Anderson!\" He waited to see the effect of this portentous  announcement.    \"I never heard tell of any Sheriff Bill Anderson,\" said Bull in the  same mild voice.    The sheriff gasped. The idlers hastily veiled their mouths with much  coughing and clearing of the throat. It seemed that the tables had  been subtly turned upon the sheriff.    \"You!\" exclaimed the sheriff, extending a bony arm. \"I got to tell  you, partner, that I'm a pile suspicious. I'm suspicious of anybody  that's a friend of Pete Reeve. How long have you knowed him?\"    Bull was very anxious to pacify the tall man. He shifted his weight to  the other foot. \"Something less'n nothing,\" he hastened to explain. \"I  ain't never seen him.\"    \"And why d'you want to see him? What d'you know about him?\"    It flashed through the mind of Bull that it would be useless to tell  what he knew of Pete. Obviously nobody would believe what he could  tell of how Reeve had met and shot down Uncle Bill Campbell. For Bill  Campbell was a historic figure as a fighter in the mountain regions,  and surely his face must be bright even at this distance from his  home. That he could have walked beyond the sphere of Campbell's fame  in five days never occurred to Bull Hunter.    \"I dunno nothing good,\" he confessed.    There was a change in the sheriff. He descended from the floor of the  veranda with a stiff-legged hop and took Bull by the arm, leading him  down the street.    \"Son,\" he said earnestly, walking down the street with Bull, \"d'you  know anything agin' this Pete Reeve? I want to know because I got Pete  behind the bars for murder!\"    \"Murder?\" asked Bull.    \"Murder--regular murder--something he'll hang for. And if you got any  inside information that I can use agin' him, why I'll use it and I'll  be mighty grateful for it! You see everybody knows Pete Reeve.  Everybody knows that, for all these years, he's been going around  killing and maiming men, and nobody has been able to bring him up for  anything worse'n self-defense. But now I think I got him to rights,  and I want to hang him for it, stranger, partly because it'd be a  feather in my cap, and partly because it'd be doing a favor for every  good, law-abiding citizen in these parts. So do what you can to help  me, stranger, and I'll see that your time ain't wasted.\"    There was something very wheedling and insinuating about all this  talk. It troubled Bull. His strangely obscure life had left him a  child in many important respects, and he had a child's instinctive  knowledge of the mental processes of others. In this case he felt a  profound distrust. There was something wrong about this sheriff, his  instincts told him--something gravely wrong. He disliked the man who  had started to ridicule him before many men and was now so  confidential, asking his help.    \"Sheriff Anderson,\" he said, \"may I see this Reeve?\"    \"Come right along with me, son. I ain't pressing you for what you  know. But it may be a thing that'll help me to hang Reeve. And if it  is, I'll need to know it. Understand? Public benefit--that's what I'm  after. Come along with me and you can see if Reeve's the man  you're after.\"    They crossed the street through a little maelstrom of fine dust which  a wind circle had picked up, and the sheriff led Bull into the jail.  They crossed the tawdry little outer room with its warped floor  creaking under the tread of Bull Hunter. Next they came face to face  with a cage of steel bars, and behind it was a little gray man on a  bunk. He sat up and peered at them from beneath bushy brows, a  thin-faced man, extremely agile. Even in sitting up, one caught many  possibilities of catlike speed of action.    Bull knew at once that this was the man he sought. He stood close to  the bars, grasping one in each great hand, and with his face pressed  against the steel, he peered at Pete Reeve. The other was very calm.    \"Howdy, sheriff,\" he said. \"Bringing on another one to look over your  bear?\"          CHAPTER 7      The prisoner's good humor impressed Bull immensely. Here was a man  talking commonplaces in the face of death. A greater man than Uncle  Bill, he felt at once--a far greater man. It was impossible to  conceive of that keen, sharp eye and that clawlike hand sending a  bullet far from the center of the target.    He gave his eyes long sight of that face, and then turned from the  bars and went out with the sheriff.    \"Is that your man?\" asked the sheriff.    \"I dunno,\" said Bull, fencing for time as they stood in front of the  jail. \"What'd he do?\"    \"You mean why he's in jail? I'll tell you that, son, but first I want  to know what you got agin' him--and your proofs--mostly your proofs!\"    The distaste which Bull had felt for the sheriff from the first now  became overpowering. That he should be the means of bringing that  terrible and active little man to an end seemed, as a matter of fact,  absurd. Guile must have played a part in that capture.    Suppose he were to tell the sheriff about the shooting of Uncle Bill?  That would be enough to convince men that Pete Reeve was capable of  murder, for the shooting of Uncle Bill had been worse than murder. It  spared the life and ruined it at the same time. But suppose he added  his evidence and allowed the law to take its course with Pete Reeve?  Where would be his own reward for his long march south and all the  pain of travel and the crossing of the mountains at the peril of his  life? There would be nothing but scorn from Uncle Bill when he  returned, and not that moment of praise for which he yearned. To gain  that great end he must kill Pete Reeve, but not by the aid of the law.    \"I dunno,\" he said to the sheriff who waited impatiently. \"I figure  that what I know wouldn't be no good to you.\"    The sheriff snorted. \"You been letting me waste all this time on you?\"  he asked Bull. \"Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?\"    Bull scratched his head in perplexity. But as he raised the great arm  and put his hand behind his head, the sheriff winced back a little.  \"I'm sorry,\" said Bull.    The sheriff dismissed him with a grunt of disgust, and strode off.    Bull started out to find information. This idea was growing slowly in  his mind. He must kill Pete Reeve, and to accomplish that great end he  must first free him from the jail. He went back to the hotel and went  into the kitchen to find food. The proprietor himself came back to  serve him. He was a pudgy little man with a dignified pointed beard of  which he was inordinately proud.    \"It's between times for meals,\" he declared, \"but you being the  biggest man that ever come into the hotel, I'll make an exception.\"  And he began to hunt through the cupboard for cold meat.    \"I seen Pete Reeve,\" began Bull bluntly. \"How come he's in jail?\"    \"Him?\" asked the other. \"Ain't you heard?\"    \"No.\"    The little man sighed with pleasure; he had given up hope of finding a  new listener for that oft-told tale. \"It happened last night,\" he  confided. \"Along late in the afternoon in rides Johnny Strange. He  tells us he was out to Dan Armstrong's place when, about noon, a  little gray-headed man that give the name of Pete Reeve"]]]
