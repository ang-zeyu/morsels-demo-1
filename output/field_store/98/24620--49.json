Now we shall soon  hear from him news that will give us joy or gloom: whether Erec sends  him to you here as a prisoner at your discretion, or whether he comes  in pride of heart to boast before us arrogantly that he has defeated or  killed Erec. No other news can he bring, I think.\" The Queen says: \"I am  of the same opinion.\" And all the others say: \"It may well be so.\"    (Vv. 1171-1243.) Meanwhile Yder enters the castle gate, bringing them  news. They all came down from the bower, and went to meet him. Yder came  up to the royal terrace and there dismounted from his horse. And Gawain  took the damsel and helped her down from her palfrey; the dwarf, for his  part, dismounted too. There were more than one hundred knights standing  there, and when the three newcomers had all dismounted they were led  into the King's presence. As soon as Yder saw the Queen, he bowed low  and first saluted her, then the King and his knights, and said: \"Lady,  I am sent here as your prisoner by a gentleman, a valiant and noble  knight, whose face yesterday my dwarf made smart with his knotted  scourge. He has overcome me at arms and defeated me. Lady, the dwarf I  bring you here: he has come to surrender to you at discretion. I bring  you myself, my damsel, and my dwarf to do with us as you please.\" The  Queen keeps her peace no longer, but asks him for news of Erec: \"Tell  me,\" she says, \"if you please, do you know when Erec will arrive?\"  \"To-morrow, lady, and with him a damsel he will bring, the fairest of  all I ever knew.\" When he had delivered his message, the Queen, who was  kind and sensible, said to him courteously: \"Friend, since thou hast  thrown thyself upon my mercy, thy confinement shall be less harsh; for I  have no desire to seek thy harm. But tell me now, so help thee God, what  is thy name?\" And he replies: \"Lady, my name is Yder, son of Nut.\" And  they knew that he told the truth. Then the Queen arose, and going before  the King, said: \"Sire, did you hear? You have done well to wait for  Erec, the valiant knight. I gave you good advice yesterday, when I  counselled you to await his return. This proves that it is wise to take  advice.\" The King replies: \"That is no lie; rather is it perfectly true  that he who takes advice is no fool. Happily we followed your advice  yesterday. But if you care anything for me, release this knight from his  durance, provided he consent to join henceforth my household and court;  and if he does not consent, let him suffer the consequence.\" When the  King had thus spoken, the Queen straightway released the knight; but it  was on this condition, that he should remain in the future at the court.  He did not have to be urged before he gave his consent to stay. Now he  was of the court and household to which he had not before belonged. Then  valets were at hand to run and relieve him of his arms.    (Vv. 1244-1319.) Now we must revert to Erec, whom we left in the field  where the battle had taken place. Even Tristan, when he slew fierce  Morhot on Saint Samson's isle [113], awakened no such jubilee as they  celebrated here over Erec. Great and small, thin and stout--all make  much of him and praise his knighthood. There is not a knight but cries:  \"Lord what a vassal! Under Heaven there is not his like!\" They follow  him to his lodgings, praising him and talking much. Even the Count  himself embraces him, who above the rest was glad, and said: \"Sire, if  you please, you ought by right to lodge in my house, since you are the  son of King Lac. If you would accept of my hospitality you would do me  a great honour, for I regard you as my liege. Fair sire, may it please  you, I beg you to lodge with me.\" Erec answers: \"May it not displease  you, but I shall not desert my host to-night, who has done me much  honour in giving me his daughter. What say you, sir? Is it not a fair  and precious gift?\" \"Yes, sire,\" the Count replies; \"the gift, in truth,  is fine and good. The maid herself is fair and clever, and besides is of  very noble birth. You must know that her mother is my sister. Surely, I  am glad at heart that you should deign to take my niece. Once more I beg  you to lodge with me this night.\" Erec replies: \"Ask me no more. I will  not do it.\" Then the Count saw that further insistence was useless, and  said: \"Sire, as it please you! We may as well say no more about it; but  I and my knights will all be with you to-night to cheer you and bear  you company.\" When Erec heard that, he thanked him, and returned to his  host's dwelling, with the Count attending him. Ladies and knights were  gathered there, and the vavasor was glad at heart. As soon as Erec  arrived, more than a score of squires ran quickly to remove his arms.  Any one who was present in that house could have witnessed a happy  scene. Erec went first and took his seat; then all the others in order  sit down upon the couches, the cushions, and benches. At Erec's side the  Count sat down, and the damsel with her radiant face, who was feeding  the much disputed hawk upon her wrist with a plover's wing. [114] Great  honour and joy and prestige had she gained that day, and she was very  glad at heart both for the bird and for her lord. She could not have  been happier, and showed it plainly, making no secret of her joy. All  could see how gay she was, and throughout the house there was great  rejoicing for the happiness of the maid they loved.    (Vv. 1320-1352.) Erec thus addressed the vavasor: \"Fair host, fair  friend, fair sire! You have done me great honour, and richly shall it  be repaid you. To-morrow I shall take away your daughter with me to the  King's court, where I wish to take her as my wife; and if you will  tarry here a little, I shall send betimes to fetch you. I shall have you  escorted into the country which is my father's now, but which later will  be mine. It is far from here--by no means near. There I shall give you  two towns, very splendid, rich, and fine. You shall be lord of Roadan,  which was built in the time of Adam, and of another town close by, which  is no less valuable. The people call it Montrevel, and my father owns no  better town. [115] And before the third day has passed, I shall send you  plenty of gold and silver, of dappled and grey furs, and precious silken  stuffs wherewith to adorn yourself and your wife my dear lady. To-morrow  at dawn I wish to take your daughter to court, dressed and arrayed as  she is at present. I wish my lady, the Queen, to dress her in her best  dress of satin and scarlet cloth.\"    (Vv. 1353-1478.) There was a maiden near at hand, very honourable,  prudent, and virtuous. She was seated on a bench beside the maid with  the white shift, and was her own cousin the niece of my lord the Count.  When she heard how Erec intended to take her cousin in such very poor  array to the Queen's court, she spoke about it to the Count. \"Sire,\"  she says, \"it would be a shame to you more than to any one else if this  knight should take your niece away with him in such sad array.\" And  the Count made answer: \"Gentle niece, do you give her the best of your  dresses.\" But Erec heard the conversation, and said: \"By no means, my  lord. For be assured that nothing in the world would tempt me to let  her have another robe until the Queen shall herself bestow it upon her.\"  When the damsel heard this, she replied: \"Alas! fair sire, since you  insist upon leading off my cousin thus dressed in a white shift and  chemise, and since you are determined that she shall have none of  my dresses, a different gift I wish to make her. I have three good  palfreys, as good as any of king or count, one sorrel, one dappled, and  the other black with white forefeet. Upon my word, if you had a hundred  to pick from, you would not find a better one than the dappled mount.  The birds in the air do not fly more swiftly than the palfrey; and he is  not too lively, but just suits a lady. A child can ride him, for he  is neither skittish nor balky, nor does he bite nor kick nor become  unmanageable. Any one who is looking for something better does not know  what he wants. And his pace is so easy and gentle that a body is more  comfortable and easy on his back than in a boat.\" Then said Erec: \"My  dear, I have no objection to her accepting this gift; indeed, I am  pleased with the offer, and do not wish her to refuse it.\" Then the  damsel calls one of her trusty servants, and says to him: \"Go, friend,  saddle my dappled palfrey, and lead him here at once.\" And he carries  out her command: he puts on saddle and bridle and strives to make him  appear well. Then he jumps on the maned palfrey, which is now ready for  inspection. When Erec saw the animal, he did not spare his praise, for  he could see that he was very fine and gentle. So he bade a servant lead  him back and hitch him in the stable beside his own horse. Then they all  separated, after an evening agreeably spent. The Count goes off to his  own dwelling, and leaves Erec with the vavasor, saying that he will bear  him company in the morning when he leaves. All that night they slept  well. In the morning, when the dawn was bright, Erec prepares to start,  commanding his horses to be saddled. His fair sweetheart, too, awakes,  dresses, and makes ready. The vavasor and his wife rise too, and every  knight and lady there prepares to escort the damsel and the knight. Now  they are all on horseback, and the Count as well. Erec rides beside the  Count, having beside him his sweetheart ever mindful of her hawk. Having  no other riches, she plays with her hawk. Very merry were they as they  rode along; but when the time came to part, the Count wished to send  along with Erec a party of his knights to do him honour by escorting  him. But he announced that none should bide with him, and that he wanted  no company but that of the damsel. Then, when they had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#8)"],[1," of the  forest.    After twisting and turning till the Sheriff's bewildered head sat  dizzily upon his shoulders, the greenwood men passed through a narrow  alley amid the trees which led to a goodly open space flanked by  wide-spreading oaks. Under the largest of these a pleasant fire was  crackling, and near it two fine harts lay ready for cooking. Around the  blaze were gathered another company of yeomen quite as large as that  which came with Robin Hood. Up sprang they as the latter advanced and  saluted their leader with deference, but with hearty gladness to see him  back again.    That merry wag Will Stutely was in command; and when he saw the  palefaced Sheriff being led in like any culprit, he took his cloak and  laid it humbly upon the ground and besought the Sheriff to alight upon  it, as the ground of Sherwood was unused to such dignitaries.    \"Bestir yourselves, good fellows!\" cried Robin Hood; \"and while our new  cook, whom I see with us, is preparing a feast worthy of our high guest,  let us have a few games to do him honor!\"    Then while the whole glade was filled with the savory smell of roasting  venison and fat capons, and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze,  and mulled wine sent forth a cordial fragrance, Robin Hood placed the  Sheriff upon a knoll beneath the largest oak and sat himself down by  him.    First stepped forward several pairs of men armed with the quarter-staff,  the widow's sons among them, and so skilfully did they thrust and parry  and beat down guards, that the Sheriff, who loved a good game as well as  any man, clapped his hands, forgetting where he was, and shouted, \"Well  struck! well struck! Never have I seen such blows at all the Fairs of  Nottingham!\"    Then the best archers of the band set up a small wand at eightscore  paces distant, and thereon they affixed a wreath of green. And the  archers began to shoot; and he who shot not through the garland without  disturbing its leaves and tendrils was fain to submit to a good sound  buffet from Little John. But right cunning was the shooting, for the  men had spent a certain time in daily practice, and many were the shafts  which sped daintily through the circle. Nathless now and again some  luckless fellow would shoot awry and would be sent winding from a long  arm blow from the tall lieutenant while the glade roared with laughter.  And none more hearty a guffaw was given than came from the Sheriff's own  throat, for the spirit of the greenwood was upon him.    But presently his high mood was dashed. The company sat down to meat,  and the guest was treated to two more disturbing surprise. The cook came  forward to serve the food, when the Sheriff beheld in him his own former  servant, and one whom he supposed was at the moment in the scullery at  Nottingham.    Much the miller's son grinned by way of answer to the Sheriff's  amazement, and served the plates, and placed them before the party. Then  did the Sheriff gasp and fairly choke with rage. The service was his own  silverware from the Mansion House!    \"You rascals! you rogues!\" he spluttered. \"Was it not enough to defraud  me out of three of my servants, that you must also rob me of my best  silver service? Nay, by my life, but I will not touch your food!\"    But Robin Hood bade him pause.    \"Gramercy!\" quoth he, \"servants come and go, in merry England, and so  does service. The platters are but used to do your worship honor. And as  for your life, it is forfeit to your eagerness to buy my herd of cattle  so cheaply. Now sit you down again and make good cheer, Sheriff, for  charity! And for the love of Little John your life is granted you!\"    So the Sheriff sat him down again, with the best face he could assume,  and soon the cook's viands were disappearing down his gullet as rapidly  as the next man's. And they feasted royally and clinked each other's  cups until the sun had ceased to print the pattern of the leaves upon  the forest carpet.    Then the Sheriff arose and said: \"I thank you, Robin Hood, one-time  butcher, and you, Little John, one-time beggar, and you, Much, one-time  cook, and all you good men who have entertained me in Sherwood so well.  Promises I make not as to how I shall requite you when next you come to  Nottingham, for I am in the King's service. So for the present the score  rests with you. But the shadows grow long and I must away, if you will  be pleased to pilot me to the road.\"    Then Robin Hood and all his men arose and drank the Sheriff's health,  and Robin said: \"If you must needs go at once we will not detain  you--except that you have forgotten two things.\"    \"What may they be?\" asked the Sheriff, while his heart sank within him.    \"You forget that you came with me to-day to buy a herd of horned beasts;  likewise that he who dines at the Greenwood Inn must pay the landlord.\"    The Sheriff fidgeted like a small boy who has forgotten his lesson.    \"Nay, I have but a small sum with me,\" he began apologetically.    \"What is that sum, gossip?\" questioned Little John, \"for my own wage  should also come out of it!\"    \"And mine!\" said Much.    \"And mine!\" smiled Robin.    The Sheriff caught his breath. \"By my troth, are all these silver dishes  worth anything?\"    The outlaws roared heartily at this.    \"I'll tell you what it is, worship,\" said Robin, \"we three rascally  servants will compound our back wages for those plates. And we will keep  the herd of cattle free for our own use--and the King's. But this little  tavern bill should be settled! Now, what sum have you about you?\"    \"I have only those twenty pieces of gold, and twenty others,\" said the  Sheriff: and well it was that he told the truth for once, for Robin  said:    \"Count it, Little John.\"    Little John turned the Sheriff's wallet inside out. \"'Tis true enough,\"  he said.    \"Then you shall pay no more than twenty pieces for your entertainment,  excellence,\" decreed Robin. \"Speak I soothly, men of greenwood?\"    \"Good!\" echoed the others.    \"The Sheriff should swear by his patron saint that he will not molest  us,\" said Will Stutely; and his addition was carried unanimously.    \"So be it, then,\" cried Little John, approaching the sheriff. \"Now swear  by your life and your patron saint--\"    \"I will swear it by St. George, who is patron of us all,\" said the  Sheriff vigorously, \"that I will never disturb or distress the outlaws  in Sherwood.\"    \"But let me catch any of you _out_ of Sherwood!\" thought he to himself.    Then the twenty pieces of gold were paid over, and the Sheriff once more  prepared to depart.    \"Never had we so worshipful a guest before,\" said Robin; \"and as the new  moon is beginning to silver the leaves, I shall bear you company myself  for part of the way. 'Twas I who brought you into the wood.\"    \"Nay, I protest against your going needlessly far,\" said Sheriff.    \"But I protest that I am loath to lose your company,\" replied Robin.  \"The next time I may not be so pleased.\"    And he took the Sheriff's horse by the bridle rein, and led him through  the lane and by many a thicket till the main road was reached.    \"Now fare you well, good Sheriff,\" he said, \"and when next you think to  despoil a poor prodigal, remember the herd you would have bought over  against Gamewell. And when next you employ a servant, make certain that  he is not employing you.\"    So saying he smote the nag's haunch, and off went the Sheriff upon the  road to Nottingham.    And that is how--you will find from many ballads that came to be sung  at the Sheriff's expense, and which are known even to the present  day--that, I say, is how the Sheriff lost three good servants and found  them again.          CHAPTER VI    HOW ROBIN HOOD MET WILL SCARLET         The youngster was clothed in scarlet red       In scarlet fine and gay;       And he did frisk it o'er the plain,       And chanted a roundelay.    One fine morning, soon after the proud Sheriff had been brought to  grief, Robin Hood and Little John went strolling down a path through the  wood. It was not far from the foot--bridge where they had fought their  memorable battle; and by common impulse they directed their steps to  the brook to quench their thirst and rest them in the cool bushes. The  morning gave promise of a hot day. The road even by the brook was dusty.  So the cooling stream was very pleasing and grateful to their senses.    On each side of them, beyond the dusty highway, stretched out broad  fields of tender young corn. On the yon side of the fields uprose the  sturdy oaks and beeches and ashes of the forest; while at their feet  modest violets peeped out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor  which made the heart glad. Over on the far side of the brook in a tiny  bay floated three lily-pads; and from amid some clover blossoms on the  bank an industrious bee rose with the hum of busy contentment. It was a  day so brimful of quiet joy that the two friends lay flat on their  backs gazing up at the scurrying clouds, and neither caring to break the  silence.    Presently they heard some one coming up the road whistling gaily, as  though he owned the whole world and 'twas but made to whistle in. Anon  he chanted a roundelay with a merry note.    \"By my troth, a gay bird!\" quoth Robin, raising up on his elbow. \"Let us  lie still, and trust that his purse is not as light as his heart.\"    So they lay still, and in a minute more up came a smart stranger dressed  in scarlet and silk and wearing a jaunty hat with a curling cock feather  in it. His whole costume was of scarlet, from the feather to the silk  hosen on his legs. A goodly sword hung at his side, its scabbard all  embossed with tilting knights and weeping ladies. His hair was long and  yellow and hung clustering about his shoulders, for all the world like a  schoolgirl's; and he bore himself with as mincing a gait as the pertest  of them.    Little John clucked his teeth drolly at this sight. \"By my troth, a gay  bird!\" he said"]]]
