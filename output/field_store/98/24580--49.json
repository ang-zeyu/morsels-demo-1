While it exists, consciousness--differing therein  from jars and the like--is never observed not to shine forth, and it  cannot therefore be held to depend, in its shining forth, on something  else.--You (who object to the above reasoning) perhaps hold the  following view:--even when consciousness has arisen, it is the object  only which shines forth--a fact expressed in sentences such as: the jar  is perceived. When a person forms the judgment 'This is a jar,' he is  not at the time conscious of a consciousness which is not an object and  is not of a definite character. Hence the existence of consciousness is  the reason which brings about the 'shining forth' of jars and other  objects, and thus has a similar office as the approximation of the  object to the eye or the other organs of sense (which is another  condition of perceptive consciousness). After this the existence of  consciousness is inferred on the ground that the shining forth of the  object is (not permanent, but) occasional only [FOOTNOTE 34:1]. And  should this argumentation be objected to on the ground of its implying  that consciousness--which is essentially of the nature of intelligence--  is something non-intelligent like material things, we ask you to define  this negation of non-intelligence (which you declare to be  characteristic of consciousness). Have we, perhaps, to understand by it  the invariable concomitance of existence and shining forth? If so, we  point out that this invariable concomitance is also found in the case of  pleasure and similar affections; for when pleasure and so on exist at  all, they never are non-perceived (i.e. they exist in so far only as we  are conscious of them). It is thus clear that we have no consciousness  of consciousness itself--just as the tip of a finger, although touching  other things, is incapable of touching itself.    All this reasoning, we reply, is entirely spun out of your own fancy,  without any due consideration of the power of consciousness. The fact is,  that in perceiving colour and other qualities of things, we are not  aware of a 'shining forth' as an attribute of those things, and as  something different from consciousness; nor can the assumption of an  attribute of things called 'light,' or 'shining forth,' be proved in any  way, since the entire empirical world itself can be proved only through  consciousness, the existence of which we both admit. Consciousness,  therefore, is not something which is inferred or proved through some  other act of knowledge; but while proving everything else it is proved  by itself. This may be expressed in technical form as follows--  Consciousness is, with regard to its attributes and to the empirical  judgments concerning it, independent of any other thing, because through  its connexion with other things it is the cause of their attributes and  the empirical judgments concerning them. For it is a general principle  that of two things that which through its connexion with the other is  the cause of the attributes of--and the empirical judgments about--the  latter, is itself independent of that other as to those two points. We  see e.g. that colour, through its conjunction with earth and the like,  produces in them the quality of visibility, but does not itself depend  for its visibility on conjunction with colour. Hence consciousness is  itself the cause of its own 'shining forth,' as well as of the  empirically observed shining forth of objects such as jars and the like.    Consciousness is eternal and incapable of change.    This self-luminous consciousness, further, is eternal, for it is not  capable of any form of non-existence--whether so--called antecedent  non-existence or any other form. This follows from its being  self-established. For the antecedent non-existence of self-established  consciousness cannot be apprehended either through consciousness or  anything else. If consciousness itself gave rise to the apprehension of  its own non-existence, it could not do so in so far as 'being,' for that  would contradict its being; if it is, i.e. if its non-existence is not,  how can it give rise to the idea of its non-existence? Nor can it do so  if not being; for if consciousness itself is not, how can it furnish a  proof for its own non-existence? Nor can the non-existence of  consciousness be apprehended through anything else; for consciousness  cannot be the object of anything else. Any instrument of knowledge  proving the non-existence of consciousness, could do so only by making  consciousness its object--'this is consciousness'; but consciousness, as  being self-established, does not admit of that objectivation which is  implied in the word 'this,' and hence its previous non-existence cannot  be proved by anything lying outside itself.    As consciousness thus does not admit of antecedent non-existence, it  further cannot be held to originate, and hence also all those other  states of being which depend on origination cannot be predicated of it.    As consciousness is beginningless, it further does not admit of any  plurality within itself; for we observe in this case the presence of  something which is contrary to what invariably accompanies plurality  (this something being 'beginninglessness' which is contrary to the  quality of having a beginning--which quality invariably accompanies  plurality). For we never observe a thing characterised by plurality to  be without a beginning.--And moreover difference, origination, &c., are  objects of consciousness, like colour and other qualities, and hence  cannot be attributes of consciousness. Therefore, consciousness being  essentially consciousness only, nothing else that is an object of  consciousness can be its attribute. The conclusion is that consciousness  is free from difference of any kind.    The apparent difference between Consciousness and the conscious subject  is due to the unreal ahamkâra.    From this it further follows that there is no substrate of  consciousness--different from consciousness itself--such as people  ordinarily mean when speaking of a 'knower.' It is self-luminous  consciousness itself which constitutes the so-called 'knower.' This  follows therefrom also that consciousness is not non-intelligent (jada);  for non-intelligence invariably accompanies absence of Selfhood  (anâtmatva); hence, non-intelligence being absent in consciousness,  consciousness is not non-Self, that means, it is the Self.    But, our adversary again objects, the consciousness which expresses  itself in the judgment 'I know,' proves that the quality of being a  'knower' belongs to consciousness!--By no means, we reply. The  attribution to consciousness of this quality rests on error, no less  than the attribution, to the shell, of the quality of being silver.  Consciousness cannot stand in the relation of an agent toward itself:  the attribute of being a knowing agent is erroneously imputed to it--an  error analogous to that expressed in the judgment 'I am a man,' which  identifies the Self of a person with the outward aggregate of matter  that bears the external characteristics of humanity. To be a 'knower'  means to be the agent in the action of knowing; and this is something  essentially changeful and non-intelligent (jada), having its abode in  the ahamkâra, which is itself a thing subject to change. How, on the  other hand, could such agency possibly belong to the changeless  'witness' (of all change, i.e. consciousness) whose nature is pure Being?  That agency cannot be an attribute of the Self follows therefrom also  that, like colour and other qualities, agency depends, for its own proof,  on seeing, i.e. consciousness.    That the Self does not fall within the sphere (is not an object of), the  idea of 'I' is proved thereby also that in deep sleep, swoon, and  similar states, the idea of the 'I' is absent, while the consciousness  of the Self persists. Moreover, if the Self were admitted to be an agent  and an object of the idea of 'I,' it would be difficult to avoid the  conclusion that like the body it is non-intelligent, something merely  outward ('being for others only, not for itself') and destitute of  Selfhood. That from the body, which is the object of the idea of 'I,'  and known to be an agent, there is different that Self which enjoys the  results of the body's actions, viz. the heavenly word, and so on, is  acknowledged by all who admit the validity of the instruments of  knowledge; analogously, therefore, we must admit that different from the  knower whom we understand by the term 'I,' is the 'witnessing' inward  Self. The non-intelligent ahamkâra thus merely serves to manifest the  nature of non-changing consciousness, and it effects this by being its  abode; for it is the proper quality of manifesting agents to manifest  the objects manifested, in so far as the latter abide in them. A mirror,  e.g., or a sheet of water, or a certain mass of matter, manifests a face  or the disc of the moon (reflected in the mirror or water) or the  generic character of a cow (impressed on the mass of matter) in so far  as all those things abide in them.--In this way, then, there arises the  erroneous view that finds expression in the judgment 'I know.'--Nor must  you, in the way of objection, raise the question how self-luminous  consciousness is to be manifested by the non-intelligent ahamkâra, which  rather is itself manifested by consciousness; for we observe that the  surface of the hand, which itself is manifested by the rays of sunlight  falling on it, at the same time manifests those rays. This is clearly  seen in the case of rays passing through the interstices of network; the  light of those rays is intensified by the hand on which they fall, and  which at the same time is itself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],[0,"William Tell Told Again (#8)"],[1,"of the sailors overhead, as  they ran about the deck, and gave up all hope of ever seeing his home  and his friends again.    But soon he began to notice that the ship was rolling and pitching more  than it had been doing at first, and it was not long before he realized  that a very violent storm had begun. Storms sprung up very suddenly on  the lake, and made it unsafe for boats that attempted to cross it.  Often the sea was quite unruffled at the beginning of the crossing, and  was rough enough at the end to wreck the largest ship.    Tell welcomed the storm. He had no wish to live if life meant years of  imprisonment in a dark dungeon of Castle Kuessnacht. Drowning would be a  pleasant fate compared with that. He lay at the bottom of the ship,  hoping that the next wave would dash them on to a rock and send them to  the bottom of the lake. The tossing became worse and worse.    Upon the deck Gessler was standing beside the helmsman, and gazing  anxiously across the waters at the rocks that fringed the narrow  entrance to the bay a few hundred yards to the east of Castle  Kuessnacht. This bay was the only spot for miles along the shore at  which it was possible to land safely. For miles on either side the  coast was studded with great rocks, which would have dashed a ship to  pieces in a moment. It was to this bay that Gessler wished to direct  the ship. But the helmsman told him that he could not make sure of  finding the entrance, so great was the cloud of spray which covered it.  A mistake would mean shipwreck.    \"My lord,\" said the helmsman, \"I have  neither strength nor skill to guide the helm. I do not know which way  to turn.\"    \"What are we to do?\" asked Rudolph der Harras, who was standing near.    The helmsman hesitated. Then he spoke, eyeing the Governor uneasily.    \"Tell could steer us through,\" he said, \"if your lordship would but  give him the helm.\"    Gessler started.    \"Tell!\" he muttered. \"Tell!\"    The ship drew nearer to the rocks.    \"Bring him here,\" said Gessler.    Two soldiers went down to the hold and released Tell. They bade him get  up and come with them. Tell followed them on deck, and stood before the  Governor.    \"Tell,\" said Gessler.    Tell looked at him without speaking.    \"Take the helm, Tell,\" said Gessler, \"and steer the ship through those  rocks into the bay beyond, or instant death shall be your lot.\"    Without a word Tell took the helmsman's place, peering keenly into the  cloud of foam before him. To right and to left he turned the vessel's  head, and to right again, into the very heart of the spray. They were  right among the rocks now, but the ship did not strike on them.  Quivering and pitching, she was hurried along, until of a sudden the  spray-cloud was behind her, and in front the calm waters of the bay.    Gessler beckoned to the helmsman.    \"Take the helm again,\" he said.    He pointed to Tell.    \"Bind him,\" he said to the soldiers.    The soldiers advanced slowly, for they were loath to bind the man who  had just saved them from destruction. But the Governor's orders must he  obeyed, so they came towards Tell, carrying ropes with which to bind  him.    Tell moved a step back. The ship was gliding past a lofty rock. It was  such a rock as Tell had often climbed when hunting the chamois. He  acted with the quickness of the hunter. Snatching up the bow and quiver  which lay on the deck, he sprang on to the bulwark of the vessel, and,  with a mighty leap, gained the rock. Another instant, and he was out of  reach.    Gessler roared to his bowmen.    \"Shoot! shoot!\" he cried.    The bowmen hastily fitted arrow to string. They were too late. Tell was  ready before them. There was a hiss as the shaft rushed through the  air, and the next moment Gessler the Governor fell dead on the deck,  pierced through the heart.    Tell's second arrow had found its mark, as his first had done.    [Illustration: PLATE XV]          CHAPTER XV      There is not much more of the story of William Tell. The death of  Gessler was a signal to the Swiss to rise in revolt, and soon the whole  country was up in arms against the Austrians. It had been chiefly the  fear of the Governor that had prevented a rising before. It had been  brewing for a long time. The people had been bound by a solemn oath to  drive the enemy out of the country. All through Switzerland  preparations for a revolution were going on, and nobles and peasants  had united.    Directly the news arrived that the Governor was slain, meetings of the  people were held in every town in Switzerland, and it was resolved to  begin the revolution without delay. All the fortresses that Gessler had  built during his years of rule were carried by assault on the same  night. The last to fall was one which had only been begun a short time  back, and the people who had been forced to help to build it spent a  very pleasant hour pulling down the stones which had cost them such  labour to put in their place. Even the children helped. It was a great  treat to them to break what they pleased without being told not to.    \"See,\" said Tell, as he watched them, \"in years to come, when these  same children are gray-haired, they will remember this night as freshly  as they will remember it to-morrow.\"    A number of people rushed up, bearing the pole which Gessler's soldiers  had set up in the meadow. The hat was still on top of it, nailed to the  wood by Tell's arrow.    \"Here's the hat!\" shouted Ruodi--\"the hat to which we were to bow!\"    \"What shall we do with it?\" cried several voices.    \"Destroy it! Burn it!\" said others. \"To the flames with this emblem of  tyranny!\"    But Tell stopped them.    \"Let us preserve it,\" he said. \"Gessler set it up to be a means  of enslaving the country; we will set it up as a memorial of our  newly-gained liberty. Nobly is fulfilled the oath we swore to drive  the tyrants from our land. Let the pole mark the spot where the  revolution finished.\"    \"But _is_ it finished?\" said Arnold of Melchthal. \"It is a nice  point. When the Emperor of Austria hears that we have killed his friend  Gessler, and burnt down all his fine new fortresses, will he not come  here to seek revenge?\"    \"He will,\" said Tell. \"And let him come. And let him bring all his  mighty armies. We have driven out the enemy that was in our land. We  will meet and drive away the enemy that comes from another country.  Switzerland is not easy to attack. There are but a few mountain passes  by which the foe can approach. We will stop these with our bodies. And  one great strength we have: we are united. And united we need fear no  foe.\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted everybody.    \"But who is this that approaches?\" said Tell. \"He seems excited.  Perhaps he brings news.\"    It was Roesselmann the pastor, and he brought stirring news.    \"These are strange times in which we live,\" said Roesselmann, coming up.    \"Why, what has happened?\" cried everybody.    \"Listen, and be amazed.\"    \"Why, what's the matter?\"    \"The Emperor----\"    \"Yes?\"    \"The Emperor is dead.\"    \"What! dead?\"    \"Dead!\"    \"Impossible! How came you by the news?\"    \"John Mueller of Schaffhausen brought it. And he is a truthful man.\"    \"But how did it happen?\"    \"As the Emperor rode from Stein to Baden the lords of Eschenbach and  Tegerfelden, jealous, it is said, of his power, fell upon him with  their spears. His bodyguard were on the other side of a stream--the  Emperor had just crossed it--and could not come to his assistance. He  died instantly.\"    By the death of the Emperor the revolution in Switzerland was enabled  to proceed without check. The successor of the Emperor had too much to  do in defending himself against the slayers of his father to think of  attacking the Swiss, and by the time he was at leisure they were too  strong to be attacked. So the Swiss became free.    As for William Tell, he retired to his home, and lived there very  happily ever afterwards with his wife and his two sons, who in a few  years became very nearly as skilful in the use of the cross-bow as  their father.          EPILOGUE.           Some say the tale related here         Is amplified and twisted;       Some say it isn't very clear         That William Tell existed;       Some say he freed his country _so_,         The Governor demolished.       Perhaps he did. I only know         That taxes aren't abolished!                   *       *       *       *       *      [The Illustrations and accompanying descriptive verses]          [PROLOGUE.]         The Swiss, against their Austrian foes,         Had ne'er a soul to lead 'em,       Till Tell, as you've heard tell, arose         And guided them to freedom.       Tell's tale we tell again--an act         For which pray no one scold us--       This tale of Tell we tell, in fact,         As this Tell tale was told us.          PLATE I.           Beneath a tyrant foreign yoke,         How love of freedom waxes!       (Especially when foreign folk         Come round collecting taxes.)       The Swiss, held down by Gessler's fist,         Would fain have used evasion;       Yet none there seemed who could resist         His methods of persuasion.

And pride so filled this Gessler's soul         (A monarch's pride outclassing),       He stuck his hat up on a pole,         That all might bow in passing.       Then rose the patriot, William Tell--         \"We've groaned 'neath Austria's sway first;       Must we be ruled by poles as well?
