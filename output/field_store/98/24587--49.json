He was out on foot  with his flock, when the dogs discovered the animal concealed among the  bushes. He had left his gun at home, and having no weapon, and finding  that the dogs dared not attack it where it sat in a defiant attitude  with its back against a thorny bush, he looked about and found a large  dry stick, and going boldly up to it tried to stun it with a violent  blow on the head. But though it never looked at him, its fiery eyes  gazing steadily at the dogs all the time, he could not hit it, for with  a quick side movement it avoided every blow. The small heed the puma  paid him, and the apparent ease with which it avoided his best-aimed  blows, only served to rouse his spirit, and at length striking with  increased force his stick came to the ground and was broken to pieces.  For some moments he now stood within two yards of the animal perfectly  defenceless and not knowing what to do. Suddenly it sprang past him,  actually brushing against his arm with its side, and began pursuing the  dogs round and round among the bushes. In the end my informant's partner  appeared on the scene with his rifle, and the puma was shot.    In encounters of this kind the most curious thing is that the puma  steadfastly refuses to recognize an enemy in man, although it finds him  acting in concert with its hated canine foe, about whose hostile  intentions it has no such delusion.    Several years ago a paragraph, which reached me in South America,  appeared in the English papers relating an incident characteristic of  the puma in a wild beast show in this country. The animal was taken out  of its cage and led about the grounds by its keeper, followed by a large  number of spectators. Suddenly it was struck motionless by some object  in the crowd, at which it gazed steadily with a look of intense  excitement; then springing violently away it dragged the chain from the  keeper's hand and dashed in among the people, who immediately fled  screaming in all directions. Their fears were, however, idle, the object  of the puma's rage being a dog which it had spied among the crowd.    It is said that when taken adult pumas invariably pine away and die;  when brought up in captivity they invariably make playful, affectionate  pets, and are gentle towards all human beings, but very seldom overcome  their instinctive animosity towards the dog.    One of the very few authentic instances I have met with of this animal  defending itself against a human being was related to me at a place on  the pampas called Saladillo. At the time of my visit there jaguars and  pumas were very abundant and extremely destructive to the cattle and  horses. Sheep it had not yet been considered worth while to introduce,  but immense herds of pigs were kept at every estancia, these animals  being able to protect themselves. One gaucho had so repeatedly  distinguished himself by his boldness and dexterity in killing jaguars  that he was by general consent made the leader of every tiger-hunt. One  day the comandante of the district got twelve or fourteen men together,  the tiger-slayer among them, and started in search of a jaguar which had  been seen that morning in the neighbourhood of his estancia. The animal  was eventually found and surrounded, and as it was crouching among some  clumps of tall pampas grass, where throwing a lasso over its neck would  be a somewhat difficult and dangerous operation, all gave way to the  famous hunter, who at once uncoiled his lasso and proceeded in a  leisurely manner to form the loop. While thus engaged he made the  mistake of allowing his horse, which had grown restive, to turn aside  from the hunted animal. The jaguar, instantly taking advantage of the  oversight, burst from its cover and sprang first on to the haunches of  the horse, then seizing the hunter by his poncho dragged him to the  earth, and would no doubt have quickly despatched him if a lasso, thrown  by one of the other men, had not closed round its neck at this critical  moment. It was quickly dragged off, and eventually killed. But the  discomfited hunter did not stay to assist at the finish. He arose from  the ground unharmed, but in a violent passion and blaspheming horribly,  for he knew that his reputation, which he priced above everything, had  suffered a great blow, and that he would be mercilessly ridiculed by his  associates. Getting on his horse he rode away by himself from the scene  of his misadventure. Of what happened to him on his homeward ride there  were no witnesses; but his own account was as follows, and inasmuch as  it told against his own prowess it was readily believed: Before riding a  league, and while his bosom was still burning with rage, a puma started  up from the long grass in his path, but made no attempt to run away; it  merely sat up, he said, and looked at him in a provokingly fearless  manner. To slay this animal with his knife, and so revenge himself on it  for the defeat he had just suffered, was his first thought. He alighted  and secured his horse by tying its fore feet together, then, drawing his  long, heavy knife, rushed at the puma. Still it did not stir. Raising  his weapon he struck with a force which would have split the animal's  skull open if the blow had fallen where it was intended to fall, but  with a quick movement the puma avoided it, and at the same time lifted a  foot and with lightning rapidity dealt the aggressor a blow on the face,  its unsheathed claws literally dragging down the flesh from his cheek,  laying the bone bare. After inflicting this terrible punishment and  eyeing its fallen foe for a few seconds it trotted quietly away. The  wounded man succeeded in getting on to his horse and reaching his home.  The hanging flesh was restored to its place and the ghastly rents sewn  up, and in the end he recovered: but he was disfigured for life; his  temper also completely changed; he became morose and morbidly sensitive  to the ridicule of his neighbours, and he never again ventured to join  them in their hunting expeditions. I inquired of the comandante, and of  others, whether any case had come to their knowledge in that district in  which the puma had shown anything beyond a mere passive friendliness  towards man; in reply they related the following incident, which had  occurred at the Saladillo a few years before my visit: The men all went  out one day beyond the frontier to form a _cerco,_ as it is called, to  hunt ostriches and other game. The hunters, numbering about thirty,  spread themselves round in a vast ring and, advancing towards the  centre, drove the animals before them. During the excitement of the  chase which followed, while they were all engaged in preventing the  ostriches, deer, &c., from doubling back and escaping, it was not  noticed that one of the hunters had disappeared; his horse, however,  returned to its home during the evening, and on the next morning a fresh  hunt for the lost man was organized. He was eventually found lying on  the ground with a broken leg, where he had been thrown at the beginning  of the hunt. He related that about an hour after it had become dark a  puma appeared and sat near him, but did not seem to notice him. After a  while it became restless, frequently going away and returning, and  finally it kept away so long, that he thought it had left him for good.  About midnight he heard the deep roar of a jaguar, and gave himself up  for lost. By raising himself on his elbow he was able to see the outline  of the beast crouching near him, but its face was turned from him, and  it appeared to be intently watching some object on which it was about to  spring. Presently it crept out of sight, then he heard snarlings and  growlings and the sharp yell of a puma, and he knew that the two beasts  were fighting. Before morning he saw the jaguar several times, but the  puma renewed the contest with it again and again until morning appeared,  after which he saw and heard no more of them.    Extraordinary as this story sounds, it did not seem so to me when I  heard it, for I had already met with many anecdotes of a similar nature  in various parts of the country, some of them vastly more interesting  than the one I have just narrated; only I did not get them at first  hand, and am consequently not able to vouch for their accuracy; but in  this case it seemed to me that there was really no room for doubt. All  that I had previously heard had compelled me to believe that the puma  really does possess a unique instinct of friendliness for man, the  origin of which, like that of many other well-known instincts of  animals, must remain a mystery. The fact that the puma never makes an  unprovoked attack on a human being, or eats human flesh, and that it  refuses, except in some very rare cases, even to defend itself, does not  seem really less wonderful in an animal of its bold and sanguinary  temper thau that it should follow the traveller in the wilderness, or  come near him when he lies sleeping or disabled, and even occasionally  defend him from its enemy the jaguar. We know that certain sounds,  colours, or smells, which are not particularly noticed by most animals,  produce an extraordinary effect on some species; and it is possible to  believe, I think, that the human form or countenance, or the odour of  the human body, may also have the effect on the puma of suspending its  predatory instincts and inspiring it with a gentleness towards man,  which we are only accustomed to see in our domesticated carnivores or in  feral animals towards those of their own species. Wolves, when pressed  with hunger, will sometimes devour a fellow wolf; as a rule, however,  rapacious animals will starve to death rather than prey on one of their  own kind, nor is it a common thing for them to attack"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7450"],[0,"Terre Napoleón; a History of French Explorations and Projects in Australia (#8)"],[1,"did Flinders name  an island after him, and another after a midshipman, Taylor, who perished  on the same occasion, but he gave to each of the islands near Cape  Catastrophe the name of one of the seamen who lost their lives in the  accident. In a country where men are valued for their native worth rather  than on account of rank or wealth, such as is happily the case to a very  large degree in Australia--and this is a far finer thing than mere  political democracy--perhaps nothing in the career of Flinders is more  likely to ensure respect for his memory, apart from the value of his  achievements, than this perpetuation of the names of the sailors who died  in the service.    Throughout the voyage he promoted amusements among his people; \"and when  the evenings were fine the drum and fife announced the forecastle to be  the scene of dancing; nor did I discourage other playful amusements which  might occasionally be more to the taste of the sailors, and were not  unseasonable.\"* (* Voyage 1 36.) The work may have been strenuous, and  the commander was unsparing of his own energies; but the life was happy,  and above all it was healthy. The pride which Flinders had in the result  was modestly expressed: \"I had the satisfaction to see my people orderly  and full of zeal for the service in which we were engaged.\" Really, it  was a splendid achievement in itself, and it showed that, if the hardship  of life in a small ship, on a long voyage, could not be abolished, at  least horror could be banished from it.    Compare this genial record with that of the French exploring ships Le  Geographe and Le Naturaliste, which were quite as well equipped for a  long voyage. They had, it is true, been longer at sea, but they had an  advantage not open to Flinders in being able to refit at Mauritius, had  rested again for some weeks at Timor, and had spent a considerable time  in the salubrious climate of southern Tasmania, where there was an  abundance of fresh food and water. When, on June 23, 1802, Le Geographe  appeared off Port Jackson, to solicit help from Governor King, it was  indeed \"a ghastly crew\" that she had on board. Her officers and crew were  rotten with scurvy. Scarcely one of them was fit to haul a rope or go  aloft. Out of one hundred and seventy men, only twelve were capable of  any kind of duty, and only two helmsmen could take their turn at the  wheel. Not a soul aboard, of any rank, was free from the disease.* (*  Peron, Voyage de Decouvertes 1 331 to 340; Flinders, Voyage 1 230.) Of  twenty-three scientific men and artists who sailed from Havre, in 1800,  only three returned to France with the expedition, and before its work  was over the Commander, Baudin, and several of the staff were dead. The  chief naturalist, Francois Peron, and one of the surgeons, Taillefer,  have left terrible accounts of the sufferings endured. Putrid water,  biscuits reduced almost to dust by weevils, and salt meat so absolutely  offensive to sight and smell that \"the most famished of the crew  frequently preferred to suffer the agonies of hunger\" rather than eat  it--these conditions, together with neglect of routine sanitary  precautions, produced a pitiable state of debility and pain, that made  the ship like an ancient city afflicted with plague. Indeed, the vivid  narratives of Thucydides and Boccaccio, when they counted:       \"the sad degrees  Upon the plague's dim dial, caught the tone  Of a great death that lay upon the land,\"    are not more haggard in their naturalism than is Taillefer's picture of  the sufferings of the sailors to whom he ministered. Their skin became  covered with tumours, which left ugly black patches; where hair grew  appeared sores \"the colour of wine lees\"; their lips shrivelled,  revealing gums mortified and ulcerated. They exhaled a breath so fetid in  odour that Taillefer loathed having to administer to them such remedies  as he had to give; and at one part of the voyage even his stock of drugs  was depleted, so great was the demand upon his resources. Their joints  became stiff, their muscles flaccid and contracted, and the utter  prostration to which they were reduced made him regret that they retained  so much of their intellectual faculties as to make them feel keenly the  weight of despair.* (* Voyage de Decouvertes 1 340.)    When Le Geographe stood outside Sydney Harbour, a boat's crew of  Flinders' bluejackets from the Investigator, themselves fresh from their  own long voyage, had to be sent out to work her into port. So enfeebled  were the French sailors that they could not even muster sufficient energy  to bring their vessel to the place where succour awaited them. While we  deplore this tale of distress, we can but mark the striking contrast with  the English vessel and her jolly crew. Truly, it meant something for a  commander to have learnt to manage a ship in a school nourished on the  example of Cook, whose title to fame might rest on his work as a  practical reformer of life at sea, even if his achievements as a  discoverer were not so incomparably brilliant.    We must now return to the Investigator, which, at the commencement of the  chapter, we left fighting with a contrary wind east of Kangaroo Island.  Although the sloop quitted her anchorage early on the morning of April 7,  at eight o'clock in the evening she had made very little headway across  Backstairs Passage. On the 8th, she was near enough to the mainland for  Flinders to resume his charting, and late in the afternoon of that day  occurred an incident to which the next chapter will be devoted.  Meanwhile, it is important to observe that had the wind blown from the  west or south-west, instead of from the east or south-east, Flinders  would have accomplished the survey of the coast between Cape Jervis, at  the entrance of St. Vincent's Gulf, and Cape Banks, before the French  discovery ship, Le Geographe, emerged from Bass Strait on her voyage  westward. The wind that filled Captain Baudin's sails, and drove his ship  forward towards the seas in which the Investigator was making important  discoveries, was the wind that delayed Flinders at Kangaroo Island. Had  the weather been more accommodating to the English captain and less to  the French, there cannot be the slightest doubt that even the fifty  leagues of coast, or thereabouts, which are all that can be claimed to  have been discovered by Baudin, would have been first charted by  Flinders. But the French expedition was so unfortunate, both as to  results and reputation--so undeservedly unfortunate, in some respects, as  will be shown in later chapters--that this small measure of success may  be conceded ungrudgingly. It is, indeed, somewhat to be regretted that  the small part of the Australian coast which was genuinely their own  discovery, should not have been in a more interesting region than was  actually the case; for the true \"Terre Napoleon\" is no better for the  most part than a sterile waste, with a back country of sand, swamp, and  mallee scrub, populated principally by rabbits, dingoes, and bandicoots.      CHAPTER 2. THE AFFAIR OF ENCOUNTER BAY.    Meeting of the Investigator and Le Geographe in Encounter Bay.  Flinders cautious.  Interview of the two captains.  Peron's evidence.  The chart of Bass Strait.  Second interview: Baudin inquisitive.  Baudin's account of his explorations.    On the afternoon of April 8,* (* In his manuscript journal, which was  used by the Quarterly reviewer of the first volume of the Voyage de  Decouvertes, in August 1810, Flinders gave the date on which he met Le  Geographe as April 9th (Quarterly Review volume 4 52). But there is no  contradiction. In his journal Flinders gave the date of the nautical day,  which commenced at noon. As he met Baudin's corvette in the late  afternoon, it was, by nautical reckoning, April 9th. But by the calendar,  the civil day commencing at midnight, the date was April 8th, as stated  by Flinders in his published volumes, by both Peron and Louis de  Freycinet, and in the log of Le Geographe. A similar difference of dates,  which puzzled Labilliere in writing his Early History of Victoria 1 108,  occurs as to the first sighting of Port Phillip by Flinders. It is  explained in exactly the same way.) the man at the masthead of the  Investigator reported a white rock ahead. He was mistaken. Glasses were  turned towards it, and as the distance lessened it became apparent that  the white object was a sail. The sloop was at this time in latitude 35  degrees 40 minutes south, longitude 138 degrees 58 minutes east. To meet  another vessel in this region, many leagues from regular trading routes,  in a part of the world hitherto undiscovered, was surprising. The  Investigator stood on her course, and as the strange ship became more  clearly defined it was evident that she was making towards the British  sloop. Flinders therefore \"cleared for action in case of being attacked.\"    He knew that the French Government had sent out ships having like objects  with his own; he knew that some influential persons in England,  especially the Court of Directors of the East India Company, were uneasy  and suspicious about French designs; and he had been fully instructed by  the Admiralty as to the demeanour he should maintain if he met vessels  flying a hostile flag. But though his duty prescribed that he must not  offer any provocation, he could not forget that when he left Europe Great  Britain and France were still at war, and preparation for extremities was  a measure of mere prudence.    The stranger proved to be \"a heavy-looking ship without any top-gallant  masts up.\" On the Investigator hoisting her colours, Le Geographe \"showed  a French ensign, and afterwards an English jack forward, as we did a  white flag.\" Flinders manoeuvred so as to keep his broadside to the  stranger, \"lest the flag of truce should be a deception.\" But the  demeanour of the French being purely pacific, he had a"]]]
