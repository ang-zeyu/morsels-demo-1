I have it at home, and my old  woman is waiting for me; after dinner I'll come back, and will answer you  and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as well about the  loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;\" and without  another word or waiting for a reply he made off home.    Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with  him. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young  pigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,  Carrasco fell in with his host's humour, the banquet came to an end, they  took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their conversation was  resumed.          CHAPTER IV.    IN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS AND  QUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS  WORTH KNOWING AND TELLING      Sancho came back to Don Quixote's house, and returning to the late  subject of conversation, he said, \"As to what Senor Samson said, that he  would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I say in  reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying from the  Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley slaves, and  the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my master and I  ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on his  lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the late frays  we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and I in  particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to come and  prop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of the  pack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took away  Dapple from under me without my feeling it.\"    \"That is an easy matter,\" said Don Quixote, \"and it is no new occurrence,  for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege of Albracca; the  famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his horse from  between his legs.\"    \"Day came,\" continued Sancho, \"and the moment I stirred the stakes gave  way and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I looked about for  the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my eyes and I raised  such a lamentation that, if the author of our history has not put it in,  he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing. Some days after, I  know not how many, travelling with her ladyship the Princess Micomicona,  I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress of a gipsy, was that  Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that my master and I freed  from the chain.\"    \"That is not where the mistake is,\" replied Samson; \"it is, that before  the ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted on  it.\"    \"I don't know what to say to that,\" said Sancho, \"unless that the  historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the  printer's.\"    \"No doubt that's it,\" said Samson; \"but what became of the hundred  crowns? Did they vanish?\"    To which Sancho answered, \"I spent them for my own good, and my wife's,  and my children's, and it is they that have made my wife bear so  patiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my  master, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to the  house without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor  look-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here  I am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of  anyone's whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did not  spend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be  paid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four  maravedis apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of  them. Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and  black white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\"    \"I will take care,\" said Carrasco, \"to impress upon the author of the  history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy  Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\"    \"Is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?\" asked  Don Quixote.    \"No doubt there is,\" replied he; \"but not anything that will be of the  same importance as those I have mentioned.\"    \"Does the author promise a second part at all?\" said Don Quixote.    \"He does promise one,\" replied Samson; \"but he says he has not found it,  nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear  or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever  been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don  Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are  jovial rather than saturnine, say, 'Let us have more Quixotades, let Don  Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we  shall be satisfied with that.'\"    \"And what does the author mean to do?\" said Don Quixote.    \"What?\" replied Samson; \"why, as soon as he has found the history which  he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once  give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him  from doing so than by any thought of praise.\"    Whereat Sancho observed, \"The author looks for money and profit, does he?  It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry, hurry,  with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurry are  never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master Moor, or  whatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and my master  will give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way of  adventures and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one  second part, but a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are  fast asleep in the straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod  and he will see which foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if my  master would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages  and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.\"    Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell  upon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, and  he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.  Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the  quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor  replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, and  the city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at  the festival of St. George, at which he might win renown above all the  knights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of the  world. He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, but  admonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers,  because his life did not belong to him, but to all those who had need of  him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.    \"There's where it is, what I abominate, Senor Samson,\" said Sancho here;  \"my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a  dozen melons. Body of the world, senor bachelor! there is a time to  attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always 'Santiago, and  close Spain!' Moreover, I have heard it said (and I think by my master  himself, if I remember rightly) that the mean of valour lies between the  extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, I don't want him  to fly without having good reason, or to attack when the odds make it  better not. But, above all things, I warn my master that if he is to take  me with him it must be on the condition that he is to do all the  fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anything except what  concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in this I will dance  attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even against  rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I don't set up to be a  fighting man, Senor Samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that  ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in consideration  of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the  many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts, I will take it  as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, I was born like  everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except  God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even  better, without a government than if I were a governor; and how do I know  but that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for  me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out? Sancho  I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all that, if heaven were to  make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without  much trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it;  for they say, too, 'when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and  'when good luck comes to thee, take it in.'\"    \"Brother Sancho,\" said Carrasco, \"you have spoken like a professor; but,  for all that, put your trust in God and in Senor Don Quixote, for he will  give you a kingdom, not to say an island.\"    \"It is all the same, be it more or be it less,\" replied Sancho; \"thou"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/597"],[0,"The Story of Burnt Njal: The Great Icelandic Tribune, Jurist, and Counsellor (#8)"],[1,"frame and strong will, bountiful and gentle, a fast friend, but  hard to please when making them.  He was wealthy in goods.  His  brother's name was Kolskegg; he was a tall strong man, a noble  fellow, and undaunted in everything.  Another brother's name was  Hjort; he was then in his childhood.  Orm Skogarnef was a base-  born brother of Gunnar's; he does not come into this story.  Arnguda was the name of Gunnar's sister.  Hroar, the priest at  Tongue, had her to wife (3).      ENDNOTES:    (1)  She was the daughter of Sigfuss, the son of Sighvat the Red;       he was slain at Sandhol Ferry.  (2)  He was the son of Gunnar Baugsson, after whom Gunnar's holt       is called.  Hamond's mother's name was Hrafnhilda.  She was       the daughter of Storolf Heing's son.  Storolf was brother to       Hrafn the Speaker of the Law, the son of Storolf was Orin       the Strong.  (3)  He was the son of Uni the Unborn, Gardar's son who found       Iceland.  Arnguda's son was Hamond the Halt, who dwelt at       Hamondstede.        20. OF NJAL AND HIS CHILDREN    There was a man whose name was Njal.  He was the son of Thorgeir  Gelling, the son of Thorolf.  Njal's mother's name was Asgerda  (1).  Njal dwelt at Bergthorsknoll in the land-isles; he had  another homestead on Thorolfsfell.  Njal was wealthy in goods,  and handsome of face; no beard grew on his chin.  He was so great  a lawyer, that his match was not to be found.  Wise too he was,  and foreknowing and foresighted (2).  Of good counsel, and ready  to give it, and all that he advised men was sure to be the best  for them to do.  Gentle and generous, he unravelled every man's  knotty points who came to see him about them.  Bergthora was his  wife's name; she was Skarphedinn's daughter, a very high-  spirited, brave-hearted woman, but somewhat hard-tempered.  They  had six children, three daughters and three sons, and they all  come afterwards into this story.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  She was the daughter of Lord Ar the Silent.  She had come       out hither to Iceland from Norway, and taken land to the       west of Markfleet, between Auldastone and Selialandsmull.       Her son was Holt-Thorir, the father of Thorleif Crow, from       whom the Wood-dwellers are sprung, and of Thorgrim the Tall,       and Skorargeir.  (2)  This means that Njal was one of those gifted beings who,       according to the firm belief of that age, had a more than       human insight into things about to happen.  It answers very       nearly to the Scottish \"second sight.\"        21. UNNA GOES TO SEE GUNNAR    Now it must be told how Unna had lost all her ready money.  She  made her way to Lithend, and Gunnar greeted his kinswoman well.  She stayed there that night, and the next morning they sat out of  doors and talked.  The end of their talk was, that she told him  how heavily she was pressed for money.    \"This is a bad business,\" he said.    \"What help wilt thou give me out of my distress?\" she asked.    He answered, \"Take as much money as thou needest from what I have  out at interest.\"    \"Nay,\" she said, \"I will not waste thy goods.\"    \"What then dost thou wish?\"    \"I wish thee to get back my goods out of Hrut's hands,\" she  answered.    \"That, methinks, is not likely,\" said he, \"when thy father could  not get them back, and yet he was a great lawyer, but I know  little about law.\"    She answered, \"Hrut pushed that matter through rather by boldness  than by law; besides, my father was old, and that was why men  thought it better not to drive things to the uttermost.  And now  there is none of my kinsmen to take this suit up if thou hast not  daring enough.\"    \"I have courage enough,\" he replied, \"to get these goods back;  but I do not know how to take the suit up.\"    \"Well!\" she answered, \"go and see Njal of Bergthorsknoll, he will  know how to give thee advice.  Besides, he is a great friend of  thine.\"    \"'Tis like enough he will give me good advice, as he gives it to  every one else,\" says Gunnar.    So the end of their talk was, that Gunnar undertook her cause,  and gave her the money she needed for her housekeeping, and after  that she went home.    Now Gunnar rides to see Njal, and he made him welcome, and they  began to talk at once.    Then Gunnar said, \"I am come to seek a bit of good advice from  thee.\"    Njal replied, \"Many of my friends are worthy of this, but still I  think I would take more pains for none than for thee.\"    Gunnar said, \"I wish to let thee know that I have undertaken to  get Unna's goods back from Hrut.\"    \"A very hard suit to undertake,\" said Njal, \"and one very  hazardous how it will go; but still I will get it up for thee in  the way I think likeliest to succeed, and the end will be good if  thou breakest none of the rules I lay down; if thou dost, thy  life is in danger.\"    \"Never fear; I will break none of them,\" said Gunnar.    Then Njal held his peace for a little while, and after that he  spoke as follows: --        22. NJAL'S ADVICE    \"I have thought over the suit, and it will do so.  Thou shalt ride  from home with two men at thy back.  Over all thou shalt have a  great rough cloak, and under that, a russet kirtle of cheap  stuff, and under all, thy good clothes.  Thou must take a small  axe in thy hand, and each of you must have two horses, one fat,  the other lean.  Thou shalt carry hardware and smith's work with  thee hence, and ye must ride off early to-morrow morning, and  when ye are come across Whitewater westwards, mind and slouch thy  hat well over thy brows.  Then men will ask who is this tall man,  and thy mates shall say, `Here is Huckster Hedinn the Big, a man  from Eyjafirth, who is going about with smith's work for sale.'  This Hedinn is ill-tempered and a chatterer -- a fellow who  thinks he alone knows everything.  Very often he snatches back  his wares, and flies at men if everything is not done as he  wishes.  So thou shalt ride west to Borgarfirth offering all  sorts of wares for sale, and be sure often to cry off thy  bargains, so that it will be noised abroad that Huckster Hedinn  is the worst of men to deal with, and that no lies have been told  of his bad behaviour.  So thou shalt ride to Northwaterdale, and  to Hrutfirth, and Laxriverdale, till thou comest to  Hauskuldstede.  There thou must stay a night, and sit in the  lowest place, and hang thy head down.  Hauskuld will tell them  all not to meddle nor make with Huckster Hedinn, saying he is a  rude unfriendly fellow.  Next morning thou must be off early and  go to the farm nearest Hrutstede.  There thou must offer thy  goods for sale, praising up all that is worst, and tinkering up  the faults.  The master of the house will pry about and find out  the faults.  Thou must snatch the wares away from him, and speak  ill to him.  He will say, 'twas not to be hoped that thou wouldst  behave well to him, when thou behavest ill to every one else.  Then thou shalt fly at him, though it is not thy wont, but mind  and spare thy strength, that thou mayest not be found out.  Then  a man will be sent to Hrutstede to tell Hrut he had best come and  part you.  He will come at once and ask thee to his house, and  thou must accept his offer.  Thou shalt greet Hrut and he will  answer well.  A place will be given thee on the lower bench over  against Hrut's high seat.  He will ask if thou art from the  North, and thou shalt answer that thou art a man of Eyjafirth.  He will go on to ask if there are very many famous men there.  `Shabby fellows enough and to spare,' thou must answer.  `Dost  thou know Reykiardale and the parts about?' he will ask.  To  which thou must answer, `I know all Iceland by heart.'    \"`Are there any stout champions left in Reykiardale?' he will  ask.  `Thieves and scoundrels,' thou shalt answer.  Then Hrut  will smile and think it sport to listen.  You two will go on to  talk of the men in the Eastfirth Quarter, and thou must always  find something to say against them.  At last your talk will come  Rangrivervale, and then thou must say, there is small choice of  men left in those parts since Fiddle Mord died.  At the same time  sing some stave to please Hrut, for I know thou art a skald.  Hrut will ask what makes thee say there is never a man to come in  Mord's place? and then thou must answer, that he was so wise a  man and so good a taker up of suits, that he never made a false  step in upholding his leadership.  He will ask, `Dost thou know  how matters fared between me and him?'    \"`I know all about it,' thou must reply, `he took thy wife from  thee, and thou hadst not a word to say.'    \"Then Hrut will ask, `Dost thou not think it was some disgrace to  him when he could not get back his goods, though he set the suit  on foot?'    \"`I can answer thee that well enough,' thou must say.  `Thou  challengedst him to single combat; but he was old, and so his  friends advised him not to fight with thee, and then they let the  suit fall to the ground.'    \"`True enough,' Hrut will say.  `I said so, and that passed for  law among foolish men; but the suit might have been taken up  again at another Thing if he had the heart.'    \"`I know all that,' thou must say.    \"Then he will ask, `Dost thou know anything about law?'    \"`Up in the North I am thought to know something about it,' thou  shalt say.  `But still I should like thee to tell me how this  suit should be taken up.'    \"`What suit dost thou mean?' he will ask.    \"`A suit,' thou must answer, `which does not concern me.  I want  to know how a man must set to work who wishes to get back Unna's  dower.'    \"Then Hrut will say, `In this suit I must be summoned so that I  can hear the summons, or I must be summoned here in my lawful  house.'    \"`Recite the summons, then,' thou must say, 'and I will say it  after thee.'    \"Then Hrut will summon himself; and mind and pay great heed to  every word he says.  After that Hrut will bid thee repeat the  summons, and thou must do so, and say it all"]]]
