That yellow fiend used the  light as a decoy. The branch which killed him jutted out over the path  at a spot where an opening in the foliage above allowed some moon rays  to penetrate. Directly the victim stood beneath, the Chinaman uttered  his bird cry; the one below looked up, and the cat, previously held  silent and helpless in the leather sack, was dropped accurately upon his  head!\"    \"But\"--I was growing confused.    Smith stooped lower.    \"The cat's claws are sheathed now,\" he said; \"but if you could examine  them you would find that they are coated with a shining black substance.  Only Fu-Manchu knows what that substance is, Petrie, but you and I know  what it can do!\"        CHAPTER VII. ENTER MR. ABEL SLATTIN    \"I don't blame you!\" rapped Nayland Smith. \"Suppose we say, then, a  thousand pounds if you show us the present hiding-place of Fu-Manchu,  the payment to be in no way subject to whether we profit by your  information or not?\"    Abel Slattin shrugged his shoulders, racially, and returned to the  armchair which he had just quitted. He reseated himself, placing his hat  and cane upon my writing-table.    \"A little agreement in black and white?\" he suggested smoothly.    Smith raised himself up out of the white cane chair, and, bending  forward over a corner of the table, scribbled busily upon a sheet of  notepaper with my fountain-pen.    The while he did so, I covertly studied our visitor. He lay back in  the armchair, his heavy eyelids lowered deceptively. He was a thought  overdressed--a big man, dark-haired and well groomed, who toyed with a  monocle most unsuitable to his type. During the preceding conversation,  I had been vaguely surprised to note Mr. Abel Slattin's marked American  accent.    Sometimes, when Slattin moved, a big diamond which he wore upon the  third finger of his right hand glittered magnificently. There was a sort  of bluish tint underlying the dusky skin, noticeable even in his hands  but proclaiming itself significantly in his puffy face and especially  under the eyes. I diagnosed a laboring valve somewhere in the heart  system.    Nayland Smith's pen scratched on. My glance strayed from our Semitic  caller to his cane, lying upon the red leather before me. It was of most  unusual workmanship, apparently Indian, being made of some kind of dark  brown, mottled wood, bearing a marked resemblance to a snake's skin; and  the top of the cane was carved in conformity, to represent the head  of what I took to be a puff-adder, fragments of stone, or beads, being  inserted to represent the eyes, and the whole thing being finished with  an artistic realism almost startling.    When Smith had tossed the written page to Slattin, and he, having read  it with an appearance of carelessness, had folded it neatly and placed  it in his pocket, I said:    \"You have a curio here?\"    Our visitor, whose dark eyes revealed all the satisfaction which, by his  manner, he sought to conceal, nodded and took up the cane in his hand.    \"It comes from Australia, Doctor,\" he replied; \"it's aboriginal work,  and was given to me by a client. You thought it was Indian? Everybody  does. It's my mascot.\"    \"Really?\"    \"It is indeed. Its former owner ascribed magical powers to it! In  fact, I believe he thought that it was one of those staffs mentioned in  biblical history--\"    \"Aaron's rod?\" suggested Smith, glancing at the cane.    \"Something of the sort,\" said Slattin, standing up and again preparing  to depart.    \"You will 'phone us, then?\" asked my friend.    \"You will hear from me to-morrow,\" was the reply.    Smith returned to the cane armchair, and Slattin, bowing to both of us,  made his way to the door as I rang for the girl to show him out.    \"Considering the importance of his proposal,\" I began, as the door  closed, \"you hardly received our visitor with cordiality.\"    \"I hate to have any relations with him,\" answered my friend; \"but we  must not be squeamish respecting our instruments in dealing with Dr.  Fu-Manchu. Slattin has a rotten reputation--even for a private inquiry  agent. He is little better than a blackmailer--\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"Because I called on our friend Weymouth at the Yard yesterday and  looked up the man's record.\"    \"Whatever for?\"    \"I knew that he was concerning himself, for some reason, in the case.  Beyond doubt he has established some sort of communication with the  Chinese group; I am only wondering--\"    \"You don't mean--\"    \"Yes--I do, Petrie! I tell you he is unscrupulous enough to stoop even  to that.\"    No doubt, Slattin knew that this gaunt, eager-eyed Burmese commissioner  was vested with ultimate authority in his quest of the mighty Chinaman  who represented things unutterable, whose potentialities for evil were  boundless as his genius, who personified a secret danger, the extent  and nature of which none of us truly understood. And, learning of these  things, with unerring Semitic instinct he had sought an opening in this  glittering Rialto. But there were two bidders!    \"You think he may have sunk so low as to become a creature of  Fu-Manchu?\" I asked, aghast.    \"Exactly! If it paid him well I do not doubt that he would serve that  master as readily as any other. His record is about as black as it  well could be. Slattin is of course an assumed name; he was known as  Lieutenant Pepley when he belonged to the New York Police, and he was  kicked out of the service for complicity in an unsavory Chinatown case.\"    \"Chinatown!\"    \"Yes, Petrie, it made me wonder, too; and we must not forget that he is  undeniably a clever scoundrel.\"    \"Shall you keep any appointment which he may suggest?\"    \"Undoubtedly. But I shall not wait until tomorrow.\"    \"What!\"    \"I propose to pay a little informal visit to Mr. Abel Slattin,  to-night.\"    \"At his office?\"    \"No; at his private residence. If, as I more than suspect, his object  is to draw us into some trap, he will probably report his favorable  progress to his employer to-night!\"    \"Then we should have followed him!\"    Nayland Smith stood up and divested himself of the old shooting-jacket.    \"He has been followed, Petrie,\" he replied, with one of his rare smiles.  \"Two C.I.D. men have been watching the house all night!\"    This was entirely characteristic of my friend's farseeing methods.    \"By the way,\" I said, \"you saw Eltham this morning. He will soon be  convalescent. Where, in heaven's name, can he--\"    \"Don't be alarmed on his behalf, Petrie,\" interrupted Smith. \"His life  is no longer in danger.\"    I stared, stupidly.    \"No longer in danger!\"    \"He received, some time yesterday, a letter, written in Chinese, upon  Chinese paper, and enclosed in an ordinary business envelope, having a  typewritten address and bearing a London postmark.\"    \"Well?\"    \"As nearly as I can render the message in English, it reads: 'Although,  because you are a brave man, you would not betray your correspondent in  China, he has been discovered. He was a mandarin, and as I cannot write  the name of a traitor, I may not name him. He was executed four days  ago. I salute you and pray for your speedy recovery. Fu-Manchu.'\"    \"Fu-Manchu! But it is almost certainly a trap.\"    \"On the contrary, Petrie--Fu-Manchu would not have written in Chinese  unless he were sincere; and, to clear all doubt, I received a cable this  morning reporting that the Mandarin Yen-Sun-Yat was assassinated in his  own garden, in Nan-Yang, one day last week.\"        CHAPTER VIII. DR. FU-MANCHU STRIKES    Together we marched down the slope of the quiet, suburban avenue; to  take pause before a small, detached house displaying the hatchet boards  of the Estate Agent. Here we found unkempt laurel bushes and acacias  run riot, from which arboreal tangle protruded the notice--\"To be Let or  Sold.\"    Smith, with an alert glance to right and left, pushed open the wooden  gate and drew me in upon the gravel path. Darkness mantled all; for the  nearest street lamp was fully twenty yards beyond.    From the miniature jungle bordering the path, a soft whistle sounded.    \"Is that Carter?\" called Smith, sharply.    A shadowy figure uprose, and vaguely I made it out for that of a man in  the unobtrusive blue serge which is the undress uniform of the Force.    \"Well?\" rapped my companion.    \"Mr. Slattin returned ten minutes ago, sir,\" reported the constable. \"He  came in a cab which he dismissed--\"    \"He has not left again?\"    \"A few minutes after his return,\" the man continued, \"another cab came  up, and a lady alighted.\"    \"A lady!\"    \"The same, sir, that has called upon him before.\"    \"Smith!\" I whispered, plucking at his arm--\"is it--\"    He half turned, nodding his head; and my heart began to throb foolishly.  For now the manner of Slattin's campaign suddenly was revealed to me. In  our operations against the Chinese murder-group two years before, we had  had an ally in the enemy's camp--Karamaneh the beautiful slave, whose  presence in those happenings of the past had colored the sometimes  sordid drama with the opulence of old Arabia; who had seemed a fitting  figure for the romances of Bagdad during the Caliphate--Karamaneh, whom  I had thought sincere, whose inscrutable Eastern soul I had presumed,  fatuously, to have laid bare and analyzed.    Now, once again she was plying her old trade of go-between; professing  to reveal the secrets of Dr. Fu-Manchu, and all the time--I could not  doubt it--inveigling men into the net of this awful fisher.    Yesterday, I had been her dupe; yesterday, I had rejoiced in my  captivity. To-day, I was not the favored one; to-day I had not been  selected recipient of her confidences--confidences sweet, seductive,  deadly: but Abel Slattin, a plausible rogue, who, in justice, should  be immured in Sing Sing, was chosen out, was enslaved by those lovely  mysterious eyes, was taking to his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11863"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

He was considered to have a first-rate show of tulips, and  spent much of his time in their cultivation; the remainder of the bed  was knocked down for L500. The above gentleman was an infatuated  admirer of Miss Kemble, and, as a token of his admiration he named his  favourite tulip after her. He was a man of the most eccentric habits:  though possessed of a competent fortune, he was continually harrassed  by the fear of coming to poverty--and so powerfully was he impressed  with the dread of being buried in a trance, that he ordered in his  will, two panes of glass to be introduced in his coffin lid, and that  he should be placed in the vault without being screwed down.

The following motto for a tea-caddy was quoted by the celebrated J.  Wilkes:      Te veniente die, Te discedente.    And when Dr. Johnson complained to Mrs. Piozzi, that her tea was so  strong as to make him tipsy, he was thus answered by that learned  lady:      Equidem de Te nil tale verebar.

When they  obtained admission into the presence of Damel, they announced the  object of their embassy in the following manner:--\"With this knife,\"  said the ambassador, \"Abdulkader will condescend to shave the head of  Damel, if Damel will embrace the Mahomedan faith; and with this other  knife, Abdulkader will cut the throat of Damel, if Damel refuses to  embrace it--take your choice.\" Damel coolly replied, \"That he had no  choice to make; he neither chose to have his head shaved nor his  throat cut;\" and with this answer the ambassador was civilly  dismissed.

I once desired Lord Bolingbroke to observe that the clerks used  an ivory knife, with a blunt edge, to divide paper, which cut it even,  only requiring a strong hand; whereas a sharp penknife would go out of  the crease, and disfigure the paper.

Besides which, being  calculated to last only ten years, the owners should be able to lay by  a sinking fund, or reserve of 2,000_l._ per annum, and 1,500_l._ for a  new set of boilers during that time, making altogether the sailing  expenses of such a vessel about 1,000_l._ per month.           *       *       *       *       *        THE LATE SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.           *       *       *       *       *      Price Twopence,      AN ILLUSTRATED SUPPLEMENT,    Containing NOTICES of the LIFE and WRITINGS      of the late    SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.
