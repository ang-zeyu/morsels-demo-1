In King Charles  II.'s time it was ordered to be surrounded with a pale; but as great part  of the paling is down with age, whether the tree be really so old or not  is to me a great question, the action being near seven hundred years ago.    I cannot omit to mention here a proposal made a few years ago to the late  Lord Treasurer Godolphin for re-peopling this forest, which for some  reasons I can be more particular in than any man now left alive, because  I had the honour to draw up the scheme and argue it before that noble  lord and some others who were principally concerned at that time in  bringing over--or, rather, providing for when they were come over--the  poor inhabitants of the Palatinate, a thing in itself commendable, but,  as it was managed, made scandalous to England and miserable to those poor  people.    Some persons being ordered by that noble lord above mentioned to consider  of measures how the said poor people should be provided for, and whether  they could be provided for or no without injury to the public, the answer  was grounded upon this maxim--that the number of inhabitants is the  wealth and strength of a kingdom, provided those inhabitants were such as  by honest industry applied themselves to live by their labour, to  whatsoever trades or employments they were brought up.  In the next  place, it was inquired what employments those poor people were brought up  to.  It was answered there were husbandmen and artificers of all sorts,  upon which the proposal was as follows.  New Forest, in Hampshire, was  singled out to be the place:--    Here it was proposed to draw a great square line containing four thousand  acres of land, marking out two large highways or roads through the  centre, crossing both ways, so that there should be a thousand acres in  each division, exclusive of the land contained in the said cross-roads.    Then it was proposed to send out twenty men and their families, who  should be recommended as honest industrious men, expert in, or at least  capable of being instructed in husbandry, curing and cultivating of land,  breeding and feeding cattle, and the like.  To each of these should be  parcelled out, in equal distributions, two hundred acres of this land, so  that the whole four thousand acres should be fully distributed to the  said twenty families, for which they should have no rent to pay, and be  liable to no taxes but such as provided for their own sick or poor,  repairing their own roads, and the like.  This exemption from rent and  taxes to continue for twenty years, and then to pay each 50 pounds a year  to the queen--that is to say, to the Crown.    To each of these families, whom I would now call farmers, it was proposed  to advance 200 pounds in ready money as a stock to set them to work; to  furnish them with cattle, horses, cows, hogs, &c.; and to hire and pay  labourers to inclose, clear, and cure the land, which it would be  supposed the first year would not be so much to their advantage as  afterwards, allowing them timber out of the forest to build themselves  houses and barns, sheds and offices, as they should have occasion; also  for carts, waggons, ploughs, harrows, and the like necessary things: care  to be taken that the men and their families went to work forthwith  according to the design.    Thus twenty families would be immediately supplied and provided for, for  there would be no doubt but these families, with so much land given them  gratis, and so much money to work with, would live very well; but what  would this do for the support of the rest, who were supposed to be, to  every twenty farmers, forty or fifty families of other people (some of  one trade, some of another), with women and children?  To this it was  answered that these twenty farmers would, by the consequence of their own  settlements, provide for and employ such a proportion of others of their  own people that, by thus providing for twenty families in a place, the  whole number of Palatinates would have been provided for, had they been  twenty thousand more in number than they were, and that without being any  burden upon or injury to the people of England; on the contrary, they  would have been an advantage and an addition of wealth and strength to  the nation, and to the country in particular where they should be thus  seated.  For example:--    As soon as the land was marked out, the farmers put in possession of it,  and the money given them, they should be obliged to go to work, in order  to their settlement.  Suppose it, then, to be in the spring of the year,  when such work was most proper.  First, all hands would be required to  fence and part off the land, and clear it of the timber or bushes, or  whatever else was upon it which required to be removed.  The first thing,  therefore, which the farmer would do would be to single out from the rest  of their number every one three servants--that is to say, two men and a  maid; less could not answer the preparations they would be obliged to  make, and yet work hard themselves also.  By the help of these they  would, with good management, soon get so much of their land cured, fenced-  off, ploughed, and sowed as should yield them a sufficiency of corn and  kitchen stuff the very first year, both for horse-meat, hog-meat, food  for the family, and some to carry to market, too, by which to bring in  money to go farther on, as above.    At the first entrance they were to have the tents allowed them to live  in, which they then had from the Tower; but as soon as leisure and  conveniences admitted, every farmer was obliged to begin to build him a  farm-house, which he would do gradually, some and some, as he could spare  time from his other works, and money from his little stock.    In order to furnish himself with carts, waggons, ploughs, harrows, wheel-  barrows, hurdles, and all such necessary utensils of husbandry, there  would be an absolute necessity of wheelwrights or cartwrights, one at  least to each division.    Thus, by the way, there would be employed three servants to each farmer,  that makes sixty persons.    Four families of wheelwrights, one to each division--which, suppose five  in a family, makes twenty persons.  Suppose four head-carpenters, with  each three men; and as at first all would be building together, they  would to every house building have at least one labourer.  Four families  of carpenters, five to each family, and three servants, is thirty-two  persons; one labourer to each house building is twenty persons more.    Thus here would be necessarily brought together in the very first of the  work one hundred and thirty-two persons, besides the head-farmers, who at  five also to each family are one hundred more; in all, two hundred and  thirty-two.    For the necessary supply of these with provisions, clothes, household  stuff, &c. (for all should be done among themselves), first, they must  have at least four butchers with their families (twenty persons), four  shoemakers with their families and each shoemaker two journeymen (for  every trade would increase the number of customers to every trade).  This  is twenty-eight persons more.    They would then require a hatmaker, a glover, at least two ropemakers,  four tailors, three weavers of woollen and three weavers of linen, two  basket-makers, two common brewers, ten or twelve shop-keepers to furnish  chandlery and grocery wares, and as many for drapery and mercery, over  and above what they could work.  This makes two-and-forty families more,  each at five in a family, which, is two hundred and ten persons; all the  labouring part of these must have at least two servants (the brewers  more), which I cast up at forty more.    Add to these two ministers, one clerk, one sexton or grave-digger, with  their families, two physicians, three apothecaries, two surgeons (less  there could not be, only that for the beginning it might be said the  physicians should be surgeons, and I take them so); this is forty-five  persons, besides servants; so that, in short--to omit many tradesmen more  who would be wanted among them--there would necessarily and voluntarily  follow to these twenty families of farmers at least six hundred more of  their own people.    It is no difficult thing to show that the ready money of 4,000 pounds  which the Government was to advance to those twenty farmers would employ  and pay, and consequently subsist, all these numerous dependants in the  works which must severally be done for them for the first year, after  which the farmers would begin to receive their own money back again; for  all these tradesmen must come to their own market to buy corn, flesh,  milk, butter, cheese, bacon, &c., which after the first year the farmers,  having no rent to pay, would have to spare sufficiently, and so take back  their own money with advantage.  I need not go on to mention how, by  consequence provisions increasing and money circulating, this town should  increase in a very little time.    It was proposed also that for the encouragement of all the handicraftsmen  and labouring poor who, either as servants or as labourers for day-work,  assisted the farmers or other tradesmen, they should have every man three  acres of ground given them, with leave to build cottages upon the same,  the allotments to be upon the waste at the end of the cross-roads where  they entered the town.    In the centre of the square was laid out a circle of twelve acres of  ground, to be cast into streets for inhabitants to build on as their  ability would permit--all that would build to have ground gratis for  twenty years, timber out of the forest, and convenient yards, gardens,  and orchards allotted to every house.    In the great streets near where they cross each other was to be built a  handsome market-house, with a town-hall for parish or corporation  business, doing justice and the like; also "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11498"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 601, July 9, 1887 (#9)"],[1," or three spare frames with \"mantles\" can be kept in the house in  case of accident. Whoever sees the Welsbach incandescent light in  operation will readily admit that it is the \"coming light.\" It has  beauty, brilliancy, purity, and economy all on its side.    Let us hope (added the chairman) this description is not overdrawn; but  of this you will later on have an opportunity of judging for yourselves.  No doubt the general or even partial adoption of this light would have a  tendency to reduce the consumption of gas, as a smaller quantity would  be required to produce the same amount of illumination. Nevertheless,  gas engineers will hail it with approval if it in any way tends to  popularize the use of gas, and helps to increase the comfort and improve  the sanitation of our houses, churches, halls, etc. Moreover, gas is  continually being adopted for fresh purposes; and we can confidently  look forward to an almost unlimited field in the rapid and ever  increasing use of gas as a fuel and for cooking purposes, as well as for  motive power. The new and really excellent gas engines now being brought  into the market will, no doubt, create a healthy rivalry, and tend to  cheapen these useful machines, and so bring them within the reach of  many persons who have hitherto been prevented from employing them by  their considerable first cost.      PARAFFIN AS A RIVAL OF COAL GAS.    But while the day has gone by when any one of us fears the electric  light as a possible rival, we are not insensible to the fact that  paraffin oil, from its present low-price, is a rival which we cannot  afford to despise. And more especially is this the case in many of the  smaller towns and villages, where the charge for gas is of necessity  higher than in the larger towns.    Doubtless, with oil there is not the same cleanliness as with gas; while  there is also more trouble, attention, and considerable danger attending  its use. Still, in these \"hard times,\" most people are inclined to adopt  the cheapest article, even at the cost of these drawbacks, so as to make  their money go as far as possible.    But not only as an illuminant is it being brought into direct  competition with gas, but also as a fuel and for cooking purposes, as  well as for motive power. And I am inclined to think that the sooner we  set about trying to solve the problem of how to meet this new  competitor, the better.      OIL IN GAS MAKING.    A new departure has also recently taken place in the adoption of oil for  gas making purposes. This, of course, is more fraught with danger to the  coal master than to gas companies, inasmuch as, should this prove to be  a more economical raw material from which to produce illuminating gas  than coal, our present coal gas works could be easily remodeled and  turned into oil gas works. This process has recently been introduced  into a village in Fifeshire. And I have made it a point to visit and  inspect the works, which have been converted into an oil gas works, so  that I might be able to lay a few particulars before you. The process,  however, has not been in operation long enough to enable me to give you  much information on the subject, especially in the way of details of  cost, working expenses, or permanency of the gas under varying and low  temperatures. The patentees claim that they can produce 100 cubic feet  of 60 candle gas from a gallon of oil, or at a cost of 3s. 11d. per  1,000 cubic feet for oil, fuel, and labor; no more expense being  incurred, as the gas does not require purification.    At Colinsburgh (the village alluded to), I was informed that the man  sent by the patentees could produce 100 cubic feet of gas per gallon of  oil; but they had no means of testing the illuminating power. The gas  company's own servant, however, only produced 80 cubic feet per gallon,  which they attributed to his want of experience in knowing the proper  heat at which to work the retorts. Whether or not this was so I cannot  tell; but of this I am certain, that the statement made that the gas  does not require purification will not bear investigation. When I tested  it for sulphureted hydrogen and for ammonia, both were indicated in such  an unmistakable manner as none of us would care to see in our coal gas  as sent out to the consumer.      PRICES OF RESIDUAL PRODUCTS.    What is of far more real consequence to us than the possible change from  coal gas to oil gas, however, as long as we remain manufacturers of the  former, is the value of our residual products, which has suffered so  great and sudden a decline in value, for which various remedies have  been proposed, though none of them, I regret to say, have as yet  restored anything like the former value. A statement of the highest  prices realized for coal tar products, and a comparison with those  obtained on the 30th of March last year and at the same time this year,  may not be uninteresting:      +--------------------------------------------------------------------+    |                     | Highest      | Price on      | Price on      |    |                     | Price        | March 30,     | March 30,     |    |                     |              | 1886          | 1887          |    |                     |--------------+---------------+---------------+    |                     |   per gal.   |    per gal.   | per gal.      |    |                     |----+----+----+---+-----------+---------------+    |                     | L  | s. | d. | L  | s. |  d. | L  | s. | d.  |    |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+    |Crude naphtha        |  0 |  4 |  0 |  0 | 0  |  41/2 |  0 |  0 |  81/2 |    |Benzol (90 per cent.)|  0 | 15 |  0 |  0 | 1  |  4  |  0 |  2 |  6  |    |Solvent naphtha      |  0 |  2 |  6 |  0 | 1  |  0  |  0 |  1 |  2  |    |Burning naphtha      |  0 |  1 |  7 |  0 | 0  | 101/2 |  0 |  0 | 10  |    |Creosote oil         |  0 |  0 |  3 |  0 | 0  |  03/4 |  0 |  0 |  1  |    |                     |              |               |               |    |                     |   per ton.   |     per ton.  |    per ton.   |    |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+    |                     | L  | s. | d. | L  | s. |  d. | L  | s. | d.  |    |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+    |Pitch                |  1 | 14 |  0 |  0 | 15 |   0 |  0 | 12 |  6  |    |Sulphate of ammonia  | 21 |  5 |  0 | 13 | 10 |   0 | 11 | 10 |  0  |    +--------------------------------------------------------------------+    This shows a great fall in value from highest to lowest, which seems to  have been touched last year, except in the case of pitch and sulphate of  ammonia, both of which have marked a considerable decline, even since  last year, but it is pleasing to note that the others have shown at  least some slight improvement--crude naphtha and benzol having during  the year risen nearly one hundred per cent. in value. Let us hope that  this is the precursor of a general rise in value from which we shall all  profit. For the purpose of bringing about this much desired end, I  understand that some of the gentlemen present to-day have been burning  their tar in the retort furnaces, and as it will be interesting to know  what success they have attained, I hope some of them will favor us with  their experience on this subject.    In conclusion, let me express the hope that the time is not far distant  when the general trade of the country will attain to its wonted  prosperity, by which every branch of industry will benefit--ours among  the number; and that the hard times we have experienced, now for a  considerable number of years, may not again return.    Discussion next took place regarding the Welsbach incandescence gas  light, which was opened by Mr. McGrilchrist, who remarked on the very  fragile and tender nature of the \"mantle,\" and expressed a hope that in  this direction improvement might be looked for. It was certainly a  beautiful light, and as to its consumption, he stated that the lamp then  shown to the meeting was only burning two cubic feet of gas per hour. [A  voice: Two and two-tenths.] He felt satisfied that it would enable the  manufacturers of gas to compete with paraffin oil, so that with Glasgow  gas they could have such a light as they saw at the rate of 4d. for  about fifty hours.    Mr. W. Key (Tradeston Gas Works) made a statement giving the results of  inquiries he had made at St. Enoch Station Hotel, where the light has  for some time been on exhibition. From the answers given to his  inquiries he spoke rather disparagingly of the lamp, but chiefly on  account of the expense involved in renewing the \"mantles\" and the glass  chimneys. He admitted, however, that the lamps which he had seen were  placed very unfavorably, being exposed to the action of somewhat violent  draughts, and he subsequently remarked that the lamp was of such a  nature as to effect the complete combustion of the carbon contained in  the gas. The burner must, therefore, be regarded as a great boon--as  _the_ burner, in short.    Mr. D.M. Nelson (Glasgow) gave his experience gained in connection with  the light, remarking that one of the great drawbacks to it was the very  great rarity of the mineral from which the zirconium was obtained. So  scarce was it that it would become dearer than platinum and more  valuable than gold if the lamp came into general use. The light which  the lamp gave out, though it possessed intensity, was deficient in  diffusibility as compared with that given out from ordinary flat flame  gas burners, and this was another objection to it. He argued at some  length against the financial aspects of the scheme which was being  promoted to buy up the Welsbach patents, and to introduce the lamp into  this country. His advice to his friends was not to have anything to do  with the Welsbach company, and, as investors, to be very careful in  accepting all"]]]
