Man does not wish to know the law of  nature,--children. But children are born and become an embarrassment.  Then man devises means of avoiding this embarrassment. We have not  yet reached the low level of Europe, nor Paris, nor the 'system of two  children,' nor Mahomet. We have discovered nothing, because we have  given it no thought. We feel that there is something bad in the two  first means; but we wish to preserve the family, and our view of woman  is still worse.    \"With us woman must be at the same time mistress and nurse, and her  strength is not sufficient. That is why we have hysteria, nervous  attacks, and, among the peasants, witchcraft. Note that among the young  girls of the peasantry this state of things does not exist, but only  among the wives, and the wives who live with their husbands. The reason  is clear, and this is the cause of the intellectual and moral decline of  woman, and of her abasement.    \"If they would only reflect what a grand work for the wife is the period  of gestation! In her is forming the being who continues us, and  this holy work is thwarted and rendered painful . . . by what? It is  frightful to think of it! And after that they talk of the liberties and  the rights of woman! It is like the cannibals fattening their prisoners  in order to devour them, and assuring these unfortunates at the same  time that their rights and their liberties are guarded!\"    All this was new to me, and astonished me very much.    \"But if this is so,\" said I, \"it follows that one may love his wife only  once every two years; and as man\" . . .    \"And as man has need of her, you are going to say. At least, so the  priests of science assure us. I would force these priests to fulfil the  function of these women, who, in their opinion, are necessary to man. I  wonder what song they would sing then. Assure man that he needs brandy,  tobacco, opium, and he will believe those poisons necessary. It follows  that God did not know how to arrange matters properly, since, without  asking the opinions of the priests, he has combined things as they are.  Man needs, so they have decided, to satisfy his sensual desire, and here  this function is disturbed by the birth and the nursing of children.    \"What, then, is to be done? Why, apply to the priests; they will arrange  everything, and they have really discovered a way. When, then, will  these rascals with their lies be uncrowned! It is high time. We have had  enough of them. People go mad, and shoot each other with revolvers, and  always because of that! And how could it be otherwise?    \"One would say that the animals know that descent continues their race,  and that they follow a certain law in regard thereto. Only man does not  know this, and is unwilling to know it. He cares only to have as much  sensual enjoyment as possible. The king of nature,--man! In the name of  his love he kills half the human race. Of woman, who ought to be his aid  in the movement of humanity toward liberty, he makes, in the name of his  pleasures, not an aid, but an enemy. Who is it that everywhere puts a  check upon the progressive movement of humanity? Woman. Why is it so?    \"For the reason that I have given, and for that reason only.\"        CHAPTER XIV.    \"Yes, much worse than the animal is man when he does not live as a man.  Thus was I. The horrible part is that I believed, inasmuch as I did not  allow myself to be seduced by other women that I was leading an  honest family life, that I was a very mortal being, and that if we had  quarrels, the fault was in my wife, and in her character.    \"But it is evident that the fault was not in her. She was like everybody  else, like the majority. She was brought up according to the principles  exacted by the situation of our society,--that is, as all the young  girls of our wealthy classes, without exception, are brought up, and  as they cannot fail to be brought up. How many times we hear or read  of reflections upon the abnormal condition of women, and upon what  they ought to be. But these are only vain words. The education of women  results from the real and not imaginary view which the world entertains  of women's vocation. According to this view, the condition of women  consists in procuring pleasure and it is to that end that her education  is directed. From her infancy she is taught only those things that are  calculated to increase her charm. Every young girl is accustomed to  think only of that.    \"As the serfs were brought up solely to please their masters, so woman  is brought up to attract men. It cannot be otherwise. But you will say,  perhaps, that that applies only to young girls who are badly brought up,  but that there is another education, an education that is serious, in  the schools, an education in the dead languages, an education in the  institutions of midwifery, an education in medical courses, and in other  courses. It is false.    \"Every sort of feminine education has for its sole object the attraction  of men.    \"Some attract by music or curly hair, others by science or by civic  virtue. The object is the same, and cannot be otherwise (since no other  object exists),--to seduce man in order to possess him. Imagine courses  of instruction for women and feminine science without men,--that  is, learned women, and men not KNOWING them as learned. Oh, no! No  education, no instruction can change woman as long as her highest ideal  shall be marriage and not virginity, freedom from sensuality. Until  that time she will remain a serf. One need only imagine, forgetting the  universality of the case, the conditions in which our young girls are  brought up, to avoid astonishment at the debauchery of the women of our  upper classes. It is the opposite that would cause astonishment.    \"Follow my reasoning. From infancy garments, ornaments, cleanliness,  grace, dances, music, reading of poetry, novels, singing, the theatre,  the concert, for use within and without, according as women listen, or  practice themselves. With that, complete physical idleness, an excessive  care of the body, a vast consumption of sweetmeats; and God knows how  the poor maidens suffer from their own sensuality, excited by all these  things. Nine out of ten are tortured intolerably during the first period  of maturity, and afterward provided they do not marry at the age of  twenty. That is what we are unwilling to see, but those who have  eyes see it all the same. And even the majority of these unfortunate  creatures are so excited by a hidden sensuality (and it is lucky if it  is hidden) that they are fit for nothing. They become animated only  in the presence of men. Their whole life is spent in preparations for  coquetry, or in coquetry itself. In the presence of men they become too  animated; they begin to live by sensual energy. But the moment the man  goes away, the life stops.    \"And that, not in the presence of a certain man, but in the presence of  any man, provided he is not utterly hideous. You will say that this is  an exception. No, it is a rule. Only in some it is made very evident, in  other less so. But no one lives by her own life; they are all dependent  upon man. They cannot be otherwise, since to them the attraction of the  greatest number of men is the ideal of life (young girls and married  women), and it is for this reason that they have no feeling stronger  than that of the animal need of every female who tries to attract the  largest number of males in order to increase the opportunities for  choice. So it is in the life of young girls, and so it continues  during marriage. In the life of young girls it is necessary in order to  selection, and in marriage it is necessary in order to rule the  husband. Only one thing suppresses or interrupts these tendencies for  a time,--namely, children,--and then only when the woman is not a  monster,--that is, when she nurses her own children. Here again the  doctor interferes.    \"With my wife, who desired to nurse her own children, and who did nurse  six of them, it happened that the first child was sickly. The doctors,  who cynically undressed her and felt of her everywhere, and whom I had  to thank and pay for these acts,--these dear doctors decided that she  ought not to nurse her child, and she was temporarily deprived of  the only remedy for coquetry. A nurse finished the nursing of this  first-born,--that is to say, we profited by the poverty and ignorance of  a woman to steal her from her own little one in favor of ours, and for  that purpose we dressed her in a kakoschnik trimmed with gold lace.  Nevertheless, that is not the question; but there was again awakened in  my wife that coquetry which had been sleeping during the nursing period.  Thanks to that, she reawakened in me the torments of jealousy which I  had formerly known, though in a much slighter degree.\"        CHAPTER XV.    \"Yes, jealousy, that is another of the secrets of marriage known to all  and concealed by all. Besides the general cause of the mutual hatred of  husbands and wives resulting from complicity in the pollution of a human  being, and also from other causes, the inexhaustible source of marital  wounds is jealousy. But by tacit consent it is determined to conceal  them from all, and we conceal them. Knowing them, each one supposes in  himself that it is an unfortunate peculiarity, and not a common destiny.  So it was with me, and it had to be so. There cannot fail to be jealousy  between husbands and wives who live immorally. If they cannot sacrifice  their pleasures for the welfare of their child, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/690"],[0,"Proposed Roads to Freedom (#8)"],[1,"migrated to Dresden, where  he became associated with Arnold Ruge, the publisher  of ``Deutsche Jahrbuecher.'' By this time he had  become a revolutionary, and in the following year  he incurred the hostility of the Saxon Government.  This led him to go to Switzerland, where he came in  contact with a group of German Communists, but, as  the Swiss police importuned him and the Russian  Government demanded his return, he removed to  Paris, where he remained from 1843 to 1847. These  years in Paris were important in the formation of his  outlook and opinions. He became acquainted with  Proudhon, who exercised a considerable influence on  him; also with George Sand and many other well-  known people. It was in Paris that he first made  the acquaintance of Marx and Engels, with whom he  was to carry on a lifelong battle. At a much later  period, in 1871, he gave the following account of his  relations with Marx at this time:--      Marx was much more advanced than I was, as he  remains to-day not more advanced but incomparably more  learned than I am. I knew then nothing of political  economy. I had not yet rid myself of metaphysical  abstractions, and my Socialism was only instinctive. He,  though younger than I, was already an atheist, an  instructed materialist, a well-considered Socialist. It  was just at this time that he elaborated the first foundations  of his present system. We saw each other fairly  often, for I respected him much for his learning and his  passionate and serious devotion (always mixed, however,  with personal vanity) to the cause of the proletariat,  and I sought eagerly his conversation, which was always  instructive and clever, when it was not inspired by a  paltry hate, which, alas! happened only too often. But  there was never any frank intimacy between as. Our  temperaments would not suffer it. He called me a  sentimental idealist, and he was right; I called him a  vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.      Bakunin never succeeded in staying long in one  place without incurring the enmity of the authorities.  In November, 1847, as the result of a speech  praising the Polish rising of 1830, he was expelled  from France at the request of the Russian Embassy,  which, in order to rob him of public sympathy, spread  the unfounded report that he had been an agent of  the Russian Government, but was no longer wanted  because he had gone too far. The French Government,  by calculated reticence, encouraged this story,  which clung to him more or less throughout his life.    Being compelled to leave France, he went to  Brussels, where he renewed acquaintance with Marx.  A letter of his, written at this time, shows that he  entertained already that bitter hatred for which  afterward he had so much reason. ``The Germans,  artisans, Bornstedt, Marx and Engels--and, above  all, Marx--are here, doing their ordinary mischief.  Vanity, spite, gossip, theoretical overbearingness  and practical pusillanimity--reflections on life, action  and simplicity, and complete absence of life,  action and simplicity--literary and argumentative  artisans and repulsive coquetry with them: `Feuerbach  is a bourgeois,' and the word `bourgeois' grown  into an epithet and repeated ad nauseum, but all of  them themselves from head to foot, through and  through, provincial bourgeois. With one word, lying  and stupidity, stupidity and lying. In this society  there is no possibility of drawing a free, full breath.  I hold myself aloof from them, and have declared  quite decidedly that I will not join their communistic  union of artisans, and will have nothing to do  with it.''    The Revolution of 1848 led him to return to Paris  and thence to Germany. He had a quarrel with  Marx over a matter in which he himself confessed  later that Marx was in the right. He became a member  of the Slav Congress in Prague, where he vainly  endeavored to promote a Slav insurrection. Toward  the end of 1848, he wrote an ``Appeal to Slavs,''  calling on them to combine with other revolutionaries  to destroy the three oppressive monarchies, Russia,  Austria and Prussia. Marx attacked him in print,  saying, in effect, that the movement for Bohemian  independence was futile because the Slavs had no  future, at any rate in those regions where they hap-  pened to be subject to Germany and Austria.  Bakunin accused Mars of German patriotism in  this matter, and Marx accused him of Pan-Slavism,  no doubt in both cases justly. Before this dispute,  however, a much more serious quarrel had taken  place. Marx's paper, the ``Neue Rheinische Zeitung,''  stated that George Sand had papers proving  Bakunin to be a Russian Government agent and one  of those responsible for the recent arrest of Poles.  Bakunin, of course, repudiated the charge, and  George Sand wrote to the ``Neue Rheinische  Zeitung,'' denying this statement in toto. The denials  were published by Marx, and there was a nominal  reconciliation, but from this time onward there was  never any real abatement of the hostility between  these rival leaders, who did not meet again until 1864.    Meanwhile, the reaction had been everywhere  gaining ground. In May, 1849, an insurrection in  Dresden for a moment made the revolutionaries masters  of the town. They held it for five days and  established a revolutionary government. Bakunin  was the soul of the defense which they made against  the Prussian troops. But they were overpowered,  and at last Bakunin was captured while trying to  escape with Heubner and Richard Wagner, the last  of whom, fortunately for music, was not captured.    Now began a long period of imprisonment in  many prisons and various countries. Bakunin was  sentenced to death on the 14th of January, 1850, but  his sentence was commuted after five months, and he  was delivered over to Austria, which claimed the  privilege of punishing him. The Austrians, in their  turn, condemned him to death in May, 1851, and  again his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for  life. In the Austrian prisons he had fetters on hands  and feet, and in one of them he was even chained to the  wall by the belt. There seems to have been some  peculiar pleasure to be derived from the punishment  of Bakunin, for the Russian Government in its turn  demanded him of the Austrians, who delivered him  up. In Russia he was confined, first in the Peter and  Paul fortress and then in the Schluesselburg. There  be suffered from scurvy and all his teeth fell out.  His health gave way completely, and he found almost  all food impossible to assimilate. ``But, if his body  became enfeebled, his spirit remained inflexible. He  feared one thing above all. It was to find himself  some day led, by the debilitating action of prison,  to the condition of degradation of which Silvio Pellico  offers a well-known type. He feared that he might  cease to hate, that he might feel the sentiment of  revolt which upheld him becoming extinguished in  his hearts that he might come to pardon his persecutors  and resign himself to his fate. But this fear  was superfluous; his energy did not abandon him a  single day, and he emerged from his cell the same  man as when he entered.''[14]      [14] Ibid. p. xxvi.      After the death of the Tsar Nicholas many political  prisoners were amnested, but Alexander II with  his own hand erased Bakunin's name from the list.  When Bakunin's mother succeeded in obtaining an  interview with the new Tsar, he said to her, ``Know,  Madame, that so long as your son lives, he can never  be free.'' However, in 1857, after eight years of  captivity, he was sent to the comparative freedom of  Siberia. From there, in 1861, he succeeded in escaping  to Japan, and thence through America to London.  He had been imprisoned for his hostility to  governments, but, strange to say, his sufferings had  not had the intended effect of making him love those  who inflicted them. From this time onward, he  devoted himself to spreading the spirit of Anarchist  revolt, without, however, having to suffer any further  term of imprisonment. For some years he lived in  Italy, where he founded in 1864 an ``International  Fraternity'' or ``Alliance of Socialist Revolutionaries.''  This contained men of many countries, but  apparently no Germans. It devoted itself largely to  combating Mazzini's nationalism. In 1867 he moved  to Switzerland, where in the following year he  helped to found the ``International Alliance of So-  cialist Democracy,'' of which he drew up the program.  This program gives a good succinct resume of  his opinions:--      The Alliance declares itself atheist; it desires the  definitive and entire abolition of classes and the political  equality and social equalization of individuals of both  sexes. It desires that the earth, the instrument of labor,  like all other capital, becoming the collective property of  society as a whole, shall be no longer able to be utilized  except by the workers, that is to say, by agricultural and  industrial associations. It recognizes that all actually  existing political and authoritarian States, reducing  themselves more and more to the mere administrative functions  of the public services in their respective countries,  must disappear in the universal union of free  associations, both agricultural and industrial.      The International Alliance of Socialist Democracy  desired to become a branch of the International  Working Men's Association, but was refused admission  on the ground that branches must be local, and  could not themselves be international. The Geneva  group of the Alliance, however, was admitted later,  in July, 1869.    The International Working Men's Association  had been founded in London in 1864, and its statutes  and program were drawn up by Marx. Bakunin at  first did not expect it to prove a success and refused  to join it. But it spread with remarkable rapidity  in many countries and soon became a great power  for the"]]]
