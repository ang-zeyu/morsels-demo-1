[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/584"],[0,"Our Nig; Or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, in a Two-story White House, (#8)"],[1," enjoyment, Jack arrived unexpectedly. His greeting was  as hearty to herself as to any of the family.    \"Where are your curls, Fra?\" asked Jack, after the usual salutation.    \"Your mother cut them off.\"    \"Thought you were getting handsome, did she? Same old story, is it;  knocks and bumps? Better times coming; never fear, Nig.\"    How different this appellative sounded from him; he said it in such a  tone, with such a rogueish look!    She laughed, and replied that he had better take her West for a  housekeeper.    Jack was pleased with James's innovations of table discipline, and would  often tarry in the dining-room, to see Nig in her new place at the  family table. As he was thus sitting one day, after the family had  finished dinner, Frado seated herself in her mistress' chair, and was  just reaching for a clean dessert plate which was on the table, when her  mistress entered.    \"Put that plate down; you shall not have a clean one; eat from mine,\"  continued she. Nig hesitated. To eat after James, his wife or Jack,  would have been pleasant; but to be commanded to do what was  disagreeable by her mistress, BECAUSE it was disagreeable, was trying.  Quickly looking about, she took the plate, called Fido to wash it, which  he did to the best of his ability; then, wiping her knife and fork on  the cloth, she proceeded to eat her dinner.    Nig never looked toward her mistress during the process. She had Jack  near; she did not fear her now.    Insulted, full of rage, Mrs. Bellmont rushed to her husband, and  commanded him to notice this insult; to whip that child; if he would not  do it, James ought.    James came to hear the kitchen version of the affair. Jack was boiling  over with laughter. He related all the circumstances to James, and  pulling a bright, silver half-dollar from his pocket, he threw it at  Nig, saying, \"There, take that; 'twas worth paying for.\"    James sought his mother; told her he \"would not excuse or palliate Nig's  impudence; but she should not be whipped or be punished at all. You have  not treated her, mother, so as to gain her love; she is only exhibiting  your remissness in this matter.\"    She only smothered her resentment until a convenient opportunity  offered. The first time she was left alone with Nig, she gave her a  thorough beating, to bring up arrearages; and threatened, if she ever  exposed her to James, she would \"cut her tongue out.\"    James found her, upon his return, sobbing; but fearful of revenge, she  dared not answer his queries. He guessed their cause, and longed for  returning health to take her under his protection.          CHAPTER VII.    SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF NIG.        \"What are our joys but dreams? and what our hopes      But goodly shadows in the summer cloud?\"        H. K. W.      JAMES did not improve as was hoped. Month after month passed away, and  brought no prospect of returning health. He could not walk far from the  house for want of strength; but he loved to sit with Aunt Abby in her  quiet room, talking of unseen glories, and heart-experiences, while  planning for the spiritual benefit of those around them. In these  confidential interviews, Frado was never omitted. They would discuss the  prevalent opinion of the public, that people of color are really  inferior; incapable of cultivation and refinement. They would glance at  the qualities of Nig, which promised so much if rightly directed. \"I  wish you would take her, James, when you are well, home with YOU,\" said  Aunt Abby, in one of these seasons.    \"Just what I am longing to do, Aunt Abby. Susan is just of my mind, and  we intend to take her; I have been wishing to do so for years.\"    \"She seems much affected by what she hears at the evening meetings, and  asks me many questions on serious things; seems to love to read the  Bible; I feel hopes of her.\"    \"I hope she IS thoughtful; no one has a kinder heart, one capable of  loving more devotedly. But to think how prejudiced the world are towards  her people; that she must be reared in such ignorance as to drown all  the finer feelings. When I think of what she might be, of what she will  be, I feel like grasping time till opinions change, and thousands like  her rise into a noble freedom. I have seen Frado's grief, because she is  black, amount to agony. It makes me sick to recall these scenes. Mother  pretends to think she don't know enough to sorrow for anything; but if  she could see her as I have, when she supposed herself entirely alone,  except her little dog Fido, lamenting her loneliness and complexion, I  think, if she is not past feeling, she would retract. In the summer I  was walking near the barn, and as I stood I heard sobs. 'Oh! oh!' I  heard, 'why was I made? why can't I die? Oh, what have I to live for? No  one cares for me only to get my work. And I feel sick; who cares for  that? Work as long as I can stand, and then fall down and lay there till  I can get up. No mother, father, brother or sister to care for me, and  then it is, You lazy nigger, lazy nigger--all because I am black! Oh, if  I could die!'    \"I stepped into the barn, where I could see her. She was crouched down  by the hay with her faithful friend Fido, and as she ceased speaking,  buried her face in her hands, and cried bitterly; then, patting Fido,  she kissed him, saying, 'You love me, Fido, don't you? but we must go  work in the field.' She started on her mission; I called her to me, and  told her she need not go, the hay was doing well.    \"She has such confidence in me that she will do just as I tell her; so  we found a seat under a shady tree, and there I took the opportunity to  combat the notions she seemed to entertain respecting the loneliness of  her condition and want of sympathizing friends. I assured her that  mother's views were by no means general; that in our part of the country  there were thousands upon thousands who favored the elevation of her  race, disapproving of oppression in all its forms; that she was not  unpitied, friendless, and utterly despised; that she might hope for  better things in the future. Having spoken these words of comfort, I  rose with the resolution that if I recovered my health I would take her  home with me, whether mother was willing or not.\"    \"I don't know what your mother would do without her; still, I wish she  was away.\"    Susan now came for her long absent husband, and they returned home to  their room.    The month of November was one of great anxiety on James's account. He  was rapidly wasting away.    A celebrated physician was called, and performed a surgical operation,  as a last means. Should this fail, there was no hope. Of course he was  confined wholly to his room, mostly to his bed. With all his bodily  suffering, all his anxiety for his family, whom he might not live to  protect, he did not forget Frado. He shielded her from many beatings,  and every day imparted religious instructions. No one, but his wife,  could move him so easily as Frado; so that in addition to her daily toil  she was often deprived of her rest at night.    Yet she insisted on being called; she wished to show her love for one  who had been such a friend to her. Her anxiety and grief increased as  the probabilities of his recovery became doubtful.    Mrs. Bellmont found her weeping on his account, shut her up, and whipped  her with the raw-hide, adding an injunction never to be seen snivelling  again because she had a little work to do. She was very careful never to  shed tears on his account, in her presence, afterwards.          CHAPTER VIII.    VISITOR AND DEPARTURE.    --\"Other cares engross me, and my tired soul with emulative haste, Looks  to its God.\"      THE brother associated with James in business, in Baltimore, was sent  for to confer with one who might never be able to see him there.    James began to speak of life as closing; of heaven, as of a place in  immediate prospect; of aspirations, which waited for fruition in glory.  His brother, Lewis by name, was an especial favorite of sister Mary;  more like her, in disposition and preferences than James or Jack.    He arrived as soon as possible after the request, and saw with regret  the sure indications of fatality in his sick brother, and listened to  his admonitions--admonitions to a Christian life--with tears, and  uttered some promises of attention to the subject so dear to the heart  of James.    How gladly he would have extended healing aid. But, alas! it was not in  his power; so, after listening to his wishes and arrangements for his  family and business, he decided to return home.    Anxious for company home, he persuaded his father and mother to permit  Mary to attend him. She was not at all needed in the sick room; she did  not choose to be useful in the kitchen, and then she was fully  determined to go.    So all the trunks were assembled and crammed with the best selections  from the wardrobe of herself and mother, where the last-mentioned  articles could be appropriated.    \"Nig was never so helpful before,\" Mary remarked, and wondered what had  induced such a change in place of former sullenness.    Nig was looking further than the present, and congratulating herself  upon some days of peace, for Mary never lost opportunity of informing  her mother of Nig's delinquencies, were she otherwise ignorant.    Was it strange if she were officious, with such relief in prospect?    The parting from the sick brother was tearful and sad. James prayed in  their presence for their renewal in holiness; and urged their immediate  attention to eternal realities, and gained a promise that Susan and  Charlie should share their kindest regards.    No sooner were they on their way, than Nig slyly crept round to Aunt  Abby's room, and tiptoeing and twisting herself into all shapes, she  exclaimed,--    \"She's gone, Aunt Abby, she's gone, fairly gone;\" and jumped up and  down, till Aunt Abby feared she would attract the notice of her mistress  by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5844"],[0,"The Adventures of Johnny Chuck (#8)"],[1,"is because you think yourself so smart to hide yourself up  here in the old orchard, let me tell you that I found you out long ago,  and so did Reddy Fox, and Bowser the Hound, and Farmer Brown's boy,\"  sneered Sammy Jay in the most disagreeable way.    \"It isn't that,\" said Johnny Chuck.    \"Well, what is it, then?\" snapped Sammy Jay.    \"That's for you to find out,\" replied Johnny Chuck.       \"There's foolish pride and silly pride and pride of low degree;     A better pride is honest pride, and that's the pride for me.\"    And with that, Johnny Chuck disappeared in his new house.          XX. SAMMY JAY UNDERSTANDS      It was a beautiful morning. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had thrown his  bedclothes off very early and started to climb up the sky, smiling his  broadest. Old Mother West Wind had swept his path clear of clouds. The  Merry Little Breezes, who, you know, are Mother West Wind's children,  had danced across the Green Meadows up to the old orchard, where they  pelted each other with white and pink petals of apple blossoms until  the ground was covered. Each apple-tree was like a huge bouquet of  loveliness. Yes, indeed, it was very beautiful that spring morning.    Sammy Jay had gotten up almost as early as Mr. Sun and Old Mother West  Wind. As soon as he had swallowed his breakfast, he flew up to the old  orchard and hid among the white and pink apple blossoms to watch for  Johnny Chuck. You see, he knew that Johnny Chuck had some sort of a  secret which filled Johnny with very great pride; but what it was Sammy  Jay couldn't even guess, and nothing troubles Sammy Jay quite so much as  the feeling that he cannot find out the secrets of other people. So he  sat very, very still among the apple blossoms and waited and watched.    By and by Johnny Chuck appeared on his doorstep. He seemed very much  excited, did Johnny Chuck. He sat up very straight and looked this way  and looked that way. He looked up in the apple-trees, and Sammy Jay held  his breath, for fear that Johnny would see him. But Sammy was so well  hidden that, bright as Johnny Chuck's eyes are, they failed to see him.  Then Johnny Chuck actually climbed up on the old stone wall so as to see  better, and he sat there a long time, looking and looking.    Sammy Jay grew impatient. \"He seems to be terribly watchful this  morning. I never knew him to be so watchful before. I don't understand  it,\" muttered Sammy to himself.    After a while Johnny Chuck seemed quite satisfied that there was no one  about. He hopped down from the old stone wall and scampered over to  the doorway of his new house, and there he began to chatter. Sammy Jay  stretched his neck until it ached, trying to hear what Johnny Chuck was  saying, but he couldn't because Johnny's head was inside his doorway.    Pretty soon Johnny Chuck backed out and sat up, and he looked very proud  and important. Then Sammy Jay saw something that nearly took his breath  away. It was the head of Polly Chuck peeping out of the doorway. It was  the first time that he had seen Polly Chuck.    \"Why,\" gasped Sammy Jay, \"it must be that Johnny Chuck has a mate, and I  didn't know a thing about it! So that's his secret and the reason he has  appeared so proud lately!\"    Polly Chuck came out on the doorstep. She looked just as proud as Johnny  Chuck, and at the same time she seemed terribly anxious. She sat up  beside Johnny Chuck, and she looked this way and that way, just as  Johnny had. Then she put her head in at the doorway and began to call in  the softest voice.    In a minute Sammy Jay saw something more. It surprised him so that he  nearly lost his balance. It was another head peeping out of the doorway,  a head just like Johnny Chuck's, only it was a teeny-weeny one. Then  there was another and another! Polly kept talking and talking in the  softest voice, while Johnny Chuck swelled himself up until he looked as  if he would burst with pride.    Sammy Jay understood now why Johnny Chuck had been so proud for the last  few days. It was because he had a family! Sammy looked down at the three  little Chucks sitting on the doorstep, trying to sit up the way Johnny  Chuck sat, and they looked so funny that Sammy forgot himself and  laughed right out loud. In a flash the three little Chucks and Polly  Chuck had disappeared inside the house, while Johnny Chuck looked up  angrily. He knew that his secret was a secret no longer.          XXI. SAMMY JAY HAS A CHANGE OF HEART           There's no one ever quite so bad       That somewhere way down deep inside       A little goodness does not find       A place wherein to creep and hide.    It is so with Sammy Jay. Yes, Sir, it is so with Sammy Jay. You may  think that because Sammy Jay is vain, a trouble-maker and a thief, he  is all bad. He isn't. There is some good in Sammy Jay, just as there is  some good in everybody. If there wasn't, Old Mother Nature never,  never would allow Sammy Jay to go his mischievous way through the Green  Forest. He dearly loves to get other people into all kinds of trouble,  and this is one reason why nobody loves him. But if you watch out sharp  enough, you will find that hidden under that beautiful blue and white  coat of his there really is some good. You may have to look a long time  for it, but sooner or later you will find it. Johnny Chuck did.    Sammy Jay had already made a lot of trouble for Johnny Chuck. You see he  had been the first of the little forest and meadow people to find Johnny  Chuck's new house. And then, just to make trouble for Johnny Chuck, he  had told Reddy Fox about it, and after that he had called Bowser the  Hound and Farmer Brown's boy over to it. Now he had discovered Johnny  Chuck's greatest secret--that Johnny had a family. What a chance to make  trouble now!    Sammy started for the Green Forest as fast as his wings could take him.  He would tell Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk. They were very fond of  young Chucks. It would be great fun to see the fright of Johnny Chuck  and his family when Reddy Fox or Redtail the Hawk appeared.    Sammy Jay chuckled wickedly as he flew. When he reached the Green  Forest and stopped in his favorite hemlock-tree to rest, he was still  chuckling. But by that time it was a different kind of a chuckle. Yes,  Sir, it was a different kind of a chuckle. It was a better chuckle to  hear. The fact is, Sammy Jay was no longer chuckling over the thought  of the trouble he could make. He was laughing at the memory of how funny  those three little baby Chucks had looked sitting up on Johnny Chuck's  doorstep and trying to do whatever Johnny Chuck did. The more he thought  about it, the more he tickled and laughed.    Right in the midst of his laughter along came Redtail the Hawk. Sammy  Jay opened his mouth to call to Redtail and tell him about Johnny  Chuck's secret. Then he closed it again with a snap.    \"I won't tell him yet,\" said Sammy to himself, \"for he might catch one  of those baby Chucks, and they are such funny little fellows that that  would really be too bad. I guess I'll wait a while.\" And with that, off  flew Sammy Jay to hunt for some other mischief. You see, he had had a  change of heart. The little goodness way down deep inside had come out  of hiding.    But of course Johnny Chuck didn't know this, and over in his new house  in the far corner of the old orchard, he and Polly Chuck were worrying  and worrying, for they felt sure that now every one would know their  secret, and it wouldn't be safe for the dear little baby Chucks to so  much as put their funny little noses outside the door.          XXII. JOHNNY CHUCK IS KEPT BUSY      Johnny Chuck is naturally lazy. You see, Johnny has very simple tastes  and usually he is contented. He does not have to go far from his own  doorstep to get all he wants to eat. He does not have to hunt for his  food, as so many of the little meadow and forest people do, and so he  has a great deal of time to sit on his doorstep and watch the world go  by and dream pleasant daydreams and grow fat. Now people who do not have  to work usually become lazy. It is the easiest habit in the world to  learn and the hardest to get over. And so, because he seldom has to  work, Johnny Chuck quite naturally is lazy.    But Johnny can work when there really is need of it. No one, unless  it is Digger the Badger or Miner the Mole, can dig faster than Johnny  Chuck. And when there is real need of working, Johnny works with a will.  When he was a very tiny Chuck, old Mother Chuck had taught him this:        \"When work there is that must be done       Don't fret and whine and spoil the day!       The quicker that you do your work       The longer time you'll have to play.\"    Johnny never has forgotten this, and when it is really necessary that he  should work, no one works harder than he does. But he always first makes  sure that it is necessary work and that he will not be wasting his time  in doing foolish, unnecessary things.    And now Johnny Chuck was the busiest he had ever been in all his life.  If he felt lazy these beautiful spring days, he didn't have time to  think about it. No, Sir, he actually didn't have time to remember that  he is naturally lazy. You see, he had a family to look out for--three  babies to find sweet, tender young clover for and to teach all the  things that every Chuck should know, and to watch out for, that no harm  should come to them. So Johnny Chuck was busy, so busy that he hardly  had time to get enough to eat.    Every morning Johnny would come out as soon as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun  began his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. He would look this way  and look that way to make sure that Reddy Fox or Granny Fox or Redtail  the Hawk or Bowser the Hound or any other danger was nowhere near. And  he never forgot to look up in the apple-trees to make sure that Sammy  Jay was not there. Then he would call to Polly Chuck and the three baby  Chucks.    Polly Chuck would come out with a"]]]
