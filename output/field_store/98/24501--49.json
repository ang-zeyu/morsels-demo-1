A filament was fixed to  the upright basal part, higher up than before, close beneath the lowest  scale-like process or homologue of a leaf; and its movement was traced  [page 33]  during 38 h. (Fig. 23). We here again have plain evidence of continued  circumnutation. Had the bean been properly planted, the part of the  epicotyl to which the filament was attached, the    Fig. 23. Vicia faba: circumnutation of the same epicotyl as in Fig. 22, a  little more advanced in age, traced under similar conditions as before,  from 8.40 A.M. Dec. 28th, to 10.50 A.M. 30th. Movement of bead here  magnified 20 times.    movement of which is here shown, would probably have just risen above the  surface of the ground.    Lathyrus nissolia (Leguminosae).--This plant was selected for observation  from being an abnormal form with grass-like leaves.    Fig. 24. Lathyrus nissolia: circumnutation of stem of young seedling,  traced in darkness on a horizontal glass, from 6.45 A.M. Nov. 22nd, to 7  A.M. 23rd. Movement of end of leaf magnified about 12 times, here reduced  to one-half of original scale.    The cotyledons are hypogean, and the epicotyl breaks through the ground in  an arched form. The movements of a stem, 1.2 inch in height, consisting of  three internodes, the lower one almost wholly subterranean, and the upper  one bearing a short,  [page 34]  narrow leaf, is shown during 24 h., in Fig. 24. No glass filament was  employed, but a mark was placed beneath the apex of the leaf. The actual  length of the longer of the two ellipses described by the stem was about  .14 of an inch. On the previous day the chief line of movement was nearly  at right angles to that shown in the present figure, and it was more  simple.    Cassia tora* (Leguminosae).--A seedling was placed before a    Fig. 25. Cassia tora: conjoint circumnutation of cotyledons and hypocotyl,  traced on vertical glass, from 7.10 A.M. Sept. 25th to 7.30 A.M. 26th.  Figure here given reduced to one-half of original scale.    * Seeds of this plant, which grew near the sea-side, were sent to us by  Fritz Müller from S. Brazil. The seedlings did not flourish or flower well  with us; they were sent to Kew, and were pronounced not to be  distinguishable from C. tora.  [page 35]    north-east window; it bent very little towards it, as the hypocotyl which  was left free was rather old, and therefore not highly heliotropic. A  filament had been fixed to the midrib of one of the cotyledons, and the  movement of the whole seedling was traced during two days. The  circumnutation of the hypocotyl is quite insignificant compared with that  of the cotyledons. These rise up vertically at night and come into close  contact; so that they may be said to sleep. This seedling was so old that a  very small true leaf had been developed, which at night was completely  hidden by the closed cotyledons. On Sept. 24th, between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M.,  the cotyledons moved five times up and five times down; they therefore  described five irregular ellipses in the course of the 9 h. The great  nocturnal rise commenced about 4.30 P.M.    On the following morning (Sept. 25th) the movement of the same cotyledon  was again traced in the same manner during 24 h.; and a copy of the tracing  is here given (Fig. 25). The morning was cold, and the window had been  accidentally left open for a short time, which must have chilled the plant;  and this probably prevented it from moving quite as freely as on the  previous day; for it rose only four and sank only four times during the  day, one of the oscillations being very small. At 7.10 A.M., when the first  dot was made, the cotyledons were not fully open or awake; they continued  to open till about 9 A.M., by which time they had sunk a little beneath the  horizon: by 9.30 A.M. they had risen, and then they oscillated up and down;  but the upward and downward lines never quite coincided. At about 4.30 P.M.  the great nocturnal rise commenced. At 7 A.M. on the following morning  (Sept. 26th) they occupied nearly the same level as on the previous  morning, as shown in the diagram: they then began to open or sink in the  usual manner. The diagram leads to the belief that the great periodical  daily rise and fall does not differ essentially, excepting in amplitude,  from the oscillations during the middle of the day.    Lotus Jacoboeus (Leguminosae).--The cotyledons of this plant, after the few  first days of their life, rise so as to stand almost, though rarely quite,  vertically at night. They continue to act in this manner for a long time  even after the development of some of the true leaves. With seedlings, 3  inches in height, and bearing five or six leaves, they rose at night about  45o. They continued to act thus for about an additional fortnight.  Subsequently they remained horizontal at night, though still green  [page 36]  and at last dropped off. Their rising at night so as to stand almost  vertically appears to depend largely on temperature; for when the seedlings  were kept in a cool house, though they still continued to grow, the  cotyledons did not become vertical at night. It is remarkable that the  cotyledons do not generally rise at night to any conspicuous extent during  the first four or five days after germination; but the period was extremely  variable with seedlings kept under the same conditions; and many were  observed. Glass filaments with minute triangles of paper were fixed to the  cotyledons (1 ½ mm. in breadth) of two seedlings, only 24 h. old, and the  hypocotyl was secured to a stick; their movements greatly magnified were  traced, and they certainly circumnutated the whole time on a small scale,  but they did not exhibit any distinct nocturnal and diurnal movement. The  hypocotyls, when left free, circumnutated over a large space.    Another and much older seedling, bearing a half-developed leaf, had its  movements traced in a similar manner during the three first days and nights  of June; but seedlings at this age appear to be very sensitive to a  deficiency of light; they were observed under a rather dim skylight, at a  temperature of between 16o to 17 1/2o C.' and apparently, in consequence of  these conditions, the great daily movement of the cotyledons ceased on the  third day. During the first two days they began rising in the early  afternoon in a nearly straight line, until between 6 and 7 P.M., when they  stood vertically. During the latter part of the night, or more probably in  the early morning, they began to fall or open, so that by 6.45 A.M. they  stood fully expanded and horizontal. They continued to fall slowly for some  time, and during the second day described a single small ellipse, between 9  A.M. and 2 P.M., in addition to the great diurnal movement. The course  pursued during the whole 24 h. was far less complex than in the foregoing  case of Cassia. On the third morning they fell very much, and then  circumnutated on a small scale round the same spot; by 8.20 P.M. they  showed no tendency to rise at night. Nor did the cotyledons of any of the  many other seedlings in the same pot rise; and so it was on the following  night of June 5th. The pot was then taken back into the hot-house, where it  was exposed to the sun, and on the succeeding night all the cotyledons rose  again to a high angle, but did not stand quite vertically. On each of the  above days the line representing the great nocturnal  [page 37]  rise did not coincide with that of the great diurnal fall, so that narrow  ellipses were described, as is the usual rule with circumnutating organs.  The cotyledons are provided with a pulvinus, and its development will  hereafter be described.    Mimosa pudica (Leguminosae).--The cotyledons rise up vertically at night,  so as to close together. Two seedlings were observed in the greenhouse  (temp. 16o to 17o C. or 63o to 65o F.). Their hypocotyls were secured to  sticks, and glass filaments bearing little triangles of paper were affixed  to the cotyledons of both. Their movements were traced on a vertical glass  during 24 h. on November 13th. The pot had stood for some time in the same  position, and they were chiefly illuminated through the glass-roof. The  cotyledons of one of these seedlings moved downward in the morning till  11.30 A.M., and then rose, moving rapidly in the evening until they stood  vertically, so that in this case there was simply a single great daily fall  and rise. The other seedling behaved rather differently, for it fell in the  morning until 11.30 A.M., and then rose, but after 12.10 P.M. again fell;  and the great evening rise did not begin until 1.22 P.M. On the following  morning this cotyledon had fallen greatly from its vertical position by  8.15 A.M. Two other seedlings (one seven and the other eight days old) had  been previously observed under unfavourable circumstances, for they had  been brought into a room and placed before a north-east window, where the  temperature was between only 56o and 57o F. They had, moreover, to be  protected from lateral light, and perhaps were not sufficiently  illuminated. Under these circumstances the cotyledons moved simply  downwards from 7 A.M. till 2 P.M., after which hour and during a large part  of the night they continued to rise. Between 7 and 8 A.M. on the following  morning they fell again; but on this second and likewise on the third day  the movements became irregular, and between 3 and 10.30 P.M. they  circumnutated to a small extent about the same spot; but they did not rise  at night. Nevertheless, on the following night they rose as usual.    Cytisus fragrans (Leguminosae).--Only a few observations were made on this  plant. The hypocotyl circumnutated to a considerable extent, but in a  simple manner--namely, for two hours in one direction, and then much more  slowly back again in a zigzag course, almost parallel to the first line,  and beyond the starting-point. It moved in the same direction all night,  but next"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5625"],[0,"Flint and Feather: Collected Verse (#8)"],[1,"eyes.    No sound awakes; I, even, breathe no sigh,  Nor hear a single footstep passing by;  Yet I am not alone, for now I feel              A presence steal    Within my chamber walls; I turn to see  The sweetest guest that courts humanity;  With subtle, slow enchantment draws she near,              And Sleep is here.    What care I for the olive branch of Peace?  Kind Sleep will bring a thrice-distilled release,  Nepenthes, that alone her mystic hand              Can understand.    And so she bends, this welcome sorceress,  To crown my fasting with her light caress.  Ah, sure my pain will vanish at the bliss              Of her warm kiss.    But still my duty lies in self-denial;  I must refuse sweet Sleep, although the trial  Will reawaken all my depth of pain.              So once again    I lift the curtain with a weary hand,  With more than sorrow, silently I stand,  Look out while darkness overspreads the way,              And long for day.    \"Go, Sleep,\" I say, \"before the darkness die,  To one who needs you even more than I,  For I can bear my part alone, but he              Has need of thee.    \"His poor tired eyes in vain have sought relief,  His heart more tired still, with all its grief;  His pain is deep, while mine is vague and dim,              Go thou to him.    \"When thou hast fanned him with thy drowsy wings,  And laid thy lips upon the pulsing strings  That in his soul with fret and fever burn,              To me return.\"    She goes. The air within the quiet street  Reverberates to the passing of her feet;  I watch her take her passage through the gloom              To your dear home.    Beloved, would you knew how sweet to me  Is this denial, and how fervently  I pray that Sleep may lift you to her breast,             And give you rest--    A privilege that she alone can claim.  Would that my heart could comfort you the same,  But in the censer Sleep is swinging high,             All sorrows die.    She comes not back, yet all my miseries  Wane at the thought of your calm sleeping eyes--  Wane, as I hear the early matin bell             The dawn foretell.    And so, dear heart, still silently I stand,  Uplift the curtain with a weary hand,  The long, long night has bitter been and lone,              But now 'tis gone.    Dawn lights her candles in the East once more,  And darkness flees her chariot before;  The Lenten morning breaks with holy ray,              And it is day!        CHRISTMASTIDE      I may not go to-night to Bethlehem,  Nor follow star-directed ways, nor tread  The paths wherein the shepherds walked, that led  To Christ, and peace, and God's good will to men.    I may not hear the Herald Angel's song  Peal through the Oriental skies, nor see  The wonder of that Heavenly company  Announce the King the world had waited long.    The manger throne I may not kneel before,  Or see how man to God is reconciled,  Through pure St. Mary's purer, holier child;  The human Christ these eyes may not adore.    I may not carry frankincense and myrrh  With adoration to the Holy One;  Nor gold have I to give the Perfect Son,  To be with those wise kings a worshipper.    Not mine the joy that Heaven sent to them,  For ages since Time swung and locked his gates,  But I may kneel without--the star still waits  To guide me on to holy Bethlehem.        CLOSE BY      So near at hand (our eyes o'erlooked its nearness  In search of distant things)  A dear dream lay--perchance to grow in dearness  Had we but felt its wings  Astir. The air our very breathing fanned  It was so near at hand.    Once, many days ago, we almost held it,  The love we so desired;  But our shut eyes saw not, and fate dispelled it  Before our pulses fired  To flame, and errant fortune bade us stand  Hand almost touching hand.    I sometimes think had we two been discerning,  The by-path hid away  From others' eyes had then revealed its turning  To us, nor led astray  Our footsteps, guiding us into love's land  That lay so near at hand.    So near at hand, dear heart, could we have known it!  Throughout those dreamy hours,  Had either loved, or loving had we shown it,  Response had sure been ours;  We did not know that heart could heart command,  And love so near at hand!    What then availed the red wine's subtle glisten?  We passed it blindly by,  And now what profit that we wait and listen  Each for the other's heart beat? Ah! the cry  Of love o'erlooked still lingers, you and I  Sought heaven afar, we did not understand  'Twas--once so near at hand.        THE IDLERS      The sun's red pulses beat,  Full prodigal of heat,  Full lavish of its lustre unrepressed;  But we have drifted far  From where his kisses are,  And in this landward-lying shade we let our paddles rest.    The river, deep and still,  The maple-mantled hill,  The little yellow beach whereon we lie,  The puffs of heated breeze,  All sweetly whisper--These  Are days that only come in a Canadian July.    So, silently we two  Lounge in our still canoe,  Nor fate, nor fortune matters to us now:  So long as we alone  May call this dream our own,  The breeze may die, the sail may droop, we care not when or how.    Against the thwart, near by,  Inactively you lie,  And all too near my arm your temple bends.  Your indolently crude,  Abandoned attitude,  Is one of ease and art, in which a perfect languor blends.    Your costume, loose and light,  Leaves unconcealed your might  Of muscle, half suspected, half defined;  And falling well aside,  Your vesture opens wide,  Above your splendid sunburnt throat that pulses unconfined.    With easy unreserve,  Across the gunwale's curve,  Your arm superb is lying, brown and bare;  Your hand just touches mine  With import firm and fine,  (I kiss the very wind that blows about your tumbled hair).    Ah! Dear, I am unwise  In echoing your eyes  Whene'er they leave their far-off gaze, and turn  To melt and blur my sight;  For every other light  Is servile to your cloud-grey eyes, wherein cloud shadows burn.    But once the silence breaks,  But once your ardour wakes  To words that humanize this lotus-land;  So perfect and complete  Those burning words and sweet,  So perfect is the single kiss your lips lay on my hand.    The paddles lie disused,  The fitful breeze abused,  Has dropped to slumber, with no after-blow;  And hearts will pay the cost,  For you and I have lost  More than the homeward blowing wind that died an hour ago.        AT SUNSET      To-night the west o'er-brims with warmest dyes;  Its chalice overflows  With pools of purple colouring the skies,  Aflood with gold and rose;  And some hot soul seems throbbing close to mine,  As sinks the sun within that world of wine.    I seem to hear a bar of music float  And swoon into the west;  My ear can scarcely catch the whispered note,  But something in my breast  Blends with that strain, till both accord in one,  As cloud and colour blend at set of sun.    And twilight comes with grey and restful eyes,  As ashes follow flame.  But O! I heard a voice from those rich skies  Call tenderly my name;  It was as if some priestly fingers stole  In benedictions o'er my lonely soul.    I know not why, but all my being longed  And leapt at that sweet call;  My heart outreached its arms, all passion thronged  And beat against Fate's wall,  Crying in utter homesickness to be  Near to a heart that loves and leans to me.        PENSEROSO      Soulless is all humanity to me  To-night. My keenest longing is to be  Alone, alone with God's grey earth that seems  Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.    To-night my soul desires no fellowship,  Or fellow-being; crave I but to slip  Thro' space on space, till flesh no more can bind,  And I may quit for aye my fellow kind.    Let me but feel athwart my cheek the lash  Of whipping wind, but hear the torrent dash  Adown the mountain steep, 'twere more my choice  Than touch of human hand, than human voice.    Let me but wander on the shore night-stilled,  Drinking its darkness till my soul is filled;  The breathing of the salt sea on my hair,  My outstretched hands but grasping empty air.    Let me but feel the pulse of Nature's soul  Athrob on mine, let seas and thunders roll  O'er night and me; sands whirl; winds, waters beat;  For God's grey earth has no cheap counterfeit.        RE-VOYAGE      What of the days when we two dreamed together?    Days marvellously fair,  As lightsome as a skyward floating feather    Sailing on summer air--  Summer, summer, that came drifting through  Fate's hand to me, to you.    What of the days, my dear? I sometimes wonder    If you too wish this sky  Could be the blue we sailed so softly under,    In that sun-kissed July;  Sailed in the warm and yellow afternoon,  With hearts in touch and tune.    Have you no longing to re-live the dreaming,    Adrift in my canoe?  To watch my paddle blade all wet and gleaming    Cleaving the waters through?  To lie wind-blown and wave-caressed, until  Your restless pulse grows still?    Do you not long to listen to the purling    Of foam athwart the keel?  To hear the nearing rapids softly swirling    Among their stones, to feel  The boat's unsteady tremor as it braves  The wild and snarling waves?    What need of question, what of your replying?    Oh! well I know that you  Would toss the world away to be but lying    Again in my canoe,  In listless indolence entranced and lost,  Wave-rocked, and passion tossed.    Ah me! my paddle failed me in the steering    Across love's shoreless seas;  All reckless, I had ne'er a thought of fearing    Such dreary days as these,  When through the self-same rapids we dash by,  My lone canoe and I.        BRIER      GOOD FRIDAY    Because, dear Christ, your tender, wounded arm    Bends back the brier that edges life's long way,  That no hurt comes to heart, to soul no harm,    I do not feel the thorns so much to-day.    Because I never knew your care to tire,    Your hand to weary guiding me aright,  Because you walk"]]]
