'Where do they get the feathers?' thought  Curdie; but in a moment the troop disappeared at a turn of the way, and  it was now both safe and necessary for Curdie to follow them, lest they  should be round the next turning before he saw them again, for so he  might lose them altogether.  He darted after them like a greyhound.  When he reached the corner and looked cautiously round, he saw them  again at some distance down another long passage.  None of the  galleries he saw that night bore signs of the work of man--or of goblin  either.  Stalactites, far older than the mines, hung from their roofs;  and their floors were rough with boulders and large round stones,  showing that there water must have once run.  He waited again at this  corner till they had disappeared round the next, and so followed them a  long way through one passage after another.  The passages grew more and  more lofty, and were more and more covered in the roof with shining  stalactites.    It was a strange enough procession which he followed.  But the  strangest part of it was the household animals which crowded amongst  the feet of the goblins.  It was true they had no wild animals down  there--at least they did not know of any; but they had a wonderful  number of tame ones.  I must, however, reserve any contributions  towards the natural history of these for a later position in my story.    At length, turning a corner too abruptly, he had almost rushed into the  middle of the goblin family; for there they had already set down all  their burdens on the floor of a cave considerably larger than that  which they had left.  They were as yet too breathless to speak, else he  would have had warning of their arrest.  He started back, however,  before anyone saw him, and retreating a good way, stood watching till  the father should come out to go to the palace.    Before very long, both he and his son Helfer appeared and kept on in  the same direction as before, while Curdie followed them again with  renewed precaution.  For a long time he heard no sound except something  like the rush of a river inside the rock; but at length what seemed the  far-off noise of a great shouting reached his ears, which, however,  presently ceased.  After advancing a good way farther, he thought he  heard a single voice.  It sounded clearer and clearer as he went on,  until at last he could almost distinguish the words.  In a moment or  two, keeping after the goblins round another corner, he once more  started back--this time in amazement.    He was at the entrance of a magnificent cavern, of an oval shape, once  probably a huge natural reservoir of water, now the great palace hall  of the goblins.  It rose to a tremendous height, but the roof was  composed of such shining materials, and the multitude of torches  carried by the goblins who crowded the floor lighted up the place so  brilliantly, that Curdie could see to the top quite well.  But he had  no idea how immense the place was until his eyes had got accustomed to  it, which was not for a good many minutes. The rough projections on the  walls, and the shadows thrown upwards from them by the torches, made  the sides of the chamber look as if they were crowded with statues upon  brackets and pedestals, reaching in irregular tiers from floor to roof.  The walls themselves were, in many parts, of gloriously shining  substances, some of them gorgeously coloured besides, which powerfully  contrasted with the shadows.  Curdie could not help wondering whether  his rhymes would be of any use against such a multitude of goblins as  filled the floor of the hall, and indeed felt considerably tempted to  begin his shout of 'One, two, three!', but as there was no reason for  routing them and much for endeavouring to discover their designs, he  kept himself perfectly quiet, and peering round the edge of the  doorway, listened with both his sharp ears.    At the other end of the hall, high above the heads of the multitude,  was a terrace-like ledge of considerable height, caused by the receding  of the upper part of the cavern-wall.  Upon this sat the king and his  court: the king on a throne hollowed out of a huge block of green  copper ore, and his court upon lower seats around it.  The king had  been making them a speech, and the applause which followed it was what  Curdie had heard.  One of the court was now addressing the multitude.  What he heard him say was to the following effect: 'Hence it appears  that two plans have been for some time together working in the strong  head of His Majesty for the deliverance of his people.  Regardless of  the fact that we were the first possessors of the regions they now  inhabit; regardless equally of the fact that we abandoned that region  from the loftiest motives; regardless also of the self-evident fact  that we excel them so far in mental ability as they excel us in  stature, they look upon us as a degraded race and make a mockery of all  our finer feelings.  But, the time has almost arrived when--thanks to  His Majesty's inventive genius--it will be in our power to take a  thorough revenge upon them once for all, in respect of their unfriendly  behaviour.'    'May it please Your Majesty--' cried a voice close by the door, which  Curdie recognized as that of the goblin he had followed.    'Who is he that interrupts the Chancellor?' cried another from near the  throne.    'Glump,' answered several voices.    'He is our trusty subject,' said the king himself, in a slow and  stately voice: 'let him come forward and speak.'    A lane was parted through the crowd, and Glump, having ascended the  platform and bowed to the king, spoke as follows:    'Sire, I would have held my peace, had I not known that I only knew how  near was the moment, to which the Chancellor had just referred.    In all probability, before another day is past, the enemy will have  broken through into my house--the partition between being even now not  more than a foot in thickness.'    'Not quite so much,' thought Curdie to himself.    'This very evening I have had to remove my household effects; therefore  the sooner we are ready to carry out the plan, for the execution of  which His Majesty has been making such magnificent preparations, the  better.  I may just add, that within the last few days I have perceived  a small outbreak in my dining-room, which, combined with observations  upon the course of the river escaping where the evil men enter, has  convinced me that close to the spot must be a deep gulf in its channel.  This discovery will, I trust, add considerably to the otherwise immense  forces at His Majesty's disposal.'    He ceased, and the king graciously acknowledged his speech with a bend  of his head; whereupon Glump, after a bow to His Majesty, slid down  amongst the rest of the undistinguished multitude.  Then the Chancellor  rose and resumed.    'The information which the worthy Glump has given us,' he said, 'might  have been of considerable import at the present moment, but for that  other design already referred to, which naturally takes precedence.  His Majesty, unwilling to proceed to extremities, and well aware that  such measures sooner or later result in violent reactions, has  excogitated a more fundamental and comprehensive measure, of which I  need say no more.  Should His Majesty be successful--as who dares to  doubt?--then a peace, all to the advantage of the goblin kingdom, will  be established for a generation at least, rendered absolutely secure by  the pledge which His Royal Highness the prince will have and hold for  the good behaviour of her relatives.  Should His Majesty fail--which  who shall dare even to imagine in his most secret thoughts?--then will  be the time for carrying out with rigour the design to which Glump  referred, and for which our preparations are even now all but  completed.  The failure of the former will render the latter  imperative.'    Curdie, perceiving that the assembly was drawing to a close and that  there was little chance of either plan being more fully discovered, now  thought it prudent to make his escape before the goblins began to  disperse, and slipped quietly away.    There was not much danger of meeting any goblins, for all the men at  least were left behind him in the palace; but there was considerable  danger of his taking a wrong turning, for he had now no light, and had  therefore to depend upon his memory and his hands.  After he had left  behind him the glow that issued from the door of Glump's new abode, he  was utterly without guide, so far as his eyes were concerned.    He was most anxious to get back through the hole before the goblins  should return to fetch the remains of their furniture.  It was not that  he was in the least afraid of them, but, as it was of the utmost  importance that he should thoroughly discover what the plans they were  cherishing were, he must not occasion the slightest suspicion that they  were watched by a miner.    He hurried on, feeling his way along the walls of rock.  Had he not  been very courageous, he must have been very anxious, for he could not  but know that if he lost his way it would be the most difficult thing  in the world to find it again.  Morning would bring no light into these  regions; and towards him least of all, who was known as a special  rhymester and persecutor, could goblins be expected to exercise  courtesy.  Well might he wish that he had brought his lamp and  tinder-box with him, of which he had not thought when he crept so  eagerly after the goblins!  He wished it all the more when, after a  while, he found his way blocked up, and could get no farther.  It was  of no use to turn back, for he had not the least idea where he had  begun to go wrong.  Mechanically, however, he kept feeling about the  walls"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#8)"],[1," and farm produce was shown in abundance. The prairie soil is so  rich that it yields a hundredfold, and the absence of the great  preliminary labour of \"clearing,\" which the early settlers in Ontario had  to contend with, renders it a most advantageous country for emigrants.  The chief difficulty is the scarcity of labour. All men not going out to  take up land for themselves are employed on the railway; and women either  are married and obliged to work on the farms with their husbands, or get  married before they have been long in Manitoba. Many were the complaints  I heard from people who had taken out female servants, paying their  expenses and giving them high wages, only to lose them before they had  been a month in the province. Their sole resource then was to employ  Icelanders, who often could not speak a word of English, so that all  directions had to be given by pantomime. Any one seeing the strange  gesticulations and frantic efforts of some of the more energetic  mistresses might be excused for thinking himself let loose in a city of  lunatics.    Mrs. C---- had one of these Icelanders as nursemaid, and she did very  well, picking up enough English in a few weeks to understand all we  wanted. But I noticed that, however quickly she walked about the rest of  the house, the stairs were as carefully traversed as though she had been  an Indian. One day, hearing her in great distress on the kitchen stairs,  I went to see what was the matter. The staircase was a narrow one between  two walls, but without banisters; on the third or fourth step from the  top sat one of the children, aged four years, and a few steps below stood  the maid clinging to the smooth wall, her face white with terror as,  whenever she attempted to advance, the child made a feint to oppose her  passage and push her back. Afraid either to turn round or retreat  backwards, she stood trembling and calling for help, and it was  impossible to avoid feeling amused at the absurdity of that big girl  being intimidated by such a mite--who, with the original depravity of  human nature, was enjoying the fun.    A friend of mine went through some odd experiences with these Iceland  maids. Upon the arrival of a fresh domestic she was ordered to wash down  the hall and door-steps. Next day, at the same hour, while a party of  visitors were in the drawing-room, the door burst open, and Christian,  scrubbing-pail and brush in hand, plumped down on her knees in the middle  of the floor, and went through a vigorous pantomime of scrubbing. Her  mistress was too astonished to speak for a moment or two, until the girl,  surprised at her silence, looked up, uttering an indescribable \"Eh?\" of  anxious inquiry, which was well-nigh too much for the gravity of her  listeners.    Often, after ten minutes' patient endeavour to explain something, one was  rewarded by a long drawn out \"Ma'arum?\" infinitely trying to one's  patience. Yet, in time, they often make excellent servants, and many  people prefer them to Ontario or English emigrants. And certainly in  point of economy they are infinitely superior to both; for not only will  an Iceland maid waste nothing, but she is content with five or six  dollars a month in wages (£1 5s. or £1 10s.), while girls from Ontario or  England expect nine or ten dollars. Servants taken out on the line of  railway demand and receive from fifteen to thirty dollars (£3 15s. to £7  10s.) a month. These exorbitant wages are, however, lessening as  immigration increases.    Society at Winnipeg is very pleasant; composed chiefly of the old  families who formed the Hudson Bay Company and their descendants, many of  whom have Indian blood in their veins. Their education, carefully begun  by their parents, is often completed in Scotland, and they are well-read,  intelligent people, as proud of their Indian as of their European  descent. Many of them are handsome and _distingué_-looking. Their  elegant appearance sometimes leads to awkward mistakes. One of these  ladies, meeting a young Englishman fresh from the old country, and full  of its prejudices, was entertained by him with reflections on race, and  condolences at having to associate with half-castes. At last he inquired  how long she had been in the country? Making him a stately curtsy, she  answered--    \"All my life! _I_ am one of these despised half-breeds,\" and  instantly left him. She said afterwards she was sorry for the poor  fellow's discomfiture; but he brought it upon himself by disregarding all  her efforts to change the conversation.    When younger sons of good families are sent to seek their fortunes in the  New World, their social standing is not fixed by their occupation, and a  man who has served behind a counter all day is as well received in a  drawing-room as one who has sat on the bench or pleaded a case in court.  Of course in such a state of society impostors often effect an entrance,  and their detection makes their entertainers chary of strangers  afterwards. But so long as a man behaves himself like a gentleman he is  treated as one. Many officials, sent by the Canadian Government  temporarily to fill responsible posts, and officers whose regiments have  been disbanded, remain in Winnipeg, preferring it to any other part of  Canada, and illustrating the adage, \"He who once drinks of the Red River  water cannot live without it.\" It is a very muddy stream, however, and  not at all inviting as a beverage.    A great many visitors, chiefly Englishmen, go to Manitoba for the  shooting and fishing, which are excellent. A friend of mine last year  bagged four hundred ducks, several geese, great numbers of partridges,  loons, and as many hares as he would waste shot on in a fortnight's  holiday. No doubt, when Manitoba and its capabilities become better  understood, and the line of railway is completed, the number of tourists  in search of sport will much increase.    How little the new province has been known hitherto the following fact  will show. A letter for me, mailed in a county town in England, in  September, and merely addressed to Winnipeg, Manitoba, omitting Canada,  travelled to France, where it received sundry postmarks, and such  sensible hints by the post-office officials as, \"Try Calcutta.\" At last,  some one better acquainted with the geography of this side of the globe  added, \"Nouvelle Amerique,\" and my letter reached me, _viâ_ New  York, in Christmas week, richly ornamented with postmarks, and protests  from officials that it \"came to them in that condition,\" tied together  with two varieties of string, and frankly exhibiting its contents--a pair  of lace sleeves, which, but for the honesty of the mail service, might  easily have been abstracted.          CHAPTER VI.    Winter Amusements--A Winnipeg Ball--Forty Degrees below Zero--New Year's  Day--Saskatchewan Taylor--Indian Compliments--A Dog train--Lost in the  Snow--Amateur Theatricals--Sir Walter Raleigh's Hat--A Race with the  Freshets--The Ice moves--The First Steamer of the Season--Good-bye to  Winnipeg.      Snow lay several inches thick on the ground at Christmas, and we had  sleigh drives over the smooth white prairie, one great advantage of  Manitoban winters being that when once the ground is covered with snow,  if only to the depth of five or six inches, it remains, and there is good  sleighing until the frost breaks up in March or April. Sleighing parties  are varied by skating at the rink and assemblies in the town-hall, where  we meet a medley of ball goers and givers, each indulging his or her  favourite style of dancing--from the old fashioned \"three-step\" waltz  preferred by the elders, to the breathless \"German,\" the simple _deux  temps_, and the graceful \"Boston\" dance, peculiar as yet to Americans  and Canadians. The band was composed of trained musicians who had  belonged to various regiments, and, on receiving their discharge,  remained in Canada. The hall was well lighted, the floor in good  condition, and we enjoyed taking a turn upon it, as well as watching the  Scotch reels, country dances, and Red River jigs performed by the others.    It was a gay and amusing scene, but the heavy winter dresses--many of  them short walking costumes--worn by the Manitoban belles, looked less  pretty than the light materials, bright colours, and floating trains of  an ordinary ball-room. The absence of carriages and cabs, and the  intensity of the cold, compelled ladies to adopt this sombre attire. The  mercury averaged from ten to twenty degrees below zero, frequently going  as low as thirty-three, and occasionally into the forties; yet the air is  so dry and still, that I felt the cold less when it was thirty-three  degrees below zero in Winnipeg than when only five degrees below in  Ottawa, and did not require any additional wraps.    On New Year's Day the now old-fashioned custom of gentlemen calling was  kept up, and we had many visitors, among them the American Consul, Mr.  Taylor, known in the Consulate as \"Saskatchewan Taylor,\" from his  interest in the North-West and anxiety upon all occasions to bring its  capabilities before the public. He came in the evening, and, following  the American style, remained more than an hour, so that we were able to  get beyond the conventional topics of health and weather, and found him  very pleasant and entertaining.    During the afternoon the maid came in, looking rather flurried, and said  that visitors in the kitchen wished to see us. Going there, we were  greeted by seven Indians and their squaws, come to pay a New Year's  visit. As I looked at their brown faces and long, loose hair, memories of  stories told by cousins in the Hudson Bay Company's service, of having to  kiss all the squaws on New Year's Day, sent the blood with a rush back to  my heart; but, happily, this ceremony was dispensed with. Only one of the  party could speak English--a handsome, clear-skinned, straight-featured  Indian, in blue blanket coat, red sash,"]]]
