The  council debated long on the remedies to be taken, and Law, being called  on for his advice, was of opinion, that an edict should be published,  depreciating the value of coin five per cent. below that of paper. The  edict was published accordingly; but, failing of its intended effect,  was followed by another, in which the depreciation was increased to ten  per cent. The payments of the bank were at the same time restricted to  one hundred livres in gold, and ten in silver. All these measures were  nugatory to restore confidence in the paper, though the restriction of  cash payments within limits so extremely narrow kept up the credit of  the Bank.    Notwithstanding every effort to the contrary, the precious metals  continued to be conveyed to England and Holland. The little coin that  was left in the country was carefully treasured, or hidden until the  scarcity became so great, that the operations of trade could no longer  be carried on. In this emergency, Law hazarded the bold experiment of  forbidding the use of specie altogether. In February 1720 an edict was  published, which, instead of restoring the credit of the paper, as was  intended, destroyed it irrecoverably, and drove the country to the very  brink of revolution. By this famous edict it was forbidden to any person  whatever to have more than five hundred livres (20 pounds sterling) of  coin in his possession, under pain of a heavy fine, and confiscation of  the sums found. It was also forbidden to buy up jewellery, plate,  and precious stones, and informers were encouraged to make search for  offenders, by the promise of one-half the amount they might discover.  The whole country sent up a cry of distress at this unheard-of tyranny.  The most odious persecution daily took place. The privacy of families  was violated by the intrusion of informers and their agents. The most  virtuous and honest were denounced for the crime of having been seen  with a louis d'or in their possession. Servants betrayed their  masters, one citizen became a spy upon his neighbour, and arrests and  confiscations so multiplied, that the courts found a difficulty in  getting through the immense increase of business thus occasioned. It  was sufficient for an informer to say that he suspected any person of  concealing money in his house, and immediately a search-warrant was  granted. Lord Stair, the English ambassador, said, that it was now  impossible to doubt of the sincerity of Law's conversion to the Catholic  religion; he had established the inquisition, after having given  abundant evidence of his faith in transubstantiation, by turning so much  gold into paper.    Every epithet that popular hatred could suggest was showered upon the  Regent and the unhappy Law. Coin, to any amount above five hundred  livres, was an illegal tender, and nobody would take paper if he could  help it. No one knew to-day what his notes would be worth to-morrow.  \"Never,\" says Duclos, in his Secret Memoirs of the Regency, \"was seen a  more capricious government-never was a more frantic tyranny exercised by  hands less firm. It is inconceivable to those who were witnesses of the  horrors of those times, and who look back upon them now as on a dream,  that a sudden revolution did not break out--that Law and the Regent did  not perish by a tragical death. They were both held in horror, but the  people confined themselves to complaints; a sombre and timid despair, a  stupid consternation, had seized upon all, and men's minds were too vile  even to be capable of a courageous crime.\" It would appear that, at one  time, a movement of the people was organised. Seditious writings were  posted up against the walls, and were sent, in hand-bills, to the houses  of the most conspicuous people. One of them, given in the \"Memoires de  la Regence,\" was to the following effect:--\"Sir and Madam,--This is to  give you notice that a St. Bartholomew's Day will be enacted again on  Saturday and Sunday, if affairs do not alter. You are desired not to  stir out, nor you, nor your servants. God preserve you from the flames!  Give notice to your neighbours. Dated Saturday, May 25th, 1720.\" The  immense number of spies with which the city was infested rendered the  people mistrustful of one another, and beyond some trifling disturbances  made in the evening by an insignificant group, which was soon dispersed,  the peace of the capital was not compromised.    The value of shares in the Louisiana, or Mississippi stock, had fallen  very rapidly, and few indeed were found to believe the tales that had  once been told of the immense wealth of that region. A last effort was  therefore tried to restore the public confidence in the Mississippi  project. For this purpose, a general conscription of all the poor  wretches in Paris was made by order of government. Upwards of six  thousand of the very refuse of the population were impressed, as if in  time of war, and were provided with clothes and tools to be embarked  for New Orleans, to work in the gold mines alleged to abound there.  They were paraded day after day through the streets with their pikes and  shovels, and then sent off in small detachments to the out-ports to be  shipped for America. Two-thirds of them never reached their destination,  but dispersed themselves over the country, sold their tools for what  they could get, and returned to their old course of life. In less than  three weeks afterwards, one-half of them were to be found again in  Paris. The manoeuvre, however, caused a trifling advance in Mississippi  stock. Many persons of superabundant gullibility believed that  operations had begun in earnest in the new Golconda, and that gold and  silver ingots would again be found in France.    In a constitutional monarchy some surer means would have been found for  the restoration of public credit. In England, at a subsequent period,  when a similar delusion had brought on similar distress, how  different were the measures taken to repair the evil; but in France,  unfortunately, the remedy was left to the authors of the mischief.  The arbitrary will of the Regent, which endeavoured to extricate the  country, only plunged it deeper into the mire. All payments were ordered  to be made in paper, and between the 1st of February and the end of  May, notes were fabricated to the amount of upwards of 1500 millions of  livres, or 60,000,000 pounds sterling. But the alarm once sounded, no  art could make the people feel the slightest confidence in paper which  was not exchangeable into metal. M. Lambert, the President of the  Parliament of Paris, told the Regent to his face that he would rather  have a hundred thousand livres in gold or silver than five millions  in the notes of his bank. When such was the general feeling, the  superabundant issues of paper but increased the evil, by rendering still  more enormous the disparity between the amount of specie and notes in  circulation. Coin, which it was the object of the Regent to depreciate,  rose in value on every fresh attempt to diminish it. In February, it  was judged advisable that the Royal Bank should be incorporated with  the Company of the Indies. An edict to that effect was published and  registered by the Parliament. The state remained the guarantee for the  notes of the bank, and no more were to be issued without an order in  council. All the profits of the bank, since the time it had been taken  out of Law's hands and made a national institution, were given over by  the Regent to the Company of the Indies. This measure had the effect of  raising for a short time the value of the Louisiana and other shares  of the company, but it failed in placing public credit on any permanent  basis.    A council of state was held in the beginning of May, at which Law,  D'Argenson (his colleague in the administration of the finances), and  all the ministers were present. It was then computed that the total  amount of notes in circulation was 2600 millions of livres, while the  coin in the country was not quite equal to half that amount. It was  evident to the majority of the council that some plan must be adopted to  equalise the currency. Some proposed that the notes should be reduced to  the value of the specie, while others proposed that the nominal value of  the specie should be raised till it was on an equality with the  paper. Law is said to have opposed both these projects, but failing in  suggesting any other, it was agreed that the notes should be depreciated  one-half. On the 21st of May, an edict was accordingly issued, by which  it was decreed that the shares of the Company of the Indies, and the  notes of the bank, should gradually diminish in value, till at the end  of a year they should only pass current for one half of their nominal  worth. The Parliament refused to register the edict--the greatest outcry  was excited, and the state of the country became so alarming, that, as  the only means of preserving tranquillity, the council of the regency  was obliged to stultify its own proceedings, by publishing within seven  days another edict, restoring the notes to their original value.    On the same day (the 27th of May) the bank stopped payment in specie.  Law and D'Argenson were both dismissed from the ministry. The weak,  vacillating, and cowardly Regent threw the blame of all the mischief  upon Law, who, upon presenting himself at the Palais Royal, was refused  admitance. At nightfall, however, he was sent for, and admitted into the  palace by a secret door,[Duclos, Memoires Secrets de la Regence.] when  the Regent endeavoured to console him, and made all manner of excuses  for the severity with which in public he had been compelled to treat  him. So capricious was his conduct, that, two days afterwards, he took  him publicly to the opera, where he sat in the royal box, alongside of  the Regent, who treated him with marked consideration in face of all the  people."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#8)"],[1,"understand; so do I.\"    Some things perhaps I did understand, but how few the near future was to  show.    The signal for our departure from table was given by Madame de Staemer.  She whisked her chair back with extraordinary rapidity, the contrast  between her swift, nervous movements and those still, basilisk eyes  being almost uncanny.    \"Off you go, Juan,\" she said; \"your visitors would like to see the  garden, no doubt. I must be away for my afternoon siesta. Come, my  dear\"--to the girl--\"smoke one little cigarette with me, then I will let  you go.\"    She retired, wheeling herself rapidly out of the room, and my glance  lingered upon the graceful figure of Val Beverley until both she and  Madame were out of sight.    \"Now, gentlemen,\" said the Colonel, resuming his seat and pushing the  decanter toward Paul Harley, \"I am at your service either for business  or amusement. I think\"--to Harley--\"you expressed a desire to see the  tower?\"    \"I did,\" my friend replied, lighting his cigar, \"but only if it would  amuse you to show me.\"    \"Decidedly. Mr. Knox will join us?\"    Harley, unseen by the Colonel, glanced at me in a way which I knew.    \"Thanks all the same,\" I said, smiling, \"but following a perfect  luncheon I should much prefer to loll upon the lawn, if you don't mind.\"    \"But certainly I do not mind,\" cried the Colonel. \"I wish you to be  happy.\"    \"Join you in a few minutes, Knox,\" said Harley as he went out with our  host.    \"All right,\" I replied, \"I should like to take a stroll around the  gardens. You will join me there later, no doubt.\"    As I walked out into the bright sunshine I wondered why Paul Harley had  wished to be left alone with Colonel Menendez, but knowing that I should  learn his motive later, I strolled on through the gardens, my mind  filled with speculations respecting these unusual people with whom Fate  had brought me in contact. I felt that Miss Beverley needed protection  of some kind, and I was conscious of a keen desire to afford her that  protection. In her glance I had read, or thought I had read, an appeal  for sympathy.    Not the least mystery of Cray's Folly was the presence of this girl.  Only toward the end of luncheon had I made up my mind upon a point which  had been puzzling me. Val Beverley's gaiety was a cloak. Once I had  detected her watching Madame de Staemer with a look strangely like that  of fear.    Puffing contentedly at my cigar I proceeded to make a tour of the house.  It was constructed irregularly. Practically the entire building was  of gray stone, which created a depressing effect even in the blazing  sunlight, lending Cray's Folly something of an austere aspect. There  were fine lofty windows, however, to most of the ground-floor rooms  overlooking the lawns, and some of those above had balconies of the same  gray stone. Quite an extensive kitchen garden and a line of glasshouses  adjoined the west wing, and here were outbuildings, coach-houses and a  garage, all connected by a covered passage with the servants' quarters.    Pursuing my enquiries, I proceeded to the north front of the building,  which was closely hemmed in by trees, and which as we had observed on  our arrival resembled the entrance to a monastery.    Passing the massive oaken door by which we had entered and which was now  closed again, I walked on through the opening in the box hedge into a  part of the grounds which was not so sprucely groomed as the rest. On  one side were the yews flanking the Tudor garden and before me uprose  the famous tower. As I stared up at the square structure, with its  uncurtained windows, I wondered, as others had wondered before me, what  could have ever possessed any man to build it.    Visible at points for many miles around, it undoubtedly disfigured an  otherwise beautiful landscape.    I pressed on, noting that the windows of the rooms in the east wing were  shuttered and the apartments evidently disused. I came to the base of  the tower, To the south, the country rose up to the highest point in  the crescent of hills, and peeping above the trees at no great distance  away, I detected the red brick chimneys of some old house in the woods.  North and east, velvet sward swept down to the park.    As I stood there admiring the prospect and telling myself that no  Voodoo devilry could find a home in this peaceful English countryside,  I detected a faint sound of voices far above. Someone had evidently come  out upon the gallery of the tower. I looked upward, but I could not see  the speakers. I pursued my stroll, until, near the eastern base of the  tower, I encountered a perfect thicket of rhododendrons. Finding no  path through this shrubbery, I retraced my steps, presently entering  the Tudor garden; and there strolling toward me, a book in her hand, was  Miss Beverley.    \"Holloa, Mr. Knox,\" she called; \"I thought you had gone up the tower?\"    \"No,\" I replied, laughing, \"I lack the energy.\"    \"Do you?\" she said, softly, \"then sit down and talk to me.\"    She dropped down upon a grassy bank, looking up at me invitingly, and I  accepted the invitation without demur.    \"I love this old garden,\" she declared, \"although of course it is really  no older than the rest of the place. I always think there should be  peacocks, though.\"    \"Yes,\" I agreed, \"peacocks would be appropriate.\"    \"And little pages dressed in yellow velvet.\"    She met my glance soberly for a moment and then burst into a peal of  merry laughter.    \"Do you know, Miss Beverley,\" I said, watching her, \"I find it hard to  place you in the household of the Colonel.\"    \"Yes?\" she said simply; \"you must.\"    \"Oh, then you realize that you are--\"    \"Out of place here?\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Of course I am.\"    She smiled, shook her head, and changed the subject.    \"I am so glad Mr. Paul Harley has come down,\" she confessed.    \"You know my friend by name, then?\"    \"Yes,\" she replied, \"someone I met in Nice spoke of him, and I know he  is very clever.\"    \"In Nice? Did you live in Nice before you came here?\"    Val Beverley nodded slowly, and her glance grew oddly retrospective.    \"I lived for over a year with Madame de Staemer in a little villa on  the Promenade des Anglaise,\" she replied. \"That was after Madame was  injured.\"    \"She sustained her injuries during the war, I understand?\"    \"Yes. Poor Madame. The hospital of which she was in charge was bombed  and the shock left her as you see her. I was there, too, but I luckily  escaped without injury.\"    \"What, you were there?\"    \"Yes. That was where I first met Madame de Staemer. She used to be very  wealthy, you see, and she established this hospital in France at her own  expense, and I was one of her assistants for a time. She lost both her  husband and her fortune in the war, and as if that were not bad enough,  lost the use of her limbs, too.\"    \"Poor woman,\" I said. \"I had no idea her life had been so tragic. She  has wonderful courage.\"    \"Courage!\" exclaimed the girl, \"if you knew all that I know about her.\"    Her face grew sweetly animated as she bent toward me excitedly and  confidentially.    \"Really, she is simply wonderful. I learned to respect her in those days  as I have never respected any other woman in the world; and when, after  all her splendid work, she, so vital and active, was stricken down like  that, I felt that I simply could not leave her, especially as she asked  me to stay.\"    \"So you went with her to Nice?\"    \"Yes. Then the Colonel took this house, and we came here, but--\"    She hesitated, and glanced at me curiously.    \"Perhaps you are not quite happy?\"    \"No,\" she said, \"I am not. You see it was different in France. I knew so  many people. But here at Cray's Folly it is so lonely, and Madame is--\"    Again she hesitated.    \"Yes?\"    \"Well,\" she laughed in an embarrassed fashion, \"I am afraid of her at  times.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"Oh, in a silly, womanish sort of way. Of course she is a wonderful  manager; she rules the house with a rod of iron. But really I haven't  anything to do here, and I feel frightfully out of place sometimes. Then  the Colonel--Oh, but what am I talking about?\"    \"Won't you tell me what it is that the Colonel fears?\"    \"You know that he fears something, then?\"    \"Of course. That is why Paul Harley is here.\"    A change came over the girl's face; a look almost of dread.    \"I wish I knew what it all meant.\"    \"You are aware, then, that there is something wrong?\"    \"Naturally I am. Sometimes I have been so frightened that I have made up  my mind to leave the very next day.\"    \"You mean that you have been frightened at night?\" I asked with  curiosity.    \"Dreadfully frightened.\"    \"Won't you tell me in what way?\"    She looked up at me swiftly, then turned her head aside, and bit her  lip.    \"No, not now,\" she replied. \"I can't very well.\"    \"Then at least tell me why you stayed?\"    \"Well,\" she smiled rather pathetically, \"for one thing, I haven't  anywhere else to go.\"    \"Have you no friends in England?\"    She shook her head.    \"No. There was only poor daddy, and he died over two years ago. That was  when I went to Nice.\"    \"Poor little girl,\" I said; and the words were spoken before I realized  their undue familiarity.    An apology was on the tip of my tongue, but Miss Beverley did not seem  to have noticed the indiscretion. Indeed my sympathy was sincere, and I  think she had appreciated the fact.    She looked up again with a bright smile.    \"Why are we talking about such depressing things on this simply heavenly  day?\" she exclaimed.    \"Goodness knows,\" said I. \"Will you show me round these lovely gardens?\"    \"Delighted, sir!\" replied the girl, rising and sweeping me a mocking  curtsey.    Thereupon we set out, and at every step I found a new delight in some  wayward curl, in a gesture, in the sweet voice of my companion. Her  merry laugh was music, but in wistful mood I think she was even more  alluring.    The menace, if"]]]
