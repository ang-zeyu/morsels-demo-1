[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],[0,"Mr. Justice Raffles (#8)"],[1,"    \"Could you have disturbed him when you went?\"    Raffles shook his head.    \"I never shut a door more carefully in my life. I made row enough when I  came back, Bunny, on purpose to wake him up, and I can tell you it gave  me a turn when there wasn't a sound from in there! He'd shut all the  doors after him; it was a second or two before I had the pluck to open  them. I thought something horrible had happened!\"    \"You don't think so still?\"    \"I don't know what to think,\" said Raffles, gloomily; \"nothing has panned  out as I thought it would. You must remember that we have given ourselves  away to Dan Levy, whatever else we have done, and without doubt set up  the enemy of our lives in the very next street. It's close quarters,  Bunny; we shall have an expert eye upon us for some time to come. But I  should rather enjoy that than otherwise, if only Teddy hadn't bolted in  this rotten way.\"    Never had I known Raffles in so pessimistic a mood. I did not share his  sombre view of either matter, though I confined my remarks to the one  that seemed to weigh most heavily on his mind.    \"A guinea to a gooseberry,\" I wagered, \"that you find your man safe and  sound at Lord's.\"    \"I rang them up ten minutes ago,\" said Raffles. \"They hadn't heard of him  then; besides, here's his cricket-bag.\"    \"He may have been at the club when I fetched it away--I never asked.\"    \"I did, Bunny. I rang them up as well, just after you had left.\"    \"Then what about his father's house?\"    \"That's our one chance,\" said Raffles. \"They're not on the telephone, but  now that you're here I've a good mind to drive out and see if Teddy's  there. You know what a state he was in last night, and you know how a  thing can seem worse when you wake and remember it than it did at the  time it happened. I begin to hope he's gone straight to old Garland with  the whole story; in that case he's bound to come back for his kit; and by  Jove, Bunny, there's a step upon the stairs!\"    We had left the doors open behind us, and a step it was, ascending  hastily enough to our floor. But it was not the step of a very young man,  and Raffles was the first to recognise the fact; his face fell as we  looked at each other for a single moment of suspense; in another he was  out of the room, and I heard him greeting Mr. Garland on the landing.    \"Then you haven't brought Teddy with you?\" I heard Raffles add.    \"Do you mean to say he isn't here?\" replied so pleasant a voice--in  accents of such acute dismay--that Mr. Garland had my sympathy  before we met.    \"He has been,\" said Raffles, \"and I'm expecting him back every minute.  Won't you come in and wait, Mr. Garland?\"    The pleasant voice made an exclamation of premature relief; the pair  entered, and I was introduced to the last person I should have suspected  of being a retired brewer at all, much less of squandering his money in  retirement as suggested by his son. I was prepared for a conventional  embodiment of reckless prosperity, for a pseudo-military type in louder  purple and finer linen than the real thing. I shook hands instead with a  gentle, elderly man, whose kindly eyes beamed bravely amid careworn  furrows, and whose slightly diffident yet wholly cordial address won my  heart outright.    \"So you've lost no time in welcoming the wanderer!\" said he. \"You're  nearly as bad as my boy, who was quite bent on seeing Raffles last night  or first thing this morning. He told me he should stay the night in town  if necessary, and he evidently has.\"    There was still a trace of anxiety in the father's manner, but there was  also a twinkle in his eyes, which kindled with genial fires as Raffles  gave a perfectly truthful account of the young man's movements (as  distinct from his words and deeds) overnight.    \"And what do you think of his great news?\" asked Mr. Garland. \"Was it a  surprise to you, Raffles?\"    Raffles shook his head with a rather weary smile, and I sat up in my  chair. What great news was this?    \"This son of mine has just got engaged,\" explained Mr. Garland for my  benefit. \"And as a matter of fact it's his engagement that brings me  here; you gentlemen mustn't think I want to keep an eagle eye upon him;  but Miss Belsize has just wired to say she is coming up early to go with  us to the match, instead of meeting at Lord's, and I thought she would be  so disappointed not to find Teddy, especially as they are bound to see  very little of each other all day.\"    I for my part was wondering why I had not heard of Miss Belsize or this  engagement from Raffles. He must himself have heard of it last thing at  night in the next room, while I was star-gazing here at the open window.  Yet in all the small hours he had never told me of a circumstance which  extenuated young Garland's conduct if it did nothing else. Even now it  was not from Raffles that I received either word or look of explanation.  But his face had suddenly lit up.    \"May I ask,\" he exclaimed, \"if the telegram was to Teddy or to you,  Mr. Garland?\"    \"It was addressed to Teddy, but of course I opened it in his absence.\"    \"Could it have been an answer to an invitation or suggestion of his?\"    \"Very easily. They had lunch together yesterday, and Camilla might have  had to consult Lady Laura.\"    \"Then that's the whole thing!\" cried Raffles. \"Teddy was on his way home  while you were on yours into town! How did you come?\"    \"In the brougham.\"    \"Through the Park?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"While he was in a hansom in Knightsbridge or Kensington Gore! That's  how you missed him,\" said Raffles confidently. \"If you drive straight  back you'll be in time to take him on to Lord's.\"    Mr. Garland begged us both to drive back with him; and we thought we  might; we decided that we would, and were all three under way in about a  minute. Yet it was considerably after eleven when we bowled through  Kensington to a house that I had never seen before, a house since swept  away by the flowing tide of flats, but I can still see every stone and  slate of it as clearly as on that summer morning more than ten years ago.  It stood just off the thoroughfare, in grounds of its own out of all  keeping with their metropolitan environment; they ran from one  side-street to another, and further back than we could see. Vivid lawn  and towering tree, brilliant beds and crystal vineries, struck one more  forcibly (and favourably) than the mullioned and turreted mansion of a  house. And yet a double stream of omnibuses rattled incessantly within a  few yards of the steps on which the three of us soon stood nonplussed.    Mr. Edward had not been seen or heard of at the house. Neither had Miss  Belsize arrived; that was the one consolatory feature.    \"Come into the library,\" said Mr. Garland; and when we were among his  books, which were somewhat beautifully bound and cased in glass, he  turned to Raffles and added hoarsely: \"There's something in all this I  haven't been told, and I insist on knowing what it is.\"    \"But you know as much as I do,\" protested Raffles. \"I went out leaving  Teddy asleep and came back to find him flown.\"    \"What time was that?\"    \"Between nine and half-past when I went out. I was away nearly an hour.\"    \"Why leave him asleep at that time of morning?\"    \"I wanted him to have every minute he could get. We had been sitting up  rather late.\"    \"But why, Raffles? What could you have to talk about all night when you  were tired and it was Teddy's business to keep fresh for to-day? Why,  after all, should he want to see you the moment you got back? He's not  the first young fellow who's got rather suddenly engaged to a charming  girl; is he in any trouble about it, Raffles?\"    \"About his engagement--not that I'm aware.\"    \"Then he is in some trouble?\"    \"He was, Mr. Garland,\" answered Raffles. \"I give you my word that he  isn't now.\"    Mr. Garland grasped the back of a chair.    \"Was it some money trouble, Raffles? Of course, if my boy has given you  his confidence, I have no right simply as his father--\"    \"It is hardly that, sir,\" said Raffles, gently; \"it is I who have no  right to give him away. But if you don't mind leaving it at that, Mr.  Garland, there is perhaps no harm in my saying that it _was_ about some  little temporary embarrassment that Teddy was so anxious to see me.\"    \"And you helped him?\" cried the poor man, plainly torn between gratitude  and humiliation.    \"Not out of my pocket,\" replied Raffles, smiling. \"The matter was not so  serious as Teddy thought; it only required adjustment.\"    \"God bless you, Raffles!\" murmured Mr. Garland, with a catch in his  voice. \"I won't ask for a single detail. My poor boy went to the right  man; he knew better than to come to me. Like father, like son!\" he  muttered to himself, and dropped into the chair he had been handling, and  bent his head over his folded arms.    He seemed to have forgotten the untoward effect of Teddy's disappearance  in the peculiar humiliation of its first cause. Raffles took out his  watch, and held up the dial for me to see. It was after the half-hour  now; but at this moment a servant entered with a missive, and the master  recovered his self-control.    \"This'll be from Teddy!\" he cried, fumbling with his glasses. \"No; it's  for him, and by special messenger. I'd better open it. I don't suppose  it's Miss Belsize again.\"    \"Miss Belsize is in the drawing-room, sir,\" said the man. \"She said you  were not to be disturbed.\"    \"Oh, tell her we shan't be long,\" said Mr. Garland, with a new strain of  trouble in his tone. \"Listen to this--listen to this,\" he went on before  the door was shut: \"'What has happened? Lost toss. Whipham plays if you  don't turn up in time.--J. S.'\"    \"Jack Studley,\" said Raffles, \"the Cambridge skipper.\"    \"I know! I know! And Whipham's reserve man, isn't he?\"    \"And another wicket-keeper, worse luck!\" exclaimed Raffles. \"If he turns  out and takes a single ball, and Teddy is only one over late, it will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/984"],[0,"Who Was Who: 5000 B.
