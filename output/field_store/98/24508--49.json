So we returned without a halt, covering  some twelve of the roughest miles in two hours and a quarter.    The morning of the 26th showed an ugly sight from the tall  Kinsembo cliff. As far as the eye could reach long green-black  lines, fronted and feathered with frosted foam, hurried up to the  war with loud merciless roars, and dashed themselves in white  destruction against the reefs and rock-walls. We did not escape  till the next day.    Kinsembo does not appear upon the old maps, and our earliest  hydrographic charts place it six miles wrong.[FN#5] The station  was created in 1857-61 by the mistaken policy of Loanda, which  determined to increase the customs three per cent, and talked of  exacting duties at Ambriz, not according to invoice prices, but  upon the value which imported goods represented amongst the  natives. It was at once spread abroad that the object was to  drive the wax and ivory trade to São Paulo, and to leave Ambriz  open to slavers. The irrepressible Briton transferred himself to  Kinsembo, and agreed to pay the king £9 in kind, after \"country  fashion,\" for every ship. In 1857 the building of the new  factories was opposed by the Portuguese, and was supported by  English naval officers, till the two governments came to an  arrangement. In February, 1860, the Kinsembo people seized an  English factory, and foully murdered a Congo prince and  Portuguese subject, D. Nicoláo de Agua Rosada, employed in the  Treasury Department, Ambriz. Thereupon the Governor-General sent  up two vessels, with thirty guns and troops; crossed the Loge  River, now a casus belli; and, on March 3rd, burned down the  inland town of Kinsembo. On the return march the column debouched  upon the foreign factories. About one mile in front of the point,  Captain Brerit, U.S. Navy, and Commander A. G. Fitzroy, R.N., had  drawn up 120 of their men by way of guard. Leave was asked by the  Portuguese to refresh their troops, and to house six or seven  wounded men. The foreign agents, headed by a disreputable M--M--,  now dead, protested, and, after receiving this unsoldierlike  refusal, the Portuguese, harassed by the enemy, continued their  return march to Ambriz. The natives of this country have an  insane hate for their former conquerors, and can hardly explain  why: probably the cruelties of the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries, not peculiar to the Lusitanians, have rankled in the  national memory. A stray Portuguese would infallibly be put to  death, and it will, I fear, be long before M. Valdez sees  \"spontaneous declarations of vassalage on the part of the King of  Molembo (Malemba) and others.\"    In 1860 the trade of Kinsembo amounted to some £50,000, divided  amongst four houses, two English, one American, and one Rotterdam  (Pencoff and Kerdyk). The Cassange war greatly benefited the new  station by diverting coffee and other produce of the interior  from Loanda. There are apochryphal tales of giant tusks brought  from a five months' journey, say 500 miles, inland. I was shown  two species of copal (gum anime) of which the best is said to  come from the Mosul country up the Ambriz River: one bore the  goose-skin of Zanzibar, and I was assured that it does not  viscidize in the potash-wash. The other was smooth as if it had  freshly fallen from the tree. It was impossible to obtain any  information; no one had been up country to see the diggings, and  yet all declared that the interior was open; that it would be  easy to strike the Coango (Quango) before it joins the Congo  River, and that 150 miles, which we may perhaps reduce by a  third, would lodge the traveller in the unknown lands of \"Hnga.\"    Bidding kindly adieu to Mr. Hunter and wishing him speedy  deliverance from his dreadful companion, we resumed our travel  over the now tranquil main. Always to starboard remained the  narrow sea-wall, a length without breadth which we had seen after  the lowlands of Cape Lopez, coloured rosy, rusty-red, or white,  and sometimes backed by a second sierra of low blue rises, which  suggests the sanatorium. Forty miles showed us the tall trees of  Point Palmas on the northern side of the Conza River; on the  south of the gap-like mouth lies the Ambrizette settlement, with  large factories, Portuguese and American, gleaming against the  dark verdure, and with Conza Hill for a background. The Cabeça de  Cobra, or \"Margate Head,\" led to Makula, alias Mangal, or Mangue  Grande, lately a clump of trees and a point; now the site of  English, American, and Dutch factories. Here the hydrographic  charts of 1827 and 1863 greatly vary, and one has countermarched  the coast-line some 75 miles: Beginning with the Congo River, it  lays down Mangue Pegueno (where Grande should be), Cobra, and  Mangue Grande (for Pequeno) close to Ambrizette. Then hard ahead  rose Cape Engano, whose \"deceit\" is a rufous tint, which causes  many to mistake it for Cape or Point Padrão. To-morrow, as the  dark-green waters tell us, we shall be in the Congo River.                                       Chapter V.    Into the Congo River.--the Factories.--trip to Shark's Point.--                       the Padrão and Pinda.        The best preparation for a first glance at the Congo River is to  do as all do, to study the quaint description which old Purchas  borrowed from the \"Chronica da Companhia de Jesus em Portugal.\"    \"The Zaire is of such force that no ship can get in against the  current but near to the shore; yea, it prevails against the  ocean's saltness three-score, and as some say, four-score miles  within the sea, before his proud waves yield their full homage,  and receive that salt temper in token of subjection. Such is the  haughty spirit of that stream, overrunning the low countries as  it passeth, and swollen with conceit of daily conquests and daily  supplies, which, in armies of showers, are, by the clouds, sent  to his succour, runnes now in a furious rage, thinking even to  swallow the ocean, which before he never saw, with his mouth wide  gaping eight-and-twenty miles, as Lopez[FN#6] affirmeth, in the  opening; but meeting with a more giant-like enemie which lies  lurking under the cliffes to receive his assault, is presently  swallowed in that wider womb, yet so as, always being conquered,  he never gives over, but in an eternall quarrel, with deeper and  indented frownes in his angry face, foaming with disclaine, and  filling the aire with noise (with fresh helpe), supplies those  forces which the salt sea hath consumed.\"    I was disappointed after the Gambia and Gaboon rivers in the  approach to the Congo. About eight miles south of the mouth the  green sea changed to a clear brown which will be red during the  flood. Some three degrees (F. 79° to 82°) cooler than the salt  tide, the lighter water, which was fresh as rain, feathered out  like a fan; a rippling noise was faintly audible, and the clear  lines of white foam had not time to melt into the coloured  efflux. The flow was diverted into a regular curve northwards by  the South Atlantic current; voyagers from Ascension Island to the  north-west therefore feel the full throb of the great riverine  pulse, and it has been recognized, they say, at a distance of 300  miles. Lopez, Merolla, and Dapper[FN#7] agree that the Congo  freshens the water at thirty miles from the mouth, and that it  can be distinguished thirty leagues off. The Amazonas tinges the  sea along the Guiana coast 200 miles, and the effect of the  Ganges extends to about twenty leagues. At this season, of  course, we saw none of the floating islands which during the  rains sail out sixty to seventy leagues from land. \"Tuckey's  Expedition\" informs us, that the Hon. Captain Irby, H.M.S.  \"Amelia,\" when anchored twelve miles from the South Point, in  fifteen fathoms, \"observed on the ocean large floating islands  covered with trees and bushes, which had been torn from the banks  by the violent current.\" The Journal of Captain Scobell, H.M.S.  \"Thais,\" remarks: \"In crossing this stream I met several floating  islands or broken masses from the banks of that noble river.\" We  shall find them higher up the bed, only forming as the inundation  begins; I doubt, however, that at any time they equal the meadows  which stud the mouth of the Rio Formoso (Benin River).    Historic Point Padrao, the \"Mouta Seca,\" or Dry Bush, of the  modern Portuguese, showed no signs of hospitality. The fierce  rollers of the spumous sea broke and recoiled, foaming upon the  sandy beach, which they veiled with a haze of water-dust, almost  concealing the smoke that curled from the mangrove-hedged \"King  Antonio's Town.\" Then, steaming to the north-east, we ran five  miles to Turtle Cove, formerly Turtle Corner, a shallow bay,  whose nearest point is \"Twitty Twa Bush,\" the baptismal effort of  some English trader. And now appeared the full gape of the Congo  mouth, yawning seven sea-miles wide; the further shore trending  to the north-west in a low blue line, where Moanda and Vista,  small \"shipping-ports\" for slaves, were hardly visible in the  hazy air. As we passed the projecting tooth of Shark Point, a  sandspit garnished with mangroves and dotted with palmyras, the  land-squali flocked from their dirty-brown thatches to the beach,  where flew the symbolic red flag. Unlike most other settlements,  which are so buried in almost impenetrable bush that the  traveller may pass by within a few yards without other sign but  the human voice, this den of thieves and wreckers, justly named  in more ways than one, flaunts itself in the face of day.    The Congo disclaims a bore, but it has a very distinct bar, the  angle pointing up stream, and the legs beginning about Bananal  Bank (N.) and Alligator River (S.). Here the great depth above  and below (145 and 112 fathoms) shallows to 6-9. Despite the  five-knot current we were \"courteously received into the embraces  of the river;\" H.M. Steamship \"Griffon\" wanted no \"commanding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#8)"],[1,"let sink, to lower, _kulu_.    _falaete_ adv., only.
