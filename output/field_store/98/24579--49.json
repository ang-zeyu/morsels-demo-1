A plea was made for her, and her  sorrowful story was told in her behalf.  She spoke, too, by  permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind  was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne  with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through  her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so  hungry!  For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition  to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and  friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her  of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her  transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas  these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there  was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would  be a danger to property--oh, my God, is there no property in ruined  homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law  holds precious!--and so he must require sentence.    \"When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen  linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as  ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, 'Oh, poor  child, poor child, I did not know it was death!' and fell as a  tree falls.  When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before  the sun was set, he had taken his own life.  A kindly man; a man  whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that  is to be now done here; and charge them both where they belong  --to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain.  The time is come, my  child; let me pray over thee--not _for_ thee, dear abused poor heart  and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death,  who need it more.\"    After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck,  and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear,  because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it,  and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it  with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the  baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over  what it took for romp and play.  Even the hangman couldn't stand it,  but turned away.  When all was ready the priest gently pulled and  tugged and forced the child out of the mother's arms, and stepped  quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a  wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope--and the  under-sheriff--held her short.  Then she went on her knees and  stretched out her hands and cried:    \"One more kiss--oh, my God, one more, one more,--it is the dying  that begs it!\"    She got it; she almost smothered the little thing.  And when they  got it away again, she cried out:    \"Oh, my child, my darling, it will die!  It has no home, it has  no father, no friend, no mother--\"    \"It has them all!\" said that good priest.  \"All these will I be  to it till I die.\"    You should have seen her face then!  Gratitude?  Lord, what do  you want with words to express that?  Words are only painted fire;  a look is the fire itself.  She gave that look, and carried it away  to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7254"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#8)"],[1,"they were to be adapted, we must distinguish what they contain that is  real from what is merely imaginary. To avoid entering here into minute  particulars, I shall begin first to call the attention of the reader  to those spots which have been, at various periods, the theatre of the  expeditions undertaken for the discovery of El Dorado. When we have  learnt to know the aspect of the country, and the local circumstances,  such as they can now be described, it will be easy to conceive how the  different hypotheses recorded on our maps have taken rise by degrees,  and have modified each other. To oppose an error, it is sufficient to  recall to mind the variable forms in which we have seen it appear at  different periods.    Till the middle of the eighteenth century, all that vast space of land  comprised between the mountains of French Guiana and the forests of  the Upper Orinoco, between the sources of the Carony and the River  Amazon (from 0 to 4 degrees of north latitude, and from 57 to 68  degrees of longitude), was so little known that geographers could  place in it lakes where they pleased, create communications between  rivers, and figure chains of mountains more or less lofty. They have  made full use of this liberty; and the situation of lakes, as well as  the course and branches of rivers, has been varied in so many ways  that it would not be surprising if among the great number of maps some  were found that trace the real state of things. The field of  hypotheses is now singularly narrowed. I have determined the longitude  of Esmeralda in the Upper Orinoco; more to the east amid the plains of  Parima (a land as unknown as Wangara and Dar-Saley, in Africa), a band  of twenty leagues broad has been travelled over from north to south  along the banks of the Rio Carony and the Rio Branco in the longitude  of sixty-three degrees. This is the perilous road which was taken by  Don Antonio Santos in going from Santo Thome del Angostura to Rio  Negro and the Amazon; by this road also the colonists of Surinam  communicated very recently with the inhabitants of Grand Para. This  road divides the terra incognita of Parima into two unequal portions;  and fixes limits at the same time to the sources of the Orinoco, which  it is no longer possible to carry back indefinitely toward the east,  without supposing that the bed of the Rio Branco, which flows from  north to south, is crossed by the bed of the Upper Orinoco, which  flows from east to west. If we follow the course of the Rio Branco, or  that strip of cultivated land which is dependent on the Capitania  General of Grand Para, we see lakes, partly imaginary and partly  enlarged by geographers, forming two distinct groups. The first of  these groups includes the lakes which they place between the Esmeralda  and the Rio Branco; and to the second belong those that are supposed  to lie between the Rio Branco and the mountains of Dutch and French  Guiana. It results from this sketch that the question whether there  exists a lake Parima on the east of the Rio Branco is altogether  foreign to the problem of the sources of the Orinoco.    Beside the country which we have just noticed (the Dorado de la  Parime, traversed by the Rio Branco), another part of America is  found, two hundred and sixty leagues toward the west, near the eastern  back of the Cordillera of the Andes, equally celebrated in the  expeditions to El Dorado. This is the Mesopotamia between the Caqueta,  the Rio Negro, the Uaupes, and the Yurubesh, of which I have already  given a particular account; it is the Dorado of the Omaguas which  contains Lake Manoa of Father Acunha, the Laguna de oro of the Guanes  and the auriferous land whence Father Fritz received plates of beaten  gold in his mission on the Amazon, toward the end of the seventeenth  century.    The first and above all the most celebrated enterprises attempted in  search of El Dorado were directed toward the eastern back of the Andes  of New Grenada. Fired with the ideas which an Indian of Tacunga had  given of the wealth of the king or zaque of Cundirumarca, Sebastian de  Belalcazar, in 1535, sent his captains Anasco and Ampudia, to discover  the valley of El Dorado,* twelve days' journey from Guallabamba,  consequently in the mountains between Pasto and Popayan. (* El valle  del Dorado. Pineda relates: que mas adelante de la provincia de la  Canela se hallan tierras muy ricas, adonde andaban los hombres armados  de piecas y joyas de oro, y que no havia sierra, ni montana. [Beyond  the province of Canela there are found very rich countries (though  without mountains) in which the natives are adorned with trinkets and  plates of gold.] Herrera dec. 5 lib. 10 cap. 14 and dec. 6 lib. 8 cap.  6 Geogr. Blaviana volume 11 page 261. Southey tome 1 pages 78 and  373.) The information which Pedro de Anasco had obtained from the  natives, joined to that which was received subsequently (1536) by Diaz  de Pineda, who had discovered the provinces of Quixos and Canela,  between the Rio Napo and the Rio Pastaca, gave birth to the idea that  on the east of the Nevados of Tunguragua, Cayambe, and Popayan, were  vast plains, abounding in precious metals, and where the inhabitants  were covered with armour of massy gold. Gonzales Pizarro, in searching  for these treasures, discovered accidentally, in 1539, the  cinnamon-trees of America (Laurus cinnamomoides, Mut.); and Francisco  de Orellana went down the Napo, to reach the river Amazon. Since that  period expeditions were undertaken at the same time from Venezuela,  New Grenada, Quito, Peru, and even from Brazil and the Rio de la  Plata,* for the conquest of El Dorado. (* Nuno de Chaves went from the  Ciudad de la Asumpcion, situate on Rio Paraguay, to discover, in the  latitude of 24 degrees south, the vast empire of El Dorado, which was  everywhere supposed to lie on the eastern back of the Andes.) Those of  which the remembrance have been best preserved, and which have most  contributed to spread the fable of the riches of the Manaos, the  Omaguas, and the Guaypes, as well as the existence of the lagunas de  oro, and the town of the gilded king (Grand Patiti, Grand Moxo, Grand  Paru, or Enim), are the incursions made to the south of the Guaviare,  the Rio Fragua, and the Caqueta. Orellana, having found idols of massy  gold, had fixed men's ideas on an auriferous land between the Papamene  and the Guaviare. His narrative, and those of the voyages of Jorge de  Espira (George von Speier), Hernan Perez de Quesada, and Felipe de  Urre (Philip von Huten), undertaken in 1536, 1542, and 1545, furnish,  amid much exaggeration, proofs of very exact local knowledge.* (* We  may be surprised to see, that the expedition of Huten is passed over  in absolute silence by Herrera (dec. 7 lib. 10 cap. 7 volume 4 238).  Fray Pedro Simon gives the whole particulars of it, true or fabulous;  but he composed his work from materials that were unknown to Herrera.)  When these are examined merely in a geographical point of view, we  perceive the constant desire of the first conquistadores to reach the  land comprised between the sources of the Rio Negro, of the Uaupes  (Guape), and of the Jupura or Caqueta. This is the land which, in  order to distinguish it from El Dorado de la Parime, we have called El  Dorado des Omaguas.* (* In 1560 Pedro de Ursua even took the title of  Governador del Dorado y de Omagua. Fray Pedro Simon volume 6 chapter  10 page 430.) No doubt the whole country between the Amazon and the  Orinoco was vaguely known by the name of las Provincias del Dorado;  but in this vast extent of forests, savannahs, and mountains, the  progress of those who sought the great lake with auriferous banks, and  the town of the gilded king, was directed towards two points only, on  the north-east and south-west of the Rio Negro; that is, to Parima (or  the isthmus between the Carony, the Essequibo, and the Rio Branco),  and to the ancient abode of the Manaos, the inhabitants of the banks  of the Yurubesh. I have just mentioned the situation of the latter  spot, which is celebrated in the history of the conquest from 1535 to  1560; and it remains for me to speak of the configuration of the  country between the Spanish missions of the Rio Carony, and the  Portuguese missions of the Rio Branco or Parima. This is the country  lying near the Lower Orinoco, the Esmeralda, and French and Dutch  Guiana, on which, since the end of the sixteenth century, the  enterprises and exaggerated narratives of Raleigh have shed so bright  a splendour.    From the general disposition of the course of the Orinoco, directed  successively towards the west, the north, and the east, its mouth lies  almost in the same meridian as its sources: so that by proceeding from  Vieja Guyana to the south the traveller passes through the whole of  the country in which geographers have successively placed an inland  sea (Mar Blanco), and the different lakes which are connected with the  El Dorado de la Parime. We find first the Rio Carony, which is formed  by the union of two branches of almost equal magnitude, the Carony  properly so called, and the Rio Paragua. The missionaries of Piritu  call the latter river a lake (laguna): it is full of shoals, and  little cascades; but, passing through a country entirely flat, it is  subject at the same time to great inundations, and its real bed (su  verdadera caxa) can scarcely be discovered. The natives have given it  the name of Paragua or Parava, which means in the Caribbee language  sea, or great lake. These local circumstances and this denomination no  doubt have given rise to the idea of transforming the Rio Paragua, a  tributary stream of the Carony, into a lake called Cassipa, on account  of the Cassipagotos,* who lived in those countries. (* Raleigh pages  64 and 69. I always quote, when the contrary is not expressly said,  the original edition of 1596. Have these tribes of Cassipagtos,  Epuremei, and"]]]
