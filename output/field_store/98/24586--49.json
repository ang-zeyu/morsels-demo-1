Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house she was  a teeny-tiny bit tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her  teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny cupboard.  And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny-tiny time, she  was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard, which  said:    \"Give me my bone!\"    And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid her  teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes and went to sleep again.  And when she had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny  voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny louder,  \"Give me my bone!\"    This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so she hid  her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny clothes.  And when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny  time, the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard said again a  teeny-tiny louder,    \"Give me my bone!\"    And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened, but she  put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in her  loudest teeny-tiny voice, \"TAKE IT!\"          JACK AND THE BEANSTALK    There was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named Jack,  and a cow named Milky-white. And all they had to live on was the milk  the cow gave every morning which they carried to the market and sold.  But one morning Milky-white gave no milk and they didn't know what to  do.    \"What shall we do, what shall we do?\" said the widow, wringing her  hands.    \"Cheer up, mother, I'll go and get work somewhere,\" said Jack.    \"We've tried that before, and nobody would take you,\" said his mother;  \"we must sell Milky-white and with the money do something, start shop,  or something.\"    \"All right, mother,\" says Jack; \"it's market-day today, and I'll soon  sell Milky-white, and then we'll see what we can do.\"    So he took the cow's halter in his hand, and off he starts. He hadn't  gone far when he met a funny-looking old man who said to him: \"Good  morning, Jack.\"    \"Good morning to you,\" said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name.    \"Well, Jack, and where are you off to?\" said the man.    \"I'm going to market to sell our cow here.\"    \"Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows,\" said the man; \"I  wonder if you know how many beans make five.\"    \"Two in each hand and one in your mouth,\" says Jack, as sharp as a  needle.    \"Right you are,\" said the man, \"and here they are the very beans  themselves,\" he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of  strange-looking beans. \"As you are so sharp,\" says he, \"I don't mind  doing a swop with you--your cow for these beans.\"    \"Walker!\" says Jack; \"wouldn't you like it?\"    \"Ah! you don't know what these beans are,\" said the man; \"if you plant  them over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky.\"    \"Really?\" says Jack; \"you don't say so.\"    \"Yes, that is so, and if it doesn't turn out to be true you can have  your cow back.\"    \"Right,\" says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white's halter and pockets  the beans.    Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn't gone very far it wasn't dusk by  the time he got to his door.    \"What back, Jack?\" said his mother; \"I see you haven't got Milky-white,  so you've sold her. How much did you get for her?\"    \"You'll never guess, mother,\" says Jack.    \"No, you don't say so. Good boy! Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it can't  be twenty.\"    \"I told you you couldn't guess, what do you say to these beans; they're  magical, plant them over-night and----\"    \"What!\" says Jack's mother, \"have you been such a fool, such a dolt,  such an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the  parish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans. Take that!  Take that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out of  the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink, and  not a bit shall you swallow this very night.\"    So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and sorry  he was, to be sure, as much for his mother's sake, as for the loss of  his supper.    At last he dropped off to sleep.    When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was shining into part  of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady. So Jack jumped  up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you think  he saw? why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the  garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up  till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all.    The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack's window, so all he had to  do was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made  like a big plaited ladder. So Jack climbed and he climbed and he climbed  and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last  he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long broad road  going as straight as a dart. So he walked along and he walked along  and he walked along till he came to a great big tall house, and on the  doorstep there was a great big tall woman.    \"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, quite polite-like. \"Could you be so kind  as to give me some breakfast.\" For he hadn't had anything to eat, you  know, the night before and was as hungry as a hunter.    \"It's breakfast you want, is it?\" says the great big tall woman, \"it's  breakfast you'll be if you don't move off from here. My man is an ogre  and there's nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast. You'd  better be moving on or he'll soon be coming.\"    \"Oh! please mum, do give me something to eat, mum. I've had nothing to  eat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,\" says Jack. \"I may  as well be broiled, as die of hunger.\"    Well, the ogre's wife wasn't such a bad sort, after all. So she took  Jack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug  of milk. But Jack hadn't half finished these when thump! thump! thump!  the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone coming.    \"Goodness gracious me! It's my old man,\" said the ogre's wife, \"what on  earth shall I do? Here, come quick and jump in here.\" And she bundled  Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.    He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he had three calves strung up  by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and  said: \"Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah what's  this I smell?      Fee-fi-fo-fum,    I smell the blood of an Englishman,    Be he alive, or be he dead    I'll have his bones to grind my bread.\"    \"Nonsense, dear,\" said his wife, \"you're dreaming. Or perhaps you smell  the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday's dinner.  Here, go you and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you come back  your breakfast'll be ready for you.\"    So the ogre went off, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven  and run off when the woman told him not. \"Wait till he's asleep,\" says  she; \"he always has a snooze after breakfast.\"    Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big chest  and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down counting them  till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole  house shook again.    Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the  ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters  till he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold  which of course fell in to his mother's garden, and then he climbed down  and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed  her the gold and said: \"Well, mother, wasn't I right about the beans.  They are really magical, you see.\"    So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came to  the end of that so Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at  the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he got up early, and got  on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and  he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he got on the road  again and came to the great big tall house he had been to before. There,  sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing on the door-step.    \"Good morning, mum,\" says Jack, as bold as brass, \"could you be so good  as to give me something to eat?\"    \"Go away, my boy,\" said the big, tall woman, \"or else my man will eat  you up for breakfast. But aren't you the youngster who came here once  before? Do you know, that very day, my man missed one of his bags of  gold.\"    \"That's strange, mum,\" says Jack, \"I dare say I could tell you something  about that but I'm so hungry I can't speak till I've had something to  eat.\"    Well the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave  him something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as  he could when thump! thump! thump! they heard the giant's footstep, and  his wife hid Jack away in the oven.    All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before, said:  \"Fee-fi-fo-fum,\" and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen. Then he  said: \"Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.\" So she brought  it, and the ogre said: \"Lay,\" and it laid an egg all of gold. And then  the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the house shook.    Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden  hen, and was off before you could say \"Jack Robinson.\" But this time the  hen gave a cackle"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7440"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#8)"],[1,"obtained it  of GOD, and the camel was immediately delivered of a young one ready weaned;  but they, instead of believing, cut the hamstrings of the camel and killed  her; at which act of impiety GOD, being highly displeased, three days after  struck them dead in their houses by an earthquake and a terrible noise from  heaven, which, some7 say, was the voice of Gabriel the archangel crying aloud,  \"Die, all of you.\"  Sâleh, with those who were reformed by him, were saved  from this destruction; the prophet going into Palestine, and from thence to  Mecca,8 where he ended his days.     This tribe first dwelt in Yaman, but being expelled thence by Hamyar the  son of Sâba,9 they settled in the territory of Hejr in the province of Hejâz,  where their habitations cut out of the rocks, mentioned in the Korân,10 are  still to be seen, and also the crack of the rock whence the camel issued,  which, as an eye-witness11 hath declared, is 60 cubits wide.  These houses of  the Thamûdites being of the ordinary proportion, are used as an argument to  convince those of a mistake who who this people to have been of a gigantic  stature.12     The tragical destructions of these two potent tribes are often insisted on  in the Korân, as instances of GOD'S judgment on obstinate unbelievers.     The tribe of Tasm were the posterity of Lûd the son of Sem, and Jadîs of  the descendants of Jether.1  These two tribes dwelt promiscuously together  under the government of Tasm, till a certain tyrant made a law that no maid of  the tribe of Jadîs should marry unless first defloured by him;2 which the  Jadisians not enduring, formed a conspiracy, and inviting the king and chiefs  of Tasm to an entertainment, privately hid their swords in the sand, and in  the midst of their mirth fell on them and slew them all, and extirpated the  greatest part of that tribe; however, the few who escaped obtaining aid of the  king of Yaman, then (as is said) Dhu Habshân Ebn Akrân,3 assaulted the Jadîs  and utterly destroyed them, there being scarce any mention made from that time  of either of these tribes.4     The former tribe of Jorham (whose ancestor some pretend was one of the  eighty persons saved in the ark of Noah, according to a Mohammedan tradition5)  was contemporary with Ad, and utterly perished.6  The tribe of Amalek were  descended from Amalek the son of Eliphaz the son of Esau 7, though some of the  oriental authors say Amalek was the son of Ham the son of Noah,8 and others  the son of Azd the son of Sem.9  The posterity of this person rendered  themselves very powerful,10 and before the time of Joseph conquered the lower  Egypt under       5  D'Herbel.

The posterity of Ismael have no claim to be admitted as pure Arabs, their  ancestor being by origin and language an Hebrew; but having made an alliance  with the Jorhamites, by marrying a daughter of Modad, and accustomed himself  to their manner of living and language, his descendants became blended with  them into one nation.  The uncertainty of the descents between Ismael and  Adnân is the reason why they seldom trace their genealogies higher than the  latter, whom they acknowledge as father of their tribes, the descents from him  downwards being pretty certain and uncontroverted.1     The genealogy of these tribes being of great use to illustrate the Arabian  history, I have taken the pains to form a genealogical table from their most  approved authors, to which I refer the curious.     Besides these tribes of Arabs mentioned by their own authors, who were all  descended from the race of Sem, others of them were the posterity of Ham by  his son Cush, which name is in scripture constantly given to the Arabs and  their country, though our version renders it Ethiopia; but strictly speaking,  the Cushites did not inhabit Arabia properly so called, but the banks of the  Euphrates and the Persian Gulf, whither they came form Chuzestân or Susiana,  the original settlement of their father.2  They might probably mix themselves  in process of time with the Arabs of the other race, but the eastern writers  take little or no notice of them.     The Arabians were for some centuries under the government of the  descendants of Kâhtan; Yárab, one of his sons, founding the kingdom of Yaman,  and Jorham, another of them, that of Hejâz.     The province of Yaman, or the better part of it, particularly the provinces  of Saba and Hadramaut, was governed by princes of the tribe of Hamyar, though  at length the kingdom was translated to the descendants of Cahlân, his  brother, who yet retained the title of king of Hamyar, and had all of them the  general title of Tobba, which signifies successor, and was affected to this  race of princes, as that of       11  Mirât Caïnât.  12  Vide Joseph. cont. Apion. l. i. 13  Vide  Exod. xvii. 18, &c.; I Sam. xv. 2, &c.; ibid. xxvii. 8, 9; I Chron. iv. 43.   14  R. Saad. in vers. Arab. Pentat. Gen. x. 25.  Some writers make  Kahtân a descendant of Ismael, but against the current of oriental historians.  See Poc. Spec. 39.  15  An expression something like that of St.  Paul, who calls himself \"an Hebrew of the Hebrews,\" Philip. iii. 5.   1  Poc. Spec. p. 40. 2  Vide Hyde Hist. Rel. veter. Persar. p. 37,  &c.            Cæsar was to the Roman emperors, and Khalîf to the successors of Mohammed.  There were several lesser princes who reigned in other parts of Yaman, and  were mostly, if not altogether, subject to the king of Hamyar, whom they  called the great king, but of these history has recorded nothing remarkable or  that may be depended upon.1     The first great calamity that befell the tribes settled in Yaman was the  inundation of Aram, which happened soon after the time of Alexander the Great,  and is famous in the Arabian history.  No less than eight tribes were forced  to abandon their dwellings upon this occasion, some of which gave rise to the  two kingdoms of Ghassân and Hira.  And this was probably the time of the  migration of those tribes or colonies which were led into Mesopotamia by three  chiefs,Becr, Modar, and Rabîa, from whom the three provinces of that country  are still named Diyar Becr, Diyar Modar, and Diyar Rabîa.2  Abdshems, surnamed  Saba, having built the city from him called Saba, and afterwards Mareb, made a  vast mound, or dam,3 to serve as a basin or reservoir to receive the water  which came down from the mountains, not only for the use of the inhabitants,  and watering their lands, but also to keep the country they had subjected in  greater awe by being masters of the water.  This building stood like a  mountain above their city, and was by them esteemed so strong that they were  in no apprehension of its ever failing.  The water rose to the height of  almost twenty fathoms, and was kept in on every side by a work so solid, that  many of the inhabitants had their houses built upon it.  Every family had a  certain portion of this water, distributed by aqueducts.  But at length, GOD,  being highly displeased at their great pride and insolence, and resolving to  humble and disperse them, sent a mighty flood, which broke down the mound by  night while the inhabitants were asleep, and carried away the whole city, with  the neighbouring towns and people.4     The tribes which remained in Yaman after this terrible devastation still  continued under the obedience of the former princes, till about seventy years  before Mohammed, when the king of Ethiopia sent over forces to assist the  Christians of Yaman against the cruel persecution of their king, Dhu Nowâs, a  bigoted Jew, whom they drove to that extremity that he forced his horse into  the sea, and so lost his life and crown,5 after which the country was governed  by four Ethiopian princes successively, till Selif, the son of Dhu Yazan, of  the tribe of Hamyar, obtaining succours from Khosrû Anushirwân, king of  Persia, which had been denied him by the emperor Heraclius, recovered the  throne and drove out the Ethiopians, but was himself slain by some of them who  were left behind.  The Persians appointed the succeeding princes till Yaman  fell into the hands of Mohammed, to whom Bazan, or rather Badhân, the last of  them, submitted, and embraced this new religion.1     This kingdom of the Hammyarites is said to have lasted 2,020 years,2 or as  others say above 3,000;3 the length of"]]]
