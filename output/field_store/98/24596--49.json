La gxardeno de la viroj, the garden of the men (the men's garden).                                 IMPERSONAL VERBS.    50. Verbs with an impersonal or indeterminate subject, as \"it rains,\"  \"it is snowing,\" are called impersonal, because there is no actual  subject, the word \"it\" serving merely as an introductory particle. No  such particle is used with impersonal verbs in Esperanto:       Pluvas, it rains, it is raining.     Negxis hieraux, it snowed yesterday.                          VERBS PRECEDING THEIR SUBJECTS.    51. When the verb in a sentence precedes its subject, English often uses  an introductory particle, such as \"there,\" \"it.\" In Esperanto no such  particles are needed:       Estas floroj sur la tablo, there are flowers on the table.     Estis Johano, ne Alfredo, en la gxardeno,        it was John, not Alfred, in the garden.     Estas domo en la kampo, there is a house in the field.     Estis mi, it was I.                             COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS.    52. Words like \"aux\", \"kaj\", \"nek\", \"sed\", which join words,  word-groups, or sentences together are conjunctions. All the  conjunctions given so far connect words, phrases, or sentences of  similar rank or kind. These are called coordinating conjunctions,  and the words, phrases, or sentences connected by them are said  to be coordinate:       Cxu vi marsxas aux kuras?     (\"Aux\" connects the verbs.)       Sxi iris, kaj ni estis felicxaj.     (\"Kaj\" connects the sentences.)       Nek vi nek mi vidis gxin.     (The second \"nek\" connects the pronouns,     the first being introductory and adverbial.)       Aux li aux sxi perdis la libron.     (The second \"aux\" connects the pronouns,     the first being introductory and adverbial.)       Gxi falis sur la segxon, sed ne sur la plankon.     (\"Sed\" connects the phrases.)       Li ne sxatis gxin. Tamen li tenis gxin.     (\"Tamen\" connects the sentences.)    [Footnote: A phrase is a word-group forming an expression, but not  containing a verb, as \"through the house,\" \"of the man,\" \"before me,\"  etc.]    [Footnote: Coordinating conjunctions may be further classified according  to their meaning: \"Aux\" is disjunctive, connecting alternates, and  expressing separation. \"Kaj\" is copulative, expressing union. \"Nek\"  is disjunctive, expressing separation and also negation. \"Sed\" is  adversative, expressing opposition, contrast, or modification of a  previous statement. \"Tamen\" is adversative, affirming something in spite  of a previous objection or concession. \"Do,\" \"so, then, consequently,\"  is argumentative, expressing a logical inference or result in a somewhat  conversational manner.]                                     VOCABULARY       akvo = water.                      porti = to carry.     amiko = friend.                    ricxa = rich, wealthy.     ankaux = also.                     sablo = sand.     bezoni = to need.                  sako = sack, bag.     dezerto = desert.                  seka = dry.     fidela = faithful.                 tamen = nevertheless.     mono = money.                      trinki = to drink.     negxi = to snow.                   veni = to come.     pluvi = to rain.                   vojo = road, way.                              LA ARABO EN LA DEZERTO.    Arabo iris trans grandan sekan dezerton. Kamelo, lia fidela amiko,  portis lin. La kamelo ankaux portis belajn tapisxojn, cxar la arabo  estis ricxa viro. La arabo havis ne nur tapisxojn, sed ankaux sakojn. En  la sakoj estis akvo, cxar en la dezerto nek pluvas nek negxas. La viro  trinkis akvon, kaj ankaux donis akvon al sia kamelo. La kamelo marsxis  kaj marsxis, sed ne venis al la domo de la arabo, cxar ili perdis la  vojon. La suno brilis, kaj la sablo de la dezerto sxajnis varma. La  arabo ne trovis la vojon, kaj baldaux li ne havis akvon. Tamen la kamelo  marsxis kaj marsxis, kaj baldaux la arabo vidis sakon antaux si, sur la  seka sablo. Li estis felicxa kaj diris al si \"Cxu estas akvo en gxi?  Mi volas trinki, kaj volas doni akvon al mia fidela kamelo.\" Li ankaux  volis lavi la tutan vizagxon en la akvo, cxar li estis varma. Post sia  diro li kaptis la sakon, kaj komencis rigardi en gxin. Li metis la nazon  en gxin, sed ne trovis akvon en la sako. Nek li nek lia fidela kamelo  havis akvon, cxar estis nur mono en la sako. La arabo estis kolera, cxar  li ne volis monon, li bezonis akvon. Li havis monon en sia domo en la  urbo, kaj volis trovi akvon. Cxu li tamen metis la sakon trans la kolon  de sia kamelo? Ne, li ne volis meti gxin sur sian kamelon, cxar li estis  kolera. Li ne tenis la sakon, sed gxi falis sur la sablon, kaj kusxis  apud li. La sako nun kusxas sur la sablo de la granda dezerto, kaj la  mono estas en gxi.                             SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION.    1. Today it is raining, but yesterday it was snowing. 2.

A statement made indirectly by means of a clause dependent upon a  verb meaning \"say,\" \"think,\" \"know,\" \"believe,\" or a similar expression,  as in \"I know that he came,\" \"I hear that he is good,\" is called an  \"indirect statement.\" (The \"direct\" statement is \"he came,\" \"he is  good.\") An indirect statement is joined to the main verb or sentence by  the subordinating conjunction \"ke,\" that.       Johano diras ke vi venis hieraux,        John says that you came yesterday.     Sxi opinias ke estas mono en la sako,        she thinks that there is money in the bag.    [Footnote: A clause is a group of words including a verb, which is  dependent upon or subordinate to a main verb or sentence, as \"--that he  came,\" \"--when he went,\" \"--that he is good,\" etc.]    [Footnote: In English the subordinating conjunction may sometimes be  omitted, either \"I think that he is good,\" or \"I think he is good,\"  being usually permissible. But in Esperanto there is no variation, and  the conjunction \"ke\" is never omitted.]                       THE INDEFINITE PERSONAL PRONOUN \"ONI\".    54. When an indefinite personal pronoun is desired, as in the  expressions \"one knows,\" \"they say,\" \"people say,\" \"you can see,\" etc.,  the indefinite personal pronoun \"oni\" is used. This pronoun may also be  used in translating such expressions as \"it is said,\" \"I am told,\" etc.:       Oni diras ke li estas ricxa, they say (one says) that he is rich.     Oni vidas ke ili estas amikoj, one sees that they are friends.     Mi opinias ke oni sxatas lin,        I think that people like him (that he is liked).     Oni diris al mi ke estas sablo en la dezerto,        I was told (people said to me) that there is sand in the desert.     Oni opinias ke sxi estas felicxa,        it is thought (one thinks) that she is happy.     Cxu oni vidis nin en la gxardeno?        Were we seen (did people see us) in the garden?     Oni sxatas agrablajn infanojn,        people like agreeable children (agreeable children are liked).                                 THE FUTURE TENSE.    55. The future tense of the verb expresses an act or state as about to  take place, or as one that will take place in future time. The ending of  this tense is \"-os,\" as \"kuros,\" will run, \"flugos,\" will fly, \"brilos,\"  will shine. The conjugation of \"esti\" and also of \"vidi\" in the future  tense is as follows:       mi estos = I shall be.             mi vidos = I shall see.     vi estos = you will be.            vi vidos = you will see.     li (sxi, gxi) estos =              li (sxi, gxi) vidos :        he (she, it) will be.              he (she, it) will see.     ni estos = we shall be.            ni vidos = we shall see.     vi estos = you (plural) will be.   vi vidos = you (plural) will see.     ili estos = they will be.          ili vidos = they will see.                                     VOCABULARY       auxdi = to hear.                   oni = (see 54).     blovi = to blow.                   opinii = to think, to opine.     greno = grain (wheat, corn, etc.). orienta = east, eastern.     ke = that (conjunction).           pluvo = rain.     kontraux = against.                suda = south, southern.     montri = to show, to point out.    velki = to wilt, to wither.     norda = north, northern.           vento = wind.     nova = new.                        ventoflago = weathercock.     okcidenta = west, western.         vetero = weather.                                   LA VENTOFLAGO.    Estis varma vetero, la suno brilis, kaj suda vento blovis. Tamen la  nova ventoflago sur la domo diris al si, \"La sudan venton mi ne sxatas.  Mi preferas orientan venton.\" La vento orienta auxdis la diron kaj gxi  venis kontraux la ventoflagon. Pluvis kaj pluvis, kaj oni estis kolera  kontraux la ventoflago, cxar gxi montras orientan venton. Gxi diris,  \"Pluvas nun, sed la greno en la kampoj bezonos sekan veteron. Oni estos  kolera kontraux mi, cxar mi montras orientan venton.\" La "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/779"],[0,"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#8)"],[1," ourselves that Helen of Greece was the admirablest       lady that ever lived:  therefore, Master Doctor, if you will do us       that favour, as to let us see that peerless dame of Greece, whom       all the world admires for majesty, we should think ourselves much       beholding unto you.         FAUSTUS. Gentlemen,       For that I know your friendship is unfeign'd,       And Faustus' custom is not to deny       The just requests of those that wish him well,       You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece,       No otherways for pomp and majesty       Than when Sir Paris cross'd the seas with her,       And brought the spoils to rich Dardania.       Be silent, then, for danger is in words.            [Music sounds, and HELEN passeth over the stage.[153]]         SECOND SCHOLAR. Too simple is my wit to tell her praise,       Whom all the world admires for majesty.         THIRD SCHOLAR. No marvel though the angry Greeks pursu'd       With ten years' war the rape of such a queen,       Whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare.         FIRST SCHOLAR. Since we have seen the pride of Nature's works,       And only paragon of excellence,       Let us depart; and for this glorious deed       Happy and blest be Faustus evermore!         FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  the same I wish to you.            [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]              Enter an OLD MAN.[154]         OLD MAN. Ah, Doctor Faustus, that I might prevail       To guide thy steps unto the way of life,       By which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal       That shall conduct thee to celestial rest!       Break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears,       Tears falling from repentant heaviness       Of thy most vile[155] and loathsome filthiness,       The stench whereof corrupts the inward soul       With such flagitious crimes of heinous sin[156]       As no commiseration may expel,       But mercy, Faustus, of thy Saviour sweet,       Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt.         FAUSTUS. Where art thou, Faustus? wretch, what hast thou done?       Damn'd art thou, Faustus, damn'd; despair and die!       Hell calls for right, and with a roaring voice       Says, \"Faustus, come; thine hour is almost[157] come;\"       And Faustus now[158] will come to do thee right.            [MEPHISTOPHILIS gives him a dagger.]         OLD MAN. Ah, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!       I see an angel hovers o'er thy head,       And, with a vial full of precious grace,       Offers to pour the same into thy soul:       Then call for mercy, and avoid despair.         FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet friend, I feel       Thy words to comfort my distressed soul!       Leave me a while to ponder on my sins.         OLD MAN. I go, sweet Faustus; but with heavy cheer,       Fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul.            [Exit.]         FAUSTUS. Accursed Faustus, where is mercy now?       I do repent; and yet I do despair:       Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:       What shall I do to shun the snares of death?         MEPHIST. Thou traitor, Faustus, I arrest thy soul       For disobedience to my sovereign lord:       Revolt, or I'll in piece-meal tear thy flesh.         FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, entreat thy lord       To pardon my unjust presumption,       And with my blood again I will confirm       My former vow I made to Lucifer.         MEPHIST. Do it, then, quickly,[159] with unfeigned heart,       Lest greater danger do attend thy drift.         FAUSTUS. Torment, sweet friend, that base and crooked age,       That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer,       With greatest torments that our hell affords.         MEPHIST. His faith is great; I cannot touch his soul;       But what I may afflict his body with       I will attempt, which is but little worth.         FAUSTUS. One thing, good servant,[160] let me crave of thee,       To glut the longing of my heart's desire,--       That I might have unto my paramour       That heavenly Helen which I saw of late,       Whose sweet embracings may extinguish clean       Those[161] thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow,       And keep mine oath I made to Lucifer.         MEPHIST. Faustus, this,[162] or what else thou shalt desire,       Shall be perform'd in twinkling of an eye.              Re-enter HELEN.         FAUSTUS. Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,       And burnt the topless[163] towers of Ilium--       Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.--            [Kisses her.]       Her lips suck forth my soul:  see, where it flies!--       Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.       Here will I dwell, for heaven is[164] in these lips,       And all is dross that is not Helena.       I will be Paris, and for love of thee,       Instead of Troy, shall Wertenberg be sack'd;       And I will combat with weak Menelaus,       And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;       Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,       And then return to Helen for a kiss.       O, thou art fairer than the evening air       Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;       Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter       When he appear'd to hapless Semele;       More lovely than the monarch of the sky       In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms;       And none but thou shalt[165] be my paramour!            [Exeunt.]              Enter the OLD MAN.[166]         OLD MAN. Accursed Faustus, miserable man,       That from thy soul exclud'st the grace of heaven,       And fly'st the throne of his tribunal-seat!              Enter DEVILS.         Satan begins to sift me with his pride:       As in this furnace God shall try my faith,       My faith, vile hell, shall triumph over thee.       Ambitious fiends, see how the heavens smile       At your repulse, and laugh your state to scorn!       Hence, hell! for hence I fly unto my God.            [Exeunt,--on one side, DEVILS, on the other, OLD MAN.]              Enter FAUSTUS,[167] with SCHOLARS.         FAUSTUS. Ah, gentlemen!         FIRST SCHOLAR. What ails Faustus?         FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had I lived with thee,       then had I lived still! but now I die eternally.  Look, comes       he not? comes he not?         SECOND SCHOLAR. What means Faustus?         THIRD SCHOLAR. Belike he is grown into some sickness by being       over-solitary.         FIRST SCHOLAR. If it be so, we'll have physicians to cure him.       --'Tis but a surfeit; never fear, man.         FAUSTUS. A surfeit of deadly sin, that hath damned both body       and soul.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, look up to heaven; remember God's       mercies are infinite.         FAUSTUS. But Faustus' offence can ne'er be pardoned:  the serpent       that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus.  Ah, gentlemen,       hear me with patience, and tremble not at my speeches!  Though       my heart pants and quivers to remember that I have been a student       here these thirty years, O, would I had never seen Wertenberg,       never read book! and what wonders I have done, all Germany can       witness, yea, all the world; for which Faustus hath lost both       Germany and the world, yea, heaven itself, heaven, the seat of       God, the throne of the blessed, the kingdom of joy; and must       remain in hell for ever, hell, ah, hell, for ever!  Sweet friends,       what shall become of Faustus, being in hell for ever?         THIRD SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, call on God.         FAUSTUS. On God, whom Faustus hath abjured! on God, whom Faustus       hath blasphemed!  Ah, my God, I would weep! but the devil draws in       my tears.  Gush forth blood, instead of tears! yea, life and soul!       O, he stays my tongue!  I would lift up my hands; but see, they       hold them, they hold them!         ALL. Who, Faustus?         FAUSTUS. Lucifer and Mephistophilis.  Ah, gentlemen, I gave them       my soul for my cunning![168]         ALL. God forbid!         FAUSTUS. God forbade it, indeed; but Faustus hath done it:  for       vain pleasure of twenty-four years hath Faustus lost eternal joy       and felicity.  I writ them a bill with mine own blood:  the date       is expired; the time will come, and he will fetch me.         FIRST SCHOLAR. Why did not Faustus tell us of this before,[169]       that divines might have prayed for thee?         FAUSTUS. Oft have I thought to have done so; but the devil       threatened to tear me in pieces, if I named God, to fetch both       body and soul, if I once gave ear to divinity:  and now 'tis too       late.  Gentlemen, away, lest you perish with me.         SECOND SCHOLAR. O, what shall we do to save[170] Faustus?         FAUSTUS. Talk not of me, but save yourselves, and depart.         THIRD SCHOLAR. God will strengthen me; I will stay with Faustus.         FIRST SCHOLAR. Tempt not God, sweet friend; but let us into the       next room, and there pray for him.         FAUSTUS. Ay, pray for me, pray for me; and what noise soever       ye hear,[171] come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.         SECOND SCHOLAR. Pray thou, and we will pray that God may have       mercy upon thee.         FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  if I live till morning, I'll visit       you; if not, Faustus is gone to hell.         ALL. Faustus, farewell.            [Exeunt SCHOLARS.--The clock strikes eleven.]         FAUSTUS. Ah, Faustus,       Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,       And then thou must be damn'd perpetually!       Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,       That time may cease, and midnight never come;       Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make       Perpetual day; or let this hour be but       A year, a month, a week, a natural day,       That Faustus may repent and save his soul!       O lente,[172] lente currite, noctis equi!       The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,       The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd.       O, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?--       See, see,"]]]
