At any rate, he rescued the colors of a white regiment from unseemly  trampling and bore them safely through the bullets to the top of  San Juan hill. Now, every one knows that the standard of a troop is  guarded like a man's own soul, or should be, and how it came that this  Third Cavalry banner was lying on the ground that day is something  that may never be rightly known. Some white man had left it there,  many white men had let it stay there, but Berry, a black man, saw it  fluttering in shame and paused in his running long enough to catch  it up and lift it high overhead beside his own banner--for he was a  color-bearer of the Tenth.\"    \"Then, with two flags flying above him, and two heavy staves to bear,  this powerful negro (he is literally a giant in strength and stature)  charged the heights, while white men and black men cheered him as they  pressed behind. Who shall say what temporary demoralization there may  have been in this troop of the Third at that critical moment, or what  fresh courage may have been fired in them by that black man's act!  They say Berry yelled like a demon as he rushed against the Spaniards,  and I, for one, am willing to believe that his battle-cry brought  fighting energy to his own side as well as terror to the enemy.\"    \"After the fight one of the officers of the Third Cavalry sought Berry  out and asked him to give back the trophy fairly won by him, and his  to keep, according to the usages of war. And the big Negro handed back  the banner with a smile and light word. He had saved the colors and  rallied the troop, but it didn't matter much. They could have the flag  if they wanted it.\"    \"There are some hundreds of little things like this that we might as  well bear in mind, we white men, the next time we start out to decry  the Negro!\"           *       *       *       *       *    PRESIDENT MCKINLEY RECOGNIZES THE WORTH OF NEGRO SOLDIERS BY  PROMOTION.    PROMOTIONS FOR COLORED SOLDIERS.    Washington, July 30.--Six colored non-commissioned officers who  rendered particularly gallant service in the actions around Santiago  on July 1st and 2d have been appointed second lieutenants in the two  colored immune regiments recently organized under special act of  Congress. These men are Sergeants William Washington, Troop F, and  John C. Proctor, Troop I, of the 9th Cavalry, and Sergeants William  McBryar, Company H; Wyatt Hoffman, Company G; Macon Russell, Company  H, and Andrew J. Smith, Company B, of the 25th Infantry, commanded by  Colonel Daggett. Jacob C. Smith, Sergeant Pendergrass, Lieutenant Ray,  Sergeant Horace W. Bivins, Lieutenant E.L. Baker, Lieutenant J.H.  Hill, Lieutenant Buck.--_N.Y. World._    These promotions were made into the volunteer regiments, which were  mustered out after the war, thus leaving the men promoted in the same  rank they were before promotion if they chose to re-enlist in the  regular army. They got no permanent advancement by this act of the  President, but the future may develop better things for them.           *       *       *       *       *    COMPETENT TO BE OFFICERS--THE VERDICT OF GENERAL THOMAS J.

COLOR LINE IN THE ARMY--DIFFICULTY IN MAKING AFRO-AMERICAN COMMISSIONED  OFFICERS--HEROISM ON THE FIELD SURE TO REAP REWARD--MORGAN PREFERS  NEGRO TROOP TO THE WHITES.    General Thomas J. Morgan belongs to that class of Caucasian observers  who are able to think clearly upon the Negro problem in all of its  phases, and who have not only the breadth of intelligence to form just  and generous opinions, but who possess that rarer quality, the courage  to give them out openly to the country. General Morgan contributes the  following article to the _New York Independent_, analyzing the motives  which underlie the color line in the army.    [Illustration: GENERAL, THOMAS J. MORGAN, LL.D., Who says Negroes are  Competent to be Officers in the Army.]    He has had wide experience in military affairs, and his close contact  with Negro soldiers during the civil war entitles him to speak with  authority. General Morgan says:    \"The question of the color line has assumed an acute stage, and has  called forth a good deal of feeling. The various Negro papers in the  country are very generally insisting that if the Negro soldiers are to  be enlisted, Negro officers should be appointed to command them. One  zealous paper is clamoring for the appointment, immediately, by the  President, of a Negro Major-General. The readers of _The Independent_  know very well that during the civil war there were enlisted in the  United States army 200,000 Negro soldiers under white officers, the  highest position assigned to a black man being that of first sergeant,  or of regimental sergeant-major. The Negroes were allowed to wear  chevrons, but not shoulder straps or epaulets. Although four Negro  regiments have been incorporated in the regular army, and have  rendered exceptionally effective service on the plains and elsewhere  for a whole generation, there are to-day no Negro officers in the  service. A number of young men have been appointed as cadets at West  Point, but the life has not been by any means an easy one. The only  caste or class with caste distinctions that exists in the republic is  found in the army; army officers are, par excellence, the aristocrats;  nowhere is class feeling so much cultivated as among them; nowhere  is it so difficult to break down the established lines. Singularly  enough, though entrance to West Point is made very broad, and a large  number of those who go there to be educated at the expense of the  Government have no social position to begin with, and no claims to  special merit, and yet, after having been educated at the public  expense, and appointed to life positions, they seem to cherish the  feeling that they are a select few, entitled to special consideration,  and that they are called upon to guard their class against any  insidious invasions. Of course there are honorable exceptions. There  are many who have been educated at West Point who are broad in their  sympathies, democratic in their ideas, and responsive to every appeal  of philanthropy and humanity; but the spirit of West Point has been  opposed to the admission of Negroes into the ranks of commissioned  officers, and the opposition to the commissioning of black men  emanating from the army will go very far toward the defeat of any  project of that kind.\"    \"To make the question of the admission of Negroes into the higher  ranks of commissioned officers more difficult is the fact that the  organization of Negro troops under the call of the President for  volunteers to carry on the war with Spain, has been left chiefly to  the Governors of states. Very naturally the strong public sentiment  against the Negro, which obtains almost universally in the South,  has thus far prevented the recognition of his right to be treated  precisely as the white man is treated. It would be, indeed, almost  revolutionary for any Southern Governor to commission a Negro as a  colonel of a regiment, or even a captain of a company. (Since this was  written two Negro colonels have been appointed--in the Third North  Carolina and Eighth Illinois.) Even where there are exceptions to this  rule, they are notable exceptions. Everywhere through the South Negro  volunteers are made to feel that they are not upon the same plane as  white volunteers.\"    \"In a recent conversation with the Adjutant General of the army, I  was assured by him that in the organization of the ten regiments of  immunes which Congress has authorized, the President had decided that  five of them should be composed of Negroes, and that while the field  and staff officers and captains are to be white, the lieutenants may  be Negroes. If this is done it will mark a distinct step in advance of  any taken hitherto. It will recognize partially, at least, the manhood  of the Negro, and break down that unnatural bar of separation now  existing. If a Negro is a lieutenant, he will command his company in  the absence of the captain. He can wear epaulets, and be entitled to  all the rights and privileges 'of an officer and a gentleman;' he is  no longer doomed to inferiority. In case of battle, where bullets "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#9)"],[1,"frequently be antagonistic to those to which her husband  belongs. This will introduce into the family circle new elements  of disagreement and discord which will frequently end in unhappy  divisions, if not in separation or divorce. This must frequently occur  when she becomes an active politician, identified with a party which  is distasteful to her husband. On the other hand, if she unites with  her husband in party associations and votes with him on all occasions  so as not to disturb the harmony and happiness of the family, then the  ballot is of no service as it simply duplicates the vote of the male  on each side of the question and leaves the result the same.    Again, if the family is the unit of society, and the state is composed  of an aggregation of families, then it is important to society that  there be as many happy families as possible, and it becomes the duty  of man and woman alike to unite in the holy relations of matrimony.    As this is the only legal and proper mode of rendering obedience to  the early command to multiply and replenish the earth, whatever tends  to discourage the holy relation of matrimony is in disobedience of  this command, and any change which encourages such disobedience is  violative of the Divine law, and can not result in advantage to the  state. Before forming this relation it is the duty of young men who  have to take upon themselves the responsibilities of providing for and  protecting the family to select some profession or pursuit that is  most congenial to their tastes, and in which they will be most likely  to be successful; but this can not be permitted to the young ladies,  or if permitted it can not be practically carried out after matrimony.    As it might frequently happen that the young man had selected one  profession or pursuit, and the young lady another, the result would  be that after marriage she must drop the profession or pursuit of her  choice, and employ herself in the sacred duties of wife and mother at  home, and in rearing, educating, and elevating the family, while the  husband pursues the profession of his choice.    It may be said, however, that there is a class of young ladies who  do not choose to marry, and who select professions or avocations and  follow them for a livelihood. This is true, but this class, compared  with the number who unite in matrimony with the husbands of their  choice, is comparatively very small, and it is the duty of society to  encourage the increase of marriages rather than of celibacy. If the  larger number of females select pursuits or professions which require  them to decline marriage, society to that extent is deprived of the  advantage resulting from the increase of population by marriage.    It is said by those who have examined the question closely that the  largest number of divorces is now found in the communities where  the advocates of female suffrage are most numerous, and where the  individuality of woman as related to her husband, which such a  doctrine inculcates, is increased to the greatest extent.    If this be true, it is a strong plea in the interests of the family  and of society against granting the petition of the advocates of woman  suffrage.    After all, this is a local question, which properly belongs to the  different States of the Union, each acting for itself, and to the  Territories of the Union, when not acting in conflict with the laws of  the United States.    The fact that a State adopts the rule of female suffrage neither  increases nor diminishes its power in the Union, as the number of  Representatives in Congress to which each State is entitled and the  number of members in the electoral college appointed by each is  determined by its aggregate population and not by the proportion of  its voting population, so long as no race or class as defined by the  Constitution is excluded from the exercise of the right of suffrage.    Now, Mr. President, I shall make no apology for adding to what I have  said some extracts from an able and well-written volume, entitled  \"Letters from the Chimney Corner,\" written by a highly cultivated lady  of Chicago. This gifted lady has discussed the question with so much  clearness and force that I can make no mistake by substituting some  of the thoughts taken from her book for anything I might add on this  question. While discussing the relations of the sexes, and showing  that neither sex is of itself a whole, a unit, and that each requires  to be supplemented by the other before its true structural integrity  can be achieved, she adds:    Now, everywhere throughout nature, to the male and female ideal,  certain distinct powers and properties belong. The lines of  demarkation are not always clear, not always straight lines: they are  frequently wavering, shadowy, and difficult to follow, yet on the  whole whatever physical strength, personal aggressiveness, the  intellectual scope and vigor which manage vast material enterprises  are emphasized, there the masculine ideal is present. On the other  hand, wherever refinement, tenderness, delicacy, sprightliness,  spiritual acumen, and force, are to the fore, there the feminine ideal  is represented, and these terms will be found nearly enough for all  practical purposes to represent the differing endowments of actual men  and women. Different powers suggest different activities, and under  the division of labor here indicated the control of the state,  legislation, the power of the ballot, would seem to fall to the share  of man. Nor does this decision carry with it any injustice, any  robbery of just or natural right to woman.    In her hands is placed a moral and spiritual power far greater than  the power of the ballot. In her married or reproductive state the  forming and shaping of human souls in their most plastic period is her  destiny. Nor do her labors or her responsibilities end with infancy or  childhood. Throughout his entire course, from the cradle to the grave,  man is ever under the moral and spiritual influence and control of  woman. With this power goes a tremendous responsibility for its true  management and use. If woman shall ever rise to the full height of her  power and privileges in this direction, she will have enough of the  world's work upon her hands without attempting legislation.    It may be argued that the possession of civil power confers dignity,  and is of itself a re-enforcement of whatever natural power an  individual may possess; but the dignity of womanhood, when it is fully  understood and appreciated, needs no such re-enforcement, nor are the  peculiar needs of woman such as the law can reach.    Whenever laws are needed for the protection of her legal status and  rights, there has been found to be little difficulty in obtaining them  by means of the votes of men; but the deeper and more vital needs of  woman and of society are those which are outside altogether of the  pale of the law, and which can only be reached by the moral forces  lodged in the hands of woman herself, acting in an enlarged and  general capacity.    For instance, whenever a man or woman has been wronged in marriage the  law may indeed step in with a divorce, but does that divorce give back  to either party the dream of love, the happy home, the prattle of  children, and the sweet outlook for future years which were destroyed  by that wrong? It is not a legal power which is needed in this case;  it is a moral power which shall prevent the wrong, or, if committed,  shall induce penitence, forgiveness, a purer life, and the healing of  the wound.    This power has been lodged by the Creator in the hands of woman  herself, and if she has not been rightly trained to use it there is  no redress for her at the hands of the law. The law alone can never  compel men to respect the chastity of woman. They must first recognize  its value in themselves by living up to the high level of their duties  as maidens, wives, and mothers; they must impress men with the beauty  and sacredness of purity, and then whatever laws are necessary  and available for its protection will be easily obtained, with  a certainty, also, that they can be enforced, because the moral  sentiments of men will be enlisted in their support.    Privileges bring responsibilities, and before women clamor for more  work to do, it were better that they should attend more thoughtfully  to the duties which lie all about them, in the home and social circle.  Until society is cleansed of the moral foulness which infests it,  which, as we have seen, lies beyond the reach of civil law, women have  no call to go forth into wider fields, claiming to be therein the  rightful and natural purifiers. Let them first make the home sweet and  pure, and the streams which flow therefrom will sweeten and purify all  the rest.    As between the power of the ballot and this moral force exerted by  women there can not be an instant's doubt as to the choice. In natural  refinement and elevation of character, the ideal woman stands a step  above the ideal man. If she descends from this fortunate position to  take part in the coarse scramble for material power, what chance will  she have as against man's aggressive forces; and what can she possibly  gain that she can not win more directly, more effectually, and with  far more dignity and glory to herself by the exercise of her own  womanly prerogatives? She has, under God, the formation and rearing of  men in her own hands.    If they do not turn out in the end to be men who respect woman, who  will protect and defend her in the exercise of every one of her  God-given rights, it is because she has failed in her duty toward  them; has not been taught to comprehend her own power and to use it  to its best ends. For women to seek to control men by the power of  suffrage is like David essaying the armor of Saul. What woman needs is  her own sheepskin sling and her few smooth pebbles from the bed of"]]]
