Long ago, in Shakespeare's time, he boasted that he could \"put a  girdle round the earth in forty minutes.\" Men have been trying ever  since to catch up with him, but they have not gone ahead of him yet.    If, only three hundred years ago, this were the case, what must have  been Puck's fun, when he saw men in the early days, working so hard to  make even a clay cup or saucer. These people who slept and ate in cave  boarding-houses, knew nothing of metals, or how to make iron or brass  tools, wire, or machines, or how to touch a button and light up a  whole room, which even a baby can now do.    There is one thing that we, who have traveled in many fairy lands,  have often noticed and told our friends, the little folks, and that is  this:    All the fairies we ever knew are very slow to change either their  opinions, or their ways, or their fashions. Like many mortals, they  think a great deal of their own notions. They imagine that the only  way to do a thing is in that which they say is the right one.    So it came to pass that even when the Cymric folk gave up wearing the  skins of animals, and put on pretty clothes woven on a loom, and ate  out of dishes, instead of clam shells, there were still some fairies  that kept to the notions and fashions of the cave days. To one of  these, came trouble because of this failing.    Now there was once a pretty nymph, who lived in the Red Lake, to which  a young and handsome farmer used to come to catch fish. One misty day,  when the lad could see only a few feet before him, a wind cleared the  air and blew away the fog. Then he saw near him a little old man,  standing on a ladder. He was hard at work in putting a thatched roof  on a hut which he had built.    A few minutes later, as the mist rose and the breezes blew, the farmer  could see no house, but only the ripplings of water on the lake's  surface.    Although he went fishing often, he never again saw anything unusual,  during the whole summer.    On one hot day in the early autumn, while he stopped to let his horse  drink, he looked and saw a very lovely face on the water. Wondering to  whom it might belong, there rose up before him the head and shoulders  of a most beautiful woman. She was so pretty that he had two tumbles.  He fell off his horse and he fell in love with her at one and the same  time.    Rushing toward the lovely vision, he put out his arms at that spot  where he had seen her, but only to embrace empty air. Then he  remembered that love is blind. So he rubbed his eyes, to see if he  could discern anything. Yet though he peered down into the water, and  up over the hills, he could not see her anywhere.    But he soon found out to his joy that his eyes were all right, for in  another place, the face, flower-crowned hair, and her reflection in  the water came again. Then his desire to possess the damsel was  doubled. But again, she disappeared, to rise again somewhere else.    Five times he was thus tantalized and disappointed. She rose up, and  quickly disappeared.    It seemed as though she meant only to tease him. So he rode home  sorrowing, and scarcely slept that night.    Early morning, found the lovelorn youth again at the lake side, but  for hours he watched in vain. He had left his home too excited to have  eaten his usual breakfast, which greatly surprised his housekeeper.  Now he pulled out some sweet apples, which a neighbor had given him,  and began to munch them, while still keeping watch on the waters.    No sooner had the aroma of the apples fallen on the air, than the  pretty lady of the lake bobbed up from beneath the surface, and this  time quite near him. She seemed to have lost all fear, for she asked  him to throw her one of the apples.    \"Please come, pretty maid, and get it yourself,\" cried the farmer.  Then he held up the red apple, turning it round and round before her,  to tempt her by showing its glossy surface and rich color.    Apparently not afraid, she came up close to him and took the apple  from his left hand. At once, he slipped his strong right arm around  her waist, and hugged her tight. At this, she screamed loudly.    Then there appeared in the middle of the lake the old man, he had seen  thatching the roof by the lake shore. This time, besides his long  snowy beard, he had on his head a crown of water lilies.    \"Mortal,\" said the venerable person. \"That is my daughter you are  clasping. What do you wish to do with her?\"    At once, the farmer broke out in passionate appeal to the old man that  she might become his wife. He promised to love her always, treat her  well, and never be rough or cruel to her.    The old father listened attentively. He was finally convinced that the  farmer would make a good husband for his lovely daughter. Yet he was  very sorry to lose her, and he solemnly laid one condition upon his  future son-in-law.    He was never under any pretense, or in any way, to strike her with  clay, or with anything made or baked from clay. Any blow with that  from which men made pots and pans, and jars and dishes, or in fact,  with earth of any sort, would mean the instant loss of his wife. Even  if children were born in their home, the mother would leave them, and  return to fairy land under the lake, and be forever subject to the law  of the fairies, as before her marriage.    The farmer was very much in love with his pretty prize, and as  promises are easily made, he took oath that no clay should ever touch  her.    They were married and lived very happily together. Years passed and  the man was still a good husband and lover. He kept up the habit which  he had learned from a sailor friend. Every night, when far from home  and out on the sea, he and his mates used to drink this toast;  \"Sweethearts and wives: may every sweetheart become a wife and every  wife remain a sweetheart, and every husband continue a lover.\"    So he proved that though a husband he was still a lover, by always  doing what she asked him and more. When the children were born and  grew up, their father told them about their mother's likes and  dislikes, her tastes and her wishes, and warned them always to be  careful. So it was altogether a very happy family.    One day, the wife and mother said to her husband, that she had a great  longing for apples. She would like to taste some like those which he  long ago gave her. At once, the good man dropped what he was doing and  hurried off to his neighbor, who had first presented him with a  trayful of these apples.    The farmer not only got the fruit, but he also determined that he  would plant a tree and thus have apples for his wife, whenever she  wanted them. So he bought a fine young sapling, to set in his orchard,  for the children to play under and to keep his pantry full of the fine  red-cheeked fruit. At this his wife was delighted.    So happy enough--in fact, too merry to think of anything else, they,  both husband and wife, proceeded to set the sapling in the ground. She  held the tree, while he dug down to make the hole deep enough to make  sure of its growing.    But farmers are sometimes very superstitious. They even believe in  luck, though not in Puck. Some of them have faith in what the almanac,  and the patent medicine may say, and in planting potatoes according to  the moon, but they scout the idea of there being any fairies.    With the farmer, this had become a fixed state of mind and now it  brought him to grief, as we shall see. For though he remembered what  his wife liked and disliked, and recalled what her father had told  him, he had forgotten that she was a fairy.    With this farmer and other Welsh mortals, it had become a habit, when  planting a young tree, to throw the last shovelful of earth over the  left shoulder. This was for good luck. The farmer was afraid to break  such a good custom, as he thought it to be.    So merrily he went to work, forgetting everything in his adherence to  habit. He became so absorbed in his job, that he did not look where  his spadeful went, and it struck his dear wife full in the breast.    At that moment, she cried out bitterly, not in pain, but in sorrow.  Then she started to run towards the lake. At the shore, she called  out, \"Good-by, dear, dear husband.\" Then, leaping into the water, she  was never seen again and all his tears and those of the children never  brought her back.          IX      THE TOUCH OF IRON      Ages ago, before the Cymry rowed in their coracles across the sea,  there was a race of men already in the Land of Honey, as Great Britain  was then called.    These ancient people, who lived in caves, did not know how to build  houses or to plow the ground. They had no idea that they could get  their food out of the earth. As for making bread and pies, cookies and  goodies, from what grew from the soil, they never heard of such a  thing. They were not acquainted with the use of fire for melting  copper, nor did they know how to get iron out of the ore, to make  knives and spears, arrow heads and swords, and armor and helmets.    All they could do was to mold clay, so as to make things to cook with  and hold milk, or water. When they baked this soft stuff in the fire,  they found they had pots, pans and dishes as hard as stone, though  these were easily broken.    To hunt the deer, or fight the wolves and bears, they fashioned clubs  of wood. For javelins and arrows, they took hard stone like flint and  chipped it to points and sharpened it with edges. This was the time  which men now call the Stone Age. When the men went to war, their  weapons were wholly of wood or stone.    They had not yet learned to weave the wool of the sheep into warm  clothing, but they wore the skins of animals. Each one of the caves,  in which they lived, was a general boarding house, for dogs and pigs,  as well as people.
