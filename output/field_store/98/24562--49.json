[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#8)"],[1,"to which I may echo the words of a  certain critic when called upon to give his candid opinion of a  friend's first novel, 'I dare not say what I think about that book.'    About a week before the commencement of the examinations, the ordinary  night-work used to cease, and we were supposed, during that week, to be  steadily going over the old ground and arming ourselves for the  approaching struggle. There were, I suppose, people who actually did do  this, but for my own part I always used to regard those seven days as a  blessed period of rest, set apart specially to enable me to keep  abreast of the light fiction of the day. And most of the form, so far  as I know, thought the same. It was only on the night before the  examination that one began to revise in real earnest. One's methods on  that night resolved themselves into sitting in a chair and wondering  where to begin. Just as one came to a decision, it was bedtime.    'Bradshaw,' I said, as I reached page 103 without having read a line,  'do you know any likely bits?'    Bradshaw looked up from his book. He was attempting to get a general  idea of Thucydides' style by reading _Pickwick_.    'What?' he said.    I obliged with a repetition of my remark.    'Likely bits? Oh, you mean for the Thucydides. I don't know. Mellish  never sets the bits any decent ordinary individual would set. I should  take my chance if I were you.'    'What are you going to do?'    'I'm going to read _Pickwick_. Thicksides doesn't come within a  mile of it.'    I thought so too.    'But how about tomorrow?'    'Oh, I shan't be there,' he said, as if it were the most ordinary of  statements.    'Not there! Why, have you been sacked?'    This really seemed the only possible explanation. Such an event would  not have come as a surprise. It was always a matter for wonder to me  _why_ the authorities never sacked Bradshaw, or at the least  requested him to leave. Possibly it was another case of the ass and the  bundles of hay. They could not make up their minds which special  misdemeanour of his to attack first.    'No, I've not been sacked,' said Bradshaw.    A light dawned upon me.    'Oh,' I said, 'you're going to slumber in.' For the benefit of the  uninitiated, I may mention that to slumber in is to stay in the House  during school on a pretence of illness.    'That,' replied the man of mystery, with considerable asperity, 'is  exactly the silly rotten kid's idea that would come naturally to a  complete idiot like you.'    As a rule, I resent being called a complete idiot, but this was not the  time for asserting one's personal dignity. I had to know what  Bradshaw's scheme for evading the examination was. Perhaps there might  be room for two in it; in which case I should have been exceedingly  glad to have lent my moral support to it. I pressed for an explanation.    'You may jaw,' said Bradshaw at last, 'as much as you jolly well  please, but I'm not going to give this away. All you're going to know  is that I shan't be there tomorrow.'    'I bet you are, and I bet you do a jolly rank paper too,' I said,  remembering that the sceptic is sometimes vouchsafed revelations to  which the most devout believer may not aspire. It is, for instance,  always the young man who scoffs at ghosts that the family spectre  chooses as his audience. But it required more than a mere sneer or an  empty gibe to pump information out of Bradshaw. He took me up at once.    'What'll you bet?' he said.    Now I was prepared to wager imaginary sums to any extent he might have  cared to name, but as my actual worldly wealth at that moment consisted  of one penny, and my expectations were limited to the shilling  pocket-money which I should receive on the following Saturday--half of  which was already mortgaged--it behoved me to avoid doing anything rash  with my ready money. But, since a refusal would have meant the downfall  of my arguments, I was obliged to name a figure. I named an even  sixpence. After all, I felt, I must win. By what means, other than  illness, could Bradshaw possibly avoid putting in an appearance at the  Thucydides examination?    'All right,' said Bradshaw, 'an even sixpence. You'll lose.'    'Slumbering in barred.'    'Of course.'    'Real illness barred too,' I said. Bradshaw is a man of resource, and  has been known to make himself genuinely ill in similar emergencies.    'Right you are. Slumbering in and real illness both barred. Anything  else you'd like to bar?'    I thought.    'No. Unless--' an idea struck me--'You're not going to run away?'    Bradshaw scorned to answer the question.    'Now you'd better buck up with your work,' he said, opening his book  again. 'You've got about as long odds as anyone ever got. But you'll  lose all the same.'    It scarcely seemed possible. And yet--Bradshaw was generally right. If  he said he had a scheme for doing--though it was generally for not  doing--something, it rarely failed to come off. I thought of my  sixpence, my only sixpence, and felt a distinct pang of remorse. After  all, only the other day the chaplain had said how wrong it was to bet.  By Jove, so he had. Decent man the chaplain. Pity to do anything he  would disapprove of. I was on the point of recalling my wager, when  before my mind's eye rose a vision of Bradshaw rampant and sneering,  and myself writhing in my chair a crushed and scored-off wreck. I drew  the line at that. I valued my self-respect at more than sixpence. If it  had been a shilling now--. So I set my teeth and turned once more to my  Thucydides. Bradshaw, having picked up the thread of his story again,  emitted hoarse chuckles like minute guns, until I very nearly rose and  fell upon him. It is maddening to listen to a person laughing and not  to know the joke.    'You will be allowed two hours for this paper,' said Mellish on the  following afternoon, as he returned to his desk after distributing the  Thucydides questions. 'At five minutes to four I shall begin to collect  your papers, but those who wish may go on till ten past. Write only on  one side of the paper, and put your names in the top right-hand corner.  Marks will be given for neatness. Any boy whom I see looking at his  neighbour's--_where's Bradshaw?_'    It was already five minutes past the hour. The latest of the late  always had the decency to appear at least by three minutes past.    'Has anybody seen Bradshaw?' repeated Mellish. 'You,  what's-your-name--' (I am what's-your-name, very much at your  service) '--you are in his House. Have you seen him?'    I could have pointed out with some pleasure at this juncture that if  Cain expressed indignation at being asked where his brother was, I, by  a simple sum in proportion, might with even greater justice feel  annoyed at having to locate a person who was no relative of mine at  all. Did Mr Mellish expect me to keep an eye on every member of my  House? Did Mr Mellish--in short, what did he mean by it?    This was what I thought. I said, 'No, sir.'    'This is extraordinary,' said Mellish, 'most extraordinary. Why, the  boy was in school this morning.'    This was true. The boy had been in school that morning to some purpose,  having beaten all records (his own records) in the gentle sport of  Mellish-baiting. This evidently occurred to Mellish at the time, for he  dropped the subject at once, and told us to begin our papers.    Now I have remarked already that I dare not say what I think of  Thucydides, Book II. How then shall I frame my opinion of that  examination paper? It was Thucydides, Book II, with the few easy parts  left out. It was Thucydides, Book II, with special home-made  difficulties added. It was--well, in its way it was a masterpiece.  Without going into details--I dislike sensational and realistic  writing--I may say that I personally was not one of those who required  an extra ten minutes to finish their papers. I finished mine at  half-past two, and amused myself for the remaining hour and a half by  writing neatly on several sheets of foolscap exactly what I thought of  Mr Mellish, and precisely what I hoped would happen to him some day. It  was grateful and comforting.    At intervals I wondered what had become of Bradshaw. I was not  surprised at his absence. At first I had feared that he would keep his  word in that matter. As time went on I knew that he would. At more  frequent intervals I wondered how I should enjoy being a bankrupt.    Four o'clock came round, and found me so engrossed in putting the  finishing touches to my excursus of Mr Mellish's character, that I  stayed on in the form-room till ten past. Two other members of the form  stayed too, writing with the despairing energy of those who had five  minutes to say what they would like to spread over five hours. At last  Mellish collected the papers. He seemed a trifle surprised when I gave  up my modest three sheets. Brown and Morrison, who had their eye on the  form prize, each gave up reams. Brown told me subsequently that he had  only had time to do sixteen sheets, and wanted to know whether I had  adopted Rutherford's emendation in preference to the old reading in  Question II. My prolonged stay had made him regard me as a possible  rival.    I dwell upon this part of my story, because it has an important bearing  on subsequent events. If I had not waited in the form-room I should not  have gone downstairs just behind Mellish. And if I had not gone  downstairs just behind Mellish, I should not have been in at the death,  that is to say the discovery of Bradshaw, and this story would have  been all beginning and middle, and no ending, for I am certain that  Bradshaw would never have told me a word. He was a most secretive  animal.    I went downstairs, as I say, just behind Mellish. St Austin's, you must  know, is composed of three blocks of buildings, the senior, the middle,  and the junior, joined by cloisters. We left the senior block by the  door. To the captious critic this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],[0,"The Pothunters (#8)"],[1," that. Hullo, prep.'s over.'    The sound of footsteps began to be heard from the direction of the  College. Nine had struck from the School clock, and the Great Hall was  emptying.    'Your turn to read at prayers, Vaughan. Hullo, there's the Mutual.  Didn't hear him unlock the door. Glad he has, though. Saves us  trouble.'    'I must be going down to look up a bit to read. Do you remember when  Harper read the same bit six days running? I shall never forget Ward's  pained expression. Harper explained that he thought the passage so  beautiful that he couldn't leave it.'    'Why don't you try that tip?'    'Hardly. My reputation hasn't quite the stamina for the test.'    Vaughan left the room. At the foot of the stairs he was met by the  matron.    'Will you unlock the door, please, Vaughan,' she said, handing him a  bunch of keys. 'The boys will be coming in in a minute.'    'Unlock the door?' repeated Vaughan. 'I thought it was unlocked. All  right.'    'By Jove,' he thought, 'the plot thickens. What is our only Plunkett  doing out of the House when the door is locked, I wonder.'    Plunkett strolled in with the last batch of the returning crowd,  wearing on his face the virtuous look of one who has been snatching a  whiff of fresh air after a hard evening's preparation.    'Oh, I say, Plunkett,' said Vaughan, when they met in the study after  prayers, 'I wanted to see you. Where have you been?'    'I have been in the junior study. Where did you think I had been?'    'Oh.'    'Do you doubt my word?'    'I've the most exaggerated respect for your word, but you weren't in  the junior study at five to nine.'    'No, I went up to my dormitory about that time. You seem remarkably  interested in my movements.'    'Only wanted to see you about the House gym. team. You might shove up  the list tonight. Haynes, Jarvis, and myself.'    'Very well.'    'I didn't say anything to him,' said Vaughan to Dallas as they were  going to their dormitories, 'but, you know, there's something jolly  fishy about the Mutual. That door wasn't unlocked when we saw him  outside. I unlocked it myself. Seems to me the Mutual's been having a  little private bust of his own on the quiet.'    'That's rum. He might have been out by the front way to see one of the  beaks, though.'    'Well, even then he would be breaking rules. You aren't allowed to go  out after lock-up without House beak's leave. No, I find him guilty.'    'If only he'd go and get booked!' said Vaughan. 'Then he might have to  leave. But he won't. No such luck.'    'No,' said Dallas. 'Good-night.'    'Good-night.'    Certainly there was something mysterious about the matter.          [6]    A LITERARY BANQUET      Charteris and Welch were conversing in the study of which they were the  joint proprietors. That is to say, Charteris was talking and playing  the banjo alternately, while Welch was deep in a book and refused to be  drawn out of it under any pretext. Charteris' banjo was the joy of his  fellows and the bane of his House-master. Being of a musical turn and  owning a good deal of pocket-money, he had, at the end of the summer  holidays, introduced the delights of a phonograph into the House. This  being vetoed by the House-master, he had returned at the beginning of  the following term with a penny whistle, which had suffered a similar  fate. Upon this he had invested in a banjo, and the dazed Merevale,  feeling that matters were getting beyond his grip, had effected a  compromise with him. Having ascertained that there was no specific rule  at St Austin's against the use of musical instruments, he had informed  Charteris that if he saw fit to play the banjo before prep, only, and  regarded the hours between seven and eleven as a close time, all should  be forgiven, and he might play, if so disposed, till the crack of doom.  To this reasonable request Charteris had promptly acceded, and peace  had been restored. Charteris and Welch were a curious pair. Welch spoke  very little. Charteris was seldom silent. They were both in the  Sixth--Welch high up, Charteris rather low down. In games, Welch was  one of those fortunate individuals who are good at everything. He was  captain of cricket, and not only captain, but also the best all-round  man in the team, which is often a very different matter. He was the  best wing three-quarter the School possessed; played fives and racquets  like a professor, and only the day before had shared Tony's glory by  winning the silver medal for fencing in the Aldershot competition.    The abilities of Charteris were more ordinary. He was a sound bat, and  went in first for the Eleven, and played half for the Fifteen. As  regards work, he might have been brilliant if he had chosen, but his  energies were mainly devoted to the compilation of a monthly magazine  (strictly unofficial) entitled _The Glow Worm_. This he edited,  and for the most part wrote himself. It was a clever periodical, and  rarely failed to bring him in at least ten shillings per number, after  deducting the expenses which the College bookseller, who acted as sole  agent, did his best to make as big as possible. Only a very few of the  elect knew the identity of the editor, and they were bound to strict  secrecy. On the day before the publication of each number, a notice was  placed in the desk of the captain of each form, notifying him of what  the morrow would bring forth, and asking him to pass it round the form.  That was all. The School did the rest. _The Glow Worm_ always sold  well, principally because of the personal nature of its contents. If  the average mortal is told that there is something about him in a  paper, he will buy that paper at your own price.    Today he was giving his monthly tea in honour of the new number. Only  contributors were invited, and the menu was always of the best. It was  a _Punch_ dinner, only more so, for these teas were celebrated  with musical honours, and Charteris on the banjo was worth hearing. His  rendering of extracts from the works of Messrs Gilbert and Sullivan was  an intellectual treat.    'When I take the chair at our harmonic club!' he chanted, fixing the  unconscious Welch with a fiery glance. 'Welch!'    'Yes.'    'If this is your idea of a harmonic club, it isn't mine. Put down that  book, and try and be sociable.'    'One second,' said Welch, burrowing still deeper.    'That's what you always say,' said Charteris. 'Look here--Come in.'    There had been a knock at the door as he was speaking. Tony entered,  accompanied by Jim. They were regular attendants at these banquets, for  between them they wrote most of what was left of the magazine when  Charteris had done with it. There was only one other contributor,  Jackson, of Dawson's House, and he came in a few minutes later. Welch  was the athletics expert of the paper, and did most of the match  reports.    'Now we're complete,' said Charteris, as Jackson presented himself.  'Gentlemen--your seats. There are only four chairs, and we, as  Wordsworth might have said, but didn't, are five. All right, I'll sit  on the table. Welch, you worm, away with melancholy. Take away his  book, somebody. That's right. Who says what? Tea already made. Coffee  published shortly. If anybody wants cocoa, I've got some, only you'll  have to boil more water. I regret the absence of menu-cards, but as the  entire feast is visible to the naked eye, our loss is immaterial. The  offertory will be for the Church expenses fund. Biscuits, please.'    'I wish you'd given this tea after next Saturday, Alderman,' said Jim.  Charteris was called the Alderman on account of his figure, which was  inclined to stoutness, and his general capacity for consuming food.    'Never put off till tomorrow--Why?'    'I simply must keep fit for the mile. How's Welch to run, too, if he  eats this sort of thing?' He pointed to the well-spread board.    'Yes, there's something in that,' said Tony. 'Thank goodness, my little  entertainment's over. I think I _will_ try one of those chocolate  things. Thanks.'    'Welch is all right,' said Jackson. 'He could win the hundred and the  quarter on sausage-rolls. But think of the times.'    'And there,' observed Charteris, 'there, my young friend, you have  touched upon a sore subject. Before you came in I was administering a  few wholesome words of censure to that miserable object on your right.  What is a fifth of a second more or less that it should make a man  insult his digestion as Welch does? You'll hardly credit it, but for  the last three weeks or more I have been forced to look on a  fellow-being refusing pastry and drinking beastly extracts of meat, all  for the sake of winning a couple of races. It quite put me off my feed.  Cake, please. Good robust slice. Thanks.'    'It's rather funny when you come to think of it,' said Tony. 'Welch  lives on Bovril for, a month, and then, just as he thinks he's going to  score, a burglar with a sense of humour strolls into the Pav.,  carefully selects the only two cups he had a chance of winning, and so  to bed.'    'Leaving Master J. G. Welch an awful example of what comes of  training,' said Jim. 'Welch, you're a rotter.'    'It isn't my fault,' observed Welch, plaintively. 'You chaps seem to  think I've committed some sort of crime, just because a man I didn't  know from Adam has bagged a cup or two.'    'It looks to me,' said Charteris, 'as if Welch, thinking his chances of  the quarter rather rocky, hired one of his low acquaintances to steal  the cup for him.'    'Shouldn't wonder. Welch knows some jolly low characters in Stapleton.'    'Welch is a jolly low character himself,' said Tony, judicially. 'I  wonder you associate with him, Alderman.'    'Stand _in loco parentis_. Aunt of his asked me to keep an eye on  him. \"Dear George is so wild,\"' she said.    Before Welch could find words to refute this hideous slander, Tony cut  in once more.    'The only reason he doesn't drink gin and play billiards at the \"Blue"]]]
