[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#8)"],[1,"TO PENNSYLVANIA.    For the fifth time Joseph stood by the place of deposit of the stone  box and its precious contents, which for fourteen centuries had  remained concealed from human vision and undisturbed by mortal hand. It  was the morning of the twenty-second day of September, in the year of  our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven. For the last time  he removed the soil and lifted the stone cover, while he prayed that he  might be as faithful to his trust as had been the inanimate hillside.  The angel of the Lord was at his side and bade him stretch forth his  hands and take from their long hiding place the Urim and Thummim and  the record.    Joseph touched them and his being was thrilled with a divine joy. He  lifted them to the surface and examined their beauty.    The Urim and Thummim was as the angel had described it--two precious  stones set in an arch of silver which was fastened to an ancient  breastplate of pure gold, curiously wrought. The breastplate was  concave on one side and convex on the other, and seemed to have been  made for a man of greater stature than is ordinary in modern days. Four  golden bands were fastened to it, for the purpose of attaching it to  the person of its wearer--two of the bands being for the shoulders, the  others for the waist or hips.    The plates, also of gold, were of uniform size; each was slightly less  in thickness than a common sheet of tin and was about eight inches in  width; and all were bound together by three rings, running through one  edge of the plates. Thus secured, they formed a book about six inches  in thickness. A part of the volume, about one-third, was sealed; the  other leaves Joseph turned with his hand. They were covered on both  sides with strange characters, small and beautifully engraved.    Moroni instructed Joseph that he must not attempt to open that part of  the book which was sealed, for the hour had not come wherein it was  destined to be made known; but in God's accepted time he would bring  that portion of the record to the knowledge of His children. Then the  angel repeated all that he had formerly said in advice and blessing.  Joseph was told that the Lord expected him to shield the record  from profane touch and sight, even with his life, until his work of  translation should be completed and the plates restored to the hands of  Moroni; that all the former guardians had relinquished their trust and  he alone would be held accountable for their safety; that efforts would  be made to rob him of the holy writings, but if he proved faithful  the Heavens would give their aid to his support and he would come off  triumphant. And he was finally and solemnly warned that if he should  betray his mission he must be cut off and destroyed.    With a crowning promise to Joseph that he should not be left to grope  in darkness, and that upon the conclusion of the labor of translation,  the angel would visit him and again receive the plates, Moroni  disappeared, and THE PROPHET OF THE LAST DISPENSATION stood alone upon  Cumorah, clasping to his bosom the priceless trust.    Joseph folded the golden record of past generations beneath his mantle  and sped homeward. The words of Moroni had been prophetic; three  different times in the brief journey to his house, the chosen minister  of salvation was assailed by unknown men--emissaries of the evil one,  who sought to strike him to the earth and rob him of his precious  charge. Once they dealt him a terrific blow with a bludgeon, but he  did not fall. He was a man of rare physical endowments, yet on this  occasion his own strength and activity, without the help of the Lord,  would not have delivered him or been sufficient to cast his assailants  one by one prone in the dust with the irresistible force which he used  against them.    With the plates unharmed, but himself bruised, and panting from the  contest, Joseph reached his home.    After this important hour the powers of darkness arrayed all their  subtle and murderous influences against him. Abominable falsehoods were  cunningly circulated against him and his father's family, the purpose  being to excite the rage of the populace against them. Constantly the  Prophet's life was beset by assassins; the sacred record was sought  by robbers. Each hour brought some new menace. Men, lurking by his  pathway, discharged deadly weapons at his person; and mobs attacked him  and invaded his home. Wherever the plates were supposed to be hidden,  there were the despoilers breaking through bolts and walls. Open force  failing, subtle stratagems were devised for the destruction of the  Prophet's life and the abstraction of the plates.    These numerous efforts all failed to accomplish the ends at which  they were aimed. But they prevented Joseph from obtaining the safe  leisure necessary for his labor of translation. Anxious to pursue his  heaven-appointed work without the interruption of these continued  attacks, he was led to the idea of removing from Manchester. Personal  fear was not an element of his nature, and no selfish motive prompted  his resolve; but in no other visible manner could his sacred  instructions be fulfilled. The home of Emma's parents in Susquehanna  County, Pennsylvania, was the place which he selected, and thither he  determined to journey.    Poverty seemed, however, to present an insurmountable barrier; but it  was suddenly removed. Martin Harris, a prosperous and respected farmer  of Wayne County, New York, and who was destined in the providence of  God to afterwards fill an important part in connection with the divine  record, was inspired to come to Joseph with a free offer of help. By  the aid thus extended, the Prophet was able to take his departure to  Manchester, carrying with him his wife and the sacred plates. As Joseph  and Mary were warned to flee with the infant Jesus into Egypt to escape  the destruction which Herod had planned, so the Prophet was led to seek  another place of residence for the performance of his labor.    But Satan was not idle. Twice while on the journey was the servant  of God stopped by officers, who, under a pretended warrant of law,  searched his wagon for the plates. But the angel of the Lord blinded  the eyes of the wicked and they found not what they sought.    It was in the month of December, 1827, when Joseph reached the house  of Isaac Hale in Pennsylvania; and without delay he began his inspired  work of translation by the aid of the seer stones.    It may seem strange and unaccountable that such extraordinary efforts  should be made to destroy this young man and to get possession of the  plates with which he had been entrusted. But his whole life from this  time forward until he sealed his testimony with his blood was filled  with incidents of the most remarkable character. The words of the angel  were that God had a work for Joseph to do, and that his name should  be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds and tongues; or  that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people; and  they were fulfilled to the letter. No man of this generation was so  passionately loved; no man was so cruelly hated. Satan knew that if  the work of which God had chosen him to be the founder on the earth  should prevail, his power and dominion should be overthrown. Against  this Prophet, therefore, the profoundest depths of hell were stirred  up. While he lived he was the target at which the most deadly shafts of  Satan were directed. For the succeeding sixteen or seventeen years from  the time of which we write his steps were beset by peril. Violence and  murder lurked in his pathway. He was never free from menace. Through  his life he enjoyed peace, but it was the peace that came from above  and not that which arises from auspicious surroundings and undisturbed  quiet. He was a happy man; but his happiness was never due to worldly  favor or popularity. God had endowed him with a buoyancy of spirit  and a strength of faith that the most deadly opposition and the most  threatening difficulties could not repress; with a courage which, in  the midst of brutal mobs howling for his blood, never faltered or was  quenched. His was a stormy career; but he was amply qualified for it.  As he himself said on one occasion:        And as for perils which I am called to pass through, they seem but      a small thing to me, as the envy and wrath of man have been my      common lot all the days of my life, and for what cause it seems      mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of      the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it.      Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things whether it be      good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim      in. It has all become a second nature to me, and I feel like Paul,      to glory in tribulation, for to this day has the God of my fathers      delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth;      for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the      Lord God hath spoken it.        CHAPTER VII.    JOSEPH COPIES AND TRANSLATES FROM THE PLATES--MARTIN HARRIS AGAIN COMES  OPPORTUNELY--PROFESSOR ANTHON AND THE CHARACTERS--MARTIN'S LABOR AS A  SCRIBE--HIS BROKEN TRUST--THE TRANSLATION LOST TO JOSEPH--THE PROPHET  PUNISHED FOR WILFULNESS.    Joseph's first labor with the plates was in obedience to the general  command given to him through Moroni. The particular means by which the  translation was to be effected and given to the world had not been made  known; and this young, untaught, impoverished man was at that hour  unable, within his own resources of education and purse, to arrange  for the consummation of the work. He devoted every available moment,  however, to his sacred task, constantly praying to the Almighty for  aid; and yet the progress was slow.    In every step which Joseph took as the chosen messenger of God, human"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5999"],[0,"Guy Mannering; or, The Astrologer — Complete (#8)"],[1,"with homely Scottish characters of everyday  life, with exaggerated types of humorous absurdity, and with wildly  adventurous banditti, who appealed to the old strain of the Border reiver  in his blood. The wandering plot of \"Guy Mannering\" enabled him to  introduce examples of all these sorts. The good-humoured, dull, dawdling  Ellangowan, a laird half dwindled to a yeoman, is a sketch absolutely  accurate, and wonderfully touched with pathos. The landladies, Mrs.  MacCandlish and Tib Mumps, are little masterpieces; so is Mac-Morlan, the  foil to Glossin; and so is Pleydell, allowing for the manner of the age.  Glossin himself is best when least villanous. Sir Robert Hazlewood is  hardly a success. But as to Jock Jabos, a Southern Scot may say that he  knows Jock Jabos in the flesh, so persistent is the type of that  charioteer. It is partly Scott's good fortune, partly it is his evil  luck, to be so inimitably and intimately true in his pictures of Scottish  character. This wins the heart of his countrymen, indeed; but the  stranger can never know how good Scott really is, any more than a  Frenchman can appreciate Falstaff. Thus the alien may be vexed by what he  thinks the mere clannish enthusiasm of praise, in Scott's countrymen.  Every little sketch of a passing face is exquisite in Scott's work, when  he is at his best. For example, Dandie Dinmont's children are only  indicated \"with a dusty roll of the brush;\" but we recognize at once the  large, shy, kindly families of the Border. Dandie himself, as the  \"Edinburgh Review\" said (1817), \"is beyond all question the best rustic  portrait that has ever yet been exhibited to the public,--the most  honourable to rustics, and the most creditable to the heart as well as to  the genius of the Author, the truest to nature, the most complete in all  its lineaments.\" Dandie is always delightful,--whether at Mumps's Hall,  or on the lonely moor, or at home in Charlieshope, or hunting, or  leistering fish, or entering terriers at vermin, or fighting, or going to  law, or listening to the reading of a disappointing will, or entertaining  the orphan whom others neglect; always delightful he is, always generous,  always true, always the Border farmer. There is no better stock of men,  none less devastated by \"the modern spirit.\" His wife is worthy of him,  and has that singular gentleness, kindliness, and dignity which prevail  on the Border, even in households far less prosperous than that of Dandie  Dinmont.--[Dr. John Brown's Ailie, in \"Rab and his Friends,\" will  naturally occur to the mind of every reader.]    Among Scott's \"character parts,\" or types broadly humorous, few have been  more popular than Dominie Sampson. His ungainly goodness, unwieldy  strength, and inaccessible learning have made great sport, especially  when \"Guy Mannering\" was \"Terryfied\" for the stage.    As Miss Bertram remarks in that singular piece,--where even Jock Jabos  \"wins till his English,\" like Elspeth in the Antiquary,--the Dominie  \"rather forces a tear from the eye of sentiment than a laugh from the  lungs of ribaldry.\" In the play, however, he sits down to read a folio on  some bandboxes, which, very naturally, \"give way under him.\" As he has  just asked Mrs. Mac-Candlish after the health of both her husbands, who  are both dead, the lungs of ribaldry are more exercised than the fine eye  of sentiment. We scarcely care to see our Dominie treated thus. His  creator had the very lowest opinion of the modern playwright's craft, and  probably held that stage humour could not be too palpable and practical.  Lockhart writes (v. 130): \"What share the novelist himself had in this  first specimen of what he used to call 'the art of Terryfying' I cannot  exactly say; but his correspondence shows that the pretty song of the  'Lullaby' was not his only contribution to it; and I infer that he had  taken the trouble to modify the plot and rearrange for stage purposes a  considerable part of the original dialogue.\" Friends of the Dominie may  be glad to know, perhaps on Scott's own testimony, that he was an alumnus  of St. Andrews. \"I was boarded for twenty pence a week at Luckie  Sour-kail's, in the High Street of St. Andrews.\" He was also fortunate  enough to hold a bursary in St. Leonard's College, which, however, is a  blunder. St. Leonard's and St. Salvator's had already been merged in the  United College (1747). All this is in direct contradiction to the  evidence in the novel, which makes the Dominie a Glasgow man. Yet the  change seems to be due to Scott rather than to Terry. It is certain that  Colonel Mannering would not have approved of the treatment which the  Dominie undergoes, in a play whereof the plot and conduct fall little  short of the unintelligible.    Against the character of Pleydell \"a few murmurs of pedantic criticism,\"  as Lockhart says, were uttered, and it was natural that Pleydell should  seem an incredible character to English readers. But there is plenty of  evidence that his \"High Jinks\" were not exaggerated.    There remains the heroine of the novel, as Mr. Ruskin not incorrectly  calls her, Meg Merrilies, the sybil who so captivated the imagination of  Keats. Among Scott's many weird women, she is the most romantic, with her  loyal heart and that fiery natural eloquence which, as Scott truly  observed, does exist ready for moments of passion, even among the  reticent Lowlanders. The child of a mysterious wandering race, Meg has a  double claim to utter such speeches as she addresses to Ellangowan after  the eviction of her tribe. Her death, as Mr. Ruskin says, is  \"self-devoted, heroic in the highest, and happy.\" The devotion of Meg  Merrilies, the grandeur of her figure, the music of her songs, more than  redeem the character of Dirk Hatteraick, even if we hold, with the  \"Edinburgh\" reviewer, that he is \"a vulgar bandit of the German school,\"  just as the insipidity and flageolet of the hero are redeemed by the  ballad sung in the moment of recognition.           \"Are these the Links of Forth, she said,            Or are they the crooks of Dee,            Or the bonnie woods of Warroch Head,            That I so fain would see?\"  \"Guy Mannering,\" according to Lockhart, was \"pronounced by acclamation  fully worthy to share the honours of 'Waverley.'\" One star differeth from  another in glory, and \"Guy Mannering\" has neither that vivid picture of  clannish manners nor that noble melancholy of a gallant and forlorn  endeavour of the Lost Cause,                \"When all was done that man may do,                 And all was done in vain,\"  which give dignity to \"Waverley.\" Yet, with Lockhart, we may admire, in  \"Guy Mannering,\" \"the rapid, ever-heightening interest of the narrative,  the unaffected kindliness of feeling, the manly purity of thought,  everywhere mingled with a gentle humour and homely sagacity, but, above  all, the rich variety and skilful contrast of character and manners, at  once fresh in fiction and stamped with the unforgeable seal of truth and  nature.\"    ANDREW LANG.              GUY MANNERING    OR    THE ASTROLOGER              CHAPTER I       He could not deny that, looking round upon the dreary region,       and seeing nothing but bleak fields and naked trees, hills       obscured by fogs, and flats covered with inundations, he did       for some time suffer melancholy to prevail upon him, and       wished himself again safe at home.              --'Travels of Will. Marvel,' IDLER, No. 49.  It was in the beginning of the month of November 17--when a young English  gentleman, who had just left the university of Oxford, made use of the  liberty afforded him to visit some parts of the north of England; and  curiosity extended his tour into the adjacent frontier of the sister  country. He had visited, on the day that opens our history, some monastic  ruins in the county of Dumfries, and spent much of the day in making  drawings of them from different points, so that, on mounting his horse to  resume his journey, the brief and gloomy twilight of the season had  already commenced. His way lay through a wide tract of black moss,  extending for miles on each side and before him. Little eminences arose  like islands on its surface, bearing here and there patches of corn,  which even at this season was green, and sometimes a hut or farm-house,  shaded by a willow or two and surrounded by large elder-bushes. These  insulated dwellings communicated with each other by winding passages  through the moss, impassable by any but the natives themselves. The  public road, however, was tolerably well made and safe, so that the  prospect of being benighted brought with it no real danger. Still it is  uncomfortable to travel alone and in the dark through an unknown country;  and there are few ordinary occasions upon which Fancy frets herself so  much as in a situation like that of Mannering.    As the light grew faint and more faint, and the morass appeared blacker  and blacker, our traveller questioned more closely each chance passenger  on his distance from the village of Kippletringan, where he proposed to  quarter for the night. His queries were usually answered by a  counter-challenge respecting the place from whence he came. While  sufficient daylight remained to show the dress and appearance of a  gentleman, these cross interrogatories were usually put in the form of a  case supposed, as, 'Ye'll hae been at the auld abbey o' Halycross, sir?  there's mony English gentlemen gang to see that.'--Or, 'Your honour will  become frae the house o' Pouderloupat?' But when the voice of the querist  alone was distinguishable, the response usually was, 'Where are ye coming  frae at sic a time o' night as the like o' this?'--or, 'Ye'll no be o'  this country, freend?' The answers, when obtained, were neither very  reconcilable to each other nor accurate in the information which they  afforded. Kippletringan was distant at first 'a gey bit'; then the 'gey  bit'"]]]
