That was all right; it was the public cheese. But he also  reached across for the celery--my private celery for which I  owed. Foolishly--you know how one does--I had left the sweetest  and crispest shoots till the last, tantalizing myself pleasantly  with the thought of them. Horror! to see them snatched from me by  a stranger. He realized later what he had done and apologized,  but of what good is an apology in such circumstances? Yet at  least the tragedy was not without its value. Now one remembers to  lock the door.    Yes, I can face the winter with calm. I suppose I had forgotten  what it was really like. I had been thinking of the winter as a  horrid wet, dreary time fit only for professional football. Now I  can see other things--crisp and sparkling days, long pleasant  evenings, cheery fires. Good work shall be done this winter. Life  shall be lived well. The end of the summer is not the end of the  world. Here's to October--and, waiter, some more celery.          A Christmas Number      The common joke against the Christmas number is that it is  planned in July and made up in September. This enables it to be  published in the middle of November and circulated in New Zealand  by Christmas. If it were published in England at Christmas, New  Zealand wouldn't get it till February. Apparently it is more  important that the colonies should have it punctually than that  we should.    Anyway, whenever it is made up, all journalists hate the  Christmas number. But they only hate it for one reason--this  being that the ordinary weekly number has to be made up at the  same time. As a journalist I should like to devote the autumn  exclusively to the Christmas number, and as a member of the  public I should adore it when it came out. Not having been asked  to produce such a number on my own I can amuse myself here by  sketching out a plan for it. I follow the fine old tradition.  First let us get the stories settled. Story No. 1 deals with the  escaped convict. The heroine is driving back from the country-  house ball, where she has had two or three proposals, when  suddenly, in the most lonely part of the snow-swept moor, a  figure springs out of the ditch and covers the coachman with a  pistol. Alarms and confusions. \"Oh, sir,\" says the heroine,  \"spare my aunt and I will give you all my jewels.\" The convict,  for such it is, staggers back. \"Lucy!\" he cries. \"Harold!\" she  gasps. The aunt says nothing, for she has swooned. At this point  the story stops to explain how Harold came to be in  knickerbockers. He had either been falsely accused or else he had  been a solicitor. Anyhow, he had by this time more than paid for  his folly, and Lucy still loved him. \"Get in,\" she says, and  drives him home. Next day he leaves for New Zealand in an  ordinary lounge suit. Need I say that Lucy joins him later? No;  that shall be left for your imagination. The End.      So much for the first story. The second is an \"i'-faith-and-stap-  me\" story of the good old days. It is not seasonable, for most of  the action takes place in my lord's garden amid the scent of  roses; but it brings back to us the old romantic days when  fighting and swearing were more picturesque  than they are now,  and when women loved and worked samplers. This sort of story can  be read best in front of the Christmas log; it is of the past,  and comes naturally into a Christmas number. I shall not describe  its plot, for that is unimportant; it is the \"stap me's\" and the  \"la, sirs,\" which matter. But I may say that she marries him all  right in the end, and he goes off happily to the wars.    We want another story. What shall this one be about? It might be  about the amateur burglar, or the little child who reconciled old  Sir John to his daughter's marriage, or the ghost at Enderby  Grange, or the millionaire's Christmas dinner, or the accident to  the Scotch express. Personally, I do not care for any of these;  my vote goes for the desert-island story. Proud Lady Julia has  fallen off the deck of the liner, and Ronald, refused by her that  morning, dives off the hurricane deck--or the bowsprit or  wherever he happens to be--and seizes her as she is sinking for  the third time. It is a foggy night and their absence is  unnoticed. Dawn finds them together on a little coral reef. They  are in no danger, for several liners are due to pass in a day or  two and Ronald's pockets are full of biscuits and chocolate, but  it is awkward for Lady Julia, who had hoped that they would never  meet again. So they sit on the beach back to back (drawn by Dana  Gibson) and throw sarcastic remarks over their shoulders at each  other. In the end he tames her proud spirit--I think by hiding  the turtles' eggs from her--and the next liner but one takes the  happy couple back to civilization.    But it is time we had some poetry. I propose to give you one  serious poem about robins, and one double-page humorous piece,  well illustrated in colours. I think the humorous verses must  deal with hunting. Hunting does not lend itself to humour, for  there are only two hunting jokes --the joke of the horse which  came down at the brook and the joke of the Cockney who overrode  hounds; but there are traditions to keep up, and the artist  always loves it. So far we have not considered the artist  sufficiently. Let us give him four full pages. One of pretty  girls hanging up mistletoe, one of the squire and his family  going to church in the snow, one of a brokendown coach with  highwaymen coming over the hill, and one of the postman bringing  loads and loads of parcels. You have all Christmas in those four  pictures. But there is room for another page--let it be a  coloured page, of half a dozen sketches, the period and the  lettering very early English. \"Ye Baron de Marchebankes calleth  for hys varlet.\" \"Ye varlet cometh righte hastilie---\" You know  the delightful kind of thing.    I confess that this is the sort of Christmas number which I love.  You may say that you have seen it all before; I say that that is  why I love it. The best of Christmas is that it reminds us of  other Christmases; it should be the boast of Christmas numbers  that they remind us of other Christmas numbers.    But though I doubt if I shall get quite what I want from any one  number this year, yet there will surely be enough in all the  numbers to bring Christmas very pleasantly before the eyes. In a  dull November one likes to be reminded that Christmas is coming.  It is perhaps as well that the demands of the colonies give us  our Christmas numbers so early. At the same time it is difficult  to see why New Zealand wants a Christmas number at all. As I  glance above at the plan of my model paper I feel more than ever  how adorable it would be--but not, oh not with the thermometer at  a hundred in the shade.          No Flowers by Request      If a statement is untrue, it is not the more respectable because  it has been said in Latin. We owe the war, directly, no doubt, to  the Kaiser, but indirectly to the Roman idiot who said, \"Si vis  pacem, para bellum.\" Having mislaid my Dictionary of Quotations I  cannot give you his name, but I have my money on him as the  greatest murderer in history.    Yet there have always been people who would quote this classical  lie as if it were at least as authoritative as anything said in  the Sermon on the Mount. It was said a long time ago, and in a  strange language--that was enough for them. In the same way they  will say, \"De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\" But I warn them solemnly  that it will take a good deal more than this to stop me from  saying what I want to say about the recently expired month of  February.    I have waited purposely until February was  dead. Cynics may say  that this was only wisdom, in that a damnatory notice from me  might have inspired that unhappy month to an unusually brilliant  run, out of sheer wilfulness. I prefer to think that it was good  manners which forbade me to be disrespectful to her very face. It  is bad manners to speak the truth to the living, but February is  dead. De mortuis nil nisi veritas.    The truth about poor February is that she is the worst month of  the year. But let us be fair to her. She has never had a chance.  We cannot say to her, \"Look upon this picture and on this. This  you might have been; this you are.\" There is no \"might have been\"  for her, no ideal February. The perfect June we can imagine for  ourselves. Personally I do not mind how hot it be, but there must  be plenty of strawberries. The perfect April--ah, one dare not  think of the perfect April. That can only happen in the next  world. Yet April may always be striving for it, though she never  reach it. But the perfect February--what is it? I know not. Let  us pity February, then, even while we blame her.    For February comes just when we are sick of winter, and therefore  she may not be wintry. Wishing to do her best, she ventures her  spring costume, crocus and primrose and daffodil days; days when  the first faint perfume of mint is blown down the breezes, and  one begins to wonder how the lambs are shaping. Is that the ideal  February? Ah no! For we cannot be deceived. We know that spring  is not here; that March is to come with its frosts and perchance  its snows, a worse March for the milder February, a plunge back  into the winter which poor February tried to flatter us was over.    Such a February is a murderer--an accessory to the murders of  March. She lays the ground-bait for the victims. Out pop the  stupid little flowers, eager to be deceived (one could forgive  the annuals, but the perennials ought to know better by now), and  down comes March, a roaring lion, to gobble them up.    And how much lost fruit do we not owe to February!

Chauvelin, with his memory harking back on many  mysterious abductions at the very foot of the guillotine, would have  liked to see his elusive enemy quietly put to death amongst a batch of  traitors, who would help to mask his personality until after the  guillotine had fallen, when the whole of Paris should ring with the  triumph of this final punishment of the hated spy.    In the end, the two friends agreed upon a compromise, and parted well  pleased with the turn of events which a kind Fate had ordered for their  own special benefit.    X    Thus satisfied, Chauvelin returned to the Abbaye. Hebert was safe and  trustworthy, but Hebert, too, had been assailed with the same doubts  which had well-nigh wrecked Chauvelin's triumph, and with such doubts in  his mind he might slacken his vigilance.    Name of a name! every man in charge of that damnable Scarlet Pimpernel  should have three pairs of eyes wherewith to watch his movements. He  should have the alert brain of a Robespierre, the physical strength of a  Danton, the relentlessness of a Marat. He should be a giant in sheer  brute force, a tiger in caution, an elephant in weight, and a mouse in  stealthiness!    Name of a name! but 'twas only hate that could give such powers to any  man!    Hebert, in the guard-room, owned to his doubts. His comrades, too,  admitted that after twenty-four hours spent on the watch, their minds  were in a whirl. The Citizen Commissary had been so sure--so was the  chief concierge of the Abbaye even now; and the men of the Surete!...  they themselves had seen the real Mole more than once ... and this man  in the cell.... Well, would the citizen Representative have a final good  look at him?    \"You seem to forget Calais, citizen Hebert,\" Chauvelin said sharply,  \"and the deadly humiliation you suffered then at the hands of this man  who is now your prisoner. Surely your eyes should have been, at least,  as keen as mine own.\"    Anxious, irritable, his nerves well-nigh on the rack, he nevertheless  crossed the guard-room with a firm step and entered the cell where the  prisoner was still lying upon the palliasse, as he had been all along,  and still presenting that naked piece of shoulder through the hole in  his shirt.    \"He has been like this the best part of the day,\" Hebert said with a  shrug of the shoulders. \"We put his bread and water right under his  nose. He ate and he drank, and I suppose he slept. But except for a good  deal of swearing, he has not spoken to any of us.\"    He had followed his chief into the cell, and now stood beside the  palliasse, holding a small dark lantern in his hand. At a sign from  Chauvelin he flashed the light upon the prisoner's averted head.    Mole cursed for awhile, and muttered something about \"good patriots\" and  about \"retribution.\" Then, worried by the light, he turned slowly round,  and with fish-like, bleary eyes looked upon his visitor.    The words of stinging irony and triumphant sarcasm, all fully prepared,  froze on Chauvelin's lips. He gazed upon the prisoner, and a weird sense  of something unfathomable and mysterious came over him as he gazed. He  himself could not have defined that feeling: the very next moment he was  prepared to ridicule his own cowardice--yes, cowardice! because for a  second or two he had felt positively afraid.    Afraid of what, forsooth? The man who crouched here in the cell was his  arch-enemy, the Scarlet Pimpernel--the man whom he hated most bitterly  in all the world, the man whose death he desired more than that of any  other living creature. He had been apprehended by the very side of the  murdered man whose confidence he had all but gained. He himself  (Chauvelin) had at that fateful moment looked into the factitious Mole's  eyes, had seen the mockery in them, the lazy insouciance which was the  chief attribute of Sir Percy Blakeney. He had heard a faint echo of that  inane laugh which grated upon his nerves. Hebert had then laid hands  upon this very same man; agents of the Surete had barred every ingress  and egress to the house, had conducted their prisoner straightway to the  depot and thence to the Abbaye, had since that moment guarded him on  sight, by day and by night. Hebert and the other men as well as the  chief warder, all swore to that!    No, no! There could be no doubt! There was no doubt! The days of magic  were over! A man could not assume a personality other than his own; he  could not fly out of that personality like a bird out of its cage. There  on the palliasse in the miserable cell were the same long limbs, the  broad shoulders, the grimy face with the three days' growth of stubbly  beard--the whole wretched personality of Paul Mole, in fact, which hid  the exquisite one of Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart. And yet!...    A cold sweat ran down Chauvelin's spine as he gazed, mute and immovable,  into those fish-like, bleary eyes, which were not--no! they were not  those of the real Scarlet Pimpernel.    The whole situation became dreamlike, almost absurd. Chauvelin was not  the man for such a mock-heroic, melodramatic situation. Commonsense,  reason, his own cool powers of deliberation, would soon reassert  themselves. But for the moment he was dazed. He had worked too hard, no  doubt; had yielded too much to excitement, to triumph, and to hate. He  turned to Hebert, who was standing stolidly by, gave him a few curt  orders in a clear and well-pitched voice. Then he walked out of the  cell, without bestowing another look on the prisoner.    Mole had once more turned over on his palliasse and, apparently, had  gone to sleep. Hebert, with a strange and puzzled laugh, followed his  chief out of the cell.    XI    At first Chauvelin had the wish to go back and see the Public  Prosecutor--to speak with him--to tell him--what? Yes, what? That he,  Chauvelin, had all of a sudden been assailed with the same doubts which  already had worried Hebert and the others?--that he had told a  deliberate lie when he stated that the incriminating doggerel rhyme had  been found in Mole's cell? No, no! Such an admission would not only be  foolish, it would be dangerous now, whilst he himself was scarce  prepared to trust to his own senses. After all, Fouquier-Tinville was in  the right frame of mind for the moment. Paul Mole, whoever he was, was  safely under lock and key.    The only danger lay in the direction of the house on the Chemin de  Pantin. At the thought Chauvelin felt giddy and faint. But he would  allow himself no rest. Indeed, he could not have rested until something  approaching certainty had once more taken possession of his soul. He  could not--would not--believe that he had been deceived. He was still  prepared to stake his very life on the identity of the prisoner at the  Abbaye. Tricks of light, the flash of the lantern, the perfection of the  disguise, had caused a momentary illusion--nothing more.    Nevertheless, that awful feeling of restlessness which had possessed him  during the last twenty-four hours once more drove him to activity. And  although commonsense and reason both pulled one way, an eerie sense of  superstition whispered in his ear the ominous words, \"If, after all!\"    At any rate, he would see the Leridans, and once more make sure of them;  and, late as was the hour, he set out for the lonely house on the Pantin  Road.    Just inside the Barriere du Combat was the Poste de Section, where  Commissary Burban was under orders to provide a dozen men of the Surete,  who were to be on the watch round and about the house of the Leridans.  Chauvelin called in on the Commissary, who assured him that the men were  at their post.    Thus satisfied, he crossed the Barriere and started at a brisk walk down  the long stretch of the Chemin de Pantin. The night was dark. The  rolling clouds overhead hid the face of the moon and presaged the storm.  On the right, the irregular heights of the Buttes Chaumont loomed out  dense and dark against the heavy sky, whilst to the left, on ahead, a  faintly glimmering, greyish streak of reflected light revealed the  proximity of the canal.    Close to the spot where the main Route de Meux intersects the Chemin de  Pantin, Chauvelin slackened his pace. The house of the Leridans now lay  immediately on his left; from it a small, feeble ray of light, finding  its way no doubt through an ill-closed shutter, pierced the surrounding  gloom. Chauvelin, without hesitation, turned up a narrow track which led  up to the house across a field of stubble. The next moment a peremptory  challenge brought him to a halt.    \"Who goes there?\"    \"Public Safety,\" replied Chauvelin. \"Who are you?\"    \"Of the Surete,\" was the counter reply. \"There are a dozen of us about  here.\"    \"When did you arrive?\"    \"Some two hours ago. We marched out directly after you left the orders  at the Commissariat.\"    \"You are prepared to remain on the watch all night?\"    \"Those are our orders, citizen,\" replied the man.    \"You had best close up round the house, then. And, name of a dog!\" he  added, with a threatening ring in his voice. \"Let there be no slackening  of vigilance this night. No one to go in or out of that house, no one to  approach it under any circumstances whatever. Is that understood?\"    \"Those were our orders from the first, citizen,\" said the man simply.    \"And all has been well up to now?\"    \"We have seen no one, citizen.\"    The little party closed in around their chief and together they marched  up to the house. Chauvelin, on tenterhooks, walked quicker than the  others. He was the first to reach the door. Unable to find the bell-pull  in the dark, he knocked vigorously.    The house appeared silent and wrapped in sleep. No light showed from  within save that one tiny speck through the cracks of an ill-fitting  shutter, in a room immediately overhead.    In response to Chauvelin's repeated summons, there came anon the sound  of someone moving in one of the upstairs"]]]
