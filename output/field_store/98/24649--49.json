A giant Negro lifted her to the pommel  of his saddle, and while the raiders searched the bungalow and  outhouses for plunder he rode with her beyond the gates and waited the  coming of his master.    Jane Clayton saw the raiders lead the horses from the corral, and drive  the herds in from the fields.  She saw her home plundered of all that  represented intrinsic worth in the eyes of the Arabs, and then she saw  the torch applied, and the flames lick up what remained.    And at last, when the raiders assembled after glutting their fury and  their avarice, and rode away with her toward the north, she saw the  smoke and the flames rising far into the heavens until the winding of  the trail into the thick forests hid the sad view from her eyes.    As the flames ate their way into the living-room, reaching out forked  tongues to lick up the bodies of the dead, one of that gruesome company  whose bloody welterings had long since been stilled, moved again.  It  was a huge black who rolled over upon his side and opened blood-shot,  suffering eyes.  Mugambi, whom the Arabs had left for dead, still  lived.  The hot flames were almost upon him as he raised himself  painfully upon his hands and knees and crawled slowly toward the  doorway.    Again and again he sank weakly to the floor; but each time he rose  again and continued his pitiful way toward safety.  After what seemed  to him an interminable time, during which the flames had become a  veritable fiery furnace at the far side of the room, the great black  managed to reach the veranda, roll down the steps, and crawl off into  the cool safety of some nearby shrubbery.    All night he lay there, alternately unconscious and painfully sentient;  and in the latter state watching with savage hatred the lurid flames  which still rose from burning crib and hay cock.  A prowling lion  roared close at hand; but the giant black was unafraid.  There was  place for but a single thought in his savage mind--revenge!  revenge!  revenge!          7    The Jewel-Room of Opar      For some time Tarzan lay where he had fallen upon the floor of the  treasure chamber beneath the ruined walls of Opar.  He lay as one dead;  but he was not dead.  At length he stirred.  His eyes opened upon the  utter darkness of the room.  He raised his hand to his head and brought  it away sticky with clotted blood.  He sniffed at his fingers, as a  wild beast might sniff at the life-blood upon a wounded paw.    Slowly he rose to a sitting posture--listening.  No sound reached to  the buried depths of his sepulcher.  He staggered to his feet, and  groped his way about among the tiers of ingots.  What was he?  Where  was he?  His head ached; but otherwise he felt no ill effects from the  blow that had felled him.  The accident he did not recall, nor did he  recall aught of what had led up to it.    He let his hands grope unfamiliarly over his limbs, his torso, and his  head.  He felt of the quiver at his back, the knife in his loin cloth.  Something struggled for recognition within his brain.  Ah!  he had it.  There was something missing.  He crawled about upon the floor, feeling  with his hands for the thing that instinct warned him was gone.  At  last he found it--the heavy war spear that in past years had formed so  important a feature of his daily life, almost of his very existence, so  inseparably had it been connected with his every action since the  long-gone day that he had wrested his first spear from the body of a  black victim of his savage training.    Tarzan was sure that there was another and more lovely world than that  which was confined to the darkness of the four stone walls surrounding  him.  He continued his search and at last found the doorway leading  inward beneath the city and the temple.  This he followed, most  incautiously.  He came to the stone steps leading upward to the higher  level.  He ascended them and continued onward toward the well.    Nothing spurred his hurt memory to a recollection of past familiarity  with his surroundings.  He blundered on through the darkness as though  he were traversing an open plain under the brilliance of a noonday sun,  and suddenly there happened that which had to happen under the  circumstances of his rash advance.    He reached the brink of the well, stepped outward into space, lunged  forward, and shot downward into the inky depths below.  Still clutching  his spear, he struck the water, and sank beneath its surface, plumbing  the depths.    The fall had not injured him, and when he rose to the surface, he shook  the water from his eyes, and found that he could see.  Daylight was  filtering into the well from the orifice far above his head.  It  illumined the inner walls faintly.  Tarzan gazed about him.  On the  level with the surface of the water he saw a large opening in the dark  and slimy wall.  He swam to it, and drew himself out upon the wet floor  of a tunnel.    Along this he passed; but now he went warily, for Tarzan of the Apes  was learning.  The unexpected pit had taught him care in the traversing  of dark passageways--he needed no second lesson.    For a long distance the passage went straight as an arrow.  The floor  was slippery, as though at times the rising waters of the well  overflowed and flooded it.  This, in itself, retarded Tarzan's pace,  for it was with difficulty that he kept his footing.    The foot of a stairway ended the passage.  Up this he made his way.  It  turned back and forth many times, leading, at last, into a small,  circular chamber, the gloom of which was relieved by a faint light  which found ingress through a tubular shaft several feet in diameter  which rose from the center of the room's ceiling, upward to a distance  of a hundred feet or more, where it terminated in a stone grating  through which Tarzan could see a blue and sun-lit sky.    Curiosity prompted the ape-man to investigate his surroundings.  Several metal-bound, copper-studded chests constituted the sole  furniture of the round room.  Tarzan let his hands run over these.  He  felt of the copper studs, he pulled upon the hinges, and at last, by  chance, he raised the cover of one.    An exclamation of delight broke from his lips at sight of the pretty  contents.  Gleaming and glistening in the subdued light of the chamber,  lay a great tray full of brilliant stones.  Tarzan, reverted to the  primitive by his accident, had no conception of the fabulous value of  his find.  To him they were but pretty pebbles.  He plunged his hands  into them and let the priceless gems filter through his fingers.  He  went to others of the chests, only to find still further stores of  precious stones.  Nearly all were cut, and from these he gathered a  handful and filled the pouch which dangled at his side--the uncut  stones he tossed back into the chests.    Unwittingly, the ape-man had stumbled upon the forgotten jewel-room of  Opar.  For ages it had lain buried beneath the temple of the Flaming  God, midway of one of the many inky passages which the superstitious  descendants of the ancient Sun Worshipers had either dared not or cared  not to explore.    Tiring at last of this diversion, Tarzan took up his way along the  corridor which led upward from the jewel-room by a steep incline.  Winding and twisting, but always tending upward, the tunnel led him  nearer and nearer to the surface, ending finally in a low-ceiled room,  lighter than any that he had as yet discovered.    Above him an opening in the ceiling at the upper end of a flight of  concrete steps revealed a brilliant sunlit scene.  Tarzan viewed the  vine-covered columns in mild wonderment.  He puckered his brows in an  attempt to recall some recollection of similar things.  He was not sure  of himself.  There was a tantalizing suggestion always present in his  mind that something was eluding him--that he should know many things  which he did not know.    His earnest cogitation was rudely interrupted by a thunderous roar from  the opening above him.  Following the roar came the cries and screams  of men and women.  Tarzan grasped his spear more firmly and ascended  the steps.  A strange sight met his eyes as he emerged from the  semi-darkness of the cellar to the brilliant light of the temple.    The creatures he saw before him he recognized for what they were--men  and women, and a huge lion.  The men and women were scuttling for the  safety of the exits.  The lion stood upon the body of one who had been  less fortunate than the others.  He was in the center of the temple.  Directly before Tarzan, a woman stood beside a block of stone.  Upon  the top of the stone lay stretched a man, and as the ape-man watched  the scene, he saw the lion glare terribly at the two who remained  within the temple.  Another thunderous roar broke from the savage  throat, the woman screamed and swooned across the body of the man  stretched prostrate upon the stone altar before her.    The lion advanced a few steps and crouched.  The tip of his sinuous  tail twitched nervously.  He was upon the point of charging when his  eyes were attracted toward the ape-man.    Werper, helpless upon the altar, saw the great carnivore preparing to  leap upon him.  He saw the sudden change in the beast's expression as  his eyes wandered to something beyond the altar and out of the  Belgian's view.  He saw the formidable creature rise to a standing  position.  A figure darted past Werper.  He saw a mighty arm upraised,  and a stout spear shoot forward toward the lion, to bury itself in the  broad chest.    He saw the lion snapping and tearing at the weapon's shaft, and he saw,  wonder of wonders, the naked giant who had hurled the missile charging  upon the great beast, only a long knife ready to meet those ferocious  fangs and talons.    The lion reared up to meet this new enemy.  The beast was growling  frightfully, and then upon the startled ears of the Belgian, broke a  similar savage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/926"],[0,"Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted; Or, What's in a Dream (#8)"],[1,"ty, or the highest element of intelligence  reached by man.  [This circle is ``the spiritual man'' and relates  in substance to the spiritual soul of the macrocosm or universe.  It becomes strong or weak as we recognize or fail to recognize  it as a factor of being.  The process of spiritual development  is similar to that of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.  The trees on the outer rim of the forest are more capable of resisting  the wind than those more to the center, by reason of their exposure  to storms; the roots have penetrated with double strength far  into the earth, and the branches are braced with toughened bark  and closely knitted ligaments.    The same may be said of the animal kingdom.  The mind is developed  by vigorous exercise just as are likewise the muscles of the body.  The more these are cultivated by drawing from their parental affinities  in the macrocosm, the more knowledge or power they take on.  Thus as a man simulates in thought and action an ape, a tiger, a goat,  a snake or a lamb he takes on their characteristics and is swayed by  like influences to enmity, meekness, covetousness and avariciousness.  To illustrate further.  If he is cunning he draws on the fox of  the microcosm and becomes, in action and thought, like that animal.  If selfishness survives, the hog principle is aroused from its latent  cells in the microcosm and he is dominated by material appetites.  In a similar way he may perceive the spiritual in himself.  Nature's laws, with all their numberless and intricate ramifications  are simple in their harmony of process and uniformity of purpose  when applied to the physical and ethical developments of man.]    Possibilities for inner improvements or expansions rest with material man.  If he entertains gross desires to the exclusion of spiritual germs,  he will dwarf and degrade higher aspirations, and thus deprive subjective  spirituality of her rightful possessions.    * * * *      Nature, in compounding the materials for the creation of the deaf man,  inadvertently dropped the ingredient sound, hence making an imperfect being;  and sound, being thus foreign to his nature, he can only be approached  by signs even in dreams.  Subjectivity uses nature's forces,  while a normal person uses dreams to work on his waking consciousness.  As it is impossible to use with effect a factor which a man does not  naturally possess, a deaf man rarely ever dreams of sound, or a blind  man of light.    * * * *    TWO DREAMS ARE NEVER THE SAME, NOR ARE TWO FLOWERS EVER ALIKE.      Whatever symbol is used to impress the dreamer is the one  which is likely to warn him more definitely than any other.  No two persons being ever in the same state at the same time,  the same symbols would hardly convey identical impressions;  neither will the same dream be as effective in all cases  of business or love with the same dreamer.    A person's dream perception wavers, much as it does in waking hours.  You fail to find the same fragrance in the rose at all times,  though the same influences seemingly surround you; and thus it is  that different dreams must be used for different persons to convey  the same meaning.    Creation, confident of her power to perfect her designs,  does not resort to that monotony in her work, which might result  were the perception of man, or the petals and fragrance of flowers  cast from one stereotyped mold of intelligence, beauty or sweetness.  This variety of scheme runs through all creation.  You think you have identical dreams, but there is always  some variation, even if it be something dreamed immediately over.  Nature is no sluggard and is forever changing her compounds,  so that there is bound to be change in the details even of dreams.  This change would not materially affect the approach of happiness  or sorrow in different people, and hence the same dreams are  reliable for all.    Persons of the same or similar temperament will be more deeply  impressed by a certain dream than would people their opposite;  and though the dream cannot be the same in detail yet it is  apparently the same, just as two like flowers are called roses,  though they are not identical.    If a young woman twenty-five and a girl of fifteen should each have a dream  of marriage, the same definition would apply to each, just the same  as if they would each approach a flower and smell of it differently.  Different influences will possess them unconsciously, though the outward  appearance be the same.    A young woman of a certain age is warned in a dream of trouble  likely to befall her, while another of similar age and  threatened trouble is warned also, but in different symbols,  which she fails to grasp and bring back to waking existence,  and she thus believes she has had no warning dream.    There are those in the world who lack subjective strength,  material or spiritual, and hence they fail to receive dreams,  however symbolic, because there is no power within them  to retain these impressions.    There are many reasons for this loss, utter material gross-ness, want  of memory, physical weakness uncoupled from extreme nervousness,  and total lack of faith in any warning or revelation purporting  or coming from the dream consciousness.    To dream at night and the following day have the thing dreamed of  actually take place, or come before your notice, is not allegorical.  It is the higher or spiritual sense living or grasping the immediate  future ahead of the physical mind.  The spiritual body is  always first to come into contact with the approaching future;  it is present with it, while still future to the physical body.  There is no reason why man should not grasp coming events earlier,  only he does not cultivate inner sight as he does his outer senses.  The allegorical is used because man weakens his spiritual force  by catering to the material senses.    He clings to the pleasures and woes of the material world  to the exclusion of spirituality.        WHAT'S IN A DREAM.      A.      ``_When he was set down on the Judgment seat, his wife sent  unto him, saying, `Have thou nothing to do with that just man;  for I have suffered many things this day in a dream, because of him_.'  ''--Matthew xxvii, 19.    _Abandon_.    To dream that you are abandoned, denotes that you will have difficulty  in framing your plans for future success.    To abandon others, you will see unhappy conditions piled thick around you,  leaving little hope of surmounting them.    If it is your house that you abandon, you will soon come to grief  in experimenting with fortune.    If you abandon your sweetheart, you will fail to recover lost valuables,  and friends will turn aside from your favors.    If you abandon a mistress, you will unexpectedly come into  a goodly inheritance.    If it is religion you abandon, you will come to grief by your attacks  on prominent people.    To abandon children, denotes that you will lose your fortune  by lack of calmness and judgment.    To abandon your business, indicates distressing circumstances in which there  will be quarrels and suspicion.  (This dream may have a literal fulfilment  if it is impressed on your waking mind, whether you abandon a person,  or that person abandons you, or, as indicated, it denotes other worries.)    To see yourself or friend abandon a ship, suggests your possible  entanglement in some business failure, but if you escape to shore  your interests will remain secure.      _Abbey_.[3]    To see an abbey in ruins, foretells that your hopes and schemes  will fall into ignoble incompletion.    To dream that a priest bars your entrance into an abbey,  denotes that you will be saved from a ruinous state by enemies  mistaking your embarrassment for progress.    For a young woman to get into an abbey, foretells her violent illness.  If she converses with a priest in an abbey, she will incur the censure  of true friends for indiscretion.    _Abbess_.    For a young woman to dream that she sees an abbess, denotes that she  will be compelled to perform distasteful tasks, and will submit  to authority only after unsuccessful rebellion.    To dream of an abbess smiling and benignant, denotes you will be surrounded  by true friends and pleasing prospects.    _Abbot_.[3]    To dream that you are an abbot, warns you that treacherous plots  are being laid for your downfall.    If you see this pious man in devotional exercises, it forewarns  you of smooth flattery and deceit pulling you a willing victim  into the meshes of artful bewilderment.    For a young woman to talk with an abbot, portends that she will yield to  insinuating flatteries, and in yielding she will besmirch her reputation.  If she marries one, she will uphold her name and honor despite  poverty and temptation.    [3] See similar words in connection with churches, priests, etc.    _Abdomen_.[4]    To see your abdomen in a dream, foretells that you will have  great expectations, but you must curb hardheadedness and redouble  your energies on your labor, as pleasure is approaching to your hurt.    To see your abdomen shriveled, foretells that you will be persecuted  and defied by false friends.    To see it swollen, you will have tribulations, but you will overcome them  and enjoy the fruits of your labor.    To see blood oozing from the abdomen, foretells an accident or tragedy  in your family.    The abdomen of children in an unhealthy state, portends that contagion  will pursue you.    [4] See Belly.    _Abhor_.    To dream that you abhor a person, denotes that you will entertain  strange dislike for some person, and your suspicion of his honesty  will prove correct.    To think yourself held in abhorrence by others, predicts that your good  intentions to others will subside into selfishness.    For a young woman to dream that her lover abhors her, foretells that she  will love a man who is in no sense congenial.    _Abject_.    To dream that you are abject, denotes that you will"]]]
