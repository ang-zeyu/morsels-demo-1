He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga  girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly.  Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail  as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and  offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to  part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value,  and refused to sell it.    It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a  village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for  something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high  price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him  his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed  upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the  latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While  he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted  their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his  instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to  return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart,  leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used  to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth  delighted the ears of all who heard it.    When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the  Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the  family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the  chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust,  re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of  the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this  manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble  themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however,  was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so  attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, \"I will catch her  to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed  before the others.\" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of  firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and  began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the  meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the  young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter  the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught  her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, \"Fie! Fie! you may be a  Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot  marry.\" He said, \"No. But from to-day, you and I are one.\" So they  began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others  returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being  and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly.    Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and  her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit.    The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she  was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set  cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in  wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been  subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her,  and wound up by saying, \"You must have known it all, and yet you did  not interfere to save me.\" And that was all the revenge she took.    [Illustration:]          The Cruel Crane Outwitted    [Illustration:]      Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree  standing near a certain lotus pond.    Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a  certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish.  And a crane thought on seeing the fish:    \"I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them.\"    And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he  should do it.    When the fish saw him, they asked him, \"What are you sitting there  for, lost in thought?\"    \"I am sitting thinking about you,\" said he.    \"Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?\" said they.    \"Why,\" he replied; \"there is very little water in this pond, and but  little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking,  'What in the world will these fish do now?'\"    \"Yes, indeed, sir! what _are_ we to do?\" said they.    \"If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a  fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you  into it,\" answered the crane.    \"That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard  of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other,  that you're aiming at.\"    \"Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't  believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go  and see it.\"    Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number--a  big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any  emergency, afloat or ashore.    Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the  whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other  fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond.    And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, \"All right, sir! You  may take us with you.\"    Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the  other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there.  But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and  killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the  foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:    \"I've thrown that fish in; let another one come.\"    And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them,  till he came back and found no more!    But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he  would eat him too, and called out:    \"I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a  fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!\"    \"But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?\"    \"I'll bite hold of you with my beak.\"    \"You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!\"    \"Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way.\"    Then said the crab to himself, \"If this fellow once got hold of fish,  he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me  into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't--then I'll cut  his throat, and kill him!\" So he said to him:    \"Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we  crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the  neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you.\"    And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and  agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely  as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, \"Off with you,  now!\"    And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off  towards the Varana-tree.    \"Uncle!\" cried the crab, \"the pond lies that way, but you are taking  me this way!\"    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" answered the crane. \"Your dear little uncle,  your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I  suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you  about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at  the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every  one of them, just so I will devour you as well!\"    \"Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,\" answered the  crab; \"but I'm not going to let you eat _me_. On the contrary, is it  _you_ that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen  that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will  cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!\" And so saying,  he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice.    Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling  with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, \"O my Lord!  Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!\"    \"Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there.\"    And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the  crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as  clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then  only entered the water!    When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair,  he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant  voice the verse:        \"The villain, though exceeding clever,      Shall prosper not by his villainy.      He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,      But only as the Crane here from the Crab!\"    [Illustration:]          Loving Laili      Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees  and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun,  who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red  cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing  with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which  was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees.  They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat  them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and  write.    One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said  to his father, \"Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt.\" His  father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else  they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country,  hunting "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#8)"],[1,"ulman, determined, if possible, to put an end to  the dismay which was rapidly paralyzing the exertions of his best  soldiers. Taking a huge cross-bow, he stood forward in front of the  army, to try the steadiness of his hand against the much-dreaded  archer: the shaft was aimed directly at his heart, and took fatal  effect. The Moslem fell amid the groans of the besieged, and the shouts  of Deus adjuva! Deus adjuva! the war-cry of the besiegers.    At last the crusaders imagined that they had overcome all obstacles,  and were preparing to take possession of the city, when to their great  astonishment they saw the flag of the Emperor Alexius flying from the  battlements. An emissary of the Emperor, named Faticius or Tatin, had  contrived to gain admission with a body of Greek troops at a point  which the crusaders had left unprotected, and had persuaded the Turks  to surrender to him rather than to the crusading forces. The greatest  indignation prevailed in the army when this stratagem was discovered,  and the soldiers were, with the utmost difficulty, prevented from  renewing the attack and besieging the Greek emissary.    The army, however, continued its march, and by some means or other was  broken into two divisions; some historians say accidentally, [Fulcher  of Chartres.--Guibert de Nogent.--Vital.] while others affirm by mutual  consent, and for the convenience of obtaining provisions on the way.  [William of Tyre.--Mills.--Wilken, &c.] The one division was composed  of the forces under Bohemund, Tancred, and the Duke of Normandy; while  the other, which took a route at some distance on the right, was  commanded by Godfrey of Bouillon and the other chiefs. The Sultan of  Roum, who, after his losses at Nice, had been silently making great  efforts to crush the crusaders at one blow, collected in a very short  time all the multitudinous tribes that owed him allegiance, and with an  army which, according to a moderate calculation, amounted to two  hundred thousand men, chiefly cavalry, he fell upon the first division  of the Christian host in the valley of Dorylaeum. It was early in the  morning of the 1st of July 1097, when the crusaders saw the first  companies of the Turkish horsemen pouring down upon them from the  hills. Bohemund had hardly time to set himself in order, and transport  his sick and helpless to the rear, when the overwhelming force of the  Orientals was upon him. The Christian army, composed principally of men  on foot, gave way on all sides, and the hoofs of the Turkish steeds,  and the poisoned arrows of their bowmen, mowed them down by hundreds.  After having lost the flower of their chivalry, the Christians  retreated upon their baggage, when a dreadful slaughter took place.  Neither women nor children, nor the sick, were spared. Just as they  were reduced to the last extremity, Godfrey of Bouillon and the Count  of Toulouse made their appearance on the field, and turned the tide of  battle. After an obstinate engagement the Turks fled, and their rich  camp fell into the bands of the enemy. The loss of the crusaders  amounted to about four thousand men, with several chiefs of renown,  among whom were Count Robert of Paris and William the brother of  Tancred. The loss of the Turks, which did not exceed this number,  taught them to pursue a different mode of warfare. The Sultan was far  from being defeated. With his still gigantic army, he laid waste all  the country on either side of the crusaders. The latter, who were  unaware of the tactics of the enemy, found plenty of provisions in the  Turkish camp; but so far from economizing these resources, they gave  themselves up for several days to the most unbounded extravagance. They  soon paid dearly for their heedlessness.  In the ravaged country of  Phrygia, through which they advanced towards Antiochetta, they suffered  dreadfully for want of food for themselves and pasture for their  cattle. Above them was a scorching sun, almost sufficient of itself to  dry up the freshness of the land, a task which the firebrands of the  Sultan had but too surely effected, and water was not to be had after  the first day of their march. The pilgrims died at the rate of five  hundred a-day. The horses of the knights perished on the road, and the  baggage which they had aided to transport, was either placed upon dogs,  sheep, and swine, or abandoned altogether. In some of the calamities  that afterwards befell them, the Christians gave themselves up to the  most reckless profligacy; but upon this occasion, the dissensions which  prosperity had engendered, were all forgotten. Religion, often  disregarded, arose in the stern presence of misfortune, and cheered  them as they died by the promises of eternal felicity.    At length they reached Antiochetta, where they found water in  abundance, and pastures for their expiring cattle. Plenty once more  surrounded them, and here they pitched their tents. Untaught by the  bitter experience of famine, they again gave themselves up to luxury  and waste.    On the 18th of October they sat down before the strong city of Antioch,  the siege of which, and the events to which it gave rise, are among the  most extraordinary incidents of the Crusade. The city, which is  situated on an eminence, and washed by the river Orontes, is naturally  a very strong position, and the Turkish garrison were well supplied  with provisions to endure a long siege. In this respect the Christians  were also fortunate, but, unluckily for themselves, unwise.  Their  force amounted to three hundred thousand fighting men; and we are  informed by Raymond d'Argilles, that they had so much provision, that  they threw away the greater part of every animal they killed, being so  dainty, that they would only eat particular parts of the beast. So  insane was their extravagance, that in less than ten days famine began  to stare them in the face. After making a fruitless attempt to gain  possession of the city by a coup de main, they, starving themselves,  sat down to starve out the enemy. But with want came a cooling of  enthusiasm. The chiefs began to grow weary of the expedition. Baldwin  had previously detached himself from the main body of the army, and,  proceeding to Edessa, had intrigued himself into the supreme power in  that little principality. The other leaders were animated with less  zeal than heretofore. Stephen of Chartres and Hugh of Vermandois began  to waver, unable to endure the privations which their own folly and  profusion had brought upon them. Even Peter the Hermit became sick at  heart ere all was over. When the famine had become so urgent that they  were reduced to eat human flesh in the extremity of their hunger,  Bohemund and Robert of Flanders set forth on an expedition to procure a  supply. They were in a slight degree successful; but the relief they  brought was not economized, and in two days they were as destitute as  before. Faticius, the Greek commander and representative of Alexius,  deserted with his division under pretence of seeking for food, and his  example was followed by various bodies of crusaders.    Misery was rife among those who remained, and they strove to alleviate  it by a diligent attention to signs and omens. These, with  extraordinary visions seen by the enthusiastic, alternately cheered and  depressed them according as they foretold the triumph or pictured the  reverses of the Cross. At one time a violent hurricane arose, levelling  great trees with the ground, and blowing down the tents of the  Christian leaders. At another time an earthquake shook the camp, and  was thought to prognosticate some great impending evil to the cause of  Christendom. But a comet which appeared shortly afterwards, raised them  from the despondency into which they had fallen; their lively  imaginations making it assume the form of a flaming cross leading them  on to victory. Famine was not the least of the evils they endured.  Unwholesome food, and the impure air from the neighbouring marshes,  engendered pestilential diseases, which carried them off more rapidly  than the arrows of the enemy. A thousand of them died in a day, and it  became at last a matter of extreme difficulty to afford them burial. To  add to their misery, each man grew suspicious of his neighbour; for the  camp was infested by Turkish spies, who conveyed daily to the besieged  intelligence of the movements and distresses of the enemy. With a  ferocity, engendered by despair, Bohemund caused two spies, whom he had  detected, to be roasted alive in presence of the army, and within sight  of the battlements of Antioch. But even this example failed to reduce  their numbers, and the Turks continued to be as well informed as the  Christians themselves of all that was passing in the camp.    The news of the arrival of a reinforcement of soldiers from Europe,  with an abundant stock of provisions, came to cheer them when reduced  to the last extremity. The welcome succour landed at St.  Simeon, the  port of Antioch, and about six miles from that city.  Thitherwards the  famishing crusaders proceeded in tumultuous bands, followed by Bohemund  and the Count of Toulouse, with strong detachments of their retainers  and vassals, to escort the supplies in safety to the camp. The garrison  of Antioch, forewarned of this arrival, was on the alert, and a corps  of Turkish archers was despatched to lie in ambuscade among the  mountains and intercept their return. Bohemund, laden with provisions,  was encountered in the rocky passes by the Turkish host. Great numbers  of his followers were slain, and he himself had just time to escape to  the camp with the news of his defeat. Godfrey of Bouillon, the Duke of  Normandy, and the other leaders had heard the rumour of this battle,  and were at that instant preparing for the rescue. The army was  immediately in motion, animated both by zeal and by hunger, and marched  so rapidly as to intercept the victorious"]]]
