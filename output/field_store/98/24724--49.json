The island is dedicated to Siva, the demon god of the Hindus, and  it is therefore appropriate that its swamps and jungles should  abound with poisonous reptiles and insects. The largest of the  several temples is 130 feet square and from 32 to 58 feet high,  an artificial cave chiseled out of the granite mountain side.  The roof is sustained by sixteen pilasters and twenty-six massive  fluted pillars. In a recess in the center is a gigantic figure  of Siva in his character as The Destroyer. His face is turned to  the east and wears a stern, commanding expression. His head-dress  is elaborate and crowned by a tiara beautifully carved. In one  hand he holds a citron and in the other the head of a cobra,  which is twisted around his arm and is reaching towards his face.  His neck is adorned with strings of pearls, from which hangs  a pendant in the form of a heart. Another necklace supports a  human skull, the peculiar symbol of Siva, with twisted snakes  growing from the head instead of hair. This is the great image  of the temple and represents the most cruel and revengeful of all  the Hindu gods. Ten centuries ago he wore altogether a different  character, but human sacrifices have always been made to propitiate  him. Around the walls of the cave are other gods of smaller stature  representing several of the most prominent and powerful of the  Hindu pantheon, all of them chiseled from the solid granite.  There are several chambers or chapels also for different forms of  worship, and a well which receives its water from some mysterious  source, and is said to be very deep.    The Portuguese did great damage here several centuries ago in  a war with India, for they fired several cannon balls straight  into the mouth of the cave, which carried away several of the  columns and destroyed the ornamentation of others, but the Royal  Asiatic Society has taken the trouble to make careful and accurate  repairs.    Although the caves at Elephanta are wonderful, they are greatly  inferior in size and beauty to a larger group at Ellora, a day's  journey by train from Bombay, and after that a carriage or horseback  ride of two hours. There are 100 cave temples, carved out of  the solid rock between the second and the tenth centuries. They  are scattered along the base of a range of beautifully wooded  hills about 500 feet above the plain, and the amount of labor and  patience expended in their construction is appalling, especially  when one considers that the men who made them were without the  appliances and tools of modern times, knew nothing of explosives  and were dependent solely upon chisels of flint and other stones.  The greatest and finest of them is as perfect in its details and  as elaborate in its ornamentations as the cathedrals at Milan  or Toledo, except that it has been cut out of a single piece of  stone instead of being built up of many small pieces.    The architect made his plans with the most prodigal detail and  executed them with the greatest perfection. He took a solid rock,  an absolute monolith, and chiseled out of it a cathedral 365  feet long, 192 feet wide and 96 feet high, with four rows of  mighty columns sustaining a vaulted roof that is covered with  pictures in relief illustrating the power and the adventures  and the achievements of his gods. It would accommodate 5,000  worshippers. Around the walls he left rough projections, which  were afterward carved into symbolical figures and images, eight,  ten and twelve feet high, of elephants lions, tigers, oxen, rams,  swans and eagles, larger than life. Corner niches and recesses  have been enriched with the most intricate ornamentation, and  in them, still of the same rock, without the introduction of  an atom of outside material, the sculptors chiseled the figures  of forty or more of the principal Hindu deities. And on each  of the four sides is a massive altar carved out of the side of  the cliff with the most ornate and elaborate traceries and other  embellishment.    Indeed, my pen is not capable of describing these most wonderful  achievements of human genius and patience. But all of them have  been described in great detail and with copious illustrations  in books that refer to nothing else. I can only say that they  are the most wonderful of all the human monuments in India.      \"From one vast mount of solid stone    A mighty temple has been cored    By nut-brown children of the sun,    When stars were newly bright, and blithe    Of song along the rim of dawn--    A mighty monolith.\"    The thirty principal temples are scattered along the rocky mountain  side within a distance of two miles, and seventy-nine others are  in the immediate neighborhood. The smallest of the principal group  is 90 feet long, 40 feet wide, with a roof 40 feet high sustained  by thirty-four columns. They are all alike in one particular. No  mortar was used in their construction or any outside material.  Every atom of the walls and ceilings, the columns, the altars  and the images and ornaments stands exactly where the Creator  placed it at the birth of the universe.    There are several groups of cave temples in the same neighborhood.  Some of them were made by the Buddhists, for it seems to have  been fashionable in those days to chisel places of worship out  of the rocky hillsides instead of erecting them in the open air,  according to the ordinary rules of architecture. There are not  less than 300 in western India which are believed to have been  made within a period of a thousand years. Archaeologists dispute  over their ages, just as they disagree about everything else. Some  claim that the first of the cave temples antedates the Christian  era; others declare that the oldest was not begun for 300 years  after Christ, but to the ordinary citizen these are questions of  little significance. It is not so important for us to know when  this great work was done, but it would be extremely gratifying if  somebody could tell us who did it--what genius first conceived  the idea of carving a magnificent house of worship out of the  heart of a mountain, and what means he used to accomplish the  amazing results.    We would like to know for example, who made the designs of the  Vishwa Karma, or carpenter's cave, one of the most exquisite in  India, a single excavation 85 by 45 feet in area and 35 feet  high, which has an arched roof similar to the Gothic chapels  of England and a balcony or gallery over a richly sculptured  gateway very similar to the organ loft of a modern church. At  the upper end, sitting cross-legged in a niche, is a figure four  feet high, with a serene and contemplative expression upon its  face. Because it has none of the usual signs and symbols and  ornaments that appertain to the different gods, archaeologists  have pronounced it a figure of the founder of the temple, who,  according to a popular legend, carved it all with his own hands,  but there is nothing to indicate for whom the statue was intended,  and the various stories told of it are pure conjectures that only  exasperate one who studies the details. Each stroke of the chisel  upon the surface of the interior was as delicate and exact as  if a jewel instead of a granite mountain was being carved.    There are temples to all of the great gods in the Hindu catalogue;  there are several in honor of Buddha, and others for Jain, all  more or less of the same design and the same style of execution.  Those who care to know more about them can find full descriptions  in Fergusson's \"Indian Architecture.\"    South of Bombay, on the coast, is the little Portuguese colony  of Goa, the oldest European settlement in India. You will be  surprised to know that there are four or five of these colonies  belonging to other European governments within the limits of British  India, entirely independent of the viceroy and the authority of  Edward VII. The French have two towns of limited area in Bengal,  one of them only an hour's ride from Calcutta. They are entirely  outside of the British jurisdiction and under the authority of  the French Republic, which has always been respected. The Dutch  have two colonies in India also, and Goa, the most important of  all, is subject to Portugal. The territory is sixty-two miles  long by forty miles wide, and has a population of 446,982. The  inhabitants are nearly all Roman Catholics, and the archbishop  of Goa is primate of the East, having jurisdiction over all Roman  Catholics between Cairo and Hong-Kong.    More than half of the population are converted Hindus, descendants  of the original occupants of the place, who were overcome by  the Duke of Albuquerque in 1510, and after seventy or eighty  years of fighting were converted by the celebrated and saintly  Jesuit missionary, St. Francis Xavier. He lived and preached  and died in Goa, and was buried in the Church of the Good Jesus,  which was erected by him during the golden age of Portugal--for  at one time that little kingdom exercised a military, political,  ecclesiastical and commercial influence throughout the world  quite as great, comparatively speaking, as that of Great Britain  to-day. Goa was then the most important city in the East, for  its wealth and commerce rivaled that of Genoa or Venice. It was  as large as Paris or London, and the viceroy lived in a palace  as fine as that occupied by the king. But very little evidence of  its former magnificence remains. Its grandeur was soon exhausted  when the Dutch and the East India Company came into competition  with the Portuguese. The Latin race has never been tenacious either  in politics or commerce. Like the Spaniards, the Portuguese have  no staying power, and after a struggle lasting seventy years,  all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#9)"],[1,"under a  necessity of conceiving themselves as at least abstaining from all the  grosser injuries, and (if only for their own protection.) living in a  state of constant protest against them. They are also familiar with the  fact of co-operating with others, and proposing to themselves a  collective, not an individual, interest, as the aim (at least for the  time being) of their actions. So long as they are co-operating, their  ends are identified with those of others; there is at least a temporary  feeling that the interests of others are their own interests. Not only  does all strengthening of social ties, and all healthy growth of  society, give to each individual a stronger personal interest in  practically consulting the welfare of others; it also leads him to  identify his feelings more and more with their good, or at least with  an ever greater degree of practical consideration for it. He comes, as  though instinctively, to be conscious of himself as a being who _of  course_ pays regard to others. The good of others becomes to him a thing  naturally and necessarily to be attended to, like any of the physical  conditions of our existence. Now, whatever amount of this feeling a  person has, he is urged by the strongest motives both of interest and of  sympathy to demonstrate it, and to the utmost of his power encourage it  in others; and even if he has none of it himself, he is as greatly  interested as any one else that others should have it. Consequently, the  smallest germs of the feeling are laid hold of and nourished by the  contagion of sympathy and the influences of education; and a complete  web of corroborative association is woven round it, by the powerful  agency of the external sanctions. This mode of conceiving ourselves and  human life, as civilization goes on, is felt to be more and more  natural. Every step in political improvement renders it more so, by  removing the sources of opposition of interest, and levelling those  inequalities of legal privilege between individuals or classes, owing to  which there are large portions of mankind whose happiness it is still  practicable to disregard. In an improving state of the human mind, the  influences are constantly on the increase, which tend to generate in  each individual a feeling of unity with all the rest; which feeling, if  perfect, would make him never think of, or desire, any beneficial  condition for himself, in the benefits of which they are not included.  If we now suppose this feeling of unity to be taught as a religion, and  the whole force of education, of institutions, and of opinion,  directed, as it once was in the case of religion, to make every person  grow up from infancy surrounded on all sides both by the profession and  by the practice of it, I think that no one, who can realize this  conception, will feel any misgiving about the sufficiency of the  ultimate sanction for the Happiness morality. To any ethical student who  finds the realization difficult, I recommend, as a means of facilitating  it, the second of M. Comte's two principal works, the _Systeme de  Politique Positive_. I entertain the strongest objections to the system  of politics and morals set forth in that treatise; but I think it has  superabundantly shown the possibility of giving to the service of  humanity, even without the aid of belief in a Providence, both the  physical power and the social efficacy of a religion; making it take  hold of human life, and colour all thought, feeling, and action, in a  manner of which the greatest ascendency ever exercised by any religion  may be but a type and foretaste; and of which the danger is, not that it  should be insufficient, but that it should be so excessive as to  interfere unduly with human freedom and individuality.    Neither is it necessary to the feeling which constitutes the binding  force of the utilitarian morality on those who recognize it, to wait for  those social influences which would make its obligation felt by mankind  at large. In the comparatively early state of human advancement in which  we now live, a person cannot indeed feel that entireness of sympathy  with all others, which would make any real discordance in the general  direction of their conduct in life impossible; but already a person in  whom the social feeling is at all developed, cannot bring himself to  think of the rest of his fellow creatures as struggling rivals with him  for the means of happiness, whom he must desire to see defeated in their  object in order that he may succeed in his. The deeply-rooted conception  which every individual even now has of himself as a social being, tends  to make him feel it one of his natural wants that there should be  harmony between his feelings and aims and those of his fellow creatures.  If differences of opinion and of mental culture make it impossible for  him to share many of their actual feelings-perhaps make him denounce and  defy those feelings-he still needs to be conscious that his real aim and  theirs do not conflict; that he is not opposing himself to what they  really wish for, namely, their own good, but is, on the contrary,  promoting it. This feeling in most individuals is much inferior in  strength to their selfish feelings, and is often wanting altogether. But  to those who have it, it possesses all the characters of a natural  feeling. It does not present itself to their minds as a superstition of  education, or a law despotically imposed by the power of society, but as  an attribute which it would not be well for them to be without. This  conviction is the ultimate sanction of the greatest-happiness morality.  This it is which makes any mind, of well-developed feelings, work with,  and not against, the outward motives to care for others, afforded by  what I have called the external sanctions; and when those sanctions are  wanting, or act in an opposite direction, constitutes in itself a  powerful internal binding force, in proportion to the sensitiveness and  thoughtfulness of the character; since few but those whose mind is a  moral blank, could bear to lay out their course of life on the plan of  paying no regard to others except so far as their own private interest  compels.          CHAPTER IV.      OF WHAT SORT OF PROOF THE PRINCIPLE OF UTILITY IS SUSCEPTIBLE.    It has already been remarked, that questions of ultimate ends do not  admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term. To be incapable  of proof by reasoning is common to all first principles; to the first  premises of our knowledge, as well as to those of our conduct. But the  former, being matters of fact, may be the subject of a direct appeal to  the faculties which judge of fact--namely, our senses, and our internal  consciousness. Can an appeal be made to the same faculties on questions  of practical ends? Or by what other faculty is cognizance taken of them?    Questions about ends are, in other words, questions what things are  desirable. The utilitarian doctrine is, that happiness is desirable, and  the only thing desirable, as an end; all other things being only  desirable as means to that end. What ought to be required of this  doctrine--what conditions is it requisite that the doctrine should  fulfil--to make good its claim to be believed?    The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that  people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible, is that  people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience. In like  manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to produce that  anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire it. If the end  which the utilitarian doctrine proposes to itself were not, in theory  and in practice, acknowledged to be an end, nothing could ever convince  any person that it was so. No reason can be given why the general  happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes  it to be attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a  fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all  which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each  person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness,  therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons. Happiness has made  out its title as _one_ of the ends of conduct, and consequently one of  the criteria of morality.    But it has not, by this alone, proved itself to be the sole criterion.  To do that, it would seem, by the same rule, necessary to show, not only  that people desire happiness, but that they never desire anything else.  Now it is palpable that they do desire things which, in common language,  are decidedly distinguished from happiness. They desire, for example,  virtue, and the absence of vice, no less really than pleasure and the  absence of pain. The desire of virtue is not as universal, but it is as  authentic a fact, as the desire of happiness. And hence the opponents of  the utilitarian standard deem that they have a right to infer that there  are other ends of human action besides happiness, and that happiness is  not the standard of approbation and disapprobation.    But does the utilitarian doctrine deny that people desire virtue, or  maintain that virtue is not a thing to be desired? The very reverse. It  maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be  desired disinterestedly, for itself. Whatever may be the opinion of  utilitarian moralists as to the original conditions by which virtue is  made virtue; however they may believe (as they do) that actions and  dispositions are only virtuous because they promote another end than  virtue; yet this being granted, and it having been decided, from  considerations of this description, what _is_ virtuous, they not only  place virtue at the very head of the things which are good as means to  the ultimate end, but they also recognise as a psychological fact the  possibility of its"]]]
