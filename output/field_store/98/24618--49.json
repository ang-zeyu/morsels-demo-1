[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8190"],[0,"A Wodehouse Miscellany: Articles & Stories (#8)"],[1,"day after the conversation above recorded had taken place a  terrible tragedy occurred.    The colonel, returning from a poor day's shooting, observed through  the mist that was beginning to rise a small form busily engaged in  excavating in the precious carnation-bed. Slipping in a cartridge, he  fired; and the skill which had deserted him during the day came back  to him. There was a yelp; then silence. And Sylvia, rushing out from  the house, found the luckless Thomas breathing his last on a heap of  uprooted carnations.    The news was not long in spreading. The cook told the postman, and the  postman thoughtfully handed it on to the servants at the rest of the  houses on his round. By noon it was public property; and in the  afternoon, at various times from two to five, nineteen young men were  struck, quite independently of one another, with a brilliant idea.    The results of this idea were apparent on the following day.    \"Is this all?\" asked the colonel of the servant, as she brought in a  couple of letters at breakfast-time.    \"There's a hamper for Miss Sylvia, sir.\"    \"A hamper, is there? Well, bring it in.\"    \"If you please, sir, there's several of them.\"    \"What? Several? How many are there?\"    \"Nineteen, sir,\" said Mary, restraining with some difficulty an  inclination to giggle.    \"Eh? What? Nineteen? Nonsense! Where are they?\"    \"We've put them in the coachhouse for the present, sir. And if you  please, sir, cook says she thinks there's something alive in them.\"    \"Something alive?\"    \"Yes, sir. And John says he thinks it's dogs, sir!\"    The colonel uttered a sound that was almost a bark, and, followed by  Sylvia, rushed to the coachhouse. There, sure enough, as far as the  eye could reach, were the hampers; and, as they looked, a sound  proceeded from one of them that was unmistakably the plaintive note of  a dog that has been shut up, and is getting tired of it.    Instantly the other eighteen hampers joined in, until the whole  coachhouse rang with the noise.    The colonel subsided against a wall, and began to express himself  softly in Hindustani.    \"Poor dears!\" said Sylvia. \"How stuffy they must be feeling!\"    She ran to the house, and returned with a basin of water.    \"Poor dears!\" she said again. \"You'll soon have something to drink.\"    She knelt down by the nearest hamper, and cut the cord that fastened  it. A pug jumped out like a jack-in-the-box, and rushed to the water.  Sylvia continued her work of mercy, and by the time the colonel had  recovered sufficiently to be able to express his views in English,  eighteen more pugs had joined their companion.    \"Get out, you brute!\" shouted the colonel, as a dog insinuated itself  between his legs. \"Sylvia, put them back again this minute! You had no  business to let them out. Put them back!\"    \"But I can't, papa. I can't catch them.\"    She looked helplessly from him to the seething mass of dogs, and back  again.    \"Where's my gun?\" began the colonel.    \"Papa, don't! You couldn't be so cruel! They aren't doing any harm,  poor things!\"    \"If I knew who sent them----\"    \"Perhaps there's something to show. Yes; here's a visiting-card in  this hamper.\"    \"Whose is it?\" bellowed the colonel through the din.    \"J. D'Arcy Henderson, The Firs,\" read Sylvia, at the top of her voice.    \"Young blackguard!\" bawled the colonel.    \"I expect there's one in each of the hampers. Yes; here's another. W.  K. Ross, The Elms.\"    The colonel came across, and began to examine the hampers with his own  hand. Each hamper contained a visiting-card, and each card bore the  name of a neighbour. The colonel returned to the breakfast-room, and  laid the nineteen cards out in a row on the table.    \"H'm!\" he said, at last. \"Mr. Reginald Dallas does not seem to be  represented.\"    Sylvia said nothing.    \"No; he seems not to be represented. I did not give him credit for so  much sense.\" Then he dropped the subject, and breakfast proceeded in  silence.    A young gentleman met the colonel on his walk that morning.    \"Morning, colonel!\" said he.    \"Good-morning!\" said the colonel grimly.    \"Er--colonel, I--er--suppose Miss Reynolds got that dog all right?\"    \"To which dog do you refer?\"    \"It was a pug, you know. It ought to have arrived by this time.\"    \"Yes. I am inclined to think it has. Had it any special  characteristics?\"    \"No, I don't think so. Just an ordinary pug.\"    \"Well, young man, if you will go to my coachhouse, you will find  nineteen ordinary pugs; and if you would kindly select your beast, and  shoot it, I should be much obliged.\"    \"Nineteen?\" said the other, in astonishment. \"Why, are you setting up  as a dog-fancier in your old age, colonel?\"    This was too much for the colonel. He exploded.    \"Old age! Confound your impudence! Dog-fancier! No, sir! I have not  become a dog-fancier in what you are pleased to call my old age! But  while there is no law to prevent a lot of dashed young puppies like  yourself, sir--like yourself--sending your confounded pug-dogs to my  daughter, who ought to have known better than to have let them out of  their dashed hampers, I have no defence.    \"Dog-fancier! Gad! Unless those dogs are removed by this time  to-morrow, sir, they will go straight to the Battersea Home, where I  devoutly trust they will poison them. Here are the cards of the other  gentlemen who were kind enough to think that I might wish to set up  for a dog-fancier in my old age. Perhaps you will kindly return them  to their owners, and tell them what I have just said.\" And he strode  off, leaving the young man in a species of trance.    \"Sylvia!\" said the colonel, on arriving home.    \"Yes, papa.\"    \"Do you still want to marry that Dallas fellow? Now, for Heaven's  sake, don't start crying! Goodness knows I've been worried enough this  morning without that. Please answer a plain question in a fairly sane  manner. Do you, or do you not?\"    \"Of course I do, papa.\"    \"Then you may. He's the furthest from being a fool of any of the young  puppies who live about here, and he knows one end of a gun from the  other. I'll write to him now.\"        \"Dear Dallas\" (wrote the colonel),--\"I find, on consideration,      that you are the only sensible person in the neighbourhood. I hope      you will come to lunch to-day. And if you still want to marry      my daughter, you may.\"    To which Dallas replied by return of messenger:        \"Thanks for both invitations. I will.\"    An hour later he arrived in person, and the course of true love pulled  itself together, and began to run smooth again.          TOM, DICK, AND HARRY      This story will interest and amuse all cricketers, and while from the  male point of view it may serve as a good illustration of the  fickleness of woman and the impossibility of forecasting what course  she will take, the fair sex will find in it an equally shining proof  of the colossal vanity of man.    \"It's like this.\"    Tom Ellison sat down on the bed, and paused.    \"Whack it out,\" said Dick Henley encouragingly.    \"We're all friends here, and the password's 'Portland.' What's the  matter?\"    \"I hate talking to a man when he's shaving. I don't want to have you  cutting your head off.\"    \"Don't worry about me. This is a safety razor. And, anyhow, what's the  excitement? Going to make my flesh creep?\"    Tom Ellison kicked uncomfortably at the chair he was trying to balance  on one leg.    \"It's so hard to explain.\"    \"Have a dash at it.\"    \"Well, look here, Dick, we've always been pals. What?\"    \"Of course we have.\"    \"We went to the Empire last Boatrace night together----\"    \"And got chucked out simultaneously.\"    \"In fact, we've always been pals. What?\"    \"Of course we have.\"    \"Then, whenever there was a rag on, and a bonner in the quad, you  always knew you could help yourself to my chairs.\"    \"You had the run of mine.\"    \"We've shared each other's baccy.\"    \"And whisky.\"    \"In short, we've always been pals. What?\"    \"Of course we have.\"    \"Then,\" said Tom Ellison, \"what are you trying to cut me out for?\"    \"Cut you out?\"    \"You know what I mean. What do you think I came here for? To play  cricket? Rot! I'd much rather have gone on tour with the Authentics. I  came here to propose to Dolly Burn.\"    Dick Henley frowned.    \"I wish you'd speak of her as Miss Burn,\" he said austerely.    \"There you are, you see,\" said Tom with sombre triumph; \"you oughtn't  to have noticed a thing like that. It oughtn't to matter to you what I  call her. I always think of her as Dolly.\"    \"You've no right to.\"    \"I shall have soon.\"    \"I'll bet you won't.\"    \"How much?\"    \"Ten to one in anything.\"    \"Done,\" said Tom. \"I mean,\" he added hastily, \"don't be a fool. There  are some things one can't bet on. As you ought to have known,\" he said  primly.    \"Now, look here,\" said Dick, \"this thing has got to be settled. You say  I'm trying to cut you out. I like that! We may fairly describe that as  rich. As if my love were the same sort of passing fancy that yours is.  You know you fall in love, as you call it, with every girl you meet.\"    \"I don't.\"    \"Very well. If the subject is painful we won't discuss it. Still, how  about that girl you used to rave about last summer? Ethel Something?\"    Tom blushed.    \"A mere platonic friendship. We both collected autographs. And, if it  comes to that, how about Dora Thingummy? You had enough to say about  her last winter.\"    Dick reddened.    \"We were on good terms. Nothing more. She always sliced with her  brassy. So did I. It formed a sort of bond.\"    There was a pause.    \"After all,\" resumed Dick, \"I don't see the point of all this. Why  rake up the past? You aren't writing my life.\"    \"You started raking.\"    \"Well, to drop that, what do you propose to do about this? You're a  good chap, Tom, when you aren't making an ass of yourself; but I'm  hanged if I'm going to have you interfering between me and Dolly.\"    \"Miss Burn.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8220"],[0,"Remarks (#8)"],[1," your business might suffer while you were away, and so I will close,  but I hope that anyone now within the sound of my voice, and in whose  breast a sudden hunger for more light on this great subject may have  sprung up, will feel perfectly free to call on me and ask me about it or  immerse himself in the numerous tomes that I have collected from friends,  and which relate to this matter.    In closing I wish to say that I have made no statements in this paper  relative to evolution which I am not prepared to prove; and, if anything,  I have been over-conservative. For that reason I say now, that the person  who doubts a single fact as I have given it to-night, bearing upon the  great subject of evolution, will have to do so over my dumb remains.    And a man who will do that is no gentleman. I presume that many of these  statements will be snapped up and sharply criticised by other theologians  and many of our foremost thinkers, but they will do well to pause before  they draw me into a controversy, for I have other facts in relation to  evolution, and some personal reminiscences and family history, which I am  prepared to introduce, if necessary, together with ideas that I have  thought up myself. So I say to those who may hope to attract notice and  obtain notoriety by drawing me into a controversy, beware. It will be to  your interest to beware!          Hours With Great Men.    I presume that I could write an entire library of personal reminiscences  relative to the eminent people with whom I have been thrown during a busy  life, but I hate to do it, because I always regarded such things as sacred  from the vulgar eye, and I felt bound to respect the confidence of a  prominent man just as much as I would that of one who was less before the  people. I remember very well my first meeting with General W.T. Sherman.  I would not mention it here if it were not for the fact that the people  seem so be yearning for personal reminiscences of great men, and that is  perfectly right, too.    It was since the war that I met General Sherman, and it was on the line of  the Union Pacific Railway, at one of those justly celebrated  eating-houses, which I understand are now abandoned. The colored waiter  had cut off a strip of the omelette with a pair of shears, the scorched  oatmeal had been passed around, the little rubber door mats fried in  butter and called pancakes had been dealt around the table, and the  cashier at the end of the hall had just gone through the clothes of a  party from Vermont, who claimed a rebate on the ground that the waiter had  refused to bring him anything but his bill. There was no sound in the  dining-room except the weak request of the coffee for more air and  stimulants, or perhaps the cry of pain when the butter, while practicing  with the dumb-bells, would hit a child on the head; then all would be  still again.    General Sherman sat at one end of the table, throwing a life-preserver to  a fly in the milk pitcher.    We had never met before, though for years we had been plodding along  life's rugged way--he in the war department, I in the postoffice  department. Unknown to each other, we had been holding up opposite corners  of the great national fabric, if you will allow me that expression.    I remember, as well as though it were but yesterday, how the conversation  began. General Sherman looked sternly at me and said:    \"I wish you would overpower that butter and send it up this way.\"    \"All right,\" said I, \"if you will please pass those molasses.\"    That was all that was said, but I shall never forget it, and probably he  never will. The conversation was brief, but yet how full of food for  thought! How true, how earnest, how natural! Nothing stilted or false  about it. It was the natural expression of two minds that were too great  to be verbose or to monkey with social, conversational flapdoodle.    [Illustration: AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE BUTTER.]    I remember, once, a great while ago, I was asked by a friend to go with  him in the evening to the house of an acquaintance, where they were going  to have a kind of musicale, at which there was to be some noted pianist,  who had kindly consented to play a few strains, I did not get the name of  the professional, but I went, and when the first piece was announced I saw  that the light was very uncertain, so I kindly volunteered to get a lamp  from another room. I held that big lamp, weighing about twenty-nine  pounds, for half an hour, while the pianist would tinky tinky up on the  right hand, or bang, boomy to bang down on the bass, while he snorted and  slugged that old concert grand piano and almost knocked its teeth down its  throat, or gently dawdled with the keys like a pale moonbeam shimmering  through the bleached rafters of a deceased horse, until at last there was  a wild jangle, such as the accomplished musician gives to an instrument to  show the audience that he has disabled the piano, and will take a slight  intermission while it is sent to the junk shop.    With a sigh of relief I carefully put down the twenty-nine pound lamp, and  my friend told me that I had been standing there like liberty enlightening  the world, and holding that heavy lamp for Blind Tom.      I had never seen him before, and I slipped out of the room before he had a  chance to see me.          Concerning Coroners.    I am glad to notice that in the East there is a growing disfavor in the  public mind for selecting a practicing physician for the office of  coroner. This matter should have attracted attention years ago. Now it  gratifies me to notice a finer feeling on the part of the people, and an  awakening of those sensibilities which go to make life more highly prized  and far more enjoyable.    I had the misfortune at one time to be under the medical charge of a  coroner who had graduated from a Chicago morgue and practiced medicine  along with his inquest business with the most fiendish delight. I do not  know which he enjoyed best, holding the inquest or practicing on his  patient and getting the victim ready for the quest.    One day he wrote out a prescription and left it for me to have filled. I  was surprised to find that he had made a mistake and left a rough draft of  the verdict in my own case and a list of jurors which he had made in  memorandum, so as to be ready for the worst. I was alarmed, for I did not  know that I was in so dangerous a condition. He had the advantage of me,  for he knew just what he was giving me, and how long human life could be  sustained under his treatment. I did not.    That is why I say that the profession of medicine should not be allowed to  conflict with the solemn duties of the coroner. They are constantly  clashing and infringing upon each other's territory. This coroner had a  kind of tread-softly-bow-the-head way of getting around the room that made  my flesh creep. He had a way, too, when I was asleep, of glancing  hurriedly through the pockets of my pantaloons as they hung over a chair,  probably to see what evidence he could find that might aid the jury in  arriving at a verdict. Once I woke up and found him examining a draft that  he had found in my pocket. I asked him what he was doing with my funds,  and he said that he thought he detected a draft in the room and he had  just found out where it came from.    After that I hoped that death would come to my relief as speedily as  possible. I felt that death would be a happy release from the cold touch  of the amateur coroner and pro tem physician. I could look forward with  pleasure, and even joy, to the moment when my physician would come for the  last time in his professional capacity and go to work on me officially.  Then the county would be obliged to pay him, and the undertaker could take  charge of the fragments left by the inquest.    The duties of the physician are with the living, those of the coroner with  the dead. No effort, therefore, should be made to unite them. It is in  violation of all the finer feelings of humanity. When the physician  decides that his tendencies point mostly toward immortality and the names  of his patients are nearly all found on the moss-covered stones of the  cemetery, he may abandon the profession with safety and take hold of  politics. Then, should his tastes lead him to the inquest, let him  gravitate toward the office of coroner; but the two should not be united.    No man ought to follow his fellow down the mysterious river that defines  the boundary between the known and the unknown, and charge him  professionally till his soul has fled, and then charge a per diem to the  county for prying into his internal economy and holding an inquest over  the debris of mortality. I therefore hail this movement with joy and wish  to encourage it in every way. It points toward a degree of enlightenment  which will be in strong contrast with the darker and more ignorant epochs  of time, when the practice of medicine was united with the profession of  the barber, the well-digger, the farrier, the veterinarian or the coroner.    Why, this physician plenipotentiary and coroner extraordinary that I have  referred to, didn't know when he got a call whether to take his morphine  syringe or his venire for a jury. He very frequently went to see a patient  with a lung tester under one arm and the revised statutes under the other.  People never knew when they saw him going to a neighbor's house, whether  the case had yielded to the coroner's treatment or not. No one ever knew  just when over-taxed nature would yield to the statutes in such case made  and provided.    When the jury was impanelled, however, we always knew that the medical  treatment had been successfully fatal.    Once he charged the county with an inquest he felt sure of, but in the  night the patient got delirious, eluded his nurse, the physician and  coroner, and fled to the foot-hills, where he was taken care of and  finally recovered.
