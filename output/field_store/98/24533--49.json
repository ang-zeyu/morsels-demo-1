We will not  here risk the solution of these problems, but will satisfy  ourselves in fixing attention on the striking contrast in the  configuration of the land in the eastern and western extremities of  Europe. Between the Baltic and the Black Sea, the ground is at  present scarcely fifty toises above the level of the ocean, while  the plain of La Mancha, if placed between the sources of the Niemen  and the Borysthenes, would figure as a group of mountains of  considerable height. If the causes, which may have changed the  surface of our planet, be an interesting speculation,  investigations of the phenomena, such as they offer themselves to  the measures and observations of the naturalist, lead to far  greater certainty.    From Astorga to Corunna, especially from Lugo, the mountains rise  gradually. The secondary formations gently disappear, and are  succeeded by the transition rocks, which indicate the proximity of  primitive strata. We found considerable mountains composed of that  ancient grey stone which the mineralogists of the school of  Freyberg name grauwakke, and grauwakkenschiefer. I do not know  whether this formation, which is not frequent in the south of  Europe, has hitherto been discovered in other parts of Spain.  Angular fragments of Lydian stone, scattered along the valleys,  seemed to indicate that the transition schist is the basis of the  strata of greywacke. Near Corunna even granitic ridges stretch as  far as Cape Ortegal. These granites, which seem formerly to have  been contiguous to those of Britanny and Cornwall, are perhaps the  wrecks of a chain of mountains destroyed and sunk in the waves.  Large and beautiful crystals of feldspar characterise this rock.  Common tin ore is sometimes discovered there, but working the mines  is a laborious and unprofitable operation for the inhabitants of  Galicia.    The first secretary of state had recommended us very particularly  to brigadier Don Raphael Clavijo, who was employed in forming new  dock-yards at Corunna. He advised us to embark on board the sloop  Pizarro,* (* According to the Spanish nomenclature, the Pizarro was  a light frigate (fragata lijera).) which was to sail in company  with the Alcudia, the packet-boat of the month of May, which, on  account of the blockade, had been detained three weeks in the port.  Senor Clavijo ordered the necessary arrangements to be made on  board the sloop for placing our instruments, and the captain of the  Pizarro received orders to stop at Teneriffe, as long as we should  judge necessary to enable us to visit the port of Orotava, and  ascend the peak.    We had yet ten days to wait before we embarked. During this  interval, we employed ourselves in preparing the plants we had  collected in the beautiful valleys of Galicia, which no naturalist  had yet visited: we examined the fuci and the mollusca which the  north-west winds had cast with great profusion at the foot of the  steep rock, on which the lighthouse of the Tower of Hercules is  built. This edifice, called also the Iron Tower, was repaired in  1788. It is ninety-two feet high, its walls are four feet and a  half thick, and its construction clearly proves that it was built  by the Romans. An inscription discovered near its foundation, a  copy of which M. Laborde obligingly gave me, informs us, that this  pharos was constructed by Caius Sevius Lupus, architect of the city  of Aqua Flavia (Chaves), and that it was dedicated to Mars. Why is  the Iron Tower called in the country by the name of Hercules? Was  it built by the Romans on the ruins of a Greek or Phoenician  edifice? Strabo, indeed, affirms that Galicia, the country of the  Callaeci, had been peopled by Greek colonies. According to an  extract from the geography of Spain, by Asclepiades the Myrlaean,  an ancient tradition stated that the companions of Hercules had  settled in these countries.    The ports of Ferrol and Corunna both communicate with one bay, so  that a vessel driven by bad weather towards the coast may anchor in  either, according to the wind. This advantage is invaluable where  the sea is almost always tempestuous, as between capes Ortegal and  Finisterre, which are the promontories Trileucum and Artabrum of  ancient geography. A narrow passage, flanked by perpendicular rocks  of granite, leads to the extensive basin of Ferrol. No port in  Europe has so extraordinary an anchorage, from its very inland  position. The narrow and tortuous passage by which vessels enter  this port, has been opened, either by the irruption of the waves,  or by the reiterated shocks of very violent earthquakes. In the New  World, on the coasts of New Andalusia, the Laguna del Obispo  (Bishop's lake) is formed exactly like the port of Ferrol. The most  curious geological phenomena are often repeated at immense  distances on the surface of continents; and naturalists who have  examined different parts of the globe, are struck with the extreme  resemblance observed in the rents on coasts, in the sinuosities of  the valleys, in the aspect of the mountains, and in their  distribution by groups. The accidental concurrence of the same  causes must have everywhere produced the same effects; and amidst  the variety of nature, an analogy of structure and form is observed  in the arrangement of inanimate matter, as well as in the internal  organization of plants and of animals.    Crossing from Corunna to Ferrol, over a shallow, near the White  Signal, in the bay, which according to D'Anville is the Portus  Magnus of the ancients, we made several experiments by means of a  valved thermometrical sounding lead, on the temperature of the  ocean, and on the decrement of caloric in the successive strata of  water. The thermometer on the bank, and near the surface, was from  12.5 to 13.3 degrees centigrades, while in deep water it constantly  marked 15 or 15.3 degrees, the air being at 12.8 degrees. The  celebrated Franklin and Mr. Jonathan Williams* (* Author of a work  entitled \"Thermometrical Navigation,\" published at Philadelphia.)  were the first to invite the attention of naturalists to the  phenomena of the temperature of the Atlantic over shoals, and in  that zone of tepid and flowing waters which runs from the gulf of  Mexico to the banks of Newfoundland and the northern coasts of  Europe. The observation, that the proximity of a sand-bank is  indicated by a rapid descent of the temperature of the sea at its  surface, is not only interesting to the naturalist, but may become  also very important for the safety of navigators. The use of the  thermometer ought certainly not to lead us to neglect the use of  the lead; but experiments sufficiently prove, that variations of  temperature, sensible to the most imperfect instruments, indicate  danger long before the vessel reaches the shoals. In such cases,  the frigidity of the water may induce the pilot to heave the lead  in places where he thought himself in the most perfect safety. The  waters which cover the shoals owe in a great measure the diminution  of their temperature to their mixture with the lower strata of  water, which rise towards the surface on the edge of the banks.    The moment of leaving Europe for the first time is attended with a  solemn feeling. We in vain summon to our minds the frequency of the  communication between the two worlds; we in vain reflect on the  great facility with which, from the improved state of navigation,  we traverse the Atlantic, which compared to the Pacific is but a  larger arm of the sea; the sentiment we feel when we first  undertake so distant a voyage is not the less accompanied by a deep  emotion, unlike any other impression we have hitherto felt.  Separated from the objects of our dearest affections, entering in  some sort on a new state of existence, we are forced to fall back  on our own thoughts, and we feel within ourselves a dreariness we  have never known before. Among the letters which, at the time of  our embarking, I wrote to friends in France and Germany, one had a  considerable influence on the direction of our travels, and on our  succeeding operations. When I left Paris with the intention of  visiting the coast of Africa, the expedition for discoveries in the  Pacific seemed to be adjourned for several years. I had agreed with  captain Baudin, that if, contrary to his expectation, his voyage  took place at an earlier period, and intelligence of it should  reach me in time, I would endeavour to return from Algiers to a  port in France or Spain, to join the expedition. I renewed this  promise on leaving Europe, and wrote to M. Baudin, that if the  government persisted in sending him by Cape Horn, I would endeavour  to meet him either at Monte Video, Chile, or Lima, or wherever he  should touch in the Spanish colonies. In consequence of this  engagement, I changed the plan of my journey, on reading in the  American papers, in 1801, that the French expedition had sailed  from Havre, to circumnavigate the globe from east to west. I hired  a small vessel from Batabano, in the island of Cuba, to Portobello,  and thence crossed the isthmus to the coast of the Pacific; this  mistake of a journalist led M. Bonpland and myself to travel eight  hundred leagues through a country we had no intention to visit. It  was only at Quito, that a letter from M. Delambre, perpetual  secretary of the first class of the Institute, informed us, that  captain Baudin went by the Cape of Good Hope, without touching on  the eastern or western coasts of America.    We spent two days at Corunna, after our instruments were embarked.  A thick fog, which covered the horizon, at length indicated the  change of weather we so anxiously desired. On the 4th of June, in  the evening, the wind turned to north-east, a point which, on the  coast of Galicia, is considered very constant during the summer.  The Pizarro prepared to sail on the 5th, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6329"],[0,"Catalogue of British Columbia Birds (#8)"],[1,"Streator, August 7th, 1889.
