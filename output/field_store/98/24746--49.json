IMPARTIALITE D'UN SOUVERAIN    Gustave III, roi de Suede, etait un despote eclaire et aimait  a faire justice de tout le monde, sans partialite. Un de ses  courtisans lui dit un jour: \"Je suis averti que tel forme des  projets contre les jours de votre Majeste.\" Mais le roi ne se  laissait pas tromper si facilement. \"Je suis averti, repond ce  grand homme, que tel est votre ennemi. Allez vous reconcilier  ensemble, et j'ecouterai ensuite tout ce que vous viendrez me  dire de lui.\" Il est a regretter que les souverains de la trempe  de Gustave soient[1] si peu nombreux.

Le maitre, qui allait en ville  pour affaires, ordonna a un de ses gens d'avoir l'oeil sur le  domestique pendant son absence, et de l'empecher, dans le cas  ou il voudrait recidiver. Le malheureux ne pouvant se noyer,  prit le parti de se pendre. Le maitre, de retour, surpris de ce  que l'autre ne l'en avait pas empeche, lui en fit de violents  reproches. Celui-ci lui repondit: \"Ma foi, monsieur, j'ai cru  qu'il s'etait mis la pour se secher.\"      Qui voulait se suicider?--Qui est-ce qui l'en empechait?--Quelle  precaution le maitre a-t-il prise contre une nouvelle tentative?--Et  avec quel succes?      50. LE DOMESTIQUE DE L'INVALIDE    Un vieux soldat de l'empire avait laisse sur le champ de bataille  ses quatre membres _principaux_, et avait du les remplacer, tant  _bien_ que _mal_, _artificiellement_. Le tourneur de son village  s'etait charge de la chose; car l'art d'articuler un membre  _artificiel_ n'etait pas arrive a la hauteur qu'il a atteinte  de nos jours. Chaque soir, le vieil invalide se debarrassait  de ses membres _inutiles_ pour se mettre au lit.    Un jour, il changea de domestique. Le _nouveau_ garcon qui le  soignait ne connaissait pas routes les infirmites dont son maitre  etait afflige.    Le soir venu: \"Tiens, lui dit-il en lui tendant le bras, tire-moi  ce bras.\" Et le bras resta entre les mains du garcon: c'etait  un bras de bois. Mais jugez de son etonnement quand l'invalide,  presentant tous ses membres l'un apres l'autre, ne cessait de  lui dire: \"Tire-moi cette jambe; tire-moi l'autre.\" Le _pauvre_  garcon se mit a trembler de se trouver en face d'un homme de bois,  qui n'avait que le tronc, et qui semblait pose sur la chaise,  devant lui, comme un de ces antiques dieux de pierre, dont le  temps avait mutile les membres.    Mais ce n'est pas tout; le vieux soldat, voulant se rejouir jusqu'au  bout de la frayeur qu'eprouvait le garcon, tendit le cou en lui  disant: \"Maintenant, tire-moi la tete.\"    Pour le coup, le _malheureux_ domestique, epouvante, se mit a  pousser un cri de terreur, et s'enfuit a toutes jambes.      Ou le soldat avait-il laisse ses quatre membres?--Les a-t-il  remplaces?--Qui s'est charge de la chose?--Le soldat se  debarrassait-il quelquefois de ses membres artificiels?--Qui lui  servait de valet?--Savait-il les infirmites de son maitre?--Racontez  l'incident qui a eu lieu quand le soldat se disposait a se coucher.

When Dan's team finally rounded the pole, and was headed toward him,  George realized that the work of Mego's sons evinced not only mechanical  precision, but the intelligence of their breeding, and the advantages of  their early training by \"Scotty.\" Dan would indeed, as he had boasted,  \"give them a run for their money.\"    \"_Mush_, Spot, Queen, Baldy,\" and there was a slight increase in  briskness, which was checked again as they swung by the guard.    \"Now then, Spot,\" and George gave a peculiar shrill whistle that to the  dog meant \"Full Speed Ahead.\"    He watched the distance between himself and Dan decrease slowly at  first; then more rapidly until they were abreast of one another. True to  their compact they did not speak, and the inclination of Spot to stop  for the usual visit beside his stable mates received no encouragement.  Instead he got a stern command to \"Hike, and hike _quick_!\"    Beyond were the other teams, almost together, and to George it seemed as  if he barely crept toward Bob and Bill; though there was a steady gain  to the point where he could call out for the right of way to pass--a  privilege the driver of the faster team can demand.    But just behind him came Dan, whose dogs now felt the inspiration of the  stiff gait set them by their friends; and both boys knew that from now  on the race was between them alone.    George was more experienced in handling dogs, but Dan's dogs were easier  to handle. It was narrowing down to a question of the skill of the  driver on one side, pitted against the excellence of the dogs on the  other. Unless, indeed, Spot, Queen or Baldy should rise to the occasion  in some unexpected manner; or the Luck of the Trail, that the Woman  believed was so potent a factor, should enter into the contest.    They were approaching the last quarter of the course, where the road  from Monroeville crossed the trail diagonally. George glanced back and  saw that he would have to travel faster still to shake off Dan's  tireless \"Pupmobile.\"    For a moment he wondered despairingly why he had been so short-sighted  as to choose three unknown quantities in such an important event,  leaving to Dan those whose worth was a foregone conclusion. Then his  sporting blood rose. If no one ever attempted anything new, it would be  a pretty slow old world. And if he had not the courage to try Spot out,  his pet might remain an ordinary, commonplace dog to the end of his  days; a condition that would be intolerable to George. Then, too, it  would have been a disappointment to Ben if Baldy could not have entered;  and Ben's feelings were now of much consequence to George and Danny, as  they had admitted him, a third member, to their exclusive secret  society, \"The Ancient and Honorable Order of Bow-Wow Wonder Workers.\"  Better defeat than a fair chance not taken; and so, at such thoughts he  was cheered and again whistled to Spot to \"Speed Up.\"    But just at that instant there came, down the Monroeville Road, and  around the base of a small rise of ground, a Native hunter over whose  shoulder was hung a dozen or more ptarmigan, the grouse of the North.  Spot paused instantly, and seemed petrified in an attitude which his  distant grandsires, old in field work, might have envied for its perfect  immobility. The fact that the birds were dead and on a string meant  nothing to his untutored mind. They were birds, and as such were worthy  of a close and careful inspection.    Simultaneously Queen's hatred of Eskimos received an impetus; and joined  by the now aroused Spot, she started off the trail toward the  unconscious cause of her deep-seated antipathy.    \"A double-ender,\" groaned George; \"dead birds, and an Eskimo. Spot and  Queen won't show up till everything's over but the shoutin'. I'll just  about tie for fourth place if Jim gets his pups away from the pigs  about the time Queen finishes with the hunter.\"    But tug as desperately as they might, neither Spot nor Queen succeeded  in pulling the sled more than a few feet; for added to George's weight  on the brake, Baldy, calm and immovable, was braced against the efforts  of the other two.    Spot's ungainly feet pawed the snow impatiently, as he strained in his  collar stretching the tow-line so taut that George feared it might snap.  Equally unavailing were Queen's sudden leaps and frantic plunges. The  more they struggled, the more firmly Baldy held to the trail.    At last George's stern reproofs, and a certain reasonableness in Spot  that prompted him to accept the inevitable gracefully, combined to end  the disturbance. Besides, the birds did not run nor fly, so they were  not much fun anyway.    Not for Queen, however, was any such placid acceptance of defeat. Balked  of her expected prey, she turned fiercely against her wheel-mate, whom  she rightly considered responsible for her inability to bolt; and after  one or two efforts, she fastened her teeth in his ear, leaving a small  wound from which the blood trickled, staining his collar and shoulder.  George expected Baldy to retaliate, but instead the dog ignored the  attack and still held his ground with a determination that even Queen  recognized, and to which she finally submitted unwillingly.    But in the time it took to adjust their difficulties, Dan caught up with  them, and together the two teams dashed down the trail, neck and neck.    Dan longed to shout some facetious criticisms of the behavior he had  just witnessed, but a certain sympathy for his rival, who was also his  friend, restrained him; as well as the desire to conserve every atom of  energy he possessed, even to saving his breath.    For a few hundred yards there was no perceptible difference in their  positions; then gradually the Mego Pups pulled away and took the lead by  a small margin.    Nose to the back of Dan's sled came Spot, and so they sped on and on  till the bridge and high bank of Dry Creek came into view, as well as  the moving dark objects that the boys knew to be the crowds awaiting  their return.    George, desperately anxious to try the signal that would urge his  leader to his utmost, waited till they reached the top of a slight  incline. Then the whistle sounded low, but clear. Spot leaped forward,  and Queen and Baldy were no laggards in his wake.    Once more they were abreast of the \"houn' dogs,\" and once more the tried  and untried of the same Kennel raced side by side, with even chances of  victory.    Then again came the Luck of the Trail; and Fate that had sent dead birds  as a temptation now sent a live cat as an inspiration. It was black and  sleek and swift, and fairly flew from a clump of willows by the wayside,  up the trail toward a cabin on the edge of town; and after it flew Spot,  all eagerness for the chase.    Dan's team, as indifferent to the fascination of swift, sleek cats as  only dogs of \"Scotty's\" training could be, were pursuing the even tenor  of their way in no wise excited by the episode.    When the cat darted out of sight to safety George's dogs were almost at  the starting point and the crowds had hurried to meet them; keeping free  only a narrow passage down which they dashed with unabated speed. For  while they were tired, and home and rest were near, the cheers and  applause of the people egged them on till they crossed the line, where  George was greeted as Winner of the First Annual, Juvenile Race of Nome.    He had covered the course of seven miles in thirty minutes and six  seconds, while two minutes behind came Dan, just in time to offer loyal  homage on the altar of friendship and success. There was a warm clasp of  the hand, and a sincere if brief tribute. \"You are some swell racer,  George,\" and, as one making a vow, \"you can bet I'll never throw rocks  at another black cat so long as I live.\"    Shortly Bob and Bill arrived, well pleased that they were so close to  the Victor--but there was no sign of Jim; whereupon Mr. Kelly delivered  himself of a scathing comment. \"I guess next time Jim 'd better enter  the High School Girls' Handicap; these real races ain't any place for  him.\"    The presentation of the tiny Trophy Cup was a formal function. George,  held up in the Judge's arms that he might be seen as he received it, was  filled not only with present pride, but also with an inward  determination to devote the rest of his existence to the high calling of  dog racing; with perhaps an occasional descent into the lower realms of  school affairs and business, as a concession to the wishes of his  parents and in deference to their age and old-fashioned ideas.    His happiness in the accomplishment of his dogs was complete. His hard  work in their training had been fully repaid; for Spot had not only  proved his cleverness as a leader, but Queen had been no worse than he  had anticipated, and Baldy had faithfully performed his duty as a  wheeler in keeping the trail when it was most necessary.    It was a triumph worth while for the boy and the team.    That night at a full meeting of the \"Bow-Wow Wonder Workers,\" the  exciting affairs of the day were discussed at length.    Dan announced that he could recommend the Mego Pups to \"Scotty\" without  a single unfavorable criticism. If there had been any weakness, it was,  he admitted freely, in his driving. \"I don't seem to put the ginger into  'em the way George does at the finish. But I guess he takes it from his  father; and my dad,\" regretfully, \"never drove anything better 'n horses  in his whole life. Then there was that black cat, too.\"    Ben Edwards, with his arm around Baldy's neck, listened with delight as  the minute details of the race were given by those who knew whereof they  spoke. He was proud indeed when George told how Baldy had steadfastly  held out"]]]
