I see it now!\" I shrieked. \"You have seized the throne and the  empire. Woe! woe to you who are crowned with the crown of the King in  Yellow!\"      [EDITOR'S NOTE.--Mr. Castaigne died yesterday in the Asylum for Criminal  Insane.]          THE MASK    CAMILLA: You, sir, should unmask.    STRANGER: Indeed?    CASSILDA: Indeed it's time. We all have laid aside disguise but you.    STRANGER: I wear no mask.    CAMILLA: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!    _The King in Yellow, Act I, Scene 2_.      I    Although I knew nothing of chemistry, I listened fascinated. He picked up  an Easter lily which Genevieve had brought that morning from Notre Dame,  and dropped it into the basin. Instantly the liquid lost its crystalline  clearness. For a second the lily was enveloped in a milk-white foam,  which disappeared, leaving the fluid opalescent. Changing tints of orange  and crimson played over the surface, and then what seemed to be a ray of  pure sunlight struck through from the bottom where the lily was resting.  At the same instant he plunged his hand into the basin and drew out the  flower. \"There is no danger,\" he explained, \"if you choose the right  moment. That golden ray is the signal.\"    He held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to  stone, to the purest marble.    \"You see,\" he said, \"it is without a flaw. What sculptor could reproduce  it?\"    The marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily  were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its  heart.    \"Don't ask me the reason of that,\" he smiled, noticing my wonder. \"I have  no idea why the veins and heart are tinted, but they always are.  Yesterday I tried one of Genevieve's gold-fish,--there it is.\"    The fish looked as if sculptured in marble. But if you held it to the  light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from  somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an  opal. I looked into the basin. Once more it seemed filled with clearest  crystal.    \"If I should touch it now?\" I demanded.    \"I don't know,\" he replied, \"but you had better not try.\"    \"There is one thing I'm curious about,\" I said, \"and that is where the  ray of sunlight came from.\"    \"It looked like a sunbeam true enough,\" he said. \"I don't know, it always  comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps,\" he continued, smiling,  \"perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source  from whence it came.\"    I saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only  laughed and changed the subject.    \"Stay to lunch. Genevieve will be here directly.\"    \"I saw her going to early mass,\" I said, \"and she looked as fresh and  sweet as that lily--before you destroyed it.\"    \"Do you think I destroyed it?\" said Boris gravely.    \"Destroyed, preserved, how can we tell?\"    We sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinished group of the  \"Fates.\" He leaned back on the sofa, twirling a sculptor's chisel and  squinting at his work.    \"By the way,\" he said, \"I have finished pointing up that old academic  Ariadne, and I suppose it will have to go to the Salon. It's all I have  ready this year, but after the success the 'Madonna' brought me I feel  ashamed to send a thing like that.\"    The \"Madonna,\" an exquisite marble for which Genevieve had sat, had been  the sensation of last year's Salon. I looked at the Ariadne. It was a  magnificent piece of technical work, but I agreed with Boris that the  world would expect something better of him than that. Still, it was  impossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that splendid  terrible group half shrouded in the marble behind me. The \"Fates\" would  have to wait.    We were proud of Boris Yvain. We claimed him and he claimed us on the  strength of his having been born in America, although his father was  French and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called  him Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the  same familiar way--Jack Scott and myself.    Perhaps my being in love with Genevieve had something to do with his  affection for me. Not that it had ever been acknowledged between us. But  after all was settled, and she had told me with tears in her eyes that it  was Boris whom she loved, I went over to his house and congratulated him.  The perfect cordiality of that interview did not deceive either of us, I  always believed, although to one at least it was a great comfort. I do  not think he and Genevieve ever spoke of the matter together, but Boris  knew.    Genevieve was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have been  inspired by the Sanctus in Gounod's Mass. But I was always glad when she  changed that mood for what we called her \"April Manoeuvres.\" She was  often as variable as an April day. In the morning grave, dignified and  sweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever one least  expected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like  tranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of  Genevieve when he spoke again.    \"What do you think of my discovery, Alec?\"    \"I think it wonderful.\"    \"I shall make no use of it, you know, beyond satisfying my own curiosity  so far as may be, and the secret will die with me.\"    \"It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not? We painters lose  more than we ever gain by photography.\"    Boris nodded, playing with the edge of the chisel.    \"This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall  never confide the secret to any one,\" he said slowly.    It would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena than  myself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated with  silica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned to  stone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the silica  replaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result was a  duplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never interested  me greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced, they disgusted  me. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of repugnance, had  investigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled on a solution  which, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity unheard of, in a  second did the work of years. This was all I could make out of the  strange story he had just been telling me. He spoke again after a long  silence.    \"I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists would  go mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered itself.  When I think of that formula, and that new element precipitated in  metallic scales--\"    \"What new element?\"    \"Oh, I haven't thought of naming it, and I don't believe I ever shall.  There are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over.\"    I pricked up my ears. \"Have you struck gold, Boris?\"    \"No, better;--but see here, Alec!\" he laughed, starting up. \"You and I  have all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look  already!\" I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for  gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevieve came in  shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.    Genevieve was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light  glinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek to  Boris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never before  failed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers, and I  promptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her hand,  which dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said, looking  at Boris--    \"You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon.\" This also was something new.  She had always asked me herself until to-day.    \"I did,\" said Boris shortly.    \"And you said yes, I hope?\" She turned to me with a charming conventional  smile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday. I  made her a low bow. \"J'avais bien l'honneur, madame,\" but refusing to  take up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable commonplace  and disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.    \"I had better go home, don't you think?\" I asked.    \"Hanged if I know,\" he replied frankly.    While we were discussing the advisability of my departure Genevieve  reappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully  beautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too  bright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.    \"Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but I  haven't. Come here, Boris;\" and she slipped her other arm through his.  \"Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I like as  well as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won't hurt him.\"    \"A la bonheur!\" I cried, \"who says there are no thunderstorms in April?\"    \"Are you ready?\" chanted Boris. \"Aye ready;\" and arm-in-arm we raced into  the dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much  to blame; Genevieve was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite  twenty-one.          II    Some work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for  Genevieve's boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in the  Rue Sainte-Cecile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as we  pleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott, idled a  great deal together.    One quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining  curios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars from  strange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room. Boris,  all over clay, stood there washing his hands.    The room was built"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/85"],[0,"The Beasts of Tarzan (#8)"],[1,"into sight, Tarzan dropped to the earth  beside the struggling and infuriated Numa, and with a long sharp knife  sprang upon him at one side even as Sheeta did upon the other.    The panther tore and rent Numa upon the right, while the ape-man struck  home with his stone knife upon the other, so that before the mighty  clawing of the king of beasts had succeeded in parting the rope he hung  quite dead and harmless in the noose.    And then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage  throats the victory cry of the bull-ape and the panther, blended into  one frightful and uncanny scream.    As the last notes died away in a long-drawn, fearsome wail, a score of  painted warriors, drawing their long war-canoe upon the beach, halted  to stare in the direction of the jungle and to listen.          Chapter 5    Mugambi      By the time that Tarzan had travelled entirely about the coast of the  island, and made several trips inland from various points, he was sure  that he was the only human being upon it.    Nowhere had he found any sign that men had stopped even temporarily  upon this shore, though, of course, he knew that so quickly does the  rank vegetation of the tropics erase all but the most permanent of  human monuments that he might be in error in his deductions.    The day following the killing of Numa, Tarzan and Sheeta came upon the  tribe of Akut.  At sight of the panther the great apes took to flight,  but after a time Tarzan succeeded in recalling them.    It had occurred to him that it would be at least an interesting  experiment to attempt to reconcile these hereditary enemies.  He  welcomed anything that would occupy his time and his mind beyond the  filling of his belly and the gloomy thoughts to which he fell prey the  moment that he became idle.    To communicate his plan to the apes was not a particularly difficult  matter, though their narrow and limited vocabulary was strained in the  effort; but to impress upon the little, wicked brain of Sheeta that he  was to hunt with and not for his legitimate prey proved a task almost  beyond the powers of the ape-man.    Tarzan, among his other weapons, possessed a long, stout cudgel, and  after fastening his rope about the panther's neck he used this  instrument freely upon the snarling beast, endeavouring in this way to  impress upon its memory that it must not attack the great, shaggy  manlike creatures that had approached more closely once they had seen  the purpose of the rope about Sheeta's neck.    That the cat did not turn and rend Tarzan is something of a miracle  which may possibly be accounted for by the fact that twice when it  turned growling upon the ape-man he had rapped it sharply upon its  sensitive nose, inculcating in its mind thereby a most wholesome fear  of the cudgel and the ape-beasts behind it.    It is a question if the original cause of his attachment for Tarzan was  still at all clear in the mind of the panther, though doubtless some  subconscious suggestion, superinduced by this primary reason and aided  and abetted by the habit of the past few days, did much to compel the  beast to tolerate treatment at his hands that would have sent it at the  throat of any other creature.    Then, too, there was the compelling force of the manmind exerting its  powerful influence over this creature of a lower order, and, after all,  it may have been this that proved the most potent factor in Tarzan's  supremacy over Sheeta and the other beasts of the jungle that had from  time to time fallen under his domination.    Be that as it may, for days the man, the panther, and the great apes  roamed their savage haunts side by side, making their kills together  and sharing them with one another, and of all the fierce and savage  band none was more terrible than the smooth-skinned, powerful beast  that had been but a few short months before a familiar figure in many a  London drawing room.    Sometimes the beasts separated to follow their own inclinations for an  hour or a day, and it was upon one of these occasions when the ape-man  had wandered through the tree-tops toward the beach, and was stretched  in the hot sun upon the sand, that from the low summit of a near-by  promontory a pair of keen eyes discovered him.    For a moment the owner of the eyes looked in astonishment at the figure  of the savage white man basking in the rays of that hot, tropic sun;  then he turned, making a sign to some one behind him.  Presently  another pair of eyes were looking down upon the ape-man, and then  another and another, until a full score of hideously trapped, savage  warriors were lying upon their bellies along the crest of the ridge  watching the white-skinned stranger.    They were down wind from Tarzan, and so their scent was not carried to  him, and as his back was turned half toward them he did not see their  cautious advance over the edge of the promontory and down through the  rank grass toward the sandy beach where he lay.    Big fellows they were, all of them, their barbaric headdresses and  grotesquely painted faces, together with their many metal ornaments and  gorgeously coloured feathers, adding to their wild, fierce appearance.    Once at the foot of the ridge, they came cautiously to their feet, and,  bent half-double, advanced silently upon the unconscious white man,  their heavy war-clubs swinging menacingly in their brawny hands.    The mental suffering that Tarzan's sorrowful thoughts induced had the  effect of numbing his keen, perceptive faculties, so that the advancing  savages were almost upon him before he became aware that he was no  longer alone upon the beach.    So quickly, though, were his mind and muscles wont to react in unison  to the slightest alarm that he was upon his feet and facing his  enemies, even as he realized that something was behind him.  As he  sprang to his feet the warriors leaped toward him with raised clubs and  savage yells, but the foremost went down to sudden death beneath the  long, stout stick of the ape-man, and then the lithe, sinewy figure was  among them, striking right and left with a fury, power, and precision  that brought panic to the ranks of the blacks.    For a moment they withdrew, those that were left of them, and consulted  together at a short distance from the ape-man, who stood with folded  arms, a half-smile upon his handsome face, watching them.  Presently  they advanced upon him once more, this time wielding their heavy  war-spears.  They were between Tarzan and the jungle, in a little  semicircle that closed in upon him as they advanced.    There seemed to the ape-man but slight chance to escape the final  charge when all the great spears should be hurled simultaneously at  him; but if he had desired to escape there was no way other than  through the ranks of the savages except the open sea behind him.    His predicament was indeed most serious when an idea occurred to him  that altered his smile to a broad grin.   The warriors were still some  little distance away, advancing slowly, making, after the manner of  their kind, a frightful din with their savage yells and the pounding of  their naked feet upon the ground as they leaped up and down in a  fantastic war dance.    Then it was that the ape-man lifted his voice in a series of wild,  weird screams that brought the blacks to a sudden, perplexed halt.  They looked at one another questioningly, for here was a sound so  hideous that their own frightful din faded into insignificance beside  it.  No human throat could have formed those bestial notes, they were  sure, and yet with their own eyes they had seen this white man open his  mouth to pour forth his awful cry.    But only for a moment they hesitated, and then with one accord they  again took up their fantastic advance upon their prey; but even then a  sudden crashing in the jungle behind them brought them once more to a  halt, and as they turned to look in the direction of this new noise  there broke upon their startled visions a sight that may well have  frozen the blood of braver men than the Wagambi.    Leaping from the tangled vegetation of the jungle's rim came a huge  panther, with blazing eyes and bared fangs, and in his wake a score of  mighty, shaggy apes lumbering rapidly toward them, half erect upon  their short, bowed legs, and with their long arms reaching to the  ground, where their horny knuckles bore the weight of their ponderous  bodies as they lurched from side to side in their grotesque advance.    The beasts of Tarzan had come in answer to his call.    Before the Wagambi could recover from their astonishment the frightful  horde was upon them from one side and Tarzan of the Apes from the  other.  Heavy spears were hurled and mighty war-clubs wielded, and  though apes went down never to rise, so, too, went down the men of  Ugambi.    Sheeta's cruel fangs and tearing talons ripped and tore at the black  hides.  Akut's mighty yellow tusks found the jugular of more than one  sleek-skinned savage, and Tarzan of the Apes was here and there and  everywhere, urging on his fierce allies and taking a heavy toll with  his long, slim knife.    In a moment the blacks had scattered for their lives, but of the score  that had crept down the grassy sides of the promontory only a single  warrior managed to escape the horde that had overwhelmed his people.    This one was Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi, and as he  disappeared in the tangled luxuriousness of the rank growth upon the  ridge's summit only the keen eyes of the ape-man saw the direction of  his flight.    Leaving his pack to eat their fill upon the flesh of their  victims--flesh that he could not touch--Tarzan of the Apes pursued the  single survivor of the bloody fray.  Just beyond the ridge he came  within sight of the fleeing black, making with headlong leaps for a  long war-canoe that was drawn well up upon the beach above the high  tide surf.
