[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10166"],[0,"What Germany Thinks; Or, The War as Germans see it (#9)"],[1,"thief to  catch a thief,\" I shall adduce some instances from German newspapers.    The Paris correspondent of the _Koelnische Zeitung_ travelled home via  Brussels; his adventures are related at length in the _K.Z._ for August  4th. On August 1st he was in Brussels and complained bitterly, in his  article, about the hotel service, and excuses it by writing: \"The German  waiters had all left Brussels the day before (July 31st) to join the  army.\"    An article dated Strasbourg, August 3rd, was published in the  _Frankfurter Zeitung_ on the 6th of the same month. The writer describes  the martial scenes which he had witnessed during the preceding week, and  mentions that the officers in the garrison had received a special order  to send their wives and children away from the city several days before  martial law was proclaimed. Friday, presumably, the order came for the  garrison to march to the French frontier, for on Saturday the regiments  were entrained and left Strasbourg. Our good German friend describes the  scene in the streets: \"Alongside the ranks were the wives and children  of the called-up reservists, trying to keep step with the quickly moving  troops. Before sunset the regiments, all on a war-footing, had left the  city.\"    Every layman knows that a reservist cannot enter a barracks in civilian  attire, and emerge five minutes later in full war-kit ready for the  march. The German Imperial Chancellor affirms that not one of them had  been called up before five o'clock in the afternoon of that day. It is  true that neither the age of miracles nor the age of lies has passed  away. Perhaps Herr Bethmann-Hollweg could explain why it was impossible  to send trunk-messages on Germany's telephone system during the last  three days of July, 1914. At least, the local papers in Bavaria asserted  that that was the case.    The _Elbinger Zeitung_, August 13th, contained a reservist's letter with  this illuminating passage: \"During the last few days everybody was in  readiness; our linen, etc., had been packed and sent off in advance. On  Friday, July 31st, the order arrived that I should present myself;  mobilization had begun. With feelings of joy I changed into my uniform  and rushed to join my company. The streets were full of frightened  people with tears in their eyes. We officers pressed each others' hands  and with ardent glances exclaimed: 'At last it has come!'\"    The Chancellor based his assertion that French troops had crossed the  German frontier, on the report from the Chief of the General Staff. This  authority admitted that German soldiers on August 2nd (Sunday) had  violated the French frontier and continues with these words: \"But long  before that French airmen had dropped bombs in Southern Germany, and  French soldiers had attacked our frontier-guards in the Schlucht Pass.\"    The _Frankfurter Zeitung_, July 31st, gives Bethmann-Hollweg and the  Chief of the General Staff the lie direct. The paragraph is dated July  30th, Kolmar, and runs: \"The Schlucht Pass has just been barricaded by  German frontier guards. This is to prevent motor-lorries and such-like  vehicles from entering French territory without our permission. Several  papers have announced the alleged occupation of the Schlucht (gorge) by  French troops. The report is an absolute invention. (Die Meldung ist  voellig aus der Luft gegriffen.) I have taken the trouble to look round,  and may say that the usual tourist traffic is going on as usual.\"    The remainder of the charge is that \"long before August 2nd,\" French  airmen had dropped bombs on South German towns. The towns in question  are Frankfort and Nuremberg. The _Koelnische Zeitung_ contained this  paragraph on August 2nd: \"A military report has just come in, stating  that French airmen dropped bombs in the neighbourhood of Nuremberg this  morning. As war has not yet been declared between France and Germany,  this is a breach of international law.\"    Two remarks are necessary to supplement the above \"news.\" Firstly, in  the Reichstag, the Chancellor said this attack had occurred \"long before  August 2nd.\" Secondly, the _Cologne Gazette_ received the report from  the _military authorities_. That betrays the source from which all these  lies emanated.    The author has in his possession a Nuremberg paper (_Fraenkische  Tagepost_) for the whole of August, 1914. It contains absolutely no  mention of any air raid on or near Nuremberg. If bombs had been dropped  in the vicinity, it is quite unthinkable that the local papers should  contain no report of the affair.    President Poincare, on July 15th, 1915, declared the Nuremberg flight to  be a fable. The _Fraenkischer Kurier_ (a Nuremberg newspaper) on August  1st, 1915, contains an article which states that the news of these  alleged airmen, whom nobody saw, was spread throughout the length and  breadth of the German Empire. This same paper ridicules the whole  affair.    Another extract gives the key to the whole mystery. \"Yesterday (Monday,  August 3rd), at 8 p.m., the following official announcement was given  out for publication.    \"Up till now, the German troops, in obedience to orders given, have not  crossed the French frontier. In contrast to this _since_ yesterday  (August 2nd) French troops have attacked our frontier posts without any  declaration of war. They have crossed the German frontier at several  points, although only a few days ago the French Government assured us  that they would keep a zone ten kilometres wide free from their troops.  _Since_ last night French troops hold German places in occupation.  _Since_ yesterday bomb-dropping airmen have come into Baden and Bavaria;  further, by violating Belgian neutrality, they have fled over Belgian  territory into the Rhine province and tried to destroy our railways.  Thus France has begun an attack upon us, and thereby created a state of  war. The safety of the Empire compels us to take defensive measures. The  Kaiser has given the necessary orders. The German Ambassador in Paris  has been instructed to demand his passports.\"[25]    [Footnote 25: From the _Berliner Lokal Anzeiger_ of August 4th.]    Germany had no earthly excuse to begin war on France, and imitating the  noble example of Bismarck in forging the notorious Ems telegram which  precipitated the 1870 war, the German military authorities forged the  \"news\" of alleged attacks by French airmen and French troops. The German  Official Press Bureau completed this vile, criminal work.    Although the point is proved, a few more examples of the \"airmen\" legend  will be of interest. \"Berlin, August 2nd. _Last night_ a hostile airship  was observed flying from Kerprich to Andernach. Hostile aeroplanes were  observed flying from Dueren to Cologne. A French aeroplane was shot down  by Wesel.\" (From the _Muenchen-Augsburger Abendzeitung_, August 3rd.)    The _Frankfurter Zeitung_, August 4th, contains three separate detailed  accounts of French airmen dropping bombs on Frankfort railway station  during the previous night. The third account will suffice.    \"The military authorities in Frankfort were informed last night that a  hostile airman was flying in the direction from Darmstadt to Frankfort.  At ten minutes past one the noise of the propellers as well as bursting  bombs was heard by those standing on the command-bridge of the Central  Station. In the dark night it was impossible to see the flying-machine.  As it approached the station, where all lights were out, fifty to sixty  soldiers stationed on the command-bridge fired at the aeroplane, which  soon moved off in the direction of the Southern Station. There, too, it  came under a heavy fire from soldiers and policemen. Nothing whatever  has been found on the ground or at the station, not even parts of the  bombs. It is assumed that the hand-bombs exploded in the air.\"[26]    [Footnote 26: Yes, they burst in the air, _aus der sie gegriffen worden  sind!_ Author.]    In peace times no German editor would dare to refuse any contribution  sent to him by the military authorities. The above airman-story  sufficiently illustrates the state of affairs in war time.    \"Chemnitz, August 4th. During the past night, between 3 and 4 a.m., a  French airman dropped bombs on Chemnitz. Bombs exploded in the streets  without, however, doing any damage. Apparently the shots fired at the  aeroplane were unfortunately without result.\" _Magdeburgische Zeitung_,  August 5th.    This is an excellent example of how the Press trick is worked. A lying  report is published in a city hundreds of miles away from the scene of  the alleged occurrence. The extract where it was alleged that a French  airman was shot down at Wesel, on the Dutch frontier, was published in a  Munich paper, four hundred miles away.    The last and supreme lie in Bethmann-Hollweg's speech is the most  insidious of all. The Chancellor sketched a truly moving picture of  Germany beseeching Austria to find a _modus vivendi_ between herself and  Russia. Germany claims that up to the last minute of the last fatal week  she was working for peace. Bethmann-Hollweg insinuates that on July 31st  a last decision was to have fallen in Vienna; he does not tell us what  that decision would have been, but he maintains that Russia's military  preparations forestalled it and so the decision was never arrived at.  Thus Russia destroyed the last hope of peace; the Chancellor falsely led  his hearers to believe that it was a certain hope and that the European  peace would have been saved.    It is useless to choose one's words in writing of German diplomacy. This  is a base lie. Austria arrived at her decision previous to sending her  ultimatum to Serbia. This momentous decision was, that Russia had no  right to intervene in the quarrel, which means, in other words, that  Russia had absolutely no right to speak or use her influence in a crisis  affecting the destiny of the Slavonic peoples, neither had Russia any  right "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10201"],[0,"The Desert of Wheat (#9)"],[1,"carry--lots of it gold! The way they      talked of this money proved that they did not know the source, but      the supply was unlimited.        \"Next day Glidden could not be found. But my cowboy had learned      enough to show his methods. If these proselyters could not coax or      scare trusted men to join the I.W.W., they tried to corrupt them      with money. An' in most cases they're successful. I've not yet      sprung anythin' on my driver, Nash. But he can't get away, an'      meanwhile I'll learn much by watchin' him. Maybe through Nash I can      catch Glidden. An' so, gentlemen, here we have a plain case. An' the      menace is enough to chill the heart of every loyal citizen. Any way      you put it, if harvests can't be harvested, if wheat-fields an'      lumber forests are burned, if the state militia has to be called      out--any way you put it our government will be hampered, our      supplies kept from our allies--an' so the cause of Germany will be      helped.        \"The I.W.W. have back of them an organized power with a definite      purpose. There can hardly be any doubt that that power is Germany.      The agitators an' leaders throughout the country are well paid.      Probably they, as individuals, do not know who pays them.      Undoubtedly a little gang of men makes the deals, handles the money.      We read that every U.S. attorney is investigating the I.W.W. The      government has determined to close down on them. But lawyers an' law      are slow to act. Meanwhile the danger to us is at hand.        \"Gentlemen, to finish let me say that down in my country we're goin'      to rustle the I.W.W. in the good old Western way.\"          CHAPTER V    Golden Valley was the Garden of Eden of the Northwest. The southern  slope rose to the Blue Mountains, whence flowed down the innumerable  brooks that, uniting to form streams and rivers, abundantly watered the  valley.    The black reaches of timber extended down to the grazing-uplands, and  these bordered on the sloping golden wheat-fields, which in turn  contrasted so vividly with the lower green alfalfa-pastures; then came  the orchards with their ruddy, mellow fruit, and lastly the bottom-lands  where the vegetable-gardens attested to the wonderful richness of the  soil. From the mountain-side the valley seemed a series of colored  benches, stepping down, black to gray, and gray to gold, and gold to  green with purple tinge, and on to the perfectly ordered, many-hued  floor with its innumerable winding, tree-bordered streams glinting in  the sunlight.    The extremes of heat and cold never visited Golden Valley. Spokane and  the Bend country, just now sweltering in a torrid zone, might as well  have been in the Sahara, for all the effect it had on this garden spot  of all the Inland Empire. It was hot in the valley, but not unpleasant.  In fact, the greatest charm in this secluded vale was its pleasant  climate all the year round. No summer cyclones, no winter blizzards, no  cloudbursts or bad thunderstorms. It was a country that, once lived in,  could never be left.    There were no poor inhabitants in that great area of twenty-five hundred  miles; and there were many who were rich. Prosperous little towns dotted  the valley floor; and the many smooth, dusty, much-used roads all led to  Ruxton, a wealthy and fine city.           *       *       *       *       *    Anderson, the rancher, had driven his car to Spokane. Upon his return he  had with him a detective, whom he expected to use in the I.W.W.  investigations, and a neighbor rancher. They had left Spokane early and  had endured almost insupportable dust and heat. A welcome change began  as they slid down from the bare desert into the valley; and once across  the Copper River, Anderson began to breathe freer and to feel he was  nearing home.    \"God's country!\" he said, as he struck the first low swell of rising  land, where a cool wind from off the wooded and watered hills greeted  his face. Dust there still was, but it seemed a different kind and  smelled of apple-orchards and alfalfa-fields. Here were hard, smooth  roads, and Anderson sped his car miles and miles through a country that  was a verdant fragrant bower, and across bright, shady streams and by  white little hamlets.    At Huntington he dropped his neighbor rancher, and also the detective,  Hall, who was to go disguised into the districts overrun by the I.W.W. A  further run of forty miles put him on his own property.    Anderson owned a string of farms and ranches extending from the  bottom-lands to the timber-line of the mountains. They represented his  life of hard work and fair dealing. Many of these orchard and vegetable  lands he had tenant farmers work on shares. The uplands or wheat and  grass he operated himself. As he had accumulated property he had changed  his place of residence from time to time, at last to build a beautiful  and permanent home farther up on the valley slope than any of the  others.    It was a modern house, white, with a red roof. Situated upon a high  level bench, with the waving gold fields sloping up from it and the  green squares of alfalfa and orchards below, it appeared a landmark from  all around, and could be plainly seen from Vale, the nearest little  town, five miles away.    Anderson had always loved the open, and he wanted a place where he could  see the sun rise over the distant valley gateway, and watch it set  beyond the bold black range in the west. He could sit on his front  porch, wide and shady, and look down over two thousand acres of his own  land. But from the back porch no eye could have encompassed the limit of  his broad, swelling slopes of grain and grass.    From the main road he drove up to the right of the house, where, under a  dip of wooded slope, clustered barns, sheds, corrals, granaries, engine  and machinery houses, a store, and the homes of hired men--a little  village in itself.    The sounds he heard were a welcome home--the rush of swift water not  twenty yards from where he stopped the car in the big courtyard, the  pound of hoofs on the barn floor, the shrill whistle of a stallion that  saw and recognized him, the drawling laugh of his cowboys and the clink  of their spurs as they became aware of his return.    Nash, the suspected driver, was among those who hurried to meet the car.    Anderson's keen, covert glance made note of the driver's worried and  anxious face.    \"Nash, she'll need a lookin' over,\" he said, as he uncovered bundles in  the back seat and lifted them out.    \"All right, sir,\" replied Nash, eagerly. A note of ended strain was  significant in his voice.    \"Here, you Jake,\" cheerily called Anderson to a raw-boned, gaunt-faced  fellow who wore the garb of a cowboy.    \"Boss, I'm powerful glad to see you home,\" replied Jake, as he received  bundle after bundle until he was loaded down. Then he grinned. \"Mebbe  you want a pack-hoss.\"    \"You're hoss enough for me. Come on,\" he said, and, waving the other men  aside, he turned toward the green, shady hill above which the red and  white of the house just showed.    A bridge crossed the rushing stream. Here Jake dropped some of the  bundles, and Anderson recovered them. As he straightened up he looked  searchingly at the cowboy. Jake's yellow-gray eyes returned the gaze.  And that exchange showed these two of the same breed and sure of each  other.    \"Nawthin' come off, boss,\" he drawled, \"but I'm glad you're home.\"    \"Did Nash leave the place?\" queried Anderson.    \"Twice, at night, an' he was gone long. I didn't foller him because I  seen he didn't take no luggage, an' thet boy has some sporty clothes. He  was sure comin' back.\"    \"Any sign of his pard--that Glidden?\"    \"Nope. But there's been more'n one new feller snookin' round.\"    \"Have you heard from any of the boys with the cattle?\"    \"Yep. Bill Weeks rode down. He said a bunch of I.W.W.'s were campin'  above Blue Spring. Thet means they've moved on down to the edge of the  timber an' oncomfortable near our wheat. Bill says they're killin' our  stock fer meat.\"    \"Hum!... How many in the gang?\" inquired Anderson, darkly. His early  dealings with outlaw rustlers had not left him favorably inclined toward  losing a single steer.    \"Wal, I reckon we can't say. Mebbe five hundred, countin' all along the  valley on this side. Then we hear there's more on the other... Boss, if  they git ugly we're goin' to lose stock, wheat, an' mebbe some blood.\"    \"So many as that!\" ejaculated the rancher, in amaze.    \"They come an' go, an' lately they're most comin',\" replied Jake.    \"When do we begin cuttin' grain?\"    \"I reckon to-morrow. Adams didn't want to start till you got back. It'll  be barley an' oats fer a few days, an' then the wheat--if we can git the  men.\"    \"An' has Adams hired any?\"    \"Yes, a matter of twenty or so. They swore they wasn't I.W.W.'s, but  Adams says, an' so do I, thet some of them are men who first claimed to  our old hands thet they did belong to the I.W.W.\"    \"An' so we've got to take a chance if we're goin' to harvest two  thousand acres of wheat?\"    \"I reckon, boss.\"    \"Any reports from Ruxton way?\"    \"Wal, yes. But I reckon you'd better git your supper 'fore I tell you,  boss.\"    \"Jake, you said nothin' had come off.\"    \"Wal, nawthin' has around here. Come on now, boss. Miss Lenore says I  was to keep my mouth shut.\"    \"Jake, who's your boss? Me or Lenore?\"    \"Wal, you air. But I ain't disobeyin' Miss Lenore.\"    Anderson walked the rest of the way up the shady path to the house  without saying any more to Jake. The beautiful white house stood clear  of the grove, bright in the rays of the setting sun. A barking of dogs  greeted Anderson, and then the pattering of feet. His daughters appeared  on the porch. Kathleen, who was ten, made a dive for him, and Rose, who  was fourteen, came flying after her. Both girls were screaming joyously.  Their sunny hair danced. Lenore waited"]]]
