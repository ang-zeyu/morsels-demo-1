(1) THE MARSH FERN    _Aspidium thelypteris_. THELYPTERIS PALUSTRIS  _Dryopteris thelypteris. Nephrodium thelypteris_    [Illustration: The Marsh Fern]    These are all good names and each one is worthy to be chosen. _Aspidium_,  Greek for shield, in use for a century, adopted in all the seven editions  of Gray's Manual, is still the most familiar and pleasing term to its  friends. _Dryopteris_, Greek for oak fern, has been chosen by Underwood  and Britton and Brown and has grown in favor. _Nephrodium_, meaning  kidney-like, favored by Davenport, Waters and, of late, Clute, is a most  fitting name. THELYPTERIS, meaning lady fern, is found to be the earliest  name in use and according to rule the correct one.    [Illustration: The Marsh Fern. _Aspidium Thelypteris_]    Fronds pinnate, lanceolate, slightly or not at all narrowed at the base.  Pinnae horizontal or slightly recurved, linear-lanceolate and deeply  pinnatifid. Lobes obtuse, but appear acute when their margins are reflexed  over the sori. Veins once forked. Indusium minute. Stipes tall, lifting the  blades ten to fifteen inches above the mud, whence they spring.    The fronds of the marsh fern are apt to be sterile in deep shade. It may be  readily distinguished from the New York fern by its broad base, instead of  tapering to very small pinnae; by its long stalk, lifting the blade up into  the sunlight, and by the revolute margins of the fertile fronds, which have  suggested for it the name of \"snuff-box\" fern. It is separated from  the Massachusetts fern by its forked veins. Common in marshes and damp  woodlands; Canada to Florida and westward. While the marsh fern loves  moisture and shade it is sometimes found in dry, open fields. Miss Lilian  A. Cole, of Union, Me., reports a colony as growing on land above the swale  in which Twayblade and Adder's Tongue are found, \"around rock heaps in  open sunlight on clay soil, but homely and twisted,\" as if a former woodsy  environment had been long since cleared away while the deserted ferns  persisted.    (2) MASSACHUSETTS FERN    _Aspidium simulatum_. THELYPTERIS SIMULATA  _Dryopteris simulata. Nephrodium simulatum_    Fronds pinnate, one to three feet long, oblong-lanceolate, somewhat  narrowed at the base. Pinnae lanceolate, deeply pinnatifid, the lower most  often turned inward. Veins simple. Indusium glandular. Sori rather large.    Resembles the marsh fern, of which it was once thought to be a variety.  In some respects it is also like the New York fern, and is in fact  intermediate between the two.    [Illustration: Massachusetts Fern. _Aspidium simulatum_ 1. Sterile Frond.  2. A Fruiting Pinnule. 3. Pinnule enlarged showing venation (From the \"Fern  Bulletin\")]    That it is a distinct species was first pointed out by Raynal Dodge in  1880, and it later was named _simulatum_ by Geo. E. Davenport because of  its similarity to a form of the lady fern. It may be identified by its  thin texture and particularly by its simple veins. On account of its close  resemblance to the marsh fern, Clute would call it \"The lance-leaved Marsh  Fern,\" instead of the irrelevant name of Massachusetts Fern. Woodland  swamps usually in deep shade, New England to Maryland and westward. Often  found growing with the marsh fern.    (3) NEW YORK FERN    _Aspidium noveboracense_. THELYPTERIS NOVEBORACENSIS  _Dryopteris noveboracensis. Nephrodium noveboracense_    Fronds pinnate, tapering both ways from the middle. Pinnae lanceolate,  pinnatifid, the lowest pairs gradually shorter and deflexed. Veins simple.  Indusium minute and beset with glands.    [Illustration: New York Fern. _Aspidium noveboracense_]    Very common in woodlands, preferring a dryer soil than the marsh fern.  August. The fronds are pale green, delicate and hairy beneath along the  midrib and veins.    [Illustration: Sori of New York Fern (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt &  Co.)]    [Illustration: New York Fern. _Aspidium noveboracense_]    When bruised its resinous glands give out a pleasing, ferny odor. This  species can be distinguished from every other by the greatly reduced pinnae  at its base. Throughout North America east of the Mississippi.          THE BEECH FERNS      The beech ferns are often classed with the polypodies, because, like them,  they have no indusium; but in other ways they are more akin to the wood  ferns. Their stipes are not jointed to the root stock, nor are their sori  at the ends of the veins as in the polypodies. We here place them with  the wood ferns, retaining the familiar name _Phegopteris_ but giving  THELYPTERIS as a synonym. The fruit-dots are small, round and naked,  borne on the back of the veins below the apex. Stipe continuous with the  rootstock. Veins free. (The name _Phegopteris_ in Greek means oak or beech  fern.)    (1) OAK FERN    _Phegopteris dryopteris_. THELYPTERIS DRYOPTERIS    Fronds glabrous, broadly triangular, ternate, four to seven inches broad,  the divisions widely spreading, each division pinnate at the base. Segments  oblong, obtuse, entire or toothed. Fruit-dots near the margin. Rootstock  slender and creeping from which fronds are produced all summer, in  appearance like the small, ternate divisions of the bracken.    This dainty fern has fronds of a delicate yellow-green, \"the greenest of  all green things growing.\" Its ternate character is shown even in the  uncoiling of the fronds, the three round balls suggesting the sign of the  pawnbroker. The parts of the oak fern develop with great regularity, each  pinna, pinnule and lobe having another exactly opposite to it nearly  always. In rocky woods, common northward; also in Virginia, Kansas and  Colorado. A fine species for cultivation at the base of the artificial  rockery.    [Illustration: Oak Fern. _Phegopteris Dryopteris_]        (2) THE NORTHERN OAK FERN    _Phegopteris Robertiana. Phegopteris calcarea_    THELYPTERIS ROBERTIANA    Resembles the oak fern, but with fronds rather larger, especially the  terminal segment; also more rigid and coarser in appearance. Stalks and  fronds minutely glandular beneath. Lower pinnules of the lateral divisions  scarcely longer than the others. Often called \"Limestone Polypody,\" the  beech ferns having formerly been classed with the polypodies. Britton and  Brown designate it as the \"Scented Oak Fern.\" Canada and the northwestern  states. Rare.    [Illustration: Northern Oak Fern. _Phegopteris Robertiana_ (From Water's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]    [Illustration: BROAD BEECH FERN. Phegopteris hexagonoptera]    (3) BROAD BEECH FERN    _Phegopteris hexagonoptera_    THELYPTERIS HEXAGONOPTERA    Fronds triangular, broader than long, seven to twelve inches broad,  spreading more or less horizontally at the summit of the stipe; pubescent  and often glandular beneath; pinnae fragrant, lanceolate, the lowest pair  usually much larger than those above, having the segments elongated and cut  into lobes. Basal segments decurrent and forming a many-angled wing along  the main rachis. Fruit-dots small, near the margin.    The broad beech fern is usually larger than its sister, the long beech  fern, and extends farther south, ranging from New England to Minnesota  and southward to Florida. It is sometimes called \"six-angled polypody.\"  According to Dodge it is most common in Rhode Island and Connecticut. It  prefers rather dry, open woods. It is said to have a pleasant, ferny odor  when bruised. August.    (4) LONG BEECH FERN    _Phegopteris polypodioides_. THELYPTERIS PHEGOPTERIS    Fronds triangular, longer than broad, four to six inches long, twice  pinnatifid. Pinnae lanceolate, acuminate, the lowest pair deflexed and  standing forward; cut into oblong, obtuse segments. Fruit-dots near the  margin.    Compared with the broad beech fern this is the more northern species. While  usually quite distinct in structure, it sometimes approaches its sister  fern rather closely.    It prefers deep woods and shaded banks. Newfoundland to Alaska and  southward to the mountains of Virginia. July.    [Illustration: Long Beech Fern. _Phegopteris polypodioides_]    [Illustration: The Long Beech Fern]          THE FRAGRANT FERN    _Aspidium fragrans. Nephrodium fragrans_    THELYPTERIS FRAGRANS. _Dryopteris fragrans_    Fronds four to twelve inches high, glandular-aromatic, narrowly lanceolate  and twice pinnate or nearly so. Pinnae oblong-lanceolate, pinnate or deeply  pinnatifid. Pinnules toothed or entire nearly covered beneath with the  large, thin, imbricated indusia which are orbicular with a narrow sinus,  having the margins ragged and sparingly glanduliferous. Stipe short and  chaffy.    The fragrant fern grows on high cliffs among the mountains of northern New  England. It is reported from scattered stations in northern Maine, from  north of the White Mountains and from Sunapee Lake in New Hampshire, and  in the Green Mountains south to central Vermont, New Brunswick and to  Minnesota. Found also in Alaska and Greenland. This much-coveted fern has a  singularly sweet and lasting fragrance, compared by some to strawberries,  by others to new-mown hay and sweet brier leaves. We have seen herbarium  specimens that were mildly and pleasantly odorous after several years. When  growing the fern may be tested \"by its fragrance, its stickiness and its  beautiful brown curls.\" Evergreen. Spores ripen the middle of August.

Here is a case of separation; a combination  arises, and we believe ourselves now justified in applying to it the  words 'Elective Affinity;' it really looks as if one relation had been  deliberately chosen in preference to another.    \"Forgive me,\" said Charlotte, \"as I forgive the natural philosopher. I  cannot see any choice in this; I see a natural necessity rather, and  scarcely that. After all, it is perhaps merely a case of opportunity.  Opportunity makes relations as it makes thieves; and as long as the  talk is only of natural substances, the choice to me appears to be  altogether in the hands of the chemist who brings the creatures  together. Once, however, let them be brought together, and then God have  mercy on them. In the present case, I cannot help being sorry for the  poor acid gas, which is driven out up and down infinity again.\"    \"The acid's business,\" answered the Captain, \"is now to get connected  with water, and so serve as a mineral fountain for the refreshing of  sound or disordered mankind.\"    \"That is very well for the gypsum to say,\" said Charlotte. \"The gypsum  is all right, is a body, is provided for. The other poor, desolate  creature may have trouble enough to go through before it can find a  second home for itself.\"    \"I am much mistaken,\" said Edward, smiling, \"if there be not some little  _arriere pensee_ behind this. Confess your wickedness! You mean me by  your lime; the lime is laid hold of by the Captain, in the form of  sulphuric acid, torn away from your agreeable society, and metamorphosed  into a refractory gypsum.\"    \"If your conscience prompts you to make such a reflection,\" replied  Charlotte, \"I certainly need not distress myself. These comparisons are  pleasant and entertaining; and who is there that does not like playing  with analogies? But man is raised very many steps above these elements;  and if he has been somewhat liberal with such fine words as Election and  Elective Affinities, he will do well to turn back again into himself,  and take the opportunity of considering carefully the value and meaning  of such expressions. Unhappily, we know cases enough where a connection  apparently indissoluble between two persons, has, by the accidental  introduction of a third, been utterly destroyed, and one or the other of  the once happily united pair been driven out into the wilderness.\"    \"Then you see how much more gallant the chemists are,\" said Edward.  \"They at once add a fourth, that neither may go away empty.\"    \"Quite so,\" replied the Captain. \"And those are the cases which are  really most important and remarkable--cases where this attraction, this  affinity, this separating and combining, can be exhibited, the two pairs  severally crossing each other; where four creatures, connected  previously, as two and two, are brought into contact, and at once  forsake their first combination to form into a second. In this forsaking  and embracing, this seeking and flying, we believe that we are indeed  observing the effects of some higher determination; we attribute a sort  of will and choice to such creatures, and feel really justified in using  technical words, and speaking of 'Elective Affinities.'\"    \"Give me an instance of this,\" said Charlotte.    \"One should not spoil such things with words,\" replied the Captain. \"As  I said before, as soon as I can show you the experiment, I can make it  all intelligible and pleasant for you. For the present, I can give you  nothing but horrible scientific expressions, which at the same time will  give you no idea about the matter. You ought yourself to see these  creatures, which seem so dead, and which are yet so full of inward  energy and force, at work before your eyes. You should observe them with  a real personal interest. Now they seek each other out, attract each  other, seize, crush, devour, destroy each other, and then suddenly  reappear again out of their combinations, and come forward in fresh,  renovated, unexpected form; thus you will comprehend how we attribute to  them a sort of immortality--how we speak of them as having sense and  understanding; because we feel our own senses to be insufficient to  observe them adequately, and our reason too weak to follow them.\"    \"I quite agree,\" said Edward, \"that the strange scientific nomenclature,  to persons who have not been reconciled to it by a direct acquaintance  with or understanding of its object, must seem unpleasant, even  ridiculous; but we can easily, just for once, contrive with symbols to  illustrate what we are speaking of.\"    \"If you do not think it looks pedantic,\" answered the Captain, \"I can  put my meaning together with letters. Suppose an A connected so closely  with a B, that all sorts of means, even violence, have been made use of  to separate them, without effect. Then suppose a C in exactly the same  position with respect to D. Bring the two pairs into contact; A will  fling himself on D, C on B, without its being possible to say which had  first left its first connection, or made the first move toward the  second.\"    \"Now then,\" interposed Edward, \"till we see all this with our eyes, we  will look upon the formula as an analogy, out of which we can devise a  lesson for immediate use. You stand for A, Charlotte, and I am your B;  really and truly I cling to you, I depend on you, and follow you, just  as B does with A. C is obviously the Captain, who at present is in some  degree withdrawing me from you. So now it is only just that if you are  not to be left to solitude a D should be found for you, and that is  unquestionably the amiable little lady, Ottilie. You will not hesitate  any longer to send and fetch her.\"    \"Good,\" replied Charlotte; \"although the example does not, in my  opinion, exactly fit our case. However, we have been fortunate, at any  rate, in today for once having met all together; and these natural or  elective affinities have served to unite us more intimately. I will tell  you, that since this afternoon I have made up my mind to send for  Ottilie. My faithful housekeeper, on whom I have hitherto depended for  everything, is going to leave me shortly, to be married. (It was done at  my own suggestion, I believe, to please me.) What it is which has  decided me about Ottilie, you shall read to me. I will not look over the  pages again. Indeed, the contents of them are already known to me. Only  read, read!\"    With these words, she produced a letter, and handed it to Edward.          CHAPTER V      LETTER OF THE LADY SUPERIOR    \"Your ladyship will forgive the brevity of my present letter. The public  examinations are but just concluded, and I have to communicate to all  the parents and guardians the progress which our pupils have made during  the past year. To you I may well be brief, having to say much in few  words. Your ladyship's daughter has proved herself first in every sense  of the word. The testimonials which I inclose, and her own letter, in  which she will detail to you the prizes which she has won, and the  happiness which she feels in her success, will surely please, and I hope  delight you. For myself, it is the less necessary that I should say  much, because I see that there will soon be no more occasion to keep  with us a young lady so far advanced. I send my respects to your  ladyship, and in a short time I shall take the liberty of offering you  my opinion as to what in future may be of most advantage to her.    \"My good assistant will tell you about Ottilie.\"    LETTER OF THE ASSISTANT.    \"Our reverend superior leaves it to me to write to you of Ottilie,  partly because, with her ways of thinking about it, it would be painful  to her to say what has to be said; partly, because she herself requires  some excusing, which she would rather have done for her by me.    \"Knowing, as I did too well, how little able the good Ottilie was to  show out what lies in her, and what she is capable of, I was all along  afraid of this public examination. I was the more uneasy, as it was to  be of a kind which does not admit of any especial preparation; and even  if it had been conducted as usual, Ottilie never can be prepared to make  a display. The result has only too entirely justified my anxiety. She  has gained no prize; she is not even amongst those whose names have been  mentioned with approbation. I need not go into details. In writing, the  letters of the other girls were not so well formed, but their strokes  were far more free. In arithmetic, they were all quicker than she; and  in the more difficult problems, which she does the best, there was no  examination. In French, she was outshone and out-talked by many; and in  history she was not ready with her names and dates. In geography, there  was a want of attention to the political divisions; and for what she  could do in music there was neither time nor quiet enough for her few  modest melodies to gain attention. In drawing she certainly would have  gained the prize; her outlines were clear, and the execution most  careful and full of spirit; unhappily, she had chosen too large a  subject, and it was incomplete.    \"After the pupils were dismissed, the examiners consulted together, and  we teachers were partially admitted into the council. I very soon  observed that of Ottilie either nothing would be said at all, or if her  name was mentioned, it would be with indifference, if not absolute  disapproval. I hoped to obtain some favor for her by a candid  description of what she was, and I ventured it with the greater  earnestness, partly because I was only speaking my real convictions, and  partly because I remembered in my own younger years finding myself in  the same unfortunate case. I was listened to with attention, but as soon  as I had ended, the presiding examiner said to me very kindly but  laconically, 'We presume capabilities: they are to be converted into  accomplishments.
