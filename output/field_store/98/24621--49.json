A  good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix.    'It's a bird of its word,' said Anthea. 'I'm sure it's not deserted us.  But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near  Rochester and back, and I expect the poor thing's feeling tired out and  wants rest. I am sure we may trust it.'    The others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard.    No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since it  was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud  that the carpet had been taken away.    'She might have told us,' said Jane, 'and Panther and I would have  cleaned it with tea-leaves.'    'She's a cantankerous cat,' said Robert.    'I shan't say what I think about her,' said Anthea, primly, 'because it  would be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.'    'It's not lying to say she's a disagreeable pig, and a beastly  blue-nosed Bozwoz,' said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and  intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like  Paul.    And all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn't a  blue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born.    But I ask you to believe that they didn't do all the things on purpose  which so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresay  the things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite.  This is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happened  were as follows:    Sunday.--Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet.    Monday.--Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan.  Anthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb's  cough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. It  was the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby's  milk.    Tuesday.--A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig grave  with. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: 'The cook  oughtn't to keep dead mice in pantries.'    Wednesday.--Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added chopped  soap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too.    Thursday.--Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a  perfectly fair game of bandits in the area.    Friday.--Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink  with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left the  tap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook's shoes ruined.    On Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of time  during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did  get it back.    Mother had gone over to granny's, and had not taken the Lamb because he  had a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sure  as eggs is eggs.    'But we'll take him out, a ducky darling,' said Anthea. 'We'll take  him somewhere where you can't have whooping-cough. Don't be so silly,  Robert. If he DOES talk about it no one'll take any notice. He's always  talking about things he's never seen.'    So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and the  Lamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, and  all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, while  Jane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one last  wild hunt for the missing Phoenix.    'It's no use waiting for it,' she said, reappearing breathless in the  breakfast-room. 'But I know it hasn't deserted us. It's a bird of its  word.'    'Quite so,' said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table.    Every one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenix  perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and had  once supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had been  used as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett's  Really Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert.    'I've been here all the time,' said the Phoenix, yawning politely  behind its claw. 'If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of  invocation; it's seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure and  beautiful Greek.'    'Couldn't you tell it us in English?' asked Anthea.    'It's rather long, isn't it?' said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee.    'Couldn't you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?'    'Oh, come along, do,' said Robert, holding out his hand. 'Come along,  good old Phoenix.'    'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,' it corrected shyly.    'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then. Come along, come along,' said Robert,  impatiently, with his hand still held out.    The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist.    'This amiable youth,' it said to the others, 'has miraculously been able  to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation  into one English hexameter--a little misplaced some of the words--but--    'Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!'    'Not perfect, I admit--but not bad for a boy of his age.'    'Well, now then,' said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with the  golden Phoenix on his wrist.    'You look like the king's falconer,' said Jane, sitting down on the  carpet with the baby on her lap.    Robert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on the  carpet.    'We shall have to get back before dinner,' said Cyril, 'or cook will  blow the gaff.'    'She hasn't sneaked since Sunday,' said Anthea.    'She--' Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook,  fierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of  the carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other,  which was clenched.    'Look 'ere!' she cried, 'my only basin; and what the powers am I to  make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your  dinners? You don't deserve no dinners, so yer don't.'    'I'm awfully sorry, cook,' said Anthea gently; 'it was my fault, and  I forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling our  fortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.'    'Meant to tell me,' replied the cook; she was red with anger, and really  I don't wonder--'meant to tell! Well, _I_ mean to tell, too. I've held  my tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quiet  like, \"We mustn't expect old heads on young shoulders,\" but now I shan't  hold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me and  Eliza never so much as breathed it to your ma--though well we might--and  the saucepan, and the fish-slice, and--My gracious cats alive! what 'ave  you got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?'    'We aren't going to take him out,' said Anthea; 'at least--' She stopped  short, for though they weren't going to take him out in the Kentish  Town Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at all  where cook meant when she said 'out'. This confused the truthful Anthea.    'Out!' said the cook, 'that I'll take care you don't;' and she snatched  the Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by the  skirts and apron. 'Look here,' said Cyril, in stern desperation, 'will  you go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a  hot-water can, or something?'    'Not me,' said the cook, briefly; 'and leave this precious poppet for  you to give his deathercold to.'    'I warn you,' said Cyril, solemnly. 'Beware, ere yet it be too late.'    'Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,' said the cook, with angry  tenderness. 'They shan't take it out, no more they shan't. And--Where  did you get that there yellow fowl?' She pointed to the Phoenix.    Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would  be theirs.    'I wish,' she said suddenly, 'we were on a sunny southern shore, where  there can't be any whooping-cough.'    She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdy  scoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift  feeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on the  carpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-covered  self, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman.    The moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened her  eyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took the  opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms.    'It's all right,' she said; 'own Panther's got you. Look at the trees,  and the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. Oh DEAR, how  hot it is!'    It certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a  southern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. The  greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees and  all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! and  Fair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slope  and the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet  of jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sand  is, but yellow and changing--opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows.  And at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening,  tumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had  the happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge  of the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you can  possibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day.    Every one without an instant's hesitation tore off its  London-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb's  highwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey,  and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight  breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8390"],[0,"Buddhism and Buddhists in China (#8)"],[1," is  filial piety. The tract says:    \"Filial piety is the chief of all virtues. Heaven and Earth honor filial  piety. There is no greater sin than to cherish unfilial thoughts. The  spirits know the beginning of such thoughts. Heaven openly rewards a  heart that is filial.\"    The second one mentioned is another important family virtue, namely,  reverence:    \"The saints, sages, immortals and Buddhas are the outgrowth of  reverence. The greatest sin is to lack reverence for father and mother.  When brothers lack reverence for one another, they harm the hands and  feet. When husband and wife lack reverence, the harmony of the household  is ruined. When friends do not have reverence, they bring about  calamity.\"    Then follow similar exhortations on sincerity, justice, self-restraint,  forbearance, benevolence, generosity, absence of pride, covetousness,  lying, adultery, mutual love, self-denial, hope for the consolations of  religion and for an undivided heart ruled by peace. These are virtues  quite essential to the integrity of the family. They are taught, not in  the abstract but by the exhibition of shining examples, by vivid  representations of the rewards both here and hereafter, and by pictures  of awful punishments. So by precept and example, by threat of punishment  here and hereafter and by declaration of reward in the future Buddhism  has tried to maintain the family virtues of the Confucian system and has  attempted to permeate them by the spirit of sacrifice. Still it has  always been the sacrifice of the weak for the strong, of the young for  the aged, of the low for the high, of women for men.    _4. Services for the Dead_    Buddhism very early took over the relatively simple services for the  dead and developed them into an elaborate ritual which made very vivid  the spiritual universe which Buddhism introduced. In the sixth century a  service was held in behalf of the father-in-law of Emperor Ning Ti  (516-528 A. D.) for seven times every seven days. He feasted a thousand  monks every day, and caused seven persons to become monks. On the  hundredth day after the death he feasted ten thousand monks and caused  twenty-seven persons to become monks.    Since that time services on every seventh day after the decease until  the forty-ninth day, when a grand finale ends the ceremonies, have been  very popular.    The object of such services is to conduct the soul of the dead through  purgatory, in order that it may return to life or enter the Western  Paradise. This is done by making a pleasing offering to the guardians  and officers of purgatory, and to the gods and Bodhisattvas whose mercy  saves people. Numerous missives are consigned to the flames, informing  the rulers of the nether world about the soul of the dead; offerings of  gold and silver, of various articles of apparel, of trunks, houses, and  servants are made, all, however, made out of bamboo frames covered with  paper. Various powerful incantations are recited which force open the  gates of purgatory and let the soul out.    The services may be crowded into one day or they may be held on every  seventh day until the forty-ninth day, i.e., seven sevens. Various  explanations are given' for these services.    During the first week the soul of the dead arrives at the \"Demon Gate  Barrier.\" Here money is demanded by the demons on the ground that in his  last transmigration the deceased borrowed money. Accordingly large  quantities of silver shoes [Footnote: The silver used for this purpose  is molded, in accordance with ancient usage, in the shape of shoes and  carried about in that form by merchants.] must be sent to the dead so  that he may settle all claims and avoid beating and inconvenience.  During the second week the soul arrives at a place where he is weighed.  If the evil outweighs the good, the soul is sawn asunder and ground to  powder. In the third week he comes to the \"Bad Dog\" village. Here good  people pass unharmed, but the evil are torn by the fierce beasts until  the blood flows. In the fourth week the soul is confronted with a large  mirror in which he sees his evil deeds and their consequences, seeing  himself degraded in the next transmigration to a beast. In the fifth  week the soul views the scenes in his own village.    In the sixth week he reaches the bridge which spans the \"Inevitable  River.\" This bridge is 100,000 feet high and one and three-tenths of an  inch wide. It is crossed by riding astride as on a horse. Beneath rushes  the whirl-pool filled with serpents darting their heads to and fro. At  the foot of the bridge lictors force unwilling travelers to ascend. The  good do not cross this bridge, but are led by \"golden youth\" to gold and  silver bridges which cross the stream on either side of this \"Bridge of  Sighs.\"    In the seventh week the soul is taken first to Mrs. Wang who dispenses a  drink which blots out all memories of the earthly life. Then the  individual enters the great wheel of transmigration. This is divided  into eighty-one sections from which one hundred and eight thousand small  and tortuous paths radiate out into the four continents of the world.  The soul is directed along one of these paths and is duly reborn in the  world as an animal or as a human being or passes on into the Western  Paradise.    In imitation of this bridge a bridge is built of tables in front of the  home of the dead. At the end the tables are placed upside down and a  lantern placed on each table-leg. At night this bridge is illuminated. A  company of monks repeat their prayers and incantations, while others  mount upon the bridge to impersonate devils. The pious son with the  tablet of his deceased parent comes to take his father over the bridge.  When his way is disputed by the demons, he falls on his knees and begs  and gives them money, negotiating the passage at last with the aid of a  large quantity of silver.    Another ceremony is the breaking through purgatory. Five supplications  duly signed are addressed to the proper authorities, four being  suspended at each of the four sides of the table and one at the center.  Tiles are then placed over the table or on the ground. After  incantations have been repeated to the accompaniment of the sounding of  the bell and the wooden fish, the supplications are burned and the tiles  are broken as a symbol of breaking through purgatory and of releasing  the soul.    Thus Buddhism has taken over the most important function of ancestor  worship, has extended it and made it more significant to each individual  as well as to the family.          VI      BUDDHISM AND SOCIAL LIFE    _1. How the Laity is Trained in Buddhist Ideas_    A common way of emphasizing moral ideas among the people by Buddhist  teachers is the use of tracts purporting to have a divine origin. The  following gives the substance of such a tract:    Not long ago in the province of Shantung, there was a sharp and sudden  clap of thunder. After the frightened people had collected their wits,  they discovered a small book written in red in front of the house of a  certain Mr. Li. Mr. Li picked up the book, copied it and read it  reverently. He gave a copy to Mr. Ma, the prefect, but Mr. Ma did not  believe in the book. Thereupon Maitrêya, the Messiah of the Buddhists,  spoke from the sky as follows:        \"These are the years of the final age. The people under    heaven do not reverence Heaven and Earth, they are not    filial to father and mother, they do not respect their    superiors. They cheat the fatherless, impose upon the    widow, oppress the weak; they use large weights for    themselves and small measures for others. They injure the good.    They covet for their own profit. They cheat men of money,    use the five grains carelessly, kill the cow that draws the    plow. This volume is sent for their special benefit. If    they recite it they will avoid trouble. If they disbelieve,    the years with the cyclical character _Ping_ and _Ting_ will    have fields without men to plant them and houses without    men to live in them. In the fifth month of these years    evil serpents will infest the whole country. In the eighth    and ninth months the bodies of evil men will fill the land.      \"Those who believe this book and propagate its teachings    will not encounter the ten sorrows of the age: war,    fire, no peace day and night, separation of man and wife,    the scattering of the sons and daughters, evil men spread    over the country, dead bones unburied, clothing with no    one to wear it, rice with no one to eat it, and the difficulty    of ever seeing a peaceful year. Sâkyamuni foreseeing this    final age sent down this volume in Shantung. The Goddess    of Mercy saw the sorrows of all living beings.    Maitrêya commanded the two runners of T'ai Shan, the    god of the Eastern Mountain, to investigate the conduct    of men and as a first punishment to increase the price of    rice, and then besides the ten sorrows already mentioned    above, to inflict the punishments of flood, fire, wind,    thunder, tigers, snakes, sword, disease, famine and cold.    The rule of Sâkyamuni which has lasted twelve thousand    years is now fulfilled, and Maitrêya succeeds to his place.\"      These sorrows may be escaped by reciting this sutra whose substance we  find above. If it is repeated three times the person will escape the  calamity of fire and water. If one man passes it on to ten men and ten  men pass it on to a hundred, they will escape the calamities of sword,  disease and imprisonment, and receive blessings which cannot be  measured. He who in addition to repeating the sutra practices abstinence  will insure peace for himself. He who presents one hundred copies to  others will insure his personal peace. He who presents a thousand copies  will insure the peace of his family. He who is attacked by disease, may  escape it by taking five cash of the reign of Shun Chih (1644-1661 A.  D.), the"]]]
