And then, after looking around  the group, he inquired, \"What is that on your finger, Trot?\"    \"A ring.  The Mermaids gave it to me,\" she explained, \"and if ever I'm  in trouble when I'm on the water, I can call the Mermaids and they'll  come and help me.  But the Mermaids can't help me on the land, you  know, 'cause they swim, and--and--they haven't any legs.\"    \"True enough,\" repeated the Wizard, more sadly.    There was a big, broad, spreading tree near the edge of the gulf, and  as the sun was hot above them, they all gathered under the shade of the  tree to study the problem of what to do next.  \"If we had a long rope,\"  said Betsy, \"we could fasten it to this tree and let the other end of  it down into the gulf and all slide down it.\"    \"Well, what then?\" asked the Wizard.    \"Then, if we could manage to throw the rope up the other side,\"  explained the girl, \"we could all climb it and be on the other side of  the gulf.\"    \"There are too many 'if's' in that suggestion,\" remarked the little  Wizard.  \"And you must remember that the other side is nothing but  spinning mountains, so we couldn't possibly fasten a rope to them, even  if we had one.\"    \"That rope idea isn't half bad, though,\" said the Patchwork Girl, who  had been dancing dangerously near to the edge of the gulf.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Dorothy.    The Patchwork Girl suddenly stood still and cast her button eyes around  the group.  \"Ha, I have it!\" she exclaimed.  \"Unharness the Sawhorse,  somebody.  My fingers are too clumsy.\"    \"Shall we?\" asked Button-Bright doubtfully, turning to the others.    \"Well, Scraps has a lot of brains, even if she IS stuffed with cotton,\"  asserted the Wizard.  \"If her brains can help us out of this trouble,  we ought to use them.\"    So he began unharnessing the Sawhorse, and Button-Bright and Dorothy  helped him.  When they had removed the harness, the Patchwork Girl told  them to take it all apart and buckle the straps together, end to end.  And after they had done this, they found they had one very long strap  that was stronger than any rope.  \"It would reach across the gulf  easily,\" said the Lion, who with the other animals had sat on his  haunches and watched this proceeding.  \"But I don't see how it could be  fastened to one of those dizzy mountains.\"    Scraps had no such notion as that in her baggy head.  She told them to  fasten one end of the strap to a stout limb of the tree, pointing to  one which extended quite to the edge of the gulf.  Button-Bright did  that, climbing the tree and then crawling out upon the limb until he  was nearly over the gulf.  There he managed to fasten the strap, which  reached to the ground below, and then he slid down it and was caught by  the Wizard, who feared he might fall into the chasm.  Scraps was  delighted.  She seized the lower end of the strap, and telling them all  to get out of her way, she went back as far as the strap would reach  and then made a sudden run toward the gulf.  Over the edge she swung,  clinging to the strap until it had gone as far as its length permitted,  when she let go and sailed gracefully through the air until she  alighted upon the mountain just in front of them.    Almost instantly, as the great cone continued to whirl, she was sent  flying against the next mountain in the rear, and that one had only  turned halfway around when Scraps was sent flying to the next mountain  behind it.  Then her patchwork form disappeared from view entirely, and  the amazed watchers under the tree wondered what had become of her.  \"She's gone, and she can't get back,\" said the Woozy.    \"My, how she bounded from one mountain to another!\" exclaimed the Lion.    \"That was because they whirl so fast,\" the Wizard explained.  \"Scraps  had nothing to hold on to, and so of course she was tossed from one  hill to another.  I'm afraid we shall never see the poor Patchwork Girl  again.\"    \"I shall see her,\" declared the Woozy.  \"Scraps is an old friend of  mine, and if there are really Thistle-Eaters and Giants on the other  side of those tops, she will need someone to protect her.  So here I  go!\"  He seized the dangling strap firmly in his square mouth, and in  the same way that Scraps had done swung himself over the gulf.  He let  go the strap at the right moment and fell upon the first whirling  mountain.  Then he bounded to the next one back of it--not on his feet,  but \"all mixed up,\" as Trot said--and then he shot across to another  mountain, disappearing from view just as the Patchwork Girl had done.    \"It seems to work, all right,\" remarked Button-Bright.  \"I guess I'll  try it.\"    \"Wait a minute,\" urged the Wizard.  \"Before any more of us make this  desperate leap into the beyond, we must decide whether all will go or  if some of us will remain behind.\"    \"Do you s'pose it hurt them much to bump against those mountains?\"  asked Trot.    \"I don't s'pose anything could hurt Scraps or the Woozy,\" said Dorothy,  \"and nothing can hurt ME, because I wear the Magic Belt.  So as I'm  anxious to find Ozma, I mean to swing myself across too.\"    \"I'll take my chances,\" decided Button-Bright.    \"I'm sure it will hurt dreadfully, and I'm afraid to do it,\" said the  Lion, who was already trembling, \"but I shall do it if Dorothy does.\"    \"Well, that will leave Betsy and the Mule and Trot,\" said the Wizard,  \"for of course I shall go that I may look after Dorothy.  Do you two  girls think you can find your way back home again?\" he asked,  addressing Trot and Betsy.    \"I'm not afraid.  Not much, that is,\" said Trot.  \"It looks risky, I  know, but I'm sure I can stand it if the others can.\"    \"If it wasn't for leaving Hank,\" began Betsy in a hesitating voice.    But the Mule interrupted her by saying, \"Go ahead if you want to, and  I'll come after you.  A mule is as brave as a lion any day.\"    \"Braver,\" said the Lion, \"for I'm a coward, friend Hank, and you are  not.  But of course the Sawhorse--\"    \"Oh, nothing ever hurts ME,\" asserted the Sawhorse calmly.  \"There's  never been any question about my going.  I can't take the Red Wagon,  though.\"    \"No, we must leave the wagon,\" said the wizard, \"and also we must leave  our food and blankets, I fear.  But if we can defy these Merry-Go-Round  Mountains to stop us, we won't mind the sacrifice of some of our  comforts.\"    \"No one knows where we're going to land!\" remarked the Lion in a voice  that sounded as if he were going to cry.    \"We may not land at all,\" replied Hank, \"but the best way to find out  what will happen to us is to swing across as Scraps and the Woozy have  done.\"    \"I think I shall go last,\" said the Wizard, \"so who wants to go first?\"    \"I'll go,\" decided Dorothy.    \"No, it's my turn first,\" said Button-Bright.   \"Watch me!\"    Even as he spoke, the boy seized the strap, and after making a run  swung himself across the gulf.  Away he went, bumping from hill to hill  until he disappeared.  They listened intently, but the boy uttered no  cry until he had been gone some moments, when they heard a faint  \"Hullo-a!\" as if called from a great distance.  The sound gave them  courage, however, and Dorothy picked up Toto and held him fast under  one arm while with the other hand she seized the strap and bravely  followed after Button-Bright.    When she struck the first whirling mountain, she fell upon it quite  softly, but before she had time to think, she flew through the air and  lit with a jar on the side of the next mountain.  Again she flew and  alighted, and again and still again, until after five successive bumps  she fell sprawling upon a green meadow and was so dazed and bewildered  by her bumpy journey across the Merry-Go-Round Mountains that she lay  quite still for a time to collect her thoughts.  Toto had escaped from  her arms just as she fell, and he now sat beside her panting with  excitement.  Then Dorothy realized that someone was helping her to her  feet, and here was Button-Bright on one side of her and Scraps on the  other, both seeming to be unhurt.  The next object her eyes fell upon  was the Woozy, squatting upon his square back end and looking at her  reflectively, while Toto barked joyously to find his mistress unhurt  after her whirlwind trip.    \"Good!\" said the Woozy.  \"Here's another and a dog, both safe and  sound.  But my word, Dorothy, you flew some!  If you could have seen  yourself, you'd have been absolutely astonished.\"    \"They say 'Time flies,'\" laughed Button-Bright, \"but Time never made a  quicker journey than that.\"    Just then, as Dorothy turned around to look at the whirling mountains,  she was in time to see tiny Trot come flying from the nearest hill to  fall upon the soft grass not a yard away from where she stood.  Trot  was so dizzy she couldn't stand at first, but she wasn't at all hurt,  and presently Betsy came flying to them and would have bumped into the  others had they not retreated in time to avoid her.  Then, in quick  succession, came the Lion, Hank and the Sawhorse, bounding from  mountain to mountain to fall safely upon the greensward.  Only the  Wizard was now left behind, and they waited so long for him that  Dorothy began to be worried.    But suddenly he came flying from the nearest mountain and tumbled heels  over head beside them.  Then they saw that he had wound two of their  blankets around his body to keep the bumps from hurting him and had  fastened the blankets with some of the spare straps from the harness of  the Sawhorse.          CHAPTER 8    THE MYSTERIOUS CITY      There they sat upon the grass, their heads still swimming from their  dizzy flights, and looked at one another in silent bewilderment.  But  presently, when assured that no one was injured, they grew more calm  and collected, and the Lion said with a sigh of relief, \"Who would have  thought those Merry-Go-Round Mountains were made of rubber?\"    \"Are they really rubber?\" asked Trot.    \"They must be,\" replied the Lion, \"for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960"],[0,"The Tin Woodman of Oz (#8)"],[1,"said:    \"The next thing on the programme is to change your forms.\"    \"Have you decided what forms to give us?\" asked the Scarecrow, uneasily.    \"Yes; I dreamed it all out while I was asleep. This Tin Man seems a  very solemn person \"--indeed, the Tin Woodman was looking solemn, just  then, for he was greatly disturbed--\"so I shall change him into an Owl.\"    All she did was to point one finger at him as she spoke, but  immediately the form of the Tin Woodman began to change and in a few  seconds Nick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies, had been transformed  into an Owl, with eyes as big as saucers and a hooked beak and strong  claws.  But he was still tin. He was a Tin Owl, with tin legs and beak  and eyes and feathers. When he flew to the back of a chair and perched  upon it, his tin feathers rattled against one another with a tinny  clatter. The Giantess seemed  much amused by the Tin Owl's appearance,  for her laugh was big and jolly.    \"You're not liable to get lost,\" said she, \"for your wings and feathers  will make a racket wherever you go. And, on my word, a Tin Owl is so  rare and pretty that it is an improvement on the ordinary bird. I did  not intend to make you tin, but I forgot to wish you to be meat.  However, tin you were, and tin you are, and as it's too late to change  you, that settles it.\"    Until now the Scarecrow had rather doubted the possibility of Mrs.  Yoop's being able to transform him, or his friend the Tin Woodman, for  they were not made as ordinary people are. He had worried more over  what might happen to Woot than to himself, but now he began to worry  about himself.    \"Madam,\" he said hastily, \"I consider this action very impolite. It may  even be called rude, considering we are your guests.\"    \"You are not guests, for I did not invite you here,\" she replied.    \"Perhaps not; but we craved hospitality. We threw ourselves upon your  mercy, so to speak, and we now find you have no mercy. Therefore, if  you will excuse the expression, I must say it is downright wicked to  take our proper forms away from us and give us others that we do not  care for.\"    \"Are you trying to make me angry?\" she asked, frowning.    \"By no means,\" said the Scarecrow; \"I'm just trying to make you act  more ladylike.\"    \"Oh, indeed! In my opinion, Mr. Scarecrow, you are now acting like a  bear--so a Bear you shall be!\"    Again the dreadful finger pointed, this time in the Scarecrow's  direction, and at once his form began to change. In a few seconds he  had become a small Brown Bear, but he was stuffed with straw as he had  been before, and when the little Brown Bear shuffled across the floor  he was just as wobbly as the Scarecrow had been and moved just as  awkwardly.    Woot was amazed, but he was also thoroughly frightened.    \"Did it hurt?\" he asked the little Brown Bear.    \"No, of course not,\" growled the Scarecrow in the Bear's form; \"but I  don't like walking on four legs; it's undignified.\"    \"Consider my humiliation!\" chirped the Tin Owl, trying to settle its  tin feathers smoothly with its tin beak. \"And I can't see very well,  either. The light seems to hurt my eyes.\"    \"That's because you are an Owl,\" said Woot. \"I think you will see  better in the dark.\"    \"Well,\" remarked the Giantess, \"I'm very well pleased with these new  forms, for my part, and I'm sure you will like them better when you get  used to them. So now,\" she added, turning to the boy, \"it is your turn.\"    \"Don't you think you'd better leave me as I am?\" asked Woot in a  trembling voice.    \"No,\" she replied, \"I'm going to make a Monkey of you. I love  monkeys--they're so cute!--and I think a Green Monkey will be lots of  fun and amuse me when I am sad.\"    Woot shivered, for again the terrible magic finger pointed, and pointed  directly his way. He felt himself changing; not so very much, however,  and it didn't hurt him a bit. He looked down at his limbs and body and  found that his clothes were gone and his skin covered with a fine,  silk-like green fur. His hands and feet were now those of a monkey. He  realized he really was a monkey, and his first feeling was one of  anger. He began to chatter as monkeys do. He bounded to the seat of a  giant chair, and then to its back and with a wild leap sprang upon the  laughing Giantess. His idea was to seize her hair and pull it out by  the roots, and so have revenge for her wicked transformations. But she  raised her hand and said:    \"Gently, my dear Monkey--gently!  You're not angry; you're happy as can  be!\"    Woot stopped short. No; he wasn't a bit angry now; he felt as  good-humored and gay as ever he did when a boy. Instead of pulling Mrs.  Yoop's hair, he perched on her shoulder and smoothed her soft cheek  with his hairy paw. In return, she smiled at the funny green animal and  patted his head.    \"Very good,\" said the Giantess. \"Let us all become friends and be happy  together. How is my Tin Owl feeling?\"    \"Quite comfortable,\" said the Owl. \"I don't like it, to be sure, but  I'm not going to allow my new form to make me unhappy. But, tell me,  please: what is a Tin Owl good for?\"    \"You are only good to make me laugh,\" replied the Giantess.    \"Will a stuffed Bear also make you laugh?\" inquired the Scarecrow,  sitting back on his haunches to look up at her.    \"Of course,\" declared the Giantess; \"and I have added a little magic to  your transformations to make you all contented with wearing your new  forms. I'm sorry I didn't think to do that when I transformed  Polychrome into a Canary-Bird. But perhaps, when she sees how cheerful  you are, she will cease to be silent and sullen and take to singing. I  will go get the bird and let you see her.\"    With this, Mrs. Yoop went into the next room and soon returned bearing  a golden cage in which sat upon a swinging perch a lovely yellow  Canary. \"Polychrome,\" said the Giantess, \"permit me to introduce to you  a Green Monkey, which used to be a boy called Woot the Wanderer, and a  Tin Owl, which used to be a Tin Woodman named Nick Chopper, and a  straw-stuffed little Brown Bear which used to be a live Scarecrow.\"    \"We already know one another,\" declared the Scarecrow. \"The bird is  Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter, and she and I used to be good  friends.\"    \"Are you really my old friend, the Scarecrow?\" asked; the bird, in a  sweet, low voice.    \"There!\" cried Mrs. Yoop; \"that's the first time she has spoken since  she was transformed.\"    \"I am really your old friend,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"but you must  pardon me for appearing just now in this brutal form.\"    \"I am a bird, as you are, dear Poly,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"but, alas!  a Tin Owl is not as beautiful as a Canary-Bird.\"    \"How dreadful it all is!\" sighed the Canary. \"Couldn't you manage to  escape from this terrible Yookoohoo?\"    \"No,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"we tried to escape, but failed. She  first made us her prisoners and then transformed us. But how did she  manage to get you, Polychrome?\"    \"I was asleep, and she took unfair advantage of me,\" answered the bird  sadly. \"Had I been awake, I could easily have protected myself.\"    \"Tell me,\" said the Green Monkey earnestly, as he came close to the  cage, \"what must we do, Daughter of the Rainbow, to escape from these  transformations? Can't you help us, being a Fairy?\"    \"At present I am powerless to help even myself,\" replied the Canary.    \"That's the exact truth!\" exclaimed the Giantess, who seemed pleased to  hear the bird talk, even though it complained; \"you are all helpless  and in my power, so you may as well make up your minds to accept your  fate and be content. Remember that you are transformed for good, since  no magic on earth can break your enchantments. I am now going out for  my morning walk, for each day after breakfast I walk sixteen times  around my castle for exercise. Amuse yourselves while I am gone, and  when I return I hope to find you all reconciled and happy.\"    So the Giantess walked to the door by which our friends had entered the  great hall and spoke one word: \"Open!\" Then the door swung open and  after Mrs. Yoop had passed out it closed again with a snap as its  powerful bolts shot into place. The Green Monkey had rushed toward the  opening, hoping to escape, but he was too late and only got a bump on  his nose as the door slammed shut.          Chapter Seven    The Lace Apron      \"Now,\" said the Canary, in a tone more brisk than before, \"we may talk  together more freely, as Mrs. Yoop cannot hear us. Perhaps we can  figure out a way to escape.\"    \"Open!\" said Woot the Monkey, still facing the door; but his command  had no effect and he slowly rejoined the others.    \"You cannot open any door or window in this enchanted castle unless you  are wearing the Magic Apron,\" said the Canary.    \"What Magic Apron do you mean?\" asked the Tin Owl, in a curious voice.    \"The lace one, which the Giantess always wears. I have been her  prisoner, in this cage, for several weeks, and she hangs my cage in her  bedroom every night, so that she can keep her eye on me,\" explained  Polychrome the Canary. \"Therefore I have discovered that it is the  Magic Apron that opens the doors and windows, and nothing else can move  them. When she goes to bed, Mrs. Yoop hangs her apron on the bedpost,  and one morning she forgot to put it on when she commanded the door to  open, and the door would not move. So then she put on the lace apron  and the door obeyed her. That was how I learned the magic power of the  apron.\"    \"I see--I see!\" said the little Brown Bear, wagging his stuffed head.  \"Then, if we could get the apron from Mrs. Yoop, we could open the  doors and escape from our prison.\"    \"That is true, and it is the plan I was about to suggest,\" replied  Polychrome  the  Canary-Bird. \"However, I don't believe the Owl could  steal the apron, or even the Bear, but perhaps the Monkey could hide in  her room at night and get the apron while she is asleep.\"    \"I'll"]]]
