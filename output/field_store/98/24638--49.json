[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8795"],[0,"The Divine Comedy (#8)"],[1," mine what I did tread on, while I went  Low bending.  Now swell out; and with stiff necks  Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,  Lest they descry the evil of your path!    I noted not (so busied was my thought)  How much we now had circled of the mount,  And of his course yet more the sun had spent,  When he, who with still wakeful caution went,  Admonish'd: \"Raise thou up thy head: for know  Time is not now for slow suspense.  Behold  That way an angel hasting towards us!  Lo!  Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return  From service on the day.  Wear thou in look  And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,  That gladly he may forward us aloft.  Consider that this day ne'er dawns again.\"    Time's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst,  I could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.    The goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white  In vesture, and with visage casting streams  Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.  His arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake:  \"Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now  Th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd.\"    A scanty few are they, who when they hear  Such tidings, hasten.  O ye race of men  Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind  So slight to baffle ye?  He led us on  Where the rock parted; here against my front  Did beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare  In safety on my way.  As to ascend  That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands  (O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down  On the well-guided city,) up the right  Th' impetuous rise is broken by the steps  Carv'd in that old and simple age, when still  The registry and label rested safe;  Thus is th' acclivity reliev'd, which here  Precipitous from the other circuit falls:  But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.    As ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain  Ineffable, sang: \"Blessed are the poor  In spirit.\"  Ah how far unlike to these  The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,  There shrieks of woe!  We climb the holy stairs:  And lighter to myself by far I seem'd  Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:  \"Say, master, of what heavy thing have I  Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of toil  Affects me journeying?\"  He in few replied:  \"When sin's broad characters, that yet remain  Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd,  Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,  Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will  Be so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel  No sense of labour, but delight much more  Shall wait them urg'd along their upward way.\"    Then like to one, upon whose head is plac'd  Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks  Of others as they pass him by; his hand  Lends therefore help to' assure him, searches, finds,  And well performs such office as the eye  Wants power to execute: so stretching forth  The fingers of my right hand, did I find  Six only of the letters, which his sword  Who bare the keys had trac'd upon my brow.  The leader, as he mark'd mine action, smil'd.          CANTO XIII    We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood  Upon the second buttress of that mount  Which healeth him who climbs.  A cornice there,  Like to the former, girdles round the hill;  Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.    Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth  The rampart and the path, reflecting nought  But the rock's sullen hue.  \"If here we wait  For some to question,\" said the bard, \"I fear  Our choice may haply meet too long delay.\"    Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes  He fastn'd, made his right the central point  From whence to move, and turn'd the left aside.  \"O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,  Conduct us thou,\" he cried, \"on this new way,  Where now I venture, leading to the bourn  We seek.  The universal world to thee  Owes warmth and lustre.  If no other cause  Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.\"    Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,  In brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will  Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard  Spirits invisible, who courteously  Unto love's table bade the welcome guest.  The voice, that firstlew by, call'd forth aloud,  \"They have no wine;\" so on behind us past,  Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost  In the faint distance, when another came  Crying, \"I am Orestes,\" and alike  Wing'd its fleet way.  \"Oh father!\"  I exclaim'd,  \"What tongues are these?\"  and as I question'd, lo!  A third exclaiming, \"Love ye those have wrong'd you.\"    \"This circuit,\" said my teacher, \"knots the scourge  For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn  By charity's correcting hand.  The curb  Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear  (If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,  Where pardon sets them free.  But fix thine eyes  Intently through the air, and thou shalt see  A multitude before thee seated, each  Along the shelving grot.\"  Then more than erst  I op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw  Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;  And when we pass'd a little forth, I heard  A crying, \"Blessed Mary! pray for us,  Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!\"    I do not think there walks on earth this day  Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd  With pity at the sight that next I saw.  Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now  I stood so near them, that their semblances  Came clearly to my view.  Of sackcloth vile  Their cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one  Did stay another, leaning, and all lean'd  Against the cliff.  E'en thus the blind and poor,  Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,  Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,    So most to stir compassion, not by sound  Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,  The sight of mis'ry.  And as never beam  Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,  E'en so was heav'n a niggard unto these  Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,  A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,  As for the taming of a haggard hawk.    It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look  On others, yet myself the while unseen.  To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.  He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,  Nor waited for my questioning, but said:  \"Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.\"    On that part of the cornice, whence no rim  Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;  On the' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks  Bathing devout with penitential tears,  That through the dread impalement forc'd a way.    I turn'd me to them, and \"O shades!\" said I,    \"Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine  The lofty light, sole object of your wish,  So may heaven's grace clear whatsoe'er of foam  Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth  The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,  As ye declare (for so shall ye impart  A boon I dearly prize) if any soul  Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance  That soul may profit, if I learn so much.\"    \"My brother, we are each one citizens  Of one true city.  Any thou wouldst say,  Who lived a stranger in Italia's land.\"    So heard I answering, as appeal'd, a voice  That onward came some space from whence I stood.    A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark'd  Expectance.  Ask ye how?  The chin was rais'd  As in one reft of sight.  \"Spirit,\" said I,  \"Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be  That which didst answer to me,) or by place  Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.\"    \"I was,\" it answer'd, \"of Sienna: here  I cleanse away with these the evil life,  Soliciting with tears that He, who is,  Vouchsafe him to us.  Though Sapia nam'd  In sapience I excell'd not, gladder far  Of others' hurt, than of the good befell me.  That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,  Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it.  When now my years slop'd waning down the arch,  It so bechanc'd, my fellow citizens  Near Colle met their enemies in the field,  And I pray'd God to grant what He had will'd.  There were they vanquish'd, and betook themselves  Unto the bitter passages of flight.  I mark'd the hunt, and waxing out of bounds  In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,  And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,  Cried, \"It is over.  Heav'n! fear thee not.\"  Upon my verge of life I wish'd for peace  With God; nor repentance had supplied  What I did lack of duty, were it not  The hermit Piero, touch'd with charity,  In his devout orisons thought on me.  \"But who art thou that question'st of our state,  Who go'st to my belief, with lids unclos'd,  And breathest in thy talk?\"--\"Mine eyes,\" said I,  \"May yet be here ta'en from me; but not long;  For they have not offended grievously  With envious glances.  But the woe beneath  Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.  That nether load already weighs me down.\"    She thus: \"Who then amongst us here aloft  Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?\"    \"He,\" answer'd I, \"who standeth mute beside me.  I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,  If thou desire I yonder yet should move  For thee my mortal feet.\"--\"Oh!\" she replied,  \"This is so strange a thing, it is great sign  That God doth love thee.  Therefore with thy prayer  Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,  Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet  E'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame  Amongst my kindred.  Them shalt thou behold  With that vain multitude, who set their hope  On Telamone's haven, there to fail  Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream  They sought of Dian call'd: but they who lead  Their navies, more than ruin'd hopes shall mourn.\"          CANTO XIV    \"Say who is he around our mountain winds,  Or ever death has prun'd his wing for flight,  That opes his eyes and covers them at will?\"    \"I know not who he is, but know thus much  He comes not singly.  Do thou ask of him,  For thou art nearer to him, and take heed  Accost him gently, so that he may speak.\"    Thus on the right two Spirits bending each  Toward the other, talk'd of me, then both  Addressing me, their faces backward lean'd,  And thus the one began: \"O soul, who yet  Pent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#8)"],[1,"made me seem like needle to the star,  In turning to its whereabout, and thus  Began: \"The love, that makes me beautiful,  Prompts me to tell of th' other guide, for whom  Such good of mine is spoken.  Where one is,  The other worthily should also be;  That as their warfare was alike, alike  Should be their glory.  Slow, and full of doubt,  And with thin ranks, after its banner mov'd  The army of Christ (which it so clearly cost  To reappoint), when its imperial Head,  Who reigneth ever, for the drooping host  Did make provision, thorough grace alone,  And not through its deserving.  As thou heard'st,  Two champions to the succour of his spouse  He sent, who by their deeds and words might join  Again his scatter'd people.  In that clime,  Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold  The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself  New-garmented; nor from those billows far,  Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,  The sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abides  The happy Callaroga, under guard  Of the great shield, wherein the lion lies  Subjected and supreme.  And there was born  The loving million of the Christian faith,  The hollow'd wrestler, gentle to his own,  And to his enemies terrible.  So replete  His soul with lively virtue, that when first  Created, even in the mother's womb,  It prophesied.  When, at the sacred font,  The spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,  Where pledge of mutual safety was exchang'd,  The dame, who was his surety, in her sleep  Beheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him  And from his heirs to issue.  And that such  He might be construed, as indeed he was,  She was inspir'd to name him of his owner,  Whose he was wholly, and so call'd him Dominic.  And I speak of him, as the labourer,  Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be  His help-mate.  Messenger he seem'd, and friend  Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,  Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.  Many a time his nurse, at entering found  That he had ris'n in silence, and was prostrate,  As who should say, \"My errand was for this.\"  O happy father!  Felix rightly nam'd!  O favour'd mother! rightly nam'd Joanna!  If that do mean, as men interpret it.  Not for the world's sake, for which now they pore  Upon Ostiense and Taddeo's page,  But for the real manna, soon he grew  Mighty in learning, and did set himself  To go about the vineyard, that soon turns  To wan and wither'd, if not tended well:  And from the see (whose bounty to the just  And needy is gone by, not through its fault,  But his who fills it basely, he besought,  No dispensation for commuted wrong,  Nor the first vacant fortune, nor the tenth),  That to God's paupers rightly appertain,  But, 'gainst an erring and degenerate world,  Licence to fight, in favour of that seed,  From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.  Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,  Forth on his great apostleship he far'd,  Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;  And, dashing 'gainst the stocks of heresy,  Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout.  Thence many rivulets have since been turn'd,  Over the garden Catholic to lead  Their living waters, and have fed its plants.    \"If such one wheel of that two-yoked car,  Wherein the holy church defended her,  And rode triumphant through the civil broil.  Thou canst not doubt its fellow's excellence,  Which Thomas, ere my coming, hath declar'd  So courteously unto thee.  But the track,  Which its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:  That mouldy mother is where late were lees.  His family, that wont to trace his path,  Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelong  To rue the gathering in of their ill crop,  When the rejected tares in vain shall ask  Admittance to the barn.  I question not  But he, who search'd our volume, leaf by leaf,  Might still find page with this inscription on't,  'I am as I was wont.'  Yet such were not  From Acquasparta nor Casale, whence  Of those, who come to meddle with the text,  One stretches and another cramps its rule.  Bonaventura's life in me behold,  From Bagnororegio, one, who in discharge  Of my great offices still laid aside  All sinister aim.  Illuminato here,  And Agostino join me: two they were,  Among the first of those barefooted meek ones,  Who sought God's friendship in the cord: with them  Hugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,  And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining,  Nathan the prophet, Metropolitan  Chrysostom, and Anselmo, and, who deign'd  To put his hand to the first art, Donatus.  Raban is here: and at my side there shines  Calabria's abbot, Joachim, endow'd  With soul prophetic.  The bright courtesy  Of friar Thomas, and his goodly lore,  Have mov'd me to the blazon of a peer  So worthy, and with me have mov'd this throng.\"          CANTO XIII    Let him, who would conceive what now I saw,  Imagine (and retain the image firm,  As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),  Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host  Selected, that, with lively ray serene,  O'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine  The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,  Spins ever on its axle night and day,  With the bright summit of that horn which swells  Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,  T' have rang'd themselves in fashion of two signs  In heav'n, such as Ariadne made,  When death's chill seized her; and that one of them  Did compass in the other's beam; and both  In such sort whirl around, that each should tend  With opposite motion and, conceiving thus,  Of that true constellation, and the dance  Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain  As 't were the shadow; for things there as much  Surpass our usage, as the swiftest heav'n  Is swifter than the Chiana.  There was sung  No Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but  Three Persons in the Godhead, and in one  Substance that nature and the human join'd.    The song fulfill'd its measure; and to us  Those saintly lights attended, happier made  At each new minist'ring.  Then silence brake,  Amid th' accordant sons of Deity,  That luminary, in which the wondrous life  Of the meek man of God was told to me;  And thus it spake: \"One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,  And its grain safely stor'd, sweet charity  Invites me with the other to like toil.    \"Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib  Was ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste  All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'd  By the keen lance, both after and before  Such satisfaction offer'd, as outweighs  Each evil in the scale, whate'er of light  To human nature is allow'd, must all  Have by his virtue been infus'd, who form'd  Both one and other: and thou thence admir'st  In that I told thee, of beatitudes  A second, there is none, to his enclos'd  In the fifth radiance.  Open now thine eyes  To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see  Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,  As centre in the round.  That which dies not,  And that which can die, are but each the beam  Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire  Engendereth loving; for that lively light,  Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'd  From him, nor from his love triune with them,  Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,  Mirror'd, as 't were in new existences,  Itself unalterable and ever one.    \"Descending hence unto the lowest powers,  Its energy so sinks, at last it makes  But brief contingencies: for so I name  Things generated, which the heav'nly orbs  Moving, with seed or without seed, produce.  Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:  And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows  Th' ideal stamp impress: so that one tree  According to his kind, hath better fruit,  And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,  Are in your talents various.  Were the wax  Molded with nice exactness, and the heav'n  In its disposing influence supreme,  The lustre of the seal should be complete:  But nature renders it imperfect ever,  Resembling thus the artist in her work,  Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.  Howe'er, if love itself dispose, and mark  The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,  There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such  The clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,  That life can teem with; such the burden fill'd  The virgin's bosom: so that I commend  Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er  Was or can be, such as in them it was.    \"Did I advance no further than this point,  'How then had he no peer?'  thou might'st reply.  But, that what now appears not, may appear  Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what  (When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd  To his requesting.  I have spoken thus,  That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd  For wisdom, to the end he might be king  Sufficient: not the number to search out  Of the celestial movers; or to know,  If necessary with contingent e'er  Have made necessity; or whether that  Be granted, that first motion is; or if  Of the mid circle can, by art, be made  Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp.    \"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,  Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,  At which the dart of my intention aims.  And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'  Thou shalt discern it only hath respect  To kings, of whom are many, and the good  Are rare.  With this distinction take my words;  And they may well consist with that which thou  Of the first human father dost believe,  And of our well-beloved.  And let this  Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make  Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,  Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.  For he among the fools is down full low,  Whose affirmation, or denial, is  Without distinction, in each case alike  Since it befalls, that in most instances  Current opinion leads to false: and then  Affection bends the judgment to her ply.    \"Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,  Since he returns not such as he set forth,  Who fishes for the truth"]]]
