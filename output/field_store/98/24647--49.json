But it must always be remembered that untrustworthy as James is in  any thing referring purely to the Americans, he is no worse than  his compeers of both nationalities. The misstatements of Niles in  his \"Weekly Register\" about the British are quite as flagrant, and  his information about his own side even more valuable. [Footnote:  In Niles, by the way, can be found excellent examples of the  traditional American \"spread-eagle\" style. In one place I remember  his describing \"The Immortal Rodgers,\" baulked of his natural prey,  the British, as \"soaring about like the bold bald eagle of his  native land,\" seeking whom he might devour. The accounts he gives of  British line-of-battle ships fleeing from American 44's quite match  James' anecdotes of the latter's avoidance of British 38's and 36's  for fear they might mount twenty-four-pounders. The two works taken  together give a very good idea of the war; separately, either is  utterly unreliable, especially in matters of opinion.] Every little  American author crowed over Perry's \"Nelsonic victory over a greatly  superior force.\" The _Constitution_ was declared to have been at a  disadvantage when she fought the _Guerrière_, and so on _ad  infinitum_. But these writers have all faded into oblivion, and  their writings are not even referred to, much less believed. James,  on the contrary, has passed through edition after edition, is  considered as unquestionable authority in his own country, and  largely throughout Europe, and has furnished the basis for every  subsequent account by British authors. From Alison to Lieutenant  Low, almost every English work, whether of a popular character or  not, is, in so far as it touches on the war, simply a \"rehash\" of  the works written by James. The consequence is that the British  and American accounts have astonishingly little resemblance. One  ascribes the capture of the British frigates simply to the fact  that their opponents were \"cut down line-of-battle ships\"; the  other gives all the glory to the \"undaunted heroism,\" etc., of  the Yankee sailors.    One not very creditable trait of the early American naval historians  gave their rivals a great advantage. The object of the former was  to make out that the _Constitution_, for example, won her victories  against an equal foe, and an exact statement of the forces showed  the contrary; so they always avoided figures, and thus left the  ground clear for James' careful misstatements. Even when they  criticised him they never went into details, confining themselves  to some remark about \"hurling\" his figures in his face with  \"loathing.\" Even Cooper, interesting though his work is, has gone  far less into figures than he should, and seems to have paid little  if any attention to the British official statements, which of  course should be received as of equal weight with the American.  His comments on the actions are generally very fair, the book never  being disfigured by bitterness toward the British; but he is  certainly wrong, for example, in ascribing the loss of the  _Chesapeake_ solely to accident, that of the _Argus_ solely to her  inferiority in force, and so on. His disposition to praise _all_  the American commanders may be generous, but is nevertheless unjust.  If Decatur's surrender of the _President_ is at least impliedly  praised, then Porter's defence of the _Essex_ can hardly receive  its just award. There is no weight in the commendation bestowed  upon Hull, if commendation, the same in kind though less in degree,  is bestowed upon Rodgers. It is a great pity that Cooper did not  write a criticism on James, for no one could have done it more  thoroughly. But he never mentions him, except once in speaking of  Barclay's fleet. In all probability this silence arose from sheer  contempt, and the certainty that most of James' remarks were false;  but the effect was that very many foreigners believe him to have  shirked the subject. He rarely gives any data by which the statements  of James can be disproved, and it is for this reason that I have  been obliged to criticise the latter's work very fully. Many of  James' remarks, however, defy criticism from their random nature,  as when he states that American midshipmen were chiefly masters and  mates of merchantmen, and does not give a single proof to support  the assertion. It would be nearly as true to assert that the  British midshipmen were for the most part ex-members of the  prize-ring, and as much labor would be needed to disprove it. In  other instances it is quite enough to let his words speak for  themselves, as where he says (p. 155) that of the American sailors  one third in number and one half in point of effectiveness were in  reality British. That is, of the 450 men the _Constitution_ had when  she fought the _Java_ 150 were British, and the remaining 300 could  have been as effectively replaced by 150 more British. So a very  little logic works out a result that James certainly did not intend  to arrive at; namely, that 300 British led by American officers  could beat, with ease and comparative impunity, 400 British led by  their own officers. He also forgets that the whole consists of the  sum of the parts. He accounts for the victories of the Americans  by stating (p. 280) that they were lucky enough to meet with frigates  and brigs who had unskilful gunners or worthless crews; he also  carefully shows that the _Macedonian_ was incompetently handled,  the _Peacock_ commanded by a mere martinet, the _Avon's_ crew  unpractised weak and unskilful, the _Java's_ exceedingly poor, and  more to the same effect. Now the Americans took in single fight  three frigates and seven sloops, and when as many as ten vessels  are met it is exceedingly probable that they represent the fair  average; so that James' strictures, so far as true, simply show  that the average British ship was very apt to possess, comparatively  speaking, an incompetent captain or unskilful crew. These  disadvantages were not felt when opposed to navies in which they  existed to an even greater extent, but became very apparent when  brought into contact with a power whose few officers knew how to  play their own parts very nearly to perfection, and, something  equally important, knew how to make first-rate crews out of what  was already good raw material. Finally, a large proportion of  James' abuse of the Americans sufficiently refutes itself, and  perhaps Cooper's method of contemptuously disregarding him was the  best; but no harm can follow from devoting a little space to  commenting upon him.    Much the best American work is Lieutenant George E. Emmons'  statistical \"History of the United States Navy.\" Unfortunately it  is merely a mass of excellently arranged and classified statistics,  and while of invaluable importance to the student, is not interesting  to the average reader. Almost all the statements I have made of  the force, tonnage, and armament of the American vessels, though  I have whenever practicable taken them from the Navy Records, etc.,  yet could be just as well quoted from Emmons. Copies of most of  the American official letters which I have quoted can be found in  \"Niles' Register,\" volumes 1 to 10, and all of the British ones in  the \"London Naval Chronicle\" for the same years. It is to these two  authorities that I am most indebted, and nearly as much so to the  \"American State Papers,\" vol. xiv. Next in order come Emmons,  Cooper, and the invaluable, albeit somewhat scurrilous, James; and  a great many others whose names I have quoted in their proper  places. In commenting upon the actions, I have, whenever possible,  drawn from some standard work, such as Jurien de la Gravière's  \"Guerres Maritimes,\" Lord Howard Douglass' \"Naval Gunnery,\"  or, better still, from the lives and memoirs of Admirals Farragut,  Codrington, Broke, or Durham. The titles of the various works will  be found given in full as they are referred to. [Footnote: To get  an idea of the American seamen of that time Cooper's novels,  \"Miles Wallingford,\" \"Home as Found,\" and the \"Pilot,\" are far  better than any history; in the \"Two Admirals\" the description of  the fleet manoeuvring is unrivalled. His view of Jack's life is  rather rose-colored however. \"Tom Cringle's log\" ought to be read  for the information it gives. Marryatt's novels will show some of  the darker aspects of sailor life.] In a few cases, where extreme  accuracy was necessary, or where, as in the case of the _President's_  capture, it was desirable that there should be no room for dispute  as to the facts, I have given the authority for each sentence; but  in general this would be too cumbersome, and so I have confined  myself to referring, at or near the beginning of the account of  each action, to the authorities from whom I have taken it. For the  less important facts on which every one is agreed I have often given  no references.

'There's blood upon him,' said Barnaby with a shudder. 'It makes me  sick!'    'How came it there?' demanded Varden.    'Steel, steel, steel!' he replied fiercely, imitating with his hand the  thrust of a sword.    'Is he robbed?' said the locksmith.    Barnaby caught him by the arm, and nodded 'Yes;' then pointed towards  the city.    'Oh!' said the old man, bending over the body and looking round as he  spoke into Barnaby's pale face, strangely lighted up by something that  was NOT intellect. 'The robber made off that way, did he? Well, well,  never mind that just now. Hold your torch this way--a little farther  off--so. Now stand quiet, while I try to see what harm is done.'    With these words, he applied himself to a closer examination of  the prostrate form, while Barnaby, holding the torch as he had been  directed, looked on in silence, fascinated by interest or curiosity, but  repelled nevertheless by some strong and secret horror which convulsed  him in every nerve.    As he stood, at that moment, half shrinking back and half bending  forward, both his face and figure were full in the strong glare of the  link, and as distinctly revealed as though it had been broad day. He  was about three-and-twenty years old, and though rather spare, of a fair  height and strong make. His hair, of which he had a great profusion, was  red, and hanging in disorder about his face and shoulders, gave to his  restless looks an expression quite unearthly--enhanced by the paleness  of his complexion, and the glassy lustre of his large protruding eyes.  Startling as his aspect was, the features were good, and there was  something even plaintive in his wan and haggard aspect. But, the absence  of the soul is far more terrible in a living man than in a dead one; and  in this unfortunate being its noblest powers were wanting.    His dress was of green, clumsily trimmed here and there--apparently by  his own hands--with gaudy lace; brightest where the cloth was most  worn and soiled, and poorest where it was at the best. A pair of tawdry  ruffles dangled at his wrists, while his throat was nearly bare. He had  ornamented his hat with a cluster of peacock's feathers, but they were  limp and broken, and now trailed negligently down his back. Girt to his  side was the steel hilt of an old sword without blade or scabbard; and  some particoloured ends of ribands and poor glass toys completed the  ornamental portion of his attire. The fluttered and confused disposition  of all the motley scraps that formed his dress, bespoke, in a scarcely  less degree than his eager and unsettled manner, the disorder of his  mind, and by a grotesque contrast set off and heightened the more  impressive wildness of his face.    'Barnaby,' said the locksmith, after a hasty but careful inspection,  'this man is not dead, but he has a wound in his side, and is in a  fainting-fit.'    'I know him, I know him!' cried Barnaby, clapping his hands.    'Know him?' repeated the locksmith.    'Hush!' said Barnaby, laying his fingers upon his lips. 'He went out  to-day a wooing. I wouldn't for a light guinea that he should never go  a wooing again, for, if he did, some eyes would grow dim that are now as  bright as--see, when I talk of eyes, the stars come out! Whose eyes are  they? If they are angels' eyes, why do they look down here and see good  men hurt, and only wink and sparkle all the night?'    'Now Heaven help this silly fellow,' murmured the perplexed locksmith;  'can he know this gentleman? His mother's house is not far off; I had  better see if she can tell me who he is. Barnaby, my man, help me to put  him in the chaise, and we'll ride home together.'    'I can't touch him!' cried the idiot falling back, and shuddering as  with a strong spasm; 'he's bloody!'    'It's in his nature, I know,' muttered the locksmith, 'it's cruel to ask  him, but I must have help. Barnaby--good Barnaby--dear Barnaby--if you  know this gentleman, for the sake of his life and everybody's life that  loves him, help me to raise him and lay him down.'    'Cover him then, wrap him close--don't let me see it--smell it--hear the  word. Don't speak the word--don't!'    'No, no, I'll not. There, you see he's covered now. Gently. Well done,  well done!'    They placed him in the carriage with great ease, for Barnaby was strong  and active, but all the time they were so occupied he shivered from head  to foot, and evidently experienced an ecstasy of terror.    This accomplished, and the wounded man being covered with Varden's own  greatcoat which he took off for the purpose, they proceeded onward at  a brisk pace: Barnaby gaily counting the stars upon his fingers, and  Gabriel inwardly congratulating himself upon having an adventure now,  which would silence Mrs Varden on the subject of the Maypole, for that  night, or there was no faith in woman.        Chapter 4      In the venerable suburb--it was a suburb once--of Clerkenwell, towards  that part of its confines which is nearest to the Charter House, and in  one of those cool, shady streets, of which a few, widely scattered  and dispersed, yet remain in such old parts of the metropolis,--each  tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient citizen who long ago retired  from business, and dozing on in its infirmity until in course of time it  tumbles down, and is replaced by some extravagant young heir, flaunting  in stucco and ornamental work, and all the vanities of modern days,--in  this quarter, and in a street of this description, the business of the  present chapter lies.    At the time of which it treats, though only six-and-sixty years ago,  a very large part of what is London now had no existence. Even in the  brains of the wildest speculators, there had sprung up no long rows of  streets connecting Highgate with Whitechapel, no assemblages of palaces  in the swampy levels, nor little cities in the open fields. Although  this part of town was then, as now, parcelled out in streets, and  plentifully peopled, it wore a different aspect. There were gardens  to many of the houses, and trees by the pavement side; with an air of  freshness breathing up and down, which in these days would be sought  in vain. Fields were nigh at hand, through which the New River took its  winding course, and where there was merry haymaking in the summer time.  Nature was not so far removed, or hard to get at, as in these days; and  although there were busy trades in Clerkenwell, and working jewellers  by scores, it was a purer place, with farm-houses nearer to it than many  modern Londoners would readily believe, and lovers' walks at no great  distance, which turned into squalid courts, long before the lovers of  this age were born, or, as the phrase goes, thought of.    In one of these streets, the cleanest of them all, and on the shady  side of the way--for good housewives know that sunlight damages their  cherished furniture, and so choose the shade rather than its intrusive  glare--there stood the house with which we have to deal. It was a modest  building, not very straight, not large, not tall; not bold-faced, with  great staring windows, but a shy, blinking house, with a conical roof  going up into a peak over its garret window of four small panes of  glass, like a cocked hat on the head of an elderly gentleman with one  eye. It was not built of brick or lofty stone, but of wood and plaster;  it was not planned with a dull and wearisome regard to regularity,  for no one window matched the other, or seemed to have the slightest  reference to anything besides itself.    The shop--for it had a shop--was, with reference to the first floor,  where shops usually are; and there all resemblance between it and any  other shop stopped short and ceased. People who went in and out didn't  go up a flight of steps to it, or walk easily in upon a level with the  street, but dived down three steep stairs, as into a cellar. Its floor  was paved with stone and brick, as that of any other cellar might be;  and in lieu of window framed and glazed it had a great black wooden flap  or shutter, nearly breast high from the ground, which turned back in  the day-time, admitting as much cold air as light, and very often more.  Behind this shop was a wainscoted parlour, looking first into a paved  yard, and beyond that again into a little terrace garden, raised some  feet above it. Any stranger would have supposed that this wainscoted  parlour, saving for the door of communication by which he had entered,  was cut off and detached from all the world; and indeed most strangers  on their first entrance were observed to grow extremely thoughtful, as  weighing and pondering in their minds whether the upper rooms were only  approachable by ladders from without; never suspecting that two of  the most unassuming and unlikely doors in existence, which the most  ingenious mechanician on earth must of necessity have supposed to be  the doors of closets, opened out of this room--each without the smallest  preparation, or so much as a quarter of an inch of passage--upon two  dark winding flights of stairs, the one upward, the other downward,  which were the sole means of communication between that chamber and the  other portions of the house.    With all these oddities, there was not a neater, more scrupulously tidy,  or more punctiliously ordered house, in Clerkenwell, in London, in all  England. There were not cleaner windows, or whiter floors, or brighter  Stoves, or more highly shining articles of furniture in old mahogany;  there was not more rubbing, scrubbing, burnishing and polishing, in the  whole street put together. Nor was this excellence attained without some  cost and trouble and great expenditure of voice, as the neighbours  were frequently reminded when the good lady of the house overlooked and  assisted in its being put "]]]
