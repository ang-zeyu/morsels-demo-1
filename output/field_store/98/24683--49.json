Toward sunset,  however, the storm ceased as suddenly as it began. A bright streak  of clear red sky appeared above the western verge of the prairie, the  horizontal rays of the sinking sun streamed through it and glittered in  a thousand prismatic colors upon the dripping groves and the prostrate  grass. The pools in the tent dwindled and sunk into the saturated soil.    But all our hopes were delusive. Scarcely had night set in, when the  tumult broke forth anew. The thunder here is not like the tame thunder  of the Atlantic coast. Bursting with a terrific crash directly above our  heads, it roared over the boundless waste of prairie, seeming to roll  around the whole circle of the firmament with a peculiar and awful  reverberation. The lightning flashed all night, playing with its livid  glare upon the neighboring trees, revealing the vast expanse of the  plain, and then leaving us shut in as by a palpable wall of darkness.    It did not disturb us much. Now and then a peal awakened us, and made us  conscious of the electric battle that was raging, and of the floods that  dashed upon the stanch canvas over our heads. We lay upon india-rubber  cloths, placed between our blankets and the soil. For a while they  excluded the water to admiration; but when at length it accumulated and  began to run over the edges, they served equally well to retain it, so  that toward the end of the night we were unconsciously reposing in small  pools of rain.    On finally awaking in the morning the prospect was not a cheerful one.  The rain no longer poured in torrents; but it pattered with a quiet  pertinacity upon the strained and saturated canvas. We disengaged  ourselves from our blankets, every fiber of which glistened with little  beadlike drops of water, and looked out in vain hope of discovering some  token of fair weather. The clouds, in lead-colored volumes, rested upon  the dismal verge of the prairie, or hung sluggishly overhead, while the  earth wore an aspect no more attractive than the heavens, exhibiting  nothing but pools of water, grass beaten down, and mud well trampled by  our mules and horses. Our companions' tent, with an air of forlorn  and passive misery, and their wagons in like manner, drenched and  woe-begone, stood not far off. The captain was just returning from his  morning's inspection of the horses. He stalked through the mist and  rain, with his plaid around his shoulders; his little pipe, dingy as an  antiquarian relic, projecting from beneath his mustache, and his brother  Jack at his heels.    \"Good-morning, captain.\"    \"Good-morning to your honors,\" said the captain, affecting the Hibernian  accent; but at that instant, as he stooped to enter the tent, he tripped  upon the cords at the entrance, and pitched forward against the guns  which were strapped around the pole in the center.    \"You are nice men, you are!\" said he, after an ejaculation not necessary  to be recorded, \"to set a man-trap before your door every morning to  catch your visitors.\"    Then he sat down upon Henry Chatillon's saddle. We tossed a piece of  buffalo robe to Jack, who was looking about in some embarrassment. He  spread it on the ground, and took his seat, with a stolid countenance,  at his brother's side.    \"Exhilarating weather, captain!\"    \"Oh, delightful, delightful!\" replied the captain. \"I knew it would be  so; so much for starting yesterday at noon! I knew how it would turn  out; and I said so at the time.\"    \"You said just the contrary to us. We were in no hurry, and only moved  because you insisted on it.\"    \"Gentlemen,\" said the captain, taking his pipe from his mouth with an  air of extreme gravity, \"it was no plan of mine. There is a man among us  who is determined to have everything his own way. You may express your  opinion; but don't expect him to listen. You may be as reasonable as  you like: oh, it all goes for nothing! That man is resolved to rule the  roost and he'll set his face against any plan that he didn't think of  himself.\"    The captain puffed for a while at his pipe, as if meditating upon his  grievances; then he began again:    \"For twenty years I have been in the British army; and in all that time  I never had half so much dissension, and quarreling, and nonsense, as  since I have been on this cursed prairie. He's the most uncomfortable  man I ever met.\"    \"Yes,\" said Jack; \"and don't you know, Bill, how he drank up all the  coffee last night, and put the rest by for himself till the morning!\"    \"He pretends to know everything,\" resumed the captain; \"nobody must give  orders but he! It's, oh! we must do this; and, oh! we must do that; and  the tent must be pitched here, and the horses must be picketed there;  for nobody knows as well as he does.\"    We were a little surprised at this disclosure of domestic dissensions  among our allies, for though we knew of their existence, we were not  aware of their extent. The persecuted captain seeming wholly at a loss  as to the course of conduct that he should pursue, we recommended him to  adopt prompt and energetic measures; but all his military experience  had failed to teach him the indispensable lesson to be \"hard,\" when the  emergency requires it.    \"For twenty years,\" he repeated, \"I have been in the British army, and  in that time I have been intimately acquainted with some two hundred  officers, young and old, and I never yet quarreled with any man. Oh,  'anything for a quiet life!' that's my maxim.\"    We intimated that the prairie was hardly the place to enjoy a quiet  life, but that, in the present circumstances, the best thing he could  do toward securing his wished-for tranquillity, was immediately to put  a period to the nuisance that disturbed it. But again the captain's  easy good-nature recoiled from the task. The somewhat vigorous measures  necessary to gain the desired result were utterly repugnant to him; he  preferred to pocket his grievances, still retaining the privilege of  grumbling about them. \"Oh, anything for a quiet life!\" he said again,  circling back to his favorite maxim.    But to glance at the previous history of our transatlantic confederates.  The captain had sold his commission, and was living in bachelor ease  and dignity in his paternal halls, near Dublin. He hunted, fished, rode  steeple-chases, ran races, and talked of his former exploits. He  was surrounded with the trophies of his rod and gun; the walls were  plentifully garnished, he told us, with moose-horns and deer-horns,  bear-skins, and fox-tails; for the captain's double-barreled rifle had  seen service in Canada and Jamaica; he had killed salmon in Nova Scotia,  and trout, by his own account, in all the streams of the three kingdoms.  But in an evil hour a seductive stranger came from London; no less a  person than R., who, among other multitudinous wanderings, had once been  upon the western prairies, and naturally enough was anxious to visit  them again. The captain's imagination was inflamed by the pictures of a  hunter's paradise that his guest held forth; he conceived an ambition  to add to his other trophies the horns of a buffalo, and the claws of  a grizzly bear; so he and R. struck a league to travel in company. Jack  followed his brother, as a matter of course. Two weeks on board the  Atlantic steamer brought them to Boston; in two weeks more of hard  traveling they reached St. Louis, from which a ride of six days  carried them to the frontier; and here we found them, in full tide of  preparation for their journey.    We had been throughout on terms of intimacy with the captain, but  R., the motive power of our companions' branch of the expedition, was  scarcely known to us. His voice, indeed, might be heard incessantly; but  at camp he remained chiefly within the tent, and on the road he either  rode by himself, or else remained in close conversation with his friend  Wright, the muleteer. As the captain left the tent that morning, I  observed R. standing by the fire, and having nothing else to do, I  determined to ascertain, if possible, what manner of man he was. He had  a book under his arm, but just at present he was engrossed in actively  superintending the operations of Sorel, the hunter, who was cooking some  corn-bread over the coals for breakfast. R. was a well-formed and rather  good-looking man, some thirty years old; considerably younger than the  captain. He wore a beard and mustache of the oakum complexion, and  his attire was altogether more elegant than one ordinarily sees on the  prairie. He wore his cap on one side of his head; his checked shirt,  open in front, was in very neat order, considering the circumstances,  and his blue pantaloons, of the John Bull cut, might once have figured  in Bond Street.    \"Turn over that cake, man! turn it over, quick! Don't you see it  burning?\"    \"It ain't half done,\" growled Sorel, in the amiable tone of a whipped  bull-dog.    \"It is. Turn it over, I tell you!\"    Sorel, a strong, sullen-looking Canadian, who from having spent his life  among the wildest and most remote of the Indian tribes, had imbibed much  of their dark, vindictive spirit, looked ferociously up, as if he longed  to leap upon his bourgeois and throttle him; but he obeyed the order,  coming from so experienced an artist.    \"It was a good idea of yours,\" said I, seating myself on the tongue of a  wagon, \"to bring Indian meal with you.\"    \"Yes, yes\" said R. \"It's good bread for the prairie--good bread for the  prairie. I tell you that's burning again.\"    Here he stooped down, and unsheathing the silver-mounted hunting-knife  in his belt, began to perform the part of cook himself; at the same  time requesting me to hold for a moment the book under his arm, which  interfered with the exercise of these important functions. I opened  it; it was \"Macaulay's Lays\"; and I made some remark,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10163"],[0,"Mohammedanism (#9)"],[1,"tion.  The ritual, only provisionally regulated and continually liable to change  according to prophetic inspiration in Mohammed's lifetime, required  unalterable rules after his death. Recent studies[1] have shown in an  astounding way, that the Jewish ritual, together with the religious rites  of the Christians, strongly influenced the definite shape given to that of  Islam, while indirect influence of the Parsi religion is at least probable.    [Footnote 1: The studies of Professors C.H. Becker, E. Mittwoch, and  A.J. Wensinck, especially taken in connection with older ones of Ignaz  Goldziher, have thrown much light upon this subject.]    So much for the rites of public worship and the ritual purity they require.  The method of fasting seems to follow the Jewish model, whereas the period  of obligatory fasting depends on the Christian usage.    Mohammed's fragmentary and unsystematic accounts of sacred history were  freely drawn from Jewish and Christian sources and covered the whole period  from the creation of the world until the first centuries of the Christian  era. Of course, features shocking to the Moslim mind were dropped and the  whole adapted to the monotonous conception of the Qoran. With ever greater  boldness the story of Mohammed's own life was exalted to the sphere of  the supernatural; here the Gospel served as example. Though Mohammed had  repeatedly declared himself to be an ordinary man chosen by Allah as the  organ of His revelation, and whose only miracle was the Qoran, posterity  ascribed to him a whole series of wonders, evidently invented in emulation  of the wonders of Christ. The reason for this seems to have been the idea  that none of the older prophets, not even Jesus, of whom the Qoran tells  the greatest wonders, could have worked a miracle without Mohammed, the  Seal of the prophets, having rivalled or surpassed him in this respect.  Only Jesus was the Messiah; but this title did not exceed in value  different titles of other prophets, and Mohammed's special epithets were  of a higher order. A relative sinlessness Mohammed shared with Jesus; the  acceptance of this doctrine, contradictory to the original spirit of the  Qoran, had moreover a dogmatic motive: it was considered indispensable  to raise the text of the Qoran above all suspicion of corruption, which  suspicion would not be excluded if the organ of the Revelation were  fallible.    This period of naively adopting institutions, doctrines, and traditions was  soon followed by an awakening to the consciousness that Islam could not  well absorb any more of such foreign elements without endangering its  independent character. Then a sorting began; and the assimilation of the  vast amount of borrowed matter, that had already become an integral part of  Islam, was completed by submitting the whole to a peculiar treatment. It  was carefully divested of all marks of origin and labelled _hadith_,[1]  so that henceforth it was regarded as emanations from the wisdom of the  Arabian Prophet, for which his followers owed no thanks to foreigners.    [Footnote 1: _Hadith_, the Arabic word for record, story, has assumed  the technical meaning of \"tradition\" concerning the words and deeds of  Mohammed. It is used as well in the sense of a single record of this sort  as in that of the whole body of sacred traditions.]    At first, it was only at Medina that some pious people occupied themselves  with registering, putting in order, and systematizing the spiritual  property of Islam; afterwards similar circles were formed in other centres,  such as Mecca, Kufa, Basra, Misr (Cairo), and elsewhere. At the outset  the collection of divine sayings, the Qoran, was the only guide, the only  source of decisive decrees, the only touchstone of what was true or false,  allowed or forbidden. Reluctantly, but decidedly at last, it was conceded  that the foundations laid by Mohammed for the life of his community were  by no means all to be found in the Holy Book; rather, that Mohammed's  revelations without his explanation and practice would have remained an  enigma. It was understood now that the rules and laws of Islam were founded  on God's word and on the Sunnah, _i.e._, the \"way\" pointed out by the  Prophet's word and example. Thus it had been from the moment that Allah had  caused His light to shine over Arabia, and thus it must remain, if human  error was not to corrupt Islam.    At the moment when this conservative instinct began to assert itself among  the spiritual leaders, so much foreign matter had already been incorporated  into Islam, that the theory of the sufficiency of Qoran and Sunnah could  not have been maintained without the labelling operation which we have  alluded to. So it was assumed that as surely as Mohammed must have  surpassed his predecessors in perfection and in wonders, so surely must  all the principles and precepts necessary for his community have been  formulated by him. Thus, by a gigantic web of fiction, he became after his  death the organ of opinions, ideas, and interests, whose lawfulness was  recognized by every influential section of the Faithful. All that could not  be identified as part of the Prophet's Sunnah, received no recognition; on  the other hand, all that was accepted had, somehow, to be incorporated into  the Sunnah.    It became a fundamental dogma of Islam, that the Sunnah was the  indispensable completion of the Qoran, and that both together formed the  source of Mohammedan law and doctrine; so much so that every party assumed  the name of \"People of the Sunnah\" to express its pretension to orthodoxy.  The _contents_ of the Sunnah, however, was the subject of a great deal of  controversy; so that it came to be considered necessary to make the Prophet  pronounce his authoritative judgment on this difference of opinion. He  was said to have called it a proof of God's special mercy, that within  reasonable limits difference of opinion was allowed in his community. Of  that privilege Mohammedans have always amply availed themselves.    When the difference touched on political questions, especially on the  succession of the Prophet in the government of the community, schism was  the inevitable consequence. Thus arose the party strifes of the first  century, which led to the establishment of the sects of the Shi'ites and  the Kharijites, separate communities, severed from the great whole, that  led their own lives, and therefore followed paths different from those of  the majority in matters of doctrine and law as well as in politics. The  sharpness of the political antithesis served to accentuate the importance  of the other differences in such cases and to debar their acceptance as the  legal consequence of the difference of opinion that God's mercy allowed.  That the political factor was indeed the great motive of separation, is  clearly shown in our own day, now that one Mohammedan state after the other  sees its political independence disappearing and efforts are being made  from all sides to re-establish the unity of the Mohammedan world by  stimulating the feeling of religious brotherhood. Among the most cultivated  Moslims of different countries an earnest endeavour is gaining ground to  admit Shi'ites, Kharijites, and others, formerly abused as heretics, into  the great community, now threatened by common foes, and to regard their  special tenets in the same way as the differences existing between the four  law schools: Hanafites, Malikites, Shafi'ites and Hanbalites, which for  centuries have been considered equally orthodox.    Although the differences that divide these schools at first caused great  excitement and gave rise to violent discussions, the strong catholic  instinct of Islam always knew how to prevent schism. Each new generation  either found the golden mean between the extremes which had divided the  preceding one, or it recognized the right of both opinions.    Though the dogmatic differences were not necessarily so dangerous to  unity as were political ones, yet they were more apt to cause schism than  discussions about the law. It was essential to put an end to dissension  concerning the theological roots of the whole system of Islam. Mohammed had  never expressed any truth in dogmatic form; all systematic thinking was  foreign to his nature. It was again the non-Arabic Moslims, especially  those of Christian origin, who suggested such doctrinal questions. At first  they met with a vehement opposition that condemned all dogmatic discussion  as a novelty of the Devil. In the long run, however, the contest of the  conservatives against specially objectionable features of the dogmatists'  discussions forced them to borrow arms from the dogmatic arsenal. Hence a  method with a peculiar terminology came in vogue, to which even the boldest  imagination could not ascribe any connection with the Sunnah of Mohammed.  Yet some traditions ventured to put prophetic warnings on Mohammed's lips  against dogmatic innovations that were sure to arise, and to make him  pronounce the names of a couple of future sects. But no one dared to make  the Prophet preach an orthodox system of dogmatics resulting from the  controversies of several centuries, all the terms of which were foreign to  the Arabic speech of Mohammed's time.    Indeed, all the subjects which had given rise to dogmatic controversy  in the Christian Church, except some too specifically Christian, were  discussed by the _mutakallims_, the dogmatists of Islam. Free will or  predestination; God omnipotent, or first of all just and holy; God's word  created by Him, or sharing His eternity; God one in this sense, that His  being admitted of no plurality of qualities, or possessed of qualities,  which in all eternity are inherent in His being; in the world to come only  bliss and doom, or also an intermediate state for the neutral.
