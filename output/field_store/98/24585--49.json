At the end of that period, however, he returned to  his subject.    \"After the serious business of the meal was concluded, and a simple  hymn had been sung by those present,\" he said, \"Mr. Clowes resumed his  very interesting remarks. We were on the subject of brothers at  school. Now, take the melancholy case of Jackson Brothers. My heart  bleeds for Bob.\"    \"Jackson's all right. What's wrong with him? Besides, naturally, young  Jackson came to Wrykyn when all his brothers had been here.\"    \"What a rotten argument. It's just the one used by chaps' people, too.  They think how nice it will be for all the sons to have been at the  same school. It may be all right after they're left, but while they're  there, it's the limit. You say Jackson's all right. At present,  perhaps, he is. But the term's hardly started yet.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Look here, what's at the bottom of this sending young brothers to the  same school as elder brothers?\"    \"Elder brother can keep an eye on him, I suppose.\"    \"That's just it. For once in your life you've touched the spot. In  other words, Bob Jackson is practically responsible for the kid.  That's where the whole rotten trouble starts.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Well, what happens? He either lets the kid rip, in which case he may  find himself any morning in the pleasant position of having to explain  to his people exactly why it is that little Willie has just received  the boot, and why he didn't look after him better: or he spends all  his spare time shadowing him to see that he doesn't get into trouble.  He feels that his reputation hangs on the kid's conduct, so he broods  over him like a policeman, which is pretty rotten for him and maddens  the kid, who looks on him as no sportsman. Bob seems to be trying the  first way, which is what I should do myself. It's all right, so far,  but, as I said, the term's only just started.\"    \"Young Jackson seems all right. What's wrong with him? He doesn't  stick on side any way, which he might easily do, considering his  cricket.\"    \"There's nothing wrong with him in that way. I've talked to him  several times at the nets, and he's very decent. But his getting into  trouble hasn't anything to do with us. It's the masters you've got to  consider.\"    \"What's up? Does he rag?\"    \"From what I gather from fellows in his form he's got a genius for  ragging. Thinks of things that don't occur to anybody else, and does  them, too.\"    \"He never seems to be in extra. One always sees him about on  half-holidays.\"    \"That's always the way with that sort of chap. He keeps on wriggling  out of small rows till he thinks he can do anything he likes without  being dropped on, and then all of a sudden he finds himself up to the  eyebrows in a record smash. I don't say young Jackson will land  himself like that. All I say is that he's just the sort who does. He's  asking for trouble. Besides, who do you see him about with all the  time?\"    \"He's generally with Wyatt when I meet him.\"    \"Yes. Well, then!\"    \"What's wrong with Wyatt? He's one of the decentest men in the  school.\"    \"I know. But he's working up for a tremendous row one of these days,  unless he leaves before it comes off. The odds are, if Jackson's so  thick with him, that he'll be roped into it too. Wyatt wouldn't land  him if he could help it, but he probably wouldn't realise what he was  letting the kid in for. For instance, I happen to know that Wyatt  breaks out of his dorm. every other night. I don't know if he takes  Jackson with him. I shouldn't think so. But there's nothing to prevent  Jackson following him on his own. And if you're caught at that game,  it's the boot every time.\"    Trevor looked disturbed.    \"Somebody ought to speak to Bob.\"    \"What's the good? Why worry him? Bob couldn't do anything. You'd only  make him do the policeman business, which he hasn't time for, and  which is bound to make rows between them. Better leave him alone.\"    \"I don't know. It would be a beastly thing for Bob if the kid did get  into a really bad row.\"    \"If you must tell anybody, tell the Gazeka. He's head of Wain's, and  has got far more chance of keeping an eye on Jackson than Bob has.\"    \"The Gazeka is a fool.\"    \"All front teeth and side. Still, he's on the spot. But what's the  good of worrying. It's nothing to do with us, anyhow. Let's stagger  out, shall we?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Trevor's conscientious nature, however, made it impossible for him to  drop the matter. It disturbed him all the time that he and Clowes were  on the river; and, walking back to the house, he resolved to see Bob  about it during preparation.    He found him in his study, oiling a bat.    \"I say, Bob,\" he said, \"look here. Are you busy?\"    \"No. Why?\"    \"It's this way. Clowes and I were talking----\"    \"If Clowes was there he was probably talking. Well?\"    \"About your brother.\"    \"Oh, by Jove,\" said Bob, sitting up. \"That reminds me. I forgot to get  the evening paper. Did he get his century all right?\"    \"Who?\" asked Trevor, bewildered.    \"My brother, J. W. He'd made sixty-three not out against Kent in this  morning's paper. What happened?\"    \"I didn't get a paper either. I didn't mean that brother. I meant the  one here.\"    \"Oh, Mike? What's Mike been up to?\"    \"Nothing as yet, that I know of; but, I say, you know, he seems a  great pal of Wyatt's.\"    \"I know. I spoke to him about it.\"    \"Oh, you did? That's all right, then.\"    \"Not that there's anything wrong with Wyatt.\"    \"Not a bit. Only he is rather mucking about this term, I hear. It's  his last, so I suppose he wants to have a rag.\"    \"Don't blame him.\"    \"Nor do I. Rather rot, though, if he lugged your brother into a row by  accident.\"    \"I should get blamed. I think I'll speak to him again.\"    \"I should, I think.\"    \"I hope he isn't idiot enough to go out at night with Wyatt. If Wyatt  likes to risk it, all right. That's his look out. But it won't do for  Mike to go playing the goat too.\"    \"Clowes suggested putting Firby-Smith on to him. He'd have more  chance, being in the same house, of seeing that he didn't come a  mucker than you would.\"    \"I've done that. Smith said he'd speak to him.\"    \"That's all right then. Is that a new bat?\"    \"Got it to-day. Smashed my other yesterday--against the school house.\"    Donaldson's had played a friendly with the school house during the  last two days, and had beaten them.    \"I thought I heard it go. You were rather in form.\"    \"Better than at the beginning of the term, anyhow. I simply couldn't  do a thing then. But my last three innings have been 33 not out, 18,  and 51.    \"I should think you're bound to get your first all right.\"    \"Hope so. I see Mike's playing for the second against the O.W.s.\"    \"Yes. Pretty good for his first term. You have a pro. to coach you in  the holidays, don't you?\"    \"Yes. I didn't go to him much this last time. I was away a lot. But  Mike fairly lived inside the net.\"    \"Well, it's not been chucked away. I suppose he'll get his first next  year. There'll be a big clearing-out of colours at the end of this  term. Nearly all the first are leaving. Henfrey'll be captain, I  expect.\"    \"Saunders, the pro. at home, always says that Mike's going to be the  star cricketer of the family. Better than J. W. even, he thinks. I  asked him what he thought of me, and he said, 'You'll be making a lot  of runs some day, Mr. Bob.' There's a subtle difference, isn't there?  I shall have Mike cutting me out before I leave school if I'm not  careful.\"    \"Sort of infant prodigy,\" said Trevor. \"Don't think he's quite up to  it yet, though.\"    He went back to his study, and Bob, having finished his oiling and  washed his hands, started on his Thucydides. And, in the stress of  wrestling with the speech of an apparently delirious Athenian general,  whose remarks seemed to contain nothing even remotely resembling sense  and coherence, he allowed the question of Mike's welfare to fade from  his mind like a dissolving view.          CHAPTER VIII    A ROW WITH THE TOWN      The beginning of a big row, one of those rows which turn a school  upside down like a volcanic eruption and provide old boys with  something to talk about, when they meet, for years, is not unlike the  beginning of a thunderstorm.    You are walking along one seemingly fine day, when suddenly there is a  hush, and there falls on you from space one big drop. The next moment  the thing has begun, and you are standing in a shower-bath. It is just  the same with a row. Some trivial episode occurs, and in an instant  the place is in a ferment. It was so with the great picnic at Wrykyn.    The bare outlines of the beginning of this affair are included in a  letter which Mike wrote to his father on the Sunday following the Old  Wrykynian matches.    This was the letter:       \"DEAR FATHER,--Thanks awfully for your letter. I hope you are quite     well. I have been getting on all right at cricket lately. My scores     since I wrote last have been 0 in a scratch game (the sun got in my     eyes just as I played, and I got bowled); 15 for the third against an     eleven of masters (without G. B. Jones, the Surrey man, and Spence);     28 not out in the Under Sixteen game; and 30 in a form match. Rather     decent. Yesterday one of the men put down for the second against the     O.W.'s second couldn't play because his father was very ill, so I     played. Wasn't it luck? It's the first time I've played for the     second. I didn't do much, because I didn't get an innings. They stop     the cricket on O.W. matches day because they have a lot of rotten     Greek plays and things which take up a frightful time, and half the     chaps are acting, so we stop from lunch to four. Rot I call it. So I     didn't go in, because they won the toss and made 215, and by the time     we'd made 140 for 6 it was close of play. They'd stuck me in eighth     wicket. Rather rot.

But he wasn't sorry. Oh, dear, no! for in  half an hour he had picked every one of the sweet peas Aunt Jane was so  fond of, thrown all the tomatoes over the fence, and let the parrot out  of his cage. The sight of Polly walking into the parlor with a polite  \"How are you, ma'am?\" sent Aunt Jane to see what was going on. Neddy was  fast asleep in the hammock, worn out with his cares; and Jocko, having  unhooked his chain, was sitting on the chimney-top of a neighbor's  house, eating corn.    \"We shall not live to the end of the week if this sort of thing goes  on. I don't know what to do with the little beast; he's as bad as an  elephant to take care of,\" said the poor lady, in despair, as she saw  Jocko throw his corncob down on the minister's hat as that stately  gentleman went by.    As none of them could catch him, Miss Jane let him alone till Neddy  waked up and could go and find some of the big boys to help him.    Jocko soon left the roof, and skipped in at a window that stood open. It  was little Nelly Brown's play-room, and she had left her pet doll Maud  Mabel Rose Matilda very ill in the best bed, while she went down to get  a poppy leaf to rub the darling's cheeks with, because she had a high  fever. Jocko took a fancy to the pretty bed, and after turning the  play-house topsy-turvy, he pulled poor Maud Mabel Rose Matilda out by  her flaxen hair, and stuffing her into the water-pitcher upside  down, got into the bed, drew the lace curtains, and prepared to doze  deliciously under the pink silk bed-cover.    Up came Nelly, and went at once to the dear invalid, saying in her  motherly little voice,--    \"Now, my darling child, lie quite still, and I won't hurt you one bit.\"    But when she drew the curtain, instead of the lovely yellow-haired doll  in her ruffled nightcap, she saw an ugly little black face staring at  her, and a tiny hand holding the sheet fast. Nelly gave one scream, and  flew downstairs into the parlor where the Sewing-circle was at work,  frightening twenty-five excellent ladies by her cries, as she clung to  her mother, wailing,--    \"A bogie! a bogie! I saw him, all black; and he snarled at me, and my  dolly is gone! What shall I do? oh, what shall I do?\"    There was great confusion, for all the ladies talked at once; and it  so happened that none of them knew anything about the monkey, therefore  they all agreed that Nelly was a foolish child, and had made a fuss  about nothing. She cried dismally, and kept saying to her mother,--    \"Go and see; it's in my dolly's bed,--I found it there, and darling  Maudie is gone.\"    \"We _will_ go and see,\" said Mrs. Moses Merryweather,--a stout old lady,  who kept her six girls in such good order that _they_ would never have  dared to cry if ten monkeys had popped out at them.    Miss Hetty Bumpus, a tall thin maiden lady, with a sharp eye and pointed  nose, went with her; but at the door that led to the dining-room  both stopped short, and after one look came flying back, calling out  together,--    \"Mrs. Brown, your supper is spoilt! a dreadful beast has ruined it all!\"    Then twenty-five excited ladies flew across the hall to behold Jocko  sitting on the great cake in the middle of the table, his feet bathed  in cream from the overturned pitcher, while all around lay the ruins of  custards, tarts, biscuits, and sauce, not to mention nice napkins made  into hay-cocks, spoons, knives, and forks, on the floor, and the best  silver teapot in the fireplace.    While Nelly told her tale and the ladies questioned and comforted her,  this bad monkey had skipped downstairs and had a delightful party all  by himself. He was just scraping the jelly out of a tart when they  disturbed him; and knowing that more slaps were in store for him if he  stayed, he at once walked calmly down the ravaged table, and vanished  out of the window carrying the silver tea-strainer with him to play  with.    The ladies had no supper that night; and poor Mrs. Brown sent a note to  Aunt Jane, telling her the sad story, and adding that Nelly was quite  ill with the fright and the loss of dear Maud Mabel Rose Matilda,  drowned in the water-pitcher and forever spoilt.    \"John shall go after that man to-morrow, and bring him back to carry  this terrible monkey away. I can't live with him a week; he will cost me  a fortune, and wear us all out,\" said Aunt Jane, when Jocko was safely  shut up in the cellar, after six boys had chased him all over the  neighborhood before they caught him.    Neddy was quite willing to let him go; but John was saved his journey,  for in the morning poor Jocko was found dead in a trap, where his  inquisitive head had been poked to see what the cheese tasted like.    So he was buried by the river, and every one felt much relieved; for the  man never came back, thinking Jocko dead when he left him. But he  had not lived in vain; for after this day of trial, mischievous Neddy  behaved much better, and Aunt Jane could always calm his prankish spirit  by saying, as her finger pointed to a little collar and chain hanging on  the wall,--    \"If you want to act like naughty Jocko, say so, and I'll tie you up. One  monkey is enough for this family.\"      [Illustration: Kitty laughed, and began to dance.... Such twirlings and  skippings as she made.]          IV.    THE SKIPPING SHOES.      Once there was a little girl, named Kitty, who never wanted to do what  people asked her. She said \"I won't\" and \"I can't,\" and did not run at  once pleasantly, as obliging children do.    One day her mother gave her a pair of new shoes; and after a fuss about  putting them on, Kitty said, as she lay kicking on the floor,--    \"I wish these were seven-leagued boots, like Jack the Giant Killer's,  then it would be easy to run errands all the time. Now, I hate to keep  trotting, and I don't like new shoes, and I won't stir a step.\"    Just as she said that, the shoes gave a skip, and set her on her feet  so suddenly that it scared all the naughtiness out of her. She stood  looking at these curious shoes; and the bright buttons on them seemed  to wink at her like eyes, while the heels tapped on the floor a sort of  tune. Before she dared to stir, her mother called from the next room,--    \"Kitty, run and tell the cook to make a pie for dinner; I forgot it.\"    \"I don't want to,\" began Kitty, with a whine as usual.    But the words were hardly out of her mouth when the shoes gave one jump,  and took her downstairs, through the hall, and landed her at the kitchen  door. Her breath was nearly gone; but she gave the message, and turned  round, trying to see if the shoes would let her walk at all. They went  nicely till she wanted to turn into the china-closet where the cake was.  She was forbidden to touch it, but loved to take a bit when she could.  Now she found that her feet were fixed fast to the floor, and could not  be moved till her father said, as he passed the window close by,--    \"You will have time to go to the post-office before school and get my  letters.\"    \"I can't,\" began Kitty; but she found she could, for away went the  shoes, out of the house at one bound, and trotted down the street so  fast that the maid who ran after her with her hat could not catch her.    \"I can't stop!\" cried Kitty; and she did not till the shoes took her  straight into the office.    \"What's the hurry to-day?\" asked the man, as he saw her without any hat,  all rosy and breathless, and her face puckered up as if she did not know  whether to laugh or to cry.    \"I won't tell any one about these dreadful shoes, and I'll take them off  as soon as I get home. I hope they will go back slowly, or people will  think I'm crazy,\" said Kitty to herself, as she took the letters and  went away.    The shoes walked nicely along till she came to the bridge; and there she  wanted to stop and watch some boys in a boat, forgetting school and her  father's letters. But the shoes wouldn't stop, though she tried to make  them, and held on to the railing as hard as she could. Her feet went on;  and when she sat down they still dragged her along so steadily that she  had to go, and she got up feeling that there was something very strange  about these shoes. The minute she gave up, all went smoothly, and she  got home in good time.    \"I won't wear these horrid things another minute,\" said Kitty, sitting  on the doorstep and trying to unbutton the shoes.    But not a button could she stir, though she got red and angry struggling  to do it.    \"Time for school; run away, little girl,\" called mamma from upstairs, as  the clock struck nine.    \"I won't!\" said Kitty, crossly.    But she did; for those magic shoes danced her off, and landed her at her  desk in five minutes.    \"Well, I'm not late; that's one comfort,\" she thought, wishing she had  come pleasantly, and not been whisked away without any luncheon.    Her legs were so tired with the long skips that she was glad to sit  still; and that pleased the teacher, for generally she was fussing about  all lesson time. But at recess she got into trouble again; for one of  the children knocked down the house of corn-cobs she had built, and made  her angry.    \"Now, I'll kick yours down, and see how you like it, Dolly.\"    Up went her foot, but it didn't come down; it stayed in the air, and  there she stood looking as if she were going to dance. The children  laughed to see her, and she could do nothing till she said to Dolly in a  great hurry,--    \"Never mind; if you didn't mean to, I'll forgive you.\"    Then the foot went down, and Kitty felt so glad about it that she tried  to be pleasant, fearing some new caper of those dreadful shoes. She  began to see how they worked, and thought she would try if she had any  power over them. So, when one of the children wanted his ball, which had  bounced over the hedge, she said"]]]
