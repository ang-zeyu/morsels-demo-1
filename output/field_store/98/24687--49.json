[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10338"],[0,"With the Turks in Palestine (#9)"],[1,"Orient is equivalent to saying  they were respected. The Beirut people are famous for their fighting  spirit, but this spirit was not manifested after a few weeks of intimate  acquaintance with the American blue-jackets.    My inspection of the devastation caused by the locusts completed, I  returned home. The news that greeted me there was alarming. I must  narrate with some detail the events which finally decided me to leave  the country. About one hour's ride on horseback from our village lives a  family of Turkish nobles, the head of which was Sadik Pasha, brother of  the famous Kiamil Pasha, several times Grand Vizier of the Empire.  Sadik, who had been exiled from Constantinople, came to Palestine and  bought great tracts of land near my people. After his death his  sons--good-for-nothing, wild fellows--were forced to sell most of the  estate--all except one Fewzi Bey, who retained his part of the land and  lived on it. Here he collected a band of friends as worthless as himself  and gradually commenced a career of plundering and \"frightfulness\" much  like that of the robber barons of mediaeval Germany. Before the  outbreak of the war he confined his attentions chiefly to the Arabs,  whom he treated shamefully. He raided cattle and crops and carried off  girls and women in broad daylight. On one occasion he stopped a wedding  procession and carried off the young bride. Then he seized the  bridegroom, against whom he bore a grudge, and subjected the poor  Bedouin to the bastinado until he consented to divorce his wife by  pronouncing the words, \"I divorce thee,\" three times in the presence of  witnesses, according to Mohammedan custom. This Bedouin was the grandson  of the Sheikh Hilou, a holy man of the region upon whose grave the Arabs  are accustomed to make their prayers. But we villagers of Zicron-Jacob  had never submitted to Fewzi Bey in any way; our young men were  organized and armed, and after a few encounters he let us alone.    After the mobilization, however, and the taking away of our arms, this  outlaw saw that his chance had come. He began to send his men and his  camels into our fields to harvest our crops and carry them off. This  pillage continued until the locusts came--Fewzi, in the mean while,  becoming so bold that he would gallop through the streets of our village  with his horsemen, shooting right and left into the air and insulting  old men and women. He boasted--apparently with reason--that the  authorities at Haifa were powerless to touch him.    [ILLUSTRATION: HAIFA AND THE BAY OF AKKA. LOOKING EAST FROM MOUNT  CARMEL]    There was one hope left. Djemal Pasha had boasted that he had introduced  law and order; the country was under military rule; it remained to see  what he would say and do when the crimes of Fewzi Bey were brought to  his notice. Accordingly, armed with my _boyouroulton_, or passport, of a  locust-inspector, I rode to Jerusalem, where I procured, through my  brother, who was then in favor, an interview with Djemal Pasha. He  received me on the very day of my arrival, and listened attentively  while for a whole hour I poured out the story of Fewzi Bey's outrages. I  put my whole heart into the plea and wound up by asking if it was to the  credit of the progressive Young Turks to shelter feudal abuses of a  bygone age. Djemal seemed to be impressed. He sprang from his chair,  began walking up and down the room; then with a great dramatic gesture  he exclaimed, \"Justice shall be rendered!\" and assured me that a  commission of army officers would be sent at once to start an  investigation. I returned to Zicron-Jacob with high hopes.    Sure enough, a few days later Fewzi Bey was summoned to Jerusalem; at  the same time the \"commission,\" which had dwindled to one single officer  on secret mission, put in an appearance and began to make inquiries  among the natives. He got little satisfaction at first, for they lived  in mortal terror of the outlaw; they grew bolder, however, when they  learned his purpose. Complaints and testimonies came pouring in, and in  four days the officer had the names of hundreds of witnesses,  establishing no less than fifty-two crimes of the most serious nature.  Fewzi's friends and relatives, in the mean while, were doing their  utmost to stem the tide of accusations. The Kaimakam (lieutenant-  governor) of Haifa came in person to our village and threatened the  elders with all sorts of severities if they did not retract the charges  they had made. But they stood firm. Had not Djemal Pasha, commander-in-  chief of the armies in Palestine, given his word of honor that we should  have redress?    We were soon shown the depth of our naivete in fancying that justice  could be done in Turkey by a Turk. Fewzi Bey came back from Jerusalem,  not in convict's clothes, but in the uniform of a Turkish officer!  Djemal Pasha had commissioned him commandant of the Moujahaddeen  (religious militia) of the entire region! It was bad enough to stand him  as an outlaw; now we had to submit to him as an officer. He came riding  into our village daily, ordering everybody about and picking me out for  distinguished spitefulness.    My position soon became unbearable. I was, of course, known as the  organizer of the young men's union which for so long had put up a  spirited resistance to Fewzi; I was still looked upon as a leader of the  younger spirits, and I knew that sooner or later Fewzi would try to make  good his threat, often repeated, that he would \"shoot me like a dog.\" It  was hardly likely that an open attempt on my life would be made. When  Ambassador Morgenthau visited Palestine, he had stayed in our village  and given my family the evidence of his sincere friendship. These things  count in the East, and I soon got the reputation of having influential  friends. However, there were other ways of disposing of me. One evening,  about sunset, while I was riding through a valley near our village, my  horse shied violently in passing a clump of bushes. I gave him the spur  and turned and rode toward the bushes just in time to see a horseman  dash out wildly with a rifle across his saddle. I kept the incident to  myself, but I was more cautious and kept my eyes open wherever I went.  One afternoon, a fortnight later, as I was riding to Hedera, another  Jewish village, two hours' ride away, a shot was fired from behind a  sand-dune. The bullet burned a hole in the lapel of my coat.    That night I had a long talk with my brother. There was no doubt  whatever in his mind that I should try to leave the country, while I, on  the contrary, could not bear to think of deserting my people at the  crisis of their fortunes. It was a beautiful night, such a night, I  think, as only Palestine can show, a white, serene, moon-bathed night.  The roar of the Mediterranean came out of the stillness as if to remind  us that help and salvation could come only from the sea, the sea upon  which scores of the warships of the Allies were sailing back and forth.  We had argued into the small hours before I yielded to his persuasion.    [ILLUSTRATION: THE BAZAAR OF JAFFA ON A MARKET DAY]          CHAPTER X    A RASH ADVENTURE      It was all very well to decide to leave the country; to get safely away  was a different matter. There were two ways out. One of these--the land  route by Constantinople--could not be considered. The other way was to  board one of the American cruisers which, by order of Ambassador  Morgenthau, were empowered to assist citizens of neutral countries to  leave the Ottoman Empire. These cruisers had already done wonderful  rescue work for the Russian Jews in Palestine, who, when war was  declared, were to have been sent to the Mesopotamian town of Urfa--there  to suffer massacre and outrage like the Armenians. This was prevented by  Mr. Morgenthau's strenuous representations, with the result that these  Russian Jews were gathered together as in a great drag-net and herded to  Jaffa, amidst suffering unspeakable. There they were met by the American  cruisers which were to transport them to Egypt. Up to the very moment  when they set foot on the friendly warships they were robbed and  horribly abused by the Jaffa boatmen. The eternal curse of the  Wandering Jew! Driven from Russia, they come to seek shelter in Turkey;  Turkey then casts them from her under pretext that they are loyal to  Russia. Truly, the Jew lifts his eyes to the mountains, asking the  ancient and still unanswered question, \"Whence shall come my help?\"    The Turkish Government later repented of its leniency in allowing these  Russian Jews to escape, and gave orders that only neutrals should leave  the country--and then only under certain conditions. I was not a  neutral; my first papers of American citizenship were valueless to  further my escape. I had heard, however, that the United States cruiser  Tennessee was to call at Jaffa, and I determined to get aboard her by  hook or by crook. One evening, as soon as darkness had fallen, I bade a  sorrowful farewell to my people, and set off for Jaffa, traveling only  by night and taking out-of-the-way paths to avoid the pickets, for now  that the locust campaign was over, my _boyouroulton_ was useless. At  dawn, two days later, I slipped into Jaffa by way of the sand-dunes and  went to the house of a friend whom I could trust to help me in every  possible way, and begged him to find me a passport for a neutral. He set  off in search and I waited all day at his house, consumed with  impatience and anxiety. At last, toward evening, my friend returned,  but the news he brought was not cheering. He had found a passport,  indeed, but his report of the rigors of the inspection at the wharf was  such as to make it clear that the chances of my getting through on a  false passport were exceedingly slim, since I was well known in Jaffa.  If I were caught in such an undertaking, it might mean death for me and  punishment for the friends who had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1036"],[0,"Joe Wilson and His Mates (#9)"],[1,"had a couple of  draught-horses, that I worked in the tip-drays when I was tank-sinking,  and one or two others running in the Bush. I bought a broken-down waggon  cheap, tinkered it up myself--christened it 'The Same Old Thing'--and  started carrying from the railway terminus through Gulgong and along the  bush roads and tracks that branch out fanlike through the scrubs to the  one-pub towns and sheep and cattle stations out there in the howling  wilderness. It wasn't much of a team. There were the two heavy horses  for 'shafters'; a stunted colt, that I'd bought out of the pound for  thirty shillings; a light, spring-cart horse; an old grey mare, with  points like a big red-and-white Australian store bullock, and with the  grit of an old washerwoman to work; and a horse that had spanked along  in Cob & Co.'s mail-coach in his time. I had a couple there that didn't  belong to me: I worked them for the feeding of them in the dry weather.  And I had all sorts of harness, that I mended and fixed up myself. It  was a mixed team, but I took light stuff, got through pretty quick, and  freight rates were high. So I got along.    Before this, whenever I made a few pounds I'd sink a shaft somewhere,  prospecting for gold; but Mary never let me rest till she talked me out  of that.    I made up my mind to take on a small selection farm--that an old mate of  mine had fenced in and cleared, and afterwards chucked up--about thirty  miles out west of Gulgong, at a place called Lahey's Creek. (The places  were all called Lahey's Creek, or Spicer's Flat, or Murphy's Flat, or  Ryan's Crossing, or some such name--round there.) I reckoned I'd have  a run for the horses and be able to grow a bit of feed. I always had a  dread of taking Mary and the children too far away from a doctor--or a  good woman neighbour; but there were some people came to live on Lahey's  Creek, and besides, there was a young brother of Mary's--a young scamp  (his name was Jim, too, and we called him 'Jimmy' at first to make room  for our Jim--he hated the name 'Jimmy' or James). He came to live with  us--without asking--and I thought he'd find enough work at Lahey's  Creek to keep him out of mischief. He wasn't to be depended on much--he  thought nothing of riding off, five hundred miles or so, 'to have a look  at the country'--but he was fond of Mary, and he'd stay by her till I  got some one else to keep her company while I was on the road. He would  be a protection against 'sundowners' or any shearers who happened to  wander that way in the 'D.T.'s' after a spree. Mary had a married sister  come to live at Gulgong just before we left, and nothing would suit her  and her husband but we must leave little Jim with them for a month or  so--till we got settled down at Lahey's Creek. They were newly married.    Mary was to have driven into Gulgong, in the spring-cart, at the end  of the month, and taken Jim home; but when the time came she wasn't too  well--and, besides, the tyres of the cart were loose, and I hadn't time  to get them cut, so we let Jim's time run on a week or so longer, till I  happened to come out through Gulgong from the river with a small load of  flour for Lahey's Creek way. The roads were good, the weather grand--no  chance of it raining, and I had a spare tarpaulin if it did--I would  only camp out one night; so I decided to take Jim home with me.    Jim was turning three then, and he was a cure. He was so old-fashioned  that he used to frighten me sometimes--I'd almost think that there was  something supernatural about him; though, of course, I never took any  notice of that rot about some children being too old-fashioned to live.  There's always the ghoulish old hag (and some not so old nor haggish  either) who'll come round and shake up young parents with such croaks  as, 'You'll never rear that child--he's too bright for his age.' To the  devil with them! I say.    But I really thought that Jim was too intelligent for his age, and I  often told Mary that he ought to be kept back, and not let talk too much  to old diggers and long lanky jokers of Bushmen who rode in and hung  their horses outside my place on Sunday afternoons.    I don't believe in parents talking about their own children  everlastingly--you get sick of hearing them; and their kids are  generally little devils, and turn out larrikins as likely as not.    But, for all that, I really think that Jim, when he was three years old,  was the most wonderful little chap, in every way, that I ever saw.    For the first hour or so, along the road, he was telling me all about  his adventures at his auntie's.    'But they spoilt me too much, dad,' he said, as solemn as a native bear.  'An' besides, a boy ought to stick to his parrans!'    I was taking out a cattle-pup for a drover I knew, and the pup took up a  good deal of Jim's time.    Sometimes he'd jolt me, the way he talked; and other times I'd have  to turn away my head and cough, or shout at the horses, to keep from  laughing outright. And once, when I was taken that way, he said--    'What are you jerking your shoulders and coughing, and grunting, and  going on that way for, dad? Why don't you tell me something?'    'Tell you what, Jim?'    'Tell me some talk.'    So I told him all the talk I could think of. And I had to brighten up,  I can tell you, and not draw too much on my imagination--for Jim was a  terror at cross-examination when the fit took him; and he didn't think  twice about telling you when he thought you were talking nonsense. Once  he said--    'I'm glad you took me home with you, dad. You'll get to know Jim.'    'What!' I said.    'You'll get to know Jim.'    'But don't I know you already?'    'No, you don't. You never has time to know Jim at home.'    And, looking back, I saw that it was cruel true. I had known in my heart  all along that this was the truth; but it came to me like a blow from  Jim. You see, it had been a hard struggle for the last year or so; and  when I was home for a day or two I was generally too busy, or too tired  and worried, or full of schemes for the future, to take much notice of  Jim. Mary used to speak to me about it sometimes. 'You never take notice  of the child,' she'd say. 'You could surely find a few minutes of an  evening. What's the use of always worrying and brooding? Your brain will  go with a snap some day, and, if you get over it, it will teach you a  lesson. You'll be an old man, and Jim a young one, before you realise  that you had a child once. Then it will be too late.'    This sort of talk from Mary always bored me and made me impatient with  her, because I knew it all too well. I never worried for myself--only  for Mary and the children. And often, as the days went by, I said to  myself, 'I'll take more notice of Jim and give Mary more of my time,  just as soon as I can see things clear ahead a bit.' And the hard days  went on, and the weeks, and the months, and the years---- Ah, well!    Mary used to say, when things would get worse, 'Why don't you talk  to me, Joe? Why don't you tell me your thoughts, instead of shutting  yourself up in yourself and brooding--eating your heart out? It's hard  for me: I get to think you're tired of me, and selfish. I might be cross  and speak sharp to you when you are in trouble. How am I to know, if you  don't tell me?'    But I didn't think she'd understand.    And so, getting acquainted, and chumming and dozing, with the gums  closing over our heads here and there, and the ragged patches of  sunlight and shade passing up, over the horses, over us, on the front of  the load, over the load, and down on to the white, dusty road again--Jim  and I got along the lonely Bush road and over the ridges, some fifteen  miles before sunset, and camped at Ryan's Crossing on Sandy Creek for  the night. I got the horses out and took the harness off. Jim wanted  badly to help me, but I made him stay on the load; for one of the  horses--a vicious, red-eyed chestnut--was a kicker: he'd broken a  man's leg. I got the feed-bags stretched across the shafts, and the  chaff-and-corn into them; and there stood the horses all round with  their rumps north, south, and west, and their heads between the shafts,  munching and switching their tails. We use double shafts, you know, for  horse-teams--two pairs side by side,--and prop them up, and stretch bags  between them, letting the bags sag to serve as feed-boxes. I threw the  spare tarpaulin over the wheels on one side, letting about half of  it lie on the ground in case of damp, and so making a floor and a  break-wind. I threw down bags and the blankets and 'possum rug against  the wheel to make a camp for Jim and the cattle-pup, and got a gin-case  we used for a tucker-box, the frying-pan and billy down, and made a good  fire at a log close handy, and soon everything was comfortable. Ryan's  Crossing was a grand camp. I stood with my pipe in my mouth, my hands  behind my back, and my back to the fire, and took the country in.    Reedy Creek came down along a western spur of the range: the banks here  were deep and green, and the water ran clear over the granite bars,  boulders, and gravel. Behind us was a dreary flat covered with those  gnarled, grey-barked, dry-rotted 'native apple-trees' (about as much  like apple-trees as the native bear is like any other), and a nasty bit  of sand-dusty road that I was always glad to get over in wet weather.  To the left on our side of the creek were reedy marshes, with frogs  croaking, and across the creek the dark box-scrub-covered ridges ended  in steep 'sidings' coming down to the creek-bank, and to the main road  that skirted them, running on west up over a 'saddle' in the ridges and  on towards Dubbo. The road by Lahey's Creek to a place called Cobborah  branched off, through dreary apple-tree and stringy-bark flats, to the  left, just beyond the crossing: all these fanlike branch tracks from the  Cudgeegong were inside a big horse-shoe in the"]]]
