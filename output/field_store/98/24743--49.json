Thus, we  find that in most of the swiftest sewing machines, the needle bar is  actuated by a simple crank pin or eccentric, there being no loop dip or  pause in its motion.    The diagram shows a positive take-up in three positions--at the  commencement of the needle's descent, during the detention of the loop by  the beak, and during the casting off of the loop. The dotted lines indicate  the path of the cam to produce these positions. The intermittent movements  of the take-up have thus led to the abandonment of variable motions in both  needle and shuttle, and particularly so in oscillating shuttle machines.    _Wheeler & Wilson's Variable Motion_.--But while the simple and direct  movement is now preferred for shuttles, both oscillating and rotary, the  revolving hooks of Wheeler & Wilson are provided with a differential  motion, and the way it is effected appears sufficiently interesting to call  for a short description. When the rotating hook has seized the loop of  thread, it makes half a revolution with great rapidity; its speed then  slackens, and becomes very slow for the remaining half a revolution. In the  first machines introduced, this was effected by means of a revolving disk,  having slots in which worked pins attached to the main shaft and hook shaft  respectively.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    In the later and more improved machines, the variable device is much  simplified (Fig. 5). The main shaft, leading to the rotating hook, is  separated into two portions, the axis of one portion being placed above  that of the other. A crank pin is attached to each, and these pins are  connected together by a simple link. An examination of the device itself  shows that, while the motion of the main shaft portion is uniform, that of  the hook shaft is alternately accelerated and retarded.    The picture on the screen gives a general view of the No. 10 D machine, in  which these motions are embodied, and showing the position of the positive  take-up affected by those motions, a position which is preferred for very  high speeds in this machine, especially for threads possessing little  elasticity.    _Motions of the Feeder_.--The speed attained by the fastest sewing machines  is due more to the reduction and simplification of the movements than to  any other improvement. Heavy concessions and reactions have been replaced  by direct motions, and cams have been excluded as much as possible. Mr.  A.B. Wilson's famous invention of the four motion feeder depended upon both  gravity and a reacting spring for two motions. Singer improved upon it by  making three of the motions positive, a spring being used for the drop. But  a really positive four motion feeder was long sought by inventors.    Hitherto the reaction of the feeder--that is, its descent and  recession--was generally attained by means of a spring. The drop and ascent  are now effected by means of a separate eccentric in Singer's machine.  Uncertainty of action in the feed, once a cause of much inconvenience, may  now be said to be overcome. A peculiarity of the four motion feeder in  Wheeler & Wilson's machine is an arrangement enabling the operator to feed  in either direction at will.    Not less worthy of note are improvements that have been made in wheel  feeders. The wheel feed was originally much used for cloth sewing machines,  especially in Singer's system. But in recent years the drop or four motion  feeder has entirely superseded it for such purposes. The wheel feed still  holds its own, however, for sewing leather, especially in the \"closing\" of  boot uppers, in this country. Singer's original wheel feeder was actuated  by a friction shoe riding upon the flange of the wheel. The friction grip,  however, had certain faults, owing to the tendency of the shoe to slip when  the surfaces became covered with oil.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    A later form of Howe's machine used a pair of angular clutches, embracing  the flange of the wheel. In both Singer's and Wheeler & Wilson's latest  styles of machines this arrangement is simplified and improved by the use  of a single angle clutch, which is found to work even when the surfaces are  freely oiled (Fig. 6).    Any motion of the free extremity of the lever upon which the biting clutch  is formed binds the latter upon the flange of the wheel, which then  advances so long as the lever continues to move in that direction. When the  stitch is completed, the clutch is allowed to recede, and is pulled back by  a reacting spring. The bite of the clutch is given by the two opposite  corners.    The feed wheel itself is free to revolve in a forward direction, but is  prevented from rocking backward in Singer's machine by an ingenious little  device, recently introduced. It consists of a small steel roller, situated  within the angle formed by an inclined plane and the flange of the wheel,  and constantly pulled into the angle by a spiral spring. Any backward  tendency of the wheel binds the roller more firmly in the angle and stops  the wheel. Former feed wheels were checked by a brake spring or block,  which retarded the motion of the whole machine when heavily adjusted.    _Feeders for Button Hole Sewing Machines_ are almost invariably of the  wheel type, but in this case the cloth is usually carried by a clamping  device, and moved in a pear-shaped path by means of a cam cut in the feed  wheel, as shown in the samples of this wonderful kind of mechanism  exhibited here to-night.    _The Compensating System of Construction_.--Compensation for wear is a part  of the mechanist's art that appears just as essential to him as  compensation for variation of temperature is to a maker of chronometers. In  the construction of sewing machines to be run in factories by power at  their utmost speed, such a system is of the greatest importance. An  effective _system_ of compensation has been eagerly sought by the best  machine makers ever since the introduction of fast speed sewing.    Compensation has been attempted here and there in the machines for many  years, but no sewing apparatus could be said to be so compensated until the  cone compensator came into use, a device which has been taken advantage of  by various makers. Save in the shuttle race itself there is not a part of  the oscillating shuttle machine subject to serious wear that cannot be  instantly adjusted to full motion by the turning of a screw, while wear in  the shuttle race can be compensated for in the usual way. This effective  system depends upon the union of two mathematical forms, long used in  mechanism--the _cone_ and the _screw_. In screw cones we possess a perfect  compensator, and it is surprising that parts of mechanism so hung appear  subject to very little wear. Another advantage, too, is gained by the  introduction of screw cone bearings; the friction is always greatly reduced  by their use. In every case the fine adjustment of the cones is securely  maintained by locknuts (Fig. 7).    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    But the screw cone system is not the only compensator used in sewing  machinery; where it cannot be easily introduced, other devices have been  employed.    The well known tapering needle bars of former years have been superseded by  cylindrical needle bars. The Wheeler & Wilson Company appear to be the  first who utilized the engineer's shifting box as an antifriction device  for round needle bars. They packed their bars round with felt rings, and  compressed the whole by a screw cap.    In the Singer machines the same excellent device has been adopted, hemp  packing and screw bushes being used (Fig. 8); _f_ and _g_ show the direct  action on the needle bar. This method of forming needle bar bearings,  partially of metal and partially of felt or hemp, has afforded the most  surprising results.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    When the bars are of hard or finely polished steel, no perceptible wear can  be detected in them, even after they have been in daily use in factories  for twelve months, whereas bars not so bushed might show considerable wear  in that space of time. The packing, to be effective, should be sufficiently  close to prevent as much as possible friction of the steel with the cast  iron needle bar ways. Lubrication of the steel is insured by keeping the  hemp packing moistened with oil.    Cylindrical needle bars, when combined with an effective system of  brushing, have proved themselves superior to every other form of slide for  lock stitch machines. But their introduction is by no means a thing of  yesterday. They were used freely in sewing machines as far back as 1860,  but were never very successful until united with the lubricating brush.  Some makers go a step further, and elaborate the system by the introduction  of steel brushes, easily renewable.    Every effort is now made to reduce, as much as possible, not only the  extent of movement of the parts in high speed machines, but the weight of  the parts themselves. Indeed, so far has this been carried that, in some of  the Wheeler & Wilson machines now shown, the needle bars consist really of  steel tubes. Small moving parts are made as light as possible, but rigidity  is secured by the free use of strengthening ribs. Many of the parts are of  cast iron, rendered malleable by annealing, and finally casehardened. Such  parts are found to be quite as durable as if made of forged steel, and are,  of course, less costly. As to the automatic tools now used in the  construction of the machines, it may be said that scarcely a file, hammer,  or chisel touches the frame or parts while they are being assembled to work  together. The interchangeable system of construction is, of course, the  only one possible for the accurate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#9)"],[1," entered into with Mr. Blake, with the same unsatisfactory  termination. He did not take it quite as calmly as I did, though he  was of too reserved a nature to display much emotion over anything.  The prospect of a long tedious evening spent in a country hotel seemed  almost unendurable to him, but he finally succumbed to the force of  circumstances, as indeed he seemed obliged to do, and partaking of such  refreshment as the rather poorly managed hotel afforded, retired without  ceremony to his room, from which he did not emerge again till next  morning. In all this he had somehow managed not to give his name; and by  means of some inquiries I succeeded in making that evening, I found his  person was unknown in the town.    By a little management I secured the next room to his, by which  arrangement I succeeded in passing a sleepless night, Mr. Blake spending  most of the wee sma' hours in pacing the floor of his room, with an  unremitting regularity that had anything but a soothing effect upon my  nerves. Early the next morning we took the stage, he sitting on the back  seat, and I in front with the driver. There were other passengers, but  I noticed he never spoke to any of them, nor through all the long drive  did he once look up from the corner where he had ensconced himself. It  was twelve o'clock when we reached the end of the route, a small town  of somewhat less than the usual pretensions of mountain villages; so  insignificant indeed, that I found it more and more difficult to imagine  what the wealthy ex-Congressman could find in such a spot as this, to  make amends for a journey of such length and discomfort; when to my  increasing wonder I heard him give orders for a horse to be saddled and  brought round to the inn door directly after dinner. This was a move I  had not expected and it threw me a little aback, for although I had thus  far managed to hold myself so aloof from Mr. Blake, even while keeping  him under my eye, that no suspicion of my interest in his movements had  as yet been awakened, how could I thus for the third time follow his  order with one precisely similar, without attracting an attention that  would be fatal to my plans. Yet to let him ride off alone now, would be  to drop the trail at the very moment the scent became of importance.    The landlord, a bustling, wiry little man all nervousness and questions,  unwittingly helped me at this crisis.    \"Are you going on to Perry, sir?\" inquired he of that gentleman, \"I have  been expecting a man along these three days bound for Perry.\"    \"I am that man,\" I broke in, stepping forward with some appearance of  asperity, \"and I hope you won't keep me waiting. A horse as soon as  dinner is over, do you hear? I am two days late now, and won't stand any  nonsense.\"    And to escape the questions sure to follow, I strode into the  dining-room with a half-fierce, half-sullen countenance, that  effectually precluded all advances. During the meal I saw Mr. Blake's  eye roam more than once towards my face; but I did not return his gaze,  or notice him in any way; hurrying through my dinner, and mounting the  first horse brought around, as if time were my only consideration. But  once on the road I took the first opportunity to draw rein and wait,  suddenly remembering that I had not heard Mr. Blake give any intimation  of the direction he intended taking. A few minutes revealed to me his  elegant form well mounted and showing to perfection in his closely  buttoned coat, slowly approaching up the road. Taking advantage of  a rise in the ground, I lingered till he was almost upon me, when I  cantered quickly on, fearing to arouse his apprehensions if I allowed  him to pass me on a road so solitary as that which now stretched out  before us: a move provocative of much embarassment to me, as I dared not  turn my head for the same reason, anxious as I was to keep him in sight.    The roads dividing before me, at length gave me my first opportunity  to pause and look back. He was some fifty paces behind. Waiting till he  came up, I bowed with the surly courtesy I thought in keeping with the  character I had assumed, and asked if he knew which road led towards  Perry, saying I had come off in such haste I had forgotten to inquire my  way. He returned my bow, pointed towards the left hand road and saying,  \"I know this does not,\" calmly took it.    Now here was a dilemma. If in face of this curt response I proceeded to  follow him, my hand was revealed at once; yet the circumstances  would admit of no other course. I determined to compromise matters by  pretending to take the right hand road till he was out of sight, when I  would return and follow him swiftly upon the left. Accordingly I reined  my horse to the right, and for some fifteen minutes galloped slowly  away towards the north; but another fifteen saw me facing the west, and  riding with a force and fury of which I had not thought the old mare  they had given me capable, till I put her to the test. It was not long  before I saw my fine gentleman trotting in front of me up a long but  gentle slope that rose in the distance; and slackening my own rein, I  withdrew into the forest at the side of the road, till he had passed its  summit and disappeared, when I again galloped forward.    And thus we went on for an hour, over the most uneven country I ever  traversed, he always one hill ahead; when suddenly, by what instinct I  cannot determine, I felt myself approaching the end, and hastening to  the top of the ascent up which I was then laboring, looked down into the  shallow valley spread out before me.    What a sight met my eyes if I had been intent on anything less practical  than the movements of the solitary horseman below! Hills on hills piled  about a verdant basin in whose depths nestled a scanty collection of  houses, in number so small they could be told upon the fingers of the  right hand, but which notwithstanding lent an indescribable aspect of  comfort to this remote region of hill and forest.    But the vision of Mr. Blake pausing half way down the slope before me,  examining, yes examining a pistol which he held in his hand, soon put  an end to all ideas of romance. Somewhat alarmed I reined back; but his  action had evidently no connection with me, for he did not once glance  behind him, but kept his eye on the road which I now observed took a  short turn towards a house of so weird and ominous an appearance that I  scarcely marvelled at his precaution.    Situated on a level track of land at the crossing of three roads, its  spacious front, rude and unpainted as it was, presented every appearance  of an inn, but from its moss-grown chimneys no smoke arose, nor could  I detect any sign of life in its shutterless windows and closed doors,  across which shivered the dark shadow of the one gaunt and aged pine,  that stood like a guard beside its tumbled-down porch.    Mr. Blake seemed to have been struck by the same fact concerning its  loneliness, for hurriedly replacing his pistol in his breast pocket, he  rode slowly forward. I instantly conceived the plan of striking across  the belt of underbrush that separated me from this old dwelling, and by  taking my stand opposite its front, intercept a view of Mr. Blake as  he approached. Hastily dismounting, therefore, I led my horse into the  bushes and tied her to a tree, proceeding to carry out my plan on foot.  I was so far successful as to arrive at the further edge of the wood,  which was thick enough to conceal my presence without being too dense to  obstruct my vision, just as Mr. Blake passed on his way to this solitary  dwelling. He was looking very anxious, but determined. Turning my eyes  from him, I took another glance at the house, which by this movement I  had brought directly before me. It was even more deserted-looking than  I had thought; its unpainted front with its double row of blank windows  meeting your gaze without a response, while the huge old pine with half  its limbs dismantled of foliage, rattled its old bones against its sides  and moaned in its aged fashion like the solitary retainer of a dead  race.    I own I felt the cold shivers creep down my back as that creaking sound  struck my ears, though as the day was chill with an east wind I dare say  it was more the effect of my sudden cessation from exercise, than of  any superstitious awe I felt. Mr. Blake seemed to labor under no such  impressions. Riding up to the front door he knocked without dismounting,  on its dismal panels with his riding whip. No response was heard.  Knitting his brows impatiently, he tried the latch: the door was locked.  Hastily running his eye over the face of the building, he drew rein and  proceeded to ride around the house, which he could easily do owing  to the absence of every obstruction in the way of fence or shrubbery.  Finding no means of entrance he returned again to the front door which  he shook with an impatient hand that however produced no impression  upon the trusty lock, and recognizing, doubtless, the futility of his  endeavors, he drew back, and merely pausing to give one other look at  its deserted front, turned his horse's head, and to my great amazement,  proceeded with sombre mien and clouded brow to retake the road to  Melville.    This old inn or decayed homestead was then the object of his lengthened  and tedious journey; this ancient house rotting away among the bleak  hills of Vermont, the bourne towards which his steps had been tending  for these past two days. I could not understand it. Rapidly emerging  from the spot where I had secreted myself, I in my turn made a circuit  of the house, if happily I should discover some loophole of entrance  which had escaped his attention. But every door and window was securely  barred, and I was about to follow his example and leave the spot, when  I saw two or three children advancing towards me down the cross roads,  gaily swinging their school books."]]]
