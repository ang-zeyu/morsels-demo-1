[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5713"],[0,"Tales of War (#8)"],[1,"An exhalation arose, drawn up by the moon, from an old battlefield  after the passing of years. It came out of very old craters and  gathered from trenches, smoked up from No Man's Land, and the ruins of  farms; it rose from the rottenness of dead brigades, and lay for half  the night over two armies; but at midnight the moon drew it up all  into one phantom and it rose and trailed away eastwards.    It passed over men in grey that were weary of war; it passed over a  land once prosperous, happy and mighty, in which were a people that  were gradually starving; it passed by ancient belfries in which there  were no bells now; it passed over fear and misery and weeping, and so  came to the palace at Potsdam. It was the dead of the night between  midnight and dawn, and the palace was very still that the Emperor  might sleep, and sentries guarded it who made no noise and relieved  others in silence. Yet it was not so easy to sleep. Picture to  yourself a murderer who had killed a man. Would you sleep? Picture  yourself the man that planned this war! Yes, you sleep, but nightmares  come.    The phantom entered the chamber. \"Come,\" it said.    The Kaiser leaped up at once as obediently as when he came to  attention on parade, years ago, as a subaltern in the Prussian Guard,  a man whom no woman or child as yet had ever cursed; he leaped up and  followed. They passed the silent sentries; none challenged and none  saluted; they were moving swiftly over the town as the felon Gothas  go; they came to a cottage in the country. They drifted over a little  garden gate, and there in a neat little garden the phantom halted like  a wind that has suddenly ceased. \"Look,\" it said.    Should he look? Yet he must look. The Kaiser looked; and saw a window  shining and a neat room in the cottage: there was nothing dreadful  there; thank the good German God for that; it was all right, after  all. The Kaiser had had a fright, but it was all right; there was only  a woman with a baby sitting before the fire, and two small children  and a man. And it was quite a jolly room. And the man was a young  soldier; and, why, he was a Prussian Guardsman,--there was his  helmet hanging on the wall,--so everything was all right. They were  jolly German children; that was well. How nice and homely the room  was. There shone before him, and showed far off in the night, the  visible reward of German thrift and industry. It was all so tidy and  neat, and yet they were quite poor people. The man had done his work  for the Fatherland, and yet beyond all that had been able to afford  all those little knickknacks that make a home so pleasant and that in  their humble little way were luxury. And while the Kaiser looked the  two young children laughed as they played on the floor, not seeing  that face at the window.    Why! Look at the helmet. That was lucky. A bullet hole right through  the front of it. That must have gone very close to the man's head. How  ever did it get through? It must have glanced upwards as bullets  sometimes do. The hole was quite low in the helmet. It would be  dreadful to have bullets coming by close like that. The firelight  flickered, and the lamp shone on, and the children played on the  floor, and the man was smoking out of a china pipe; he was strong and  able and young, one of the wealth-winners of Germany.    \"Have you seen?\" said the phantom.    \"Yes,\" said the Kaiser. It was well, he thought, that a Kaiser  should see how his people lived.    At once the fire went out and the lamp faded away, the room fell  sombrely into neglect and squalor, and the soldier and the children  faded away with the room; all disappeared phantasmally, and nothing  remained but the helmet in a kind of glow on the wall, and the woman  sitting all by herself in the darkness.    \"It has all gone,\" said the Kaiser.    \"It has never been,\" said the phantom.    The Kaiser looked again. Yes, there was nothing there, it was just a  vision. There were the grey walls all damp and uncared for, and that  helmet standing out solid and round, like the only real thing among  fancies. No, it had never been. It was just a vision.    \"It might have been,\" said the phantom.    Might have been? How might it have been?    \"Come,\" said the phantom.    They drifted away down a little lane that in summer would have had  roses, and came to an Uhlan's house; in times of peace a small farmer.  Farm buildings in good repair showed even in the night, and the black  shapes of haystacks; again a well-kept garden lay by the house. The  phantom and the Kaiser stood in the garden; before them a window  glowed in a lamplit room.    \"Look,\" said the phantom.    The Kaiser looked again and saw a young couple; the woman played with  a baby, and all was prosperous in the merry room. Again the hard-won  wealth of Germany shone out for all to see, the cosy comfortable  furniture spoke of acres well cared for, spoke of victory in the  struggle with the seasons on which wealth of nations depends.    \"It might have been,\" said the phantom. Again the fire died out and  the merry scene faded away, leaving a melancholy, ill-kept room, with  poverty and mourning haunting dusty corners and the woman sitting  alone.    \"Why do you show me this?\" said the Kaiser. \"Why do you show me  these visions?\"    \"Come,\" said the phantom.    \"What is it?\" said the Kaiser. \"Where are you bringing me?\"    \"Come,\" said the phantom.    They went from window to window, from land to land. You had seen, had  you been out that night in Germany, and able to see visions, an  imperious figure passing from place to place, looking on many scenes.  He looked on them, and families withered away, and happy scenes faded,  and the phantom said to him \"Come.\" He expostulated but obeyed; and  so they went from window to window of hundreds of farms in Prussia,  till they came to the Prussian border and went on into Saxony; and  always you would have heard, could you hear spirits speak, \"It might  have been,\" \"It might have been,\" repeated from window to window.    They went down through Saxony, heading for Austria. And for long the  Kaiser kept that callous, imperious look. But at last he, even he, at  last he nearly wept. And the phantom turned then and swept him back  over Saxony, and into Prussia again and over the sentries' heads, back  to his comfortable bed where it was so hard to sleep.    And though they had seen thousands of merry homes, homes that can  never be merry now, shrines of perpetual mourning; though they had  seen thousands of smiling German children, who will never be born now,  but were only the visions of hopes blasted by him; for all the leagues  over which he had been so ruthlessly hurried, dawn was yet barely  breaking.    He had looked on the first few thousand homes of which he had robbed  all time, and which he must see with his eyes before he may go hence.  The first night of the Kaiser's punishment was accomplished.          The English Spirit      By the end of the South African war Sergeant Cane had got one thing  very well fixed in his mind, and that was that war was an overrated  amusement. He said he \"was fed up with it,\" partly because that  misused metaphor was then new, partly because every one was saying it:  he felt it right down in his bones, and he had a long memory. So when  wonderful rumours came to the East Anglian village where he lived, on  August 1, 1914, Sergeant Cane said: \"That means war,\" and decided  then and there to have nothing to do with it: it was somebody else's  turn; he felt he had done enough. Then came August 4th, and England  true to her destiny, and then Lord Kitchener's appeal for men.  Sergeant Cane had a family to look after and a nice little house: he  had left the army ten years.    In the next week all the men went who had been in the army before, all  that were young enough, and a good sprinkling of the young men too who  had never been in the army. Men asked Cane if he was going, and he  said straight out \"No.\"    By the middle of August Cane was affecting the situation. He was a  little rallying point for men who did not want to go. \"He knows what  it's like,\" they said.    In the smoking room of the Big House sat the Squire and his son, Arthur  Smith; and Sir Munion Boomer-Platt, the Member for the division. The  Squire's son had been in the last war as a boy, and like Sergeant Cane  had left the army since. All the morning he had been cursing an  imaginary general, seated in the War Office at an imaginary desk with  Smith's own letter before him, in full view but unopened. Why on earth  didn't he answer it, Smith thought. But he was calmer now, and the  Squire and Sir Munion were talking of Sergeant Cane.    \"Leave him to me,\" said Sir Munion.    \"Very well,\" said the Squire. So Sir Munion Boomer-Platt went off  and called on Sergeant Cane.    Mrs Cane knew what he had come for.    \"Don't let him talk you over, Bill,\" she said.    \"Not he,\" said Sergeant Cane.    Sir Munion came on Sergeant Cane in his garden.    \"A fine day,\" said Sir Munion. And from that he went on to the war.  \"If you enlist,\" he said, \"they will make you a sergeant again at  once. You will get a sergeant's pay, and your wife will get the new  separation allowance.\"    \"Sooner have Cane,\" said Mrs Cane.    \"Yes, yes, of course,\" said Sir Munion. \"But then there is the  medal, probably two or three medals, and the glory of it, and it is  such a splendid life.\"    Sir Munion did warm to a thing whenever he began to hear his own  words. He painted war as it has always been painted, one of the most  beautiful things you could imagine. And then it mustn't be supposed  that it was like those wars that there used to be, a long way off.  There would be houses where you would be billeted, and good food, and  shady trees and villages wherever you went. And it was such an  opportunity of seeing the Continent (\"the Continent as it really  is,\" Sir Munion called it) as would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],[0,"The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#8)"],[1,"in.      The shed was almost quite full of  feathers--it was almost suffocating;  but it was comfortable and very soft.    Jemima Puddle-duck was rather  surprised to find such a vast quantity  of feathers. But it was very  comfortable; and she made a nest  without any trouble at all.    When she came out, the sandy-  whiskered gentleman was sitting on a  log reading the newspaper--at least  he had it spread out, but he was  looking over the top of it.    He was so polite that he seemed  almost sorry to let Jemima go home  for the night. He promised to take  great care of her nest until she came  back again the next day.    He said he loved eggs and  ducklings; he should be proud to see a  fine nestful in his woodshed.    Jemima Puddle-duck came every  afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the  nest. They were greeny white and very  large. The foxy gentleman admired  them immensely. He used to turn  them over and count them when  Jemima was not there.    At last Jemima told him that she  intended to begin to sit next day--\"and  I will bring a bag of corn with me, so  that I need never leave my nest until  the eggs are hatched. They might catch  cold,\" said the conscientious Jemima.      \"Madam, I beg you not to trouble  yourself with a bag; I will provide  oats. But before you commence your  tedious sitting, I intend to give you a  treat. Let us have a dinner party all to  ourselves!    \"May I ask you to bring up some  herbs from the farm garden to make  a savory omelet? Sage and thyme, and  mint and two onions, and some  parsley. I will provide lard for the  stuff--lard for the omelet,\" said the  hospitable gentleman with sandy  whiskers.    Jemima Puddle-duck was a  simpleton: not even the mention of  sage and onions made her suspicious.    She went round the farm garden,  nibbling off snippets of all the  different sorts of herbs that are used  for stuffing roast duck.    And she waddled into the kitchen  and got two onions out of a basket.    The collie dog Kep met her coming  out, \"What are you doing with those  onions? Where do you go every  afternoon by yourself, Jemima  Puddle-duck?\"    Jemima was rather in awe of the  collie; she told him the whole story.    The collie listened, with his wise  head on one side; he grinned when  she described the polite gentleman  with sandy whiskers.      He asked several questions about  the wood and about the exact position  of the house and shed.    Then he went out, and trotted  down the village. He went to look for  two foxhound puppies who were out  at walk with the butcher.    Jemima Puddle-duck went up the  cart road for the last time, on a sunny  afternoon. She was rather burdened  with bunches of herbs and two onions  in a bag.    She flew over the wood, and  alighted opposite the house of the  bushy long-tailed gentleman.    He was sitting on a log; he sniffed  the air and kept glancing uneasily  round the wood. When Jemima  alighted he quite jumped.    \"Come into the house as soon as  you have looked at your eggs. Give me  the herbs for the omelet. Be sharp!\"    He was rather abrupt. Jemima  Puddle-duck had never heard him  speak like that.    She felt surprised and uncomfortable.    While she was inside she heard  pattering feet round the back of the  shed. Someone with a black nose  sniffed at the bottom of the door, and  them locked it.    Jemima became much alarmed.    A moment afterward there were  most awful noises--barking, baying,  growls and howls, squealing and  groans.    And nothing more was ever seen of  that foxy-whiskered gentleman.    Presently Kep opened the door of  the shed and let out Jemima Puddle-  duck.    Unfortunately the puppies rushed  in and gobbled up all the eggs before  he could stop them.    He had a bite on his ear, and both  the puppies were limping.      Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted  home in tears on account of those  eggs.    She laid some more in June, and she  was permitted to keep them herself:  but only four of them hatched.    Jemima Puddle-duck said that it  was because of her nerves; but she  had always been a bad sitter.          THE  ROLY-POLY PUDDING    [In Remembrance of \"Sammy,\"  the Intelligent Pink-Eyed Representative of  a Persecuted (But Irrepressible) Race.  An Affectionate Little Friend,  and Most Accomplished Thief!]          Once upon a time there was an old  cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who  was an anxious parent. She used to  lose her kittens continually, and  whenever they were lost they were  always in mischief!    On baking day she determined to  shut them up in a cupboard.    She caught Moppet and Mittens,  but she could not find Tom.    Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all  over the house, mewing for Tom  Kitten. She looked in the pantry under  the staircase, and she searched the  best spare bedroom that was all  covered up with dust sheets. She went  right upstairs and looked into the  attics, but she could not find him  anywhere.    It was an old, old house, full of  cupboards and passages. Some of the  walls were four feet thick, and there  used to be queer noises inside them,  as if there might be a little secret  staircase. Certainly there were odd  little jagged doorways in the wainscot,  and things disappeared at night--  especially cheese and bacon.    Mrs. Tabitha became more and  more distracted and mewed  dreadfully.    While their mother was searching  the house, Moppet and Mittens had  got into mischief.      The cupboard door was not locked,  so they pushed it open and came out.    They went straight to the dough  which was set to rise in a pan before  the fire.    They patted it with their little soft  paws--\"Shall we make dear little  muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet.    But just at that moment somebody  knocked at the front door, and  Moppet jumped into the flour barrel  in a fright.    Mittens ran away to the dairy and  hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf  where the milk pans stand.      The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs.  Ribby; she had called to borrow some  yeast.    Mr. Tabitha came downstairs  mewing dreadfully--\"Come in,  Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye  down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin  Ribby,\" said Tabitha, shedding tears.  \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm  afraid the rats have got him.\" She  wiped her eyes with her apron.    \"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha;  he made a cat's cradle of my best  bonnet last time I came to tea. Where  have you looked for him?\"    \"All over the house! The rats are too  many for me. What a thing it is to  have an unruly family!\" said Mrs.  Tabitha Twitchit.    \"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help  you to find him; and whip him, too!  What is all that soot in the fender?\"    \"The chimney wants sweeping--  Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now  Moppet and Mittens are gone!    \"They have both got out of the  cupboard!\"      Ribby and Tabitha set to work to  search the house thoroughly again.  They poked under the beds with  Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged  in cupboards. They even fetched a  candle and looked inside a clothes  chest in one of the attics. They could  not find anything, but once they  heard a door bang and somebody  scuttered downstairs.    \"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said  Tabitha tearfully. \"I caught seven  young ones out of one hole in the back  kitchen, and we had them for dinner  last Saturday. And once I saw the old  father rat--an enormous old rat--  Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump  upon him, when he showed his yellow  teeth at me and whisked down the  hole.    \"The rats get upon my nerves,  Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.    Ribby and Tabitha searched and  searched. They both heard a curious  roly-poly noise under the attic floor.  But there was nothing to be seen.    They returned to the kitchen.  \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\"  said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of  the flour barrel.      They shook the flour off her and set  her down on the kitchen floor. She  seemed to be in a terrible fright.    \"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said  Moppet, \"there's been an old woman  rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen  some of the dough!\"    The two cats ran to look at the  dough pan. Sure enough there were  marks of little scratching fingers, and  a lump of dough was gone!    \"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"    But Moppet had been too much  frightened to peep out of the barrel  again.    Ribby and Tabitha took her with  them to keep her safely in sight, while  they went on with their search.    They went into the dairy.    The first thing they found was  Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.    They tipped over the jar, and she  scrambled out.    \"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said  Mittens--      \"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has  been an old man rat in the dairy--a  dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother;  and he's stolen a pat of butter and the  rolling pin.\"    Ribby and Tabitha looked at one  another.    \"A rolling pin and butter! Oh, my  poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed  Tabitha, wringing her paws.    \"A rolling pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we  not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic  when we were looking into that  chest?\"    Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs  again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise  was still going on quite distinctly  under the attic floor.    \"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\"  said Ribby. \"We must send for John  Joiner at once, with a saw.\"    Now, this is what had been  happening to Tom Kitten, and it  shows how very unwise it is to go up a  chimney in a very old house, where a  person does not know his way, and  where there are enormous rats.      Tom Kitten did not want to be shut  up in a cupboard. When he saw that  his mother was going to bake, he  determined to hide.    He looked about for a nice  convenient place, and he fixed upon  the chimney.    The fire had only just been lighted,  and it was not hot; but there was a  white choky smoke from the green  sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender  and looked up. It was a big old-  fashioned fireplace.    The chimney itself was wide  enough inside for a man to stand "]]]
