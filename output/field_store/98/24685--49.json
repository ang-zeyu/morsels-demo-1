Would it not be an act of mere common   sense to say--These scratches have been made by the sharp points of   other stones which have rubbed against the pebbles somewhere, and   somewhen, with great force?    So far so good.  The next question is--How did these stones get into   the clay?  If we can discover that, we may also discover how they   wore rounded and scratched.  We must find a theory which will answer   our question; and one which, as Professor Huxley would say, \"will go   on all-fours,\" that is, will explain all the facts of the case, and   not only a few of them.    What, then, brought the stones?    We cannot, I think, answer that question, as some have tried to   answer it, by saying that they were brought by Noah's flood.  For it   is clear, that very violent currents of water would be needed to   carry boulders, some of them weighing many tons, for many miles.  Now   Scripture says nothing of any such violent currents; and we have no   right to put currents, or any other imagined facts, into Scripture   out of our own heads, and then argue from them as if not we, but the   text of Scripture had asserted their existence.    But still, they may have been rolled hither by water.  That theory   certainly would explain their being rounded; though not their being   scratched.  But it will not explain their being found in the clay.    Recollect what I said in my first paper:  that water drops its   pebbles and coarser particles first, while it carries the fine clayey   mud onward in solution, and only drops it when the water becomes   still.  Now currents of such tremendous violence as to carry these   boulder stones onward, would have carried the mud for many miles   farther still; and we should find the boulders, not in clay, but   lying loose together, probably on a hard rock bottom, scoured clean   by the current.  That is what we find in the beds of streams; that is   just what we do not find in this case.    But the boulders may have been brought by a current, and then the   water may have become still, and the clay settled quietly round them.    What?  Under them as well as over them?  On that theory also we   should find them only at the bottom of the clay.  As it is, we find   them scattered anywhere and everywhere through it, from top to   bottom.  So that theory will not do.  Indeed, no theory will do which   supposes them to have been brought by water alone.    Try yourself, dear reader, and make experiments, with running water,   pebbles, and mud.  If you try for seven years, I believe, you will   never contrive to make your pebbles lie about in your mud, as they   lie about in every pit in the boulder clay.    Well then, there we are at fault, it seems.  We have no explanation   drawn from known facts which will do--unless we are to suppose, which   I don't think you will do, that stones, clay, and all were blown   hither along the surface of the ground, by primeval hurricanes, ten   times worse than those of the West Indies, which certainly will roll   a cannon a few yards, but cannot, surely, roll a boulder stone a   hundred miles.    Now, suppose that there was a force, an agent, known--luckily for   you, not to you--but known too well to sailors and travellers; a   force which is at work over the vast sheets of land at both the north   and south poles; at work, too, on every high mountain range in the   world, and therefore a very common natural force; and suppose that   this force would explain all the facts, namely--    How the stones got here;    How they were scratched and rounded;    How they were imbedded in clay;    because it is notoriously, and before men's eyes now, carrying great   stones hundreds of miles, and scratching and rounding them also;   carrying vast deposits of mud, too, and mixing up mud and stones just   as we see them in the brick-pits,--Would not our common sense have a   right to try that explanation?--to suspect that this force, which we   do not see at work in Britain now, may have been at work here ages   since?  That would at least be reasoning from the known to the   unknown.  What state of things, then, do we find among the highest   mountains; and over whole countries which, though not lofty, lie far   enough north or south to be permanently covered with ice?    We find, first, an ice-cap or ice-sheet, fed by the winter's snows,   stretching over the higher land, and crawling downward and outward by   its own weight, along the valleys, as glaciers.    We find underneath the glaciers, first a moraine profonde, consisting   of the boulders and gravel, and earth, which the glacier has ground   off the hillsides, and is carrying down with it.    These stones, of course, grind, scratch, and polish each other; and   in like wise grind, scratch, and polish the rock over which they   pass, under the enormous weight of the superincumbent ice.    We find also, issuing from under each glacier a stream, carrying the   finest mud, the result of the grinding of the boulders against each   other and the glacier.    We find, moreover, on the surface of the glaciers, moraines   superieures--long lines of stones and dirt which had fallen from   neighbouring cliffs, and are now travelling downward with the   glaciers.    Their fate, if the glacier ends on land, is what was to be expected.    The stones from above the glacier fall over the ice-cliff at its end,   to mingle with those thrown out from underneath the glacier, and form   huge banks of boulders, called terminal moraines, while the mud runs   off, as all who have seen glaciers know, in a turbid torrent.    Their fate, again, is what was to be expected if the glacier ends, as   it commonly does in Arctic regions, in the sea.  The ice grows out to   sea-ward for more than a mile sometimes, about one-eighth of it being   above water, and seven-eighths below, so that an ice-cliff one   hundred feet high may project into water eight hundred feet deep.  At   last, when it gets out of its depth, the buoyancy of the water breaks   it off in icebergs, which float away, at the mercy of tides and   currents, often grounding again in shallower water, and ploughing the   sea-bottom as they drag along it.  These bergs carry stones and dirt,   often in large quantities; so that, whenever a berg melts or   capsizes, it strews its burden confusedly about the sea-floor.    Meanwhile the fine mud which is flowing out from under the ice goes   out to sea likewise, colouring the water far out, and then subsiding   as a soft tenacious ooze, in which the stones brought out by the ice   are imbedded.  And this ooze--so those who have examined it assert--  cannot be distinguished from the brick-clay, or fossiliferous   boulder-clay, so common in the North.  A very illustrious   Scandinavian explorer, visiting Edinburgh, declared, as soon as he   saw the sections of boulder-clay exhibited near that city, that this   was the very substance which he saw forming in the Spitzbergen ice-  fiords. {3}    I have put these facts as simply and baldly as I can, in order that   the reader may look steadily at them, without having his attention   drawn off, or his fancy excited, by their real poetry and grandeur.    Indeed, it would have been an impertinence to have done otherwise;   for I have never seen a live glacier, by land or sea, though I have   seen many a dead one.  And the public has had the opportunity,   lately, of reading so many delightful books about \"peaks, passes, and   glaciers,\" that I am bound to suppose that many of my readers know as   much, or more, about them than I do.    But let us go a step farther; and, bearing in our minds what live   glaciers are like, let us imagine what a dead glacier would be like;   a glacier, that is, which had melted, and left nothing but its   skeleton of stones and dirt.    We should find the faces of the rock scored and polished, generally   in lines pointing down the valleys, or at least outward from the   centre of the highlands, and polished and scored most in their upland   or weather sides.  We should find blocks of rock left behind, and   perched about on other rocks of a different kind.  We should find in   the valleys the old moraines left as vast deposits of boulder and   shingle, which would be in time sawn through and sorted over by the   rivers.  And if the sea-bottom outside were upheaved, and became dry   land, we should find on it the remains of the mud from under the   glacier, stuck full of stones and boulders iceberg-dropped.  This mud   would be often very irregularly bedded; for it would have been   disturbed by the ploughing of the icebergs, and mixed here and there   with dirt which had fallen from them.  Moreover, as the sea became   shallower and the mud-beds got awash one after the other, they would   be torn about, re-sifted, and re-shaped by currents and by tides, and   mixed with shore-sand ground out of shingle-beach, thus making   confusion worse confounded.  A few shells, of an Arctic or northern   type, would be found in it here and there.  Some would have lived   near those later beaches, some in deeper water in the ancient ooze,   wherever the iceberg had left it in peace long enough for sea-animals   to colonise and breed in it.  But the general appearance of the dried   sea-bottom would be a dreary and lifeless waste of sands, gravels,   loose boulders, and boulder-bearing clays; and wherever a boss of   bare rock still stood up, it would be found ground down, and probably   polished and scored by the ponderous icebergs which had lumbered over   it in their passage out to sea.    In a word, it would look exactly as vast tracts of the English,   Scotch, and Irish lowlands must have looked before returning   vegetation coated their dreary sands and clays with a layer of brown "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1027"],[0,"The Lone Star Ranger: A Romance of the Border (#9)"],[1,"dark skins of the men around him. It was a cadaverous face. The black  mustache hung down; a heavy lock of black hair dropped down over the  brow; deep-set, hollow, staring eyes looked out piercingly. The man had  a restless, alert, nervous manner. He put his hands on the board that  served as a bar and stared at Duane. But when he met Duane's glance he  turned hurriedly to go on serving out liquor.    \"What have you got against him?\" inquired Duane, as he sat down beside  Euchre. He asked more for something to say than from real interest. What  did he care about a mean, haunted, craven-faced criminal?    \"Wal, mebbe I'm cross-grained,\" replied Euchre, apologetically. \"Shore  an outlaw an' rustler such as me can't be touchy. But I never stole  nothin' but cattle from some rancher who never missed 'em anyway. Thet  sneak Benson--he was the means of puttin' a little girl in Bland's way.\"    \"Girl?\" queried Duane, now with real attention.    \"Shore. Bland's great on women. I'll tell you about this girl when we  get out of here. Some of the gang are goin' to be sociable, an' I can't  talk about the chief.\"    During the ensuing half-hour a number of outlaws passed by Duane and  Euchre, halted for a greeting or sat down for a moment. They were all  gruff, loud-voiced, merry, and good-natured. Duane replied civilly  and agreeably when he was personally addressed; but he refused all  invitations to drink and gamble. Evidently he had been accepted, in a  way, as one of their clan. No one made any hint of an allusion to his  affair with Bosomer. Duane saw readily that Euchre was well liked. One  outlaw borrowed money from him: another asked for tobacco.    By the time it was dark the big room was full of outlaws and Mexicans,  most of whom were engaged at monte. These gamblers, especially the  Mexicans, were intense and quiet. The noise in the place came from the  drinkers, the loungers. Duane had seen gambling-resorts--some of the  famous ones in San Antonio and El Paso, a few in border towns where  license went unchecked. But this place of Jackrabbit Benson's impressed  him as one where guns and knives were accessories to the game. To his  perhaps rather distinguishing eye the most prominent thing about the  gamesters appeared to be their weapons. On several of the tables were  piles of silver--Mexican pesos--as large and high as the crown of his  hat. There were also piles of gold and silver in United States coin.  Duane needed no experienced eyes to see that betting was heavy and that  heavy sums exchanged hands. The Mexicans showed a sterner obsession, an  intenser passion. Some of the Americans staked freely, nonchalantly,  as befitted men to whom money was nothing. These latter were manifestly  winning, for there were brother outlaws there who wagered coin with  grudging, sullen, greedy eyes. Boisterous talk and laughter among the  drinking men drowned, except at intervals, the low, brief talk of the  gamblers. The clink of coin sounded incessantly; sometimes just low,  steady musical rings; and again, when a pile was tumbled quickly, there  was a silvery crash. Here an outlaw pounded on a table with the butt of  his gun; there another noisily palmed a roll of dollars while he studied  his opponent's face. The noises, however, in Benson's den did not  contribute to any extent to the sinister aspect of the place. That  seemed to come from the grim and reckless faces, from the bent, intent  heads, from the dark lights and shades. There were bright lights,  but these served only to make the shadows. And in the shadows lurked  unrestrained lust of gain, a spirit ruthless and reckless, a something  at once suggesting lawlessness, theft, murder, and hell.    \"Bland's not here to-night,\" Euchre was saying. \"He left today on one of  his trips, takin' Alloway an' some others. But his other man, Rugg, he's  here. See him standin' with them three fellers, all close to Benson.  Rugg's the little bow-legged man with the half of his face shot off.  He's one-eyed. But he can shore see out of the one he's got. An', darn  me! there's Hardin. You know him? He's got an outlaw gang as big as  Bland's. Hardin is standin' next to Benson. See how quiet an' unassumin'  he looks. Yes, thet's Hardin. He comes here once in a while to see  Bland. They're friends, which's shore strange. Do you see thet greaser  there--the one with gold an' lace on his sombrero? Thet's Manuel, a  Mexican bandit. He's a great gambler. Comes here often to drop his coin.  Next to him is Bill Marr--the feller with the bandana round his head.  Bill rode in the other day with some fresh bullet-holes. He's been shot  more'n any feller I ever heard of. He's full of lead. Funny, because  Bill's no troublehunter, an', like me, he'd rather run than shoot. But  he's the best rustler Bland's got--a grand rider, an' a wonder with  cattle. An' see the tow-headed youngster. Thet's Kid Fuller, the kid of  Bland's gang. Fuller has hit the pace hard, an' he won't last the year  out on the border. He killed his sweetheart's father, got run out of  Staceytown, took to stealin' hosses. An' next he's here with Bland.  Another boy gone wrong, an' now shore a hard nut.\"    Euchre went on calling Duane's attention to other men, just as he  happened to glance over them. Any one of them would have been a marked  man in a respectable crowd. Here each took his place with more or less  distinction, according to the record of his past wild prowess and his  present possibilities. Duane, realizing that he was tolerated there,  received in careless friendly spirit by this terrible class of outcasts,  experienced a feeling of revulsion that amounted almost to horror.  Was his being there not an ugly dream? What had he in common with such  ruffians? Then in a flash of memory came the painful proof--he was a  criminal in sight of Texas law; he, too, was an outcast.    For the moment Duane was wrapped up in painful reflections; but Euchre's  heavy hand, clapping with a warning hold on his arm, brought him back to  outside things.    The hum of voices, the clink of coin, the loud laughter had ceased.  There was a silence that manifestly had followed some unusual word or  action sufficient to still the room. It was broken by a harsh curse and  the scrape of a bench on the floor. Some man had risen.    \"You stacked the cards, you--!\"    \"Say that twice,\" another voice replied, so different in its cool,  ominous tone from the other.    \"I'll say it twice,\" returned the first gamester, in hot haste. \"I'll  say it three times. I'll whistle it. Are you deaf? You light-fingered  gent! You stacked the cards!\"    Silence ensued, deeper than before, pregnant with meaning. For all that  Duane saw, not an outlaw moved for a full moment. Then suddenly the room  was full of disorder as men rose and ran and dived everywhere.    \"Run or duck!\" yelled Euchre, close to Duane's ear. With that he dashed  for the door. Duane leaped after him. They ran into a jostling mob.  Heavy gun-shots and hoarse yells hurried the crowd Duane was with  pell-mell out into the darkness. There they all halted, and several  peeped in at the door.    \"Who was the Kid callin'?\" asked one outlaw.    \"Bud Marsh,\" replied another.    \"I reckon them fust shots was Bud's. Adios Kid. It was comin' to him,\"  went on yet another.    \"How many shots?\"    \"Three or four, I counted.\"    \"Three heavy an' one light. Thet light one was the Kid's.38. Listen!  There's the Kid hollerin' now. He ain't cashed, anyway.\"    At this juncture most of the outlaws began to file back into the room.  Duane thought he had seen and heard enough in Benson's den for one night  and he started slowly down the walk. Presently Euchre caught up with  him.    \"Nobody hurt much, which's shore some strange,\" he said. \"The Kid--young  Fuller thet I was tellin' you about--he was drinkin' an' losin'. Lost  his nut, too, callin' Bud Marsh thet way. Bud's as straight at cards as  any of 'em. Somebody grabbed Bud, who shot into the roof. An' Fuller's  arm was knocked up. He only hit a greaser.\"        CHAPTER VI    Next morning Duane found that a moody and despondent spell had fastened  on him. Wishing to be alone, he went out and walked a trail leading  round the river bluff. He thought and thought. After a while he made out  that the trouble with him probably was that he could not resign himself  to his fate. He abhorred the possibility chance seemed to hold in store  for him. He could not believe there was no hope. But what to do appeared  beyond his power to tell.    Duane had intelligence and keenness enough to see his peril--the  danger threatening his character as a man, just as much as that which  threatened his life. He cared vastly more, he discovered, for what he  considered honor and integrity than he did for life. He saw that it was  bad for him to be alone. But, it appeared, lonely months and perhaps  years inevitably must be his. Another thing puzzled him. In the bright  light of day he could not recall the state of mind that was his at  twilight or dusk or in the dark night. By day these visitations became  to him what they really were--phantoms of his conscience. He could  dismiss the thought of them then. He could scarcely remember or believe  that this strange feat of fancy or imagination had troubled him, pained  him, made him sleepless and sick.    That morning Duane spent an unhappy hour wrestling decision out of the  unstable condition of his mind. But at length he determined to create  interest in all that he came across and so forget himself as much as  possible. He had an opportunity now to see just what the outlaw's  life really was. He meant to force himself to be curious, sympathetic,  clear-sighted. And he would stay there in the valley until its  possibilities had been exhausted or until circumstances sent him out  upon his uncertain way.    When he returned to the shack Euchre was cooking dinner.    \"Say, Buck, I've news for you,\" he said; and "]]]
