Says he, Mr. Slick, there are  some folks who think a good deal and say but little, and  they are wise folks; and there are others agin, who blart  right out whatever comes uppermost, and I guess they are  pretty considerable superfine darned fools. And with that  he turned right round, and sat down to his map and never  said another word, lookin' as mad as a hatter the whole  blessed time.          No. IX    Yankee Eating and Horse Feeding.    Did you ever heer tell of Abernethy, a British doctor?  said the Clockmaker. Frequently, said I, he was an eminent  man, and had a most extensive practice. Well, I reckon  he was a vulgar critter that, he replied, he treated the  honble. Aiden Gobble, secretary to our legation at London,  dreadful bad once; and I guess if it had been me he had  used that way, I'd a fixed his flint for him, so that  he'd think twice afore he'd fire such another shot as  that are again. I'd a made him make tracks, I guess, as  quick as a dog does a hog from a potatoe field. He'd a  found his way out of the hole in the fence a plaguy sight  quicker than he came in, I reckon. Hits manner, said I,  was certainly rather unceremonious at times, but he was  so honest, and so straightforward, that no person was,  I believe, ever seriously offended at him. IT WAS HIS  WAY. Then his way was so plague rough, continued the  Clockmaker, that he'd been the better, if it had been  hammered and mauled down smoother. I'd a levelled him as  flat as a flounder. Pray what was his offence? said I.  Bad enough you may depend. The honble. Alden Gobble was  dyspeptic, and he suffered great on easiness arter eatin,  so he gees to Abemethy for advice. What's the matter with  you, said the Doctor? jist that way, without even passing  the time o' day with him--What's the matter with you?  said he. Why, says Alden, I presume I have the Dyspepsy.  Ah! said he, I see; a Yankee swallowed more dollars and  cents than he can digest I am an American citizen, says  Alden, with great dignity, I am Secretary to our Legation  at the Court of St. James. The devil you are, said  Abernethy, then you'll soon get rid of your dyspepsy. I  don't see that are inference, said Alden, it don't follow  from what you predicate at all--it ant a natural  consequence, I guess, that a man should cease to be ill,  because he is called by the voice of a free and enlightened  people to fill an important office. (The truth is, you  could no more trap Alden than you could an Indian. He  could see other folks' trail, and made none himself; he  was a real diplomatist, and I believe our diplomatists  are allowed to be the best in the world.) But I tell you  it does follow, said the Doctor; for in the company you'll  have to keep, you'll have to eat like a Christian. It  was an everlasting pity Alden contradicted him, for he  broke out like one ravin distracted mad. I'll be d--d,  said he, if ever I saw a Yankee that did'nt bolt his food  whole like a Boa Constrictor. How the devil can you  expect to digest food, that you neither take the trouble  to dissect, nor time to masticate? It's no wonder you  lose your teeth, for you never use them; nor your digestion,  for you overload it; nor your saliva, for you expend it  on the carpets, instead of your food. Its disgusting,  its beastly. You Yankees load your stomachs as a Devonshire  man does his cart, as full as it can hold, and as fast  as he can pitch it with a dung fork, and drive off; and  then you complain that such a load of compost is too  heavy for you. Dyspepsy, eh! infernal guzzling, you mean.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Secretary of Legation, take half  the time to eat, that you do to drawl out your words,  chew your food half as much as you do your filthy tobacco,  and you'll be well in a month. I don't understand such  language, said Alden. (for he was fairly ryled, and got  his dander up, and when he shows clear grit, he looks  wicked ugly, I tell you.) I don't understand such language.  Sir: I came here to consult you professionally, and not  to be ---. Don't understand! said the Doctor, why its  plain English: but here, read my book--and he shoved a  book into his hands and left him in an instant, standing  alone in the middle of the room. If the honble. Alden  Gobble had gone right away and demanded his passports,  and returned home with the Legation, in one of our first  class frigates, (I guess the English would as soon see  pyson as one o' them are Serpents) to Washington, the  President and the people would have sustained him in it,  I guess, until an apology was offered for the insult to  the nation. I guess if it had been me, said Mr. Slick,  I'd a headed him afore he slipt out o' the door, and  pinned him up agin the wall, and made him bolt his words  again, as quick as he throw'd 'em up, for I never see'd  an Englishman that didn't cut his words as short as he  does his horse's tail, close up to the stump. It certainly  was very coarse and vulgar language, and I think, said  I, that your Secretary had just cause to be offended at  such an ungentlemanlike attack, although he showed his  good sense in treating it with the contempt it deserved,  It was plaguy lucky for the doctor, I tell you, that he  cut stick as he did, and made himself scarce, for Alden  was an ugly customer; he'd a gin him a proper scalding  --he'd a taken the bristles off his hide, as clean as  the skin of a spring shote of a pig killed at Christmas.  The Clockmaker was evidently excited by his own story,  and to indemnify himself for these remarks on his  countrymen, he indulged for some time in ridiculing the  Nova Scotians.    Do you see that are flock of colts, said he, (as we passed  one of those beautiful prairies that render the vallies  of Nova Scotia so verdant and so fertile,) well, I guess  they keep too much of that are stock. I heerd an Indian  one day ax a tavern keeper for some rum; why, Joe Spawdeeck,  said he, I reckon you have got too much already. Too much  of any thing, said Joe is not good, but too much rum is  jist enough. I guess these Blue Noses think so bout their  horses, they are fairly eat up by them, out of house and  home, and they are no good neither. They beant good saddle  horses, and they beant good draft beasts--they are jist  neither one thing nor tother. They are like the drink of  our Connecticut folks. At mowing time they use molasses  and water, nasty stuff only fit to catch flies--it spiles  good water and makes bad beer. No wonder the folks are  poor. Look at them are great dykes; well, they all go to  feed horses; and look at their grain fields on the upland;  well, they are all sowed with oats to feed horses, and  they buy their bread from us: so we feed the asses, and  they feed the horses. If I had them critters on that are  marsh, on a location of mine, I'd jist take my rifle and  shoot every one on them; the nasty yo necked, cat hammed,  heavy headed, flat eared, crooked shanked, long legged,  narrow chested, good for nothin brutes; they aint worth  their keep one winter. I vow, I wish one of these Blue  Noses, with his go-to-meetin clothes on, coat tails pinned  up behind like a leather blind of a Shay, an old spur on  one heel, and a pipe stuck through his hat band, mounted  on one of these limber timbered critters, that moves its  hind legs like a hen scratchin gravel, was sot down in  Broadway, in New York, for a sight. Lord! I think I hear  the West Point cadets a larfin at him. Who brought that  are scare-crow out of standin corn and stuck him here?  I guess that are citizen came from away down east out of  the Notch of the White Mountains. Here comes the Cholera  doctor, from Canada--not from Canada, I guess, neither,  for he don't LOOK AS IF HE HAD EVER BEEN AMONG THE RAPIDS.  If they would'nt poke fun at him its a pity. If they'd  keep less horses, and more sheep, they'd have food and  clothing, too, instead of buying both. I vow I've larfed  afore now till I have fairly wet myself a cryin, to see  one of these folks catch a horse: may be he has to go  two or three miles of an arrand. Well, down he goes on  the dyke with a bridle in one hand, and an old tin pan  in another, full of oats, to catch his beast. First he  goes to one flock of horses, and then to another, to see  if he can find his own critter. At last he gets sight on  him, and goes softly up to him, shakin of his oats, and  a coaxin him, and jist as he goes to put his hand upon  him, away he starts all head and tail, and the rest with  him: that starts another flock, and they set a third  off, and at last every troop on 'em goes, as if Old Nick  was arter them, till they amount to two or three hundred  in a drove. Well, he chases them clear across the Tantramer  marsh, seven miles good, over ditches, creeks, mire holes,  and flag ponds, and then they turn and take a fair chase  for it back again seven miles more. By this time, I  presume, they are all pretty considerably well tired,  and Blue Nose, he goes and gets up all the men folks in  the neighborhood, and catches his beast, as they do a  moose arter he is fairly run down; so he runs fourteen  miles, to ride two, because he is in a tarnation hurry.  Its e'en a most equal to eatin soup with a fork, when  you are short of time. It puts me in mind of catching  birds by sprinkling salt on their tails; its only one  horse a man can ride out of half a dozen, arter all. One  has no shoes, tother has a colt, one arnt broke, another  has a sore back, while a fifth is so etarnal cunnin, all  Cumberland could'nt catch him, till winter drives him up  to the barn for food.    Most of them are dyke marshes have what they call 'HONEY  POTS' in 'em; that is a deep hole all full of squash,  where you can't find no bottom.

But there was always no money; they never paid for  as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.    But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.    As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat  their own goods.    Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.    They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed.    When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was  unable to buy a dog licence.    \"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,\" said Pickles.    \"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a licence,  and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.\"    \"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried  in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;\" said Pickles.  \"The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home.\"    \"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9  for bacon.\"    \"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,\" replied Ginger.    \"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--Where are all the cream  crackers?\" \"You have eaten them yourself,\" replied Ginger.    Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.    They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.    \"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an  ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.\"    \"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and  four matches?\"    \"Send in all the bills again to everybody 'with compts'\" replied Ginger.    After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been  pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an  envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!    Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little  rushes.    \"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!\" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel,  \"he's only a German doll!\"    The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil  in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.    Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no  notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.    At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was  empty. The policeman had disappeared.    But the envelope remained.    \"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am  afraid it is a summons,\" said Pickles.    \"No,\" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, \"it is the rates and  taxes, L 3 19 11 3/4.\"    \"This is the last straw,\" said Pickles, \"let us close the shop.\"    They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the  neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.    Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he  pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.    Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.    The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit  immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she  continued to refuse to give credit.    Of course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fishman and  Timothy Baker.    But a person cannot live on \"seed wigs\" and sponge-cake and  butter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!    After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell  peppermints and candles.    But they did not keep \"self-fitting sixes\"; and it takes five mice to  carry one seven inch candle.    Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm  weather.    And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought  back to her with complaints.    And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and  would say nothing but \"very snug;\" which is not the way to carry on a  retail business.    So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed  poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop--\"Henny's Opening  Sale! Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come  try, come buy!\"    The poster really was most 'ticing.    There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with  customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.    Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out  change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.    And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.    There is something to please everybody.    THE END          THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET      THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!    THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of  Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.    THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits  her own head.    SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard!    THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.    MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire.    THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the  bell-pull.    MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.    MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a  hole in the duster. The Mouse comes VERY close.    AND then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!    AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she  will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.    SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball.    BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied  it--there was no Mouse!    HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of  the cupboard!    THE END        THE TALE OF MR. JEREMY FISHER    FOR STEPHANIE FROM COUSIN B.      ONCE upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in  a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.    THE water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.    But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and  he never caught a cold!    HE was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain,  splashing in the pond--    \"I WILL get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my  dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I will  invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.  The Alderman, however, eats salad.\"    MR. JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his  rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he  kept his boat.    THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It  was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.    MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. \"I  know a good place for minnows,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.    Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He  had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass,  his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little  wriggling worm at the end.    THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the  float.    \"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,\" said Mr.  Jeremy Fisher.    HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out  of his basket.    \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,\"  said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked  the toe of one of his goloshes.    Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating  his sandwich.    ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst  the rushes at the side of the pond.    \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had  better get away from here.\"    MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the  bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous  bobbit!    \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher,  jerking up his rod.    BUT what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy  landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!    THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until  he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.    AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at  Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking  his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing  happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had  not been wearing a macintosh!    A GREAT big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--and  it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned and  dived down to the bottom of the pond!    BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in  less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it  swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.    MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the  bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to  the edge of the pond.    HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across  the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.    \"WHAT a mercy that was not a pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have lost  my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should  never have dared to go fishing again!\"    HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came  to dinner. He could not offer them"]]]
