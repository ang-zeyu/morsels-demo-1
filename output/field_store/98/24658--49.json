[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/961"],[0,"Glinda of Oz (#8)"],[1,". Her Majesty is waiting  to receive you in her palace.\"    \"Lead on,\" replied Ozma with dignity.    But instead of \"leading on,\" the platform of marble began to rise,  carrying them upward through a square hole above which just fitted it.  A moment later they found themselves within the great glass dome that  covered almost all of the island.    Within this dome was a little village, with houses, streets, gardens  and parks. The houses were of colored marbles, prettily designed, with  many stained-glass windows, and the streets and gardens seemed well  cared for. Exactly under the center of the lofty dome was a small park  filled with brilliant flowers, with an elaborate fountain, and facing  this park stood a building larger and more imposing than the others.  Toward this building the young men escorted Ozma and Dorothy.    On the streets and in the doorways or open windows of the houses were  men, women and children, all richly dressed. These were much like other  people in different parts of the Land of Oz, except that instead of  seeming merry and contented they all wore expressions of much solemnity  or of nervous irritation. They had beautiful homes, splendid clothes,  and ample food, but Dorothy at once decided something was wrong with  their lives and that they were not happy. She said nothing, however,  but looked curiously at the Skeezers.    At the entrance of the palace Ozma and Dorothy were met by two other  young men, in uniform and armed with queer weapons that seemed about  halfway between pistols and guns, but were like neither. Their  conductors bowed and left them, and the two in uniforms led the girls  into the palace.    In a beautiful throne room, surrounded by a dozen or more young men and  women, sat the Queen of the Skeezers, Coo-ee-oh. She was a girl who  looked older than Ozma or Dorothy--fifteen or sixteen, at least--and  although she was elaborately dressed as if she were going to a ball she  was too thin and plain of feature to be pretty. But evidently Queen  Coo-ee-oh did not realize this fact, for her air and manner betrayed  her as proud and haughty and with a high regard for her own importance.  Dorothy at once decided she was \"snippy\" and that she would not like  Queen Coo-ee-oh as a companion.    The Queen's hair was as black as her skin was white and her eyes were  black, too. The eyes, as she calmly examined Ozma and Dorothy, had a  suspicious and unfriendly look in them, but she said quietly:    \"I know who you are, for I have consulted my Magic Oracle, which told  me that one calls herself Princess Ozma, the Ruler of all the Land of  Oz, and the other is Princess Dorothy of Oz, who came from a country  called Kansas. I know nothing of the Land of Oz, and I know nothing of  Kansas.\"    \"Why, this is the Land of Oz!\" cried Dorothy. \"It's a part of the Land  of Oz, anyhow, whether you know it or not.\"    \"Oh, in-deed!\" answered Queen Coo-ee-oh, scornfully. \"I suppose you  will claim next that this Princess Ozma, ruling the Land of Oz, rules  me!\"    \"Of course,\" returned Dorothy. \"There's no doubt of it.\"    The Queen turned to Ozma.    \"Do you dare make such a claim?\" she asked.    By this time Ozma had made up her mind as to the character of this  haughty and disdainful creature, whose self-pride evidently led her to  believe herself superior to all others.    \"I did not come here to quarrel with your Majesty,\" said the girl Ruler  of Oz, quietly. \"What and who I am is well established, and my  authority comes from the Fairy Queen Lurline, of whose band I was a  member when Lurline made all Oz a Fairyland. There are several  countries and several different peoples in this broad land, each of  which has its separate rulers, Kings, Emperors and Queens. But all  these render obedience to my laws and acknowledge me as the supreme  Ruler.\"    \"If other Kings and Queens are fools that does not interest me in the  least,\" replied Coo-ee-oh, disdainfully. \"In the Land of the Skeezers I  alone am supreme. You are impudent to think I would defer to you--or to  anyone else.\"    \"Let us not speak of this now, please,\" answered Ozma. \"Your island is  in danger, for a powerful foe is preparing to destroy it.\"    \"Pah! The Flatheads. I do not fear them.\"    \"Their Supreme Dictator is a Sorcerer.\"    \"My magic is greater than his. Let the Flatheads come! They will never  return to their barren mountain-top. I will see to that.\"    Ozma did not like this attitude, for it meant that the Skeezers were  eager to fight the Flatheads, and Ozma's object in coming here was to  prevent fighting and induce the two quarrelsome neighbors to make  peace. She was also greatly disappointed in Coo-ee-oh, for the reports  of Su-dic had led her to imagine the Queen more just and honorable than  were the Flatheads. Indeed Ozma reflected that the girl might be better  at heart than her self-pride and overbearing manner indicated, and in  any event it would be wise not to antagonize her but to try to win her  friendship.    \"I do not like wars, your Majesty,\" said Ozma. \"In the Emerald City,  where I rule thousands of people, and in the countries near to the  Emerald City, where thousands more acknowledge my rule, there is no  army at all, because there is no quarreling and no need to fight. If  differences arise between my people, they come to me and I judge the  cases and award justice to all. So, when I learned there might be war  between two faraway people of Oz, I came here to settle the dispute and  adjust the quarrel.\"    \"No one asked you to come,\" declared Queen Coo-ee-oh. \"It is my  business to settle this dispute, not yours. You say my island is a part  of the Land of Oz, which you rule, but that is all nonsense, for I've  never heard of the Land of Oz, nor of you. You say you are a fairy, and  that fairies gave you command over me. I don't believe it! What I do  believe is that you are an impostor and have come here to stir up  trouble among my people, who are already becoming difficult to manage.  You two girls may even be spies of the vile Flatheads, for all I know,  and may be trying to trick me. But understand this,\" she added, proudly  rising from her jeweled throne to confront them, \"I have magic powers  greater than any fairy possesses, and greater than any Flathead  possesses. I am a Krumbic Witch--the only Krumbic Witch in the  world--and I fear the magic of no other creature that exists! You say  you rule thousands. I rule one hundred and one Skeezers. But every one  of them trembles at my word. Now that Ozma of Oz and Princess Dorothy  are here, I shall rule one hundred and three subjects, for you also  shall bow before my power. More than that, in ruling you I also rule  the thousands you say you rule.\"    Dorothy was very indignant at this speech.    \"I've got a pink kitten that sometimes talks like that,\" she said, \"but  after I give her a good whipping she doesn't think she's so high and  mighty after all. If you only knew who Ozma is you'd be scared to death  to talk to her like that!\"    Queen Coo-ee-oh gave the girl a supercilious look. Then she turned  again to Ozma.    \"I happen to know,\" said she, \"that the Flatheads intend to attack us  tomorrow, but we are ready for them. Until the battle is over, I shall  keep you two strangers prisoners on my island, from which there is no  chance for you to escape.\"    She turned and looked around the band of courtiers who stood silently  around her throne.    \"Lady Aurex,\" she continued, singling out one of the young women, \"take  these children to your house and care for them, giving them food and  lodging. You may allow them to wander anywhere under the Great Dome,  for they are harmless. After I have attended to the Flatheads I will  consider what next to do with these foolish girls.\"    She resumed her seat and the Lady Aurex bowed low and said in a humble  manner:    \"I obey your Majesty's commands.\" Then to Ozma and Dorothy she added,  \"Follow me,\" and turned to leave the throne room.    Dorothy looked to see what Ozma would do. To her surprise and a little  to her disappointment Ozma turned and followed Lady Aurex. So Dorothy  trailed after them, but not without giving a parting, haughty look  toward Queen Coo-ee-oh, who had her face turned the other way and did  not see the disapproving look.          Chapter Nine    Lady Aurex      Lady Aurex led Ozma and Dorothy along a street to a pretty marble house  near to one edge of the great glass dome that covered the village. She  did not speak to the girls until she had ushered them into a pleasant  room, comfortably furnished, nor did any of the solemn people they met  on the street venture to speak.    When they were seated Lady Aurex asked if they were hungry, and finding  they were summoned a maid and ordered food to be brought.    This Lady Aurex looked to be about twenty years old, although in the  Land of Oz where people have never changed in appearance since the  fairies made it a fairyland--where no one grows old or dies--it is  always difficult to say how many years anyone has lived. She had a  pleasant, attractive face, even though it was solemn and sad as the  faces of all Skeezers seemed to be, and her costume was rich and  elaborate, as became a lady in waiting upon the Queen.    Ozma had observed Lady Aurex closely and now asked her in a gentle tone:    \"Do you, also, believe me to be an impostor?\"    \"I dare not say,\" replied Lady Aurex in a low tone.    \"Why are you afraid to speak freely?\" inquired Ozma.    \"The Queen punishes us if we make remarks that she does not like.\"    \"Are we not alone then, in this house?\"    \"The Queen can hear everything that is spoken on this island--even the  slightest whisper,\" declared Lady Aurex. \"She is a wonderful witch, as  she has told you, and it is folly to criticise her or disobey her  commands.\"    Ozma looked into her eyes and saw that she would like to say more if  she dared. So she drew from her bosom her silver wand,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],[0,"The Botanic Garden (#8)"],[1,"o'er his knee the triple bolt He bent,       The cluster'd darts and forky arrows rent,       Snapp'd with illumin'd hands each flaming shaft,       His tingling fingers shook, and stamp'd, and laugh'd;  395  Bright o'er the floor the scatter'd fragments blaz'd,       And Gods retreating trembled as they gaz'd;       The immortal Sire, indulgent to his child,       Bow'd his ambrosial locks, and Heaven relenting smiled.      [_You led your Franklin_. l. 383. Dr. Franklin was the first that  discovered that lightening consisted of electric matter, he elevated a  tall rod with a wire wrapped round it, and fixing the bottom of a rod  into a glass bottle, and preserving it from falling by means of silk-  strings, he found it electrified whenever a cloud parted over it,  receiving sparks by his finger from it, and charging coated phials. This  great discovery taught us to defend houses and ships and temples from  lightning, and also to understand, _that people are always perfectly  safe in a room during a thunder storm if they keep themselves at three  or four feet distance from the walls_; for the matter of lightning in  passing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds,  runs through the walls of a house, the trunk of a tree, or other  elevated object; except there be some moister body, as an animal in  contact with them, or nearly so; and in that case the lightning leaves  the wall or tree, and passes through the animal; but as it can pass  through metals with still greater facility, it will leave animal bodies  to pass through metallic ones.    If a person in the open air be surprized by a thunderstorm, he will know  his danger by observing on a second watch the time which passes between  the flash and the crack, and reckoning a mile for every four seconds and  a half, and a little more. For sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet in  a second of time, and the velocity of light through such small distances  is not to be estimated. In these circumstances a person will be safer by  lying down on the ground, than erect, and still safer if within a few  feet of his horse; which being then a more elevated animal will receive  the shock, in preference as the cloud passes over.

It is expressed on an agate in the Great Duke's collection  at Florence.

You swell the bulb beneath the heaving lawn,       Brood the live seed, unfold the bursting spawn;       Nurse with soft lap, and warm with fragrant breath  410  The embryon panting in the arms of Death;       Youth's vivid eye with living light adorn,       And fire the rising blush of Beauty's golden morn.      [_Transient heat dispart_. l. 401. Dr. Crawford in his ingenious work on  animal heat has endeavoured to prove, that during the combination of the  pure part of the atmosphere with the phlogistic part of the blood, that  much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air; and that this  is the great and perpetual source of the heat of animals; to which we  may add that the phosphoric acid is probably produced by this  combination; by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the  lungs from a deep crimson to a bright scarlet. There seems to be however  another source of animal heat, though of a similar nature; and that is  from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands; since by  whatever cause any glandular secretion is increased, as by friction or  topical imflammation, the heat of that part becomes increased at the  same time; thus after the hands have been for a time immersed in snow,  on coming into a warm room, they become red and hot, without any  increased pulmonary action. BESIDES THIS there would seem to be another  material received from the air by respiration; which is so necessary to  life, that the embryon must learn to breathe almost within a minute  after  its birth, or it dies. The perpetual necessity of breathing shews, that  the material thus acquired is perpetually consuming or escaping, and on  that account requires perpetual renovation. Perhaps the spirit of  animation itself is thus acquired from the atmosphere, which if it be  supposed to be finer or more subtle than the electric matter, could not  long be retained in our bodies, and must therefore require perpetual  renovation.]             \"Thus when the Egg of Night, on Chaos hurl'd,       Burst, and disclosed the cradle of the world;  415  First from the gaping shell refulgent sprung       IMMORTAL LOVE, his bow celestial strung;--       O'er the wide waste his gaudy wings unfold,       Beam his soft smiles, and wave his curls of gold;--       With silver darts He pierced the kindling frame,  420  And lit with torch divine the ever-living flame.\"      [_Thus when the egg of Night_. l. 413. There were two Cupids belonging  to the antient mythology, one much elder than the other. The elder  cupid, or Eros, or divine Love, was the first that came out of the great  egg of night, which floated in Chaos, and was broken by the horns of the  celestial bull, that is, was hatched by the warmth of the spring. He was  winged and armed, and by his arrows and torch pierced and vivified all  things, producing life and joy. Bacon, Vol. V. p. 197. Quarto edit.  Lond. 1778. \"At this time, (says Aristophanes,) sable-winged night  produced an egg, from whence sprung up like a blossom Eros, the lovely,  the desirable, with his glossy golden wings.\" Avibus. Bryant's  Mythology, Vol. II. p. 350. second edition. This interesting moment of  this sublime allegory Mrs. Cosway has chosen for her very beautiful  painting. She has represented Eros or divine Love with large wings  having the strength of the eagle's wings, and the splendor of the  peacocks, with his hair floating in the form of flame, and with a halo  of light vapour round his head; which illuminates the painting; while he  is in the act of springing forwards, and with his hands separating the  elements.]             IX. The GODDESS paused, admired with conscious pride       The effulgent legions marshal'd by her side,       Forms sphered in fire with trembling light array'd,       Ens without weight, and substance without shade;  425  And, while tumultuous joy her bosom warms,       Waves her white hand, and calls her hosts to arms,           \"Unite, ILLUSTRIOUS NYMPHS! your radiant powers,       Call from their long repose the VERNAL HOURS.       Wake with soft touch, with rosy hands unbind  430  The struggling pinions of the WESTERN WIND;       Chafe his wan cheeks, his ruffled plumes repair,       And wring the rain-drops from his tangled hair.       Blaze round each frosted rill, or stagnant wave,       And charm the NAIAD from her silent cave;  435  Where, shrined in ice, like NIOBE she mourns,       And clasps with hoary arms her empty urns.

[_Of the Western Wind_. l. 430. The principal frosts of this country are  accompanied or produced by a N.E. wind, and the thaws by a S.W. wind;  the reason of which is that the N.E. winds consist of regions of air  brought from the north, which appear to acquire an easterly direction as  they advance; and the S.W. winds consist of regions of air brought from  the south, which appear to acquire a westerly direction as they advance.  The surface of the earth nearer the pole moves slower than it does in  our latitude; whence the regions of air brought from thence, move  slower, when they arrive hither, than the earth's surface with which  they now become in contact; that is they acquire an apparent easterly  direction, as the earth moves from west to east faster than this new  part of its atmosphere. The S.W. winds on the contrary consist of  regions of air brought from the south, where the surface of the earth  moves faster than in our latitude; and have therefore a westerly  direction when they arrive hither by their moving faster than the  surface of the earth, with which they are in contact; and in general the  nearer to the west and the greater the velocity of these winds the  warmer they should be in respect to the season of the year, since they  have been brought more expeditiously from the south, than those winds  which have less westerly direction, and have thence been less cooled in  their passage.    Sometimes I have observed the thaw to commence immediately on the change  of the wind, even within an hour, if I am not mistaken, or sooner. At  other times the S.W. wind has continued a day, or even two, before the  thaw has commenced; during which time some of the frosty air, which had  gone southwards, is driven back over us; and in consequence has taken a  westerly direction, as well as a southern one. At other times I have  observed a frost with a N.E. wind every morning, and a thaw with a S.W.  wind every noon for several days together.
