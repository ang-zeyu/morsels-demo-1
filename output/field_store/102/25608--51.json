Talk about your bundle trust--Gran had the market cornered.\"    \"Well, why shouldn't I have?\" demanded Grantham. \"Haven't I got five of  the finest kids that ever climbed a Christmas tree?\"    \"Nope,\" said Dobbleigh, with an air of conviction. \"Your five are  dandies, Gran, but you ought to see my six.\"    \"I've seen 'em,\" said Grantham, \"and I'll give every blessed one of 'em  honorable mention as high-steppers and thoroughbreds, but when it comes  to the real thing--well, my five are blue-ribbon kids all right, all  right.\"    \"How you fathers do brag about little things!\" snorted Ricketts. \"You  two braggarts can roll your eleven into one, and the aggregate wouldn't  be a marker to what my children would be if I had any. I've half a mind  to give up my state of single blessedness, just to show you vainglorious  chaps what--\"    Just what Ricketts was going to show the assembled gathering the world  will never be able to do more than guess, for he was not permitted to  finish the sentence. It was at this precise point that Doctor Mallerby,  shedding snow from his broad, burly figure at every step, staggered into  the room, and, with a scant greeting to his friends, hastened to the  blazing log fire on the club hearth, and kneeling before it, began  unwrapping a bundle of some size that he, too, carried in his arms.    \"What on earth have you got there, doctor?\" cried Ricketts, craning his  neck over the newcomer's shoulder. \"One of these new character dolls?\"    \"No, Billie, no,\" said Mallerby, fumbling away at the bundle. \"I wish to  Heaven it were. Can't you see, old man--it's the real thing!\"    \"The real what?\" said Ricketts, bending lower.    \"The real thing,\" returned Mallerby, in a low voice. \"A poor little tot  of a newsboy--\"    \"Where on earth did you pick him up?\" gasped Ricketts, as the others  gathered around.    \"Out of the storm,\" said Mallerby. \"I found him huddled up in the  vestibule of Colonel Mortimer's when I came out of the house ten minutes  ago. The poor little devil was curled up almost into a knot, trying to  keep warm, and lay there fast asleep, with his papers under his arm. I  honestly believe that if I hadn't come out when I did it would have been  too late. This is a fierce storm.\"    \"He isn't--he isn't frozen, is he?\" faltered Dobbleigh, as he gazed into  the blue little face of the unconscious urchin, a face grimy with the  frequent mixture of two dirty little fists and his tears.    \"Not quite,\" said Mallerby. \"I think I got him in time, and he'll pull  through, but he had a mighty close call of it. By George, boys, just  think of a wee bit of a tot like that, barely more than six years old,  having to be out on a night like this! Why, the poor little cuss ought  to be dreaming of Santa Claus in a nice warm bed somewhere, instead of  picking pennies out of these arctic streets of ours, in order to keep  body and soul together.\"    Warmed by the glow of the fire, the youngster stirred as the doctor  spoke, and a weary little voice, scarce higher than a whisper, broke the  stillness of the room:    \"Extree! Bigges' blizzid in twenty years. Extree! Piper, sir?\"    The seven sophisticated men of the world, gathered about the prostrate  figure, stood silent, and three of them turned away, lest the others  should see the unmanly moisture of their eyes.    \"Here, by thunder!\" gasped Ricketts, pulling a roll of bills from his  pocket. \"Hanged if I won't buy the whole edition.\"    \"That's all right, Billie,\" smiled the doctor. \"What he needs just now  is something less cold than money. We'll take him upstairs, and give him  a warm bath, fill his little stomach up with milk, and put him to bed,  with a nice fuzzy blanket to thaw out his icy little legs.\"    \"Splendid!\" said Ricketts. \"But, see here, doctor, I want to be in on  this. Isn't there anything I can do to help?\"    \"Yes,\" said the doctor. \"You might make this proceeding regular by  putting him up as your guest on a ten-day card.\"    The little bundle of rags and humanity was tenderly carried to the  regions above, and under the almost womanly ministrations of Doctor  Mallerby was completely restored to cleanliness and warmth; what hunger  he might have been conscious of was assuaged by a great bumper of milk,  and then in the most sumptuous apartment the club was able to provide  the thawed-out little gamin was put to bed.    The snowy sheets, the soft, downy pillows, and the soul-warming  blankets, were not needed to lure him into the land of dreams, for the  bitter experiences of the earlier hours of the night still weighed  heavily upon his eyelids, even if his mind and heart were no longer  conscious of them. He presented a most appealing picture as he lay  there, after settling back with a deep-drawn sigh of content into the  kindly embrace of a bed seven or eight sizes too big for him, his little  legs scarcely reaching halfway to the middle, and his tousled head of  red hair forming a rubricated spot on the milk-white pillow-case as it  stuck up out of the bed-clothes, and lay comfortably back in what was  probably the first soft nest it had known since it lay on its mother's  breast--if, indeed, it had ever known that rare felicity.    \"There,\" said the doctor, as the little foundling, with a suspicion of  a smile on his pursed-up lips, wandered more deeply into the land of  Nod. \"I guess he's fixed for the night, anyhow, and the rest of us can  go about our business.\"    The seven men tiptoed softly out of the room, and adjourned to the  spacious chambers below, where for an hour they tried to lose themselves  in the chaos of bridge. They were all fairly expert players at that  noble social obsession, but nobody would have guessed it that night. No  party of beginners ever played quite so atrociously, and yet no partner  was found sufficiently outraged to be acrimonious. The fact was that not  one of them was able to keep his mind on the cards, the thoughts of  every one of them reverting constantly to the wan little figure in that  upper room.    Finally Dobbleigh, after having reneged twice, and trumped his partner's  trick more than once, threw down his cards, and drew away from the table  impatiently.    \"It's no use, fellows,\" he said. \"I can't keep my eye on the ball. I'm  going to bed.\"    \"Same here,\" said Ricketts. \"Every blessed face card in this  pack--queen, king, or jack--is a red-headed little newsboy to me, and  every spade is a heart. It's me for Slumberland.\"    So the party broke up, and within an hour the clubhouse went dark.  Doctor Mallerby assumed possession of a single room adjoining that of  their little guest, so that he might keep an eye upon his newly  acquired patient through the night, and the others distributed  themselves about on the upper floors.    At midnight all was still as a sylvan dell in the depths of a winter's  night, when no sounds of birds, or of rustling leaves, or of babbling  waters break in upon the quiet of the scene.           *       *       *       *       *    It was three o'clock in the morning when Doctor Mallerby was roused  suddenly from his sleep by the sound of stealthy footsteps in the  adjoining room, where the little sleeper lay. He rose hastily from his  couch, and entered the room, and was much surprised to see, in the dim  light of the hall lamp, no less a person than Dobbleigh, acting rather  suspiciously, too.    \"Hullo, what are you up to, Dobby?\" he queried, in a low whisper, as he  espied that worthy, clad in a bath robe of too ample proportions,  stealing out of the room.    \"Why--nothing, Mallerby, nothing,\" replied Dobbleigh, evidently much  embarrassed. \"I--er--I just thought I'd run down, and see how the little  chap was getting along. I'm something of a father myself, you know.\"    \"What's all this?\" continued the doctor, as his eye fell upon a number  of strange-looking objects spread along the foot of the bed, far beyond  the reach of the little toes of the sleeper--a book of rhymes with a  gorgeous red cover; a small tin trumpet, with a pleasing variety of  stops; a box of tin soldiers; and a complete rough-rider's outfit,  sword, cap, leggings, and blouse; not to mention an assortment of other  things well calculated to delight the soul of youth.    \"Why,\" faltered Dobbleigh, his face turning as red as the flag of  anarchy, \"you see, I happened to have these things along with me,  Mallerby--for my own kiddies, you know--and it sort of seemed a pity not  to get some use out of them on Christmas morning, and so--Oh, well, you  know, old man.\"    The hand of the doctor gripped that of the intruder, and he tried to  assure him that he did know, but he couldn't. He choked up, and was  about to turn away when the door began moving slowly upon its hinges  once more, and Grantham entered, quite as much after the fashion of the  stealthy-footed criminal as Dobbleigh. He, too, carried a variety of  packages, and under each arm was a tightly packed golf stocking. He  started back as he saw Dobbleigh and the doctor standing by the bedside,  but it was too late. They had caught him in the act.    \"Ah, Grantham,\" said Dobbleigh, with a grin. \"Giving an imitation of a  second-story man, eh? What are you going to do with those two stuffed  clubs? Sandbag somebody?\"    \"Yes,\" said Grantham sheepishly. \"I've had it in for the doctor for  some time, and I thought I'd sneak down and give him one while he  slept.\"    \"All right, Granny,\" smiled the doctor. \"Just hang your clubs on the  foot of the bed here, and after I've got to sleep again, come in, and  perpetrate the dastardly deed.\"    \"Fact is, boys,\" said Grantham seriously, \"these things I was taking  home to my youngsters are going to waste under the circumstances, and I  had an idea it wouldn't hurt our guest here to wake up just once to a  real Santa Claus feast.\"    \"Fine!\" said the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#9)"],[1,"of cities  and of galleries; and by the example of Homer, Cicero, and most great  writers; Homer himself commemorating, along with the wise and brave also  the less valiant--the fools and the cowards. (_Elogio_, pp. 129, 130,  131.)    After having resided during a considerable period at Bassano, occupied  in the superintendence of the first edition of his great work, Lanzi  found himself compelled to retire to Udine, in 1796, from the more  immediate scene of war; a war which subsequently involved other cities  of Italy in its career. From Udine he shortly returned to Florence,  where he again resumed his former avocations in the ducal gallery, about  the period of the commencement of the Bourbon government.    Lanzi's next literary undertaking was three Dissertations upon _Ancient  painted Vases, commonly called Etruscan_; and he subsequently published  a very excellent and pleasing work, entitled, _Aloisii Lanzii  Inscriptionum et Carminum Libri Tres_: works which obtained for him the  favourable notice of the Bourbon court. Nor was he less distinguished by  that of the new French dynasty, which shortly obtained the ascendancy  throughout all Italy, as well as at Florence, and by which Lanzi was  appointed President of the Cruscan Academy.    Among Lanzi's latest productions may be classed his edition and  translations of Hesiod; entitled _I Lavori, e le Giornate di Esiodo  Ascreo opera con L. Codici riscontrata, emendata la versione latina,  aggiuntavi l'Italiana in Terze Rime con annotazioni_. In this he had  been engaged as far back as the year 1785, and it had been then  announced in a beautiful edition of Hesiod, translated into Latin by  Count Zamagua.    The list will here close with his _Opere Sacre_, sacred treatises,  produced on a variety of occasions, and on a variety of spiritual  subjects. One of these was upon the Holy Sacrament, entitled, _Il divoto  del SS. Sacramento istruito nella pratica_ _di tal devozione_. In truth,  Lanzi was a good Christian, and may be ranked in the number of that  great and honoured band of Christian philosophers, who like Newton,  Locke, and Paley, have triumphantly opposed the whole strength of their  mighty intellect, and vast reach of their reasoning powers to the  specious and witty, but less powerful and argumentative genius of  Gibbon, of Hume, and of Voltaire. Nor was the conviction of these great  truths in the mind of Lanzi the result of sickness and misfortunes, or  sombre reflections in the decline of life. Great as was the reputation  he had acquired by his valuable labours, he was often known sincerely to  declare, among his private friends, that he would willingly renounce all  kind of literary honours for the pleasure of being assured, that his  sacred works had in any degree promoted the cause of Christianity.    Shortly after the last edition of the History now before us, which he  had personally superintended, though at a very advanced age, in the year  1809, at Bassano, Lanzi's health began rapidly to decline, and he  prepared with perfect composure to meet the termination of his earthly  career. He had already attained his seventy-eighth year; but his mind  preserved its usual tone and vigour, though he could with difficulty  pace his apartment. He wrote letters, and even pursued his beloved  studies on the day of his decease, which took place on Sunday, the 30th  of March, 1810, occasioned by a fresh attack of apoplexy. For this he  had long been prepared, and only the preceding evening had taken an  affectionate leave of his friends and domestics, thanking the Cav. Boni  for his kindness in continuing so long to mount his staircase to visit  an old man.      [Footnote 24: It may be proper to observe, that the materials of the  biographical sketch here offered to the public, are extracted from an  extremely pleasing and popular tribute to the memory of Lanzi, of very  general repute in Italy, from the pen of his intimate friend and  associate, the Cavalier Bossi, himself a man of singular merit and  acquirements, whose _Elogio_ upon his distinguished countryman has  deservedly been added to the recent editions of his invaluable history.]    [Footnote 25: Repeated attacks of strangury which often threatened his  life, unless he obtained instant relief.]            HISTORY OF PAINTING      IN      LOWER ITALY.

EPOCH I.      _Origin of the revival of Painting_--_Association and    methods of the old Painters_--_Series of Tuscan Artists    before the time of Cimabue and Giotto._      SECT. I.      That there were painters in Italy, even during the rude ages, is  attested not only by historians,[26] but by several pictures which have  escaped the ravages of time; Rome retains several ancient specimens.[27]  Passing over her cemeteries, which have handed down to us a number of  Christian monuments, part in specimens of painted glass, scattered  through our museums, and part in those of parietal histories, or walled  mosaic, it will be sufficient to adduce two vast works, unrivalled by  any others, that I know of, in Italy. The first is the series of the  Popes, which in order to prove the succession of the papal chair, from  the prince of the Apostles down to the time of St. Leo, this last holy  pontiff caused to be painted; a work of the fifth century, which was  subsequently continued until our own times. The second is the decoration  of the whole church of San Urbano, where there are several evangelical  acts represented on the walls, along with some histories of the Titular  Saint and St. Cecilia, a production which, partaking in nothing either  of the Greek lineaments or style of drapery, may be attributed more  justly to an Italian pencil, which has subscribed the date of 1011.[28]  Many more might be pointed out, existing in different cities; as for  instance the picture at Pesara, of the patron saints of the city,  illustrated by the celebrated Annibale Olivieri, which is earlier than  the year 1000; those in the vaults of the cathedral at Aquileja,[29] the  picture at Santa Maria Primerana at Fiesole, which seems the work of  that or the succeeding age;[30] and the picture at Orvieto which was  formerly known by the name of S. Maria Prisca, but is now generally  called S. Brizio.[31] I say nothing of the figures of the virgin  formerly ascribed to St. Luke, and now supposed to be the production of  the eleventh or twelfth century, as I shall have to treat of them at the  opening of the third book. The painters of those times were, however, of  little repute; they produced no illustrious scholars, no work worthy of  marking an era. The art had gradually degenerated into a kind of  mechanism, which, after the models afforded by the Greek workers in  mosaic employed in the church of St. Mark, at Venice,[32] invariably  exhibited the same legends, in which nature appeared distorted rather  than represented. It was not till after the middle of the thirteenth  century that any thing better was attempted; and the improvement of  sculpture was the first step towards the formation of a new style.    The honour of this is due to the Tuscans; a nation that from very remote  antiquity disseminated the benign light of art and learning throughout  Italy; but it more especially belongs to the people of Pisa. They taught  artists how to shake off the trammels of the modern Greeks, and to adopt  the ancients for their models. Barbarism had not only overwhelmed the  arts, but even the maxims necessary for their re-establishment. Italy  was not destitute of fine specimens of Grecian and Roman sculpture; but  she had long been without an artist who could appreciate their value,  much less attempt to imitate them. Little else was executed in those  dark ages but some rude pieces of sculpture, such as what remains in the  cathedral of Modena, in San Donato at Arezzo, in the Primaziale at  Pisa,[33] and in some other churches where specimens are preserved on  the doors or in the interior. Niccola Pisano was the first who  discovered and pursued the true path. There were, and still are, some  ancient sarcophagi in Pisa, especially that which inclosed the body of  Beatrice, mother of the Countess Matilda, who died in the eleventh  century. A chase, supposed to represent that of Hippolytus, is  sculptured on it in basso relievo, which must be the production of a  good school; being a subject which has been often delineated by the  ancients on many urns still extant at Rome.[34] This was the model which  Niccola selected, from this he formed a style which participated of the  antique, especially in the heads and the casting of the drapery; and  when exhibited in different Italian cities \"it inspired artists with a  laudable emulation to apply to sculpture more assiduously than they had  before done,\" as we are informed by Vasari. Niccola did not attain to  what he aspired. The compositions are sometimes crowded, the figures are  often badly designed, and shew more diligence than expression. His name,  however, will always mark an era in the history of design, because he  first led artists into the true path by the introduction of a better  standard. Reform in any branch of study invariably depends on some rule,  which, promulgated and adopted by the schools, gradually produces a  general revolution in opinion, and opens a new field to the exertions of  a succeeding age.    About 1231, he sculptured at Bologna the urn of San Domenico, and from  this, as a remarkable event, he was named \"_Niccola of the Urn_.\" He  afterwards executed in a much superior style, the Last Judgment, for the  cathedral of Orvieto, and the pulpit in the church of San Giovanni, at  Pisa; works that demonstrate to the world that design, invention, and  composition, received from him a new existence. He was succeeded by  Arnolfo Florentino, his scholar, the sculptor of the tomb of Boniface  VIII. in San Pietro at Rome; and by"]]]
