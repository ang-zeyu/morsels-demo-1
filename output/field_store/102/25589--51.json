Many kinds of predatory mammals, hawks, owls, and snakes  probably take woodrats occasionally, but the spotted skunk, long-tailed  weasel, horned owl, timber rattlesnake and pilot black snake are  considered to be by far the most important predators because of their  habits and prey preferences. Few actual records of predation on woodrats  were obtained because of their scarcity during most of the period  covered by our study.    Of the animals which share the woodrat's habitat, many small mammals,  reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates use its houses and live in a  somewhat commensal relationship.    Woodrats are somewhat territorial, each defending its house and an  indefinite surrounding area against intrusion by others. Houses tend to  be spaced at intervals of at least 40 feet; occasionally they are closer  together. Most foraging for food is done within 75 feet of the house.  However, woodrats often wander far beyond the limits of the usual home  range. On the average, males travel more frequently and more widely than  females, and the larger and older males travel more than the smaller and  younger. Search for mates provides the chief motivation for wandering.  Extent of wandering is controlled to a large degree by availability of  natural travelways, such as rock ledges, by shelters for temporary  stopping places, such as old deserted houses, and by population density  of the rats themselves.    Food of the eastern woodrat consists chiefly of vegetation; many kinds  of leaves, fruits, and seeds are eaten. For many individuals foliage and  seeds of the osage orange are the staple; hedge rows and dense trees of  osage orange provide favorable sites for the houses. Woodrats are  attracted to meat baits, and have been known to feed on flesh of  carcasses, even on one of the pilot black snake which is a predator on  the rat.    Woodrats are born blind, naked, and helpless, at a weight approximately  four per cent of the adult female's. They gain at a rate of at least 1.5  grams per day in the first two months. When they have reached a weight  of 100 grams, the gain averages somewhat less than one gram per day, but  individual variation is great. Males gain more rapidly than females,  especially in the later stages of growth, as adult weight is greater by  approximately one-fourth in the male. Some individuals grow to maximum  adult size at an age of one year. Unusually large individuals are not  necessarily those that are unusually old. Longevity is greater in  woodrats than in most smaller rodents. One female of adult size when  first trapped was last captured 991 days later when she must have been  well over three years old, and others are known to have survived more  than two years even though populations were shrinking so that few of the  rats were able to survive for their normal life span.          _Literature Cited_      CRABB, W.

He will go mooning away among  the natives, and will be getting lost and not heard of for a tremendous  time. Still, I don't know that he will come to much harm. The Maoris  have fine traits of character, and though they have been fighting about  what they call the king question, they have seldom been guilty of any  acts of hostility to isolated settlers, and a single white man going  among them has always been received hospitably; besides, they will  probably think him mad, and savages have always a sort of respect for  madmen. Still, he will be a terrible worry to his family. I have taken a  fancy to the others, and if I can do them a good turn out there in any  way I will.\"    As the voyage went on Mr. Atherton's liking for Mrs. Renshaw, her son  and daughter, increased greatly, while his contempt for Mr. Renshaw  became modified as he came to know him better. He found that he was  really a capable man in his own particular hobby, and that although weak  and indecisive he was very kind and affectionate with his wife and  children, and reposed an almost childlike confidence in his wife's good  sense.    Madeira had been sighted lying like a great cloud on the horizon, and  indeed the young Renshaws had difficulty when they came up on deck in  the morning in believing that it was really land they saw. No stay was  made here, nor did they catch a glimpse of the Canary Islands, being too  far to the west to see even the lofty peak of Teneriffe. The first time  the ship dropped anchor was at St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verde  Islands; here they took in a supply of fresh water, meat, and  vegetables. The passengers all landed, but were much disappointed with  the sandy and uninteresting island, and it was no consolation for them  to learn from the captain that parts of the island were much more  fertile, although the vegetables and fruit came for the most part from  the other islands. \"Now,\" he said, \"if all goes well you will see no  land again till you get to Rio. We shall keep to the east of St. Paul,  and unless we get blown out of our course we shall not go near  Ascension.\"    As the wind continued favourable the ship kept her course, and at twelve  o'clock one day the captain, after taking his observations, told them  that he expected to be in Rio on the following evening. The next morning  when they came up on deck land was in sight, and in the evening they  dropped anchor in the harbour of Rio, one of the finest ports in the  world.    \"Yes, it is a splendid harbour,\" Mr. Atherton agreed as he listened to  the exclamations of delight of the Renshaws. \"I do not know that it is  the finest, but it is certainly equal to any I have ever seen. As a  harbour New York is better, because even more landlocked. San Francisco  is, both in that respect and in point of scenery, superb. Bombay is a  grand harbour, but exposed to certain winds. Taken altogether, I think I  should give the palm to San Francisco.\"    A few minutes after the anchor had dropped a number of shore-boats came  alongside filled with luscious fruit, and rowed for the most part by  negroes, who chatted and shouted and gesticulated, making such a din  that it was impossible to distinguish a single word amid the uproar.  Wilfrid, the Allens, and others quickly ran down the ladders, and  without troubling themselves to bargain returned with quantities of  fruit. Several negresses soon followed them on to the deck, and going up  to the ladies produced cards and letters testifying that they were good  washerwomen and their terms reasonable. The captain had the evening  before told them it would take him three or four days to discharge his  cargo for Rio, and that they had better take advantage of the  opportunity if they wanted any washing done. They had, therefore, got  everything in readiness, and in a few minutes numerous canvas bags  filled with linen were deposited in the boats.    In addition to the fruit several great bouquets of gorgeous flowers had  been purchased, and the cabin that evening presented quite a festive  appearance. After it became dark and the lights of Rio sparkled out, all  agreed that the scene was even more beautiful than by daylight. The air  was deliciously balmy and soft, the sea as smooth as glass. The moon was  nearly full, and the whole line of the shore could be distinctly seen.  Boats flitted about between the vessels and the strand; fishing-boats,  with their sails hanging motionless, slowly made their way in by the aid  of oars. The sounds of distant music in the city came across the water.    There was no singing or dancing on board the _Flying Scud_ that evening.  All were content to sit quiet and enjoy the scene, and such conversation  as there was was carried on in low tones, as if they were under a spell  which they feared to break. The next morning all went ashore soon after  breakfast; but upon their assembling at dinner it was found that the  general impression was one of disappointment. It was a fine city, but  not so fine as it looked from the water. Except the main thoroughfares  the streets were narrow, and, as the ladies declared, dirty. The young  people, however, were not so critical; they had been delighted with the  stir and movement, the bright costumes, the variety of race and colour,  and the novelty of everything they saw.    \"The negroes amuse me most,\" Marion said. \"They seem to be always  laughing. I never saw such merry people.\"    \"They are like children,\" her father said. \"The slightest thing causes  them amusement. It is one of the signs of a low type of intellect when  people are given to laugh at trifles.\"    \"Then the natives ought to be very intelligent,\" Marion said, \"for as a  whole they appeared to me to be a serious race. Of course I saw many of  them laughing and chattering, but most of them are very quiet in manner.  The old people seem to be wrinkled in a wonderful way. I never saw  English people so wrinkled.\"    \"All southern races show age in that way,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"You see  marvellous old men and women in Spain and Italy. People who, as far as  looks go, might be a hundred and fifty--little dried-up specimens of  humanity, with faces more like those of monkeys than men.\"    \"Are the negroes slaves, Mr. Atherton? They still have slavery in  Brazil, do they not? They certainly are not at all according to my idea  of slaves.\"    \"The estates are mostly worked by negro slaves,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"and  no doubt many of those you saw to-day are also slaves. Household slavery  is seldom severe, and I believe the Brazilians are generally kind  masters. But probably the greater portion of the negroes you saw are  free. They may have purchased their freedom with their savings, or may  have been freed by kind masters. It is no very unusual thing for a  Brazilian at his death to leave a will giving freedom to all his slaves.  Government is doing its best to bring about the entire extinction of  slavery. I believe that all children born after a certain date have been  declared free, and have no doubt that in time slavery will be abolished.  Great changes like this take some time to carry out, and even for the  sake of the slaves themselves it is better to proceed quietly and  gradually. I suppose nobody inclines to go on shore again to-night?\"    There was a general negative. The day had been very warm, and having  been walking about for hours no one felt any inclination to make a fresh  start. The following morning the vessel began to unload her cargo. Some  of the older passengers declared that they had had enough of shore, and  should not land--at any rate until the afternoon. The rest went ashore;  but the greater part of them returned at lunch-time, and the heat in the  afternoon was so great that none cared to land again.    In the evening the two Allens and Wilfrid agreed to go ashore to visit a  theatre. Mr. Atherton said that as he had no inclination to melt away  all at once he would not join them, but would land with them and stroll  about for a time, and see the town in its evening aspect. Several other  parties were made up among the male passengers, and one or two of the  ladies accompanied their husbands.    Wilfrid and the Allens did not stay out the performance. The heat was  very great, and as they did not understand a word of the dialogue they  soon agreed that it would be more pleasant to stroll about, or to sit  down in the open air before a cafe and sip iced drinks.    Accordingly after walking about for a while they sat down before a cafe  in the Grand Square, and as they sipped iced lemonade looked on with  much amusement at the throng walking up and down.    \"It is later than I thought,\" James Allen said, looking at his watch.  \"It is nearly twelve o'clock, and high time for us to be on board.\"    They started to make what they thought would prove a short cut down to  the landing-place; but as usual the short cut proved delusive, and they  soon found themselves wandering in unknown streets. They asked several  persons they met the way down to the water, but none of them understood  English, and it was a considerable time before they emerged from the  streets on to the line of quays.    \"We are ever so much too far to the right,\" James Allen said as they  looked round. \"I fancy that is the ship's light not far from the shore  half a mile away on the left. I hope we shall find some boatmen to take  us off; it would be rather awkward finding ourselves here for the night  in a place where no one understands the language.\"    \"I think we should manage all right,\" Wilfrid said. \"We know the way  from the place where we landed up into the part where the hotels are,  and are sure to find people there who understand English. Still I hope  it will not come to that. They would be in a great fidget on board if we  were not to turn up to-night.\"    \"I do not think they would be alarmed,\""]]]
