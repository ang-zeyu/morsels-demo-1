SECOND JOURNEY FROM COLOGNE TO ANTWERP    I started off early by boat from Cologne on Wednesday after  St. Martin's, and went as far as . . . Paid 6 white pf. for  a pair of shoes. I gave 4 white pf. to the messenger. From  Cologne I traveled by the Rhine to Zons, from Zons to Neuss,  and from thence to Stain where we stayed the day, and I  spent 6 white pf. Thence we came to Dusseldorf, a little  town, where I spent 2 white pf.; from thence to  Kaiserswerth; from thence to Duisburg, another little town,  and we passed two castles, Angerort and Rurort; thence we  went to Orsoy, a little town; from thence we  went to  Rheinberg, another little town, where I lay overnight, and  spent 6 white pf.; from there I traveled to the following  towns, Burg Wesel, Rees, and from there to Emmerich. We came  next to Thomas, and from there to Nymwegen; there we stayed  over the night and spent 4 white pf.; from Nymwegen I  traveled to Tiel, and from there to Herzogenbusch. At  Emmerich I stopped and spent 3 white pf. on a very good  meal. There I took the portrait of a goldsmith's apprentice,  Peter Federmacher of Antwerp, and of a woman. The reason of  our staying was that a great storm of wind overtook us. I  spent besides 5 white pf., and I changed 1 florin for  expenses; also I took the host's portrait, and we did not  get to Nymwegen until Sunday; I gave the boatmen 20 white  pf. Nymwegen is a beautiful city, and has a fine church and  a well-situated castle; from there we traveled to Tiel,  where we left the Rhine and continued on the Maas to  Heerewarden, where the two towers stand; there we lay over  night, and during this day I spent 7 stivers. From there we  started early on Tuesday for Bommel on the Maas; there a  great storm of wind overtook us and we hired some peasant  horses and rode without saddles as far as Herzogenbusch, and  I paid 1 florin for the journey by boat and horse.  Herzogenbusch is a beautiful city, and has an extremely  beautiful church and a strong fortress; there I spent 10  stivers, although Arnold settled for the repast. The  goldsmiths came to me and showed me great honour. From there  we traveled on Our Lady's Day early and came through the  large and beautiful village of Oosterwyck. We breakfasted at  Tilborch and spent 4 white pf.; from there we came to  Baarle, lay the night there, and spent 3 stivers, and my  companions got into an argument with the innkeeper, so we  went on in the night to Hoogstraten; there we stopped two  hours and went by St. Leonhard Kirchen to Harscht. We  breakfasted there and spent 4 stivers.      SECOND STAY AT ANTWERP (November 22-December 3, 1520)    From there we journeyed to Antwerp and gave the driver 15  stivers. This was on Thursday after Our Lady's Assumption  [by error for Presentation]; and I gave an engraving of the  \"Passion\" to John, Jobst Schwager's man, and I made a  portrait of Nicolas Sopalis, and on the Thursday after Our  Lady's Assumption [Presentation], 1520, I was once more back  in Jobst Planckfelt's house; I have eaten with him IIII  times. My wife-II-changed 1 florin for expenses, besides a  crown; and the seven weeks that I have been away my wife and  maid have spent 7 crowns and bought another 4 florins' worth  of things. I spent 4 stivers in company. I have dined with  Tomasin IIIIII times. On St. Martin's Day my wife had her  purse cut off in Our Lady's Church at Antwerp; there were 2  florins in it, and the purse itself, besides what was in it,  was worth another florin, and some keys were in it, too. On  the eve before St. Catherine's I paid Jobst Planckfelt, my  host, 10 gold crowns for my reckoning. I dined two times  with the Portuguese. Rodrigo gave me six Indian nuts, so I  gave his boy 2 stivers for a tip. I paid 19 stivers for  parchment; changed 2 crowns for expenses.    I sold two \"Adam and Eves,\" one \"Sea Monster,\" one \"Jerome,\"  one \"Knight,\" one \"Nemesis,\" one \"St. Eustace,\" one whole  sheet, besides seventeen etched pieces, eight quarter-  sheets, and ten wood-cuts, seven of the bad woodcuts, two  books, and ten small wood \"Passions,\" the whole for 8  florins. Also I exchanged three large books for one ounce  [ell of?] camlet. I changed a Philip's florin for expenses  and my wife likewise changed a florin.    At Zierikzee in Zeeland a whale has been washed ashore by a  great tide and storm; it is much more than a hundred fathoms  long; no one in Zeeland has ever seen one even one-third as  long, and the fish cannot get off the land. The people would  be glad to see it gone, for they fear the great stink, for  it is so big they say it could not be cut in pieces and the  oil got out of it in half a year.    Stephen Capello has given me a cedarwood rosary, in return  for which I was to take and have taken his portrait. I paid  4 stivers for furnace brown and a pair of snuffers; I gave 3  stivers for paper; made a portrait of Felix, kneeling, in  his book in pen and ink, and Felix gave me one hundred  oysters. I gave Herr Lazarus, the great man, an engraved  \"Jerome\" and three large books. Rodrigo sent me some wine  and oysters. I paid 7 white pf. for black chalk. I have had  to dinner Tomasin, Gerhard, Tomasin's daughter, her husband,  the glass painter Hennick, Jobst and his wife, and Felix,  which cost 2 florins. Tomasin made me a gift of four ells of  gray damask for a doublet. I have changed a Philip's florin  for expenses.      VISIT TO ZEELAND (December 3-14, 1520)    On St. Barbara's Eve I traveled from Antwerp to Bergen-op-  Zoom; I paid 2 stivers for the horse, and I spent 1 florin 6  stivers here. At Bergen I bought my wife a thin  Netherlandish head cloth, which cost 1 florin, 7 stivers,  besides 6 stivers for three pairs of shoes, 1 stiver for  eyeglasses, and 6 stivers for an ivory button; gave 2  stivers for a tip. I have drawn the portraits in charcoal of  Jan de Has, his wife, and two daughters; and the maid and  the old woman in silverpoint, in my sketch-book. I saw the  Van Bergen house, which is a very large and beautiful  building. Bergen is a pleasant place in summer, and two  great fairs are held there yearly.    On Our Lady's Eve I started with my companions for Zeeland,  and Sebastian Imhof lent me five florins; and the first  night we lay at anchor in the sea; it was very cold and we  had neither food nor drink. On Saturday we came to Goes, and  there I drew a girl in the costume of the place. Thence we  traveled to Arnemuiden, and I paid 15 stivers for expenses.  We went by a sunken place, where we saw the tops of the  roofs standing up above the water, and we went by the island  of Wolfersdyk, and passed the little town Kortgene on  another island lying near. Zeeland has seven islands, and  Arnemuiden, where I lay the night, is the biggest. From  there I traveled to Middelburg. There in the abbey Jan de  Mabuse has made a great picture, not so good in the drawing  as in the colouring. From there I went to the Veere, where  ships from all lands lie. It is a very fine little town.    But at Arnemuiden, where I landed, there happened to me a  great misfortune. As we were coming to land and getting out  our rope, just as we were getting on shore, a great ship ran  into us so hard that in the crush I let everyone get out  before me, so that no one but myself, George Kotzler, two  old women, the sailor, and a little boy were left in the  ship. When now the other ship knocked against us and I with  those mentioned was on the ship and could not get out, the  strong rope broke, and at the same moment a violent storm of  wind arose which forcibly drove back our ship. So we all  called for help, but no one would risk himself, and the wind  carried us back out to sea. Then the skipper tore his hair  and cried aloud, for all his men had landed and the ship was  unmanned. It was a matter of fear and danger, for there was  a great wind and no more than six persons in the ship, so I  spoke to the skipper that he should take heart and have hope  in God, and should take thought for what was to be done. He  said that if he could pull up the small sail, he would try  if we could come again to land. So we all helped one another  and pulled it half-way up with difficulty, and went on again  towards the land. And when those on the land who had already  given us up saw how we helped ourselves, they too came to  our aid, and we got to land.    Middelburg is a good town; it has a very beautiful town hall  with a fine tower. There is much art shown in all things  here. There are very rich and beautiful stalls in the abbey,  and a splendid gallery of stone and a beautiful parish  church.  The town is excellent for sketching. Zeeland is  beautiful and wonderful to see on account of the water, for  it stands higher than the land.    I have made a portrait of my host at Arnemuiden. Master  Hugo, Alexander Imhof, and the Hirschvogel's servant  Frederick gave me each of them an Indian nut that they had  won at play, and the host gave me a sprouting bulb.    Early on Monday morning we went back to the ship and set out  for the Veere and for Zierikzee; I wanted to get sight of  the great fish, but the tide had carried it off again. I  paid 2 florins for fare and expenses and 2 florins for a  rug, 4 stivers for a fig-cheese and 3 stivers for carriage,  and I lost 6 stivers at play. When we came back to Bergen I  gave 10 stivers for an ivory comb.    I have taken Schnabhan's portrait, and I have also taken the  portrait of my host's son-in-law, Klautz. Gave 2 florins  less 5 stivers for a piece of tin; also 2 florins for a bad  piece of tin. I have also taken the portrait of little  Bernard of Brussels, George Kotzler, and the Frenchman from  Kamrick; each of them gave me 1 florin at Bergen. Jan de  Has' son-in-law gave me 1 Horn florin for his portrait, and  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32298"],[0,"Anciennes loix des François conservées dans les coutumes angloises recueillies (#9)"],[1,"sinistro, locum habebit  depositum, quod quidem si devastetur, locus erit pecuniæ, & qui alienum  accommodat in casu quo accommodare oportebit, proprium devastat.
