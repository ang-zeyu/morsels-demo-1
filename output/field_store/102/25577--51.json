Seeing his fate, the cunning vagabond said,  \"Now I do see it was by your orders the chief was appointed, and not  by a whim of Sheikh Said's; I will obey him for the future;\" and these  words were hardly pronounced than the three missing goats rushed like  magic into camp, nobody of course knowing where they came from.    Skirting along the margin of the rising ground overlooking the river,  through thick woods, cleared in places for cultivation, we arrived at  Thumba Lhere. The chief here took a hongo of three yards merikani and  two yards kiniki without much fuss, for he had no power. The pagazis  struck, and said they would not move from this unless I gave them one  fundo or ten necklaces of beads each daily, in lieu of rations, as they  were promised by Ladha on the coast that I would do so as soon as they  had made four marches. This was an obvious invention, concocted to try  my generosity, for I had given the kirangozi a goat, which is customary,  to \"make the journey prosperous\"--had suspended a dollar to his neck in  recognition of his office, and given him four yards merikani, that he  might have a grand feast with his brothers; while neither the Sheikh,  myself, nor any one else in the camp, had heard of such a compact. With  high words the matter dropped, African fashion.    The pagazis would not start at the appointed time, hoping to enforce  their demands of last night; so we took the lead and started, followed  by the Wanguana. Seeing this, the pagazis cried out with one accord:  \"The master is gone, leaving the responsibility of his property in our  hands; let us follow, let us follow, for verily he is our father;\" and  all came hurrying after us. Here the river, again making a bend, is lost  to sight, and we marched through large woods and cultivated fields to  Muhugue, observing, as we passed long, the ochreish colour of the earth,  and numerous pits which the copal-diggers had made searching for their  much-valued gum. A large coast-bound caravan, carrying ivory tusks with  double-toned bells suspended to them, ting-tonging as they moved along,  was met on the way; and as some of the pagazis composing it were men who  had formerly taken me to the Victoria N'yanza, warm recognitions passed  between us. The water found here turned our brandy and tea as black as  ink. The chief, being a man of small pretensions, took only one sahari  and four yards merikani.    Instead of going on to the next village we halted in this jungly  place for the day, that I might comply with the desire of the Royal  Geographical Society to inspect Muhonyera, and report if there were  really any indications of a \"raised sea-beach\" there, such as their maps  indicate. An inspection brought me to the conclusion that no mind but  one prone to discovering sea-beaches in the most unlikely places  could have supposed for a moment that one existed here. The form and  appearance of the land are the same as we have seen everywhere since  leaving Bomani--a low plateau subtended by a bank cut down by the  Kingani river, and nothing more. There are no pebbles; the soil is rich  reddish loam, well covered with trees, bush, and grass, in which some  pigs and antelopes are found. From the top of this enbankment we gain  the first sight of the East Coast Range, due west of us, represented  by the high elephant's-back hill, Mkambaku, in Usagara, which, joining  Uraguru, stretches northwards across the Pangani river to Usumbara and  the Kilimandjaro, and southwards, with a westerly deflection, across the  Lufiji to Southern N'yassa. What course the range takes beyond those two  extremes, the rest of the world knows as well as I. Another conspicuous  landmark here is Kidunda (the little hill), which is the southernmost  point of a low chain of hills, also tending northwards, and representing  an advance-guard to the higher East Coast Range in its rear. At night,  as we had no local \"sultans\" to torment us, eight more men of sultan  Majid's donation ran away, and, adding injury to injury, took with them  all our goats, fifteen in number. This was a sad loss. We could keep  ourselves on guinea-fowls or green pigeons, doves, etc.; but the  Hottentots wanted nourishment much more than ourselves, and as their  dinner always consisted of what we left, \"short-commons\" was the fate in  store for them. The Wanguana, instead of regarding these poor creatures  as soldiers, treated them like children; and once, as a diminutive  Tot--the common name they go by--was exerting himself to lift his pack  and place it on his mule, a fine Herculean Mguana stepped up behind,  grasped Tot, pack and all, in his muscular arms, lifted the whole over  his head, paraded the Tot about, struggling for release, and put him  down amidst the laughter of the camp, then saddled his mule and patted  him on the back.    After sending a party of Beluch to track down the deserters and goats,  in which they were not successful, we passed through the village of  Sagesera, and camped one mile beyond, close to the river. Phanze Kirongo  (which means Mr Pit) here paid us his respects, with a presentation of  rice. In return he received four yards merikani and one dubuani, which  Bombay settled, as the little Sheikh, ever done by the sultans, pleaded  indisposition, to avoid the double fire he was always subjected to  on these occasions, by the sultans grasping on the one side, and my  resisting on the other; for I relied on my strength, and thought it  very inadvisable to be generous with my cloth to the prejudice of future  travellers, by decreasing the value of merchandise, and increasing  proportionately the expectations of these negro chiefs. From the top  of the bank bordering on the valley, a good view was obtainable of the  Uraguru hills, and the top of a very distant cone to its northward;  but I could see no signs of any river joining the kingani on its left,  though on the former expedition I heard that the Mukondokua river,  which was met with in Usagara, joined the Kingani close to Sagesera, and  actually formed its largest head branch. Neither could Mr Pit inform  me what became of the Mukondokua, as the Wazaramo are not given to  travelling. He had heard of it from the traders, but only knew himself  of one river beside the Kingani. It was called Wami in Uegura, and  mouths at Utondue, between the ports of Whindi and Saadani. To try and  check the desertions of Sultan Majid's men, I advised--ordering was  of no use--that their camp should be broken up, and they should be  amalgamated with the Wanguana; but it was found that the two would not  mix. In fact, the whole native camp consisted of so many clubs of two,  four, six, or ten men, who originally belonged to one village or one  master, or were united by some other family tie which they preferred  keeping intact; so they cooked together, ate together, slept together,  and sometimes mutinied together. The amalgamation having failed, I wrote  some emanicipation tickets, called the Sultan's men all up together,  selected the best, gave them these tickets, announced that their pay  and all rewards would be placed for the future on the same conditions as  those of the Wanguana, and as soon as I saw any signs of improvement in  the rest, they would all be treated in the same manner; but should they  desert, they would find my arm long enough to arrest them on the coast  and put them into prison.    During this march we crossed three deep nullahs which drain the Uzaramo  plateau, and arrived at the Makutaniro, or junction of this line with  those of Mboamaji and Konduchi, which traverse central Uzaramo, and  which, on my former return journey, I went down. The gum-copal diggings  here cease. The Dum palm is left behind; the large rich green-leaved  trees of the low plateau give place to the mimosa; and now, having  ascended the greater decline of the Kingani river, instead of being  confined by a bank, we found ourselves on flat open-park land, where  antelopes roam at large, buffalo and zebra are sometimes met with, and  guinea-fowl are numerous. The water for the camp is found in the river,  but supplies of grain come from the village of Kipora farther on.    A march through the park took us to a camp by a pond, from which, by  crossing the Kingani, rice and provisions for the men were obtained on  the opposite bank. One can seldom afford to follow wild animals on the  line of march, otherwise we might have bagged some antelopes to-day,  which, scared by the interminable singing, shouting, bell-jingling,  horn-blowing, and other such merry noises of the moving caravan, could  be seen disappearing in the distance.    Leaving the park, we now entered the riches part of Uzaramo, affording  crops as fine as any part of India. Here it was, in the district of  Dege la Mhora, that the first expedition to this country, guided by a  Frenchman, M. Maizan, came to a fatal termination, that gentleman having  been barbarously murdered by the sub-chief Hembe. The cause of the  affair was distinctly explained to me by Hembe himself, who, with  his cousin Darunga, came to call upon me, presuming, as he was not  maltreated by the last expedition, that the matter would now be  forgotten. The two men were very great friends of the little Sheikh,  and as a present was expected, which I should have to pay, we all talked  cheerfully and confidentially, bringing in the fate of Maizan for no  other reason than to satisfy curiosity. Hembe, who lives in the centre  of an almost impenetrable thicket, confessed that he was the murderer,  but said the fault did not rest with him, as he merely carried out the  instructions of his father, Mzungera, who, a Diwan on the coast, sent  him a letter directing his actions. Thus it is proved that the plot  against Maizan was concocted on the coast by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#9)"],[1," chest.    \"You have been badly hurt, Ranald tells me. How did it happen?\"    \"Well,\" said Macdonald, slowly, \"it is very hard to say.\"    \"Did the tree fall on you?\" asked Mrs. Murray.    Macdonald glanced at her quickly, and then answered: \"It is very  dangerous work with the trees. It is wonderful how quick they will  fall.\"    \"Your face and breast seem very badly bruised and cut.\"    \"Aye, yes,\" said Macdonald. \"The breast is bad whatever.\"    \"I think you had better send for Doctor Grant,\" Mrs. Murray said. \"There  may be some internal injury.\"    \"No, no,\" said Macdonald, decidedly. \"I will have no doctor at me, and  I will soon be round again, if the Lord will. When will the minister be  home?\"    But Mrs. Murray, ignoring his attempt to escape the subject, went on:  \"Yes, but, Mr. Macdonald, I am anxious to have Doctor Grant see you, and  I wish you would send for him to-morrow.\"    \"Ah, well,\" said Macdonald, not committing himself, \"we will be seeing  about that. But the doctor has not been in this house for many a day.\"  Then, after a pause, he added, in a low voice, \"Not since the day she  was taken from me.\"    \"Was she ill long?\"    \"Indeed, no. It was just one night. There was no doctor, and the women  could not help her, and she was very bad--and when it came it was a  girl--and it was dead--and then the doctor arrived, but he was too  late.\" Macdonald Dubh finished with a great sigh, and the minister's  wife said gently to him:    \"That was a very sad day, and a great loss to you and Ranald.\"    \"Aye, you may say it; she was a bonnie woman whatever, and grand at the  spinning and the butter. And, oich-hone, it was a sad day for us.\"    The minister's wife sat silent, knowing that such grief cannot be  comforted, and pitying from her heart the lonely man. After a time she  said gently, \"She is better off.\"    A look of doubt and pain and fear came into Macdonald's eyes.    \"She never came forward,\" he said, hesitatingly. \"She was afraid to  come.\"    \"I have heard of her often, Mr. Macdonald, and I have heard that she was  a good and gentle woman.\"    \"Aye, she was that.\"    \"And kind to the sick.\"    \"You may believe it.\"    \"And she loved the house of God.\"    \"Aye, and neither rain nor snow nor mud would be keeping her from it,  but she would be going every Sabbath day, bringing her stockings with  her.\"    \"Her stockings?\"    \"Aye, to change her feet in the church. What else? Her stockings would  be wet with the snow and water.\"    Mrs. Murray nodded. \"And she loved her Saviour, Mr. Macdonald.\"    \"Indeed, I believe it well, but she was afraid she would not be having  'the marks.'\"    \"Never you fear, Mr. Macdonald,\" said Mrs. Murray. \"If she loved her  Saviour she is with him now.\"    He turned around to her and lifted himself eagerly on his elbow. \"And do  you really think that?\" he said, in a voice subdued and anxious.    \"Indeed I do,\" said Mrs. Murray, in a tone of certain conviction.    Macdonald sank back on his pillow, and after a moment's silence, said,  in a voice of pain: \"Oh, but it is a peety she did not know! It is a  peety she did not know. For many's the time before--before--her hour  came on her, she would be afraid.\"    \"But she was not afraid at the last, Mr. Macdonald?\"    \"Indeed, no. I wondered at her. She was like a babe in its mother's  arms. There was a light on her face, and I mind well what she said.\"  Macdonald paused. There was a stir in the kitchen, and Mrs. Murray,  glancing behind her, saw Ranald standing near the door intently  listening. Then Macdonald went on. \"I mind well the words, as if it was  yesterday. 'Hugh, my man,' she said, 'am no feared' (she was from the  Lowlands, but she was a fine woman); 'I haena the marks, but 'm no  feared but He'll ken me. Ye'll tak' care o' Ranald, for, oh, Hugh! I ha'  gi'en him to the Lord. The Lord help you to mak' a guid man o' him.'\"  Macdonald's voice faltered into silence, then, after a few moments, he  cried, \"And oh! Mistress Murra', I cannot tell you the often these words  do keep coming to me; and it is myself that has not kept the promise I  made to her, and may the Lord forgive me.\"    The look of misery in the dark eyes touched Mrs. Murray to the heart.  She laid her hand on Macdonald's arm, but she could not find words to  speak. Suddenly Macdonald recalled himself.    \"You will forgive me,\" he said; \"and you will not be telling any one.\"    By this time the tears were streaming down her face, and Mrs. Murray  could only say, brokenly, \"You know I will not.\"    \"Aye, I do,\" said Macdonald, with a sigh of content, and he turned his  face away from her to the wall.    \"And now you let me read to you,\" she said, softly, and taking from her  bag the Gaelic Bible, which with much toil she had learned to read since  coming to this Highland congregation, she read to him from the old Psalm  those words, brave, tender, and beautiful, that have so often comforted  the weary and wandering children of men, \"The Lord is my Shepherd,\" and  so on to the end. Then from psalm to psalm she passed, selecting such  parts as suited her purpose, until Macdonald turned to her again and  said, admiringly:    \"It is yourself that has the bonnie Gaelic.\"    \"I am afraid,\" she said, with a smile, \"it is not really good, but it is  the best a south country woman can do.\"    \"Indeed, it is very pretty,\" he said, earnestly.    Then the minister's wife said, timidly, \"I cannot pray in the Gaelic.\"    \"Oh, the English will be very good,\" said Macdonald, and she knelt down  and in simple words poured out her heart in prayer. Before she rose from  her knees she opened the Gaelic Bible, and turned to the words of the  Lord's Prayer.    \"We will say this prayer together,\" she said, gently.    Macdonald, bowing his head gravely, answered: \"It is what she would  often be doing with me.\"    There was still only one woman to this lonely hearted man, and with  a sudden rush of pity that showed itself in her breaking voice, the  minister's wife began in Gaelic, \"Our Father which art in heaven.\"    Macdonald followed her in a whisper through the petitions until they  came to the words, \"And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,\"  when he paused and would say no more. Mrs. Murray repeated the words of  the petition, but still there was no response. Then the minister's wife  knew that she had her finger upon a sore spot, and she finished the  prayer alone.    For a time she sat silent, unwilling to probe the wound, and yet too  brave to flinch from what she felt to be duty.    \"We have much to be forgiven,\" she said, gently. \"More than we can ever  forgive.\" Still there was silence.    \"And the heart that cannot forgive an injury is closed to the  forgiveness of God.\"    The morning sun was gleaming through the treetops, and Mrs. Murray was  worn with her night's vigil, and anxious to get home. She rose, and  offering Macdonald her hand, smiled down into his face, and said: \"Good  by! We must try to forgive.\"    As he took her hand, Macdonald's dark face began to work, and he broke  forth into a bitter cry.    \"He took me unawares! And it was a coward's blow! and I will not forgive  him until I have given him what he deserves, if the Lord spares me!\" And  then he poured forth, in hot and bitter words, the story of the great  fight. By the time he had finished his tale Ranald had come in from the  kitchen, and was standing with clenched fists and face pale with passion  at the foot of the bed.    As Mrs. Murray listened to this story her eyes began to burn, and when  it was over, she burst forth: \"Oh, it was a cruel and cowardly and  brutal thing for men to do! And did you beat them off?\" she asked.    \"Aye, and that we did,\" burst in Ranald. And in breathless haste and  with flashing eye he told them of Macdonald Bhain's part in the fight.    \"Splendid!\" cried the minister's wife, forgetting herself for the  moment.    \"But he let him go,\" said Ranald, sadly. \"He would not strike him, but  just let him go.\"    Then the minister's wife cried again: \"Ah, he is a great man, your  uncle! And a great Christian. Greater than I could have been, for I  would have slain him then and there.\" Her eyes flashed, and the color  flamed in her face as she uttered these words.    \"Aye,\" said Macdonald Dubh, regarding her with deep satisfaction. His  tone and look recalled the minister's wife, and turning to Ranald, she  added, sadly:    \"But your uncle was right, Ranald, and we must forgive even as he did.\"    \"That,\" cried Ranald, with fierce emphasis, \"I will never do, until once  I will be having my hands on his throat.\"    \"Hush, Ranald!\" said the minister's wife. \"I know it is hard, but we  must forgive. You see we MUST forgive. And we must ask Him to help us,  who has more to forgive than any other.\"    But she said no more to Macdonald Dubh on that subject that morning. The  fire of the battle was in her heart, and she felt she could more easily  sympathize with his desire for vengeance than with the Christian grace  of forgiveness. But as they rode home together through the bush, where  death had trailed them so closely the night before, the sweet sunlight  and the crisp, fresh air, and all the still beauty of the morning,  working with the memory of their saving, rebuked and soothed and  comforted her, and when Ranald turned back from the manse door, she said  softly: \"Our Father in heaven was very good to us, Ranald, and we should  be like him. He forgives and loves, and we should, too.\"    And Ranald, looking into the sweet face, pale with the long night's  trials, but tinged now with the faintest touch of color from the  morning, felt somehow that it might be possible to forgive.    But many days had to come and go, and many waters flow over the souls  of Macdonald Dubh and his son Ranald, before they were able to say,  \"Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.\"        CHAPTER VI    A NEW FRIEND      The night race with the wolves"]]]
