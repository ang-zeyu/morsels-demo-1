Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#9)"],[1," rescue, as it was concluded that he had been surrounded by Indians in  the Natchez Pass.  We started early the next morning, the snow  falling slightly as we set out, and soon arrived at the eastern mouth  of the Natchez Pass.  On the way we noticed an abandoned Indian  village, which had evidently not been occupied for some time.  As we  proceeded the storm increased, and the snow-fall became deeper and  deeper, until finally our horses could not travel through it.  In  consequence we were compelled to give up further efforts to advance,  and obliged to turn back to the abandoned village, where we encamped  for the night.  Near night-fall the storm greatly increased, and our  bivouac became most uncomfortable; but spreading my blankets on the  snow and covering them with Indian matting, I turned in and slept  with that soundness and refreshment accorded by nature to one  exhausted by fatigue.  When I awoke in the morning I found myself  under about two feet of snow, from which I arose with difficulty, yet  grateful that it had kept me warm during the night.    After a cup of coffee and a little hard bread, it was decided we  should return to the main camp near the Mission, for we were now  confident that Maloney was delayed by the snow, and safe enough on  the other side of the mountains.  At all events he was beyond aid  from us, for the impassable snowdrifts could not be overcome with the  means in our possession.  It turned out that our suppositions as to  the cause of his delay were correct.  He had met with the same  difficulties that confronted us, and had been compelled to go into  camp.    Meanwhile valuable time had been lost, and the Indians, with their  families and stock, were well on their way to the Okenagan country, a  region into which we could not penetrate in the winter season.  No  other course was therefore left but to complete the dismal failure of  the expedition by returning home, and our commander readily gave the  order to march back to the Dalles by the \"short\" route over the  Yakima Mountains.    As the storm was still unabated, it was evident our march home would  be a most difficult one, and it was deemed advisable to start back at  once, lest we should be blocked up in the mountains by the snows for  a period beyond which our provisions would not last.  Relying on the  fact that the short route to the Dalles would lead us over the range  at its most depressed point, where it was hoped the depth of snow was  not yet so great as to make the route impassable, we started with  Colonel Nesmith's battalion in advance to break the road, followed by  my dragoons.  In the valley we made rapid progress, but when we  reached the mountain every step we took up its side showed the snow  to be growing deeper and deeper.  At last Nesmith reached the summit,  and there found a depth of about six feet of snow covering the  plateau in every direction, concealing all signs of the trail so  thoroughly that his guides became bewildered and took the wrong  divide.  The moment I arrived at the top my guide--Donald Mc Kay--who  knew perfectly the whole Yakima range, discovered Nesmith's mistake.  Word was sent to bring him back, but as he had already nearly crossed  the plateau, considerable delay occurred before he returned.  When he  arrived we began anew the work of breaking a road for the foot troops  behind us, my detachment now in advance.  The deep snow made our work  extremely laborious, exhausting men and horses almost to the point of  relinquishing the struggle, but our desperate situation required that  we should get down into the valley beyond, or run the chance of  perishing on the mountain in a storm which seemed unending.  About  midnight the column reached the valley, very tired and hungry, but  much elated over its escape.  We had spent a day of the most intense  anxiety, especially those who had had the responsibility of keeping  to the right trail, and been charged with the hard work of breaking  the road for the infantry and artillery through such a depth of snow.    Our main difficulties were now over, and in due time we reached the  Dalles, where almost everyone connected with the expedition voted it  a wretched failure; indeed, General Rains himself could not think  otherwise, but he scattered far and wide blame for the failure of his  combinations.  This, of course, led to criminations and  recriminations, which eventuated in charges of incompetency preferred  against him by Captain Edward O. C. Ord, of the Third Artillery.  Rains met the charges with counter-charges against Ord, whom he  accused of purloining Father Pandoza's shoes, when the soldiers in  their fury about the ammunition destroyed the Mission.  At the time  of its destruction a rumor of this nature was circulated through  camp, started by some wag, no doubt in jest; for Ord, who was  somewhat eccentric in his habits, and had started on the expedition  rather indifferently shod in carpet-slippers, here came out in a  brand-new pair of shoes.  Of course there was no real foundation for  such a report, but Rains was not above small things, as the bringing  of this petty accusation attests.  Neither party was ever tried, for  General John E. Wool the department commander, had not at command a  sufficient number of officers of appropriate rank to constitute a  court in the case of Rains, and the charges against Ord were very  properly ignored on account of their trifling character.    Shortly after the expedition returned to the Dalles, my detachment  was sent down to Fort Vancouver, and I remained at that post during  the winter of 1855-'56, till late in March.          CHAPTER V.    AN INDIAN CONFEDERATION--MASSACRE AT THE CASCADES OF THE  COLUMBIA--PLAN TO RELIEVE THE BLOCKHOUSE--A HAZARDOUS FLANK  MOVEMENT--A NEW METHOD OF ESTABLISHING GUILT--EXECUTION OF  THE INDIAN MURDERERS.    The failure of the Haller expedition from lack of a sufficient force,  and of the Rains expedition from the incompetency of its commander,  was a great mortification to the officers and men connected with  them, and, taken together, had a marked effect upon the Indian  situation in Oregon and Washington Territories at that particular  era.  Besides, it led to further complications and troubles, for it  had begun to dawn upon the Indians that the whites wanted to come in  and dispossess them of their lands and homes, and the failures of  Haller and Rains fostered the belief with the Indians that they could  successfully resist the pressure of civilization.    Acting under these influences, the Spokanes, Walla Wallas, Umatillas,  and Nez Perces cast their lot with the hostiles, and all the savage  inhabitants of the region east of the Cascade Range became involved  in a dispute as to whether the Indians or the Government should  possess certain sections of the country, which finally culminated in  the war of 1856.    Partly to meet the situation that was approaching, the Ninth Infantry  had been sent out from the Atlantic coast to Washington Territory,  and upon its arrival at Fort Vancouver encamped in front of the  officers' quarters, on the beautiful parade-ground of that post, and  set about preparing for the coming campaign.  The commander, Colonel  George Wright, who had been promoted to the colonelcy of the regiment  upon its organization the previous year, had seen much active duty  since his graduation over thirty years before, serving with credit in  the Florida and Mexican wars.  For the three years previous to his  assignment to the Ninth Infantry he had been stationed on the Pacific  coast, and the experience he had there acquired, added to his  excellent soldierly qualities, was of much benefit in the active  campaigns in which, during the following years, he was to  participate.  Subsequently his career was brought to an untimely  close when, nine years after this period, as he was returning to the  scene of his successes, he, in common with many others was drowned by  the wreck of the ill-fated steamer Brother Jonathan.  Colonel Wright  took command of the district in place of Rains, and had been at  Vancouver but a short time before he realized that it would be  necessary to fight the confederated tribes east of the Cascade Range  of mountains, in order to disabuse them of the idea that they were  sufficiently strong to cope with the power of the Government.  He  therefore at once set about the work of organizing and equipping his  troops for a start in the early spring against the hostile Indians,  intending to make the objective point of his expedition the heart of  the Spokane country on the Upper Columbia River, as the head and  front of the confederation was represented in the person of old  Cammiackan, chief of the Spokanes.    The regiment moved from Fort Vancouver by boat, March 25, 1856, and  landed at the small town called the Dalles, below the mouth of the  Des Chutes River at the eastern base of the Cascade Range, and just  above where the Columbia River enters those mountains.  This  rendezvous was to be the immediate point of departure, and all the  troops composing the expedition were concentrated there.    On the morning of March 26 the movement began, but the column had  only reached Five Mile Creek when the Yakimas, joined by many young  warriors-free lances from other tribes, made a sudden and unexpected  attack at the Cascades of the Columbia, midway between Vancouver and  the Dalles, killed several citizens, women and children, and took  possession of the Portage by besieging the settlers in their cabins  at the Upper Cascades, and those who sought shelter at the Middle  Cascades in the old military block-house, which had been built some  years before as a place of refuge under just such circumstances.  These points held out, and were not captured, but the landing at the  Lower Cascades fell completely into the hands of the savages.  Straggling settlers from the Lower Cascades made their way down to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#9)"],[1,"   39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because  it makes people happy or virtuous--excepting, perhaps, the amiable  \"Idealists,\" who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful,  and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities  swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no  arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of  thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as  little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in  the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental  constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full  knowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured by  the amount of \"truth\" it could endure--or to speak more plainly, by the  extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped,  and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain  PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably  situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the  wicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps  severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of  strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined,  yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are  prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always,  to begin with, that the term \"philosopher\" be not confined to the  philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into  books!--Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the  free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will  not omit to underline--for it is OPPOSED to German taste. \"Pour etre  bon philosophe,\" says this last great psychologist, \"il faut etre sec,  clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du  caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire  pour voir clair dans ce qui est.\"    40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things  have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only  be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question  worth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not already  ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a  delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness  and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an  extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take  a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his  recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in  order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:  shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is  most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so much  goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and  fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like  an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame  requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his  destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach,  and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate  friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their  eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature,  which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is  inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a  mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his  friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be  opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--and  that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more,  around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to  the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation  of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he  manifests.    41. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined  for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not  avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous  game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves  and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the  dearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to  a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is even  less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not  to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar  torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave  to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries,  apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to one's own  liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which  always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--the  danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as  a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our \"hospitality\" for  instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed  and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with  themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes  a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF--the best test of  independence.    42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize  them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far  as they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature to  WISH to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of the  future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as  \"tempters.\" This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be  preferred, a temptation.    43. Will they be new friends of \"truth,\" these coming philosophers? Very  probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But  assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their  pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still  be truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wish  and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. \"My opinion is MY opinion:  another person has not easily a right to it\"--such a philosopher of the  future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to  agree with many people. \"Good\" is no longer good when one's neighbour  takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a \"common good\"! The  expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of  small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always  been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the  profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up  shortly, everything rare for the rare.      44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY  free spirits, these philosophers of the future--as certainly also they  will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater,  and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and  mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much  to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and  forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old  prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the  conception of \"free spirit\" obscure. In every country of Europe, and the  same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of  this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits,  who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts  prompt--not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are  appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.  Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly  named \"free spirits\"--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of  the democratic taste and its \"modern ideas\" all of them men without  solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom  neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they  are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their  innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and  failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notion  which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain  with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the  herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life  for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines  are called \"Equality of Rights\" and \"Sympathy with All Sufferers\"--and  suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be  DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and  conscience to the question how and where the plant \"man\" has hitherto  grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under  the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his  situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and  dissembling power (his \"spirit\") had to develop into subtlety and daring  under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be  increased to the unconditioned Will to Power--we believe that severity,  violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,  stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,--that everything  wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves  as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we do  not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any"]]]
