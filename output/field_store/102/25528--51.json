Then among a  second series of corresponding bells which, arranged without the  semitones, are mixed together upon the table, he tries, by striking  the bells one after the other, to find the sound which is the same as  the first one he has struck (doh). When he has succeeded in finding  the corresponding sound, he puts the bell thus chosen opposite the  first one (doh) upon the board. Then he strikes the second bell, _re_,  once or twice; then from among the mixed group of bells he makes  experiments until he recognizes _re_, which he places opposite the  second bell of the series already arranged. He continues in the same  way right to the end, looking for the identity of the sounds and  performing an exercise of _pairing_ similar to that already done in  the case of the sound-boxes, the colors, etc.    Later, he learns in order the sounds of the musical scale, striking in  rapid succession the bells arranged in order, and also accompanying  his action with his voice--doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh. When  he is able to recognize and _remember_ the series of sounds, the child  takes the eight bells and, after mixing them up, he tries by striking  them with the hammer, to find _doh_, then _re_, etc. Every time that  he takes a new note, he strikes from the beginning all the bells  already recognized and arranged in order--doh, _re_, doh, re, _mi_;  doh, re, mi, _fah_; doh, re, mi, fah, _soh_, etc. In this way he  succeeds in arranging all the bells in the order of the scale, guided  only by his ear, and having succeeded, he strikes all the notes one  after the other up and down the scale. This exercise fascinates  children from five years old upwards.    If the objects which have been described constitute the didactic  material for the beginnings of a methodical education of the auditory  sense, I have no desire to limit to them an educational process which  is so important and already so complex in its practise, whether in the  long established methods of treatment for the deaf, or in modern  physiological musical education. In fact, I also use resonant metal  tubes, small bars of wood which emit musical notes, and strings  (little harps), upon which the children seek to recognize the tones  they have already learned with the exercise of the bells. The  pianoforte may also be used for the same purpose. In this way the  difference in _timbre_ comes to be perceived together with the  differences in tone. At the same time various exercises, already  mentioned, such as the marches played on the piano for rhythmic  exercises, and the simple songs sung by the children themselves, offer  extensive means for the development of the musical sense.                      *       *       *       *       *    To quicken the child's attention in special relation to sounds there  is a most important exercise which, contrary to all attempts made up  to this time in the practise of education, consists not in producing  but in eliminating, as far as possible, all sounds from the  environment. My \"lesson of silence\" has been very widely applied, even  in schools where the rest of my method has not found its way, for the  sake of its practical effect upon the discipline of the children.    The children are taught \"not to move\"; to inhibit all those motor  impulses which may arise from any cause whatsoever, and in order to  induce in them real \"immobility,\" it is necessary to initiate them in  the _control_ of all their movements. The teacher, then, does not  limit herself to saying, \"Sit still,\" but she gives them the example  herself, showing them how to sit absolutely still; that is, with feet  still, body still, arms still, head still. The respiratory movements  should also be performed in such a way as to produce no sound.    The children must be taught how to succeed in this exercise. The  fundamental condition is that of finding a comfortable position,  _i.e._, a position of equilibrium. As they are seated for this  exercise, they must therefore make themselves comfortable either in  their little chairs or on the ground. When immobility is obtained, the  room is half-darkened, or else the children close their eyes, or cover  them with their hands.    It is quite plain to see that the children take a great interest in  the \"Silence\"; they seem to give themselves up to a kind of spell:  they might be said to be wrapped in meditation. Little by little, as  each child, watching himself, becomes more and more still, the silence  deepens till it becomes absolute and can be felt, just as the  twilight gradually deepens whilst the sun is setting.    Then it is that slight sounds, unnoticed before, are heard; the  ticking of the clock, the chirp of a sparrow in the garden, the flight  of a butterfly. The world becomes full of imperceptible sounds which  invade that deep silence without disturbing it, just as the stars  shine out in the dark sky without banishing the darkness of the night.  It is almost the discovery of a new world where there is rest. It is,  as it were, the twilight of the world of loud noises and of the uproar  that oppresses the spirit. At such a time the spirit is set free and  opens out like the corolla of the convolvulus.    And leaving metaphor for the reality of facts, can we not all recall  feelings that have possessed us at sunset, when all the vivid  impressions of the day, the brightness and clamor, are silenced? It is  not that we miss the day, but that our spirit expands. It becomes more  sensitive to the inner play of emotions, strong and persistent, or  changeful and serene.        \"It was that hour when mariners feel longing,       And hearts grow tender.\"                  (Dante, trans. Longfellow.)    The lesson of silence ends with a general calling of the children's  names. The teacher, or one of the children, takes her place behind the  class or in an adjoining room, and \"calls\" the motionless children,  one by one, by name; the call is made in a whisper, that is, without  vocal sound. This demands a close attention on the part of the child,  if he is to hear his name. When his name is called he must rise and  find his way to the voice which called him; his movements must be  light and vigilant, and so controlled _as to make no noise_.    When the children have become acquainted with _silence_, their hearing  is in a manner refined for the perception of sounds. Those sounds  which are too loud become gradually displeasing to the ear of one who  has known the pleasure of silence, and has discovered the world of  delicate sounds. From this point the children gradually go on to  perfect themselves; they walk lightly, take care not to knock against  the furniture, move their chairs without noise, and place things upon  the table with great care. The result of this is seen in the grace of  carriage and of movement, which is especially delightful on account of  the way in which it has been brought about. It is not a grace taught  externally for the sake of beauty or regard for the world, but one  which is born of the pleasure felt by the spirit in immobility and  silence. The soul of the child wishes to free itself from the  irksomeness of sounds that are too loud, from obstacles to its peace  during work. These children, with the grace of pages to a noble lord,  are serving their spirits.    This exercise develops very definitely the social spirit. No other  lesson, no other \"situation,\" could do the same. A profound silence  can be obtained even when more than fifty children are crowded  together in a small space, provided that _all_ the children know how  to keep still and want to do it; but one disturber is enough to take  away the charm.    Here is demonstration of the cooperation of all the members of a  community to achieve a common end. The children gradually show  increased power of _inhibition_; many of them, rather than disturb the  silence, refrain from brushing a fly off the nose, or suppress a cough  or sneeze. The same exhibition of collective action is seen in the  care with which the children move to avoid making a noise during their  work. The lightness with which they run on tiptoe, the grace with  which they shut a cupboard, or lay an object on the table, these are  qualities that must be _acquired by all_, if the environment is to  become tranquil and free from disturbance. One rebel is sufficient to  mar this achievement; one noisy child, walking on his heels or banging  the door, can disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the small community.          LANGUAGE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD      The special importance of the sense of hearing comes from the fact  that it is the sense organ connected with speech. Therefore, to train  the child's attention to follow sounds and noises which are produced  in the environment, to recognize them and to discriminate between  them, is to prepare his attention to follow more accurately the sounds  of articulate language. The teacher must be careful to pronounce  clearly and completely the sounds of the word when she speaks to a  child, even though she may be speaking in a low voice, almost as if  telling him a secret. The children's songs are also a good means for  obtaining exact pronunciation. The teacher, when she teaches them,  pronounces slowly, separating the component sounds of the word  pronounced.    But a special opportunity for training in clear and exact speech  occurs when the lessons are given in the nomenclature relating to the  sensory exercises. In every exercise, when the child has _recognized_  the differences between the qualities of the objects, the teacher  fixes the idea of this quality with a word. Thus, when the child has  many times built and rebuilt the tower of the pink cubes, at an  opportune moment the teacher draws near him, and taking the two  extreme cubes, the largest and the smallest, and showing them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#9)"],[1,". Set the  skull upon a cut-out base-board as shown in Fig. 38.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]    Drive nails half in all around back and side edges of this base-board  and wrap on filling of excelsior for jaws and flare of neck. Drive the  nails down tight after wrapping is completed.    Mount the head before stretching the skin. Relax the head with water and  poison same as deer scalp.    Use plaster and glue-water compo. as in raw deer scalp. If a snarling  expression is desired, model the wrinkles on the muzzle with an edged  wooden tool. Tuck the lip lining well under the filling, so they will  hold in place when the plaster is set. Finish details of face same as in  other mounting.    Finish the tongue and gums by melting colored wax and cotton upon core  and bone with hot iron, modeling and carving to shape when cool. After  the head is mounted and set, stretch the skin. Moisten the flesh side to  soften it up well.    Nail down the rear end upon floor to its widest spread, with hind legs  pointing back on a slight slant. Draw the skin forward and spread  forelegs and front end to widest extent and nail down in accurate line  with hind part. Now work from side to side, nailing skin out to its  widest extent and in symmetrical lines. Always stretch a rug-skin hair  side down. A slight wash of arsenic-water may be applied after the skin  is stretched and while yet moist, care being used not to mess the hair  with the solution.    When dry, the skin is ready to line. Lay the felt lining upon the floor  and the skin upon it and cut around the skin, allowing three or four  inches for pinked edge.    With a pinking iron cut scalloped edge and enough of a narrow strip to  gather fully all around just inside the outer edge. Lay skin on lining  and mark its edge with tailor's chalk. Sew the gathered edge just inside  this chalk mark so that the stitch will be covered by the skin.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]    Quilt skin upon the lining with a good layer of cotton wadding between.  Be sure and not draw down a bunch of hair under each loop. Tie the  knots neatly on under side.    Fig. 39 shows incisions to make in removing a pelt for a symmetrical  rug. Rug skins are best dried with no preservative whatever. In drying  skins, stretch them symmetrically and dry in the shade.    [Illustration]          PREPARING AND MOUNTING A COYOTE          CHAPTER VI    PREPARING AND MOUNTING A COYOTE      This method may be applied to specimens from the size of a red fox or a  bobcat up to a timber wolf. Remove the skin and prepare it in same way  as that of a small mammal for mounting. When the carcass is bared in  skinning, measure the girth of the neck at middle and at base; of the  chest just behind the forelegs; the abdomen at its middle; the upper-arm  at middle; the forearm just below elbow; the thigh at middle; the shank  just below swell of thigh muscles back of knee, and the tail near its  base. (See Fig. 40 for measurements.)    Lay the carcass upon a large piece of wrapping paper and take an outline  of it complete, both before and after skinning.    Use same incisions and remove skin identically as in small specimen.  Upon the outline sketch of peeled complete carcass set down the girth  measurements in their proper places as taken with the tape. As in  smaller specimens, these outline sketches will be found of great value  as an aid to preserving natural lines in mounting.    [Illustration: Fig. 40.]    Wire the leg bones same as in a small mammal, using soft iron rod of  sufficient size to support the specimen firmly. In our coyote a  quarter-inch rod will be required. In a bobcat a three-sixteenths-inch  rod will be large enough to support sturdily.    Bend the leg rods to fit the joints in position desired. Cut the rods of  a length so that six or eight inches will protrude from the feet and  eight or ten inches will remain free above to anchor to the body core.  Bind the rods to the leg-bones with strong, light cord, doing the  firmest wrapping near the joints.    Working over the body outline, cut a one-inch-thick board core that will  set well within the outline. (See Fig. 41.)    [Illustration: Fig. 41.]    Cut a neck-rod of same size as for legs, having it twice as long as neck  and head. Near one end of the neck-rod bend a jog to hold well when set  with plaster of paris and chopped fiber into the brain cavity of the  cleaned skull.    Wrap the leg muscles upon the bones same as in a small specimen, except  pull the excelsior rather smooth for the purpose instead of rolling it  in the palms. Make the Achilles tendon in same way and leave back of  thigh off to be stuffed.    When the plaster to hold neck-rod in head is set, anchor the skull by  the rod to the core-board in proper relation to the body. To do this,  run the rod through a hole drilled through the board, clinch rod down  forward and back with a hammer on anvil or vise, and fasten with  staples, or drill a small hole through core-board each side of rod and  tie the rod down with a strong loop of wire twisted down with the  pliers.    Wrap the skull muscles on with excelsior rolled in palms of hands. Wrap  a tail of pulled excelsior laid straight along a wire much smaller than  is used in legs.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.]    Drill the center-board for legs and tail as shown in Fig. 42, which  shows general assembling details. When the legs, head, and tail are  finished, push the head and body-core into place in the skin, shove in  the legs and tail, and wire the legs and tail fast in the center-board  same as head was fastened.    The remainder of the mounting is accomplished in exactly the same way as  the filling and finishing of a small mammal specimen, _i. e._, by  stuffing the neck, body, and back of thighs and finishing the face and  feet with a batch of papier-mache compo. No. 2. If the mouth is to be  open, follow directions given for finishing an entire rug-head.    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    To hold in the hollow of the flanks, cut several short, strong pieces of  wire, sharpen them to cutting points, push them through the skin along  line of hollow in front of hip, drive them firmly into the core-board,  and then, with cutting pliers clinch their ends down to hold the skin in  and cut off surplus wire, picking the fur out well to cover them. (See  Fig. 43.)    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]    To support the compo.-filled ears until set and dry, drive a sharpened  wire into the head, through hollow of ear. Point the wire in direction  ear is to lay or stand and between ear and wire lay a loose, flat wad of  cotton or tow. With a furrier's needle and thread take a narrow loop  through center of ear near tip and tie lightly around wire to hold  until dry. When dry remove the thread with scissors and the wires by a  slight twist with pliers.    Mammals of the sizes named may be mounted so skillfully by this method  that they cannot be told from mannikin specimens.    Specimens of this size need not be entirely mounted at one sitting.  Prepare the skin, wire and wrap the legs and head, and make the  center-board in one day, assemble the specimen and place the body  filling the next day, and make the feet, mount the specimen, and finish  the head the third day.    A little carbolic acid in the arsenic-water will help keep the skin from  slipping the hair. Also keep unfinished parts wrapped in damp cloths  wrung from carbolic acid water.

Dr. Hutchinson takes  the common-sense view that the greatest problem in exercise for most of  us is to get enough of the right kind. The greatest error in exercise is  not to take enough, and the greatest danger in athletics is in giving  them up. He writes in a direct matter-of-fact manner with an avoidance  of medical terms, and a strong emphasis on the rational, all-around  manner of living that is best calculated to bring a man to a ripe old  age with little illness or consciousness of bodily weakness.    2.
