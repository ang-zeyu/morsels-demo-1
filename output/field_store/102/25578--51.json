Had this secret society to do with politics?\"    \"No, he cared nothing about politics.\"    \"You have no reason to think it was criminal?\"    \"On the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.\"    \"Was there anything curious about his life in California?\"    \"He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He  would never go where other men were if he could help it. That's why I  first thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly  for Europe I made sure that it was so. I believe that he had a warning  of some sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were  inquiring for him.\"    \"What sort of men?\"    \"Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim  and wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe  and that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good--it  was easy to see that.\"    \"Were these men Americans--Californians?\"    \"Well, I don't know about Californians. They were Americans, all right.  But they were not miners. I don't know what they were, and was very glad  to see their backs.\"    \"That was six years ago?\"    \"Nearer seven.\"    \"And then you were together five years in California, so that this  business dates back not less than eleven years at the least?\"    \"That is so.\"    \"It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such  earnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would  give rise to it.\"    \"I think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his  mind.\"    \"But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't  you think he would turn to the police for protection?\"    \"Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against.  There's one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His  revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his  dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge  was up, I guess he thought he was safe.\"    \"I should like these dates a little clearer,\" said MacDonald. \"It is  quite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next  year, did you not?\"    \"That is so.\"    \"And he had been married five years. You must have returned about the  time of his marriage.\"    \"About a month before. I was his best man.\"    \"Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?\"    \"No, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.\"    \"But you have seen a good deal of her since.\"    Barker looked sternly at the detective. \"I have seen a good deal of HIM  since,\" he answered. \"If I have seen her, it is because you cannot  visit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is any  connection--\"    \"I imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which  can bear upon the case. But I mean no offense.\"    \"Some inquiries are offensive,\" Barker answered angrily.    \"It's only the facts that we want. It is in your interest and everyone's  interest that they should be cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas entirely  approve your friendship with his wife?\"    Barker grew paler, and his great, strong hands were clasped convulsively  together. \"You have no right to ask such questions!\" he cried. \"What has  this to do with the matter you are investigating?\"    \"I must repeat the question.\"    \"Well, I refuse to answer.\"    \"You can refuse to answer; but you must be aware that your refusal is in  itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something to  conceal.\"    Barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black  eyebrows drawn low in intense thought. Then he looked up with a smile.  \"Well, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all,  and I have no right to stand in the way of it. I'd only ask you not to  worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just  now. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world,  and that was his jealousy. He was fond of me--no man could be fonder of  a friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and  was forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together or  there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy would  pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest  things in a moment. More than once I've sworn off coming for that  reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring letters that  I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if it was my last  word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful wife--and I can say  also no friend could be more loyal than I!\"    It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald  could not dismiss the subject.    \"You are aware,\" said he, \"that the dead man's wedding ring has been  taken from his finger?\"    \"So it appears,\" said Barker.    \"What do you mean by 'appears'? You know it as a fact.\"    The man seemed confused and undecided. \"When I said 'appears' I meant  that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.\"    \"The mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed  it, would suggest to anyone's mind, would it not, that the marriage and  the tragedy were connected?\"    Barker shrugged his broad shoulders. \"I can't profess to say what it  means,\" he answered. \"But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in  any way upon this lady's honour\"--his eyes blazed for an instant, and  then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions--\"well,  you are on the wrong track, that's all.\"    \"I don't know that I've anything else to ask you at present,\" said  MacDonald, coldly.    \"There was one small point,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes. \"When you entered  the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was there not?\"    \"Yes, that was so.\"    \"By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"You at once rang for help?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And it arrived very speedily?\"    \"Within a minute or so.\"    \"And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that  the lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.\"    Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. \"I don't see that it was  remarkable, Mr. Holmes,\" he answered after a pause. \"The candle threw a  very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was  on the table; so I lit it.\"    \"And blew out the candle?\"    \"Exactly.\"    Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look  from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of  defiance in it, turned and left the room.    Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait  upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet  us in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman  of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very  different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is  true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured  a great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand  which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own.  Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a  curiously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed  itself suddenly into abrupt speech.    \"Have you found anything out yet?\" she asked.    Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of  hope in the question?    \"We have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,\" said the inspector.  \"You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.\"    \"Spare no money,\" she said in a dead, even tone. \"It is my desire that  every possible effort should be made.\"    \"Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the  matter.\"    \"I fear not; but all I know is at your service.\"    \"We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see--that  you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?\"    \"No, he turned me back upon the stairs. He begged me to return to my  room.\"    \"Quite so. You had heard the shot, and you had at once come down.\"    \"I put on my dressing gown and then came down.\"    \"How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the  stair by Mr. Barker?\"    \"It may have been a couple of minutes. It is so hard to reckon time at  such a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could  do nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It  was all like some dreadful dream.\"    \"Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs  before you heard the shot?\"    \"No, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear  him go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous of  fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.\"    \"That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have  known your husband only in England, have you not?\"    \"Yes, we have been married five years.\"    \"Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and  might bring some danger upon him?\"    Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. \"Yes,\" she said at  last, \"I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He  refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in  me--there was the most complete love and confidence between us--but  it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I  should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.\"    \"How did you know it, then?\"    Mrs. Douglas's face lit with a quick smile. \"Can a husband ever carry  about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion  of it? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his  American life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by  certain words he let fall.

Moreover, when it  came to legislation concerning the Supreme Court, the majority of the  Republicans again displayed genuine moderation, for, thrusting aside  an obvious temptation to swamp that tribunal with additional judges of  their own creed, they merely restored it to its original size under the  Act of 1789.    Nevertheless the most significant aspect in the repeal of the Act of the  13th of February was the fact itself. The Republicans had not shown  a more flagrant partisanism in effecting this repeal than had the  Federalists in originally enacting the measure which was now at an end.  Though the Federalists had sinned first, the fact nevertheless remained  that in realizing their purpose the Republican majority had established  a precedent which threatened to make of the lower Federal Judiciary the  merest cat's-paw of party convenience. The attitude of the Republican  leaders was even more menacing, for it touched the security of the  Supreme Court itself in the enjoyment of its highest prerogative and so  imperiled the unity of the nation. Beyond any doubt the moment was now  at hand when the Court must prove to its supporters that it was still  worth defending and to all that the Constitution had an authorized final  interpreter. Marshall's first constitutional case was that of Marbury  vs. Madison. * The facts of this famous litigation are simple. On March  2, 1801, William Marbury had been nominated by President Adams to the  office of Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia for five  years; his nomination had been ratified by the Senate; his commission  had been signed and sealed; but it had not yet been delivered when  Jefferson took office. The new President ordered Madison, his Secretary  of State, not to deliver the commission. Marbury then applied to the  Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to the Secretary of State under  the supposed authorization of the thirteenth section of the Act of 1789,  which empowered the Court to issue the writ \"in cases warranted by  the principles and usages of law to... persons holding office under the  authority of the United States.\" The Court at first took jurisdiction  of the case and issued a rule to the Secretary of State ordering him  to show cause, but it ultimately dismissed the suit for want  of jurisdiction on the ground that the thirteenth section was  unconstitutional.       * 1 Cranch, 137. The following account of the case is drawn  largely upon my \"Doctrine of Judicial Review\" (Princeton, 1914).      Such are the lawyer's facts of the case; it is the historian's facts  about it which are today the interesting and instructive ones.  Marshall, reversing the usual order of procedure, left the question  of jurisdiction till the very last, and so created for himself an  opportunity to lecture the President on his duty to obey the law and to  deliver the commission. Marshall based his homily on the questionable  assumption that the President had not the power to remove Marbury from  office, for if he had this power the nondelivery of the document was of  course immaterial. Marshall's position was equally questionable when he  contended that the thirteenth section violated that clause of Article  III of the Constitution which gives the Supreme Court original  jurisdiction \"in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public  ministers, and consuls, and those in which a State shall be party.\"  These words, urged the Chief Justice, must be given an exclusive sense  \"or they have no operation at all.\" This position is quite untenable,  for even when given only their affirmative value these words still place  the cases enumerated beyond the reach of Congress, and this may have  been their only purpose. However, granting the Chief Justice his view of  Article III, still we are not forced to challenge the validity of what  Congress had done. For the view taken a little later by the Court was  that it was not the intention of Congress by this language to confer any  jurisdiction at all, but only to give the right to issue the writ where  the jurisdiction already existed. What the Court should have done,  allowing its view of Article III to have been correct, was to dismiss  the case as not falling within the contemplation of section thirteen,  and not on the ground of the unconstitutionality of that section.    Marshall's opinion in Marbury vs. Madison was a political coup of the  first magnitude, and by it he achieved half a dozen objects, some of  the greatest importance. In the first place, while avoiding a direct  collision with the executive power, he stigmatized his enemy Jefferson  as a violator of the laws which as President he was sworn to support.  Again, he evaded the perilous responsibility of passing upon the  validity of the recent Repeal Act in quo warranto proceedings, such as  were then being broached. * For if the Supreme Court could not issue the  writ of mandamus in suits begun in it by individuals, neither could it  issue the writ of quo warranto in such suits. Yet again Marshall  scored in exhibiting the Court in the edifying and reassuring light of  declining, even from the hands of Congress, jurisdiction to which it was  not entitled by the Constitution, an attitude of self-restraint which  emphasized tremendously the Court's claim to the function of judicial  review, now first definitely registered in deliberate judicial decision.       * See Benton's \"Abridgment of the Debates of Congress,\" vol. II,  pp. 665-68. Marshall expressed the opinion in private that the repealing  act was \"operative in depriving the judges of all power derived from the  act repealed\" but not their office, \"which is a mere capacity, without  new appointment, to receive and exercise any new judicial power which  the legislature may confer.\" Quoted by W. S. Carpenter in \"American  Political Science Review,\" vol. IX, p. 528.      At this point in Marshall's handling of the case the consummate debater  came to the assistance of the political strategist. Every one of his  arguments in this opinion in support of judicial review will be found  anticipated in the debate on the Repeal Act. What Marshall did was to  gather these arguments together, winnow them of their trivialities,  inconsistencies, and irrelevancies, and compress the residuum into a  compact presentation of the case which marches to its conclusion with  all the precision of a demonstration from Euclid.    The salient passages of this part of his opinion are the following:    \"[In the United States] the powers of the legislature are defined and  limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the  Constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what  purpose is that limitation committed in writing if these limits may, at  any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction  between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if  those limits do not confine the persons on which they are imposed, and  if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a  proposition too plain to be contested: that the Constitution controls  any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter  the Constitution by an ordinary act.    \"[If, then,] an act of the legislature, repugnant to the Constitution,  is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and  oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law,  does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be  to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at  first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however,  receive a more attentive consideration.    \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to  say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must  of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with  each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a  law be in opposition to the Constitution; if both the law and the  Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either  decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution,  or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the court must  determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of  the very essence of judicial duty.    \"[However, there are those who maintain] that courts must close their  eyes on the Constitution, and see only the law.... This doctrine would  subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would  declare that an act which, according to the principles and theory of  our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely  obligatory. It would declare that if the legislature shall do what is  expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition,  is in reality effectual.    \"[Moreover,] the peculiar expressions of the Constitution of the United  States furnish additional arguments in favor of its rejection. The  judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising  under the Constitution. Could it be the intention of those who gave this  power, to say that in using it the Constitution should not be looked  into? That a case arising under the Constitution should be decided  without examining the instrument under which it arises? This is too  extravagant to be maintained.    \"In some cases, then, the Constitution must be looked into by the  judges. And if they can open it at all, what part of it are they  forbidden to read or to obey? There are many other parts of the  Constitution which serve to illustrate this subject.... 'No person,'  says the Constitution, 'shall be convicted of treason unless "]]]
