In its outward motion the flying body deviates neither to the right nor  left. It is safe to say that, if any deviation is to take place,  thousands of years will be required for our terrestrial observers to  recognize it.    Rapid as the course of these objects is, the distances which we have  described are such that, in the great majority of cases, all the  observations yet made on the positions of the stars fail to show any  well-established motion. It is only in the case of the nearer of these  objects that we can expect any motion to be perceptible during the  period, in no case exceeding one hundred and fifty years, through which  accurate observations extend. The efforts of all the observatories  which engage in such work are, up to the present time, unequal to the  task of grappling with the motions of all the stars that can be seen  with the instruments, and reaching a decision as to the proper motion  in each particular case. As the question now stands, the aim of the  astronomer is to determine what stars have proper motions large enough  to be well established. To make our statement on this subject clear, it  must be understood that by this term the astronomer does not mean the  speed of a star in space, but its angular motion as he observes it on  the celestial sphere. A star moving forward with a given speed will  have a greater proper motion according as it is nearer to us. To avoid  all ambiguity, we shall use the term \"speed\" to express the velocity in  miles per second with which such a body moves through space, and the  term \"proper motion\" to express the apparent angular motion which the  astronomer measures upon the celestial sphere.    Up to the present time, two stars have been found whose proper motions  are so large that, if continued, the bodies would make a complete  circuit of the heavens in less than 200,000 years. One of these would  require about 160,000; the other about 180,000 years for the circuit.  Of other stars having a rapid motion only about one hundred would  complete their course in less than a million of years.    Quite recently a system of observations upon stars to the ninth  magnitude has been nearly carried through by an international  combination of observatories. The most important conclusion from these  observations relates to the distribution of the stars with reference to  the Milky Way, which we have already described. We have shown that  stars of every magnitude, bright and faint, show a tendency to crowd  towards this belt. It is, therefore, remarkable that no such tendency  is seen in the case of those stars which have proper motions large  enough to be accurately determined. So far as yet appears, such stars  are equally scattered over the heavens, without reference to the course  of the Milky Way. The conclusion is obvious. These stars are all inside  the girdle of the Milky Way, and within the sphere which contains them  the distribution in space is approximately uniform. At least there is  no well-marked condensation in the direction of the galaxy nor any  marked thinning out towards its poles. What can we say as to the extent  of this sphere?    To answer this question, we have to consider whether there is any  average or ordinary speed that a star has in space. A great number of  motions in the line of sight--that is to say, in the direction of the  line from us to the star--have been measured with great precision by  Campbell at the Lick Observatory, and by other astronomers. The  statistical investigations of Kaptoyn also throw much light on the  subject. The results of these investigators agree well in showing an  average speed in space--a straight-ahead motion we may call it--of  twenty-one miles per second. Some stars may move more slowly than this  to any extent; others more rapidly. In two or three cases the speed  exceeds one hundred miles per second, but these are quite exceptional.  By taking several thousand stars having a given proper motion, we may  form a general idea of their average distance, though a great number of  them will exceed this average to a considerable extent. The conclusion  drawn in this way would be that the stars having an apparent proper  motion of 10\" per century or more are mostly contained within, or lie  not far outside of a sphere whose surface is at a distance from us of  200 light-years. Granting the volume of space which we have shown that  nature seems to allow to each star, this sphere should contain 27,000  stars in all. There are about 10,000 stars known to have so large a  proper motion as 10\". But there is no actual discordance between these  results, because not only are there, in all probability, great numbers  of stars of which the proper motion is not yet recognized, but there  are within the sphere a great number of stars whose motion is less than  the average. On the other hand, it is probable that a considerable  number of the 10,000 stars lie at a distance at least one-half greater  than that of the radius of the sphere.    On the whole, it seems likely that, out to a distance of 300 or even  400 light-years, there is no marked inequality in star distribution. If  we should explore the heavens to this distance, we should neither find  the beginning of the Milky Way in one direction nor a very marked  thinning out in the other. This conclusion is quite accordant with the  probabilities of the case. If all the stars which form the groundwork  of the Milky Way should be blotted out, we should probably find  100,000,000, perhaps even more, remaining. Assigning to each star the  space already shown to be its quota, we should require a sphere of  about 3000 light-years radius to contain such a number of stars. At  some such distance as this, we might find a thinning out of the stars  in the direction of the galactic poles, or the commencement of the  Milky Way in the direction of this stream.    Even if this were not found at the distance which we have supposed, it  is quite certain that, at some greater distance, we should at least  find that the region of the Milky Way is richer in stars than the  region near the galactic poles. There is strong reason, based on the  appearance of the stars of the Milky Way, their physical constitution,  and their magnitudes as seen in the telescope, to believe that, were we  placed on one of these stars, we should find the stars around us to be  more thickly strewn than they are around our system. In other words,  the quota of space filled by each star is probably less in the region  of the Milky Way than it is near the centre where we seem to be  situated.    We are, therefore, presented with what seems to be the most  extraordinary spectacle that the universe can offer, a ring of stars  spanning it, and including within its limits by far the great majority  of the stars within our system. We have in this spectacle another  example of the unity which seems to pervade the system. We might  imagine the latter so arranged as to show diversity to any extent. We  might have agglomerations of stars like those of the Milky Way situated  in some corner of the system, or at its centre, or scattered through it  here and there in every direction. But such is not the case. There are,  indeed, a few star-clusters scattered here and there through the  system; but they are essentially different from the clusters of the  Milky Way, and cannot be regarded as forming an important part of the  general plan. In the case of the galaxy we have no such scattering, but  find the stars built, as it were, into this enormous ring, having  similar characteristics throughout nearly its whole extent, and having  within it a nearly uniform scattering of stars, with here and there  some collected into clusters. Such, to our limited vision, now appears  the universe as a whole.    We have already alluded to the conclusion that an absolutely infinite  system of stars would cause the entire heavens to be filled with a  blaze of light as bright as the sun. It is also true that the  attractive force within such a universe would be infinitely great in  some direction or another. But neither of these considerations enables  us to set a limit to the extent of our system. In two remarkable papers  by Lord Kelvin which have recently appeared, the one being an address  before the British Association at its Glasgow meeting, in 1901, are  given the results of some numerical computations pertaining to this  subject. Granting that the stars are scattered promiscuously through  space with some approach to uniformity in thickness, and are of a known  degree of brilliancy, it is easy to compute how far out the system must  extend in order that, looking up at the sky, we shall see a certain  amount of light coming from the invisible stars. Granting that, in the  general average, each star is as bright as the sun, and that their  thickness is such that within a sphere of 3300 light-years there are  1,000,000,000 stars, if we inquire how far out such a system must be  continued in order that the sky shall shine with even four per cent of  the light of the sun, we shall find the distance of its boundary so  great that millions of millions of years would be required for the  light of the outer stars to reach the centre of the system. In view of  the fact that this duration in time far exceeds what seems to be the  possible life duration of a star, so far as our knowledge of it can  extend, the mere fact that the sky does not glow with any such  brightness proves little or nothing as to the extent of the system.    We may, however, replace these purely negative considerations by  inquiring how much light we actually get from the invisible stars of  our system. Here we can make a definite statement. Mark out a small  circle in the sky 1 degree in diameter. The quantity of light which we  receive on a cloudless and moonless night from the sky within this  circle admits of actual determination."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#9)"],[1,"which the preceding centuries had already made the preparation. The  story of the voyages of Columbus forms no part of our present  narrative. But we cannot understand the background that lies behind the  history of Canada without knowing why such men as Christopher Columbus  and Vasco da Gama and the Cabots began the work of discovery.    First, we have to realize the peculiar relations between Europe,  ancient and mediaeval, and the great empires of Eastern Asia. The two  civilizations had never been in direct contact. Yet in a sense they  were always connected. The Greeks and the Romans had at least vague  reports of peoples who lived on the far eastern confines of the world,  beyond even the conquests of Alexander the Great in Hindustan. It is  certain, too, that Europe and Asia had always traded with one another  in a strange and unconscious fashion. The spices and silks of the  unknown East passed westward from trader to trader, from caravan to  caravan, until they reached the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and, at  last, the Mediterranean. The journey was so slow, so tedious, the goods  passed from hand to hand so often, that when the Phoenician, Greek, or  Roman merchants bought them their origin had been forgotten. For  century after century this trade continued. When Rome fell, other  peoples of the Mediterranean continued the Eastern trade. Genoa and  Venice rose to greatness by this trade. As wealth and culture revived  after the Gothic conquest which overthrew Rome, the beautiful silks and  the rare spices of the East were more and more prized in a world of  increasing luxury. The Crusades rediscovered Egypt, Syria, and the East  for Europe. Gold and jewels, diamond-hilted swords of Damascus steel,  carved ivory, and priceless gems,--all the treasures which the warriors  of the Cross brought home, helped to impress on the mind of Europe the  surpassing riches of the East.    Gradually a new interest was added. As time went on doubts increased  regarding the true shape of the earth. Early peoples had thought it a  great flat expanse, with the blue sky propped over it like a dome or  cover. This conception was giving way. The wise men who watched the sky  at night, who saw the sweeping circles of the fixed stars and the  wandering path of the strange luminous bodies called planets, began to  suspect a mighty secret,--that the observing eye saw only half the  heavens, and that the course of the stars and the earth itself rounded  out was below the darkness of the horizon. From this theory that the  earth was a great sphere floating in space followed the most  enthralling conclusions. If the earth was really a globe, it might be  possible to go round it and to reappear on the farther side of the  horizon. Then the East might be reached, not only across the deserts of  Persia and Tartary, but also by striking out into the boundless ocean  that lay beyond the Pillars of Hercules. For such an attempt an almost  superhuman courage was required. No man might say what awful seas, what  engulfing gloom, might lie across the familiar waters which washed the  shores of Europe. The most fearless who, at evening, upon the cliffs of  Spain or Portugal, watched black night settle upon the far-spreading  waters of the Atlantic, might well turn shuddering from any attempt to  sail into those unknown wastes.    It was the stern logic of events which compelled the enterprise.  Barbarous Turks swept westward. Arabia, Syria, the Isles of Greece,  and, at last, in 1453, Constantinople itself, fell into their hands.  The Eastern Empire, the last survival of the Empire of the Romans,  perished beneath the sword of Mahomet. Then the pathway by land to  Asia, to the fabled empires of Cathay and Cipango, was blocked by the  Turkish conquest. Commerce, however, remained alert and enterprising,  and men's minds soon turned to the hopes of a western passage which  should provide a new route to the Indies.    All the world knows the story of Christopher Columbus, his long years  of hardship and discouragement; the supreme conviction which sustained  him in his adversity; the final triumph which crowned his efforts. It  is no detraction from the glory of Columbus to say that he was only one  of many eager spirits occupied with new problems of discovery across  the sea. Not the least of these were John and Sebastian Cabot, father  and son. John Cabot, like Columbus, was a Genoese by birth; a long  residence in Venice, however, earned for him in 1476 the citizenship of  that republic. Like many in his time, he seems to have been both a  scientific geographer and a practical sea-captain. At one time he made  charts and maps for his livelihood. Seized with the fever for  discovery, he is said to have begged in vain from the sovereigns of  Spain and Portugal for help in a voyage to the West. About the time of  the great discovery of Columbus in 1492, John Cabot arrived in Bristol.  It may be that he took part in some of the voyages of the Bristol  merchants, before the achievements of Columbus began to startle the  world.    At the close of the fifteenth century the town of Bristol enjoyed a  pre-eminence which it has since lost. It stood second only to London as  a British port. A group of wealthy merchants carried on from Bristol a  lively trade with Iceland and the northern ports of Europe. The town  was the chief centre for an important trade in codfish. Days of fasting  were generally observed at that time; on these the eating of meat was  forbidden by the church, and fish was consequently in great demand. The  merchants of Bristol were keen traders, and were always seeking the  further extension of their trade. Christopher Columbus himself is said  to have made a voyage for the Bristol merchants to Iceland in 1477.  There is even a tale that, before Columbus was known to fame, an  expedition was equipped there in 1480 to seek the 'fabulous islands' of  the Western Sea. Certain it is that the Spanish ambassador in England,  whose business it was to keep his royal master informed of all that was  being done by his rivals, wrote home in 1498: 'It is seven years since  those of Bristol used to send out, every year, a fleet of two, three,  or four caravels to go and search for the Isle of Brazil and the Seven  Cities, according to the fancy of the Genoese.'    We can therefore realize that when Master John Cabot came among the  merchants of this busy town with his plans he found a ready hearing.  Cabot was soon brought to the notice of his august majesty Henry VII of  England. The king had been shortsighted enough to reject overtures made  to him by Bartholomew Columbus, brother of Christopher, and no doubt he  regretted his mistake. Now he was eager enough to act as the patron of  a new voyage. Accordingly, on March 5, 1496, he granted a royal licence  in the form of what was called Letters Patent, authorizing John Cabot  and his sons Lewis, Sebastian and Sancius to make a voyage of discovery  in the name of the king of England. The Cabots were to sail 'with five  ships or vessels of whatever burden or quality soever they be, and with  as many marines or men as they will have with them in the said ships  upon their own proper costs and charges.' It will be seen that Henry  VII, the most parsimonious of kings, had no mind to pay the expense of  the voyage. The expedition was 'to seek out, discover and find  whatsoever islands, countries, regions and provinces of the heathens or  infidels, in whatever part of the world they be, which before this time  have been unknown to all Christians.' It was to sail only 'to the seas  of the east and west and north,' for the king did not wish to lay any  claim to the lands discovered by the Spaniards and Portuguese. The  discoverers, however, were to raise the English flag over any new lands  that they found, to conquer and possess them, and to acquire 'for us  dominion, title, and jurisdiction over those towns, castles, islands,  and mainlands so discovered.' One-fifth of the profits from the  anticipated voyages to the new land was to fall to the king, but the  Cabots were to have a monopoly of trade, and Bristol was to enjoy the  right of being the sole port of entry for the ships engaged in this  trade.    Not until the next year, 1497, did John Cabot set out. Then he embarked  from Bristol with a single ship, called in an old history the Matthew,  and a crew of eighteen men. First, he sailed round the south of  Ireland, and from there struck out westward into the unknown sea. The  appliances of navigation were then very imperfect. Sailors could reckon  the latitude by looking up at the North Star, and noting how high it  was above the horizon. Since the North Star stands in the sky due  north, and the axis on which the earth spins points always towards it,  it will appear to an observer in the northern hemisphere to be as many  degrees above the horizon as he himself is distant from the pole or top  of the earth. The old navigators, therefore, could always tell how far  north or south they were. Moreover, as long as the weather was clear  they could, by this means, strike, at night at least, a course due east  or west. But when the weather was not favourable for observations they  had to rely on the compass alone. Now the compass in actual fact does  not always and everywhere point due north. It is subject to variation,  and in different times and places points either considerably east of  north or west of it. In the path where Cabot sailed, the compass  pointed west of north; and hence, though he thought he was sailing  straight west from Ireland, he was really pursuing a curved path bent  round a little towards the south. This fact will become of importance  when we consider where it was that Cabot landed. For finding distance  east and west the navigators of the fifteenth century had no such  appliances as our modern chronometer and instruments of observation.  They could tell how far"]]]
