See if you can get it.\"    The operator looked up at him beneath a green eyeshade and grinned  crookedly.    \"Talking to 'em now,\" he said.    The key flicked up and down, and a tiny dancing spark leaped into  being and vanished beneath its contact-point. The wireless room was  dark save for the bright, shaded light above the sending table. A file  of sent messages by an elbow. A pad for messages received was by a  hand. Stray wreaths of tobacco smoke floated about the room, leaping  into view as they drifted beneath the lamp.    \"Is he bad?\" asked the operator fascinatedly, his eyes fixed on his  key.    Bell felt his eyelids flicker.    \"Very bad,\" he said shortly.    \"They tell me,\" said the operator and shuddered, \"your hands get  working and you can't stop 'em.... I'm playing, I am! I'm playing The  Master's game!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The key stopped. He listened.    \"They're going to try to swoop over the ship and drop it,\" he said a  moment later. \"I don't think they can. But tell Ortiz they're going to  try.\"    Bell's eyes were narrow. It is not customary for a radio operator on a  passenger ship to speak of an ex-Cabinet Minister of the Argentine  Republic by his surname only. It bespeaks either impertinence or a  certain very peculiar association. Bell frowned imperceptibly for an  instant, thinking.    \"You've--had it?\" he asked sharply.    \"God, no! I never took the chance! I saw the red spots once, and I  went to Rib--Say! You got a password?\"    He was staring up at Bell. Bell shrugged.    \"I'm trying to help Senor Ortiz now.\"    The operator continued to stare, his eyes full of suspicion. Then he  grimaced.    \"All right. Go tell him they're going to drop it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell went out. Gray fog, and washing seas, and the big ship ploughing  steadily on toward the south.... The horn blared, startlingly loud and  unspeakably doleful. Bell listened for other sounds. There were none.    Down the steep ladder to the promenade deck. Paula Canalejas nodded to  him.    \"I saw you speak to Senor Ortiz,\" she said quietly. \"You see?\"    Bell was beginning to have a peculiar, horrible suspicion. It was  incredible, but it was inevitable.    \"I think I see,\" he said harshly. \"But I don't dare believe it. Keep  quiet and don't speak to me unless I give you some sign it's safe!  It's--hellish!\"    He went inside and swiftly down the stairs. He found a steward  hesitating outside the door of Ortiz's cabin. He touched Bell's arm  anxiously as he was about to go in.    \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he said, and stammered. \"I--I heard Mr. Ortiz  making some--very strange noises, sir. I--I thought he was sick....\"    \"He is,\" said Bell grimly. \"He told me he does not want a doctor,  though. I'm looking after him.\"    He closed the door behind him, and Ortiz grinned at him. It was a  horrible, a terrible grin, and Ortiz fought it from his face with a  terrific effort of will. There was foam about his lips.           *       *       *       *       *    \"_Dios!_ It was--it was devilish!\" he gasped. \"Senor Bell, _amigo  mio_, for the love of the good God get my revolver from my trunk. Give  it to me....\"    Bell said shortly: \"The airplane just radioed that it's going to try  to swoop overhead and drop a package on board the steamer. It doesn't  dare alight in this fog.\"    \"I think,\" gasped Ortiz, \"I think it would be well to tie my feet. Tie  them fast! If--if the package comes, if I--if I am unpleasant, knock  me unconscious and pour it into my mouth. I fear it is too late now.  But try it....\"    Through the port came the muttering of a seaplane's engines. The noise  died away. Almost instantly the siren boomed hoarsely.    \"Ah, _Dios!_\" said Ortiz unsteadily. \"There it is! Senor Bell, I think  it is too late. Would you--would you assist me to go out on deck,  where I might fling myself overboard? I--think I can control my legs  so long.\"    \"Steady!\" said Bell, wrenched by the sight of the man before him  fighting against unnameable horror. \"Tell me--\"    \"It is poison,\" said Ortiz, his features fixed in a terrible effort of  will. \"A ghastly, a horrible poison of the _Indios_ of Matto Grosso,  in Brazil. It drives a man mad, murder mad. It is as if he were  possessed by a devil. His hands first refuse to obey him. His feet  next. And then his body. It is as if a devil had seized hold of his  body and carried it about doing murder with it. A part of the brain is  driven insane, and a man goes about shrieking with the horror of what  crimes his body commits until the poison reaches that portion of his  brain as well. Then he is mad forever. That is what I face, _amigo  mio_. That is why I beg you, I implore you, to kill me or assist me to  the side of the ship so that I may fling myself overboard! The Master  had it administered to me secretly, and demanded treason as the price  of the antidote. He deman--\"           *       *       *       *       *    Steady and strong, rising from a muttering to a steady roar, the sound  of airplane motors came through the port. Bell started up.    \"Hold fast,\" he snapped savagely. \"I'll go get that package when it  lands. Hold fast, I tell you! Fight it!\"    He flung out of the cabin and raced up the stairs. The door to the  deck was open. He crowded through a group of passengers who had  discounted the dampness for the sake of a novelty--an airplane far out  at sea--and raced up to the upper deck. The roaring noise was  receding. The siren roared hoarsely. Then the noise came back.    For minutes, then, the ship seemed to play hide-and-seek with the  invisible fliers. The roaring noise overhead circled about, now near,  now seeming very far away. And the siren sent its dismal blasts out  into the grayness all about. Then, for an instant, a swiftly scudding  shadow was visible overhead. It banked steeply and vanished, and  seemed to have turned and come lower when it reappeared a moment  later. It was not distinct, at first. It was merely a silhouette of  darker gray against the all-enveloping mist. But its edges sharpened  and became clear. One could make out struts, an aileron's trailing  edge.    \"Got nerve, anyhow,\" said Bell grimly.    It swept across the ship and disappeared, but the noise of its engines  did not dwindle more than a little. The blast of the siren seemed to  summon it back again. Once more it came in sight, and this time it  dived steeply, flashed across the forecastle deck amid a hideous  uproar, desperately, horribly close to the dangling derrick-cables,  and was gone.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell had seen it more clearly than anyone else on the ship, perhaps.  He saw a man in the pilot's cockpit between wings and tail reach high  and fling something downward, something with a long streamer attached  to it. Bell had an instant's glimpse of the goggled face. Then he was  darting forward, watching the thing that fell.    It took only a second. Two at most. But the thing seemed to fall with  infinite deliberation, the streamer shivering out behind it. It fell  at a steep slant, the forward momentum of the plane's speed added to  its own drop. It swooped down, slanting toward the rail....    Bell groaned. It struck the rail itself, and bounced. A sailor flung  himself toward it. The streamer slipped from his fingers and slithered  over the side.    Bell was at the railing just in time to see it drop into the water. He  opened his mouth to shout, and saw it sink. The last of the streamer  followed the dropped object down into the green water when it was  directly below him.    His hands clenched. Bell stared sickly at the spot where it had  vanished. An instant later he had whirled and was thrusting wide the  wireless room door. The operator was returning to his key, grinning  crookedly. He looked up sidewise.    \"Tell them it went overside,\" snapped Bell. \"Tell them to try it  again. Ortiz is in hell! To try again! He's dying!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The operator looked up fascinatedly, his fingers working his key.    \"Is he--bad?\" he asked with a shuddering interest.    \"He's dying!\" snarled Bell, in a rage because of his helplessness. He  had forgotten everything but the fact that a man below decks was  facing the most horrible fate that can overtake a man, and facing it  with a steadfast gameness that made Bell's heart go out to him.    \"They don't die,\" said the operator. He shuddered. \"They don't die of  it.\"    His key stopped. He listened. His key clicked again.    \"They only had two packages,\" he said a moment later. \"They don't dare  risk the other one. They say the fog ends twenty miles farther on.  They're going to land up there and taxi back on the surface of the  water. It shouldn't be more than half an hour.\"    He pushed himself back from the table with an air of finality.    \"That's all. They've signed off.\"    Bell felt rage sweeping over him. The operator grinned crookedly.    \"Better go down and tie him up,\" he said, and licked his lips with the  fascinated air of one thinking of a known and terrifying thing.  \"Better tie him up tight. It'll be half an hour more.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell went down the companion-ladder. The promenade was crowded with  passengers now, asking questions of each other. Some, frowning  portentously, thought the plane an unscheduled ocean flier who had  lost his way in the fog.    Paula Canalejas was close to Bell as he shouldered his way through the  crowd.    \"That was for him?\" she asked, without moving her lips.    Bell nodded.    \"Tell him,\" she said quietly, \"I--pray for him.\"    Bell nodded abruptly and went into the saloon. It was nearly empty. He  wiped the sweat off his face. It was horrible to have to go down to  Ortiz and tell him that at best it would be half an hour more....    Then there was a sudden scream below him, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#9)"],[1,"on a thorn or on  a pointed branch the victim he has made, and when it is thus fixed  easily devours it in threads.    The _Lanius collurio_, an allied bird, uses this method still more  frequently. He even prepares a small larder before feasting. One may  thus see on a thorny branch spitted side by side Coleoptera, crickets,  grasshoppers, frogs, and even young birds, which he has seized when  they were in flight.[28] (Fig. 6.)       [28] Naumann, _Naturgeschichte der Voegel Deutschlands,          etc._, Stuttgart, 1846-53.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    Of all these well-attested facts that which perhaps best shows how  animals in certain circumstances may take advantage of a foreign body  to utilise the product of the chase, is the following, the observation  of which is due to Parseval-Deschenes.[29] He followed during several  hours an ant bearing a heavy burden. On arriving at the foot of a  little hillock the animal was unable to mount with his load, and  abandoned it--a very extraordinary fact for one who knows the  inconceivable tenacity of insects. The abandonment therefore left hope  of return. The ant at last met one of his companions, who was also  carrying a burden. They stopped, took counsel for an instant, bringing  their antennae together, and started for the hillock. The second ant  then left his burden, and both together then seized a twig and  introduced its end beneath the first load which had been abandoned  because of its weight. By acting on the free extremity of the twig  they were able to use it exactly as a lever, and succeeded almost  without trouble in passing their booty on to the other side of the  little hillock. It seems to me that these ants who invented the lever  are worthy of admiration, and that their ingenuity does not yield to  our own.       [29] Gratien de Semur, _Traite des erreurs et des          prejuges_, Paris, 1848, p. 70.    I will, finally, give an example of the methods of surmounting a  difficulty of another order in utilising captured prey. It is not  enough to capture prey, or even to possess the means of utilising the  prey when captured. It is sometimes also necessary to prevent the  booty being taken possession of by some other member of the same  species as the hunter. Spiders are specially liable to this danger,  because their victims are noisy when caught. Hudson has described an  ingenious device made use of by a species of _Pholcus_--a quiet  inoffensive Spider found in Buenos Ayres--to escape this risk. This  spider, though large, is a weak creature, and possesses little venom  to despatch a fly quickly. The task of killing it is therefore long  and laborious, and the loud outcries of the victim may be heard for a  long time, sometimes for ten or twelve minutes. The other spiders in  the vicinity are naturally excited by this noise, and hurry out from  their webs to the scene of conflict, and the strongest or most daring  sometimes succeeds in carrying away the fly from its rightful captor.  Where, however, a large colony have been long in undisturbed  possession of a ceiling, when one has caught a fly he rapidly throws a  covering of web over it, cuts it away, and drops it down to hang  suspended by a line at a distance of two or three feet from the  ceiling. The other spiders arrive on the scene, but not finding the  cause of the disturbance retire to their own webs again. When the  coast is thus clear, our spider proceeds to draw up the captive fly,  now exhausted by its struggles.[30]       [30] W. H. Hudson, _Naturalist in La Plata_, 1892, p. 189.    _War and brigandage._--When Man attacks animals of another species,  either to kill them and feed on their flesh, or to steal the  provisions which they have amassed for themselves or their young, this  is called \"hunting,\" and is considered as perfectly legitimate. When  men turn to beings of their own species either to kill them or to rob  them, several different cases are distinguished. If the assailants are  few in number, it is called \"brigandage,\" and is altogether  reprehensible; but if both assailant and assailed are considerable in  number, the action is called \"war,\" and receives no reprobation.    There are hunters among animals as well as among ourselves, and we  have seen their various methods of procedure; but there are also  brigands and warriors, and our superiority even in this department is  not so absolute as might be imagined.    Independently of ordinary brigandage, which is a brutal and simple  form of the struggle for life, manifested every time the animals find  themselves before a single repast, there are interesting facts to be  noted concerning robbers who act in a manner that Man himself would  not disavow. It is worthy of remark that it is the most sociable  animals who furnish us with the most characteristic examples.    Bees have a just renown as honest and laborious insects; there are,  however, some who depart from the right road, and they do not do it by  halves.[31] Among Hymenoptera the lazy profess the theory that pollen  belongs to all bees, and that stored-up honey does not constitute  private property. Therefore, to protest against work and economy, sly  methods are employed by a few to utilise as their own private property  the resources which Nature has made for all; they adopt the plan of  plundering the working insects, and carrying away for themselves the  pollen which the others had had the audacity to seek among the  flowers.       [31] L. Buechner, _Aus d. Geistesleben d. Thiere_, Berlin, 1879.    To arrive at these ends these clever Hymenoptera employ cunning, and  endeavour to pose as workers. They place themselves at the approaches  to a hive, and when a worker arrives laden with its burden they  advance towards it, caress it with their antennae, take possession of  its pollen as if to relieve it of a burden, and then fly away to their  own hive.    Others adopt less diplomatic proceedings. Some unite to intrude in a  badly-guarded hive, and gorge themselves with the honey to which they  have no right. Following up this success, they bring accomplices; a  veritable band of brigands is organised, who have no other industry  than to seize honey already manufactured in order to fill their own  cells. Their audacious enterprises are not always crowned with  success; they are repulsed in populous and well-organised hives, but  they are successful in the weaker ones. Sometimes they act with  violence, and to reduce a swarm they first fall on the queen and kill  her with their stings. Disconcerted by her death, the bees allow the  pillage of their dwelling, and the cells are robbed from top to  bottom. In some cases the deprived proprietors, in their turn carried  away by this insanity of rapine, even go over themselves to the  assailing party, and carry their own honey to the house of the  bandits. Henceforth they unite their fortune to that of the others,  and share in their easy and adventurous life.[32]       [32] P. Huber, _Recherches sur les Moeurs des Fourmis          indigenes_, Paris and Geneve, 1810, chap. ix.    Bates has given a vivid description of the armies of the South  American Foraging Ants (_Eciton_). They are carnivorous hunters who  march in large armies, and are found on the banks of the Amazon,  especially in the open campos of Santarem. The _Eciton legionis_  chiefly carry off the mangled larvae and pupae of other ants. They will  attack the nests of a bulky species of the genus _Formica_; they lift  out the bodies of these ants and tear them in pieces, as they are too  large for a single _Eciton_ to carry off, a number of carriers seizing  each fragment. They seem to divide into parties, one party excavating  and the other carrying away the grains of earth to a distance from the  hole just sufficient to prevent them rolling back into it. There is,  however, no rigid distribution of labour, the miners sometimes  becoming carriers, and then again assuming the office of carrying off  the prey. In marching off they form a broad and compact column, sixty  or seventy yards in length, those who may be empty-handed assisting  heavily-laden comrades. The _Eciton drepanophora_ attacks and carries  off all kinds of insects, especially wingless species, such as  maggots, caterpillars, larvae of cockroaches, etc. An eyeless  species,[33] the _Eciton erratica_, rapidly forms covered passages  under which to advance, and shows great skill in fitting the keystone  to these convex arcades.[34]       [33] Belt points out that blindness is an advantage in the          particular mode of hunting adopted by these ants, enabling          them to keep together. Those species of _Eciton_ which hunt          singly have very well developed eyes.       [34] Bates, _Naturalist on the Amazons_ (edition of 1892),          pp. 355-363.    Belt has also made some extremely interesting observations on the  _Ecitons_, whom for intelligence he places first among the ants of  Central America, and as such at the head of the Articulata.[35]       [35] See _Naturalist in Nicaragua_, 1888, pp. 17-29.    _Expeditions to acquire slaves._--In order to reduce one's own species  to slavery, it seems at first that an intelligence is required as  developed as that of Man. It is necessary in fact to attack beings  nearly equally well endowed from an intellectual and physical point of  view. The enterprise evidently presents every possible difficulty; but  in case of success, the result more than compensates for the effort.  The master in future need not trouble to work, for he possesses a tool  capable of doing everything as well as himself, since by means of  language he can easily impress his will on the acts of the other; a  domestic animal is only an auxiliary, the slave entirely replaces his  owner in every labour.    Several species of ants thus obtain slaves. The best known of these is  the _Polyergus rufescens_. We shall see in another chapter in what way  they"]]]
