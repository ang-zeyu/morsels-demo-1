The shoe is to be sewn up into its shape, and the stocking closed up.          A Carriage Boot.      Two colours,--say blue and claret,--four, or six-thread fleecy,--Needles  No. 6.    Cast seventeen stitches on each of three needles, with claret; pearl six  rounds, knit five rounds.--Then,--    With blue,--knit one round, pearl one round, alternately, for six  rounds.    With claret,--repeat the last six rounds.    Repeat the two last stripes, twice. Then,--    From the first needle,--knit fourteen stitches, with claret; join on the  blue; knit twenty-three, leaving fourteen stitches (claret),  corresponding with the other side, on the third needle; then, turn back  and knit five rows, slipping the first stitch at the commencement of  each row.    Repeat the last stripe, three times; first--with claret, second--with  blue, third--with claret.    In the next three stripes of the alternate colours, knit two together at  the commencement, and end, of every third row. Then,--knit one stripe  (claret), knitting two together at the commencement of each row. Cast  off.--This finishes the front of the boot.    Commence again at the fourteen claret stitches that were left on the  first needle,--knit these, and cast on another thirty-six stitches in  claret; knit six plain rows.--In the next row, knit two together, at the  commencement.

Plain knitting, but slipping the first stitch of every row.          Hints on Knitting.      A plain stitch at the beginning of each row, commonly called an _edge  stitch_, is a great improvement in most instances, as it makes an  uniform edge, and the pattern is kept more even at its commencement. In  most knitting, the edge-stitch is slipped.    It is easiest to learn to knit, by holding the wool over the fingers of  the left hand; the position of the hands is more graceful when thus  held.    It is always advisable to cast off loosely.    When it is requisite to cast off, and continue the row on a separate  needle, it is sometimes better to run a coarse silk through the cast off  stitches; they are easily taken up, when required, and the inconvenience  of the idle needle is avoided.    In knitting, when a pattern is spoken of, it means as many rows as form  the pattern.

For then the Light  N_p_ which in the fourth Prism is more refracted, will become fuller and  stronger when the Light OP, which in the third Prism HJK is more  refracted, vanishes at P; and afterwards when the less refracted Light  OT vanishes at T, the less refracted Light N_t_ will become increased  whilst the more refracted Light at _p_ receives no farther increase. And  as the trajected beam MO in vanishing is always of such a Colour as  ought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the  Paper PT, so is the reflected beam MN always of such a Colour as ought  to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper  _pt_. For when the most refrangible Rays are by a total Reflexion taken  out of the beam MO, and leave that beam of an orange Colour, the Excess  of those Rays in the reflected Light, does not only make the violet,  indigo and blue at _p_ more full, but also makes the beam MN change from  the yellowish Colour of the Sun's Light, to a pale white inclining to  blue, and afterward recover its yellowish Colour again, so soon as all  the rest of the transmitted Light MOT is reflected.    Now seeing that in all this variety of Experiments, whether the Trial be  made in Light reflected, and that either from natural Bodies, as in the  first and second Experiment, or specular, as in the ninth; or in Light  refracted, and that either before the unequally refracted Rays are by  diverging separated from one another, and losing their whiteness which  they have altogether, appear severally of several Colours, as in the  fifth Experiment; or after they are separated from one another, and  appear colour'd as in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Experiments; or in  Light trajected through parallel Superficies, destroying each others  Effects, as in the tenth Experiment; there are always found Rays, which  at equal Incidences on the same Medium suffer unequal Refractions, and  that without any splitting or dilating of single Rays, or contingence in  the inequality of the Refractions, as is proved in the fifth and sixth  Experiments. And seeing the Rays which differ in Refrangibility may be  parted and sorted from one another, and that either by Refraction as in  the third Experiment, or by Reflexion as in the tenth, and then the  several sorts apart at equal Incidences suffer unequal Refractions, and  those sorts are more refracted than others after Separation, which were  more refracted before it, as in the sixth and following Experiments, and  if the Sun's Light be trajected through three or more cross Prisms  successively, those Rays which in the first Prism are refracted more  than others, are in all the following Prisms refracted more than others  in the same Rate and Proportion, as appears by the fifth Experiment;  it's manifest that the Sun's Light is an heterogeneous Mixture of Rays,  some of which are constantly more refrangible than others, as was  proposed.      _PROP._ III. THEOR. III.    _The Sun's Light consists of Rays differing in Reflexibility, and those  Rays are more reflexible than others which are more refrangible._    This is manifest by the ninth and tenth Experiments: For in the ninth  Experiment, by turning the Prism about its Axis, until the Rays within  it which in going out into the Air were refracted by its Base, became so  oblique to that Base, as to begin to be totally reflected thereby; those  Rays became first of all totally reflected, which before at equal  Incidences with the rest had suffered the greatest Refraction. And the  same thing happens in the Reflexion made by the common Base of the two  Prisms in the tenth Experiment.      _PROP._ IV. PROB. I.    _To separate from one another the heterogeneous Rays of compound Light._    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]    The heterogeneous Rays are in some measure separated from one another by  the Refraction of the Prism in the third Experiment, and in the fifth  Experiment, by taking away the Penumbra from the rectilinear sides of  the coloured Image, that Separation in those very rectilinear sides or  straight edges of the Image becomes perfect. But in all places between  those rectilinear edges, those innumerable Circles there described,  which are severally illuminated by homogeneal Rays, by interfering with  one another, and being every where commix'd, do render the Light  sufficiently compound. But if these Circles, whilst their Centers keep  their Distances and Positions, could be made less in Diameter, their  interfering one with another, and by Consequence the Mixture of the  heterogeneous Rays would be proportionally diminish'd. In the twenty  third Figure let AG, BH, CJ, DK, EL, FM be the Circles which so many  sorts of Rays flowing from the same disque of the Sun, do in the third  Experiment illuminate; of all which and innumerable other intermediate  ones lying in a continual Series between the two rectilinear and  parallel edges of the Sun's oblong Image PT, that Image is compos'd, as  was explained in the fifth Experiment. And let _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, _dk_,  _el_, _fm_ be so many less Circles lying in a like continual Series  between two parallel right Lines _af_ and _gm_ with the same distances  between their Centers, and illuminated by the same sorts of Rays, that  is the Circle _ag_ with the same sort by which the corresponding Circle  AG was illuminated, and the Circle _bh_ with the same sort by which the  corresponding Circle BH was illuminated, and the rest of the Circles  _ci_, _dk_, _el_, _fm_ respectively, with the same sorts of Rays by  which the several corresponding Circles CJ, DK, EL, FM were illuminated.  In the Figure PT composed of the greater Circles, three of those Circles  AG, BH, CJ, are so expanded into one another, that the three sorts of  Rays by which those Circles are illuminated, together with other  innumerable sorts of intermediate Rays, are mixed at QR in the middle  of the Circle BH. And the like Mixture happens throughout almost the  whole length of the Figure PT. But in the Figure _pt_ composed of the  less Circles, the three less Circles _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, which answer to  those three greater, do not extend into one another; nor are there any  where mingled so much as any two of the three sorts of Rays by which  those Circles are illuminated, and which in the Figure PT are all of  them intermingled at BH.    Now he that shall thus consider it, will easily understand that the  Mixture is diminished in the same Proportion with the Diameters of the  Circles. If the Diameters of the Circles whilst their Centers remain the  same, be made three times less than before, the Mixture will be also  three times less; if ten times less, the Mixture will be ten times less,  and so of other Proportions. That is, the Mixture of the Rays in the  greater Figure PT will be to their Mixture in the less _pt_, as the  Latitude of the greater Figure is to the Latitude of the less. For the  Latitudes of these Figures are equal to the Diameters of their Circles.  And hence it easily follows, that the Mixture of the Rays in the  refracted Spectrum _pt_ is to the Mixture of the Rays in the direct and  immediate Light of the Sun, as the breadth of that Spectrum is to the  difference between the length and breadth of the same Spectrum.    So then, if we would diminish the Mixture of the Rays, we are to  diminish the Diameters of the Circles. Now these would be diminished if  the Sun's Diameter to which they answer could be made less than it is,  or (which comes to the same Purpose) if without Doors, at a great  distance from the Prism towards the Sun, some opake Body were placed,  with a round hole in the middle of it, to intercept all the Sun's Light,  excepting so much as coming from the middle of his Body could pass  through that Hole to the Prism. For so the Circles AG, BH, and the rest,  would not any longer answer to the whole Disque of the Sun, but only to  that Part of it which could be seen from the Prism through that Hole,  that it is to the apparent Magnitude of that Hole view'd from the Prism.  But that these Circles may answer more distinctly to that Hole, a Lens  is to be placed by the Prism to cast the Image of the Hole, (that is,  every one of the Circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the Paper at PT,  after such a manner, as by a Lens placed at a Window, the Species of  Objects abroad are cast distinctly upon a Paper within the Room, and the  rectilinear Sides of the oblong Solar Image in the fifth Experiment  became distinct without any Penumbra. If this be done, it will not be  necessary to place that Hole very far off, no not beyond the Window. And  therefore instead of that Hole, I used the Hole in the Window-shut, as  follows.    _Exper._ 11. In the Sun's Light let into my darken'd Chamber through a  small round Hole in my Window-shut, at about ten or twelve Feet from the  Window, I placed a Lens, by which the Image of the Hole might be  distinctly cast upon a Sheet of white Paper, placed at the distance of  six, eight, ten, or twelve Feet from the Lens. For, according to the  difference of the Lenses I used various distances, which I think not  worth the while to describe. Then immediately after the Lens I placed a  Prism, by which the trajected Light might be refracted either upwards or  sideways, and thereby the round Image, which the Lens alone did cast  upon the Paper might be drawn out into a long one with Parallel Sides,  as in the third Experiment. This oblong Image I let fall upon another  Paper at about the same distance from the Prism as before, moving the  Paper either towards the Prism or from it, until I found the just  distance where the Rectilinear Sides of the Image became most distinct.  For in this Case, the Circular Images of the Hole, which compose that  Image after the same manner that the Circles _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. do  the Figure _pt_ [i"]]]
