Waldman, a  fellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that  he omitted.    I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said that I had long  considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I  returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any  shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a  repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in  favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a  strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come  to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content  with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth,  and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of  knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of  recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists. Besides, I had  a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very  different, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power;  such views, although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed.  The ambition of the enquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation  of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I  was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of  little worth.    Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my  residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted  with the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode. But as  the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe  had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent  to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a  pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never  seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.    Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the  lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor  was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but  with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs  covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly  black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the  sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of  the history of chemistry, and the various improvements made by different  men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most  distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present  state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After  having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric  upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:--    \"The ancient teachers of this science,\" said he, \"promised  impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very  little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir  of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made  to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or  crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the  recesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places. They  ascend into the heavens: they have discovered how the blood circulates,  and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost  unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the  earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.\"    Such were the professor's words--rather let me say such the words of  fate, enounced to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were  grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were  touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was  sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,  one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of  Frankenstein,--more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps  already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and  unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.    I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of  insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I  had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning's dawn, sleep  came. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream. There  only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to  devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a  natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners  in private were even more mild and attractive than in public; for there  was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own  house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him  pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to  his fellow-professor. He heard with attention the little narration  concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and  Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He  said, that \"these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern  philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their  knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names,  and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a  great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours  of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in  ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.\" I listened to his  statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation;  and then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against  modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty  and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape  (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm  which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning  the books I ought to procure.    \"I am happy,\" said M. Waldman, \"to have gained a disciple; and if your  application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.  Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest  improvements have been and may be made: it is on that account that I  have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not  neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very  sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge  alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely  a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch  of natural philosophy, including mathematics.\"    He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his  various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and  promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough  in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list  of books which I had requested; and I took my leave.    Thus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my future destiny.          CHAPTER IV.      From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the  most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.  I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,  which modern enquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the  lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the  university; and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense  and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy  and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I  found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and  his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature,  that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for  me the path of knowledge, and made the most abstruse enquiries clear and  facile to my apprehension. My application was at first fluctuating and  uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded, and soon became so ardent  and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning  whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.    As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was  rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my  proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with  a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed  the most heart-felt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this  manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart  and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements  of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before  you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit  there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate  capacity, which closely pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at  great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the  attainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this,  improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some  discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which  procured me great esteem and admiration at the university."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4248"],[0,"The Problem of the Ohio Mounds (#9)"],[1," first place it shows that a powerful and active tribe in  the interior of the country, in contact with the tribes of the  North on one side and with those of the South on the other, were  mound-builders. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that they  had derived this custom from their neighbors on one side or the  other, or that they had, to some extent at least, introduced it  among them. Beyond question it indicates that the mound-building  era had not closed previous to the discovery of the continent by  Europeans. [Footnote: Since the above was in type one of the  assistants of the Ethnological Bureau discovered in a small mound  in east Tennessee a stone with letters of the Cherokee alphabet  rudely carved upon it. It was not an intensive burial, hence it is  evident that the mound must have been built since 1820, or that  Guess was not the author of the Cherokee alphabet.]            CHAPTER V.    THE CHEROKEES AND THE TALLEGWI.      The ancient works of Ohio, with their \"altar mounds,\" \"sacred  enclosures,\" and \"mathematically accurate\" but mysterious circles  and squares, are still pointed to as impregnable to the attacks of  this Indian theory. That the rays of light falling upon their  origin are few and dim, is admitted; still, we are not left wholly  in the dark.    If the proof be satisfactory that the mounds of the southern half  of the United States and a portion of those of the Upper  Mississippi Valley are of Indian origin, there should be very  strong evidence in the opposite direction in regard to those of  Ohio to lead to the belief that they are of a different race. Even  should the evidence fail to indicate the tribe or tribes by whom  they were built, this will not justify the assertion that they are  not of Indian origin.    If the evidence relating to these works has nothing decidedly  opposed to the theory in it, then the presumption must be in favor  of the view that the authors were Indians, for the reasons  heretofore given. The burden of proof is on those who deny this,  and not on those who assert it.    It is legitimate, therefore, to assume, until evidence to the  contrary is produced, that the Ohio works were made by Indians.    The geographical position of the defensive works connected with  these remains indicates, as has been often remarked by writers on  this subject, a pressure from northern hordes which finally  resulted in driving the inhabitants of the fertile valleys of the  Miami, Scioto, and Muskingum, southward, possibly into the Gulf  States, where they became incorporated with the tribes of that  section. [Footnote: Force: \"To what race did the mound-builders  belong?\" p. 74, etc.] If this is assumed as correct it only tends  to confirm the theory of an Indian origin.    But the decision is not left to mere assumption and the  indications mentioned, as there are other and more direct  evidences bearing upon this point to be found in the works of art  and modes of burial in this region. That the mound-builders of  Ohio made and used the pipe is proven by the large number of pipes  found in the mounds, and that they cultivated tobacco may  reasonably be inferred from this fact.    The general use of the pipe among the mound-builders is another  evidence of their relation to the Indians; while, on the other  hand, this fact and the forms of the pipes indicate that they were  not connected with the Nahua, Maya, or Pueblo tribes.    Although varied indefinitely by the addition of animal and other  figures, the typical or simple form of the pipe of the Ohio mound-  builders appears to have been that represented by Squier and Davis  [Footnote: Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, 1847, p.  179.] in their Fig. 68; and by Rau in Smithsonian Contributions to  Knowledge, No. 287. [Footnote: 1876, p. 47, Fig. 177.] The  peculiar feature is the broad, flat, and slightly-curved base or  stem, which projects beyond the bowl to an extent usually equal to  the perforated end. Reference has already been made to the  statement by Adair that the Cherokees were accustomed to carve,  from the soft stone found in the country, \"pipes, full a span  long, with the fore part commonly running out with a short peak  two or three fingers broad and a quarter of an inch thick.\" But he  adds further, as if intending to describe the typical form of the  Ohio pipe, \"on both sides of the bowl lengthwise.\" This addition  is important, as it has been asserted [Footnote: Young  Mineralogist and Antiquarian, 1885, No. 10. p. 79.] that no  mention can be found of the manufacture or use of pipes of this  form by the Indians, or that they had any knowledge of this form.    E. A. Barber says: [Footnote: Am. Nat., vol. 16, 1882, pp. 265,  266]    The earliest stone pipes from the mounds were always carved from a  single piece, and consist of a flat curved base, of variable  length and width, with the bowl rising from the center of the  convex side (Anc. Mon., p. 227).    The typical mound pipe is the Monitor form, as it may be termed,  possessing a short, cylindrical urn, or spool-shaped bowl, rising  from the center of a flat and slightly-curved base. [Footnote: For  examples of this form see Rau: Smithsonian Contributions to  Knowledge, No. 287, p. 47, Fig. 177.]    Accepting this statement as proof that the \"Monitor\" pipe is  generally understood to be the oldest type of the mound-builders'  pipe, it is easy to trace the modifications which brought into use  the simple form of the modern Indian pipe. For example, there is  one of the form shown in Fig. 5, from Hamilton County, Ohio;  another from a large mound in Kanawha Valley, West Virginia;  [Footnote: Science. 1884, vol. 3, p. 619.] several taken from  Indian graves in Essex County, Mass.; [Footnote: Abbott, Prim.  Industry, 1881, Fig. 313, p. 319; Bull. Essex Inst., vol. 3, 1872,  p. 123.] another found in the grave of a Seneca Indian in the  valley of the Genesee; [Footnote: Morgan, League of the Iroquois,  p. 356.] and others found by the representatives of the Bureau of  Ethnology in the mounds of western North Carolina.    [Illustration with caption: FIG. 5. Pipe from Hamilton County,  Ohio.]    So far, the modification consists in simply shortening the forward  projection of the stem or base, the bowl remaining perpendicular.  The next modification is shown in Fig. 6, which represents a type  less common than the preceding, but found in several localites,  as, for example, in Hamilton County, Ohio; mounds in Sullivan  County, east Tennessee (by the Bureau); and in Virginia.  [Footnote: Rau: Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, No. 287,  p. 50, Fig. 190.] In these, although retaining the broad or winged  stem, we see the bowl assuming the forward slope and in some  instances (as some of those found in the mounds in Sullivan  County, Tenn.) the projection of the stem is reduced to a simple  rim or is entirely wanting.    [Illustration with caption: FIG. 6. Pipe from Hamilton County,  Ohio.]    [Illustration with caption: FIG. 7. Pipe from Sullivan County,  Tennessee.]    The next step brings us to what may be considered the typical form  of the modern pipe, shown in Fig. 8. This pattern, according to  Dr. Abbott, [Footnote: Prim. Industry, 1861, p. 329.] is seldom  found in New England or the Middle States, \"except of a much  smaller size and made of clay.\" He figures one from Isle of Wight  County, Va., \"made of compact steatite.\" A large number of this  form were found in the North Carolina mounds, some with stems  almost or quite a foot in length.    [Illustration with caption: FIG. 8. Pipe from Caldwell County,  North Carolina.]    It is hardly necessary to add that among the specimens obtained  from various localities can be found every possible gradation,  from the ancient Ohio type to the modern form last mentioned.  There is, therefore, in this peculiar line of art and custom an  unbroken chain connecting the mound-builders of Ohio with the  Indians of historic times, and in the same facts is evidence,  which strengthens the argument, disconnecting the makers from the  Mexican and Central American artisans.    As this evidence appears to point to the Cherokees as the authors  of some of the typical mounds of Ohio, it may be as well to  introduce here a summary of the data which bear upon this  question.    Reasons which are thought well-nigh conclusive have already been  presented for believing that the people of this tribe were mound-  builders, and that they had migrated in pre-Columbian times from  some point north of the locality in which they were encountered by  Europeans. Taking up the thread of their history where it was  dropped, the following reasons are offered as a basis for the  conclusion that their home was for a time on the Ohio, and that  this was the region from which they migrated to their historic  locality.    As already shown, their general movement in historic times, though  limited, has been southward. Their traditions also claim that  their migrations previous to the advent of the whites had been in  the same direction from some point northward, not indicated in  that given by Lederer, but in that recorded by Haywood, from the  valley of the Ohio. But it is proper to bear in mind that the  tradition given by Lederer expressly distinguishes them from the  Virginia tribes, which necessitates looking more to the west for  their former home. Haywood connects them, without any authority,  with the Virginia tribes, but the tradition he gives contradicts  this and places them on the Ohio.    The chief hostile pressure against them of which we have any  knowledge was from the Iroquois of the north. This testimony is  further strengthened by the linguistic evidence, as it has been  ascertained that the language of this tribe belongs to the  Iroquoian stock.
