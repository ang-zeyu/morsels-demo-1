He dropped his right hand significantly to  his hip.    \"Don't throw your gun. It might go off,\" said Dale.    Whatever Riggs's intention had been--and it was probably just what Dale  evidently had read it--he now flushed an angry red and jerked at his  gun.    Dale's hand flashed too swiftly for Helen's eye to follow it. But she  heard the thud as it struck. The gun went flying to the platform and  scattered a group of Indians and Mexicans.    \"You'll hurt yourself some day,\" said Dale.    Helen had never heard a slow, cool voice like this hunter's. Without  excitement or emotion or hurry, it yet seemed full and significant of  things the words did not mean. Bo uttered a strange little exultant cry.    Riggs's arm had dropped limp. No doubt it was numb. He stared, and his  predominating expression was surprise. As the shuffling crowd began to  snicker and whisper, Riggs gave Dale a malignant glance, shifted it to  Helen, and then lurched away in the direction of his gun.    Dale did not pay any more attention to him. Gathering up Helen's  baggage, he said, \"Come on,\" and shouldered a lane through the gaping  crowd. The girls followed close at his heels.    \"Nell! what 'd I tell you?\" whispered Bo. \"Oh, you're all atremble!\"    Helen was aware of her unsteadiness; anger and fear and relief in quick  succession had left her rather weak. Once through the motley crowd  of loungers, she saw an old gray stage-coach and four lean horses. A  grizzled, sunburned man sat on the driver's seat, whip and reins in  hand. Beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees. Another  man, young, tall, lean, dark, stood holding the coach door open. He  touched his sombrero to the girls. His eyes were sharp as he addressed  Dale.    \"Milt, wasn't you held up?\"    \"No. But some long-haired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls.  Wanted to throw his gun on me. I was sure scared,\" replied Dale, as he  deposited the luggage.    Bo laughed. Her eyes, resting upon Dale, were warm and bright. The  young man at the coach door took a second look at her, and then a smile  changed the dark hardness of his face.    Dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage, and then, placing  the lighter luggage, in with them, he threw the heavier pieces on top.    \"Joe, climb up,\" he said.    \"Wal, Milt,\" drawled the driver, \"let's ooze along.\"    Dale hesitated, with his hand on the door. He glanced at the crowd, now  edging close again, and then at Helen.    \"I reckon I ought to tell you,\" he said, and indecision appeared to  concern him.    \"What?\" exclaimed Helen.    \"Bad news. But talkin' takes time. An' we mustn't lose any.\"    \"There's need of hurry?\" queried Helen, sitting up sharply.    \"I reckon.\"    \"Is this the stage to Snowdrop?    \"No. That leaves in the mornin'. We rustled this old trap to get a start  to-night.\"    \"The sooner the better. But I--I don't understand,\" said Helen,  bewildered.    \"It'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage,\" returned Dale.    \"Safe! Oh, what do you mean?\" exclaimed Helen. Apprehensively she gazed  at him and then back at Bo.    \"Explainin' will take time. An' facts may change your mind. But if you  can't trust me--\"    \"Trust you!\" interposed Helen, blankly. \"You mean to take us to  Snowdrop?\"    \"I reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit Snowdrop,\" he replied,  shortly.    \"Then to Pine--to my uncle--Al Auchincloss?    \"Yes, I'm goin' to try hard.\"    Helen caught her breath. She divined that some peril menaced her. She  looked steadily, with all a woman's keenness, into this man's face. The  moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store  for her. Her future and that of Bo's were now to be dependent upon her  judgments. It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she  welcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of  buckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone  of his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she  saw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was  clear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean-cut,  strong-jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.    \"Yes, I'll trust you,\" she said. \"Get in, and let us hurry. Then you can  explain.\"    \"All ready, Bill. Send 'em along,\" called Dale.    He had to stoop to enter the stage, and, once in, he appeared to fill  that side upon which he sat. Then the driver cracked his whip; the  stage lurched and began to roll; the motley crowd was left behind. Helen  awakened to the reality, as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the  hunter, that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began  with the rattling roll of that old stage-coach.    Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between  his knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was  bareheaded. Helen had never seen a face like that, which at first glance  appeared darkly bronzed and hard, and then became clear, cold, aloof,  still, intense. She wished she might see a smile upon it. And now that  the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was  singular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One  instant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and  again that it was neither.    \"I'm glad you've got your sister,\" he said, presently.    \"How did you know she's my sister?\"    \"I reckon she looks like you.\"    \"No one else ever thought so,\" replied Helen, trying to smile.    Bo had no difficulty in smiling, as she said, \"Wish I was half as pretty  as Nell.\"    \"Nell. Isn't your name Helen?\" queried Dale.    \"Yes. But my--some few call me Nell.\"    \"I like Nell better than Helen. An' what's yours?\" went on Dale, looking  at Bo.    \"Mine's Bo. Just plain B-o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they  gave it to me,\" she replied.    \"Bo. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many  people for years.\"    \"Oh! we've left the town!\" cried Bo. \"Look, Nell! How bare! It's just  like desert.\"    \"It is desert. We've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a  tree.\"    Helen glanced out. A flat, dull-green expanse waved away from the road  on and on to a bright, dark horizon-line, where the sun was setting  rayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a  cold thrill.    \"Did your uncle Al ever write anythin' about a man named Beasley?\" asked  Dale.    \"Indeed he did,\" replied Helen, with a start of surprise. \"Beasley! That  name is familiar to us--and detestable. My uncle complained of this man  for years. Then he grew bitter--accused Beasley. But the last year or so  not a word!\"    \"Well, now,\" began the hunter, earnestly, \"let's get the bad news over.  I'm sorry you must be worried. But you must learn to take the West as it  is. There's good an' bad, maybe more bad. That's because the country's  young.... So to come right out with it--this Beasley hired a gang of  outlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to Snowdrop--to-morrow--an'  to make off with you.\"    \"Make off with me?\" ejaculated Helen, bewildered.    \"Kidnap you! Which, in that gang, would be worse than killing you!\"  declared Dale, grimly, and he closed a huge fist on his knee.    Helen was utterly astounded.    \"How hor-rible!\" she gasped out. \"Make off with me!... What in Heaven's  name for?\"    Bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance.    \"For reasons you ought to guess,\" replied Dale, and he leaned forward  again. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there  was a something about him that fascinated Helen. \"I'm a hunter. I live  in the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm  an' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.  I hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They  couldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson  an' his gang of sheep-thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.  Pretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his  last legs--how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.  Beasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get  you out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With  Al dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he  wouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late.... Well,  they rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're  all my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I  didn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'  for that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides  Beasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me  because he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.  Then we fell out--or he fell out--because he believed a tame lion of  mine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have  done it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but  old Al wouldn't listen. He's cross--very cross. An' when I tried to tell  him, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I  reckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four  friends I could trust. They're Mormon boys--brothers. That's Joe out  on top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked  them to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.  It happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.  An' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends  here--Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage....  An' here you are.\" Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at  Helen and then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34571"],[0,"The Pearl Story Book: Stories and Legends of Winter, Christmas, and New Year's (#9)"],[1," take their places--and I am  the only tree in this large garden that is always fresh and bright. As  for you, dear Willow, your branches all hang down, you have no leaves  now and, as you are neither strong nor pretty and shake in such a  little wind, of what good are you to yourself, or to any one else?\"    \"Dear Pine,\" the Willow answered, \"I do not tremble with fear, for I  am not afraid, but God made me so that the wind would move my branches  very easily, and that I should not have leaves in the winter time. By  and by I shall have delicate green leaves and blossoms, and I thank  Him for giving me a beautiful summer dress, even though I go bare in  cold weather. It must be very beautiful to be strong and handsome, as  you are, and I am happy in having so good a friend.\"    While they were talking the wind had grown much stronger, and now the  rain came pouring down. The Pine stood up angrily against the wind,  scolding with a hin, hin, hin, while the Willow bent and swayed to  and fro and all the other trees bowed their heads.    Then the Pine said, \"Willow, why do you not push this rude wind away  instead of yielding to him; you are cowardly to let him abuse you so,  when you might resist him, as I do.\"    Then the Willow answered, \"There are many ways to keep oneself from  harm, and I do not like to resist any one with force.\"    The Pine was vexed at the Willow and would say no more, but battled  with the wind he could no longer hold back. Then his branches were  torn and his top broken off; they fell to the ground and the proud  tree was a sad sight.    But the Willow bent her branches and yielded to the wind, and so was  unhurt.    The next morning, when the rain had ceased and the sun shone brightly,  the owner of the garden came out to see how his trees had stood the  storm. When he saw the broken Pine he thought it was too bad to have a  broken tree in his fine garden, so he ordered the gardener to move the  Pine into the back yard.    After a time, spring came, and the Willow put forth her lovely green  leaves and every one who passed looked at the graceful tree and said,  \"How beautiful she is, how gentle she seems!\"    The little birds built their nests in her branches, and soon baby  birds came, which made the tree very happy. The butterflies danced  around in the sunshine and all summer little children loved to play in  the shade of the drooping Willow.    And when the Pine peeped in from the back yard, and saw how happy and  beautiful the Willow was, and how the children, the birds, and the  butterflies loved to play about her, he thought, \"If only I had been  less proud of my own strength, then might I, too, be standing in that  beautiful garden with my crown of leaves, and with young life all  about me.\"          WHY THE WILD RABBITS ARE WHITE IN WINTER    (Algonquin Legend)    Adapted from \"Algonquin Indian Tales,\" by Egerton R. Young. Copyright,  1903, by Egerton R. Young. Reprinted by permission of the Abington  Press, Publishers.      Long ago Wild Rabbit of the Northland wore a brown fur coat,  throughout the year. Today, when the long winter months come, Wild  Rabbit changes his coat of brown to one that is the colour of the  snow. And this is how the change happened.    Wild Rabbit could not defend himself from his many foes. Almost all  the animals,--foxes of all kinds, wildcats, wolves, wolverines,  weasels, and ermine hunted Wild Rabbit for food. Then there were the  fierce birds,--the eagles, hawks, and owls--that were always on the  lookout for rabbits, young or old. The result was that with this war  continually waged against them, the poor rabbits had a hard time of  it, especially in winter. They found it very difficult to hide  themselves when the leaves were off the trees and the ground was  covered with snow.    In those days of long ago the animals used to have a large council.  There was a great father at the head of each kind of animal and bird,  and these leaders used to meet and talk about the welfare of their  kind. There was always peace and friendship among them while at the  council. They appointed a king and he presided as chief. All the  animals that had troubles or grievances had a right to come and speak  about them at the council, and if it were possible, all wrongs were  remedied.    Sometimes queer things were said. At one council the bear found great  fault with the fox who had deceived him and had caused him to lose his  beautiful tail by telling him to go and catch fish with it in a big  crack in the ice. The bear sat fishing so long that the crack froze up  solidly and, to save his life, the bear had to break off his tail.    But all the things they talked about were not so funny as the bear's  complaint. They had their troubles and dangers and they discussed  various plans for improving their condition; also, they considered how  they could best defeat the skill and cleverness of the human hunters.    At one of the council meetings, when the rabbit's turn to be heard  came, he said that his people were nearly all destroyed, that the rest  of the world seemed to be combined against his race and they were  killing them by day and night, in summer and winter. Also, he declared  that the rabbits had little power to fight against enemies, and,  therefore, his people were almost discouraged, but they had sent him  to the council to see if the members could suggest any remedy or plan  to save the rabbit race from complete destruction.    While the rabbit was speaking the wolverine winked at the wildcat,  while the fox, although he tried to look solemn, could not keep his  mouth from watering as he thought of the many rabbits he intended to  eat.    Thus it can be seen that the rabbit did not get much sympathy from his  enemies in the council. But his friends,--the moose, the reindeer,  and the mountain goat--stood up in the meeting and spoke out bravely  for their little friend. Indeed, they told the animals that had  laughed at the little rabbit's sad story that if they continued to  kill all the rabbits they could find there would soon be none left.  Then these cruel animals would be the greatest sufferers, for what  else could they find to eat in sufficient numbers to keep them alive,  if the rabbits were all gone?    This thought sobered the thoughtless animals at first but they soon  resumed their mocking at the poor little rabbit and his story. As they  happened to be in the majority, the council refused to do anything in  the matter.    When the moose heard the decision of the council he was very sorry for  his poor little brother rabbit. He lowered his head and told the  rabbit to jump on one of his flat horns. The moose then carried him  some distance away from the council and said, \"There is no hope for  you here. Most of the animals live on you and so they will not do  anything that will make it more difficult for you to be caught than  it now is. Your only hope is to go to Manabozho, and see what he can  do for you. His name was once Manabush, which means Great Rabbit, so I  am sure he will be your friend because I think he is a distant  relative of yours.\"    Away sped the rabbit along the route described by the moose, who had  lately found out where Manabozho was stopping.    The rabbit was such a timid creature that, when he came near to  Manabozho, he was much afraid that he would not be welcomed. However,  his case was desperate, and although his heart was thumping with fear  he hurried along to have the matter decided as soon as possible.    To his great joy he found Manabozho in the best humour and the little  creature was received most kindly. The great Master saw how weary the  little rabbit was after the long journey so he made the little fellow  rest on some fragrant grass in the sunshine. Then Manabozho went out  and brought in some of the choicest things in his garden for the  rabbit.    \"Tell me all your troubles, little brother,\" said Manabozho. \"Also,  tell me about the council meeting.\"    The rabbit repeated his story and told all about the treatment he had  received at the council.    When the Great Master heard how unjustly the little rabbit had been  treated he grew very angry and said, \"And that is the way they treated  little brother rabbit at the council we have given them, is it? And  they know we expect them to give the smallest and weakest the same  kind of justice as they offer the biggest and strongest! It is high  time for some one to report the council news to me if such unfair  meetings take place. Look out, Mr. Fox, Mr. Wolverine, and Mr.  Wildcat, for if I take you in hand you'll be sorry little brother  rabbit was obliged to come to Manabozho for help.\"    The Great Master had worked himself up into such a furious temper that  the rabbit was frightened almost to death. But when Manabozho saw this  he laughed and said, \"I'm sorry to have frightened you, little  brother. But I was so very angry with those animals for ill-treating  you that I forgot myself. And now tell me what you wish me to do for  you?\"    After a long talk about the matter it was decided that there should be  two great changes made. First, the eyes of the rabbit should be so  increased in power that in the future they would be able to see by  night as well as by day. Second, in all the Northland where much snow  falls during many months of the year the rabbits of that region should  change their coats for the winter season into a beautiful white colour  like the snow.    And the rabbits of the Northland now have a much better time than they  had formerly. In their soft white coats they can glide away from their  enemies, or they can sometimes escape notice by remaining perfectly  still on the white earth.
