THE UNREASONABLE CONDUCT OF A POPE.--\"Pope Sixtus V. expended in three  years (from 1586 to 1589) 5,339 scudi, (about $83,500) in destroying a  portion of the Baths of Diocletian; and 2,560,000 cubic feet of masonry  were broken up. These facts are recorded in a book of accounts found in  the Vatican library, at Rome.\"--_The Toujee Tourist, of April, 1880._            ETHAN ALLEN, THE INFIDEL, AND HIS DAUGHTER.          \"The damps of death are coming fast,        My father, o'er my brow;      The past, with all its scenes, are fled,        And I must turn me now      To that dim future which, in vain,        My feeble eyes descry.      Tell me, my father, in this hour,        In whose stern faith to die.        \"In thine? I've watched the scornful smile        And heard thy withering tone      Whene'er the Christian's humble hope        Was placed above thine own.      I've heard thee speak of coming death        Without a shade of gloom,      And laugh at all the childish fears        That cluster round the tomb.        \"Or, is it my mother's faith?

Philosophy has sometimes forgotten God, as great people never did. The  skepticism of the last century could not uproot Christianity because it  lived in the hearts of the millions. Do you think that infidelity is  spreading? Christianity never lived in the hearts of so many millions as  at this moment. Many forms under which it is professed may decay, for  they, like all that is the work of man's hands, are subject to the changes  and chances of mortal beings, but the spirit of truth is incorruptible; it  may be developed, illustrated and applied; it can never die; it never can  decline. No truth can perish. No truth can pass away. The flame is  undying, though generations disappear. Wherever immortal truth has started  into being, humanity claims and guards the bequest. Each generation  gathers together the imperishable children of the past and increases them  by the new sons of the light, alike radiant with immortality.--_Bancroft._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#9)"],[1,"Lep opened his mouth to speak, every one else  was peremptorily ordered to hold his tongue, so that Lep's words might  be written down. In fact it was something like an exaggerated edition of  Betsy Trotwood and Mr. Dick.    \"It must have been an odd dinner party\" (says Prof. Stuart), \"with this  strange, wild, terribly clever man, with his red hair and brazen nose,  sometimes flashing with wit and knowledge, sometimes making the whole  company, princes and servants alike, hold their peace and listen humbly  to the ravings of a poor imbecile.\"    To people he despised he did not show his serious instruments. He had  other attractions, in the shape of a lot of toy machinery, little  windmills, and queer doors, and golden globes, and all manner of  ingenious tricks and automata, many of which he had made himself, and  these he used to show them instead; and no doubt they were well enough  pleased with them. Those of the visitors, however, who really cared to  see and understand his instruments, went away enchanted with his genius  and hospitality.    I may, perhaps, be producing an unfair impression of imperiousness and  insolence. Tycho was fiery, no doubt, but I think we should wrong him  if we considered him insolent. Most of the nobles of his day were  haughty persons, accustomed to deal with serfs, and very likely to sneer  at and trample on any meek man of science whom they could easily  despise. So Tycho was not meek; he stood up for the honour of his  science, and paid them back in their own coin, with perhaps a little  interest. That this behaviour was not worldly-wise is true enough, but I  know of no commandment enjoining us to be worldly-wise.    If we knew more about his so-called imbecile _protege_ we should  probably find some reason for the interest which Tycho took in him.  Whether he was what is now called a \"clairvoyant\" or not, Tycho  evidently regarded his utterances as oracular, and of course when one is  receiving what may be a revelation from heaven it is natural to suppress  ordinary conversation.    Among the noble visitors whom he received and entertained, it is  interesting to notice James I. of England, who spent eight days at  Uraniburg on the occasion of his marriage with Anne of Denmark in 1590,  and seems to have been deeply impressed by his visit.    Among other gifts, James presented Tycho with a dog (depicted in Fig.  24), and this same animal was subsequently the cause of trouble. For it  seems that one day the Chancellor of Denmark, Walchendorf, brutally  kicked the poor beast; and Tycho, who was very fond of animals, gave him  a piece of his mind in no measured language. Walchendorf went home  determined to ruin him. King Frederick, however, remained his true  friend, doubtless partly influenced thereto by his Queen Sophia, an  enlightened woman who paid many visits to Uraniburg, and knew Tycho  well. But unfortunately Frederick died; and his son, a mere boy, came to  the throne.    Now was the time for the people whom Tycho had offended, for those who  were jealous of his great fame and importance, as well as for those who  cast longing eyes on his estate and endowments. The boy-king, too,  unfortunately paid a visit to Tycho, and, venturing upon a decided  opinion on some recondite subject, received a quiet setting down which  he ill relished.    Letters written by Tycho about this time are full of foreboding. He  greatly dreads having to leave Uraniburg, with which his whole life has  for twenty years been bound up. He tries to comfort himself with the  thought that, wherever he is sent, he will have the same heavens and the  same stars over his head.    Gradually his Norwegian estate and his pension were taken away, and in  five years poverty compelled him to abandon his magnificent temple, and  to take a small house in Copenhagen.    Not content with this, Walchendorf got a Royal Commission appointed to  inquire into the value of his astronomical labours. This sapient body  reported that his work was not only useless, but noxious; and soon after  he was attacked by the populace in the public street.    Nothing was left for him now but to leave the country, and he went into  Germany, leaving his wife and instruments to follow him whenever he  could find a home for them.    His wanderings in this dark time--some two years--are not quite clear;  but at last the enlightened Emperor of Bohemia, Rudolph II., invited him  to settle in Prague. Thither he repaired, a castle was given him as an  observatory, a house in the city, and 3000 crowns a year for life. So  his instruments were set up once more, students flocked to hear him and  to receive work at his hands--among them a poor youth, John Kepler, to  whom he was very kind, and who became, as you know, a still greater man  than his master.    But the spirit of Tycho was broken, and though some good work was done  at Prague--more observations made, and the Rudolphine tables begun--yet  the hand of death was upon him. A painful disease seized him, attended  with sleeplessness and temporary delirium, during the paroxysms of  which he frequently exclaimed, _Ne frustra vixisse videar_. (\"Oh that it  may not appear that I have lived in vain!\")    Quietly, however, at last, and surrounded by his friends and relatives,  this fierce, passionate soul passed away, on the 24th of October, 1601.    His beloved instruments, which were almost a part of himself, were  stored by Rudolph in a museum with scrupulous care, until the taking of  Prague by the Elector Palatine's troops. In this disturbed time they got  smashed, dispersed, and converted to other purposes. One thing only was  saved--the great brass globe, which some thirty years after was  recognized by a later king of Denmark as having belonged to Tycho, and  deposited in the Library of the Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen, where  I believe it is to this day.    The island of Huen was overrun by the Danish nobility, and nothing now  remains of Uraniburg but a mound of earth and two pits.    As to the real work of Tycho, that has become immortal enough,--chiefly  through the labours of his friend and scholar whose life we shall  consider in the next lecture.          SUMMARY OF FACTS FOR LECTURE III      _Life and work of Kepler._ Kepler was born in December, 1571, at Weil in  Wuertemberg. Father an officer in the duke's army, mother something of a  virago, both very poor. Kepler was utilized as a tavern pot-boy, but  ultimately sent to a charity school, and thence to the University of  Tuebingen. Health extremely delicate; he was liable to violent attacks  all his life. Studied mathematics, and accepted an astronomical  lectureship at Graz as the first post which offered. Endeavoured to  discover some connection between the number of the planets, their times  of revolution, and their distances from the sun. Ultimately hit upon his  fanciful regular-solid hypothesis, and published his first book in 1597.  In 1599 was invited by Tycho to Prague, and there appointed Imperial  mathematician, at a handsome but seldom paid salary. Observed the new  star of 1604. Endeavoured to find the law of refraction of light from  Vitellio's measurements, but failed. Analyzed Tycho's observations to  find the true law of motion of Mars. After incredible labour, through  innumerable wrong guesses, and six years of almost incessant  calculation, he at length emerged in his two \"laws\"--discoveries which  swept away all epicycles, deferents, equants, and other remnants of the  Greek system, and ushered in the dawn of modern astronomy.    LAW I. _Planets move in ellipses, with the Sun in one focus._    LAW II. _The radius vector (or line joining sun and planet) sweeps out  equal areas in equal times._    Published his second book containing these laws in 1609. Death of  Rudolph in 1612, and subsequent increased misery and misfortune of  Kepler. Ultimately discovered the connection between the times and  distances of the planets for which he had been groping all his mature  life, and announced it in 1618:--    LAW III. _The square of the time of revolution (or year) of each planet  is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun._    The book in which this law was published (\"On Celestial Harmonies\") was  dedicated to James of England. In 1620 had to intervene to protect his  mother from being tortured for witchcraft. Accepted a professorship at  Linz. Published the Rudolphine tables in 1627, embodying Tycho's  observations and his own theory. Made a last effort to overcome his  poverty by getting the arrears of his salary paid at Prague, but was  unsuccessful, and, contracting brain fever on the journey, died in  November, 1630, aged 59.    A man of keen imagination, indomitable perseverance, and uncompromising  love of truth, Kepler overcame ill-health, poverty, and misfortune, and  placed himself in the very highest rank of scientific men. His laws, so  extraordinarily discovered, introduced order and simplicity into what  else would have been a chaos of detailed observations; and they served  as a secure basis for the splendid erection made on them by Newton.      _Seven planets of the Ptolemaic system--_        Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.      _Six planets of the Copernican system--_        Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.      _The five regular solids, in appropriate order--_        Octahedron, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron, Tetrahedron, Cube.    _Table illustrating Kepler's third law._     +---------+---------------+-----------+---------------+----------------+   |         | Mean distance |   Length  |  Cube of the  |  Square of the |   | Planet.  |   from Sun.  |  of Year. |   Distance.   |     Time.      |   |         |       D       |     T     |      D^3      |      T^2       |   +---------+---------------+-----------+---------------+----------------+   | Mercury |     .3871     |   .24084  |     .05801    |     .05801     |   | Venus   |     "]]]
