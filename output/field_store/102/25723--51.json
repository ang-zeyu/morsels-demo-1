So close was Tom that the unknown collided with  him, and our hero went over on his back. The other person was tossed  back by the force of the impact, but quickly recovered himself, and  dashed away.    Not before, however, Tom had had a chance to glance at his face,  and, to the chagrin of the young inventor, he recognized, by the dim  light of a crescent moon, the countenance of Andy Foger! If  additional evidence was needed Tom fully recognized the form as that  of the town bully.    \"Hold on there, Andy Foger!\" shouted the young inventor. \"What are  you doing in my shed? What right have you in there? What did you  do?\"    Back came the answer through the night:    \"I told you I'd get square with you, and I've done it,\" and then  Andy's footsteps died away, while a mocking laugh floated back to  Tom. What was Andy's revenge?          CHAPTER IX    THE WHIZZER FLIES      For a moment, Tom gazed after the fleeting figure of the cowardly  bully. He was half-minded to give pursuit, and then, realizing that  he could find Andy later if he wanted him, the young inventor  decided his best plan would be to see what damage had been done. For  that damage would follow Andy's secret visit to the shop, Tom was  certain.    Nor was his surmise wrong. Stepping into the building, the lad  switched on the lights, and he could not repress an exclamation of  chagrin as he looked toward his trim little monoplane, the  BUTTERFLY.    Now it was a BUTTERFLY with broken wings, for Andy had slashed the  canvas of the planes in a score of places.    \"The scoundrel!\" growled Tom. \"I'll make him suffer for this! He's  all but ruined my aeroplane.\"    Tom walked around his pet machine. As he came in front, and saw the  propeller, he gave another exclamation. The fine wooden blades of  several layers, gracefully curved, which had cost him so much in  time and labor to build up, and then fashion to the right shape, had  been hacked, and cut with an axe. The propeller was useless!    \"More of Andy's work,\" murmured Tom. \"This is about the worst yet!\"    There came over him a feeling of great despondency, which was  succeeded by a justifiable rage. He wanted to take after the bully,  and give him a merciless beating. Then a calmer mood came over Tom.    \"After all, what's the use?\" he reasoned. \"Whipping Andy wouldn't  mend the BUTTERFLY. She's in bad shape, but I can repair her, when I  get time. Luckily, he didn't meddle with the engine. That's all  right.\" A hasty examination had shown this. \"I guess I won't do  anything now,\" went on Tom. \"I'll have my hands full getting Mr.  Fenwick's airship to run. After that I can come back here and fix up  my own. It's a good thing I don't have to depend on her for making  the trip to Philadelphia. Poor BUTTERFLY! you sure are in a bad  way,\" and Tom felt almost as if he was talking to some living  creature, so wrapped up was he in his trim little monoplane.    After another disheartening look at his air craft, the young  inventor started to leave the shop. He looked at a door, the  fastening of which Andy had broken to gain admittance.    \"I should have had the burglar alarm working, and this would never  have happened,\" reasoned Tom. All the buildings were arranged so  that if any one entered them after a certain hour, an alarm would  ring in the house. But of late, the alarm had not been set, as Tom  and his father were not working on any special inventions that  needed guarding. It was due to this oversight that Andy was able to  get in undetected.    \"But it won't happen again,\" declared Tom, and he at once began  connecting the burglar-apparatus. He went into the house, and told  his father and the engineer what had occurred. They were both  indignant, and the engineer declared that he would sleep with one  eye open all night, ready to respond to the first alarm.    \"Oh, there's no danger of Andy coming back right away,\" said Tom.  \"He's too frightened. I wouldn't be surprised if he disappeared for  a time. He'll be thinking that I'm after him.\"    This proved true, as Andy had left town next morning, and to all  inquiries his mother said he had gone to visit relatives. She was  not aware of her son's meanness, and Tom did not tell her.    Mr. Damon arrived from his home in Waterfield that day, and, with  many \"blessings,\" wanted to know if Tom was ready for the trial of  the electrical airship.    \"Yes, we'll leave for Philadelphia to-morrow,\" was the answer.    \"Are we going in the BUTTERFLY? Bless my watch chain, but I like  that little machine!\"    \"It will be some time before you again have a flight in her,\" said  Tom, sorrowfully, as he told of Andy's act of vandalism.    \"Why, bless my individuality!\" cried Mr. Damon, indignantly. \"I  never heard of such a thing! Never!\"    It did little good to talk of it, however, and Tom wanted to forget  about it. He wished he had time to repair the monoplane before he  left home, but there was much to do to get ready for the trial of  the WHIZZER.    \"When will you be back, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift, as his son and Mr.  Damon departed for the Quaker City the following morning.    \"Hard to say, dad. If I can make a long flight in the WHIZZER I'll  do so. I may even drop down here and pay you a visit. But if I find  there are many more changes to make in her construction, which is  more than likely, I can't say when I'll return. I'll keep you  posted, however, by writing.\"    \"Can't you arrange to send me some wireless messages?\" asked the  older inventor, with a smile.    \"I could, if I had thought to rig up the apparatus on Mr. Fenwick's  airship,\" was the reply. \"I'll hardly have time to do it now,  though.\"    \"Send wireless messages from an aeroplane?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Bless  my gizzard! I never heard of such a thing!\"    \"Oh, it can be done,\" Tom assured him. And this was a fact. Tom had  installed a wireless apparatus on his RED CLOUD recently, and it is  well known that several of the modern biplanes can send wireless  messages. The crossing and bracing wires of the frame are used for  sending wires, and in place of ground conductors there are trailers  which hang below the aeroplane. The current is derived directly from  the engine, and the remaining things needed are a small step-up  transformer, a key and a few other small parts. Tom had gone a step  farther than this, and had also arranged to receive wireless  messages, though few modern aeroplanes are thus equipped as yet.    But, of course, there was no time now to install a wireless  apparatus on Mr. Fenwick's craft. Tom thought he would be lucky if  he got the WHIZZER to make even a short flight.    \"Well, let me hear from you when you can,\" requested Mr. Swift, and  Tom promised. It was some time after that, and many strange things  happened before Tom Swift again communicated with his father, at any  length.    The young inventor had bidden farewell to Miss Nestor the night  previous. She stated that she had a message that day from her  parents aboard the RESOLUTE, which spoke a passing steamer. Mr. and  Mrs. Nestor, and the other guests of Mr. Hosbrook were well, and  anticipated a fine time on reaching the West Indies.    Tom now said good-by to his father, the housekeeper and Mr. Jackson,  not forgetting, of course, Eradicate Sampson.    \"Don't let Andy Foger come sneaking around here, Rad,\" cautioned the  young inventor.    \"'Deed an' I won't!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"Ef he do, I'll hab  Boomerang kick him t' pieces, an' den I'll whitewash him so his own  folks won't know him! Oh, don't you worry, Massa Tom. Dat Andy won't  do no funny business when I'm around!\"    Tom laughed, and started for the station with Mr. Damon. They  arrived in Philadelphia that afternoon, the trip being very slow, as  compared with the one made by the monoplane. They found Mr. Fenwick  anxiously awaiting them, and Tom at once started work on the  airship.    He kept at it until late that night, and resumed early the next  morning. Many more changes and adjustments were made, and that  afternoon, the young inventor said:    \"I think we'll give it a try-out, Mr. Fenwick.\"    \"Do you mean make a flight?\"    \"Yes, if she'll take it; but only a short one. I want to get her up  in the air, and see how she behaves.\"    \"Well, if you find out, after you're up, that she does well, you may  want to take a long flight,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"If you do, why  I have everything aboard necessary for a long voyage. The WHIZZER is  well stocked with provisions.\"    An hour later, the big electric machine was wheeled out into the  yard, for, in spite of her size, four men could easily move the  craft about, so well was she balanced. Aside from a few personal  friends of the inventor, himself, his machinists, Tom and Mr. Damon,  no one was present at the try-out.    Tom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Fenwick climbed into the car which was  suspended below the gas bag, and between the wing-like planes on  either side. The young inventor had decided to make the WHIZZER rise  by scudding her across the ground on the bicycle wheels, with which  she was equipped, and then by using the tilting planes to endeavor  to lift her off the earth. He wanted to see if she would go up that  way, without the use of the gas bag.    All was in readiness. The motor was started and the machinery began  to hum and throb. The propellers gained speed with every revolution.  The airship had been made fast by a rope, to which was attached a  strong spring balance, as it was desired to see how much pull the  engine would give.    \"Eight hundred pounds,\" announced one of the machinists.    \"A thousand would be better, but we'll try it,\" murmured Tom. \"Cast  off!\"    The rope was loosened, and, increasing the speed of the engine, Tom  signalled to the men to give a little momentum to the craft. She  began running over the smooth ground. There was a cheer from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#9)"],[1," had kept on running. So it is no great cause for  wonder that Mr. Swift's son found himself being distanced.    Once, twice he called on the fleeing one to halt, but the man paid  no attention, and did not even turn around. Then the youth wisely  concluded to save his wind for running. He did his best, but was  chagrined to see the man reach the woods ahead of him.    \"I've lost him now,\" thought Tom. \"Well, there's no help for it.\"    Still he did not give up, but kept on through the patch of trees. On  the farther side was Lake Carlopa, a broad and long sheet of water.    \"If he doesn't know the lake's there,\" thought our hero, \"he may  keep straight on. The water will be sure to stop him, and I can  catch him. But what will I do with him after I get him? That's  another question. I guess I've got a right to demand to know what he  was doing around our place, though.\"    But Tom need not have worried on this score. He could hear the  fugitive ahead of him, and marked his progress by the crackling of  the underbrush.    \"I'm almost up to him,\" exulted the young inventor. Then, at the  same moment, he caught sight of the man running, and a glimpse of  the sparkling water of Lake Carlopa. \"I've got him! I've got him!\"  Tom almost cried aloud in his excitement. \"Unless he takes to the  water and swims for it, I've got him!\"    But Tom did not reckon on a very simple matter, and that was the  possibility of the man having a boat at hand. For this is just what  happened. Reaching the lake shore the fugitive with a final spurt  managed to put considerable distance between himself and Tom. Drawn  up on the beach was a little motor-boat. In this, after he had  pushed it from shore, the stranger leaped. It was the work of but a  second to set the engine in motion, and as Tom reached the edge of  the woods and started across the narrow strip of sand and gravel  that was between the water and the trees, he saw the man steering  his craft toward the middle of the lake.    \"Well--I'll--be--jiggered!\" exclaimed the youth. \"Who would have  thought he'd have a motor-boat waiting for him? He planned this  well.\"    There was nothing to do but turn back. Tom had a small rowboat and a  sailing skiff on the lake, but his boathouse was some distance away,  and even if he could get one of his craft out, the motor-boat would  soon distance it.    \"He's gone!\" thought the searcher regretfully.    The man in the motor-boat did not look back. He sat in the bow,  steering the little craft right across the broadest part of Lake  Carlopa.    \"I wonder where he came from, and where he's going?\" mused Tom.  \"That's a boat I never saw on this lake before. It must be a new  one. Well, there's no help for it, I've got to go back and tell dad  I couldn't catch him.\" And with a last look at the fugitive, who,  with his boat, was becoming smaller and smaller every minute, Tom  turned and retraced his steps.          CHAPTER X.    OFF TO ALBANY      \"Did you catch him, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift eagerly when his son  returned, but the inventor needed but a glance at the lad's  despondent face to have his question answered without words, \"Never  mind,\" he added, \"there's not much harm done, fortunately.\"    \"Did he get anything? Any of your plans or models, dad?\"    \"No; not as far as I can discover. My papers in the shop were not  disturbed, but it looked as if the turbine model had been moved. The  only thing missing seems to be a sheet of unimportant calculations.  Luckily I had my most valuable drawings in the safe in the house.\"    \"Yet that man seemed to be putting papers in his pocket, dad. Maybe  he made copies of some of your drawings.\"    \"That's possible, Tom, and I admit it worries me. I can't imagine  who that man is, unless--\"    \"Why, he's one of the three men I saw in Mansburg in the  restaurant,\" said Tom eagerly. \"Two of them tried to get information  here, and now the third one comes. He got away in a motor-boat,\" and  Tom told how the fugitive escaped.    Mr. Swift looked worried. It was not the first time attempts had  been made to steal his inventions, but on this occasion a desperate  and well-organized plan appeared to be on foot.    \"What do you think they are up to, dad?\" asked Tom.    \"I think they are trying to get hold of my turbine motor, Tom. You  know I told you that the financiers were disappointed in the turbine  motor they bought of another inventor. It does not work. To get back  the money they spent in building an expensive plant they must have a  motor that is successful. Hence their efforts to get control of  mine. I don't know whether I told you or not, but some time ago I  refused a very good offer for certain rights in my invention. I knew  it was worth more. The offer came through Smeak & Katch, the  lawyers, and when I refused it they seemed much disappointed. I  think now that this same firm, and the financiers who have employed  them, are trying by all the means in their power to get possession  of my ideas, if not the invention and model itself.\"    \"What can you do, dad?\"    \"Well, I must think. I certainly must take some means to protect  myself. I have had trouble before, but never any like this. I did  not think those men would be so unscrupulous.\"    \"Do you know their names?\"    \"No, only from that telegram we found; the one which the first  stranger dropped. One of them must be Anson Morse. Who the others  are I don't know. But now I must make some plans to foil these  sharpers. I may have to call on you for help, Tom.\"    \"And I'll be ready any time you call on me, dad,\" responded Tom,  drawing himself up. \"Can I do anything for you right away?\"    \"No; I must think out a plan.\"    \"Then I am going to change my motor-cycle a bit. I'll put some more  improvements on it.\"    \"And I will write some letters to my lawyers in Washington and ask  their advice.\" It took Tom the remainder of that day, and part of  the next, to arrange the gasolene and spark control of his machine  to his satisfaction. He had to make two small levers and some  connecting rods. This he did in his own particular machine shop,  which was fitted up with a lathe and other apparatus. The lathe was  run by power coming from a small engine, which was operated by an  engineer, an elderly man to whom Mr. Swift had given employment for  many years. He was Garret Jackson, and he kept so close to his  engine and boiler-room that he was seldom seen outside of it except  when the day's work was done.    One afternoon, a few days after the unsuccessful chase after the  fugitive had taken place, Tom went out for a spin on his  motor-cycle. He found that the machine worked much better, and was  easier to control. He rode about fifteen miles away from home, and  then returned. As he entered the yard he saw, standing on the drive, a  ramshackle old wagon, drawn by a big mule, which seemed, at the time  Tom observed him, to be asleep.    \"I'll wager that's Boomerang,\" said Tom aloud, and the mule opened  its eyes, wiggled its ears and started forward.    \"Whoa dar, Boomerang!\" exclaimed a voice, and Eradicate Sampson  hurried around the corner of the house. \"Dat's jest lake yo',\" went  on the colored man. \"Movin' when yo' ain't wanted to.\" Then, as he  caught sight of Tom, he exclaimed, \"Why, if it ain't young Mistah  Swift! Good lordy! But dat livery brake yo' done fixed on mah wagon  suttinly am fine. Ah kin go down de steepest hill widout ropin' de  wheel.\"    \"Glad of it,\" replied Tom. \"Did you come to do some work?\"    \"Yais, sah, I done did. I found I had some time t' spah, an' thinks  I dere might be some whitewashin' I could do. Yo' see, I lib only  'bout two mile from heah.\"    \"Well, I guess you can do a few jobs,\" said Tom. \"Wait here.\"    He hunted up his father, and obtained permission to set Eradicate at  work cleaning out a chicken house and whitewashing it. The darky was  soon at work. A little later Tom passing saw him putting the  whitewash on thick. Eradicate stopped at the sight of Tom, and made  some curious motions.    \"What's the matter, Rad?\" asked the young inventor.    \"Why, de whitewash done persist in runnin' down de bresh handle an'  inter mah sleeve. I'm soakin' wet from it now, an' I has t' stop  ebery onct in a while 'case mah sleeve gits full.\"    Tom saw what the trouble was. The white fluid did run down the long  brush handle in a small rivulet. Tom had once seen a little rubber  device on a window-cleaning brush that worked well, and he decided  to try it for Eradicate.    \"Wait a minute,\" Tom advised. \"I think I can stop that for you.\"    The colored man was very willing to take a rest, but it did not last  long, for Tom was soon back at the chicken coop. He had a small  rubber disk, with a hole in the center, the size of the brush  handle. Slipping the disk over the wood, he pushed it about half way  along, and then, handing the brush back to the negro, told him to  try it that way.    \"Did yo' done put a charm on mah bresh?\" asked Eradicate somewhat  doubtfully.    \"Yes, a sort of hoodoo charm. Try it now.\"    The darky dipped his brush in the pail of whitewash, and then began  to spread the disinfectant on the sides of the coop near the top.  The surplus fluid started to run down the handle, but, meeting the  piece of rubber, came no farther, and dripped off on the ground. It  did not run down the sleeve of Eradicate.    \"Well, I 'clar t' goodness! That suttinly am a mighty fine charm!\"  cried the colored man. \"Yo' suah am a pert gen'men, all right. Now I  kin work widout stoppin' t' empty mah sleeve ob lime juice ebery  minute. I'se suttinly obliged t' yo'.\"    \"You're welcome, I'm sure,\" replied Tom. \"I think some day I'll  invent a machine for whitewashing, and then--\"    \"Doan't do dat! Doan't do dat!\" begged Eradicate earnestly. \"Dis,  an' makin' dirt disappear, am de only perfessions I got. Doan't go  'ventin' no machine, Mistah Swift.\"    \"All right. I'll wait until you get rich.\"    \"Ha, ha! Den "]]]
