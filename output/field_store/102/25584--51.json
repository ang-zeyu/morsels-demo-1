It runs to the effect that,  on the advance of the Sultan, the Raya    \"fled through the woods and hills towards Seet Bunder Ramessar  followed by the sultan, who cut passages for his cavalry; through  forests before inaccessible. In this manner the roy fled from place to  place for six months, but never dared to appear without the woods. It  was in vain that the favourites of the sultan represented the pursuit  as fruitless and destructive to the troops. He would not desist. At  last his good fortune prevailed. The health of Kishen Roy and his  family became affected by the noxious air of the woods, and they  were warned to quit them by the physicians.... Driven by necessity,  he retired by secret paths to his capital of Beejanuggur. The sultan  despatched an army after him, while he himself, with the ameer al  amra Bahadur Khan and five thousand men, went to amuse himself with  the sight of Seet Bunda Ramessar.    \"The sultan at this place repaired a mosque which had been built  by the officers of Sultan Alla ad Dien Khiljee. He broke down many  temples of the idolaters, and laid waste their country after which  he hastened with all expedition to Beejanuggur.\"    It is a fact that a mosque is declared to have been erected by Malik  Kafur on the sea-coast in 1310, but apparently not at Ramesvaram,  which lies in the extreme south of India, on the eastern coast  opposite the island of Ceylon. Moreover, it is extremely improbable  that a Muhammadan sovereign could, in the fourteenth century A.D.,  have penetrated so far south with such a handful of men. They  would have been harassed at every step by myriads of Hindus, who,  though doubtless trembling at the sight of a Muhammadan, would,  we may be sure, never have permitted 5000 men to traverse in  peace 1000 miles of forest and mountain; for Ramesvaram is fully  500 miles from Vijayanagar. Malik Kafur's expedition is said to  have taken place after the conquest by him of the Ballala Rajah of  Dvarasamudra in Maisur, when he erected a mosque on the SEA-COAST OF  MALABAR, and therefore nowhere near Ramesvaram. Colonel Briggs has  observed this difficulty,[58] and thinks that the place alluded to  must be Sadasivaghur, on the western coast,) south of Goa, adding,  \"The spot ... is called Cape Ramas on our maps.\"[59] He believes,  however, that the remains of an old mosque do exist at Ramesvaram,  and its date should be settled. Leaving it to others better informed  to throw light on this point, I return to Bukka Raya and his doings.    Firishtah says that there were two roads to Vijayanagar:    \"one fit for the passage of armies, the other narrow and difficult. As  the former was lined with ambushes, he chose the latter, through  which he marched with a select-body of troops, and appeared suddenly  in the suburbs of the city.\"    If Mujahid came up from the Malabar coast, the former of these two  roads would perhaps be the usual route adopted by travellers, which  leads through open undulating plains. Avoiding this route, the Sultan  may have turned the Sandur hills by a flank movement to his right,  and approached either along the valley of Sandur or along the valley  which now carries the main road from Bellary to Vijayanagar, between  the Sandur hills and the hills that surround the latter city.    \"Kishen Roy was astonished at his boldness, and sent myriads of his  people to defend the streets. The sultan drove them before him and  gained the bank of a piece of water which alone now divided him from  the citadel, in which Kishen Roy resided. Near this was an eminence,  upon which stood a temple covered with plates of gold and silver set  with jewels, much venerated by the Hindoos, and called in the language  of the country Puttuk. The sultan, esteeming the destruction of it  as a religious obligation, ascended the hill, and having razed the  temple, possessed himself of the precious metals and jewels.\"    The piece of water alluded to may have been the picturesque lake at  Kamalapuram; but which was the temple that Mujahid destroyed? It seems  useless to speculate, considering that the historian only wrote from  tradition after a lapse of two centuries. There are many temples on  hills to choose from, and several pieces of water. But the strangest  part of the story is that we are not told how the Sultan succeeded  in penetrating the outer lines of works, and in reaching a spot which  divided him only from the inner citadel or palace enclosure. It must,  however, be remembered that though in A.D. 1443 Abdur Razzak saw  seven lines of walls, we are not certain how many there were in the  days of Bukka Raya.    At this point Mujahid was attacked and nearly lost his life.    \"The idolaters, upon seeing their object of veneration destroyed,  raised their shrieks and lamentations to the sky. They obliged Kishen  Roy to head them and advanced resolutely in astonishing numbers. Upon  which the sultan formed his disposition. He laid aside his umbrella,  and with one of his arms-bearers, an Afghaun named Mhamood, crossed a  small rivulet to observe the numbers and motions of the infidels. A  Hindoo, who knew the sultan from the horse he rode, resolved, by  revenging the destruction of his gods and country, to gain immortal  reputation for himself. He moved unperceived through the hollows and  broken ground along the bank of the rivulet, had gained the plain,  and was charging towards the sultan at full speed, when Mujahid Shaw,  at a lucky instant, perceiving him, made a sign to Mhamood Afghaun,  who without delay charged the Hindoo. Mhamood's horse rearing, he fell  to the ground. His antagonist, having every advantage, was on the point  of putting him to death, when sultan Mujahid Shaw advanced with the  quickness of lightning. The Hindoo, changing his object, aimed a heavy  stroke at the sultan, giving at the same instant a shout of triumph,  which made the spectators believe his blow was effectual. Luckily, a  helmet of iron saved the head of the sultan, who now inflicted such a  wound on his enemy that he was divided from the shoulder to the navel  and fell dead from his horse,[60] upon which the sultan remounted  Mhamood and joined his army on the other side of the rivulet.\"    A battle ensued in which the Hindus were defeated; but while  the invading force had hardly recovered from their fatigue, the  Raya's brother[61] \"arrived at the city from his government with a  reinforcement of twenty thousand horse and a vast army of foot\"[62]  The fighting then became furious. In the middle of the battle the  Sultan's uncle, Daud Khan,[63] fearful for the safety of his sovereign,  quitted his post at \"Dhunna Sodra\"[64] and joined in the engagement  with distinguished gallantry. The Muhammadans were again victorious;  but the enemy, having taken advantage of Daud Khan's movement,  had captured the abandoned position, and thus seriously threatened  the Sultan's retreat. He therefore left the field, and by skilful  manoeuvring enabled the whole of his force to extricate themselves  in safety from the hills. With between sixty and seventy thousand  prisoners, mostly women, he retreated from Vijayanagar and sat down  before Adoni; but after a siege lasting nine months the attempt was  abandoned, and the Sultan retired to his own territories. Thus ended  the campaign.    Firishtah gives a short account of the kingdom of Vijayanagar at this  period (about 1378 A.D.), from which the following extracts are taken.    \"The princes of the house of Bahmanee maintained themselves by superior  valour only, for in power, wealth, and extent of country the roles  of Beejanuggur were greatly their superiors;\" and he implies that  at this time, as certainly in after years, all Southern India had  submitted to the sway of the Raya.    \"The seaport of Goa,[65] the fortress of Malgaon,[66] ... belonged  to the roy of Beejanuggur, and many districts of Tulghaut[67] were  in his possession. His country was well peopled, and his subjects  submissive to his authority. The roles of Malabar, Ceylon, and other  islands and other countries kept ambassadors at his court, and sent  annually rich presents.\"[68]    We must revert for a moment to the Sultan's uncle and his behaviour  before Vijayanagar. It will be remembered that, filled with the best  intentions, he had quitted his post to defend his king.    \"The sultan, on seeing the standard of Daood Khan, was enraged, but  stifled his displeasure till the gale of victory had waved over the  standards of the faithful. He then called Daood Khan before him, and  gave him a harsh reprimand for quitting a station so important that,  should the enemy gain possession, not a mussulmaun could make his  escape from the city.\"    Daud treasured up his resentment at this treatment, and, being joined  by other disaffected nobles, secretly plotted the assassination of  the Sultan. The conspirators waited till Mujahid was on his way from  Adoni towards Kulbarga, and then one night, that of Friday, April  16, A.D. 1378,[69] while the Sultan was asleep in his tent, Daud,  accompanied by three other men, rushed in and stabbed him. There was  a struggle, and the unfortunate monarch was despatched by the blow  of a sabre.[70] Daud at once proclaimed himself Sultan as nearest  of kin -- Mujahid having no children -- and being acknowledged,  proceeded to Kulbarga, where he was proclaimed.    The assassination of his nephew availed Daud but little, as the  country was at once divided into two opposing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#9)"],[1," fame of Juan de Grijalva that all his  old companions wished him for their chief; but, by a concurrence of  circumstances, this office was conferred upon Hernando Cortez, then  alcalde of Santiago de Cuba, a man comparatively unknown, but destined  to be distinguished among the daring soldiers of that day as the Great  Captain, and to build up a name almost overshadowing that of the  discoverer of America.    The full particulars of all these expeditions form part and parcel of  the history of Yucatan; but to present them in detail would occupy too  large a portion of this work; and, besides, they form part of the great  chain of events which led to the conquest of Mexico, the history of  which, by the gifted author of Ferdinand and Isabella, it is hoped,  will soon adorn the annals of literature.    Among the principal captains in the expeditions both of Grijalva and  Cortez was Don Francisco Montejo, a gentleman of Seville. After the  arrival of Cortez in Mexico, and while he was prosecuting his conquests  in the interior, twice it was considered necessary to send  commissioners to Spain, and on both occasions Don Francisco Montejo was  nominated, the first time with one other, and the last time alone. On  his second visit, besides receiving a confirmation of former grants and  privileges, and a new coat of arms, as an acknowledgment of his  distinguished services rendered to the crown in the expeditions of  Grijalva and Cortez, he obtained from the king a grant for the  pacification and conquest of the inlands (as it is expressed) of  Yucatan and Cozumel, which countries, amid the stirring scenes and  golden prospects of the conquest of Mexico, had been entirely  overlooked.    This grant bears date the eighth day of December, 1526, and, among  other things, stipulated,    That the said Don Francisco de Montejo should have license and power to  conquer and people the said islands of Yucatan and Cozumel:    That he should set out within one year from the date of the instrument:    That he should be governor and captain-general for life:    That he should be adelantado for life, and on his death the office  should descend to his heirs and successors forever.    Ten square leagues of land and four per cent of all the profit or  advantage to be derived from all the lands discovered and peopled were  given to himself, his heirs and successors forever.    Those who should join the expedition under him were for the first three  years to pay only the one tenth part of the gold of the mines, the  fourth year a ninth part, and the per centage should go on increasing  till it reached a fifth part.    They should be exempted from export duty upon the articles they carried  with them, provided they were not taken for barter or sale.    They were allowed portions of land, and, after living on them four  years complete, were to be at liberty to sell them and use them as  their own.    Also to take rebellious Indians for slaves, and to take and buy Indians  held by the caciques as slaves, under the regulations of the council of  the Indies. The tithes or tenth parts were granted to be expended in  churches and ornaments, and things necessary for divine worship.    The last provision, which may seem rather illiberal, if not libellous,  was, that no lawyers or attorneys should go into those lands from the  kingdom of Spain, nor from any other part, on account of the litigation  and controversies that would follow them.    Don Francisco Montejo, now adelantado, is described as \"of the middle  stature, of a cheerful countenance, and gay disposition. At the time of  his arrival here (in Mexico) he was about thirty-five years of age. He  was fitter for business than war, and of a liberal turn, expending more  than he received;\" in which latter qualification for a great enterprise  he could perhaps find his match at the present day.    The adelantado incurred great expenses in the purchase of arms,  ammunition, horses, and provisions; and, selling an estate, which  yielded him two thousand ducats of rent, he fitted out four vessels at  his own expense, and embarked in them four hundred Spaniards, under an  agreement for a certain share of the advantages of the expedition.    In the year 1527 (the month is not known) the armament sailed from  Seville, and, touching at the islands for supplies, it was remarked, as  a circumstance of bad omen, that the adelantado had not on board two  priests, which, under a general provision, every captain, officer, or  subject who had license to discover and people islands or terra firma  within the limits of the King of Spain, was bound to carry with him.    The fleet stopped at the island of Cozumel, where the adelantado had  great difficulty in communicating with the Indians from want of an  interpreter. Taking on board one of them as a guide, the fleet crossed  over to the continent, and came to anchor off the coast. All the  Spaniards went on shore, and, as the first act, with the solemnities  usual in the new conquests, took formal possession of the country in  the name of the king. Gonzalo Nieto planted the royal standard, and  cried out, in a loud voice, \"Espana! Espana! viva Espana!\"    Leaving the sailors on board to take care of the vessel, the Spaniards  landed their arms, ammunition, horses, and provisions, and, remaining  here a few days to rest, from the excessive heat some became sick. The  Indians knew that the Spaniards had established themselves in New  Spain, and were determined to resist this invasion with all their  strength; but, for the moment, they avoided any hostile demonstrations.    As yet the adelantado had only touched along the coast, and knew  nothing of the interior. Experiencing great difficulty from the want of  an interpreter, he commenced his march along the coast under the  guidance of the Indian from Cozumel. The country was well peopled, and,  without committing any violence upon the inhabitants, or suffering any  injury from them, the Spaniards proceeded from town to town until they  arrived at Conil. At this place, the Indians being apparently friendly,  the Spaniards were thrown off their guard; and on one occasion, an  Indian, who came to pay a visit, snatched a hanger from a little negro  slave, and attempted to kill the adelantado. The latter drew his sword  to defend himself, but the soldiers rushed forward and killed the  Indian on the spot.    The adelantado now determined to march from Conil to the province of  Choaca, and from this time they began to experience the dreadful  hardships they were doomed to suffer in subduing Yucatan. There were no  roads; the country was stony, and overgrown with thick woods. Fatigued  with the difficulties of their march, the heat, and want of water, they  arrived at Choaca, and found it deserted: the inhabitants had gone to  join other Indians who were gathering for war. No one appeared to whom  they could give notice of their pacific intentions, and the tidings  that an Indian had been killed had gone before them.    Setting out again, still under the guidance of the Cozumel Indian, they  reached a town named Ake. Here they found themselves confronted by a  great multitude of Indians, who had lain in ambush, concealed in the  woods.    These Indians were armed with quivers of arrows, sticks burned at the  ends, lances pointed with sharp flints, and two-handed swords of very  hard wood. They had flutes, and large sea-shells for trumpets, and  turtle-shells which they struck with deers' horns. Their bodies were  naked, except around the loins, and stained all over with earth of  different colours, and they wore stone rings in their ears and noses.    The Spaniards were astonished at seeing such strange figures, and the  noise that they made with the turtle-shells and horns, accompanied by a  shout of voices, seemed to make the hills quake. The adelantado  encouraged the Spaniards by relating his experience of war with the  Indians, and a fearful battle commenced, which lasted all that day.  Night came to put an end to the slaughter, but the Indians remained on  the ground. The Spaniards had time to rest and bind up their wounds,  but kept watch all night, with the dismal prospect of being destroyed  on the next day.    At daylight the battle began again, and continued fiercely till midday,  when the Indians began to give way. The Spaniards, encouraged by hope  of victory, pressed them till they turned and fled, hiding themselves  in the woods; but, ignorant of the ground, and worn out with constant  fighting, the victors could only make themselves masters of the field.  In this battle more than twelve hundred Indians were killed.    In the beginning of the year 1528, the adelantado determined again, by  slow marches, to reconnoiter the country; and, having discovered the  warlike character of the inhabitants, to avoid as much as possible all  conflict with them. With this resolution, they set out from Ake in the  direction of Chichen Itza, where, by kindness and conciliation, they  got together some Indians, and built houses of wood and poles covered  with palm leaves.    Here the adelantado made one unfortunate and fatal movement.  Disheartened by not seeing any signs of gold, and learning from the  Indians that the glittering metal was to be found in the province of Ba  Khalal, the adelantado determined to send the Captain Davila to found  in that province a town of Spaniards. Davila set out with fifty  foot-soldiers and sixteen horsemen, and from the time of this  separation difficulties and dangers accumulated upon both. All efforts  to communicate with each other proved abortive. After many battles,  perils, and sufferings, those in Chichen Itza saw themselves reduced to  the wretched alternative of dying by hunger or by the hands of the  Indians. An immense multitude of the latter having assembled for their  destruction, the Spaniards left their fortifications, and went out on  the plain to meet them. The "]]]
