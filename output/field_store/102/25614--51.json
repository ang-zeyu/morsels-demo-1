He did  not reach the sixteenth century; and left behind him some engravings  upon copper, now become extremely rare; besides small pictures, one of  which, subscribed with the author's name, in 1484, is in the possession  of the before mentioned house of Corer. The Veronese, who are in  possession of his portrait, amongst those of the painters of their town,  in the Scuola del Nudo, can also boast one of his altarpieces, bearing  the name and date of 1493, in their church of S. Nazario e Celso. Such  information I obtained from Signor Saverio dalla Rosa, a Veronese  painter of merit. Another less distinguished, and somewhat stiff scholar  or imitator of Bellini, has affixed his name in several places, at the  foot of sacred figures, as follows: \"_Marcus Martialis Venetus_;\" and in  a _Purificazione_, existing in the Conservatory of the Penitents, we  meet with the year 1488. And from a _Supper of Emmaus_, belonging to the  family of the Contarini, with the painter's name, we learn that in the  year 1506 he was still alive.    An artist of a better taste appeared in Vincenzio Catena, a wealthy  citizen, who obtained a good deal of celebrity by his portraits and  pictures for private rooms. His masterpiece consists of a Holy family,  in the style of Giorgione, ornamenting the noble Pesaro gallery; and if  he had produced nothing more than this, he would no longer be included  in the present epoch; but his other pieces, exhibiting more traces of  the old style, which remain at San Maurizio, at San Simeone Grande, at  the Carita, and elsewhere, authorise our enumeration of them here. They  are beautiful; but not sufficiently in the modern taste. His reputation,  however, while living, was so great, that in a letter written by Marc  Antonio Michiel from Rome, to Antonio di Marsilio in Venice, dated 11th  of April, 1520, when Raffaello was just deceased and Buonarotti infirm,  it is recommended to Catena to be upon his guard, \"since danger seems to  be impending over all very excellent painters.\"[32] One Giannetto  Cordegliaghi enjoyed also a high reputation, if he be rightly named by  Vasari, who commends him for his soft and delicate manner, superior to  many of his contemporaries; adding, that he had produced an infinite  number of pictures for private persons. In Venice he is termed, I  suppose for the sake of brevity, Cordella; and to him is attributed the  beautiful portrait of the Cardinal Bessarione in the college of La  Carita, with a few other specimens, the rest having dropt into oblivion.  Probably his real name was double, _Cordella Aghi_. It is certain that  Zanetti read, upon a beautiful Madonna, belonging to the learned Zeno,  _Andreas Cordelle Agi, F._ This last is of the same family as Giannetto;  or perhaps also in place of Giannetto, Vasari ought to have written  Andrea; as instead of Jacopo he ought to have said Francesco Squarcione.  Nor can it be denied, that if we except the artists of Verona and  Friuli, this historian was deficient in information, as he himself  declares, relating to the Venetian School. It is sufficient to turn to  his proemium of the life of Carpaccio, in order to observe how many  times, in a very few lines, he is guilty of making mistakes. Of Lazzaro  Sebastiani, he made two painters; two others out of Marco Basaiti,  dividing him into Marco Basarini and Marco Bassiti, and assigning to  each his several works. Moreover, he wrote Vittore Scarpaccia, Vittor  Bellini, Giambatista da Cornigliano, and confounded the labours of all  the three together. Elsewhere we meet with Mansuchi for Mansueti;  Guerriero and Guarriero, instead of Guariento; Foppa is made into Zoppa,  Giolfino into Ursino, Morazone into Mazzone, Bozzato into Bazzacco,  Zuccati into Zuccheri and Zuccherini; and thus he continued to blunder  through other Lombard and Venetian names, insomuch as almost to vie with  Harms, with Cochin, and with similar inaccurate foreigners.    The following names were slightly esteemed or slightly known by Vasari,  and therefore omitted in his history: Piermaria Pennacchi of Trevisi,  and Pier Francesco Bissolo, a Venetian. Of the former there remain two  entablatures, painted for churches, more excellent in point of colouring  than design. One is in Venice, the other at Murano. Of these artists,  Pier Francesco painted on the least extensive scale, but was more  finished and beautiful. His altarpieces in Murano, and in the cathedral  of Trevigi, may be put in competition with those of the elder Palma; and  one in possession of the family of Renier, representing The Meeting of  Simeon, still nearer approaches to the fulness and softness of the  moderns.    Girolamo di San Croce was still more deserving of commemoration than  these. Yet Vasari omitted him; Boschini is silent on the subject; and  Ridolfi has found in him more to blame than to praise, asserting that he  had never freed himself from the ancient style, though flourishing at a  period when the less celebrated geniuses attempted to modernise their  taste. Happily, however, for this distinguished man, not a few of his  best labours have been preserved, of which Zanetti has pronounced his  opinion that, \"he approaches nearer to the manner of Giorgione and  Titian, than any of the others.\" And such commendation is justified by  his altarpiece of S. Parisio, so highly mentioned in the Guide of  Treviso, and which is to be seen at the church of that saint. In Venice  itself there are some of his pictures which display uncommon merit, such  as the _Supper of our Saviour_, with the name of Santa Croce, which is  in S. Martino; and a _Salvatore_, at S. Francesco della Vigna, which  though in a precise taste, shows extreme richness of colouring. There  also appears, at the same place, his picture of the Martyrdom of S.  Lorenzo; a repetition of which is found in the noble house of Collalto,  nearly resembling the original, and in other places. It abounds in  figures of about a palm's length, imitated, in some part, from the  celebrated composition of Bandinelli, engraved by Marc Antonio, whose  impressions to Girolamo proved a rich mine of art, affording originals  for those small but valuable paintings, meant to adorn private rooms. In  none of them, however, was he a mere copyist; he varied the figures, and  more especially the landscapes, in which he was a very skilful hand. In  this manner he produced many of those Bacchanals, which are to be met  with in different collections. In that of the Casa Albani, at Bergamo,  is a S. Gio. Elemosinario (almsgiver) in grand architecture, seen among  a crowd of paupers; and in the collection of Count Carrara, also at  Bergamo, there is a Saviour taken from the Cross, highly valued for the  portrait of the artist, which points to a holy cross, the symbol of his  name. Not any of these productions are embued with traces of the ancient  style. They display a grace of composition, study of foreshortening, and  of the naked parts, a harmony of colours, forming a mixture of different  schools, in which the Roman predominates, and least of all the Venetian.  Further we would refer the reader to what has already been stated at  page 57.    To these Venetian professors, or at least, established in Venice, it  will be proper to add several educated by Giovanni, in the provinces,  and in this way resume the thread of our pictoric history of the state.  There was no place in the whole dominion which did not boast either of  his disciples or imitators. We shall proceed to treat severally of  these, beginning with the name of Conegliano, which he derived from a  city in the Marca Trevigiana, his native place, whose mountainous views  he has introduced into his paintings, as if to serve for his device.    The artist's name, however, is Giambatista Cima, and his style most  resembles the better part of that of Gian Bellini. The professors indeed  may often be confounded together, to such a degree do we find Conegliano  diligent, graceful, lively in his motions and his colouring, although  less smooth than Bellini. Perhaps one of his best pieces that I have  seen, is in the cathedral at Parma, though it is omitted in the  catalogue of his works. That at the church of Santa Maria dell' Orto,  one of the most rich in paintings, in all Venice, possesses less  softness; but in point of architecture, in the air of its heads, and in  the distribution of its colours, there is something so extremely  attractive, that we are never weary of contemplating it. The different  collections in Italy, no less than those in other parts, are many of  them in possession, or said to be in possession, of specimens from this  artist's hand; and if we add to these his altarpieces, sufficiently  numerous, they will be found to amount to a very considerable class. We  are informed, however, by Padre Federici, that one of Cima's sons, of  the name of Carlo, imitated so closely the style of his father, that  there are pictures which ought often to be attributed to the former  instead of to the latter.    This artist resided but a short time in his own province; and the  altarpiece placed by him in the cathedral of his native place, in 1493,  is considered a youthful performance. He continued to exercise his art  until the year 1517, according to Ridolfi, and died in the maturity of  his powers. The date of 1542, which we find at San Francesco di Rovigo  placed upon an altarpiece of Conegliano, (if it be not a copy,) marks  only the era of the erecting of the altar, which was painted afterwards.  He is said by Boschini to have been the tutor of Vittor Belliniano, by  Vasari called Bellini; the same who represented in the college of St.  Mark's, the martyrdom of the saint. The best portion of this history is  the architecture it displays.    The artists, educated in the school of Giovanni, who flourished at  Friuli, were two natives of Udine: Giovanni di M.

How do you  account for such a man being reduced to solicit the demd pannikin of flour?\"    \"Easy,\" retorted the sansculotte:  \"the duke had jist settled down  to his proper (adj.) level--like the bloke you'll see in the bottom  of a new pannikin when you're drinkin' out of it.\"    \"Mosey,\" said Cooper impressively; \"if I git up off o' this blanket,  I'll kick\"--(I did n't catch the rest of the sentence).  \"Give us none  o' your (adj.) Port Phillip ignorance here.\"    \"You can git a drink o' good water in ole Vic., anyhow,\" sneered Mosey,  with the usual flowers of speech.    \"An' that's about all you can git,\" muttered Cooper, faithfully following  the same ornate style of diction.    \"Now, Mosey,\" said Willoughby, courteously but tenaciously,  \"will you permit me to enumerate a few gentlemen--gentlemen, remember--  who have exhibited in a marked degree the qualities of the pioneer.  Let us begin with those men of whom you Victorians are so justly proud,--  Burke and Wills.  Then you have----\"    \"Hold on, hold on,\" interrupted Mosey.  \"Don't go no furder, for Gossake.  Yer knockin' yerself bad, an' you don't know it.  Wills was  a pore harmless weed, so he kin pass; but look'ere--there ain't a drover,  nor yet a bullock driver, nor yet a stock-keeper, from 'ere to 'ell  that could n't 'a' bossed that expegition straight through to the Gulf,  an' back agen, an' never turned a hair--with sich a season as Burke had.  Don't sicken a man with yer Burke.  He burked that expegition, right enough.  ''Howlt! Dis-MOUNT!' Grand style o' man for sich a contract! I tell you,  that (explorer) died for want of his sherry an' biscakes.  Why, the ole man,  here, seen him out beyond Menindie, with his----\"    \"Pardon me, Mosey--was Mr. Price connected with the expedition?\"    \"No (adj.) fear!\" growled Price resentfully.  \"Jist happened to be there  with the (adj.) teams.  Went up with stores, an' come down with wool.\"    Willoughby, who probably had wept over the sufferings of Burke's party  on their way to Menindie, seemed badly nonplussed.  He murmured acquiescence  in Price's authority; and Mosey continued,    \"Well, the ole man, here, seen him camped, with his carpet, an' his bedsteed,  an' (sheol) knows what paravinalia; an' a man nothin' to do but wait on him;  an'--look here!--a cubbard made to fit one o' the camels, with compartments  for his swell toggery, an'--as true as I'm a livin' sinner!--  one o' the compartments made distinctly o' purpose to hold his belltopper!\"    \"Quite so,\" replied Willoughby approvingly.  \"We must bear in mind  that Burke had a position to uphold in the party; and that,  to maintain subordination, a commander must differentiate himself by\"--    \"It's Gord's truth, anyhow,\" remarked Price, rousing his mind from a retrospect  of its extensive past.  And, no doubt, the old man was right;  for a relic, answering to Mosey's description, was sold by auction  in Melbourne, with other assets of the expedition, upon Brahe's return.    \"They give him a lot o' credit for dyin' in the open,\" continued  the practical little wretch, with masterly handling of expletive--  \"but I want to know what else a feller like him could do,  when there was no git out?  An' you'll see in Melb'n', there, a statue of him,  made o' cast steel, or concrete, or somethin', standin' as bold as brass  in the middle o' the street! My word! An' all the thousands o' pore beggars  that's died o' thirst an' hardship in the back country--all o' them  a dash sight better men nor Burke knowed how to be--where's theyre statutes?  Don't talk rubbage to me.  Why, there was no end to that feller's childishness.  Before he leaves Bray at Cooper's Creek, he drors out--what do you think?--  well, he drors out a plan o' forti--(adj.)--fications, like they got  in ole wore-out countries; an' Bray had to keep his fellers workin' an' cursin'  at this thing till the time come for them to clear.  An' mind you, this was  among the tamest blackfellers in the world.  Why, Burke was dotin'.  Wants a young feller, with some life in him, for to boss a expegition; an'  on top o' Burke's swellishness an' uselessness, dash me if he wasn't forty!\"    \"Well, no; he war n't too old, Mosey,\" interposed Price deprecatingly.  \"Wants a experienced man fer sich work.  Same time, you could n't best Burke  fer a counterfit.\"    \"Sing'lar thing, you'll never hear one good word o' that man,\" observed Cooper.  \"Different from all the other explorers.  Can't account for it, no road.\"    \"Another singular thing is that you'll never read a word against him,\"  added Thompson.  \"In conversation, you'll always learn that Burke  never did a thing worth doing or said a thing worth saying;  and that his management of that expedition would have disgraced  a new-chum schoolboy; and old Victorian policemen will tell you  that he left the force with the name of a bully and a snob, and a man  of the smallest brains.  Wonder why these things never get into print.\"    \"De mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent maxim, Thompson,\"  remarked Willoughby.    \"It is that,\" retorted Mosey.  \"Divil a fear but they'll nicely bone anythin'  in the shape o' credit.  Toffs is no slouches at barrickin'  for theyre own push.  An' I'll tell you another dash good maximum,--  it's to keep off of weltin' a dyin' man.\"    \"Did you ever read Burke's Diary, Willoughby?\" asked Thompson.  \"It's just two or three pages of the foolishest trash that any man  ever lost time in writing; and I'm afraid it's about a fair sample of Burke.  I wish you could talk to some fellows that I know--Barefooted Bob,  for instance.  Now, there's a man that was never known to say a thing  that he was n't sure of; and he's been all over the country  that Burke was over, and heard all that is to be known of the expedition.  And Bob's a man that goes with his eyes open.  I wish you could talk to him.  Lots of information in the back country that never gets down here  into civilisation .\"    \"There is a certain justice in Mosey's contention,\" I remarked,  addressing Willoughby.  \"He argues that, as Burke, by dying of hardship,  earned himself a statue, so Brown, Jones, and Robinson--whose souls, we trust,  are in a less torrid climate than their unburied bones--should,  in bare justice, have similar post-obituary recognition.  For Burke's sake,  of course, the comparison in value of service had better not be entered on.  Mosey would have our cities resemble ancient Athens in respect of having  more public statues than living citizens.\"    \"Your allusion to Athens is singularly happy,\" replied the whaler;  \"but you will remember that the Athenians were, in many respects,  as exclusive as ourselves.  The impassable chasm which separates  your illustrious explorer from Brown, Jones, and Robinson,  existed also in Athens, though, perhaps, not so jealously guarded.  But let us change the subject.\"    \"Yes; do,\" said Cooper cordially.  \"I hate argyin'.  Fust go off,  it's all friendly;--'Yes, my good man.'--'No, my dear feller.'--'Don't run away  with that idear.'--'You're puttin' the boot on the wrong foot.'--  'You got the wrong pig by the tail.'--an' so on, as sweet as sugar.  But by-'n'-by it's, 'To (sheol) with you for a (adj.) fool!'--  'You're a (adj.) liar!'--'Who the (adj.  sheol) do you think  you're talking to?'--an' one word fetchin' on another till it grows  into a sort o' unpleasantness.\"    \"Hear anything of Bob and Bat lately?\" asked Thompson, after a pause.    \"Both gone to have a confab with Burke; an' good enough for the likes o' them,\"  replied Mosey.  \"Them sort o' varmin's the curse o' the country.  I ain't a very honorable sort, myself, but I'd go on one feed every two days  before I'd come as low as them.  Well, couple or three year ago, you know,  ole M'Gregor he sent the (adj.) skunks out with cattle to some new country,  a hundred mile beyond (sheol); an' between hardship, an' bad tucker,  an' bad conscience, they both pegged out.  So a feller from the Diamantinar  told me a fortnit ago.\"    \"Smart fellows in their way,\" remarked Thompson.  \"I don't bear them  any malice, though they rounded me up twice, and made me fork out each time.\"    \"Boolka horse-paddick?\" suggested Mosey.  \"They grabbed us there once,  an' it was touch-an'-go another time.  But the place is worth a bit o' risk.\"    \"No; both times it was on Wo-Winya, on the Deniliquin side,\" replied Thompson.  \"First time was about nine years ago.  Bob and Bat were dummying on the station  at the time, and looking after the Skeleton paddock.  Flash young fellers  they were then.  Cunningham and I worked on that paddock one night, as usual,  coming up empty from the Murray.  Of course, we were out in the morning  at grey daylight, but it was a bit foggy, and instead of finding the bullocks,  we found Bob and Bat cantering round, looking for them.  Cunningham and I separated, and so did the other two; and the four of us  spent the liveliest half-hour you could wish for; chasing, and crossing,  and meeting one another in all directions, and not a word spoken,  and not a hoof to be seen.  At last the fog lifted a bit, and Cunningham  spotted cattle in a timbered swamp, but Bat was between him and them;  so he circled round gently, and was edging up to get a good start  when Bat took the alarm, and saw the cattle; then it was  neck-or-nothing with them for possession.  Bob and I happened to be in sight  and when we saw our mates go off on the jump, we both went for the same spot.  Cunningham beat Bat by "]]]
