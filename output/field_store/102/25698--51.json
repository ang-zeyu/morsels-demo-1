In 1808, a Missouri Company engaged in fur  hunting on the three forks of the river Missouri, were attacked by  Blackfeet, losing twenty-seven men, and being compelled to abandon the  country. In 1823, Mr. Ashley was attacked on the same river by the  Arickaras, and had twenty-six men killed. About the same time the  Missouri company lost seven men, and fifteen thousand dollars' worth of  merchandise on the Yellowstone River. A few years previous, Major Henry  lost, on the Missouri River, six men and fifty horses. In the sketch  given of Smith's trading adventures is shown how uncertain were life and  property at a later period. Of the two hundred men whom Wyeth led into  the Indian country, only about forty were alive at the end of three  years. There was, indeed, a constant state of warfare between the  Indians and the whites, wherever the American Companies hunted, in which  great numbers of both lost their lives. Add to this cause of decimation  the perils from wild beasts, famine, cold, and all manner of accidents,  and the trapper's chance of life was about one in three.    Of the causes which have produced the enmity of the Indians, there are  about as many. It was found to be the case almost universally, that on  the first visit of the whites the natives were friendly, after their  natural fears had been allayed. But by degrees their cupidity was  excited to possess themselves of the much coveted dress, arms, and goods  of their visitors. As they had little or nothing to offer in exchange,  which the white man considered an equivalent, they took the only method  remaining of gratifying their desire of possession, and _stole_ the  coveted articles which they could not purchase. When they learned that  the white men punished theft, they murdered to prevent the punishment.  Often, also, they had wrongs of their own to avenge. White men did not  always regard their property-rights. They were guilty of infamous  conduct toward Indian women. What one party of whites told them was  true, another plainly contradicted, leaving the lie between them. They  were overbearing toward the Indians on their own soil, exciting to  irrepressible hostility the natural jealousy of the inferior toward the  superior race, where both are free, which characterizes all people. In  short, the Indians were not without their grievances; and from barbarous  ignorance and wrong on one side, and intelligent wrong-doing on the  other, together with the misunderstandings likely to arise between two  entirely distinct races, grew constantly a thousand abuses, which  resulted in a deadly enmity between the two.    For several reasons this evil existed to a greater degree among the  American traders and trappers than among the British. The American  trapper was not, like the Hudson's Bay employees, bred to the business.  Oftener than any other way he was some wild youth who, after an  _escapade_ in the society of his native place, sought safety from  reproach or punishment in the wilderness. Or he was some disappointed  man who, with feelings embittered towards his fellows, preferred the  seclusion of the forest and mountain. Many were of a class disreputable  everywhere, who gladly embraced a life not subject to social laws. A few  were brave, independent, and hardy spirits, who delighted in the  hardships and wild adventures their calling made necessary. All these  men, the best with the worst, were subject to no will but their own; and  all experience goes to prove that a life of perfect liberty is apt to  degenerate into a life of license. Even their own lives, and those of  their companions, when it depended upon their own prudence, were but  lightly considered. The constant presence of danger made them reckless.  It is easy to conceive how, under these circumstances, the natives and  the foreigners grew to hate each other, in the Indian country;  especially after the Americans came to the determination to \"shoot an  Indian at sight,\" unless he belonged to some tribe with whom they had  intermarried, after the manner of the trappers.    [Illustration: WATCHING FOR INDIAN HORSE-THIEVES.]    On the other hand, the employees of the Hudson's Bay Company were many  of them half-breeds or full-blooded Indians of the Iroquois nation,  towards whom nearly all the tribes were kindly disposed. Even the  Frenchmen who trapped for this company were well liked by the Indians on  account of their suavity of manner, and the ease with which they adapted  themselves to savage life. Besides most of them had native wives and  half-breed children, and were regarded as relatives. They were trained  to the life of a trapper, were subject to the will of the Company, and  were generally just and equitable in their dealings with the Indians,  according to that company's will, and the dictates of prudence. Here was  a wide difference.    Notwithstanding this, there were many dangers to be encountered. The  hostility of some of the tribes could never be overcome; nor has it ever  abated. Such were the Crows, the Blackfeet, the Cheyennes, the Apaches,  the Camanches. Only a superior force could compel the friendly offices  of these tribes for any white man, and then their treachery was as  dangerous as their open hostility.    It happened, therefore, that although the Hudson's Bay Company lost  comparatively few men by the hands of the Indians, they sometimes found  them implacable foes in common with the American trappers; and  frequently one party was very glad of the others' assistance.  Altogether, as has before been stated, the loss of life was immense in  proportion to the number employed.    Very few of those who had spent years in the Rocky Mountains ever  returned to the United States. With their Indian wives and half-breed  children, they scattered themselves throughout Oregon, until when, a  number of years after the abandonment of the fur trade, Congress donated  large tracts of land to actual settlers, they laid claim, each to his  selected portion, and became active citizens of their adopted state.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE FUR COUNTRY.]          A TRAPPER AND PIONEER'S LIFE.          CHAPTER I.      As has been stated in the Introduction, Joseph L. Meek was a native of  Washington Co., Va. Born in the early part of the present century, and  brought up on a plantation where the utmost liberty was accorded to the  \"young massa;\" preferring out-door sports with the youthful bondsmen of  his father, to study with the bald-headed schoolmaster who furnished him  the alphabet on a paddle; possessing an exhaustless fund of waggish  humor, united to a spirit of adventure and remarkable personal strength,  he unwittingly furnished in himself the very material of which the  heroes of the wilderness were made. Virginia, \"the mother of  Presidents,\" has furnished many such men, who, in the early days of the  now populous Western States, became the hardy frontiers-men, or the  fearless Indian fighters who were the bone and sinew of the land.    When young Joe was about eighteen years of age, he wearied of the  monotony of plantation life, and jumping into the wagon of a neighbor  who was going to Louisville, Ky., started out in life for himself. He  \"reckoned they did not grieve for him at home;\" at which conclusion  others besides Joe naturally arrive on hearing of his heedless  disposition, and utter contempt for the ordinary and useful employments  to which other men apply themselves.    Joe probably believed that should his father grieve for him, his  step-mother would be able to console him; this step-mother, though a  pious and good woman, not being one of the lad's favorites, as might  easily be conjectured. It was such thoughts as these that kept up his  resolution to seek the far west. In the autumn of 1828 he arrived in St.  Louis, and the following spring he fell in with Mr. Wm. Sublette, of the  Rocky Mountain Fur Company, who was making his annual visit to that  frontier town to purchase merchandise for the Indian country, and pick  up recruits for the fur-hunting service. To this experienced leader he  offered himself.    [Illustration: THE ENLISTMENT.]    \"How old are you?\" asked Sublette.    \"A little past eighteen.\"    \"And you want to go to the Rocky Mountains?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You don't know what you are talking about, boy. You'll be killed before  you get half way there.\"    \"If I do, I reckon I can die!\" said Joe, with a flash of his fall dark  eyes, and throwing back his shoulders to show their breadth.    \"Come,\" exclaimed the trader, eyeing the youthful candidate with  admiration, and perhaps a touch of pity also; \"that is the game spirit.  I think you'll do, after all. Only be prudent, and keep your wits about  you.\"    \"Where else should they be?\" laughed Joe, as he marched off, feeling an  inch or two taller than before.    Then commenced the business of preparing for the journey--making  acquaintance with the other recruits--enjoying the novelty of owning an  outfit, being initiated into the mysteries of camp duty by the few old  hunters who were to accompany the expedition, and learning something of  their swagger and disregard of civilized observances.    On the 17th of March, 1829, the company, numbering about sixty men, left  St. Louis, and proceeded on horses and mules, with pack-horses for the  goods, up through the state of Missouri. Camp-life commenced at the  start; and this being the season of the year when the weather is most  disagreeable, its romance rapidly melted away with the snow and sleet  which varied the sharp spring wind and the frequent cold rains. The  recruits went through all the little mishaps incident to the business  and to their inexperience, such as involuntary somersaults over the  heads of their mules, bloody noses, bruises, dusty faces, bad colds,  accidents in fording streams,--yet withal no very serious hurts or  hindrances.

The term \"_pedes ambulatorii_,\" or walking-feet, is applied too generally,  and should be confined to the gallinaceous and Pigeon tribes.    This genus was formed by Count Hoffmansegg, and the present is the smallest  species known: our figure is of the male bird. Total length about five  inches and a half. The bill from the angle to the tip measures seven lines;  but from the nostrils only three lines and a half. The middle of the body,  vent, and under tail-covers in the male are pure white; in the female  yellowish, with a line of olive-green down the middle of each shaft; the  quills, wing-covers, and tail-feathers are black, margined in the male with  blue, and in the female with green: the tail is slightly forked. The  nostrils round and bare; the base of the bill has a few weak setaceous  hairs. The legs resemble the true Chatterers, having the outer toe rather  longer than the inner, and attached to the base of the middle.    This is a scarce bird, apparently not hitherto described; I met with it  only three times in Bahia; but it appears more frequent in the southern  provinces of Brazil, specimens having been sent me from Minas Geralis and  Rio de Janeiro.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 22    [Illustration]    TERIAS Elvina.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae breves, clava subtruncata, compressa.

The genus I have now placed it in belongs to the _Coliadae_, and appears to  connect that family with the _Pieridae_: their distinctions are obviously  marked and very constant in all the species I have yet seen, and which are  tropical: of these, seven I discovered in Brazil; three or four more are  natives of the southern extremity of North America; and Dr. Horsfield has  four or five from Java. I know of none from Africa. Their size in general  is very small.    I think this species is the _Pieris Elvina_ of Godart; although the insect  he mentions as the female is in reality that of his _Pieris Neda_. The true  female I have never seen; I suspect it will want the gibbous curve on the  hinder wings of the male, which sex is, indeed, not common, and is  generally much smaller, and sometimes half the size only, of the figure.    _Papilio Nicippe_ of Cramer (tab. 210. fig. C. D.) strictly belongs to this  genus, though placed in that of _Colias_ by Godart, as well as his _Pieris  Agave_, _Hecabe_, and doubtless many others not now before me.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 23    [Illustration]    MITRA vittata.    _Ribbon Mitre._           *       *       *       *       *    CHARACTER GENERICUS.        _Testa inaequaliter fusiformis, spira producta attenuata; labio      exteriore intus edentato.

Banks, from the  Pacific Ocean: it is now, together with his entire collection of shells and  insects, in the Museum of the Linnaean Society.    It is of great rarity, and the present specimen far exceeds in size any I  have yet seen. A very perfect one exists in my father's collection which  measures only two inches one line long: it differs slightly in wanting the  lower white band and its inferior border: there is also an additional small  plait between the second and third, a variation not uncommon in the  Linnaean Volutes, and which lessens the importance of this character as a  specific distinction.    It is unfigured, and I believe undescribed, unless perhaps in Solander's  MSS. In its small state it may have been overlooked as one of the numerous  varieties of _M. vulpecula_; but the sharp angulated plaitings, the  cancellated base, and the numerous faintly-grooved lines on the spire, as  well as the more slender and lengthened form, will at once distinguish it:  its colours also are very striking and dissimilar.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 24    [Illustration]    CONOELIX.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa coniformis; spira brevissima; labium exterius simplex; columella      plicata; apertura linearis, angusta, spira longior._    Typus Genericus _Conoelix lineatus_.
