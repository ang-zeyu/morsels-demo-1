In the sample studied  a call-group contains 0-28 secondary notes (generally about 3). The  mean duration of the primary is 0.091 (0.07-0.11) second and that of  the secondaries is 0.040 (0.025-0.06) second.    _Hyla phlebodes_ and _sartori_ have call-groups composed of a rather  short, unpaired primary and several short, unpaired secondaries  (0-28 in _phlebodes_, 0-23 in _sartori_). The mean duration of the  primary of _phlebodes_ is 0.105 (0.07-0.16) second and that of the  secondaries is 0.067 (0.035-0.12) second. The mean duration of the  primary of _sartori_ is 0.080 (0.07-0.09) second and that of the  secondaries is 0.053 (0.035-0.07) second.    The two subspecies of _H. microcephala_ are identical in call pattern  and agree closely in duration of notes, although those of the nominate  subspecies tend to be slightly longer. _Hyla robertmertensi_ is  distinctive in call pattern in that it is the only species having a  paired primary; the duration of the primary is completely overlapped by  that in the other species, but the secondaries tend to be the shortest  in the group. The call patterns of _H. phlebodes_ and _H. sartori_ are  identical and the range of duration of notes of _phlebodes_ completely  overlaps that of _sartori_, although both the primary and secondary  notes of the latter tend to be somewhat shorter (Table 5, Pl. 16).    _Fundamental frequency._--This parameter was analyzed for the primary  notes. It was measured for the secondaries as well and was found to  differ in magnitude in the same way as the primary note. In a few  examples of both subspecies of _H. microcephala_ a high primary note,  in which the fundamental frequency is exceptionally high, is sometimes  emitted (Fouquette, 1960b). None of these notes was used in this  analysis; only the fundamental frequencies of normal primary notes are  compared (Table 5, Fig. 7).

There is considerable overlap, but the difference  between the means is significant at the 0.001 level of probability  (t = 4.2406). The call of _H. robertmertensi_ does not overlap that  of _H. sartori_ or either subspecies of _H. microcephala_ in this  parameter; but it does overlap that of _H. phlebodes_, although again  the difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level  (t = 9.360). _Hyla phlebodes_ and _sartori_ have the lowest fundamental  frequencies, and there is some overlap, but here too the difference  between the means is significant at the 0.001 level (t = 4.923).    _Dominant frequency._--A dominant band of frequencies cuts across  the harmonics of the fundamental, obscuring the harmonic pattern and  generally shifting upward in frequency. The midpoint of this band is  measured at the terminal border as the dominant frequency. As with the  fundamental frequency, only the normal primary notes were utilized in  the comparisons (Table 5, Fig 8).        [Illustration: Fig. 7. Variation in the fundamental frequency of the        normal primary notes in the _Hyla microcephala_ group. The        horizontal lines = range of variation, vertical lines = mean,        solid bars = twice the standard error of the mean, and open        bars = one standard deviation. The number of specimens in each        sample is indicated in parentheses after the name of the taxon.]      The two subspecies of _H. microcephala_ agree more closely in this  parameter than in fundamental frequency. The overlap is great, but the  difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level  (t = 3.658). The calls of both subspecies completely overlap that of  _robertmertensi_ in this parameter, but the difference between the  means is significant at the 0.001 level. The calls of _H. phlebodes_  and _H. sartori_ overlap considerably in this characteristic, although  the difference between the means is significant at the 0.001 level  (t = 7.504) (Fig. 9). The call of neither species overlaps those of  _H. microcephala_ and _robertmertensi_.        [Illustration: Fig. 8.

The number of        specimens in each sample is indicated in parentheses after the        name of the taxon.]        [Illustration: Fig. 9. Scatter diagram relating the dominant and        fundamental frequencies of the normal primary notes in the        _Hyla microcephala_ group. Each symbol represents a different        individual.]      _Repetition rate._--The repetition rate of the secondary notes, in  calls consisting of more than one secondary, was measured for each  form. A considerable amount of variation in this parameter was found  in all of the taxa (Table 5). This variation probably is due in part  to the effect of temperature differences. Repetition rate is the only  parameter analyzed for which there is a correlation with the  air-temperature, but even here the correlation is weak, probably due  to the microenvironmental effects of humidity, air-movement, and other  factors in addition to the ambient air temperature that influences the  body temperature of the frogs. These rates are nearly alike in both  subspecies of _H. microcephala_ and in _phlebodes_. The repetition  rates in _H. robertmertensi_ and _H. sartori_ are considerably faster  than in the other three taxa. _Hyla sartori_ has the fastest  repetition rate of the group.    In all characteristics of the mating calls the two subspecies of  _H. microcephala_ agree closely, as might be expected, although the  differences are statistically significant. _Hyla robertmertensi_ is  distinctive in call pattern and seems to be closer to _microcephala_  in dominant frequency but closer to _H. phlebodes_ in fundamental  frequency. Thus, it is somewhat intermediate between _microcephala_  and _phlebodes_. The identical pattern and similarity in fundamental  and dominant frequencies of the calls of _H. phlebodes_ and _H. sartori_  possibly indicate close relationship.    _Geographic variation in call._--_Hyla m. microcephala_ has higher  fundamental and dominant frequencies in Costa Rica than in Panama. In  Costa Rican _H. m. underwoodi_ the fundamental and dominant frequencies  are lower than in other parts of the range. Frogs of this subspecies  recorded in Nicaragua and Honduras have slightly lower dominant  frequencies and higher fundamental frequencies than those recorded in  Guatemala or Oaxaca. The duration of both primary and secondary notes  decreases to the south; samples from Nicaragua and Costa Rica have the  shortest notes. Comparison of duration of notes in the two subspecies  shows that the Panamanian _H. m. microcephala_ have slightly longer  notes than do any _H. m. underwoodi_; the more northern populations of  _H. m. underwoodi_ from Mexico most closely approach _H. m.  microcephala_ in this characteristic.    The calls of _H. robertmertensi_ in Oaxaca have higher dominant and  fundamental frequencies and longer secondary notes than do those in  Chiapas.    The calls of _H. phlebodes_ recorded at Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica,  have slightly lower dominant frequencies than do those recorded at  Turrialba, Costa Rica, and in Panama, whereas those recorded at  Turrialba have lower fundamental frequencies than in other samples.  The duration of notes is slightly shorter in both Costa Rican samples  than in those recorded in Panama.          LIFE HISTORY      The frogs of the _Hyla microcephala_ group breed in shallow grassy  ponds. In some places they breed in permanent ponds, but usually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#9)"],[1,"our hooks to the bottom, we waited some twenty  minutes, when he had a bite, and, having strong tackle, soon took in a  trout that turned the scale at 2-1/4 pounds. Then my turn came and I  saved one weighing 1-1/2 pounds. He caught another of 1-1/4 pounds, and  I took one of 1 pound. Then they ceased biting altogether.    \"And now,\" said my friend, \"if you will work your canoe carefully around  to that old balsam top and get the light where you can see the bottom,  you may see some large trout.\"    I did as directed, and, making a telescope of my hand, looked intently  for the bottom of the spring-hole. At first I could see nothing but  water; then I made out some dead sticks, and finally began to dimly  trace the outlines of large fish. There they were, more than forty of  them, lying quietly on the bottom like suckers, but genuine brook trout,  every one of them.    \"This,\" said he, \"makes the fifth time I have brushed them out of here,  and I have never missed taking from two to five large trout. I have two  other places where I always get one or two, but this is the best.\"    At the hotel we found two fly-fishers who had been out all the morning.  They each had three or four small trout.    During the next week we worked the spring-holes daily in the same way,  and always with success. I have also had good success by building a  bright fire on the bank, and fishing a spring-hole by the light--a mode  of fishing especially successful with catties and perch.    A bright, bull's-eye headlight, strapped on a stiff hat, so that the  light can be thrown where it is wanted, is an excellent device for night  fishing. And during the heated term, when fish are slow and sluggish, I  have found the following plan works well: Bake a hard, well salted,  water \"johnny-cake,\" break it into pieces the size of a hen's egg, and  drop the pieces into a spring-hole. This calls a host of minnows, and  the larger fish follow the minnows. It will prove more successful on  perch, catties, chubs, etc., than on trout, however. By this plan, I  have kept a camp of five men well supplied with fish when their best  flies failed--as they mostly do in very hot weather.    Fishing for mascalonge, pickerel, and bass, is quite another thing,  though by many valued as a sport scarcely inferior to fly-fishing for  trout. I claim no especial skill with the fly-rod. It is a good day when  I get my tail fly more than fifteen yards beyond the reel, with any  degree of accuracy.    My success lies mainly with the tribes of Esox and Micropterus. Among  these, I have seldom or never failed during the last thirty-six years,  when the water was free of ice; and I have had just as good luck when  big-mouthed bass and pickerel were in the \"off season,\" as at any time.  For in many waters there comes a time--in late August and  September--when neither bass nor pickerel will notice the spoon, be it  handled never so wisely. Even the mascalonge looks on the flashing cheat  with indifference; though a very hungry specimen may occasionally  immolate himself. It was at such a season that I fished High Bank  Lake--as before mentioned--catching from forty to fifty pounds of fine  fish every morning for nearly two weeks, after the best local fishermen  had assured me that not a decent sized fish could be taken at that  season. Perhaps a brief description of the modes and means that have  proved invariably successful for many years may afford a few useful  hints, even to old anglers.    [Sidenote: Frog-Bait and Gangs]    To begin with, I utterly discard all modern \"gangs\" and \"trains,\"  carrying from seven to thirteen hooks each. They are all too small, and  all too many; better calculated to scratch and tear, than to catch and  hold. Three hooks are enough at the end of any line, and better than  more. These should be fined or honed to a perfect point, and the abrupt  part of the barb filed down one-half. All hooks, as usually made, have  twice as much barb as they should have; and the sharp bend of the barb  prevents the entering of the hook in hard bony structures, wherefore the  fish only stays hooked so long as there is a taut pull on the line. A  little loosening of the line and shake of the head sets him free. But  no fish can shake out a hook well sunken in mouth or gills, though  two-thirds of the barb be filed away.    [Illustration: FROG-BAIT]    [Illustration: THREE-HOOK GANG]    For mascalonge or pickerel I invariably use wire snells made as follows:  Lay off four or more strands of fine brass wire 13 inches long; turn one  end of the wires smoothly over a No. 1 iron wire, and work the ends in  between the strands below. Now, with a pair of pincers hold the ends,  and, using No. 1 as a handle, twist the ends and body of the snell  firmly together; this gives the loop; next, twist the snell evenly and  strongly from end to end. Wax the end of the snell thoroughly for two or  three inches, and wax the tapers of two strong Sproat or O'Shaughnessy  hooks, and wind the lower hook on with strong, waxed silk, to the end of  the taper; then lay the second hook at right angles with the first, and  one inch above it; wind this as the other, and then fasten a third and  smaller hook above that for a lip hook. This gives the snell about one  foot in length, with the two lower hooks standing at right angles, one  above the other, and a third and smaller hook in line with the second.    The bait is the element of success; it is made as follows: Slice off a  clean, white pork rind, four or five inches long by an inch and a half  wide; lay it on a board, and, with a sharp knife cut it as nearly to the  shape of a frog as your ingenuity permits. Prick a slight gash in the  head to admit the lip hook, which should be an inch and a half above the  second one, and see that the fork of the bait rests securely in the barb  of the middle hook.    Use a stout bait-rod and a strong line. Fish from a boat, with a second  man to handle the oars, if convenient. Let the oarsman lay the boat ten  feet inside the edge of the lily-pads, and make your cast, say, with  thirty feet of line; land the bait neatly to the right, at the edge of  the lily-pads, let it sink a few inches, and then with the tip well  lowered, bring the bait around on a slight curve by a quick succession  of draws, with a momentary pause between each; the object being to  imitate as nearly as possible a swimming frog. If this be neatly done,  and if the bait be made as it should be, at every short halt the legs  will spread naturally, and the imitation is perfect enough to deceive  the most experienced bass or pickerel. When half a dozen casts to right  and left have been made without success, it is best to move on, still  keeping inside and casting outside the lily-pads.    A pickerel of three pounds or more will take in all three hooks at the  first snap; and, as he closes his mouth tightly and starts for the  bottom, strike quickly, but not too hard, and let the boatman put you  out into deep water at once, where you are safe from the strong roots of  the yellow lily.    It is logically certain your fish is well hooked. You cannot pull two  strong, sharp hooks through that tightly closed mouth without fastening  at least one of them where it will do most good. Oftener both will  catch, and it frequently happens that one hook will catch each lip,  holding the mouth nearly closed, and shortening the struggles of a large  fish very materially. On taking off a fish, and before casting again,  see that the two lower hooks stand at right angles. If they have got  turned in the struggle you can turn them at any angle you like; the  twisted wire is stiff enough to hold them in place. Every angler knows  the bold, determined manner in which the mascalonge strikes his prey. He  will take in bait and hooks at the first dash, and if the rod be held  stiffly usually hooks himself. Barring large trout, he is the king of  game fish. The big-mouthed bass is less savage in his attacks, but is a  free biter. He is apt to come up behind and seize the bait about  two-thirds of its length, turn, and bore down for the bottom. He will  mostly take in the lower hooks, however, and is certain to get fastened.  His large mouth is excellent for retaining the hook.    As for the small-mouthed (_Micropterus dolomieu_, if you want to be  scientific), I have found him more capricious than any game fish on the  list. One day he will take only dobsons, or crawfish; the next, he may  prefer minnows, and again, he will rise to the fly or a bucktail  spinner.    On the whole, I have found the pork frog the most successful lure in his  case; but the hooks and bait must be arranged differently. Three strands  of fine wire will make a snell strong enough, and the hooks should be  strong, sharp and rather small, the lower hooks placed only half an inch  apart, and a small lip hook two and a quarter inches above the middle  one. As the fork of the bait will not reach the bend of the middle hook,  it must be fastened to the snell by a few stitches taken with stout  thread, and the lower end of the bait should not reach more than a  quarter of an inch beyond the bottom of the hook, because the  small-mouth has a villainous trick of giving his prey a stern chase,  nipping constantly and viciously at the tail, and the above arrangement  will be apt to hook him at the first snap. Owing to this trait, some  artificial minnows with one or two hooks at the caudal end, are very  killing--when he will take them.    [Sidenote: Lake Trout]    Lake, or salmon trout, may be trolled for successfully with the above  lure; but I do not much affect fishing for them. Excellent sport may be  had with them, however, early in the season, when they are working near  the shore, but they soon retire to water from fifty to seventy feet  deep, and can only be caught by deep trolling or buoy-fishing. I have no  fancy for sitting in a slow-moving boat for hours,"]]]
