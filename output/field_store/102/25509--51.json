Spontaneous motion, growth, nutrition, separation  of parts, and generation are phenomena which indicate the presence of  life; which most certainly is not co-extensive with matter. So  Hylozoism, ancient and modern, under whatever name you please to term  it, _breaks down_. Here, also, we discover that it is foolishness to  confound the terms _life_ and _force_.          MACAULAY ON SUNDAY.      * * * This day is not lost. While the machinery is stopped, while the  car rests on the road, while the treasury is silent, while the smoke  ceases to rise from the chimney of the factory, the nation enriches  itself none the less than during the working days of the week. Man, the  machine of all machines, * * * is recuperating and gathering strength as  well, that on Monday he returns to his work with his mind clearer, and  more courage for his work, and with renewed vigor.          THE ENTERPRISE.      The Christian Foundation is approaching the close of its first year, and  I think it proper now to return my heart-felt gratitude to those who  have given strength to it in its youth, when strength was and is most  needed. I do not claim that it is perfect or faultless, but I am glad to  know that its reputation has been and is all that I can ask, viewing it  in the light of my own limited intelligence. I have been and am  endeavoring to make this journal food for the intellect. I have the  consolation, whether it lives long or short, of knowing that I have  given it my best energies and attention. And I have refrained from  loading it with advertisements, simply for profits. I shall continue it  if permitted by Providence. And as the year is drawing to a close, I  wish to say to all its patrons, can you not remain with this journal at  least through another year, and by so doing assist me in placing one  matter of fact, biblical and scientific, as well as logical defense of  our religion, upon a solid basis. It will continue to know no party or  sect, and it will continue to defend the truth wherever found. \"Truth  stands true to her God; man alone vacillates.\"          NAPOLEON BONAPARTE'S ESTIMATE OF THE CHRIST.      Napoleon said, \"I know men, and I tell you that Jesus Christ is not a  man. Superficial minds see resemblance between Christ and the founders  of empires and the gods of other religions; that resemblance does not  exist. There is between Christianity and whatever other religion the  distance of infinity. As for me, I recognize the gods and these great  men as beings like myself. Nothing announces them as divine. It is not  so with Christ. Everything in him astonishes me; between him and whoever  else in the world there is no term of comparison. He is truly a being by  himself. In fact, the sciences and philosophy avail nothing for  salvation, and Jesus came into the world to reveal the mysteries of  Heaven and the laws of the spirit; also he has nothing to do but with  the soul, and to that alone he brings his gospel. * * * Jesus borrowed  nothing from our sciences. He is not a philosopher, since he advances by  miracles, and from the commencement his disciples worshipped him.    \"The Bible contains a complete series of facts of historical men, to  explain time and eternity, such as no other religion has to offer. Even  the impious themselves have never dared to deny the sublimity of the  gospel. * * * In every other existence but that of Christ how many  imperfections! * * Christ proved that he was the son of the Eternal by  his disregard of time. All his doctrines signify one only and the same  thing--_eternity_.\"          OBITUARY.      \"LITTLE MYRTIE\" BOGG, daughter of Dr. M.M. and Mary A. Bogg, of Macy,  Indiana, departed this life on the 6th day of October, 1880. Aged two  years, 7 months and 28 days. She leaves along with her parents three  lovely sisters. One great consolation to parents and sisters is in the  fact that \"Little Myrtie\" bore her afflictions with the fortitude and  patience of _even true womanhood_, but best of all was the good  Christian sense and rare intelligence that she exhibited in her last  hours. Let her last words, \"By, by,\" and \"come and see Myrtie,\" burn  upon the altar of the heart until we all meet her in the better land.

They seem to say to us  Christians, Hear us, ye hard-thinking toilers and aspirants to the  realms of bliss while we proclaim to you the perils of our position; we  warn you against the crime of accustoming yourselves to the  investigation of the political and civil interests of the day, and let  not your devout meditations be disturbed by secular pursuits. Read your  Bibles and other pious books; attend to all your prayer meetings and all  your philanthropic societies.    What is the object of all this pious policy? Is it to keep the national  mind as far as possible in a state of political stagnation, or,  otherwise, to ostracise politically the preachers of the land with  reference to party success? How is this? Are the preachers of the United  States a dangerous element in our land? If they are, then the fewer we  have of them the better we are off. Do any but infidels take that view  of the subject? It correllates with infidelity, but not with  Christianity.          TO KEEP A ROOM PURE.      To keep a room purified it is only necessary to keep a pitcher or some  other vessel full of water in it. The water will absorb all the respired  gases. The colder the water is the greater is its capacity to hold the  gases. At ordinary temperature a pail of water will absorb a pint of  carbonic acid gas and several pints of ammonia. The capacity is nearly  doubled by reducing the water to the temperature of ice. Water kept  awhile in a room is unfit for use. The pump should always be emptied  before catching water for use. Impure water is more injurious than  impure air.          *      *      *      *      *    Man, being essentially active, must find in activity his joy, as well as  his beauty and glory, and labor, like everything else that is good, is  its own reward.
