And yet so blind is love  that defects often seem to be virtues, deformity assumes the style of  beauty, and even hideous vices have appeared under an attractive form.    In Shakespeare's play Cleopatra speaks of an old attachment which she  had lived to despise as having arisen in her \"salad days,\" when she was  green in judgment. In extreme youth love is especially blind, and for  this, as well as for other reasons, girls, who are yet at school, do not  consult their best interests when they allow love to occupy their too  youthful minds. It prevents the enjoyment of happy years of maidenhood,  and sometimes leads to marriage before the girl is fit, either  physically, mentally, or domestically, for the cares of married life.    \"I believe,\" says R. W. Dale, of Birmingham, \"in falling in love. The  imagination should be kindled and the heart touched; there should be  enthusiasm and even romance in the happy months that precede marriage,  and something of the enthusiasm and romance should remain to the very  end of life, or else the home is wanting in its perfect happiness and  grace. But take my word for it, solid virtues are indispensable to the  security and happiness of a home.\"    You would not like to live with a liar, with a thief, with a drunkard,  for twenty or thirty years. A lazy man will make but a weak band or  support for his and your house; so will one deficient in fortitude--that  is, the power to bear pain and trouble without whining. Beware of the  selfish man, for though he may be drawn out of selfishness in the early  weeks of courtship, he will settle back into it again when the wear and  worry of life come on. And remember that a man may have the roots of  some of these vices in him and yet be extremely agreeable and  good-looking, dress well, and say very pretty and charming things. \"How  easy is it for the proper-false in women's waxen hearts to set their  forms!\"    In their haste to be married many women are too easily satisfied with  the characters of men who may offer themselves as husbands. They aim at  matrimony in the abstract; not _the_ man, but any man. They would not  engage a servant if all they knew of her were that she had, as a  housemaid lately advertised, \"a fortnight's character from her last  place;\" but with even less information as to their characters they will  accept husbands and vow to love, honour, and obey them! In comparison  how much more honourable and how much less unloved and unloving is the  spinster's lot! Women marry simply for a home because they have not been  trained to fight the battle of life for themselves, and because their  lives are so dull and stagnant that they think any change must be for  the better.    A friend--let us say Barlow--was describing to Jerrold the story of his  courtship and marriage: how his wife had been brought up in a convent,  and was on the point of taking the veil, when his presence burst upon  her enraptured sight. Jerrold listened to the end of the story, and by  way of comment said, \"Ah! she evidently thought Barlow better than nun.\"  When girls have been given work in the world they do not think that any  husband is better than none, and they have not time to imagine  themselves in love with the first man who proposes. How often is it the  case that people think themselves in love when in fact they are only  idle!    There are hearts all the better for keeping; they become mellower and  more worth a woman's acceptance than the crude, unripe things that are  sometimes gathered--as children gather green fruit--to the discomfort of  those who obtain them. A husband may be too young to properly appreciate  and take care of a wife. And yet perhaps the majority of girls would  rather be a young man's slave than an old man's darling. \"My dear,\" said  a father to his daughter, \"I intend that you should be married, but not  that you should throw yourself away on any wild, worthless boy: you must  marry a man of sober and mature age. What do you think of a fine,  intelligent husband of fifty?\" \"I think two of twenty-five would be  better, papa.\"    Prophecies as to the probable result of a marriage are as a rule little  to be trusted. It was so in the case of the celebrated Madame Necker.  She had been taken to Paris to live with a young widow, to whom  Necker--a financier from Geneva--came to pay his addresses. The story  goes that the widow, in order to rid herself of her admirer, got him to  transfer his addresses to her young companion, saying to herself, \"they  will bore each other to death, that will give them something to do.\" The  happy pair, however, had no such foreboding. \"I am marrying a man,\"  wrote the lady, \"whom I should believe to be an angel, if his great love  for me did not show his weakness.\" In his way the husband was equally  satisfied. \"I account myself as happy as it is possible for a man to  be,\" he wrote to a mutual friend; and to the end of the chapter there  was no flaw in that matrimonial life.    Never to marry a genius was the advice of Mrs. Carlyle. \"I married for  ambition. Carlyle has exceeded all that my wildest hopes ever imagined  of him, and I am miserable.\" As the supply of geniuses is very limited,  this advice may seem superfluous. It is not so, however, for there is  enough and to spare of men who think that they are geniuses, and take  liberties accordingly. These are very often only sons of fond but  foolish mothers, who have persuaded them that they are not made of  common clay, and that the girls who get them will be blessed. From such  a blessing young women should pray to be delivered.    Perhaps it may be said that though it is easy to write about choosing a  husband, for the majority of English girls, at least, there is but  little choice in the matter. Dickens certainly told an American  story--very American--of a young lady on a voyage, who, being intensely  loved by five young men, was advised to \"jump overboard and marry the  man who jumped in after her.\" Accordingly, next morning the five lovers  being on deck, and looking very devotedly at the young lady, she plunged  into the sea. Four of the lovers immediately jumped in after her. When  the young lady and four lovers were out again, she said to the captain,  \"What am I to do with them now, they are so wet?\" \"Take the dry one.\"  And the young lady did, and married him. How different is the state of  affairs on this side of the Atlantic, where, if a young woman is to be  married, she must take not whom she will, but whom she can. \"Oh me, the  word choose! I may neither choose whom I would, nor refuse whom I  dislike.\" But is it necessary to marry? Far better to have no husband  than a bad one.    There is a great deal of human nature in the account which Artemus Ward  gives of the many affecting ties which made him hanker after Betsy Jane.  \"Her father's farm jined our'n; their cows and our'n squencht their  thurst at the same spring; our old mares both had stars in their  forrerds; the measles broke out in both famerlies at nearly the same  period; our parients (Betsy's and mine) slept reglarly every Sunday in  the same meetin-house, and the nabers used to obsarve, 'How thick the  Wards and Peasleys air!' It was a surblime site, in the spring of the  year, to see our sevral mothers (Betsy's and mine) with their gowns  pin'd up so thay couldn't sile 'em affecshunitly bilin sope together and  aboozin the nabers.\"    In this matter more than in most others \"we do not will according to our  reason, we reason according to our will.\" True desire, the monition of  nature, is much to be attended to. But always we are to discriminate  carefully between _true_ desire and false. The medical men tell us we  should eat what we _truly_ have an appetite for; but what we only  _falsely_ have an appetite for we should resolutely avoid. Ought not  choice in matrimony to be guided by the same principle?    Above all things young ladies should ask God, the best maker of  marriages, to direct their choice aright.          CHAPTER VI.    ON MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD MATRIMONIAL BARGAIN.      \"How poor are they who have not patience!    What wound did ever heal, but by degrees?\"--_Shakespeare._      \"E'en now, in passing through the garden walks,    Upon the ground I saw a fallen nest,    Ruined and full of ruin; and over it,    Behold, the uncomplaining birds, already    Busy in building a new habitation.\"--_Longfellow._      But \"the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft a-gley.\" We are none  of us infallible, \"not even the youngest.\" When the greatest care has  been taken in choosing, people get bad matrimonial bargains. From the  nature of the case this must often happen. If not one man in a thousand  is a judge of the points of a horse, not one in a million understands  human nature. And even if a young man or woman did understand human  nature, there are before marriage, as a rule, opportunities of gaining  only the slightest knowledge of the character of one who is to be the  weal or woe of a new home. It is related in ancient history, or fable,  that when Rhodope, a fashionable Egyptian beauty, was engaged bathing,  an eagle stole away one of her shoes, and let it fall near Psammetichus  the king. Struck with the pretty shoe, he fell in love with the foot,  and finally married the owner of both. Very little more acquaintance  with each other have the majority of the Innocents who go abroad into  the unknown country of Matrimony to seek their fortunes or misfortunes.    And then the temper and manner of people when making love are so  different from what these become afterwards! \"One would think the whole  endeavour of both parties during the time of courtship is to hinder  themselves from being known--to disguise their natural "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#9)"],[1," rises you must  prophesy that it will fall again, else assuredly you will be drowned.\"    Whereupon the people settled down again in their homes and waited for  the river to drown the prophet and prove his words. But the river at  this season of the year was steadily falling, and the prophet, like many  another, was without honour in his own country.    Sanders went away; and, although somewhat discouraged, Mr. Torrington  resumed his experiments. First of all, he took up sleeping sickness, and  put in three months' futile work, impressing nobody save a gentleman of  whom more must be written in a further chapter. Then he dropped that  study suddenly and went to another.    He had ideas concerning vaccination, but the first baby he vaccinated  died of croup, and Torrington came flying down the river telling Sanders  a rambling story of a populace infuriated and demanding his blood. Then  Torrington went home.    \"The country is now quiet,\" wrote Sanders to the Administrator, with  sardonic humour. \"There are numerous palavers pending, but none of any  particular moment. The Isisi people are unusually quiet, and Bosambo,  the Monrovian, of whom I have written your Excellency, makes a model  chief for the Ochori. No thefts have been traced to him for three  months. I should be grateful if full information could be supplied to me  concerning an expedition which at the moment is traversing this country  under the style of the Isisi Exploitation Syndicate.\"    Curiously enough, Torrington had forgotten the fact that a member of  this expedition had been one of the most interested students of his  sleeping sickness clinics.    The Isisi Exploitation Syndicate, Limited, was born between the entre  and the sweet at the house of a gentleman whose Christian name was  Isidore, and who lived in Maida Vale. At dinner one night with a dear  friend--who called himself McPherson every day of the year except on Yum  Kippur, when he frankly admitted that he had been born Isaacs--the  question of good company titles came up, and Mr. McPherson said he had  had the \"Isisi Exploitation\" in his mind for many years. With the aid of  an atlas the Isisi country was discovered. It was one of those atlases  on which are inscribed the staple products of the lands, and across the  Isisi was writ fair \"Rubber,\" \"Kola-nut,\" \"Mahogany,\" and \"Tobacco.\"    I would ask the reader to particularly remember \"Tobacco.\"    \"There's a chief I've had some correspondence with,\" said Mr. McPherson,  chewing his cigar meditatively; \"we could get a sort of concession from  him. It would have to be done on the quiet, because the country is a  British Protectorate. Now, if we could get a man who'd put up the stuff,  and send him out to fix the concession, we'd have a company floated  before you could say knife.\"    Judicious inquiry discovered the man in Claude Hyall Cuthbert, a  plutocratic young gentleman, who, on the strength of once having nearly  shot a lion in Uganda, was accepted by a large circle of acquaintances  as an authority on Africa.    Cuthbert, who dabbled in stocks and shares, was an acquisition to any  syndicate, and on the understanding that part of his duty would be the  obtaining of the concession, he gladly financed the syndicate to the  extent of seven thousand pounds, four thousand of which Messrs. Isidore  and McPherson very kindly returned to him to cover the cost of his  expedition.    The other three thousand were earmarked for office expenses.    As Mr. McPherson truly said:    \"Whatever happens, we're on velvet, my boy,\" which was perfectly true.    Before Cuthbert sailed, McPherson offered him a little advice.    \"Whatever you do,\" he said, \"steer clear of that dam' Commissioner  Sanders. He's one of those pryin', interferin'----\"    \"I know the breed,\" said Cuthbert wisely. \"This is not my first visit to  Africa. Did I ever tell you about the lion I shot in Uganda?\"    A week later he sailed.           *     *     *     *     *    In course of time came a strange white man through Sanders' domain. This  white man, who was Cuthbert, was following the green path to death--but  this he did not know. He threw his face to the forest, as the natives  say, and laughed, and the people of the village of O'Tembi, standing  before their wattle huts, watched him in silent wonder.    It was a wide path between huge trees, and the green of the undergrowth  was flecked with sunlight, and, indeed, the green path was beautiful to  the eye, being not unlike a parkland avenue.    N'Beki, chief of this village of the O'Tembi, a very good old man, went  out to the path when the white man began his journey.    \"White man,\" he said solemnly, \"this is the road to hell, where all  manner of devils live. Night brings remorse, and dawn brings  self-hatred, which is worse than death.\"    Cuthbert, whose Swaheli was faulty, and whose Bomongo talk was nil,  grinned impatiently as his coastboy translated unpicturesquely.    \"Dam nigger done say, this be bad place, no good; he say bimeby you libe  for die.\"    \"Tell him to go to blazes!\" said Cuthbert noisily; \"and, look here,  Flagstaff, ask him where the rubber is, see? Tell him we know all about  the forest, and ask him about the elephants, where their playground is?\"    Cuthbert was broad-shouldered and heavily built, and under his broad  sun-helmet his face was very hot and moist.    \"Tell the white man,\" said the chief quietly, \"there is no rubber within  seven days' journey, and that we do not know ivory; elephants there were  _cala cala_--but not now.\"    \"He's a liar!\" was Cuthbert's only comment. \"Get these beggars moving,  Flagstaff. Hi, _alapa', avanti, trek_!\"    \"These beggars,\" a straggling line of them, resumed their loads  uncomplainingly. They were good carriers, as carriers go, and only two  had died since the march began.    Cuthbert stood and watched them pass, using his stick dispassionately  upon the laggards. Then he turned to go.    \"Ask him,\" he said finally, \"why he calls this the road to  what-d'ye-call-it?\"    The old man shook his head.    \"Because of the devils,\" he said simply.    \"Tell him he's a silly ass!\" bellowed Cuthbert and followed his  carriers.    This natural path the caravan took extended in almost a straight line  through the forest. It was a strange path because of its very  smoothness, and the only drawback lay in the fact that it seemed to be  the breeding-place of flies--little black flies, as big as the house-fly  of familiar shape, if anything a little bigger.    They terrified the natives for many reasons, but principally because  they stung. They did not terrify Cuthbert, because he was dressed in  tapai cloth; none the less, there were times when these black flies  found joints in his armour and roused him to anger. This path extended  ten miles and made pleasant travelling. Then the explorer struck off  into the forest, following another path, well beaten, but more  difficult.    By devious routes Mr. Cuthbert came into the heart of Sanders'  territories, and he was successful in this, that he avoided Sanders. He  had with him a caravan of sixty men and an interpreter, and in due  course he reached his objective, which was the village of a great chief  ruling a remarkable province--Bosambo, of the Ochori, no less; sometime  Krooman, steward of the Elder Dempster line, chief on sufferance, but  none the less an interesting person. Bosambo, you may be sure, came out  to greet his visitor.    \"Say to him,\" said Cuthbert to his interpreter, \"that I am proud to meet  the great chief.\"    \"Lord chief,\" said the interpreter in the vernacular, \"this white man is  a fool, and has much money.\"    \"So I see,\" said Bosambo.    \"Tell him,\" said Cuthbert, with all the dignity of an ambassador, \"that  I have come to bring him wonderful presents.\"    \"The white man says,\" said the interpreter, \"that if he is sure you are  a good man he will give you presents. Now,\" said the interpreter  carefully, \"as I am the only man who can speak for you, let us make  arrangements. You shall give me one-third of all he offers. Then will I  persuade him to continue giving, since he is the father of mad people.\"    \"And you,\" said Bosambo briefly, \"are the father of liars.\"    He made a sign to his guard, and they seized upon the unfortunate  interpreter and led him forth. Cuthbert, in a sweat of fear, pulled a  revolver.    \"Master,\" said Bosambo loftily, \"you no make um fuss. Dis dam' nigger,  he no good; he make you speak bad t'ings. I speak um English proper. You  sit down, we talk um.\"    So Cuthbert sat down in the village of Ochori, and for three days there  was a great giving of presents, and signing of concessions. Bosambo  conceded the Ochori country--that was a small thing. He granted forest  rights of the Isisi, he sold the Akasava, he bartered away the Lulungo  territories and the \"native products thereof\"--I quote from the written  document now preserved at the Colonial Office and bearing the scrawled  signature of Bosambo--and he added, as a lordly afterthought, the Ikeli  district.    \"What about river rights?\" asked the delighted Cuthbert.    \"What will you give um?\" demanded Bosambo cautiously.    \"Forty English pounds?\" suggested Cuthbert.    \"I take um,\" said Bosambo.    It was a remarkably simple business; a more knowledgeable man than  Cuthbert would have been scared by the easiness of his success, but  Cuthbert was too satisfied with himself to be scared at anything.    It is said that his leave-taking with Bosambo was of an affecting  character, that Bosambo wept and embraced his benefactor's feet.    Be that as it may, his \"concessions\" in his pocket, Cuthbert began his  coastward journey, still avoiding Sanders.    He came to Etebi and found a deputy-commissioner, who received him with  open arms. Here Cuthbert stayed a week.    Mr. Torrington at the time was tremendously busy with a scheme for  stamping out sleeping sickness. Until then, Cuthbert was"]]]
