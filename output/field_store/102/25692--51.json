The sagebrush extends approximately 200  feet in all directions from the station (Fig. 5). Pinyon pine and Utah  juniper trees are encroaching upon this area, and scattered trees are  present throughout the sagebrush. This area is one of the habitats of  _P. maniculatus_.    Sagebrush tends to provide less shade for the ground than pinyon-juniper  woodland, and therefore the surface temperatures of the soil rise  rapidly to their daily maximum. In mid-June, air temperatures rise  rapidly from 6 A. M. until they reach the daily maximum between 2 and 4  P. M. Shortly after 4 P. M. the air temperatures decrease rapidly and  reach the daily low by about 5 A. M.    Relative humidities follow an inverse relationship to air temperatures;  when air temperatures are highest, relative humidities approach their  lowest values. Thus, on clear days, humidities decrease during the day,  reaching a minimum slightly later than air temperatures attain their  maximum. Unless it rains, the highest humidities of the day occur  between midnight and 6 A. M.      _Drainage Site, 7,625 feet elevation_    This site was in the bottom of the drainage that runs through the  eastern side of the trapping grid, and through parts of units M, N, I,  and J. The site was at station M4d on a level bench at the head of the  drainage (Fig. 11). Southward from the station the drainage deepens  rapidly, and the bottom loses approximately 25 feet in elevation for  every 200 feet of linear distance. _P. maniculatus_ lives here.    The microclimate of the drainage differs markedly from that of other  stations. The major difference is attributable to the topography of the  drainage itself. Nocturnal cold air flows from the surrounding mesa top  to lower elevations. A lake of cold air forms in the bottom of the  drainage; the depth of the lake depends in part upon the depth of the  drainage. The same phenomenon occurs in canyons and causes cooler night  time temperatures on the floor of canyons than on adjacent mesa tops  (Erdman, Douglas, and Marr, in press). Drainage of cold air into lower  elevations affects both nocturnal air temperatures and relative  humidities. Table 4 shows that maximum air temperatures in the drainage  did not differ appreciably from those at other stations. Mean minimum  temperatures, however, were considerably lower in the drainage than at  the other sites. This phenomenon is reflected also in the mean air  temperatures at this station.        [Illustration: FIG. 10: (above) Photograph of microclimatic station         at the Far View Sagebrush Site, at trapping station F4a in the         grid south of Far View Ruins. Dominant vegetation is _Artemisia         tridentata_.]        [Illustration: FIG. 11: (below) Photograph of microclimatic station         at the Drainage Site, in the bottom of a shallow drainage at         trapping station M4d of the grid south of Far View Ruins.]    The drainage site had the highest humidities of all stations each month  in which data were collected (Table 4). Relative humidities of 90 to 100  per cent were common in the drainage, but occurred at other stations  only in rainy periods. For example, in the month of August, 26 of the  daily maximum readings were between 95 and 100 per cent at the drainage  site, but at the other stations relative humidities were above 95 per  cent for an average of only nine nights. Minimum humidities were about  the same for all stations, since they are affected by insolation  received during the day, and not by the drainage of cold air at night.      _Oak Brush Site, 7,640 feet elevation_    The station was in an oak thicket at trapping station L4a, 250 feet  south and 50 feet east of the drainage site on a southwest-facing slope  of about 30 degrees (Fig. 12). The station was on the lower third of the  slope, approximately 15 feet higher than M4d, the station in the bottom  of the drainage. _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_ occur together in this  area.    Air temperatures and relative humidities at this station did not differ  appreciably from mean temperatures and humidities at the other stations.  The unusual feature is the lack of evidence of cold air drainage. The  lake of cold air in the bottom of the drainage apparently is too shallow  to reach this station. This site is near the head of the drainage, and  the cold, nocturnal air probably moves rapidly down slope into the  deeper parts of the canyon, rather than piling up at the shallow head of  the drainage.    In spite of the shade afforded the ground by the oak brush, temperatures  reached the same maximum values as at the drainage site, owing to the  orientation of the slope. South-facing slopes receive more direct  insolation throughout the day and throughout the year than north-facing  slopes and mesa tops (Geiger, 1965:374). In Mesa Verde, south-facing  slopes tend to be more arid; snow melts rapidly, and most of this  moisture evaporates. As a consequence, south-facing slopes have less  soil moisture and more widely-distributed vegetation than north-facing  slopes where snows often persist all winter and melt in spring. (For a  detailed discussion of climates on northeast-versus-southwest-facing  slopes in Mesa Verde, see Erdman, Douglas, and Marr, in press.)      _Pinyon-Juniper-Muttongrass Site, 7,600 feet elevation_    The station was in the trapping grid at D5b (Fig. 13). The  pinyon-juniper woodland surrounding this site resembles much of the  woodland on the middle part of the mesa. The forest floor is well shaded  by the coniferous canopy, and muttongrass is the dominant plant in the  ground cover. _P. truei_ lives in this habitat.    The climate at this site is moderate. Shade from the canopy greatly  moderates the maximum air temperatures during the day; minimum air  temperatures, however, are about the same as at the other stations  (Table 4). Mean temperatures are somewhat lower at this site than at the  others because of the lower maximum temperatures. Relative humidities do  not differ markedly from those at other stations.    Figure 14 shows hygrothermograph traces at all stations for a typical  week. An interesting phenomenon is illustrated by several of these  traces. By about midnight, air temperatures have cooled to within a few  degrees of their nightly low. At this time, heat is given up by the  surface of the ground in sufficient quantities to elevate the air  temperature at ground level. This release of reradiated energy lasts  from one to several hours, then air temperatures drop to the nightly low  just before sunrise. A depression in the percentage of relative humidity  accompanies this surge of warmer air. On some nights winds apparently  disturb, or mix, the layers of air at ground level. On such nights the  reradiation of energy is not apparent in the traces of the thermographs.  Reradiation of energy is restricted to ground level, and traces of  hygrothermographs in standard Weather Bureau shelters, approximately  four feet above the ground surface, at other sites on the mesa top did  not record it.        [Illustration: FIG. 12: (left) Photograph of microclimatic station         at the Oak Brush Site, at trapping station L4a of the grid south         of Far View Ruins.

Grass in the foreground is         muttongrass, _Poa fendleriana_.]    The instruments used in this study were unmodified Belfort  hygrothermographs containing as sensing units a hair element for  relative humidity and a Bourdon tube for air temperatures. The hair  element, especially, does not register changes in humidity at precisely  ground level; rather, it reflects changes in the layer of air from about  ground level to about a foot above. Thus data from these instruments  give only approximations of the conditions under which mice live while  they are on the ground.    Climatic conditions greatly influence trapping success. Larger numbers  of mice generally were caught on nights when humidities were higher than  average. Rain in part of the evening almost invariably resulted in more  mice of each species being caught. This was probably due to increased  metabolism, by the mice, to keep warm. Apparently the mice began  foraging as soon as the rains subsided; mice were always dry when caught  after a rain. Few mice were caught if rains continued throughout the  night and into the daylight hours.

For some time  his story obtained credit, but it proved to be altogether void of  foundation. These apparently cleared tracts were afterwards found to be  occasioned by unusual poverty of soil, and by being overrun with thick {25}  spongy moss, the vivid green colour of which produces, from a distance, an  appearance of most luxuriant pasture land. Sir John Narborough noticed, and  thus describes them: \"The wood shows in many places as if there were  plantations: for there were several clear places in the woods, and grass  growing like fenced fields in England, the woods being so even by the sides  of it.\"[18]    The wind, after leaving Freshwater Bay, increased, with strong squalls from  the S.W., at times blowing so hard as to lay the ship almost on her  broadside. It was, however, so much in our favour, that we reached the  entrance of Port Famine early, and after some little detention from  baffling winds, which always render the approach to that bay somewhat  difficult, the ships anchored in the harbour.           *       *       *       *       *      {26}    CHAPTER III.

In almost every account published of the Strait of Magalhaens, so much  notice has been taken of Port Famine, that I had long considered it a  suitable place for our purposes; and upon examination I found it offered so  many advantages, that I did not hesitate to make it our head-quarters. As  soon, therefore, as the ship was moored, tents were pitched, our  decked-boat was hoisted out and hauled on shore, to be coppered and  equipped for the survey;--and Captain Stokes received orders to prepare the  Beagle for examining the western part of the Strait; previous to which she  required to be partially refitted, and supplied with fuel and water.    For several days after our arrival, we had much rain and strong  south-westerly wind, with thick clouds, which concealed the high land to  the southward; allowing us only now and then a partial glimpse. One evening  (11th) the air was unusually clear, and many of the mountains in that  direction were distinctly defined. We had assembled to take leave of our  friends in the Beagle, and were watching the gradual appearance of  snow-capped mountains which had previously been concealed, when, bursting  upon our view, as if by magic, a lofty mountain appeared towering among  them; whose snowy mantle, strongly contrasted with the dark and threatening  aspect of the sky, much enhanced the grandeur of the scene.    [Illustration: THE HOPE, IN THE STRAIT OF MAGALHAENS.]    [Illustration: THE ADELAIDE, IN HUMMING BIRD COVE.]    [Illustration: P. P. King S. Bull    DISTANT VIEW OF MT. SARMIENTO.    Published by Henry Colburn, Great Marlborough Street, 1838]    {27} This mountain was the \"Snowy Volcano\" (_Volcan Nevado_) of Sarmiento,  with whose striking appearance that celebrated navigator seems to have been  particularly impressed, so minute and excellent is his description. It is  also mentioned in the account of Cordova's voyage.[19] The peculiar shape  of its summit as seen from the north would suggest the probability of its  being a volcano, but we never observed any indication of its activity. Its  volcanic form is perhaps accidental, for, seen from the westward, its  summit no longer resembles a crater. From the geological character of the  surrounding rocks its formation would seem to be of slate. It is in a range  of mountains rising generally two or three thousand feet above the sea; but  at the N.E. end of the range are some, at least four thousand feet high.  The height of the \"Snowy Volcano,\" or as we have called it, Mount  Sarmiento,[20] was found, by trigonometrical measurement, to be six  thousand eight hundred feet[21] above the level {28} of the sea. It is the  highest land that I have seen in Tierra del Fuego; and to us, indeed, it  was an object of considerable interest, because its appearance and  disappearance were seldom failing weather guides. In our Meteorological  Diary, a column was ruled for the insertion of its appearances.[22]    This clear state of the atmosphere was followed by a heavy fall of rain,  with northerly and easterly winds, which did not, however, last long.    In the vicinity of our tents erected on the low land, on the S.W. side of  the bay, were several ponds of water, perfectly fit for immediate use; but,  perhaps, too much impregnated with vegetable matter to keep good for any  length of time. Captain Stokes, therefore, filled his tanks from the river;  but as that water did not keep well, it was probably taken into the boat  too near the sea. This, however, was unavoidable, except by risking the  boats among a great number of sunken trees in the bed of the river.    The Beagle sailed on the 15th, to survey the western entrance of the  Strait, with orders to return to Port Famine by the end of March.    Our decked boat, the Hope, being ready, the command of her was given to Mr.  Wickham, who was in every way qualified for the trust. We were, however,  much mortified by finding that she leaked so considerably as to oblige us  to unload, and again haul her on shore. When ready for sea, she sailed  under the direction of my assistant-surveyor, Mr. Graves, to examine the  St. Sebastian channel and the deep opening to the S.E. of Cape Valentyn.  Her crew consisted of seven men, besides Mr. Wickham, and Mr. Rowlett, the  purser.    Having despatched the Beagle and the Hope, I was at leisure to carry on the  survey of the coast in the neighbourhood of Port Famine, and to make a plan  of the port itself. The {29} Transit, and Altitude circle, were set up; but  from the very unfavourable state of the weather, and the interference of  other occupations, I was only enabled to procure a series of zenith  distances of the sun, and stars, for the latitude.    Port Famine, a name well known to all who have interested themselves about  the Strait of Magalhaens, was selected by Sarmiento as the most convenient  place for the site of an establishment formed, at his suggestion, by Philip  II. King of Spain.    The voyage of Sir Francis Drake through the Strait into the Pacific, and  his successes against the Spanish colonies and trade on the western side of  the continent of America, induced the Viceroy of Lima to send an Expedition  to pursue the \"Corsair,\" with orders to fight and take him, dead or  alive.[23] This Expedition, commanded by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, who had  already been engaged twice with Drake, consisted of two ships, containing  in all two hundred armed men, sailors and soldiers; a force which was  considered sufficient to ensure the capture.[24]    The Strait of Magalhaens being the most likely place to meet with Drake,  Sarmiento was ordered to proceed through it, and take the opportunity of  exploring its coasts.    All this he performed in a manner highly creditable, as well for the  excellent description handed down in his unpretending journal, as for the  enterprising zeal, and steady perseverance, shown among difficulties of no  trifling nature. To his accounts of various places there will be frequent  occasion to refer. Our object, at present, is to give a short account of  the Colony.    Sarmiento sailed from Peru (1583), and entered the Strait from the Pacific.  After experiencing many serious difficulties, and escaping imminent  dangers, in the western part of the Strait, where the climate is so  rigorous and the country so desolate, it was not surprising that he should  become enraptured with the verdant, and picturesque appearance of the  shores to the eastward of Cape Froward, and with the open country in {30}  the neighbourhood, and to the northward of Cape Virgins.[25] After much  opposition from the Duke of Alva[26] and other powerful people, he  succeeded in convincing the King of the expediency of fortifying the shores  of the First Narrow, and forming several establishments within the Strait,  to prevent the passage of strange ships, to the prejudice of the King's  colonies in Chile and Peru; for at that time the passage round Cape Horn  was not known. Accordingly, an Expedition was prepared, consisting of  twenty-three vessels, under the joint command of Diego Florez de Valdez and  Sarmiento; the former being appointed Captain-general of the fleet, and of  the coast of Brazil; and the latter, Captain-general of the Strait of  Magalhaens, and Governor of all the Establishments that should be formed  within it.    Of the twenty-three ships which sailed from Spain, five only reached the  entrance of the Strait; and these, after experiencing many difficulties  from bad weather and foul winds, returned to Rio de Janeiro to refit, where  Sarmiento met four vessels which had been sent from Spain to his succour.  His colleague and General in chief, Florez, who had deserted the  Expedition, did all in his power to impede Sarmiento, to the latest moment  of his stay at the Brazils. At last, however, five ships, commanded by  Ribera, and manned by five hundred and thirty men,[27] sailed; and, without  encountering further loss or detention, arrived off the Strait in December  (1584), and soon after reached an anchorage, between the First and Second  Narrows.    Ribera would go no further; but landed about "]]]
