Before giving a description of the  resonator, it will be necessary to make a few introductory remarks on  certain laws of the philosophy of sound, which have been so clearly  demonstrated that they admit of no contradiction.    =Tone=, as we have seen, is the result of rapid periodic vibrations.    The =Loudness= of tone depends upon the _amplitude_ of the vibrations.  This is easily shown by drawing a bow over the string of a violin: while  the vibrations of the string are largest, the tone produced is loudest,  and as the vibrations get smaller, so the tone becomes fainter.    The =Pitch= of tone depends upon the _number_ of vibrations in a given  period of time. The greater the number of vibrations the higher the  pitch, and _vice versa_.    The =Quality= of tone depends on the _form_ of the vibrations, \"which also  determines the occurrence of upper partial tones.\"[K]    Now, to make the sound of any tone-producing element more intense, and  to give it some special quality, is the work of the resonator. If we  simply fix a fiddle string at either end, and, after giving it a certain  amount of tension, draw a bow across it, we shall certainly produce a  tone, but a very poor and faint one. Put the same string with the same  amount of tension upon a cheap violin, and the tone will be intensified,  and its quality changed, though that quality may be of a very unpleasant  kind. Repeat the experiment upon an Amati or a Straduarius, and not only  will the tone be more powerful still, but it will also have a full,  round, and beautiful quality. Something, it is true, depends upon the  string and upon the bowing, but we are here supposing the same string  and the same player, our object being to show how the _resonator_,  which, in this case, is the body of the violin, intensifies the tone of  the string, and affects its quality.    Illustrations exemplifying the same thing might be multiplied to any  extent, but the one I have just given will suffice. As with the string,  so with the vocal ligaments. Cut a larynx out of a dead body, put it in  proper position on the top of a bellows, and force the air through it,  and you will produce tone, but faint and poor tone. Now add a resonator  to the larynx, and the tone of the vocal ligaments will be intensified,  and its quality altered according to the kind of resonator you make use  of.    It is clear, therefore, that the human voice does not only depend upon  the vibrations of the vocal ligaments, and the corresponding vibrations  of the air passing between them, but also upon the resonator as defined  on p. 9. According to the natural formation of our resonator, and  according to the infinite variety of shapes which every one has it in  his power to give to it, our voices will be, always supposing the  conditions of the vocal ligaments to be the same, either full, round,  sonorous, and _beautiful_, or they will be poor, cutting, muffled,  guttural, nasal, and _ugly_.    As we have, or may easily acquire, absolute command over the resonator,  or, at least, over the greatest part of it, it is a comfort to know that  so very much depends upon it, and I trust my readers will now, with some  amount of pleasure, look with me at this part of the vocal apparatus.    The 1st and 2nd divisions of the resonator--namely, the pockets of the  larynx and the tube above the pocket ligaments--have been fully  described on pp. 52, 53, and no more need be said on the subject here.    The upper part of the throat, called in scientific works the \"Pharynx\"  (pl. I, P), is a cavity, the largest part of which may be seen through  the arch at the back of the open mouth. Its hinder wall is formed by the  spinal column, and it extends upwards as far as the Eustachian tubes  (pl. I, E) which communicate with the middle part of the ear. Here it  joins--    The =Cavities of the Nose= (pl. I, N), which have for their base the hard  and soft palate (pl. I, H and S), and which are divided by a bone  partition.    The only part of the =Mouth= which requires a particular description is  the soft palate. This is a movable partition by means of which either  the mouth or the nose can be completely separated from the throat. If  the nose is to be shut off from the throat the soft palate is _raised_,  and pressed against the back of the pharynx. If the mouth is to be shut  off the soft palate is _lowered_, and rests closely upon the back of the  tongue. This partition plays a most important part in vocalization. In  the formation of all pure vowel sounds it is _raised_, thereby closing  the nasal cavities, and it has been found that the closure is loosest  for \"ah\" (as in \"father\") and tightest for \"e\" (as in \"bee\"), the  intermediate vowels being \"a\" (as in \"name\"), \"oh\" and \"oo\" (as in  \"food\"). This has been clearly shown by Czermak in the following manner.  Lying down on his back, he had the nasal cavities filled with tepid  water. He then uttered the various vowel sounds, and ascertained from  the quantity of water required to force open the closure formed by the  soft palate the degree of tightness for each vowel. He afterwards  constructed a very ingenious little apparatus, by means of which, in one  of his lectures, he demonstrated this fact to his audience. It will be  easily understood from the above explanation that, if the closure of  the nasal cavities is sufficiently imperfect to allow any considerable  amount of air to pass through the nose, the result will be a nasal tone.         I am aware that the very opposite is taught by some. There are       those who maintain that nasal tone arises from the air _not_ being       able to get through the nose. I am even informed that in some parts       of England where nasal tone seems to be a general affliction, it is       the practice of teachers of singing to cause their pupils to bathe       their noses in hot water in order to relax the muscles which are       supposed by their contraction to produce nasal tone. I would,       however, in support of my statement, draw attention to the       following indisputable facts:--(1) It is quite possible to       completely close the nostrils, and yet to produce pure vocal tone.       (2) Persons who are either partly or entirely without the soft       palate can _under no circumstances_ utter a single sound without       the most pronounced nasal quality. It seems to me that these facts       sufficiently speak for themselves; but if any of my readers are not       convinced by them, let them try this experiment: Take a thin mirror       and hold it flat against the upper lip, with the glass upwards. Now       sing a pure vocal tone, and the mirror will remain perfectly       bright. Sing, on the contrary, with nasal quality, and the mirror       will at once be completely dimmed. This shows conclusively that       nasal sound is produced by singing _through_ the nose, and this       cannot be done without lowering the soft palate. Teachers of       singing know well enough that guttural tone is caused by the       obstinate arching up of the tongue, and if they understand their       business they eventually succeed in teaching a pupil labouring       under this disadvantage to get perfect control over his tongue. But       nobody thinks of the soft palate, though that can be brought under       subjection just as well as the tongue. Let singing masters see to       it, and young ladies will no longer be laughed at for having to       put their noses into hot water before charming their friends with       a song.    It now only remains to be added that the interior of the windpipe and of  the voicebox, as well as that of the throat, the mouth, and the nose, is  lined with a thin mucous membrane of a pinkish colour. This concludes my  description of the Vocal Organ as a musical instrument.          DIFFERENCES OF THE VOICEBOX, OR LARYNX, IN CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND MEN.      The voicebox of a newly-born baby is about one-third the size of that of  a grown woman. It is therefore rather large in proportion to other parts  of the body, with the exception of the head, which comparatively is  larger still. The horizontal outline of the shield cartilage is a very  gentle curve, and the upper horns are short, in consequence of which the  voicebox is close to the tongue. The wedges, according to Merkel, are  strongly developed; the vocal ligaments are short and thick, and the  pockets deep. Up to the third year the voicebox grows very considerably,  but no particular alterations take place from that time to the period of  puberty, which generally occurs at the age of 14 or 15, rather earlier  in girls than in boys. This period of change lasts from six to twelve  months, or sometimes even two or three years. During this time the vocal  organs undergo a marked change. In boys, the angle at which the two  plates of the shield meet becomes more and more acute, and the length of  the vocal ligaments increases only in the proportion of five to ten. In  girls, on the other hand, the horizontal outline of the shield does not  lose its evenness, and the length of the vocal ligaments increases only  in the proportion of five to seven. The cartilages would seem,  especially in boys, to grow more rapidly than the muscles, so that the  slowly-growing muscles do not, at first, control the newly-developed  cartilages. This accounts for the unmanageable state of the voice at  this period. The changes which take place in the female voicebox are  very imperceptible, so that they do not materially affect the character  of the voice. In the male voicebox, on the contrary, the alterations are  very marked, and the result is that the high voice of the boy is changed  into the tenor or the bass of the man. While, therefore, before the  period of puberty the voicebox is materially the same in both sexes,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#9)"],[1,"of the testator.        2.  Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, son of the above.        3.  Rupert Sent Leger, nephew of the testator.        4.  Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie, Bart., co-executor      with myself of the Will.        5.  Andrew Rossiter, my clerk, one of the witnesses of the testator's      Will.        6.  Alfred Nugent, stenographer (of Messrs. Castle's office, 21,      Bream's Buildings, W.C.).    When the Will had been read, Mr. E. H. Melton asked the value of the  estate left by the testator, which query I did not feel empowered or  otherwise able to answer; and a further query, as to why those present  were not shown the secret clauses of the Will.  I answered by reading the  instructions endorsed on the envelopes of the two letters marked \"B\" and  \"C,\" which were sufficiently explanatory.    But, lest any question should hereafter arise as to the fact that the  memoranda in letters marked \"B\" and \"C,\" which were to be read as clauses  10 and 11 of the Will, I caused Rupert Sent Leger to open the envelope  marked \"B\" in the presence of all in the room.  These all signed a paper  which I had already prepared, to the effect that they had seen the  envelope opened, and that the memorandum marked \"B.  To be read as clause  ten of my Will,\" was contained in the envelope, of which it was to be the  sole contents.  Mr. Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P., before signing,  carefully examined with a magnifying-glass, for which he had asked, both  the envelope and the heading of the memorandum enclosed in the letter.  He was about to turn the folded paper which was lying on the table over,  by which he might have been able to read the matter of the memorandum had  he so desired.  I at once advised him that the memorandum he was to sign  dealt only with the heading of the page, and not with the matter.  He  looked very angry, but said nothing, and after a second scrutiny signed.  I put the memorandum in an envelope, which we all signed across the flap.  Before signing, Mr Ernest Halbard Melton took out the paper and verified  it.  I then asked him to close it, which he did, and when the sealing-wax  was on it he sealed it with his own seal.  Sir Colin A. MacKelpie and I  also appended our own seals.  I put the envelope in another, which I  sealed with my own seal, and my co-executor and I signed it across the  flap and added the date.  I took charge of this.  When the others present  had taken their departure, my co-executor and I, together with Mr. Rupert  Sent Leger, who had remained at my request, went into my private room.    Here Mr. Rupert Sent Leger read the memorandum marked \"B,\" which is to be  read as clause 10 of the Will.  He is evidently a man of considerable  nerve, for his face was quite impassive as he read the document, which  conveyed to him (subject to the conditions laid down) a fortune which has  no equal in amount in Europe, even, so far as I know, amongst the crowned  heads.  When he had read it over a second time he stood up and said:    \"I wish I had known my uncle better.  He must have had the heart of a  king.  I never heard of such generosity as he has shown me.  Mr. Trent, I  see, from the conditions of this memorandum, or codicil, or whatever it  is, that I am to declare within a week as to whether I accept the  conditions imposed on me.  Now, I want you to tell me this: must I wait a  week to declare?\"  In answer, I told him that the testator's intention  was manifestly to see that he had full time to consider fully every point  before making formal decision and declaration.  But, in answer to the  specific question, I could answer that he might make declaration when he  would, provided it was _within_, or rather not after, the week named.  I  added:    \"But I strongly advise you not to act hurriedly.  So enormous a sum is  involved that you may be sure that all possible efforts will be made by  someone or other to dispossess you of your inheritance, and it will be  well that everything shall be done, not only in perfect order, but with  such manifest care and deliberation that there can be no question as to  your intention.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" he answered; \"I shall do as you shall kindly advise me  in this as in other things.  But I may tell you now--and you, too, my  dear Sir Colin--that I not only accept my Uncle Roger's conditions in  this, but that when the time comes in the other matters I shall accept  every condition that he had in his mind--and that I may know of--in  everything.\"  He looked exceedingly in earnest, and it gave me much  pleasure to see and hear him.  It was just what a young man should do who  had seen so generously treated.  As the time had now come, I gave him the  bulky letter addressed to him, marked \"D\" which I had in my safe.  As I  fulfilled my obligation in the matter, I said:    \"You need not read the letter here.  You can take it away with you, and  read it by yourself at leisure.  It is your own property, without any  obligation whatever attached to it.  By the way, perhaps it would be well  if you knew.  I have a copy sealed up in an envelope, and endorsed, 'To  be opened if occasion should arise,' but not otherwise.  Will you see me  to-morrow, or, better still, dine with me alone here to-night?  I should  like to have a talk with you, and you may wish to ask me some questions.\"  He answered me cordially.  I actually felt touched by the way he said  good-bye before he went away.

My Dear Nephew,        When (if ever) you receive this you will know that (with the      exception of some definite bequests) I have left to you, under      certain conditions, the entire bulk of my fortune--a fortune so great      that by its aid as a help, a man of courage and ability may carve out      for himself a name and place in history.  The specific conditions      contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I      deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my      advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my      wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you      may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry      them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for      may be ultimately achieved.  First let me explain--for your      understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had      better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune      has been ambition.  In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early      and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad      supervision, my ideas could be carried out by men whom I had selected      and tested, and not found wanting.  This was for years to the      satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of      fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their      importance to my designs.  Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a      young man, a considerable fortune.  This I have for over forty years      used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to      speculative investments.  With the latter I took such very great      care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that      even now my schedule of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is      almost a blank.  Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and      wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to      advantage.  This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I      was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself      opened up to me.  I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you      read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of      misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me.  My ventures in      commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of      the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas      were familiar to me.  In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I      was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native      richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  At last Chance took me      into that delectable region.  When the \"Balkan Struggle\" of '90 was      on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large      loan for national purposes.  It was known in financial circles of      both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the _haute      politique_ of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to      me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes.  After      confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in      the throes of a great crisis.  As you perhaps know, the gallant      little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange      history.  For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement      after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national      independence under several forms of Government.  At first it had a      King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned.      Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of      a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the      Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at      present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified"]]]
