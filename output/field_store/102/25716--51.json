[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/418"],[0,"A Treatise on Good Works (#9)"],[1,"\"Thou shalt not do whatsoever  is right in thine own eyes, but what thy God has commanded thee.\"    These and numberless like passages of Scripture are spoken to tear man  not only from sins, but also from the works which seem to men to be  good and right, and to turn men, with a single mind, to the simple  meaning of God's commandment only, that they shall diligently observe  this only and always, as it is written, Exodus xiii: \"These  commandments shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a  memorial between thine eyes.\" And Psalm i: \"A godly man meditates in  God's Law day and night.\" For we have more than enough and too much to  do, if we are to satisfy only God's commandments. He has given us such  commandments that if we understand them aright, we dare not for a  moment be idle, and might easily forget all other works. But the evil  spirit, who never rests, when he cannot lead us to the left into evil  works, fights on our right through self-devised works that seem good,  but against which God has commanded, Deuteronomy xxviii, and Joshua  xxiii, \"Ye shall not go aside from My commandments to the right hand or  to the left.\"    XXV. The third work of this Commandment is to call upon God's Name in  every need. For this God regards as keeping His Name holy and greatly  honoring it, if we name and call upon it in adversity and need. And  this is really why He sends us so much trouble, suffering, adversity  and even death, and lets us live in many wicked, sinful affections,  that He may thereby urge man and give him much reason to run to Him, to  cry aloud to Him, to call upon His holy Name, and thus to fulfil this  work of the Second Commandment, as He says in Psalm 1: \"Call upon Me in  the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me; for  I desire the sacrifice of praise.\" And this is the way whereby thou  canst come unto salvation; for through such works man perceives and  learns what God's Name is, how powerful it is to help all who call upon  it; and whereby confidence and faith grow mightily, and these are the  fulfilling of the first and highest Commandment.  This is the  experience of David, Psalm liv: \"Thou hast delivered me out of all  trouble, therefore will I praise Thy Name and confess that it is lovely  and sweet.\" And Psalm xci says, \"Because he hath set his hope upon Me,  therefore will I deliver him: I will help him, because he hath known My  Name.\"    Lo! what man is there on earth, who would not all his life long have  enough to do with this work? For who lives an hour without trials? I  will not mention the trials of adversity, which are innumerable. For  this is the most dangerous trial of all, when there is no trial and  every thing is and goes well; for then a man is tempted to forget God,  to become too bold and to misuse the times of prosperity. Yea, here he  has ten times more need to call upon God's Name than when in adversity.  Since it is written, Psalm xci, \"A thousand shall fall on the left hand  and ten thousand on the right hand.\"    So too we see in broad day, in all men's daily experience, that more  heinous sins and vice occur when there is peace, when all things are  cheap and there are good times, than when war, pestilence, sicknesses  and all manner of misfortune burden us; so that Moses also fears for  his people, lest they forsake God's commandment for no other reason  than because they are too full, too well provided for and have too much  peace, as he says, Deuteronomy xxxii \"My people is waxed rich, full and  fat; therefore has it forsaken its God.\" Wherefore also God let many of  its enemies remain and would not drive them out, in order that they  should not have peace and must exercise themselves in the keeping of  God's commandments, as it is written, Judges iii. So He deals with us  also, when He sends us all kinds of misfortune: so exceedingly careful  is He of us, that He may teach us and drive us to honor and call upon  His Name, to gain confidence and faith toward Him, and so to fulfil the  first two Commandments.    XXVI. Here foolish men run into danger, and especially the  work-righteous saints, and those who want to be more than others; they  teach men to make the sign of the cross; one arms himself with letters,  another runs to the fortunetellers; one seeks this, another that, if  only they may thereby escape misfortune and be secure. It is beyond  telling what a devilish allurement attaches to this trifling with  sorcery, conjuring and superstition, all of which is done only that men  may not need God's Name and put no trust in it. Here great dishonor is  done the Name of God and the first two Commandments, in that men look  to the devil, men or creatures for that which should be sought and  found in God alone, through naught but a pure faith and confidence, and  a cheerful meditation of and calling upon His holy Name.    Now examine this closely for yourself and see whether this is not a  gross, mad perversion: the devil, men and creatures they must believe,  and trust to them for the best; without such faith and confidence  nothing holds or helps. How shall the good and faithful God reward us  for not believing and trusting Him as much or more than man and the  devil, although He not only promises help and sure assistance, but also  commands us confidently to look for it, and gives and urges all manner  of reasons why we should place such faith and confidence in Him? Is it  not lamentable and pitiable that the devil or man, who commands nothing  and does not urge, but only promises, is set above God, Who promises,  urges and commands; and that more is thought of them than of God  Himself? We ought truly to be ashamed of ourselves and learn from the  example of those who trust the devil or men. For if the devil, who is a  wicked, lying spirit, keeps faith with all those who ally themselves  with him, how much more will not the most gracious, all-truthful God  keep faith, if a man trusts Him? Nay, is it not rather He alone Who  will keep faith?  A rich man trusts and relies upon his money and  possessions, and they help him; and we are not willing to trust and  rely upon the living God, that He is willing and able to help us? We  say: Gold makes bold; and it is true, as Baruch iii. says, \"Gold is a  thing wherein men trust.\" But far greater is the courage which the  highest eternal Good gives, wherein trust, not men, but only God's  children.    XXVII. Even if none of these adversities constrain us to call upon  God's Name and to trust Him, yet were sin alone more than sufficient to  train and to urge us on in this work. For sin has hemmed us in with  three strong, mighty armies. The first is our own flesh, the second the  world, the third the evil spirit, by which three we are without ceasing  oppressed and troubled; whereby God gives us occasion to do good works  without ceasing, namely, to fight with these enemies and sins. The  flesh seeks pleasure and peace, the world seeks riches, favor, power  and honor, the evil spirit seeks pride, glory, that a man be well  thought of, and other men be despised.    And these three are all so powerful that each one of them is alone  sufficient to fight a man, and yet there is no way we can overcome  them, except only by calling upon the holy Name of God in a firm faith,  as Solomon says, Proverbs xviii: \"The Name of the Lord is a strong  tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is set aloft.\" And David,  Psalm cxvi: \"I will drink the cup of salvation, and call upon the Name  of the Lord.\" Again, Psalm xviii: \"I will call upon the Lord with  praise: so shall I be saved from all mine enemies.\" These works and the  power of God's Name have become unknown to us, because we are not  accustomed to it, and have never seriously fought with sins, and have  not needed His Name, because we are trained only in our self devised  works, which we were able to do with our own powers.    XXVIII. Further works of this Commandment are: that we shall not swear,  curse, lie, deceive and conjure with the holy Name of God, and  otherwise misuse it; which are very simple matters and well known to  every one, being the sins which have been almost exclusively preached  and proclaimed under this Commandment. These also include, that we  shall prevent others from making sinful use of God's Name by lying,  swearing, deceiving, cursing, conjuring, and otherwise. Herein again  much occasion is given for doing good and warding off evil.    But the greatest and most difficult work of this Commandment is to  protect the holy Name of God against all who misuse it in a spiritual  manner, and to proclaim it to all men. For it is not enough that I, for  myself and in myself, praise and call upon God's Name in prosperity and  adversity. I must step forth and for the sake of God's honor and Name  bring upon myself the enmity of all men, as Christ said to His  disciples: \"Ye shall be hated of all men for My Name's sake.\" Here we  must provoke to anger father, mother, and the best of friends. Here we  must strive against spiritual and temporal powers, and be accused of  disobedience. Here we must stir up against us the rich, learned, holy,  and all that is of repute in the world. And although this is especially  the duty of those who are commanded to preach God's Word, yet every  Christian is also obligated to do so when time and place demand. For we  must for the holy Name of God risk and give up all that we have and can  do, and show by our deeds that we love God and His Name, His honor and  His praise above all things, and trust Him above all things, and expect  good from Him; thereby confessing that we regard Him as the highest  good, for the sake of which we let go and give up all other goods.    XXIX. Here we must first of all resist all wrong, where truth or  righteousness suffers violence or need, and dare make no distinction of  persons, as some do, who fight most actively and busily against the  wrong"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#9)"],[1,"shoes and stockings in the sun.    \"Are you sure he can't get away?\" she asked.    \"I'd bet a cookie on it,\" said Cap'n Bill, so Trot came ashore and took  off her shoes and stockings and laid them on the log to dry, while the  sailor-man resumed his work on the raft.    The Kalidah, realizing after many struggles that it could not escape,  now became quiet, but it said in a harsh, snarling voice:    \"I suppose you think you're clever, to pin me to the ground in this  manner.  But when my friends, the other Kalidahs, come here, they'll  tear you to pieces for treating me this way.\"    \"P'raps,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, coolly, as he chopped at the logs, \"an'  p'raps not.  When are your folks comin' here?\"    \"I don't know,\" admitted the Kalidah.  \"But when they DO come, you  can't escape them.\"    \"If they hold off long enough, I'll have my raft ready,\" said Cap'n  Bill.    \"What are you going to do with a raft?\" inquired the beast.    \"We're goin' over to that island, to get the Magic Flower.\"    The huge beast looked at him in surprise a moment, and then it began to  laugh.  The laugh was a good deal like a roar, and it had a cruel and  derisive sound, but it was a laugh nevertheless.    \"Good!\" said the Kalidah.  \"Good!  Very good!  I'm glad you're going to  get the Magic Flower.  But what will you do with it?\"    \"We're going to take it to Ozma, as a present on her birthday.\"    The Kalidah laughed again; then it became sober.  \"If you get to the  land on your raft before my people can catch you,\" it said, \"you will  be safe from us.  We can swim like ducks, so the girl couldn't have  escaped me by getting into the water; but Kalidahs don't go to that  island over there.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Trot.    The beast was silent.    \"Tell us the reason,\" urged Cap'n Bill.    \"Well, it's the Isle of the Magic Flower,\" answered the Kalidah, \"and  we don't care much for magic.  If you hadn't had a magic leg, instead  of a meat one, you couldn't have knocked me over so easily and stuck  this wooden pin through me.\"    \"I've been to the Magic Isle,\" said the Glass Cat, \"and I've watched  the Magic Flower bloom, and I'm sure it's too pretty to be left in that  lonely place where only beasts prowl around it and no else sees it.  So  we're going to take it away to the Emerald City.\"    \"I don't care,\" the beast replied in a surly tone.  \"We Kalidahs would  be just as contented if there wasn't a flower in our forest.  What good  are the things anyhow?\"    \"Don't you like pretty things?\" asked Trot.    \"No.\"    \"You ought to admire my pink brains, anyhow,\" declared the Glass Cat.  \"They're beautiful and you can see 'em work.\"    The beast only growled in reply, and Cap'n Bill, having now cut all his  logs to a proper size, began to roll them to the water's edge and  fasten them together.          10.  Stuck Fast      The day was nearly gone when, at last, the raft was ready.    \"It ain't so very big,\" said the old sailor, \"but I don't weigh much,  an' you, Trot, don't weigh half as much as I do, an' the glass pussy  don't count.\"    \"But it's safe, isn't it?\" inquired the girl.    \"Yes; it's good enough to carry us to the island an' back again, an'  that's about all we can expect of it.\"    Saying this, Cap'n Bill pushed the raft into the water, and when it was  afloat, stepped upon it and held out his hand to Trot, who quickly  followed him.  The Glass Cat boarded the raft last of all.    The sailor had cut a long pole, and had also whittled a flat paddle,  and with these he easily propelled the raft across the river.  As they  approached the island, the Wonderful Flower became more plainly  visible, and they quickly decided that the Glass Cat had not praised it  too highly.  The colors of the flowers that bloomed in quick succession  were strikingly bright and beautiful, and the shapes of the blossoms  were varied and curious.  Indeed, they did not resemble ordinary  flowers at all.    So intently did Trot and Cap'n Bill gaze upon the Golden Flower-pot  that held the Magic Flower that they scarcely noticed the island itself  until the raft beached upon its sands.  But then the girl exclaimed:  \"How funny it is, Cap'n Bill, that nothing else grows here excep' the  Magic Flower.\"    Then the sailor glanced at the island and saw that it was all bare  ground, without a weed, a stone or a blade of grass.  Trot, eager to  examine the Flower closer, sprang from the raft and ran up the bank  until she reached the Golden Flower-pot.  Then she stood beside it  motionless and filled with wonder.  Cap'n Bill joined her, coming more  leisurely, and he, too, stood in silent admiration for a time.    \"Ozma will like this,\" remarked the Glass Cat, sitting down to watch  the shifting hues of the flowers.  \"I'm sure she won't have as fine a  birthday present from anyone else.\"    \"Do you 'spose it's very heavy, Cap'n?  And can we get it home without  breaking it?\" asked Trot anxiously.    \"Well, I've lifted many bigger things than that,\" he replied; \"but  let's see what it weighs.\"    He tried to take a step forward, but could not lift his meat foot from  the ground.  His wooden leg seemed free enough, but the other would not  budge.    \"I seem stuck, Trot,\" he said, with a perplexed look at his foot.  \"It  ain't mud, an' it ain't glue, but somethin's holdin' me down.\"    The girl attempted to lift her own feet, to go nearer to her friend,  but the ground held them as fast as it held Cap'n Bill's foot.  She  tried to slide them, or to twist them around, but it was no use; she  could not move either foot a hair's breadth.    \"This is funny!\" she exclaimed. \"What do you 'spose has happened to us,  Cap'n Bill?\"    \"I'm tryin' to make out,\" he answered.  \"Take off your shoes, Trot.  P'raps it's the leather soles that's stuck to the ground.\"    She leaned down and unlaced her shoes, but found she could not pull her  feet out of them.  The Glass Cat, which was walking around as naturally  as ever, now said:    \"Your foot has got roots to it, Cap'n, and I can see the roots going  into the ground, where they spread out in all directions.  It's the  same way with Trot.  That's why you can't move.  The roots hold you  fast.\"    Cap'n Bill was rather fat and couldn't see his own feet very well, but  he squatted down and examined Trot's feet and decided that the Glass  Cat was right.    \"This is hard luck,\" he declared, in a voice that showed he was uneasy  at the discovery.  \"We're pris'ners, Trot, on this funny island, an'  I'd like to know how we're ever goin' to get loose, so's we can get  home again.\"    \"Now I know why the Kalidah laughed at us,\" said the girl, \"and why he  said none of the beasts ever came to this island.  The horrid creature  knew we'd be caught, and wouldn't warn us.\"    In the meantime, the Kalidah, although pinned fast to the earth by  Cap'n Bill's stake, was facing the island, and now the ugly expression  which passed over its face when it defied and sneered at Cap'n Bill and  Trot, had changed to one of amusement and curiosity.  When it saw the  adventurers had actually reached the island and were standing beside  the Magic Flower, it heaved a breath of satisfaction--a long, deep  breath that swelled its deep chest until the beast could feel the stake  that held him move a little, as if withdrawing itself from the ground.    \"Ah ha!\" murmured the Kalidah, \"a little more of this will set me free  and allow me to escape!\"    So he began breathing as hard as he could, puffing out his chest as  much as possible with each indrawing breath, and by doing this he  managed to raise the stake with each powerful breath, until at last the  Kalidah--using the muscles of his four legs as well as his deep  breaths--found itself free of the sandy soil.  The stake was sticking  right through him, however, so he found a rock deeply set in the bank  and pressed the sharp point of the stake upon the surface of this rock  until he had driven it clear through his body.  Then, by getting the  stake tangled among some thorny bushes, and wiggling his body, he  managed to draw it out altogether.    \"There!\" he exclaimed, \"except for those two holes in me, I'm as good  as ever; but I must admit that that old wooden-legged fellow saved both  himself and the girl by making me a prisoner.\"    Now the Kalidahs, although the most disagreeable creatures in the Land  of Oz, were nevertheless magical inhabitants of a magical Fairyland,  and in their natures a certain amount of good was mingled with the  evil.  This one was not very revengeful, and now that his late foes  were in danger of perishing, his anger against them faded away.    \"Our own Kalidah King,\" he reflected, \"has certain magical powers of  his own.  Perhaps he knows how to fill up these two holes in my body.\"    So without paying any more attention to Trot and Cap'n Bill than they  were paying to him, he entered the forest and trotted along a secret  path that led to the hidden lair of all the Kalidahs.    While the Kalidah was making good its escape Cap'n Bill took his pipe  from his pocket and filled it with tobacco and lighted it.  Then, as he  puffed out the smoke, he tried to think what could be done.    \"The Glass Cat seems all right,\" he said, \"an' my wooden leg didn't  take roots and grow, either.  So it's only flesh that gets caught.\"    \"It's magic that does it, Cap'n!\"    \"I know, Trot, and that's what sticks me.  We're livin' in a magic  country, but neither of us knows any magic an' so we can't help  ourselves.\"    \"Couldn't the Wizard of Oz help us--or Glinda the Good?\" asked the  little girl.    \"Ah, now we're beginnin' to reason,\" he answered.  \"I'd probably  thought o' that, myself, in a minute more.  By good luck the Glass Cat  is free, an' so it can run back to the Emerald City an' tell the Wizard  about our fix, an' ask him to come an' help us get loose.\"    \"Will you go?\" Trot asked the cat, speaking very earnestly.    \"I'm no messenger, to be sent here and there,\""]]]
