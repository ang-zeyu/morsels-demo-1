This is so obvious to a Briton that he has  ceased to insist upon it, and it is for that reason perhaps that it is  so universally misunderstood abroad. On the other hand, while she is no  gainer by the change, most of the expense of it in blood and in money  falls upon the home country. On the face of it, therefore, Great Britain  had every reason to avoid so formidable a task as the conquest of the  South African Republic. At the best she had nothing to gain, and at the  worst she had an immense deal to lose. There was no room for ambition or  aggression. It was a case of shirking or fulfilling a most arduous duty.    There could be no question of a plot for the annexation of the  Transvaal. In a free country the Government cannot move in advance of  public opinion, and public opinion is influenced by and reflected in the  newspapers. One may examine the files of the press during all the months  of negotiations and never find one reputable opinion in favour of such a  course, nor did one in society ever meet an advocate of such a measure.  But a great wrong was being done, and all that was asked was the minimum  change which would set it right, and restore equality between the white  races in Africa. 'Let Kruger only be liberal in the extension of the  franchise,' said the paper which is most representative of the sanest  British opinion, 'and he will find that the power of the republic will  become not weaker, but infinitely more secure. Let him once give the  majority of the resident males of full age the full vote, and he will  have given the republic a stability and power which nothing else can. If  he rejects all pleas of this kind, and persists in his present policy,  he may possibly stave off the evil day, and preserve his cherished  oligarchy for another few years; but the end will be the same.'  The extract reflects the tone of all of the British press, with the  exception of one or two papers which considered that even the  persistent ill usage of our people, and the fact that we were peculiarly  responsible for them in this State, did not justify us in interfering  in the internal affairs of the republic. It cannot be denied that  the Jameson raid and the incomplete manner in which the circumstances  connected with it had been investigated had weakened the force of those  who wished to interfere energetically on behalf of British subjects.  There was a vague but widespread feeling that perhaps the capitalists  were engineering the situation for their own ends. It is difficult to  imagine how a state of unrest and insecurity, to say nothing of a  state of war, can ever be to the advantage of capital, and surely it  is obvious that if some arch-schemer were using the grievances of the  Uitlanders for his own ends the best way to checkmate him would be to  remove those grievances. The suspicion, however, did exist among those  who like to ignore the obvious and magnify the remote, and throughout  the negotiations the hand of Great Britain was weakened, as her  adversary had doubtless calculated that it would be, by an earnest  but fussy and faddy minority. Idealism and a morbid, restless  conscientiousness are two of the most dangerous evils from which a  modern progressive State has to suffer.    It was in April 1899 that the British Uitlanders sent their petition  praying for protection to their native country. Since the April previous  a correspondence had been going on between Dr. Leyds, Secretary of State  for the South African Republic, and Mr. Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary,  upon the existence or non-existence of the suzerainty. On the one  hand, it was contended that the substitution of a second convention  had entirely annulled the first; on the other, that the preamble of  the first applied also to the second. If the Transvaal contention were  correct it is clear that Great Britain had been tricked and jockeyed  into such a position, since she had received no quid pro quo in the  second convention, and even the most careless of Colonial Secretaries  could hardly have been expected to give away a very substantial  something for nothing. But the contention throws us back upon the  academic question of what a suzerainty is. The Transvaal admitted a  power of veto over their foreign policy, and this admission in itself,  unless they openly tore up the convention, must deprive them of the  position of a sovereign State. On the whole, the question must be  acknowledged to have been one which might very well have been referred  to trustworthy arbitration.    But now to this debate, which had so little of urgency in it that seven  months intervened between statement and reply, there came the bitterly  vital question of the wrongs and appeal of the Uitlanders. Sir Alfred  Milner, the British Commissioner in South Africa, a man of liberal  views who had been appointed by a Conservative Government, commanded the  respect and confidence of all parties. His record was that of an  able, clear-headed man, too just to be either guilty of or tolerant of  injustice. To him the matter was referred, and a conference was arranged  between President Kruger and him at Bloemfontein, the capital of the  Orange Free State. They met on May 30th. Kruger had declared that all  questions might be discussed except the independence of the Transvaal.  'All, all, all!' he cried emphatically. But in practice it was found  that the parties could not agree as to what did or what did not threaten  this independence. What was essential to one was inadmissible to the  other. Milner contended for a five years' retroactive franchise, with  provisions to secure adequate representation for the mining districts.  Kruger offered a seven years' franchise, coupled with numerous  conditions which whittled down its value very much, promised five  members out of thirty-one to represent a majority of the male  population, and added a provision that all differences should be subject  to arbitration by foreign powers, a condition which is incompatible with  any claim to suzerainty. The proposals of each were impossible to the  other, and early in June Sir Alfred Milner was back in Cape Town and  President Kruger in Pretoria, with nothing settled except the extreme  difficulty of a settlement. The current was running swift, and the roar  of the fall was already sounding louder in the ear.    On June 12th Sir Alfred Milner received a deputation at Cape Town and  reviewed the situation. 'The principle of equality of races was,' he  said, essential for South Africa. The one State where inequality existed  kept all the others in a fever. Our policy was one not of aggression,  but of singular patience, which could not, however, lapse into  indifference.' Two days later Kruger addressed the Raad. 'The other side  had not conceded one tittle, and I could not give more. God has always  stood by us. I do not want war, but I will not give more away. Although  our independence has once been taken away, God has restored it.' He  spoke with sincerity no doubt, but it is hard to hear God invoked with  such confidence for the system which encouraged the liquor traffic to  the natives, and bred the most corrupt set of officials that the modern  world has seen.    A dispatch from Sir Alfred Milner, giving his views upon the situation,  made the British public recognise, as nothing else had done, how serious  the position was, and how essential it was that an earnest national  effort should be made to set it right. In it he said:    'The case for intervention is overwhelming. The only attempted answer  is that things will right themselves if left alone. But, in fact, the  policy of leaving things alone has been tried for years, and it has led  to their going from bad to worse. It is not true that this is owing to  the raid. They were going from bad to worse before the raid. We were on  the verge of war before the raid, and the Transvaal was on the verge  of revolution. The effect of the raid has been to give the policy of  leaving things alone a new lease of life, and with the old consequences.    'The spectacle of thousands of British subjects kept permanently in the  position of helots, constantly chafing under undoubted grievances, and  calling vainly to her Majesty's Government for redress, does steadily  undermine the influence and reputation of Great Britain within the  Queen's dominions. A section of the press, not in the Transvaal only,  preaches openly and constantly the doctrine of a republic embracing all  South Africa, and supports it by menacing references to the armaments of  the Transvaal, its alliance with the Orange Free State, and the active  sympathy which, in case of war, it would receive from a section of her  Majesty's subjects. I regret to say that this doctrine, supported as it  is by a ceaseless stream of malignant lies about the intentions of her  Majesty's Government, is producing a great effect on a large number of  our Dutch fellow colonists. Language is frequently used which seems to  imply that the Dutch have some superior right, even in this colony,  to their fellow-citizens of British birth. Thousands of men peaceably  disposed, and if left alone perfectly satisfied with their position  as British subjects, are being drawn into disaffection, and there is a  corresponding exasperation upon the part of the British.    'I can see nothing which will put a stop to this mischievous propaganda  but some striking proof of the intention of her Majesty's Government not  to be ousted from its position in South Africa.'    Such were the grave and measured words with which the British pro-consul  warned his countrymen of what was to come. He saw the storm-cloud piling  in the north, but even his eyes had not yet discerned how near and how  terrible was the tempest.

CHAPTER IX    They were in a cabin at the very nose of the ship, seated on metal  chairs, their hands unshackled and free. Their scarlet guardian reclined  at ease somewhat to one side, but despite his apparent disregard his  cold eyes seldom left the faces of the two men.    Windows closed them in; windows on each side, in front, above them, and  even in the floor beneath. It was a room for observation whose  metal-latticed walls served only as a framework for the glass. And there  was much to be observed.    The golden radiance of sunlit clouds was warm above. They rose toward  it, until, high over the buildings' tallest spires, there spread on  every hand the bewildering beauty of that forest of minarets and sloping  roofs and towers, whose many facets made glorious blendings of soft  color. Aircraft at many levels swept in uniform directions throughout  the sky. The ship they were in hung quiet for a time, then rose to a  higher level to join the current of transportation that flowed into the  south.    \"We will call it south,\" said Professor Sykes. \"The sun-glow, you will  observe, is not directly overhead; the sun is sinking; it is past their  noon. What is the length of their day? Ah, this interesting--interesting!\"  The certain fate they had foreseen was forgotten; it is not often given to  an astronomer to check at first hand his own indefinite observations.    \"Look!\" McGuire exclaimed. \"Open country! The city is ending!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ahead and below them the buildings were smaller and scattered. Their new  master was watching with closest scrutiny the excitement of the men; he  whispered an order into a nearby tube, and the ship slowly slanted  toward the ground. He was studying these new specimens, as McGuire  observed, but the lieutenant paid little attention; his eyes were too  thoroughly occupied in resolving into recognizable units the picture  that flowed past them so quickly. He was accustomed, this pilot of the  army air service, to reading clearly the map that spreads beneath a  plane, but now he was looking at an unfamiliar chart.    \"Fields,\" he said, and pointed to squared areas of pale reds and blues;  \"though what it is, heaven knows. And the trees!--if that's what they  are.\" The ship went downward where an area of tropical denseness made a  tangled mass of color and shadow.    \"Trees!\" Lieutenant McGuire had exclaimed, but these forests were of  tree-forms in weirdest shapes and hues. They grew to towering heights,  and their branches and leaves that swayed and dipped in the slow-moving  air were of delicate pastel shades.    \"No sunlight,\" said the Professor excitedly; \"they have no direct rays  of the sun. The clouds act as a screen and filter out actinic rays.\"    McGuire did not reply. He was watching the countless dots of color that  were people--people who swarmed here as they had in the city; people  working at these great groves, crouching lower in the fields as the ship  swept close; people everywhere in teeming thousands. And like the  vegetation about them, they, too, were tall and thin, attenuated of form  and with skin like blood-stained ash.    \"They need the sun,\" Sykes was repeating; \"both vegetable and animal  life. The plants are deficient in chlorophyl--see the pale green of the  leaves!--and the people need vitamins. Yet they evidently have electric  power in abundance. I could tell them of lamps--\"           *       *       *       *       *    His comments ceased as McGuire lurched heavily against him. The flyer  had taken note of the tense, attentive attitude of the one in scarlet;  the man was leaning forward, his eyes focused directly upon the  scientist's face; he seemed absorbing both words and emotions.    How much could he comprehend? What power had he to vision the  idea-pictures in the other's mind? McGuire could not know. But \"Sorry!\"  he told Sykes; \"that was clumsy of me.\" And he added in a whisper, \"Keep  your thoughts to yourself; I think this bird is getting them.\"    Buildings flashed under them, not massed solidly as in the city, yet  spaced close to one another as if every foot of ground not devoted to  their incredible agriculture were needed to house the inhabitants. The  ground about them was alive with an equally incredible humanity that  swarmed over all this world in appalling profusion.    Their horrid flesh! Their hideous features! And their number! McGuire  had a sudden, sickening thought. They were larvae, these crawling  hordes--vile worm-things that infested a beautiful world--that bred here  in millions, their numbers limited only by the space for their bodies  and the food for their stomachs. And he, McGuire, a _man_--he and this  other man with his clear-thinking scientific brain were prisoners to  this horde; captives, to be used or butchered by those vile, crawling  things!    And again it was this world of contrast that drove home the conviction  with its sickening certainty. A world of beauty, of delicate colors, of  sweeping oceans and gleaming shores and towering cities with their grace  and beauty and elfin splendor yet a world that shuddered beneath this  devouring plague of grublike men.           *       *       *       *       *    They swept past cities and towns and over many miles of open land before  their craft swung eastward toward the dark horizon. The master gave  another order into the speaking tube and their ship shot forward, faster  and yet faster, with a speed that pressed them heavily into their seats.  Behind them was the glory of the sunlit clouds; ahead the gloomy  gray-black masses that must make a stygian night sky over this lonely  world--a world cut off by that vaporous shell from all communion with  the stars.    They were over the water; before them a dark ocean reached out in  forbidding emptiness to a darker horizon. Ahead, the only broken line in  the vast level expanse was a mountain rising abruptly from the sea. It  was a volcanic cone surmounting an island; the sunlight's glow reflected  from behind them against the sombre mass that lifted toward the clouds.  Their ship was high enough to clear it, but instead it swung, as McGuire  watched, toward the south.    The island drifted past, and again they were on their course. But to  the flyer there were significant facts that could not pass unobserved.  Their own ship had swung in a great circle to avoid this mountain. And  all through the skies were others that did the same. The air above and  about the grim sentinel peak was devoid of flying shapes.    McGuire caught the eyes of the councilor, their keeper. \"What is that?\"  he asked, though he knew the words were lost on the other. He nodded his  head toward the distant peak, and his question was plainly in regard to  the island. And for the first time since their coming to this wild  world, he saw, flashing across the features of one of these men, a trace  of emotion that could only be construed as fear.    The slitted cat eyes lost their look of complacent superiority. They  widened involuntarily, and the face was drained of its blotched color.  There was fear, terror unmistakable, though it showed for but an  instant. He had control of his features almost at once, but the flyer  had read their story.    Here was something that gave pause to this race of conquering vermin; a  place in the expanse of this vast sea that brought panic to their  hearts. And there came to him, as he stowed the remembrance away in his  mind, the first glow of hope. These things could fear a mountain; it  might be that they could be brought to fear a man.           *       *       *       *       *    The sky was clearing rapidly of traffic and the mountain of his  speculations was lost astern, when another island came slanting swiftly  up to meet them as their ship swept down from the heights. It was a tiny  speck in the ocean's expanse, a speck that resolved itself into the  squared fields of colored growth, orchards whose brilliant, strange  fruits glowed crimson in the last light of day, and enormous trees,  beyond which appeared a house.    A palace, McGuire concluded, when he saw clearly the many-storied pile.  Like the buildings they had seen, this also constructed of opalescent  quartz. There were windows that glowed warmly in the dusk. A sudden wave  of loneliness, almost unbearable, swept over the man.    Windows and gleaming lights, the good sounds of Earth; home!... And his  ears, as he stepped out into the cool air, were assailed with the  strange cackle and calling of weird folk; the air brought him scents,  from the open ground beyond, of fruits and vegetation like none he had  ever known; and the earth, the homeland of his vain imaginings, was  millions of empty miles away....    The leader stopped, and McGuire looked dispiritedly at the unfamiliar  landscape under dusky lowering skies. Trees towered high in the  air--trees grotesque and weird by all Earth standards--whose limbs were  pale green shadows in the last light of day. The foliage, too, seemed  bleached and drained of color, but among the leaves were flashes of  brilliance where night-blooming flowers burst open like star-shells to  fill the air with heavy scents.    Between the men and the forest growth was a row of denser vegetation,  great ferns twenty feet and more in height, and among them at regular  intervals stood plants of another growth--each a tremendous pod held in  air on a thick stalk. Tendrils coiled themselves like giant springs  beside each pod, tendrils as thick as a man's wrist. The great pods were  ranged in a line that extended as far as McGuire could see in the dim  light.           *       *       *       *       *    His shoulders drooped as the guard herded him and his companion toward  the building beyond. He must not be cast down--he would not! Who knew  how much of such feeling"]]]
