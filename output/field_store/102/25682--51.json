Dark in  summer and winter, underparts brownish.    _Comparisons._--Smaller than _S. v. setosus_ but color much the same;  resembles _S. v. obscurus_ in size and cranial characters but darker  in all pelages; similar in color to _S. v. vancouverensis_ with which  _isolatus_ is sympatric but with longer tail, longer hind feet,  broader rostrum and larger teeth. For comparison with _S. v. mixtus_  see account of that subspecies.    _Remarks._--_S. v. isolatus_ and _S. v. vancouverensis_ seemingly  approach one another morphologically more closely than do any other  pair of sympatric subspecies of _Sorex vagrans_. The exceptions may be  _S. v. vagrans_ and _S. v. obscurus_ which are geographically  sympatric in a few places although they may be ecologically separated.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 9.

W and 4 mi. N of Haines,  Alaska, are: total length, 110 (104-128); tail, 45.4 (41-52); hind  foot, 14 (14-14). Color grayish brown.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _S. v. longicauda_ and _S. v.  elassodon_ see accounts of those subspecies. Resembles _S. v.  obscurus_ in color but differs in larger skull, longer hind foot and  in somewhat darker color. Larger and darker than _S. v.  shumaginensis_; the two intergrade near the base of the Kenai  Peninsula.    _Remarks._--This subspecies is transitional between the large, usually  dark subspecies of the southeastern Alaskan and British Columbian  coast and islands, and the smaller, paler subspecies of western and  interior Alaska. There seem to be no sharp breaks between _alascensis_  and _shumaginesis_. North of Haines, Alaska, size of shrews decreases  in a short distance across a narrow intergradational zone between  _alascensis_ and _obscurus_. Throughout most of its range _S. v.  alascensis_ occurs with _Sorex cinereus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 88.

Locally this snake is  known by the appropriate name of _ranera_.      =Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas= Cope          Chinaja, 4.    With the exception of one that was found dead in camp, all individuals  were taken from low vegetation by day. The dorsum is creamy tan with 28  to 35 (average 32) chocolate brown blotches, and the venter is ashy  white with small brown flecks. Three males have 238 to 248 (average 244)  ventrals and 148 to 154 (average 151) caudals; one female has 239  ventrals and 142 caudals. The largest specimen, a male, has a body  length of 660 mm. and a total length of 943 mm.      =Lampropeltis doliata polyzona= Cope          Chinaja, 1.    One female (KU 57156) having 230 ventrals and 54 caudals was found on  the forest floor by day. This individual has a black snout with a white  bar across the nasals and prefrontals, a white spot in the middle of the  frontal, and a white band across the temporals and parietals that is  bordered posteriorly by a black band. There are 28 white and 28 red  rings on the body. The tips of the red scales are darkened. The black  rings between the white and red rings are not so expanded as to  interrupt the white rings dorsally as in _L. doliata abnorma_ as  identified by Stuart (1948:70). Locally this snake, like all red, black,  and white or yellow banded snakes, is called _coral_ or _coralillo_.      =Leptodeira frenata malleisi= Dunn and Stuart          Toocog, 1.    This specimen, a male having 173 ventrals and 69 caudals, was found  beneath the bark on a log in the forest. In life the dorsum was pinkish  tan with 36 chocolate brown blotches on the body; the venter was rosy  pink.      =Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta= Guenther          Chinaja, 3; Toocog, 11.    If numbers of specimens are indicative of abundance, this is the most  common snake in southern El Peten. All were found at night in the rainy  season. At a pond in the forest at Toocog these snakes were observed on  low vegetation, on the ground, and in the water. Evidently they  congregate at breeding choruses of frogs. One _Leptodeira_ contained a  _Smilisca baudini_ and another contained eggs of _Phyllomedusa  callidryas taylori_. The natives call this snake _nahuyaca_.      =Leptophis ahaetulla praestans= (Cope)          13 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    Both specimens were obtained from trees when they were felled. One  individual (KU 55716) has a body length of 1345 mm. and a total length  of 2035 mm. In life the entire snake was uniform bright green; the eye  was yellow. In preservative the dorsum is dark blue, and the venter is  green.      =Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus= Dumeril, Bibron and Dumeril          Chinaja, 1; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; Sayaxche, 4.    All specimens came from low trees in the forest. The largest specimen is  a male having a body length of 724 mm. and a total length of 1236 mm. In  life the middorsum was a golden tan; the top of the head was a vivid  green. One individual had ingested a _Smilisca baudini_. The local name  is _bejuquillo_.      =Ninia sebae sebae= (Dumeril, Bibron and Dumeril)          Toocog, 1.    This specimen, a male having 144 ventrals and 55 caudals, was found  beneath bark on a log in the forest. There is a black band five scales  in length on the nape followed posteriorly by a red band six scales in  length and then by a complete black band one and one-half scales in  length. The rest of the body is dull red with 16 incomplete black bands  one to one and one-half scales in length on the anterior two-thirds of  the body.      =Oxybelis aeneus aeneus= (Wagler)          Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    One individual was found in a low tree; the other was in a bush. Both  specimens are males; the largest has a body length of 754 mm. and a  total length of 1286 mm. Bogert and Oliver (1945:388) distinguished _O.  aeneus aeneus_ in Central and South America from _O. aeneus auratus_ in  Mexico in that the diameter of the eye is more than the length of the  internasal, whereas in _O. aeneus auratus_ the diameter of the eye is  less than the length of the internasal. Stuart (1958:27) stated that on  the basis of this character three specimens from Tikal in northeastern  El Peten definitely were _O. aeneus aeneus_. Of the present specimens  from southern El Peten, one has an internasal:eye ratio of 1.08; the  other has a ratio of 0.87. A careful review of these snakes is needed to  verify the validity of the characters used to separate the subspecies  and to determine areas of intergradation. The local name for the  vine-snake is _bejuquillo_.      =Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis= Salvin          Chinaja, 1; Rio San Roman, 1.    These specimens are tentatively referred to _P. euryzonus_. KU 57160 is  a female having 130 ventrals, 87 caudals, and 23 black rings on the  body; KU 58150 is a juvenile having 128 ventrals, 79 caudals, and 27  black rings on the body. In both specimens the tip of the snout is  yellow; a broad yellow band on the parietals and temporals is bordered  posteriorly by a black band on the nape. The black rings on the body are  not bordered by yellow, but black rings on the tail have yellow borders  ventrally. In the red interspaces between the black rings, black flecks  and spots, especially posteriorly, tend to form secondary black rings  (Fig. 6a). According to Stuart (1948:71), _P. euryzonus aequalis_ has 25  to 27 black rings on the body, whereas _P. elapoides salvini_, which  also occurs in El Peten, has 15 to 23 black rings.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Dorsal color patterns of _Pliocercus euryzonus  aequalis_ (A) and _Micrurus affinis apiatus_ (B).]    The specimen from the Rio San Roman contained a partly digested  _Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri_. Locally _Piocercus_ is called _coral_  or _coralillo_.      =Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus= (Guenther)          Chinaja, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    Two juveniles were on the forest floor; one juvenile and an adult were  on low bushes. The juveniles have a tan dorsum with reddish brown  blotches; the belly is gray, and the iris is cream-color above and brown  below. The one adult is olive-brown above and creamy white below on the  anterior three-fourths of the body; posteriorly it is black above and  below. There are no paravertebral dark stripes nor pale spots on the  dorsal scales.    Two specimens (one juvenile and the adult) when encountered compressed  the anterior part of the body laterally and struck repeatedly. Locally  the adults are called _sumbadora_.      =Sibon dimidiata dimidiata= (Guenther)          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2.    Both snakes were obtained from trees when they were felled. In life the  dorsum was pinkish orange with dark chocolate brown blotches narrowly  edged with black.      =Sibon nebulata nebulata= (Linnaeus)          20 km. NW of Chinaja, 1.    This specimen, a male having a body length of 544 mm. and a tail length  of 198 mm., was found in a felled tree. In life the belly was pink and  black; the dorsal black blotches were narrowly outlined with pink.      =Spilotes pullatus mexicanus= (Laurenti)          Chinaja, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; Sayaxche, 1.    This large snake, locally called _mica_, seems to be equally at home on  the ground and in low trees and bushes. It is fast moving for a large  snake; two individuals escaped capture. The natives said that this snake  eats other snakes, but examination of stomachs revealed no supporting  evidence.      =Stenorrhina degenhardti= (Berthold)          Chinaja, 1.    This specimen, a female having 158 ventrals, 37 caudals, and a total  length of 489 mm., was found on the forest floor. On the olive-brown  dorsum are 27 irregular, narrow, dark brown, transverse bands. The head  is uniform olive-brown; the chin and labials are cream-color. The  venter is cream-color with a row of brown spots forming a midventral  stripe. A large spider was found in the stomach.    I have refrained from assigning a subspecific name to this snake.  Cursory examination of specimens from throughout Mexico and Central  America reveals a bewildering array of variation in coloration that  suggests that the subspecies _mexicanus_ is not recognizable, or that  two species occur sympatrically in parts of southern Mexico and northern  Central America.      =Tretanorhinus nigroluteus lateralis= Bocourt          Chinaja, 1.    A single male having 136 ventrals, 75 caudals, and a total length of 407  mm. was found by a stream in camp. The dorsum is pale grayish tan with  34 pairs of small chocolate brown spots, some of the anterior ones of  which are connected across the back. A cream-colored lateral stripe is  on the third and fourth dorsal scale-rows anteriorly and the second and  third rows posteriorly. The lower dorsal scale rows are black. The  venter is dark grayish brown with cream-colored flecks anteriorly and  creamy gray posteriorly where the dark color is restricted to the  midventral region and the lateral edges of ventrals and first dorsal  scale-row.      =Xenodon rabdocephalus mexicanus= Smith          Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    Both individuals were found on the forest floor. An adult male having a  total length of 420 mm. has a cream-colored venter with brown flecks. A  juvenile having a total length of 172 mm. has a creamy white belly with  black crossbands.    At the suggestion of L. C. Stuart, I am following Schmidt (1941:501) in  placing _X. mexicanus_ as a subspecies of _X. rabdocephalus_.      =Micrurus affinis apiatus= (Jan)          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 2; Sayaxche, 1.    All specimens were found beneath litter on the forest floor. All are  males having 202 to 211 (average 205) ventrals, 53 to 56 (54.6) caudals,  and 34 to 48 (41) primary black rings on the body. There are no yellow  rings, and black spots in the red interspaces tend to form secondary  black rings (Fig. 6b), the same as in _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_.  The local name is"]]]
