THE MEANING OF THE TERM \"INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE.\"    In the case of a steam-boiler the energy of combustion is transmitted to  water inside an air-tight vessel. The fuel does not actually touch the  \"working fluid.\" In the gas or oil engine the fuel is brought into  contact and mixed with the working fluid, which is air. It combines  suddenly with it in the cylinder, and heat energy is developed so  rapidly that the act is called an explosion. Coal gas, mineral oils,  alcohol, petrol, etc., all contain hydrogen and carbon. If air, which  contributes oxygen, be added to any of these in due proportion, the  mixture becomes highly explosive. On a light being applied, oxygen and  carbon unite, also hydrogen and oxygen, and violent heat is generated,  causing a violent molecular bombardment of the sides of the vessel  containing the mixture. Now, if the mixture be _compressed_ it becomes  hotter and hotter, until a point is reached at which it ignites  spontaneously. Early gas-engines did not compress the charge before  ignition. Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a Frenchman, first thought of making  the piston of the engine squeeze the mixture before ignition; and from  the year 1862, when he proposed this innovation, the success of the  internal-combustion engine may be said to date.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Showing the four strokes that the piston of a  gas-engine makes during one \"cycle.\"]      ACTION OF THE ENGINE.    The gas-engine, the oil-engine, and the motor-car engine are similar in  general principles. The cylinder has, instead of a slide-valve, two, or  sometimes three, \"mushroom\" valves, which may be described as small and  thick round plates, with bevelled edges, mounted on the ends of short  rods, called stems. These valves open into the cylinder, upwards,  downwards, or horizontally, as the case may be; being pushed in by cams  projecting from a shaft rotated by the engine. For the present we will  confine our attention to the series of operations which causes the  engine to work. This series is called the Beau de Rochas, or Otto,  cycle, and includes four movements of the piston. Reference to Fig. 39  will show exactly what happens in a gas-engine--(1) The piston moves  from left to right, and just as the movement commences valves G (gas)  and A (air) open to admit the explosive mixture. By the time that P has  reached the end of its travel these valves have closed again. (2) The  piston returns to the left, compressing the mixture, which has no way of  escape open to it. At the end of the stroke the charge is ignited by an  incandescent tube I (in motor car and some stationary engines by an  electric spark), and (3) the piston flies out again on the \"explosion\"  stroke. Before it reaches the limit position, valve E (exhaust) opens,  and (4) the piston flies back under the momentum of the fly-wheel,  driving out the burnt gases through the still open E. The \"cycle\" is now  complete. There has been suction, compression (including ignition),  combustion, and exhaustion. It is evident that a heavy fly-wheel must be  attached to the crank shaft, because the energy of one stroke (the  explosion) has to serve for the whole cycle; in other words, for two  complete revolutions of the crank. A single-cylinder steam-engine  develops an impulse every half-turn--that is, four times as often. In  order to get a more constant turning effect, motor cars have two, three,  four, six, and even eight cylinders. Four-cylinder engines are at  present the most popular type for powerful cars.      THE MOTOR CAR.    [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Plan of the chassis of a motor car.]    We will now proceed to an examination of the motor car, which, in  addition to mechanical apparatus for the transmission of motion to the  driving-wheels, includes all the fundamental adjuncts of the  internal-combustion engine.[8] Fig. 40 is a bird's-eye view of the  _chassis_ (or \"works\" and wheels) of a car, from which the body has been  removed. Starting at the left, we have the handle for setting the  engine in motion; the engine (a two-cylinder in this case); the  fly-wheel, inside which is the clutch; the gear-box, containing the cogs  for altering the speed of revolution of the driving-wheels relatively to  that of the engine; the propeller shaft; the silencer, for deadening the  noise of the exhaust; and the bevel-gear, for turning the  driving-wheels. In the particular type of car here considered you will  notice that a \"direct,\" or shaft, drive is used. The shaft has at each  end a flexible, or \"universal,\" joint, which allows the shaft to turn  freely, even though it may not be in a line with the shaft projecting  from the gear-box. It must be remembered that the engine and gear-box  are mounted on the frame, between which and the axles are springs, so  that when the car bumps up and down, the shaft describes part of a  circle, of which the gear-box end is the centre.    An alternative method of driving is by means of chains, which run round  sprocket (cog) wheels on the ends of a shaft crossing the frame just  behind the gear-box, and round larger sprockets attached to the hubs of  the driving-wheels. In such a case the axles of the driving-wheel are  fixed to the springs, and the wheels revolve round them. Where a Cardan  (shaft) drive is used the axles are attached rigidly to the wheels at  one end, and extend, through tubes fixed to the springs, to bevel-wheels  in a central compensating-gear box (of which more presently).    Several parts--the carburetter, tanks, governor, and pump--are not shown  in the general plan. These will be referred to in the more detailed  account that follows.      THE STARTING-HANDLE.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--The starting-handle.]    Fig. 41 gives the starting-handle in part section. The handle H is  attached to a tube which terminates in a clutch, C. A powerful spring  keeps C normally apart from a second clutch, C^1, keyed to the engine  shaft. When the driver wishes to start the engine he presses the handle  towards the right, brings the clutches together, and turns the handle in  a clockwise direction. As soon as the engine begins to fire, the faces  of the clutches slip over one another.      THE ENGINE.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--End and cross sections of a two-cylinder  motor.]    We next examine the two-cylinder engine (Fig. 42). Each cylinder is  surrounded by a water-jacket, through which water is circulated by a  pump[9] (Fig. 43). The heat generated by combustion is so great that the  walls of the cylinder would soon become red-hot unless some of the heat  were quickly carried away. The pistons are of \"trunk\" form--that is,  long enough to act as guides and absorb the oblique thrust of the piston  rods. Three or more piston rings lying in slots (not shown) prevent the  escape of gas past the piston. It is interesting to notice that the  efficiency of an internal-combustion engine depends so largely on the  good fit of these moving parts, that cylinders, pistons, and rings must  be exceedingly true. A good firm will turn out standard parts which are  well within 1/5000 of an inch of perfect truth. It is also a wonderful  testimony to the quality of the materials used that, if properly looked  after, an engine which has made many millions of revolutions, at the  rate of 1,000 to 2,000 per minute, often shows no appreciable signs of  wear. In one particular test an engine was run _continuously for several  months_, and at the end of the trial was in absolutely perfect  condition.    The cranks revolve in an oil-tight case (generally made of aluminium),  and dip in oil, which they splash up into the cylinder to keep the  piston well lubricated. The plate, P P, through a slot in which the  piston rod works, prevents an excess of oil being flung up. Channels are  provided for leading oil into the bearings. The cranks are 180 deg. apart.  While one piston is being driven out by an explosion, the other is  compressing its charge prior to ignition, so that the one action deadens  the other. Therefore two explosions occur in one revolution of the  cranks, and none during the next revolution. If both cranks were in  line, the pistons would move together, giving one explosion each  revolution.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Showing how the water which cools the cylinders  is circulated.]    The valve seats, and the inlet and exhaust pipes, are seen in section.  The inlet valve here works automatically, being pulled in by suction;  but on many engines--on all powerful engines--the inlet, like the  exhaust valve, is lifted by a cam, lest it should stick or work  irregularly. Three dotted circles show A, a cog on the crank shaft; B, a  \"lay\" cog, which transmits motion to C, on a short shaft rotating the  cam that lifts the exhaust valve. C, having twice as many teeth as A,  revolves at half its rate. This ensures that the valve shall be lifted  only once in two revolutions of the crank shaft to which it is geared.  The cogs are timed, or arranged, so that the cam begins to lift the  valve when the piston has made about seven-eighths of its explosion  stroke, and closes the valve at the end of the exhaust stroke.      THE CARBURETTER.    A motor car generally uses petrol as its fuel. Petrol is one of the more  volatile products of petroleum, and has a specific gravity of about  680--that is, volume for volume, its weight is to that of water in the  proportion of 680 to 1,000. It is extremely dangerous, as it gives off  an inflammable gas at ordinary temperatures. Benzine, which we use to  clean clothes, is practically the same as petrol, and should be treated  with equal care. The function of a _carburetter_ is to reduce petrol to  a very fine spray and mix it with a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#9)"],[1," ware, and rubbed softly till they stick fast. After a while  the paper is pulled off, but the colors remain. Gold must be applied  over the glaze, and the article fired a second time.    After this decorating, the ware is generally passed to a man who  stands before a tub of glaze, and dips in each article, though  sometimes he stands before the pieces of ware and sprays them with an  air brush. Many different kinds of glaze are used, made of ground  flint, feldspar, white clay, and other substances. Common sea salt  works exceedingly well, not in liquid form, but thrown directly into  the fire. The chief thing to look out for in making a glaze is to see  that the materials in it are so nearly like those in the ware that  they will not contract unevenly and make little cracks. This glaze is  dried in a hot room, then looked over by \"trimmers,\" who scrape it off  from such parts as the feet of cups and plates, so that they will not  stick to the saggers in firing. Besides this, little props of burned  clay are used to hold the dishes up and keep them from touching one  another. These props have fanciful names, such as \"spurs,\" \"stilts,\"  \"cockspurs,\" etc. Often you can see on the bottom of a plate the marks  made by these supports.    [Illustration: IN THE POTTERY    Pieces of coarse pottery being delivered to the kiln for firing.]    The articles now are sent to a kiln to be fired. When they come out  there is another chance for decorating, for colors may be put on, and  another firing will make them look like underglaze painting If the  decorator wishes the ware to have the appearance of being ornamented  with masses of gold, he can trace his design in yellow paste, fire it,  cover it with gold, and fire it again. To make the \"gilt-band china\"  so beloved by the good housewives of the last century, the decorator  puts the plate upon a horizontal wheel, holds his brush full of gold  against it, and turns the wheel slowly. Sometimes the outlines of a  design are printed and the coloring put in by hand. When broad bands  of color are desired to be put around a plate or other article, the  decorator sometimes brushes on an adhesive oil where the color is to  go, and paints the rest of the plate with some water-color and sugar;  then when the oil is partly dry, he dusts on the color in the form of  powder. A plunge into water will wash away the water-color and leave  the oil with the powder sticking to it. Shaded groundwork is made with  an atomizer. Indeed, there are almost as many methods of decorating  wares of clay as there are persons who work at it. The results are  what might be expected from the prices; some articles are so cheap and  gaudy that any one will soon tire of them. Others are really artistic  and will be a \"joy forever\"--until they break.          VIII    HOW THE WHEELS OF A WATCH GO AROUND      If an electric automobile could be charged in fifteen seconds and then  would run for forty hours without recharging, it would be looked upon  as a great wonder; but to wind a watch in fifteen seconds and have it  run for forty hours is so common that we forget what a wonder it is.  When you wind your watch, you put some of the strength of your own  right hand into it, and that is what makes it go. Every turn of the  key or the stem winds up tighter and tighter a spring from one to two  feet long, but so slender that it would take thousands to weigh a  pound. This is the main spring. It is coiled up in a cup-shaped piece  of metal called a \"barrel\"; and so your own energy is literally  barreled up in your watch. The outer end of this spring is held fast  by a hook on the inside of the barrel; the inner end is hooked to the  hub of a wheel which is called the \"main wheel,\" and around this hub  the spring is coiled.    This spring has three things to do. It must send the \"short hand,\"  or hour hand, around the dial or face of the watch, once in twelve  hours; it must send the \"long hand,\" or minute hand, around once an  hour; and it must also send the little \"second hand\" around its own  tiny circle once a minute. To do this work requires four wheels. The  first or main wheel is connected with the winding arrangements, and  sets in motion the second, or center wheel, so called because it is  usually in the center of the watch. This center wheel revolves once  an hour and turns the minute hand. By a skillful arrangement of cogs  it also moves the hour hand around the dial once in twelve hours. The  center wheel moves the third wheel. The chief business of the third  wheel is to make the fourth turn in the same direction as the center  wheel. The fourth wheel revolves once a minute, and with it turns  the tiny second hand.    Suppose that a watch has been made with only the main spring, the four  wheels, and the three hands, what would happen when it was wound? You  can tell very easily by winding up a mechanical mouse or a train of  cars or any other toy that goes by a spring. It will go fast at first,  then more and more slowly, then it will stop. This sort of motion  might do for a mouse, but it would not answer for a watch. A watch  must move with steadiness and regularity. To bring this about, there  is a fifth wheel. Its fifteen teeth are shaped like hooks, and it has  seven accompaniments, the balance wheel, the hair spring, and five  others. This wheel, together with its accompaniments, is able to stop  the motion of the watch five times a second and start it again so  quickly that we do not realize its having been stopped at all. A tiny  arm holds the wheel firmly, and then lets it escape. Therefore, the  fifth wheel and its accompaniments are called the \"escapement.\" This  catching and letting go is what makes the ticking.    A watch made in this way would run very well until a hot day or a cold  day came; then there would be trouble. Heat makes metals expand and  makes springs less elastic. Therefore in a hot day the watch would go  more slowly and so lose time; while in a cold day it would go too fast  and would gain time. This fault is corrected by the balance, a wheel  whose rim is not one circle, but two half-circles, and so cunningly  made that the hotter this rim grows, the smaller its diameter becomes.  In the rim of the wheel are tiny holes into which screws may be  screwed. By adding screws or taking some away, or changing the  position of some of them, the movement of the watch can be made to  go faster or slower.    All this would be difficult enough to manage if a watch was as large  as a cart wheel, with wheels a foot in diameter; but it does seem a  marvel how so many kinds of wheels and screws and springs, one hundred  and fifty in all, can be put into a case sometimes not more than an  inch in diameter, and can find room to work; and it is quite as much  of a marvel how they can be manufactured and handled.    Remembering how accurate every piece must be, it is no wonder that in  Switzerland, where all this work used to be done by hand, a boy had to  go to a \"watch school\" for fourteen years before he was considered  able to make a really fine watch. He began at the beginning and was  taught to make, first, wooden handles for his tools, then the tools  themselves, such as files, screw drivers, etc. His next work was to  make wooden watchcases as large as dinner-plates. After this, he was  given the frame to which the various wheels of a watch are fastened  and was taught how and where to drill the holes for wheels and screws.  After lessons in making the finer tools to be used, he was allowed to  make a watch frame. All this took several years, for he had to do the  same work over and over until his teachers were satisfied with it.  Then he was promoted to the second room. Here he learned to adjust the  stem-winding parts, to do fine cutting and filing, and to make watches  that would strike the hour and even the minute. Room three was called  the \"train room,\" because the wheels of a watch are spoken of as \"the  train.\" The model watch in this room was as large as a saucer. The  young man had to study every detail of this, and also to learn the use  of a delicate little machine doing such fine work that it could cut  twenty-four hundred tiny cogs on one of the little wheels of a watch.  In the fourth room he learned to make the escapement wheel and some  other parts; and he had to make them, not merely passably, but  excellently. In the fifth and last room, he must do the careful,  patient work that makes a watch go perfectly. There are special little  curves that must be given to the hair spring; and the screws on the  balance wheel must be carefully adjusted. If the watch ran faster when  it was lying down than when it was hanging up, he learned that certain  ones of the bearings were too coarse and must be made finer. In  short, he must be able to make a watch that, whether hanging up or  lying down, and whether the weather was hot or cold, would not vary  from correct time more than two and a half seconds a day at the most.  Then, and not till then, was the student regarded as a first-class  watchmaker.    The graduate of such a school knew how to make a whole watch, but he  usually limited his work to some one part. Every part of a watch was  made expressly for that watch, but sometimes a hundred different  persons worked on it. The very best of the Swiss watches were  exceedingly good; the poorest were very bad, and much worse to own  than a poor American watch because it costs more to repair a Swiss  watch than an American watch.    [Illustration: _Courtesy Waltham Watch Co._    WHERE WATCHES ARE MADE    Once a single man made a whole watch by hand. Now one watch may be  the product of a hundred hands, each man doing his particular part.]    Even though in America the parts of watches are made by machinery,  an apprentice has to undergo just as careful and just as extended  training here as in Switzerland. A poor watch is worse than none at  all, and careless work would "]]]
