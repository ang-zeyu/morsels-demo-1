The genera Morchella, Gyromitra, Helvella, and Mitrula contain, however,  what may be considered the most desirable edible species. Types of these  four groups are represented in Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, Plate C.    The plants of these genera have a stem and cap. The cap, however,  differs very much from that of the ordinary mushroom. In the genus  Morchella the cap is deeply pitted and ridged so that it presents a  honeycombed appearance. In Gyromitra the cap is convolutely lobed but  not pitted. In Helvella the cap is very irregular and reflexed, and in  Mitrula the cap is ovate or club shaped and smooth. In all four of these  genera the hymenium is superior, _i. e._, it is on the upper and outer  surface of the cap, the interior surface being barren.    In Plates C and D are figured 9 types of edible fungi included in the  family Ascomycetes, sub-family Discomycetes.         [Illustration: Plate C.

Receptacle pileate or clavate, impervious in the  centre, stipitate, covered with hymenium, which is deeply folded and  pitted.--Cooke.    In this genus the species have a general resemblance to each other in  size, color, form, texture, and flavor. The cap is usually a dull  yellow, sometimes slightly olive-tinted, darkening with age to a  brownish leather tinge. The stems are stout and hollow, white or  whitish. This genus has a very wide geographical distribution, but the  species are not numerous. Cooke describes twenty-four, some of them  found in India, Java, Great Britain, Central and Northern Europe,  Australia, and North America. Peck describes six species found in New  York State. The lines of demarcation between species are not very  decided; but as none of the species are known to be poisonous, it may  be considered a safe genus to experiment with.    In the Morchella esculenta the cap is ovate, in one variety rotund, the  margin attaching itself to the stem; ribs firm and anastomosing, forming  deep hollows or pits; color yellowish tan, olivaceous; spores hyaline,  colorless; asci very long. The Morel, though rare in some localities, is  found in large quantities in some of the midwestern States, sometimes in  the woods along the borders of streams, often in peach orchards, at the  roots of decaying trees.    I am informed by correspondents who have collected and eaten them that  the Morels can be gathered in abundance in the springtime along the  banks of the Missouri and tributary streams. A lieutenant in the United  States Army informs me that he found fine specimens of this species in  the mountains of California, five or six thousand feet above sea-level.  A correspondent, Mr. H. W. Henshaw, writes that he has made many  excellent meals of them, finding them on the banks of Chico Creek,  Sacramento Valley, California, on Gen. Bidwell's ranch, in April. A  correspondent in Minnesota writes: \"The Morel grows abundantly in some  places here, but so prejudiced are many of the natives against  'toad-stools' that I had to eat the Morel alone for a whole season  before I could induce any one else to taste it.\" Mr. Hollis Webster, of  the Boston Mycological Club, reports the Morchella _conica_ as appearing  in abundance in eastern Massachusetts in May of this year. A  correspondent in West Virginia reports that quantities of a large-sized  Morel are found in the mountain regions there.    I have reports also of the appearance of the Morel in Western New York,  and on the coast of Maine and of Oregon. A miner writes to me from  Montana that he and several other miners, having lost their way in the  mountains of that State during the spring of the year, subsisted  entirely for five days on Morels which they collected.    The specimen represented in Plate C, Fig. 1, is figured from a Morchella  _esculenta_ which grew in the vicinity of Falls Church, Va., less than  ten miles from the District of Columbia. The reports which I have  received from correspondents in twenty States show that the Morel is not  so rare in this country as was formerly supposed. The advantages which  this mushroom possesses over some others are (1) the readiness with  which it can be distinguished, (2) its keeping qualities, and (3) its  agreeable taste. It is easily dried, and in that condition can be kept a  long time without losing its flavor. Though it has not the rich flavor  of the common field mushroom, it is very palatable when cooked, and when  dried it is often used in soups. It is very generally esteemed as an  esculent among mycophagists.    Fig. 2 represents the sporidia enclosed in the ascus, or spore sack,  with accompanying paraphyses.         FIG. 3. =Gyromitra= _esculenta_ Fries. \"_Esculent Gyromitra_.\"    _Genus Gyromitra_ Fries. This genus contains very few species, but all  are considered edible, though differing somewhat in flavor and  digestibility. Five or six species are figured by Cooke. Peck speaks of  several species found in New York. One of these, G. curtipes Fries, is  also figured by Cooke as found in North Carolina. This species Cooke  regards as equal in flavor to G. esculenta. G. esculenta has a rounded,  inflated cap, irregularly lobed and hollow, smooth and brittle in  texture, reddish brown. It falls over the stem in heavy convolutions,  touching it at various points. The stem is stout, stuffed, at length  hollow, whitish or cinereous; spores elliptical with two nuclei,  yellowish, translucent. The plant is usually from two to four inches in  height, but larger specimens are found.    Fig. 4 represents the spore sack with enclosed sporidia.    Mr. Charles L. Fox, of Portland, Maine, records the Gyromitra  _esculenta_, of which he sent me a very good specimen last spring, as  quite abundant during May in the open woods near the city named.  Speaking of this species, he says: \"From the point of view of their  edibility, we have classed them under two heads--the light and the dark  varieties. These differ in the locality in which they are found, in  their color and in the convolutions of their surface. Both grow large.    \"The _Light Gyromitra_ is the more easily digested of the two. Its  height varies from three to five inches, cap three to five inches in  diameter. Its cap is inflated, very irregular, and twisted in large  convolutions. These convolutions are almost smooth on the surface,  sometimes showing small depressions; margin generally attached to the  stem in parts. It is a transparent yellow in color. This variety does  not grow dark brown with age. Stem white or very light buff, smooth, and  hollow. It grows best on slopes facing the south, in scant woods of  birch, maple, and pine. We have found no specimens in open places or on  the borders of woods.    \"The _Dark Gyromitra_ is more common than the light variety. Its color  is generally of dark lake brown, even in the young plant, though it is  sometimes of a light warm yellow, which grows darker with age. Stem  flesh-colored or pallid, but not white, nor so light as in the first  variety. Its cap is similar in its large convolutions to that of the  light variety, but it is covered with many intricate vermiform ridges,  sometimes in high relief or even strongly undercut. Grows in mossy  places, in light sandy soil, on borders of pine woods. Its flesh is  brittle, but not so tender as that of the first variety. Both varieties  dry readily. We should advise eating the _Dark Gyromitra_ only in  moderate amounts, as, if eaten in quantity, or if old specimens are  used, indigestion or nausea is liable to follow. In regard to both  varieties, I would advise that only young specimens should be eaten at  first, as they are more tender and less pronounced in flavor than the  older plants. We have eaten, however, a considerable quantity of the  _Light Gyromitra_ with no unpleasant results. The flavor of the  Gyromitras is quite strong, and some have found it too much so to be  agreeable on the first eating. The general opinion here, however, is  favorable to the Gyromitra as an excellent addition to the table.\"    Some German authorities speak well of the flavor of the G. esculenta,  and it is sold in the German markets. Cordier records it as agreeable in  taste when cooked. Peck says that he has repeatedly eaten it without  experiencing any evil results, but does not consider its flavor equal to  that of a first-class mushroom. He advises also that it should be eaten  with moderation, and that only perfectly fresh specimens should be used,  sickness having resulted from eating freely of specimens that had been  kept twenty-four hours before being cooked.    I have not been fortunate in securing a sufficient quantity of fresh  specimens to test its edible qualities personally, but the testimony  received from those who have eaten it seems to point to the necessity  for moderation in eating and care in securing fresh specimens to cook.         FIG. 5. =Helvella crispa=. \"_Crisp Helvella_.\"    _Genus Helvella_ Linn. The plants of this genus are usually small,  though a few of the species are of good size. They are not plentiful,  but they are very generally regarded as edible, the flavor bearing a  resemblance to that of the Morel. The cap has a smooth, not polished,  surface, and is very irregular, revolute, and deflexed, not honeycombed  like the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#9)"],[1,"building up of an establishment which is efficient  but which is in no particular elaborate, the buildings and other  equipment being as simple and inexpensive as possible.    _Lay-out or Arrangement of the Plant._ The plant must be carefully  planned so as to make the best possible use of the land and particularly  of the water frontage. It is particularly important to arrange the  buildings in such a manner as to cut down labor as much as possible. If  there is any expectation of enlarging the capacity at some future time,  this must also be borne in mind in the arrangement of the various  buildings and yards. The incubator cellar should be convenient to the  No. 1 brooder house and the various brooder houses to one another. The  brooder house must likewise be convenient to the growing and fattening  houses and yards and these in turn to the killing house. The feed room  should be centrally located so as to save labor as much as possible in  feeding the ducks.    _Land Required._ For a duck plant of the size indicated 10 acres of land  should be ample. This, however, means that no effort would be made to  grow any of the feed for the ducks or ducklings with the exception of  green feed. In some cases where the lay of the land is unusually  favorable so that the plant can be laid out to the very best advantage,  a smaller amount of ground than this might be sufficient but it is not  well to figure on less than 10 acres.    _Number of Breeders Required._ With the usual methods of management and  with good success, one may estimate that 40 young ducks can be marketed  each year from each breeding female. This is a good average although in  some good years duck raisers will do a little better than this. On the  other hand in poor years they will not do so well. For a plant having an  output of 30,000 market ducks there would therefore be needed in the  neighborhood of 800 breeding ducks in addition to 100 drakes.    _Housing Required for Breeders._ In figuring on the amount of housing  required for this number of breeding ducks, it is necessary to figure on  2-1/2 to 3 square feet of floor space per bird, 3 square feet being better  than 2-1/2. This would require a housing space 20 feet deep by 120 feet  long. However ducks are not usually housed in one building of this size,  and in fact it is better not to do so since the smaller the flock of  breeders kept together the better they will do. In no case should a duck  raiser run more than 400 ducks in a flock and it is very much better to  run them in pens of 100 each. In fact, some breeders do not place more  than 25 to 50 breeding ducks in a pen.    _Incubator Capacity._ Incubators are used exclusively for hatching the  eggs. At the present time in practically all cases some form of hot  water mammoth incubator is utilized for this purpose. An investment is  required both in incubators and in a cellar in which to operate them. In  figuring on the incubator capacity necessary to take care of a  proposition of this size, it is necessary to base the estimate on the  number of eggs produced during the season of flush production. The duck  raiser figures on incubating all eggs suitable for the purpose rather  than to sell any of them for other purposes as there is a greater profit  in rearing and marketing the ducklings. For that reason he must have  incubator capacity enough to take care of all the eggs laid at any time  of the year. During the season of flush production the yield will  ordinarily run in the neighborhood of 80%. The period of incubation is  28 days but 2 days more should be added to this to allow for cleaning  out the machines, etc., before starting another hatch. This means that  there would be 30 days between hatches. Figuring on 800 ducks with an  80% production for 30 days an incubator capacity of around 19,200 eggs  would be required.    _Brooder Capacity._ A brooder house capacity, where artificial heat can  be supplied, sufficient to take care of about half of the total output  of the plant at one time is necessary. This means there would have to  be on this plant a heated brooder house capacity for 15,000 ducklings.  About half of this number or 7500 would need accommodations in the  number 1 or warmest brooder house where the heat can be kept up to 65 or  70 degrees in the house itself, and warmer of course under the hover.  The other 7500 ducklings capacity would be in the number 2 house, that  is, a house where heat could be supplied in the early spring and where  the temperature could be run up to 60 degrees. Hovers in such a house  are not really needed but it is common to cover the hot waterpipes with  a platform in order to provide a runway on which one can run a wheel  barrow and thus simplify feeding. Ordinarily after May 1 no heat is  needed in the number 2 brooder house. The young ducks are usually 2 to 3  weeks old when they go into the number 2 house and they stay there for  about 2 weeks depending on the weather. Heat for the brooder houses is  supplied by means of hot water pipes and a coal burning stove such as  are used in brooder houses for chickens. A number 3 or cold brooder  house is also needed where ducklings can be housed and can be driven in  at night and in cold weather after they have graduated from the number 2  house. From the number 3 house a part of the ducklings are taken  directly to the yards where they are housed in open front sheds.    _Fattening Houses or Sheds._ In addition to the brooder houses, there  are required fattening houses or sheds for the ducks when they are moved  from the No. 3 brooder house to the yards. Suitable houses for this  purpose are 16 feet deep by 24 feet long. In front they are 5 feet high  and in the rear 3-1/2 feet. They are set on posts with a base board around  to make them tight. The fronts are entirely open and provided with  curtains which are used only in the winter to keep out the snow. The  ducklings are shut in these houses when desired by means of wire panels  which close the lower part of the front. Houses such as described are  divided into two parts and each side will accommodate 200 ducklings.    _Feed Storage._ Considerable feed storage room is necessary as it is  very desirable to be able to buy feed in quantity and also to carry a  considerable stock on hand in order to offset the possibility of not  being able to secure feed at any time. There should be storage capacity  for 4 cars of 30 tons each, in other words, for 120 tons of feed. Still  greater capacity than this is desirable. In connection with the feed  storage there should be a place where the feed can be mixed and where  feed can be cooked. Two power operated feed mixers are required as one  is not sufficient during the busy season to allow the mixing and feeding  of the mash for both the breeders and the young stock at the same time.  A feed cutter is necessary in preparing the green feed which is mixed in  the mash. The usual type of kettle feed cooker is commonly used for  boiling fish and preparing other cooked feeds but in its place a small  four-horse steam boiler can be utilized to good advantage as this makes  it possible to cook the feed right in the mixer by using a steam hose.    _Killing and Picking House._ A killing and picking house where the ducks  can be prepared for market is another necessary building but this need  not be an expensive building. It must be located with reference to its  convenience to the rest of the plant. It is also desirable to locate it  over a spring if one is available for the spring water can be used to  excellent advantage in cooling the dressed ducklings. When a spring is  not available water must be piped to this building. The killing house is  usually built with at least one side open or partly open. A place is  provided outside the picking room where the ducks can be hung and bled.  Inside room is required for six or eight pickers. A kettle for heating  water to be used in scalding the ducks is necessary as are also tanks in  which to place the ducks after they are picked. Additional room is  needed where the ducks can be weighed and packed ready for shipment.    _Residence._ In addition to the other buildings enumerated, a residence  would of course be necessary. The size and elaborateness of this and  consequently its cost depends entirely upon the owner's needs and  wishes.    _Horse Power._ One horse and wagon for the purpose of drawing the feed  about the plant and for certain other necessary work would be required.  If the owner desires to do his own hauling of the feed from the railroad  and the other necessary trucking he would, of course, have to keep more  horses, a team at least, or an automobile truck. Where only one horse is  kept, this trucking must be hired done.    _Feeding Track._ On many of the larger duck farms, a feed track is  employed in feeding the stock. Such a track consists of a framework of  sufficient strength to support a car filled with mash which is pushed  along the track by hand. The track leads from the feed mixer across the  various yards where the ducks to be fed are located, including both the  breeding ducks, yard ducks and brooder ducks in yards. This involves a  considerable amount of trackage which must be fairly level and which  runs over the yard fences or along the ends of the yards so that the  feed can be shoveled directly from the car into the feeding trays in the  yards. The use of a feed track simplifies the feeding considerably but  its construction is quite expensive. Where a track is not used, the feed  as mixed is dumped into a low wagon which is driven along the yards, or  through them by removing movable panels in the fences and the feed  shoveled from the wagon to the feed trays.    [Illustration: FIG. 16. Power feed mixer. The feed is dumped into a low  wagon from which it is shoveled to the ducks. (_Photograph from the  Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.
