For as among the powers in man's society,  the greater authority is obeyed in preference to the lesser, so must God  above all.    So in acts of violence, where there is a wish to hurt, whether by  reproach or injury; and these either for revenge, as one enemy against  another; or for some profit belonging to another, as the robber to  the traveller; or to avoid some evil, as towards one who is feared; or  through envy, as one less fortunate to one more so, or one well thriven  in any thing, to him whose being on a par with himself he fears, or  grieves at, or for the mere pleasure at another's pain, as spectators  of gladiators, or deriders and mockers of others. These be the heads  of iniquity which spring from the lust of the flesh, of the eye, or of  rule, either singly, or two combined, or all together; and so do men  live ill against the three, and seven, that psaltery of of ten strings,  Thy Ten Commandments, O God, most high, and most sweet. But what foul  offences can there be against Thee, who canst not be defiled? or  what acts of violence against Thee, who canst not be harmed? But Thou  avengest what men commit against themselves, seeing also when they sin  against Thee, they do wickedly against their own souls, and iniquity  gives itself the lie, by corrupting and perverting their nature, which  Thou hast created and ordained, or by an immoderate use of things  allowed, or in burning in things unallowed, to that use which is against  nature; or are found guilty, raging with heart and tongue against Thee,  kicking against the pricks; or when, bursting the pale of human society,  they boldly joy in self-willed combinations or divisions, according as  they have any object to gain or subject of offence. And these things are  done when Thou art forsaken, O Fountain of Life, who art the only and  true Creator and Governor of the Universe, and by a self-willed pride,  any one false thing is selected therefrom and loved. So then by a  humble devoutness we return to Thee; and Thou cleansest us from our  evil habits, and art merciful to their sins who confess, and hearest the  groaning of the prisoner, and loosest us from the chains which we made  for ourselves, if we lift not up against Thee the horns of an unreal  liberty, suffering the loss of all, through covetousness of more, by  loving more our own private good than Thee, the Good of all.    Amidst these offences of foulness and violence, and so many iniquities,  are sins of men, who are on the whole making proficiency; which by those  that judge rightly, are, after the rule of perfection, discommended, yet  the persons commended, upon hope of future fruit, as in the green blade  of growing corn. And there are some, resembling offences of foulness or  violence, which yet are no sins; because they offend neither Thee, our  Lord God, nor human society; when, namely, things fitting for a given  period are obtained for the service of life, and we know not whether out  of a lust of having; or when things are, for the sake of correction, by  constituted authority punished, and we know not whether out of a lust of  hurting. Many an action then which in men's sight is disapproved, is  by Thy testimony approved; and many, by men praised, are (Thou being  witness) condemned: because the show of the action, and the mind of the  doer, and the unknown exigency of the period, severally vary. But when  Thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and unthought of thing, yea,  although Thou hast sometime forbidden it, and still for the time hidest  the reason of Thy command, and it be against the ordinance of some  society of men, who doubts but it is to be done, seeing that society  of men is just which serves Thee? But blessed are they who know Thy  commands! For all things were done by Thy servants; either to show forth  something needful for the present, or to foreshow things to come.    These things I being ignorant of, scoffed at those Thy holy servants and  prophets. And what gained I by scoffing at them, but to be scoffed at by  Thee, being insensibly and step by step drawn on to those follies, as  to believe that a fig-tree wept when it was plucked, and the tree, its  mother, shed milky tears? Which fig notwithstanding (plucked by some  other's, not his own, guilt) had some Manichaean saint eaten, and  mingled with his bowels, he should breathe out of it angels, yea, there  shall burst forth particles of divinity, at every moan or groan in his  prayer, which particles of the most high and true God had remained bound  in that fig, unless they had been set at liberty by the teeth or belly  of some \"Elect\" saint! And I, miserable, believed that more mercy was  to be shown to the fruits of the earth than men, for whom they were  created. For if any one an hungered, not a Manichaean, should ask for  any, that morsel would seem as it were condemned to capital punishment,  which should be given him.    And Thou sentest Thine hand from above, and drewest my soul out of that  profound darkness, my mother, Thy faithful one, weeping to Thee for me,  more than mothers weep the bodily deaths of their children. For she,  by that faith and spirit which she had from Thee, discerned the death  wherein I lay, and Thou heardest her, O Lord; Thou heardest her, and  despisedst not her tears, when streaming down, they watered the ground  under her eyes in every place where she prayed; yea Thou heardest her.  For whence was that dream whereby Thou comfortedst her; so that she  allowed me to live with her, and to eat at the same table in the  house, which she had begun to shrink from, abhorring and detesting  the blasphemies of my error? For she saw herself standing on a certain  wooden rule, and a shining youth coming towards her, cheerful and  smiling upon her, herself grieving, and overwhelmed with grief. But he  having (in order to instruct, as is their wont not to be instructed)  enquired of her the causes of her grief and daily tears, and she  answering that she was bewailing my perdition, he bade her rest  contented, and told her to look and observe, \"That where she was, there  was I also.\" And when she looked, she saw me standing by her in the same  rule. Whence was this, but that Thine ears were towards her heart? O  Thou Good omnipotent, who so carest for every one of us, as if Thou  caredst for him only; and so for all, as if they were but one!    Whence was this also, that when she had told me this vision, and I would  fain bend it to mean, \"That she rather should not despair of being one  day what I was\"; she presently, without any hesitation, replies: \"No;  for it was not told me that, 'where he, there thou also'; but 'where  thou, there he also'?\" I confess to Thee, O Lord, that to the best of my  remembrance (and I have oft spoken of this), that Thy answer, through  my waking mother,--that she was not perplexed by the plausibility of my  false interpretation, and so quickly saw what was to be seen, and which  I certainly had not perceived before she spake,--even then moved me more  than the dream itself, by which a joy to the holy woman, to be fulfilled  so long after, was, for the consolation of her present anguish, so long  before foresignified. For almost nine years passed, in which I wallowed  in the mire of that deep pit, and the darkness of falsehood, often  assaying to rise, but dashed down the more grievously. All which time  that chaste, godly, and sober widow (such as Thou lovest), now more  cheered with hope, yet no whit relaxing in her weeping and mourning,  ceased not at all hours of her devotions to bewail my case unto Thee.  And her prayers entered into Thy presence; and yet Thou sufferedst me to  be yet involved and reinvolved in that darkness.    Thou gavest her meantime another answer, which I call to mind; for much  I pass by, hasting to those things which more press me to confess unto  Thee, and much I do not remember. Thou gavest her then another answer,  by a Priest of Thine, a certain Bishop brought up in Thy Church,  and well studied in Thy books. Whom when this woman had entreated to  vouchsafe to converse with me, refute my errors, unteach me ill things,  and teach me good things (for this he was wont to do, when he found  persons fitted to receive it), he refused, wisely, as I afterwards  perceived. For he answered, that I was yet unteachable, being puffed  up with the novelty of that heresy, and had already perplexed divers  unskilful persons with captious questions, as she had told him: \"but  let him alone a while\" (saith he), \"only pray God for him, he will of  himself by reading find what that error is, and how great its impiety.\"  At the same time he told her, how himself, when a little one, had by his  seduced mother been consigned over to the Manichees, and had not  only read, but frequently copied out almost all, their books, and had  (without any argument or proof from any one) seen how much that sect was  to be avoided; and had avoided it. Which when he had said, and she would  not be satisfied, but urged him more, with entreaties and many tears,  that he would see me and discourse with me; he, a little displeased at  her importunity, saith, \"Go thy ways and God bless thee, for it is not  possible that the son of these tears should perish.\" Which answer she  took (as she often mentioned in her conversations with me) as if it had  sounded from heaven.

Prolonged soaking in a hot solution of potassium bichromate which has  been acidified with sulphuric acid will often prove useful. The glass  should then be washed thoroughly, rinsed in distilled water, and the  solution should then be used.    There are many formulae for the silvering solution, but that used in  Martin's method may be given:--            A--Nitrate of Silver      40 grammes             Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.            B--Nitrate of Ammonium    60 grammes             Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.            C--Pure Caustic Potash   100 grammes             Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.            D--Pure Sugar Candy      100 grammes             Distilled Water      1000 c. cm.         Dissolve and add:--               Tartaric Acid          23 grammes         Boil for ten minutes, and when cool add:--               Alcohol               200 c. cm.             Distilled Water to   2000 c. cm.    For use take equal parts of A and B. Mix together also equal parts of C  and D in another vessel. Then mix both liquids together in the silvering  vessel and suspend the glass to be silvered face downwards in the  solution. Or if a vessel has to be silvered on the inside, the solution  is poured in. In this case, the deposition of silver may be hastened by  immersing the vessel to be silvered in warm water.    In working with a silver solution containing ammonia or ammonium salts  there is sometimes the possibility of forming an explosive silver  compound. It is well, therefore, to avoid keeping such solutions longer  than is necessary, and to bear in mind that any deposit formed by  solutions containing both silver and ammonia may have explosive  properties, especially when dry.

If, in the early stages of his study of glass-blowing, the student  should attempt to work with the very simplest appliances, it is probable  that his progress will be hindered; the use of the apparatus will  require an undue amount of care and his attention will be distracted  from the actual manipulation of the glass. The case is widely different  after he has acquired a certain facility in glass-blowing.    _A Simple Form of Blowpipe._--Although there are even more simple forms  than that described here, we are not concerned with them. The form  described is the simplest with which any considerable amount of  glass-blowing can be carried out with certainty.    This form consists of a tube through which air may be blown with the  mouth, a condensation chamber in which any moisture from the breath can  condense, a blowpipe jet, a supporting piece and a source of flame.    The tube, condensation chamber, and jet are combined in the ordinary  Black's blowpipe, such as is used for blowpipe tests in qualitative  analysis; it consists of a conical tin tube having a mouthpiece at the  small end and a side tube which carries a brass jet. A support for such  a blowpipe may be cut out of a piece of brass or tin-plate, and should  be fastened to a small, flat, wooden board. A source of flame may  consist of an ordinary brass elbow, such as is used on gas fittings, and  into which a piece of thin brass tube (the body of a fish-tail burner  from which the perforated non-metallic plug has been removed will serve  quite well) has been fitted. It is an advantage to flatten the brass  tube somewhat and to file the flattened end to a slope which corresponds  with the angle at which the blowpipe jet enters the burner. The whole  source of the flame should be mounted on a separate base, in order that  it may be moved while adjusting the apparatus to the best relative  positions of flame and blowpipe jet. The complete apparatus is shown by  _a_, Fig. 16.    [Illustration: Fig. 16]    In order to take full advantage of this blowpipe, it is desirable that  the student should learn to maintain a steady steam of air with his  mouth and, at the same time, be able to breathe. This requires a little  practice.    As a first exercise in breathing, before trying to breathe while using  the mouth blowpipe, the student should close his mouth and inflate his  cheeks with air; now, still keeping his cheeks tightly inflated, he  should attempt to breathe through the nose. At first, this may be found  rather difficult, but it becomes remarkably easy after a little  practice. When he has mastered this, the student may practise the same  operation, but with the blowpipe. It is important to bear in mind that  the cheeks, not the lungs, form the reservoir for air used in  maintaining the blowpipe flame. After a while, the student will find  that he can maintain a steady air pressure and yet breathe with complete  comfort.    In adjusting the flame, care should be taken not to blow so hard as to  produce a ragged and noisy cone of fire. A small jet, such as that  commonly used on a mouth blowpipe, will with care give a pointed and  quiet flame, having an appearance similar to that shown in the  illustration.    With a blowpipe like this, it is quite easy to seal glass tubes up to an  inch in diameter, to join tubes up to half an inch in diameter, to bend  tubes, to blow small bulbs, and to make the simpler forms of internal  seal; but the provision for condensation of moisture is not ideal, and  prolonged use of such a blowpipe also tends to produce undue fatigue.    _A Mouth Blowpipe With an Expanding Reservoir._--This form of blowpipe  can be made to give most excellent results; it is highly portable, and  does not produce nearly so much fatigue when used continuously as the  blowpipe described in the last section. Various slight modifications  have been made in its construction during the last eighty years, but  that described below will be found quite satisfactory.    The apparatus consists of a tube through which air is blown from the  mouth, a valve through which the air passes into an expanding reservoir,  and a blowpipe jet in communication with the reservoir.    In making the valve, several essentials have to be remembered; it must  allow a free passage of air into the reservoir, it must open easily, and  must close quickly. A satisfactory form of valve is that shown by _b_,  Fig. 16. The moving part consists of a light glass bulb of about  three-eights of an inch diameter and having a glass stem of rather under  one-eighth diameter and about an inch and a half long. This stem rests  in a guide at the end of a brass tube, the bulb contacting against the  other end which is approximately shaped. The bulb and its seating are  ground air-tight. A very light spring holds the bulb in position.    This valve is fitted into a metal or glass T piece, one limb of which  leads to the air reservoir and the other limb leads to the blowpipe jet;  the limb containing the valve leads to the tube through which the air is  blown in.    A convenient reservoir may be made from a fairly large football bladder.  A network of string should be fitted over the outside of the bladder and  the strings should terminate in a hook on which a weight can be hung, in  order to provide a means of adjusting the pressure at which the air is  delivered to the jet. This bladder should be washed out and allowed to  drain after use.    The air tube which passes from the valve to the mouth may conveniently  be made of brass, but, in order to avoid the continued contact of metal  with the lips of the operator, it should be fitted with a non-metallic  mouthpiece. It is an advantage from the point of view of portability to  have the air tube easily detachable from the T piece containing the  valve.    The blowpipe jets, of which there may be several with advantage, may be  made of glass tubing, bent to the most convenient angle and having an  enlargement or bulb at some point in the tube. This bulb serves as a  final condensing place for any traces of moisture that may escape from  the larger reservoir.    The whole device, blowing tube, reservoir, and T piece may be fastened  to a clamp, so that it can be secured on the edge of any table where  blowpipe work is to be carried out. If the blowpipe is to be used with  gas, the form of burner described under. \"A Simple Form of Blowpipe\"  will be found quite satisfactory.    _The Use of Oil, or Other Non-Gaseous Fuels._--Although gas, when  available, is usually preferred on account of its convenience, there are  several other fuels which give a hotter flame. They have, also, the  additional advantage of not requiring any connecting pipes; but each has  its own disadvantage.    One liquid fuel deserves special mention as being rather less desirable  than the others; this is alcohol. Although very convenient in use, it  has the disadvantage of being rather too highly inflammable and capable  of burning without a wick, thus involving a certain fire risk; the flame  is scarcely visible in a bright light, and the heat given by either the  ordinary flame or the blowpipe flame produced from alcohol is  considerably less than that from a similar flame in which coal gas is  used. For small work, however, the facility with which a spirit lamp may  be lighted may more than counterbalance these disadvantages at times.    _Paraffin Wax._--Where there is no coal gas available and the blowpipe  is only required at intervals, and especially where high portability is  required, there are few fuels so convenient as paraffin wax. This may be  obtained in pieces of a satisfactory size by cutting paraffin candles,  from which the wick has been withdrawn,"]]]
