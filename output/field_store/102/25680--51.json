Mamm., 33:97, February 18, 1952         (part).    _Type._--Adult female, skin and skull; No. 12535/10845 American Museum  of Natural History; Jalapa, Veracruz, Republic of Mexico; obtained on  April 13, 1897, by F. M. Chapman, original number 1203.    _Range._--Central Veracruz, coastal plains and eastern slopes of the  plateau of Central Mexico, see Figure 10. Zonal range: Upper Tropical  Life-zone (Lowery and Dalquest, 1951:537), parts of the Veracruz and  eastern Transverse Volcanic biotic provinces of Goldman and Moore  (1945:349). Occurs from near sea level at Boca del Rio, Veracruz, up to  5500 feet 3 km. SE Orizaba.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium to large for the species; ground color of  dorsum of paratypes near Olive Brown; darkest of specimens of this  subspecies examined (from Potrero Viejo, Veracruz) between Prouts Brown  and Mummy Brown; distal two-thirds of guard hairs of dorsum black,  proximal third dark gray to sooty; hairs of dorsum black-tipped having  subterminal band of Ochraceous-Tawny; sides paler (less of dark brown)  than dorsum; venter Deep Olive Buff to clay color, individual hairs pale  olive buff at tips, dark gray basally; region of throat and chin sooty  gray; ventralmost vibrissae white to base, other vibrissae black to  base; ears dark brown, sparsely haired; forefeet and hind feet  flesh-colored in palest specimens, sooty in darkest; tail pale brown,  slightly paler below than above; presphenoid only slightly constricted  towards midline; average and extreme external and cranial measurements  of 10 adults from Cerro Gordo, Veracruz, are as follows: total length,  118.9 (112-127); length of tail vertebrae, 45.1 (42-50); length of body,  74.0 (69-78); length of hind foot, 16.0 (16); length of ear from notch,  12.8 (12-13); occipitonasal length, 19.5 (19.0-20.0); zygomatic breadth,  10.3 (10.0-10.8); postpalatal length, 7.1 (6.7-7.5); least interorbital  breadth, 3.9 (3.7-4.0); length of incisive foramina, 4.4 (4.1-4.6);  length of rostrum, 6.9 (6.5-7.2); breadth of braincase, 9.5 (9.2-9.7);  depth of cranium, 7.1 (7.1-7.4); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.3 (3.2-3.3); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_a_, and Plate 3_a_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. nigrescens_, see account of  that subspecies. From _B. m. pallidus_, _B. m. brunneus_ differs in:  dorsal, lateral, and facial coloration deeper reddish brown, more  melanins present; venter darker; buff gray rather than whitish buff to  gray as in paratypical series; vibrissae black rather than brownish to  white; tail sooty, less flesh-colored; forefeet and hind feet averaging  slightly grayer; most external and cranial dimensions averaging slightly  larger; nasals less attenuated; presphenoid less hour-glass shaped,  sides more nearly straight.    From _B. m. infernatis_, _B. m. brunneus_ differs in: side of face and  neck deep reddish-brown rather than yellowish-gray (the differences in  dorsal colorations are greater between _brunneus_ and _infernatis_ than  between _brunneus_ and _pallidus_); venter darker buff-gray; tail  brownish rather than flesh-colored; forefeet and hind feet average  slightly grayer; most external dimensions averaging slightly larger;  cranial dimensions nearly the same except length of incisive foramina,  which is smaller; presphenoid differs in much the same way as from  pallidus.    _Remarks_.--Specimens from Chichicaxtle, Puente Nacional, 3 km. W Boca  del Rio, 1 km. E. Mecayucan, and Rio Blanco (20 km. WNW Piedras Negras),  are all paler than the paratypical series and other specimens from  within the assigned range of _B. m. brunneus_. All these specimens from  the coastal plain average considerably paler than those from the front  range and slopes of the mountains. Specimens from Puente Nacional are  intermediate in color between paler, grayish brown, specimens from the  coastal plains and the darker, brown, specimens from the mountains. When  Allen and Chapman (1897:203) described _brunneus_, they did so on the  basis of the darker brown mice from the higher altitudes. The name,  _brunneus_, _sensu stricto_, could be restricted to those mice from the  higher altitudes of central Veracruz. However, when the mice of  intermediate color from Puente Nacional are considered, it seems best to  include the material from the coastal plain with _brunneus_. Crania from  the higher altitudes are slightly larger than, but not significantly  different from, crania of specimens from the coastal plains. Specimens  examined from the coastal plains resemble the darker series of _B. m.  pallidus_ to the west in central Mexico. But there is no evidence of  gene flow between the paler coastal specimens and _B. m. pallidus_ to  the west. In fact, these paler brown mice on the coastal plain grade in  color into the darker brown mice from the mountains. The paler mice from  the coast may be an incipient subspecies.    The type and paratypes seem to have faded somewhat since they were  described by Allen and Chapman (_loc. cit._) and by Osgood (1909:259).  However, the color of the paratypes and other specimens herein assigned  is the feature most useful for distinguishing _brunneus_ from all other  subspecies of _B. musculus_.    _Specimens examined._--Total 187 all from VERACRUZ, Republic of Mexico,  and distributed as follows: type locality, 4400 ft., 16[1] (including  the type), 6[2], 1[3]; _Cerro Gordo_, 1500 ft., 19; _Teocelo_  [= _Texolo_], 4500 ft., 1; _2 mi.

Another had eaten six catfish       six to ten inches long ... a water snake (_Natrix s.       transversa_) about 18 inches long ... frogs, mostly _Rana       sphenocephala_.\" Carpenter (1958:115) mentions \"a juvenile       woodthrush.... Seven last instar cicadas ... a young       cottontail.\" According to Laughlin (1959:84), one moccasin       \"contained the following items: 18 contour feathers of a duck,       probably a teal; one juvenile cooter turtle, _Pseudemys       floridana_; and a large mass of odd-looking unidentifiable       material. The other cottonmouth contained one juvenile pond       turtle, _Pseudemys scripta_....\"         Texas: \"... several ... feeding on frogs.... One ... found DOR       was found to contain a large catfish.\" (Guidry, 1953:54.)    Of 246 cottonmouths that I examined for food items, only 46 contained  prey in their digestive tracts. Almost all of the snakes examined were  museum specimens that had been collected at many places over a period of  about 40 years. It was not known how long each had been kept alive  before being preserved. Therefore it was impossible to determine what  proportion of any population of cottonmouths could be expected to  contain food. The food items were not analyzed numerically because the  scales and hair, by means of which many food items in the intestine were  identified, yielded no clue as to the number of individuals actually  present unless several distinct kinds were found. Each occurrence of  scales or hair was thus recorded as a single individual, although some  such occurrences may have represented more than one animal. The contents  of some stomachs were so well digested that it was difficult to  determine the number of items present. As a rule only one food item was  present in a digestive tract, but a few tracts contained several items  of the same or different species. Three frogs (_Acris crepitans_) were  in one snake and three hylas (_Hyla versicolor_) in another. Still  another individual captured beside a drying pond contained six  individuals of _Lepomis_ each about three inches long and two pikes  (_Esox_) about six inches long.

Most of the unidentifiable matter could be  assumed to consist of remains of amphibians, since they leave no hard  parts. If this assumption is correct, amphibians comprise about 40 per  cent of the diet. Since intestinal contents were included, a volumetric  analysis was not feasible. Therefore, the weight of each type of food  item was estimated and the percentage by bulk calculated from it (Table  13).    Pieces of dead leaves and small sticks constituted most of the plant  material found and presumably were ingested secondarily because they  adhered to the moist skin of the prey, especially to fish and  amphibians. However, some plant materials probably are eaten because  they have acquired the odor of the prey. One cottonmouth contained a  _Hyla cinerea_, several leaves, and five sticks from 37 to 95  millimeters long and from 12 to 14 millimeters in diameter.    Most reports in the literature state that gravid females do not feed,  but four gravid females examined by me containing large, well-developed  embryos also contained evidences of having recently fed. Two of them had  scales of snakes in the stomach or intestine, one contained a six-inch  _Lepomis_, and the other had hair in the intestine and the head and neck  of an adult egret in the stomach.          MORTALITY FACTORS    Natural Enemies and Predators      Published records of other animals preying on cottonmouths or killing  them are few. Reptiles more often than other classes of vertebrates prey  on the cottonmouth. McIlhenny (1935:44) reported on the scarcity of  snakes in areas where alligators were present. Predation on cottonmouths  by indigo snakes (_Drymarchon corais_) was reported by Conant (1958:153)  and Lee (1964:32). Allen and Swindell (1948:6) obtained a photograph of  a king-snake (_Lampropeltis getulus_) killing a cottonmouth but thought  that moccasins are not eaten by _L. getulus_. However, one occasion  reported herein shows that cottonmouths are eaten by king-snakes; and  Clark (1949:252) reported finding 13 cottonmouths, along with other  prey, in the stomach contents of 301 king-snakes (_L. g. holbrooki_)  from northwestern Louisiana. Cannibalism is also common among  cottonmouths. Klauber (1956:1058;1079) cited predation on cottonmouths  by a blue heron (_Ardea herodias_) and a largemouth bass (_Micropterus  salmoides_). Man is probably the greatest enemy of the cottonmouth.  Intentional killing, capturing, road kills, and alteration of the  environment destroy large numbers.      Parasites and Diseases    Allen and Swindell (1948:12) listed several diseases and parasites of  snakes and stated that \"some moccasins captured in the woods are so poor  and weak from parasitic infection that they can barely crawl.\" The only  kind of ectoparasite found on captive cottonmouths in the course of my  study was a snake mite, _Ophionyssus natricus_. An infestation of that  mite was thought to be partly responsible for the death of one captive  moccasin. Other moccasins spent increasing amounts of time in their  water dish after they became infected with mites. Under natural  conditions frequent swimming probably keeps cottonmouths nearly free of  mites.    Endoparasites found included lung flukes, stomach nematodes, and  tapeworms. Lung flukes (_Ochetosoma_ sp.) were found in"]]]
