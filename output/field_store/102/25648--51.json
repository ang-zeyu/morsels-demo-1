If he chance to  follow his wood road in early June, the ruffed grouse limps and flutters  along it before him, while her callow chicks vanish as if by a  conjurer's trick from beneath his very footfall. A month later, grown to  the size of robins, they will scatter on the wing from his path with a  vigor that foretells the bold whir and the swiftness of their flight in  their grown-up days, when they will stir the steadiest nerve, whether  they hurtle from an October-painted thicket or from the blue shadows of  untracked snow. No one is likelier to see and hear the strange wooing of  the woodcock in the soft spring evenings, and to the farmer's ear first  comes that assurance of spring, the wail of the Bartram's sandpiper  returning from the South to breed in meadow and pasture, and then in  hollow trees that overhang the river the wood ducks begin to spoil their  holiday attire in the work and care of housekeeping. The fox burrows and  breeds in the farmer's woods. The raccoon's den is there in ledge or  hollow tree. The hare makes her form in the shadow of his evergreens,  where she dons her dress of tawny or white to match the brown floor of  the woods or its soft covering of snow. The bass comes to his river in  May to spawn, the pike-perch for food, and the perch lives there, as  perhaps the trout does in his brook.    All these are his tenants, or his summer boarders, and if he knows not  something of their lives, and when and where to find them at home or in  their favorite resorts, he is a careless landlord. His life will be the  pleasanter for the interest he takes in theirs, and the skill he  acquires in bringing them to bag and creel.          XIX    TO A TRESPASS SIGN      Scene, _A Wood. An old man with a fishing-rod speaks_:--    What strange object is this which I behold, incongruous in its staring  whiteness of fresh paint and black lettering, its straightness of lines  and abrupt irregularity amid the soft tints and graceful curves of this  sylvan scene? As I live, a trespass sign!    Thou inanimate yet most impertinent thing, dumb yet commanding me with  most imperative words to depart hence, how dost thou dare forbid my  entrance upon what has so long been my own, even as it is the birds' and  beasts' and fishes', not by lease or title deed, but of natural right?  Hither from time immemorial have they come at will and so departed at no  man's behest, as have I since the happy days when a barefoot boy I cast  my worm-baited hook among the crystal foam bells, or bearing the heavy  burden of my grandsire's rusty flint-lock, I stalked the wily grouse in  the diurnal twilight of these thickets.    Here was I thrilled by the capture of my first trout; here exulted over  the downfall of my first woodcock; here, grown to man's estate, I  learned to cast the fly; here beheld my first dog draw on his game, and  here, year after year, till my locks have grown gray, have I come, sharp  set with months of longing, to live again for a little while the  carefree days of youth.    Never have I been bidden to depart but by storm or nightfall or satiety,  until now thou confrontest me with thy impudent mandate, thou, thou  contemptible, but yet not to be despised nor unheeded parallelogram of  painted deal, with thy legal phrases and impending penalties; thou, the  silent yet terribly impressive representative of men whose purses are  longer than mine!    What is their right to this stream, these woods, compared with mine?  Theirs is only gained by purchase, confirmed by scrawled parchment,  signed and sealed; mine a birthright, as always I hoped it might be of  my sons and my sons' sons. What to the usurpers of our rights are these  woods and waters but a place for the killing of game and fish? They do  not love, as a man the roof-tree where-under he was born, these arches  and low aisles of the woods; they do not know as I do every silver loop  of the brook, every tree whose quivering reflection throbs across its  eddies; its voice is only babble to their ears, the song of the pines  tells them no story of bygone years.    Of all comers here, I who expected most kindly welcome am most  inhospitably treated. All my old familiars, the birds, the beasts, and  the fishes, may fly over thee, walk beneath thee, swim around thee, but  to me thou art a wall that I may not pass.    I despise thee and spit upon thee, thou most impudent intruder, thou  insolent sentinel, thou odious monument of selfishness, but I dare not  lay hands upon thee and cast thee down and trample thee in the dust of  the earth as thou shouldst of right be entreated. To rid myself of thy  hateful sight, I can only turn my back upon thee and depart with sorrow  and anger in my heart.    Mayst thou keep nothing but disappointment for the greedy wretches who  set thee here.          XX    A GENTLE SPORTSMAN      All the skill of woodcraft that goes to the making of the successful  hunter with the gun, must be possessed by him who hunts his game with  the camera. His must be the stealthy, panther-like tread that breaks no  twig nor rustles the fallen leaves. His the eye that reads at a glance  the signs that to the ordinary sight are a blank or at most are an  untranslatable enigma. His a patience that counts time as nothing when  measured with the object sought. When by the use and practice of these,  he has drawn within a closer range of his timid game than his brother of  the gun need attain, he pulls trigger of a weapon that destroys not, but  preserves its unharmed quarry in the very counterfeit of life and  motion. The wild world is not made the poorer by one life for his shot,  nor nature's peace disturbed, nor her nicely adjusted balance jarred.    He bears home his game, wearing still its pretty ways of life in the  midst of its loved surroundings, the swaying hemlock bough where the  grouse perched, the bending ferns about the deer's couch, the dew-beaded  sedges where the woodcock skulks in the shadows of the alders, the  lichened trunks and dim vistas of primeval woods, the sheen of voiceless  waterfalls, the flash of sunlit waves that never break.    His trophies the moth may not assail. His game touches a finer sense  than the palate possesses, satisfies a nobler appetite than the  stomach's craving, and furnishes forth a feast that, ever spread, ever  invites, and never palls upon the taste.    Moreover, this gentlest of sportsmen is hampered by no restrictions of  close time, nor confronted by penalties of trespass. All seasons are  open for his bloodless forays, all woods and waters free to his harmless  weapon.    Neither is he trammeled by any nice distinctions as to what may or may  not be considered game. Everything counts in his score. The eagle on  his craggy perch, the high-hole on his hollow tree, are as legitimate  game for him as the deer and grouse. All things beautiful and wild and  picturesque are his, yet he kills them not, but makes them a living and  enduring joy, to himself and all who behold them.          XXI    JULY DAYS      The woods are dense with full-grown leafage. Of all the trees, only the  basswood has delayed its blossoming, to crown the height of summer and  fill the sun-steeped air with a perfume that calls all the wild bees  from hollow tree and scant woodside gleaning to a wealth of honey  gathering, and all the hive-dwellers from their board-built homes to a  finer and sweeter pillage than is offered by the odorous white sea of  buckwheat. Half the flowers of wood and fields are out of bloom.  Herdsgrass, clover and daisy are falling before the mower. The early  grain fields have already caught the color of the sun, and the tasseling  corn rustles its broad leaves above the rich loam that the woodcock  delights to bore.    The dwindling streams have lost their boisterous clamor of springtide  and wimple with subdued voices over beds too shallow to hide a minnow  or his poised shadow on the sunlit shallows. The sharp eye of the angler  probes the green depths of the slowly swirling pools, and discovers the  secrets of the big fish which congregate therein.    The river has marked the stages of its decreasing volume with many lines  along its steep banks. It discloses the muskrat's doorway, to which he  once dived so gracefully, but now must clumsily climb to. Rafts of  driftwood bridge the shallow current sunk so low that the lithe willows  bend in vain to kiss its warm bosom. This only the swaying trails of  water-weeds and rustling sedges toy with now; and swift-winged swallows  coyly touch. There is not depth to hide the scurrying schools of  minnows, the half of whom fly into the air in a curving burst of silver  shower before the rush of a pickerel, whose green and mottled sides  gleam like a swift-shot arrow in the downright sunbeams.    The sandpiper tilts along the shelving shore. Out of an embowered harbor  a wood duck convoys her fleet of ducklings, and on the ripples of  their wake the anchored argosies of the water lilies toss and cast  adrift their cargoes of perfume. Above them the green heron perches on  an overhanging branch, uncouth but alert, whether sentinel or scout,  flapping his awkward way along the ambient bends and reaches. With slow  wing-beats he signals the coming of some more lazily moving boat, that  drifts at the languid will of the current or indolent pull of oars that  grate on the golden-meshed sand and pebbles.    Lazily, unexpectantly, the angler casts his line, to be only a  convenient perch for the dragonflies; for the fish, save the affrighted  minnows and the hungry pickerel, are as lazy as he. To-day he may enjoy  to the full the contemplative man's recreation, nor have his  contemplations disturbed by any finny folk of the under-water world,  while dreamily he floats in sunshine and dappled shadow, so at one with  the placid waters and quiet shores that wood duck, sandpiper, and heron  scarcely note his unobtrusive presence.    No such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36866"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 3 (of 8) (#9)"],[1,"seventy-five British subjects,  including the men that came from Bastards--under the command of Captain  Baker stood out valiantly, fighting with rare obstinacy, and hoping that  British success elsewhere would speedily draw off the intermittent  attentions of the Boers. From the 13th to the 20th of November a strong  party of Dutchmen kept up incessant pressure, but they were forced to  retreat, though both sides suffered loss. On the part of the British one  special constable was killed.    The official details of the defence showed that the Mission Station  which was formerly the centre of Dr. Moffat's long work among the  natives of that part of Africa was the point of resistance to the Boer  attack. When the Dutch commandant notified the magistrate of his  intention to occupy the place, the latter replied that he had orders to  defend it. Thereupon he collected twenty natives and thirty half-castes,  with whose aid he barricaded the Mission Chapel, and there resisted the  assault of 500 Boers for six days and nights, after which the Boers  abandoned the attack.    To look back on the amazing valour of the tiny garrison, unsuccessful  though it was, makes every British heart swell with pride. On the  outbreak of hostilities, Mr. Hilliard, the Resident Magistrate, called a  meeting of the inhabitants, and eloquently urged them to remain loyal.  This, as we know, they did, with the result that the place resisted the  Boers and routed them, and, moreover, set a most salutary example of  loyalty to the surrounding districts of Cape Colony. The following  extracts from five short letters (all dated November 24), written by Mr.  and Mrs. Hilliard to relatives, will be of interest, as showing the  gallant spirit that sustained these brave people, and the love for Queen  and country that was so practically displayed by them. Mr. Hilliard  said:--\"Just a short letter to say we have been fighting the Boers here  from the 13th to the 18th, and have driven them back with heavy loss. I  received a letter from their 'Fighting General,' Visser, on Sunday the  12th, saying that if I did not surrender the town voluntarily, he would  take it by main force. I replied that if he did he would have to take  the consequences of his illegal act, as my Government had not instructed  me to evacuate the town. The enemy has drawn off towards Vryburg.\" In  another letter he said:--\"We are going strong; the brave little garrison  is so good and cheerful. The army has gone, but may return, so we are  prepared.\" In yet another he wrote:--\"We are all right up to now, and  shall stick to our dear old flag till the last, whatever happens. May  God defend the right and our dear Queen. Three cheers for all.\" Mrs.  Hilliard wrote:--\"On Monday, November 13, the Boers attacked Kuruman.  Our men fought bravely for six days, after which the Boers departed, and  we don't know if they intend returning or not. Charlie is at the Police  Camp, and looks well and happy. He is very proud of our men. Our men are  still on the alert, and are strengthening their forts, as the Boers will  not return without a cannon. They quite expected this place to be handed  over to them at once, as Vryburg was.\"    This state of affairs continued till the end of the year. On the 1st of  January the plucky little garrison was at last forced to surrender.  This, they said, they would never have done had they possessed a single  cannon. The Boer artillery knocked to pieces the improvised fort before  the white flag was hoisted over the ruins. Four men were killed and  eighteen wounded in the splendid but hopeless effort to hold the open  village against a foe provided with artillery and superior in numbers.  The Boers numbered twelve hundred against some seventy-five practically  helpless men! So the unequal tug-of-war came to an end--we may say, an  honourable end.      In Northern Rhodesia, British subjects were practically isolated. The  telegraph to the south was cut, and the railway--some four hundred miles  of it--was damaged in various places. To show the state of remoteness in  which the unfortunate inhabitants found themselves, it is sufficient to  say that a telegram from London to Buluwayo took sixteen days in  transit. Letters from Port Elizabeth were received about three weeks  after being posted. It may easily be imagined what dearth of news  prevailed, and how even such news as it was, was falsified by rumour.  But the excellent fellows kept heart, although they were, as one of them  said, \"absolutely ignored by the British Government, and had not a red  coat in the country.\" He went on to say, \"We have any quantity of men of  grit, and about a thousand fellows have volunteered to fight out of a  total population of men, women, and children of six thousand at most.\"      So little could reach us as to the doings of Colonel Plumer's splendid  little force, that the following letter from Trooper Young, a barrister,  who joined at the outbreak of the war, may be quoted. It supplies some  early links in the chain of the brave history:--      \"FORT TULI, SOUTH AFRICA, _November_ 9, 1899.    \"I've had a bit of an exciting time since I last wrote--almost too  exciting at one time. Last time I wrote was when we were leaving Tuli  for Rhodes Drift. We arrived there all right after much marching and  counter-marching, mostly by night. The second night of it, for the small  portion we had for sleep I struck a guard; so by the third night I was  in a wretched state from want of sleep. I was always dropping off to  sleep on my horse and suddenly waking up. Moreover, I began to see all  sorts of strange things. Brooks and trees were transformed into houses  and gardens, and then I would come-to with a start and pinch myself and  try to keep awake--a very unpleasant experience. When we reached Rhodes  Drift, our squadron was quartered there alone, and we had a couple of  brushes with the enemy to start with.    \"I missed the first, in which we had much the best of it. We only had  one man hit, and that only slightly, and in return we bowled over a  couple of Dutchmen (others may have been wounded), stampeded their  horses, over a hundred in number (we surprised their grazing guard),  killed or wounded twenty of the horses, and jumped seven. The next fight  was warm for a bit. We had only half the squadron--about forty-five  men--who were reconnoitring round the enemy's fort dismounted. This was  only three miles from our camp and in British territory. We had four men  wounded, and did an equal amount of damage to them, if not more. We got  off very cheap, for their fire was very hot, and very close too. The  third fight came off on November 2, and that was a scorcher. On the  night before it I was on guard. It was a beastly night, raining and  blowing hard, so I got very little sleep when it was my turn off. In the  day I was in charge of the grazing guard with three other men.    \"About one o'clock I got orders to bring in the horses, which I did, and  had just got all the horses tied up when the Dutch started firing on us.  I'd just got into a nice position behind a good big rock when I was  ordered to ride out to warn our outlying pickets. There were three of  them, four men in each, about a mile or a mile and a half away. A risky  job it was too. Two of us were sent. I asked the other man which he  would go to. He chose the one I had wanted, so I had the worst job--two  pickets to warn, and had to ride right through the line of fire. As I  started, one of our officers shouted, 'Don't spare your horse; ride like  h--ll;' and I did too. Directly I got out, ping-ping came two bullets, a  bit high, but others soon followed much closer. I got out, though, all  right, warned the two pickets, and came in with them. We got a bit of a  fusillade on us when we got near the fort, but had no casualties. The  man who rode to the other picket had his horse shot under him; so I  scored--not for long, though, for my own horse was shot soon after.    \"When I got back, I found we were having a very hot time. Our position  was a couple of small kopjes close together. On two sides there was an  open space for about 600 or 700 yards. On the other two sides there was  a lot of bush and a ridge running round us, which we were not strong  enough to occupy. The Boers had in the field between 300 and 400 men, so  we thought; we afterwards found that that was not overstating their  number. Moreover, they had 250 men and one gun at Brice's Store, about  six miles away on the Tuli road, and strong reinforcements at their  camp. They gave us the devil of a time. At first they fired mostly at  the horses. They, poor beasts, had no cover, and nearly every one was  hit. A few broke loose and bolted. Later, they turned their attention to  us. Luckily, their shell-fire was very wild, or we should have suffered  heavily. As it was, we had not a man even wounded; but it was a miracle  we did not, for at times their rifle-fire was very heavy, and now and  then they got a good shell in. I had a narrow shave. A shell burst just  near me, and one of the splinters struck a stone and sent a piece of it  bang against my leg. It cut right through my putties, three folds of  them. I made certain I was wounded, and was much relieved to find there  was no damage done.    \"When the evening came, we had two alternatives--to stay where we were  and wait to be cut up, or try to go through to Tuli. It was finally  decided to do the latter, and it was undoubtedly the right thing to do.  If we had remained, we should have been surrounded the next day, and  every one slaughtered. With ninety men against a thousand we should have  had no show; still, it was a very bitter pill having to sneak off at  night, leaving everything behind (including the few horses left alive),  our kit and waggons, even the ambulance waggon. It was horrible saying  good-bye to our horses. My poor little Whiskey was wounded and very  unhappy; we"]]]
