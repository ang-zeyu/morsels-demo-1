An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#9)"],[1,"teaching, I cannot accept a partnership which,  as far as talent goes, would surely be a credit to me, but which would  compromise me in all other respects.    \"I agree with you in one thing only; namely, that all kinds of property  get too frequently abused in this world. But I do not reason from the  abuse to the abolition,--an heroic remedy too much like death, which  cures all evils. I will go farther: I will confess that, of all abuses,  the most hateful to me are those of property; but once more, there is  a remedy for this evil without violating it, all the more without  destroying it. If the present laws allow abuse, we can reconstruct them.  Our civil code is not the Koran; it is not wrong to examine it. Change,  then, the laws which govern the use of property, but be sparing of  anathemas; for, logically, where is the honest man whose hands are  entirely clean? Do you think that one can be a robber without knowing  it, without wishing it, without suspecting it? Do you not admit that  society in its present state, like every man, has in its constitution  all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors? Is  property, then, in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you  can re-knead and equalize it, if I may so speak, in your metaphysical  mill? One who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur  in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours cannot  be a pure and unwavering utopist. You are too well acquainted with the  economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words  of revolutions. I believe, then, that you have handled property as  Rousseau, eighty years ago, handled letters, with a magnificent and  poetical display of wit and knowledge. Such, at least, is my opinion.    \"That is what I said to the Institute at the time when I presented my  report upon your book. I knew that they wished to proceed against you in  the courts; you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance I succeeded  in preventing them. [5] What chagrin I should always have felt, if  the king's counsel, that is to say, the intellectual executioner, had  followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person! I  actually passed two terrible nights, and I succeeded in restraining  the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical  dissertation, and not the manifesto of an incendiary. Your style is too  lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest  questions of our social order, use paving-stones as their weapons. But  see to it, sir, that ere long they do not come, in spite of you, to  seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal, and that your  vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the  market-place, who might discuss the question in the presence of a  starving audience: we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration.    \"I feel as deeply as you, sir, the abuses which you point out; but I  have so great an affection for order,--not that common and strait-laced  order with which the police are satisfied, but the majestic and imposing  order of human societies,--that I sometimes find myself embarrassed  in attacking certain abuses. I like to rebuild with one hand when I am  compelled to destroy with the other. In pruning an old tree, we guard  against destruction of the buds and fruit. You know that as well as any  one. You are a wise and learned man; you have a thoughtful mind. The  terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong  enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your  intentions; but you conclude in favor of the abolition of property! You  wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind; you attack  the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions; with one word you  arrest the formation of capital, and we build henceforth upon the sand  instead of on a rock. That I cannot agree to; and for that reason I  have criticised your book, so full of beautiful pages, so brilliant with  knowledge and fervor!    \"I wish, sir, that my impaired health would permit me to examine with  you, page by page, the memoir which you have done me the honor to  address to me publicly and personally; I think I could offer some  important criticisms. For the moment, I must content myself with  thanking you for the kind words in which you have seen fit to speak of  me. We each possess the merit of sincerity; I desire also the merit  of prudence. You know how deep-seated is the disease under which the  working-people are suffering; I know how many noble hearts beat under  those rude garments, and I feel an irresistible and fraternal sympathy  with the thousands of brave people who rise early in the morning to  labor, to pay their taxes, and to make our country strong. I try to  serve and enlighten them, whereas some endeavor to mislead them. You  have not written directly for them. You have issued two magnificent  manifestoes, the second more guarded than the first; issue a third more  guarded than the second, and you will take high rank in science, whose  first precept is calmness and impartiality.    \"Farewell, sir! No man's esteem for another can exceed mine for you.    \"BLANQUI.\"      I should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent  letter; but I confess that I am more inclined to realize the prediction  with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of  my antagonists. So much controversy fatigues and wearies me. The  intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in  battle: it is intelligence wasted. M. Blanqui acknowledges that property  is abused in many harmful ways; I call PROPERTY the sum these abuses  exclusively. To each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need  knocking off; but, the operation performed, M. Blanqui maintains  that the figure will still be a polygon (an hypothesis admitted in  mathematics, although not proven), while I consider that this figure  will be a circle. Honest people can at least understand one another.    For the rest, I allow that, in the present state of the question, the  mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition  of property. To gain the victory for one's cause, it does not suffice  simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized, which has the  indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political  theories; it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle, and  to formulate the system which must proceed from it. Still further, it  is necessary to show the method by which the new system will satisfy  all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of  the first. On the following conditions, then, of subsequent evidence,  depends the correctness of my preceding arguments:--    The discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing  institutions, save property, or the sum of the abuses of property,  not only may find a place, but may themselves serve as instruments  of equality: individual liberty, the division of power, the public  ministry, the jury system, administrative and judicial organization, the  unity and completeness of instruction, marriage, the family, heredity  in direct and collateral succession, the right of sale and exchange, the  right to make a will, and even birthright,--a system which, better than  property, guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage  of all; which, from a superior point of view, explains, corrects, and  completes the theories of association hitherto proposed, from Plato  and Pythagoras to Babeuf, Saint Simon, and Fourier; a system, finally,  which, serving as a means of transition, is immediately applicable.    A work so vast requires, I am aware, the united efforts of twenty  Montesquieus; nevertheless, if it is not given to a single man to  finish, a single one can commence, the enterprise. The road that he  shall traverse will suffice to show the end and assure the result.            WHAT IS PROPERTY? OR,    AN INQUIRY INTO THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND OF GOVERNMENT.          FIRST MEMOIR.         _Adversus hostem aeterna auctertas esto._         Against the enemy, revendication is eternal. LAW OF THE       TWELVE TABLES.          CHAPTER I. METHOD PURSUED IN THIS WORK.--THE IDEA OF A REVOLUTION.    If I were asked to answer the following question: WHAT IS SLAVERY? and I  should answer in one word, IT IS MURDER, my meaning would be understood  at once. No extended argument would be required to show that the power  to take from a man his thought, his will, his personality, is a power of  life and death; and that to enslave a man is to kill him. Why, then, to  this other question: WHAT IS PROPERTY! may I not likewise answer, IT  IS ROBBERY, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second  proposition being no other than a transformation of the first?    I undertake to discuss the vital principle of our government and our  institutions, property: I am in my right. I may be mistaken in the  conclusion which shall result from my investigations: I am in my right.  I think best to place the last thought of my book first: still am I in  my right.    Such an author teaches that property is a civil right, born of  occupation and sanctioned by law; another maintains that it is a natural  right, originating in labor,--and both of these doctrines, totally  opposed as they may seem, are encouraged and applauded. I contend that  neither labor, nor occupation, nor law, can create property; that it is  an effect without a cause: am I censurable?    But murmurs arise!    PROPERTY IS ROBBERY! That is the war-cry of '93! That is the signal of  revolutions!    Reader, calm yourself: I am no agent of discord, no firebrand of  sedition. I anticipate history by a few days; I disclose a truth whose  development we may try in vain to arrest; I write the preamble of  our future constitution.

Did they have any black cat stories?\"    \"No sir, boss, we was educated Negroes on our plantation. The old  bossman taught his Negroes not to believe in that sort of thing.    \"I well remember when de war came. Old massa had told his folks befo' de  war began dat it was comin', so we was ready for it.    \"Beforehand the master called all the servants he could trust and told  them to get together all of the silver and other things of value. They  did that, he explained and afterward they took the big box of treasures  and carried it out in the forest and hid it under the trunk of a tree  which was marked. None of the Negroes ever told the Yankees where it was  so when the war ended the master had his silver back. Of course the war  left him without some of the things which he used to have but he never  suffered.    \"Then de war came and we all went to fight the Yankees. I was a body  servant to the master, and once a bullet took off his hat. We all  thought he was shot but he wasn't, and I was standin' by his side all  the time.    \"I remember Stonewall Jackson. He was a big man with long whiskers, and  very brave. We all fought wid him until his death.    \"We wan't beaten, we was starved out! Sometimes we had parched corn to  eat and sometimes we didn't have a bite o' nothin', because the Union  mens come and tuck all the food for their selves. I can still remember  part of my ninety years. I remembers we fought all de way from Virginia  and winded up in Manassas Gap.    \"When time came for freedom most of us was glad. We liked the Yankees.  They was good to us. 'You is all now free. You can stay on the  plantation or you can go.' We all stayed there until old massa died. Den  I worked on de Seaboard Airline when it come to Birmingham. I have been  here ever since.    [Illustration: _Gus Brown, Birmingham, Alabama_]    \"In all de years since de war I cannot forget old massa. He was good and  kind. He never believed in slavery but his money was tied up in slaves  and he didn't want to lose all he had.    \"I knows I will see him in heaven and even though I have to walk ten  miles for a bite of bread I can still be happy to think about the good  times we had then. I am a Confederate veteran but my house burned up wid  de medals and I don't get a pension.    \"Thank you, mister bossman, fer the quarter. It will buy me a little  grub. I'se too old to work but I has to.\"    The reporter left him sitting with his little pack and a long fork in  his hands; in his eyes, dimmed with age, a far-off look and a tear of  longing for the Old Plantation.          Walter Calloway          *Interview with Walter Calloway*      --_W.F. Jordan_    _OLE JOE HAD REAL 'LIGION_    Walter Calloway lives alone half a block off Avenue F, the thoroughfare  on the southside of Birmingham on which live many of the leaders in the  Negro life of the city. For his eighty-nine years he was apparently  vigorous except for temporary illness. A glance at the interior of his  cabin disclosed the fact that it was scrupulously neat and quite orderly  in arrangement, a characteristic of a great many ex-slaves. As he sat in  the sunshine on his tiny front porch, his greeting was: \"Come in, white  folks. You ain't no doctor is you?\"    To a negative reply, he explained as he continued, \"Fo' de las' past  twenty-five years I been keepin' right on, wukkin' for de city in de  street department. 'Bout two mont's ago dis mis'ry attackted me an'  don't 'pear lak nothin' dem doctors gimme do no good. De preacher he  come to see me dis mornin' an' he say he know a white gemman doctor,  what he gwine to sen' him to see me. I sho' wants to git well ag'in  pow'ful bad, but mebby I done live long 'nuff an' my time 'bout come.\"    Quizzed about his age and antecedents, he began his story: \"Well, sir,  Cap'n, I was born in Richmond, Virginny, in 1848. Befo' I was ole 'nuff  to 'member much, my mammy wid me an' my older brudder was sold to Marse  John Calloway at Snowdoun in Montgomery county, ten miles south of de  town of Montgomery.    \"Marse John hab a big plantation an' lots of slaves. Dey treated us  purty good, but we hab to wuk hard. Time I was ten years ole I was  makin' a reg'lar han' 'hin' de plow. Oh, yassuh, Marse John good 'nough  to us an' we git plenty to eat, but he had a oberseer name Green Bush  what sho' whup us iffen we don't do to suit him. Yassuh, he' mighty  rough wid us but he didn't do de whuppin' hisse'f. He had a big black  boy name Mose, mean as de debil an' strong as a ox, and de oberseer let  him do all de whuppin'. An', man, he could sho' lay on dat rawhide lash.  He whupped a nigger gal 'bout thirteen years ole so hard she nearly die,  an' allus atterwa'ds she hab spells of fits or somp'n. Dat make Marse  John pow'ful mad, so he run dat oberseer off de place an' Mose didn' do  no mo' whuppin.    \"Same time Marse John buy mammy an' us boys, he buy a black man name  Joe. He a preacher an' de marster let de slaves buil' a brush arbor in  de pecan grove ober in de big pastur', an' when de wedder warn't too  cold all de slaves was 'lowed to meet dar on Sunday 'fo' preachin'.    \"Yassuh, ole Joe do purty good. I spec he had mo' 'ligion dan some of de  hifalutin' niggers 'tendin' to preach nowadays. De white folks chu'ch,  hit at Hope Hill ober on de stage road, an' sometimes dey fetch 'dere  preacher to de plantation to preach to de slaves. But dey 'druther heah  Joe.    \"Nawsuh, we didn' git no schoolin' 'cep'in' befo' we got big 'nough to  wuk in de fiel' we go 'long to school wid de white chillun to take care  of 'em. Dey show us pictures an' tell us all dey kin, but it didn't  'mount to much.

My brudder, he 'bout fifteen year ole,  so he go 'long wid de ration wagon to Montgomery 'mos' ebry week. One  day he come back from Montgomery an' he say, 'Hell done broke loose in  Gawgy.' He couldn't tell us much 'bout what done happen, but de slaves  dey get all 'cited 'caze dey didn' know what to 'spect. Purty soon we  fin' out dat some of de big mens call a meetin' at de capitol on Goat  Hill in Montgomery. Dey 'lected Mista Jeff Davis president an' done  busted de Nunited States wide open.    \"Atter dat dar warn't much happen on de plantation 'cep'in' gangs of  so'jers passin' th'ough gwine off to de war.

Harper, Birmingham_    Living with her grandchildren at 801 Washington Avenue, Birmingham,  Alabama, Esther King Casey, former slave of Capt. Henry King of  Americus, Georgia, recalls from fading memory a few vivid scenes of the  days when men in gray moved hurridly about the town, suddenly  disappeared for a while and then returned, one by one, with weary,  halting tread and hollow faces, while gloom and despair hovered over the  town like a pall of desolation.    Less vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother of  a long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land called  Mobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. Less vivid, too, are  the memories of her own journey to Georgia, where she, with her parents  and brother, were brought to be the slaves of Captain King.    \"I was only four or five years old when we came to Captain King's big  house,\" said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to  recollect. Her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her  speech was surprisingly void of the usual Negro dialect. She is an  example of the former slave who was educated along with the white  children in the family.    \"There were eight or ten slaves in all,\" Esther continued. \"We lived in  a house in the backyard of Captain King's Big House. My mamma was the  cook. Papa was a mechanic. He built houses and made tools and machinery.  Captain King gave me to the 'white lady;' that was Miss Susan, the  Captain's wife. Captain King was a fine man. He treated all of us just  like his own family. The 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and  truthful.\"    When asked if she had"]]]
