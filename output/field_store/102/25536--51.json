The peridia are seated upon  this mycelium, and in most instances are at length open above, taking  the form of cups, or beakers. These organs consist of three strata of  tissue varying in structure, the external being fibrous, and sometimes  hairy, the interior cellular and delicate, the intermediate thick and  at length tough, coriaceous, and resistant. When first formed, the  peridia are spherical, they then elongate and expand, the mouth being  for some time closed by a veil, or diaphragm, which ultimately  disappears. Within the cups lentil-shaped bodies are attached to the  base and sides by elastic cords. These are the sporangia. Each of  these has a complicated structure; externally there is a filamentous  tunic, composed of interlaced fibres, sometimes called the peridiole;  beneath this is the cortex, of compact homogenous structure, then  follows a cellular thicker stratum, bearing, towards the centre of the  sporangia, delicate branched threads, or sporophores, on which, at  their extremities, the ovate spores are generated, sometimes in pairs,  but normally, it would seem that they are quaternary on spicules, the  threads being true basidia. The whole structure is exceedingly  interesting and peculiar, and may be studied in detail in Tulasne's  memoir on this group.    SPHAERONEMEI.--In this very large and, within certain limits, variable  order, there is but little of interest as regards structure, which is  not better illustrated elsewhere; as, for instance, some sort of  perithecium is always present, but this can be better studied in the  _Sphaeriacei_. The spores are mostly very minute, borne on delicate  sporophores, which originate from the inner surface of the perithecia,  but the majority of so-called species are undoubtedly conditions of  sphaeriaceous fungi, either spermatogonia or pycnidia, and are of much  more interest when studied in connection with the higher forms to  which they belong.[Z] Probably the number of complete and autonomous  species are very few.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Cyathus._ _a._ Sporangium. _b._ Section. _c._  Sporophore. _d._ Spores.]    MELANCONIEI.--Here, again, are associated together a great number of  what formerly were considered good species of fungi, but which are  now known to be but conditions of other forms. One great point of  distinction between these and the preceding is the absence of any  true perithecium, the spores being produced in a kind of spurious  receptacle, or from a sort of stroma. The spores are, as a rule,  larger and much more attractive than in _Sphaeronemei_, and, in  some instances, are either very fine, or very curious. Under this  head we may mention the multiseptate spores of _Coryneum_; the  tri-radiate spores of _Asterosporium_; the curious crested spores of  _Pestalozzia_; the doubly crested spores of _Dilophospora_; and the  scarcely less singular gelatinous coated spores of _Cheirospora_.  In all cases the fructification is abundant, and the spores frequently  ooze out in tendrils, or form a black mass above the spurious  receptacle from which they issue.[a]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Asterosporium Hoffmanni._]    TORULACEI.--In this order there seems at first to be a considerable  resemblance to the _Dematiei_, except that the threads are almost  obsolete, and the plant is reduced to chains of spores, without trace  of perithecium, investing cuticle, or definite stroma. Sometimes the  spores are simple, in other cases septate, and in _Sporochisma_ are at  first produced in an investing cell. In most cases simple threads at  length become septate, and are ultimately differentiated into spores,  which separate at the joints when fully mature.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Barren Cysts and Pseudospores of _Lecythea_.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--_Coleosporium Tussilaginis_, Lev.]    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--_Melampsora salicina._]    CAEOMACEI.--Of far greater interest are the Coniomycetous parasites  on living plants. The present order includes those in which the  spore[b] is reduced to a single cell; and here we may observe that,  although many of them are now proved to be imperfect in themselves,  and only forms or conditions of other fungals, we shall write of them  here without regard to their duality. These originate, for the most  part, within the tissues of living plants, and are developed outwards  in pustules, which burst through the cuticle. The mycelium penetrates  the intercellular passages, and may sometimes be found in parts  of the plants where the fungus does not develop itself. There is no  proper excipulum or peridium, and the spores spring direct from a  more compacted portion of the mycelium, or from a cushion-like  stroma of small cells. In _Lecythea_, the sub-globose spores are at  first generated at the tips of short pedicels, from which they are  ultimately separated; surrounding these spores arise a series of  barren cells, or cysts, which are considerably larger the true spores,  and colourless, while the spores are of some shade of yellow or  orange.[c] In _Trichobasis_, the spores are of a similar character,  sub-globose, and at first pedicellate; but there are no surrounding  cysts, and the colour is more usually brown, although sometimes  yellow. In _Uredo_, the spores are at first generated singly, within  a mother cell; they are globose, and either yellow or brown, without  any pedicel. In _Coleosporium_, there are two kinds of spores,  those of a pulverulent nature, globose, which are sometimes produced  alone at the commencement of the season, and others which originate  as an elongated cell; this becomes septate, and ultimately separates  at the joints. During the greater part of the year, both kinds of  spores are to be found in the same pustule. In _Melampsora_, the  winter spores are elongated and wedge-shaped, compacted together  closely, and are only matured during winter on dead leaves; the summer  spores are pulverulent and globose, being, in fact, what were until  recently regarded as species of _Lecythea_. In _Cystopus_, the spores  are sub-globose, or somewhat angular, generated in a moniliform  manner, and afterwards separating at the joints. The upper spore is  always the oldest, continuous production of spores going on for some  time at the base of the chain. Under favourable conditions of  moisture, each of these spores, or conidia, as De Bary terms them, is  capable of producing within itself a number of zoospores;[d] these  ultimately burst the vesicle, move about by the aid of vibratile  cilia, and at last settle down to germinate. Besides these, other  reproductive bodies are generated upon the mycelium, within the  tissues of the plant, in the form of globose oogonia, or resting  spores, which, when mature, also enclose great numbers of zoospores.  Similar oogonia are produced amongst the _Mucedines_ in the genus  _Peronospora_, to which De Bary considers _Cystopus_ to be closely  allied. At all events, this is a peculiarity of structure and  development not as yet met with in any other of the _Caeomacei_. In  _Uromyces_ is the nearest approach to the _Pucciniaei_; in fact, it is  _Puccinia_ reduced to a single cell. The form of spore is usually  more angular and irregular than in _Trichobasis_, and the pedicel is  permanent. It may be remarked here, that of the foregoing genera,  many of the species are not autonomous that have hitherto been  included amongst them. This is especially true of _Lecythea_,  _Trichobasis_, and, as it now appears, of _Uromyces_.[e]    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Cystopus candidus._]    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Xenodochus carbonarius._]    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--_Phragmidium bulbosum._]    PUCCINIAEI.--This group differs from the foregoing chiefly in having  septate spores. The pustules, or sori, break through the cuticle in a  similar manner, and here also no true peridium is present. In  _Xenodochus_, the highest development of joints is reached, each  spore being composed of an indefinite number, from ten to twenty  cells. With it is associated an unicellular yellow Uredine, of which  it is a condition. Probably, in every species of the _Pucciniaei_, it  may hereafter be proved, as it is now suspected, that an unicellular  Uredine precedes or is associated with it, forming a condition, or  secondary form of fruit of that species. Many instances of that kind  have already been traced by De Bary,[f] Tulasne, and others, and some  have been a little too rashly surmised by their followers. In  _Phragmidium_, the pedicel is much more elongated than in _Xenodochus_,  and the spore is shorter, with fewer and a more definite number of  cells for each species; Mr. Currey is of opinion that each cell of  the spore in _Phragmidium_ has an inner globose cell, which he caused  to escape by rupture of the outer cell wall as a sphaeroid nucleus,[g]  leading to the inference that each cell has its own individual power  of germination and reproduction. In _Triphragmium_, there are three  cells for each spore, two being placed side by side, and one  superimposed. In one species, however, _Triphragmium deglubens_  (North American), the cells are arranged as in _Phragmidium_, so that  this represents really a tricellular _Phragmidium_, linking the present  with the latter genus. In _Puccinia_ the number of species is by far the  most numerous; in this genus the spores are uniseptate, and, as in  all the _Pucciniaei_, the peduncles are permanent. There is great  variability in the compactness of the spores in the sori, or pulvinules.  In some species, the sori are so pulverulent that the spores are as  readily dispersed as in the Uredines, in others they are so compact as  to be separated from each other with great difficulty. As might be  anticipated, this has considerable effect on the contour of the spores,  which in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#9)"],[1,". She would even  send her ships for any food that might be offered. This, America would  not permit and Congress was appealed to for ocean transportation. The  Senate voted a liberal appropriation, which was defeated in the House.    Then the Red Cross, with the aid of the citizens of Washington, took up  the matter. They were joined by the Order of Elks, which contributed a  sum of seven hundred dollars, than which perhaps that liberal Order  never made a more timely gift. Funds were raised to charter a steamship  for the Red Cross. The spirit spread generally over the country.  Philadelphia sent a messenger to learn what Washington was doing, and  was advised to charter one of its own ships, which was done, and two  consignments were finally made by them.    Minnesota had already acted, and later, by the advice and aid of the  extra provision of the Red Cross, the Christian Herald sent out its ship  cargo, under convoy of Rev. Dr. Talmage.    But the State of Iowa led all others in active generosity.    Under the supervision of Mr. B. F. Tillinghast, of Davenport, aided by  the able pen of Miss Alice French, that State alone raised, and sent in  trains across the country from Iowa to New York, one hundred and  seventeen thousand bushels of corn and one hundred thousand pounds of  flour, which was loaded onto the \"Tynehead,\" a staunch British ship, and  consigned to the port of Riga.    That year we had been notified of an International Conference to be held  in Rome. The customary appropriation was made by Congress, and again I  was appointed delegate. Too much occupied by the relief at home, Dr.  Hubbell, also a delegate, went in my place to Rome, and from there  reached Riga in time to receive and direct the distribution of the  immense cargo of grain throughout Russia.    When Dr. Hubbell reached Riga he learned that two hundred and forty  peasants had been waiting on the dock two days, watching and waiting for  the ship from America. Not waiting for food, for Riga was not in a  famine province, but waiting that they might not miss the opportunity  and the honor of unloading the American ship that had brought food to  their unfortunate brothers in the interior. As soon as they could get  into the hold of the ship, one hundred and forty of them began the  unloading. They worked night and day, without rest, determined to unload  the entire cargo themselves, without help. But on the third night our  Consul, Mr. Bornholdt, insisted on their having a relief of twelve  hours, and when the twelve hours were up they were all in their places  again, and remained until the cargo was out, declining to take any pay  for their labor. Twelve women worked along with them in the same spirit,  in the ship and on the dock, with needles, sewing up the rents in the  bags, to prevent waste in handling, and cooking meals for the men.    The Mayor of St. Petersburg, in an address on behalf of that city to  American donors, declared:    \"The Russian people know how to be grateful. If up to this day these two  great countries, Russia and the United States, have not only never  quarreled, but on the contrary wished each other prosperity and strength  always, these feelings of sympathy can grow only stronger in the future,  both countries being conscious that in the season of trial for either it  will find in the other cordial succor and support. And can true  friendship be tested if not in the hour of misfortune?\"    A peasant of Samara sent to a Russian editor, together with three  colored eggs, a letter which he asked to have forwarded to America. The  following is an extract from the letter:    \"Christ is risen! To the merciful benefactors, the protectors of the  poor, the feeders of the starving, the guardians of the orphans--Christ  is risen.    \"North Americans! May the Lord grant you a peaceful and long life and  prosperity to your land, and may your fields be filled with abundant  harvest--Christ is risen. Your mercifulness gives us a helping hand.  Through your charity you have satisfied the starving. And for your  magnificent alms accept from me this humble gift, which I send to the  entire American people for your great beneficence, from all the hearts  of the poor filled with feelings of joy.\"    In the gratitude manifested by the Russian Government and people we were  glad to feel that a slight return had been made to Russia for past  favors in our own peril, and a friendship never broken.    The Department of State at Washington, under date of January 11, 1894,  forwarded the following:    \"I have to inform you that on November 7, 1893, the American Minister at  St. Petersburg received from the nobility of that city, through their  Marshal, Count Alexis Bobrinskoy, an address to the people of the United  States. This address, which is in the English language, embodies in  terms fitly chosen the thanks of the Russian people to the American for  the aid sent to their country from our own during the famine period of  the past two years. It is beautifully engrossed and its illumination  embraces water-color drawings which render it a most attractive work of  art.    \"The document, which is superbly bound and enclosed in a fine case, was  duly forwarded to this city by the American Minister at St. Petersburg,  and will be given a conspicuous place in the library of this  department.\"    In so general an uprising of relief no great sum in contributions could  be expected from any one source. The Red Cross felt that, if no more, it  was glad to be able to pay, by the generous help of the city of  Washington, the charter of a ship that conveyed its  corn--$12,500--besides several thousands distributed in Russia through  Tolstoi and American agents there.    We paid the cost of loading, superintended by Mr. Tillinghast in person,  whose financial record shows the exact cost of transportation. All this  was done in connection with the State of Iowa. Our home record showed,  when all was finished, a field closed with a small balance in our favor,  which we had no active call for. By the advice of one of the best  personal advisers, bankers, and friends that the Red Cross has ever had,  this small sum was placed in bank, in readiness for the next call.          VI    THE SEA ISLAND RELIEF      This little timely provision, advisedly made, was none too much or none  too soon.    On the 28th of August, 1893, a hurricane and tidal wave from the  direction of the West Indies swept the coast of South Carolina, covering  its entire range of Port Royal Islands, sixteen feet below the sea.  These islands had thirty-five thousand inhabitants, mainly negroes. At  first, it was thought that all must have perished. Later, it was found  that only some four or five thousand had been drowned, and that thirty  thousand remained with no earthly possession of home, clothing, or food.  The few boats not swept away took them over to the mainland in  thousands, and calls went out for help. In this emergency Governor  Tillman called for the services of the Red Cross, and my note-book has  this passage:    \"The next night, in a dark, cheerless September mist, I closed my door  behind me for ten months, and with three assistants went to the station  to meet Senator Butler.\"    At Columbia we were joined by Governor Tillman, and thus reinforced  proceeded to Beaufort. After due examination the work which had been  officially placed with us by the Governor was accepted October 1st, and  carried on until the following July.    The submerged lands were drained, three hundred miles of ditches made, a  million feet of lumber purchased and houses built, fields and gardens  planted with the best seed in the United States, and the work all done  by the people themselves. The thousands of boxes of clothing received  were distributed among them, and we left them in July, 1894, supplies of  vegetables for the city of Beaufort.    Free transportation for supplies continued till about March. No  provisions in kind were sent from any source after the first four weeks  of public excitement. After this all foodstuffs were purchased in  Charleston and distributed as rations. Men were compelled to work on the  building of their own homes in order to receive rations.    We found them an industrious, grateful class of people, far above the  ordinary grade usually met. They largely owned their little homes, and  appreciated instruction in the way of improving them. The tender memory  of the childlike confidence and obedience of this ebony-faced population  is something that time cannot efface from either us or them.    On the third day after our arrival at Beaufort four middle-aged colored  men came to the door of the room we had appropriated as an office, and  respectfully asked to see \"Miss Clare.\" They were admitted, and I waited  to learn what request they would probably make of me. At length the  tallest and evidently the leader, said:    \"Miss Clare, we knows you doesn't remember us. But we never fo'gits you.  We has all of us got somethin' to show you.\"    Slipping up a soiled, ragged shirtsleeve, he showed me an ugly scar  above the elbow, reaching to the shoulder. \"Wagner?\" I asked.    \"Yes, Miss Clare, and you drissed it for me that night, when I crawled  down the beach--'cause my leg was broke too,\" he replied. \"And we was  all of us there, and you took care of us all and drissed our wounz. I  was with Colonel Shaw, and crawled out of the fote. The oth's nevah got  in. But we all got to you, Miss Clare. And now you's got to us. We's  talked about you a heap o' times, but we nevah 'spected to see you. We's  nevah fo'git it, Miss Clare.\"    One by one they showed their scars. There was very little clothing to  hide them--bullet wound and sabre stroke. The memory, dark and sad,  stood out before us all. It was a moment not to be forgotten.    Our purchases consisted of meat, mainly dry sides of pork, and grits, or  hominy, for eating. For planting, beside the"]]]
