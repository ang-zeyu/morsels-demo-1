Cutting  these diamonds so as to present a thousand facets, he brought all their  latent fire to light, and re-uniting even their glittering dust, he  mounted them in gorgeous caskets. Indeed what settings could he have  chosen better adapted to enhance the value of his early recollections,  or which would have given him more efficient aid in creating poems, in  arranging scenes, in depicting episodes, in producing romances? Such  associations and national memories are indebted to him for a reign far  more extensive than the land which gave them birth. Placing them among  those idealized types which art has touched and consecrated with her  resplendent lustre, he has gifted them with immortality.    In order fully to understand how perfectly this setting suited the  varying emotions which Chopin had succeeded in displaying in all the  magic of their rainbow hues, we must have seen the Mazourka danced  in Poland, because it is only there that it is possible to catch the  haughty, yet tender and alluring, character of this dance. The cavalier,  always chosen by the lady, seizes her as a conquest of which he is  proud, striving to exhibit her loveliness to the admiration of his  rivals, before he whirls her off in an entrancing and ardent embrace,  through the tenderness of which the defiant expression of the victor  still gleams, mingling with the blushing yet gratified vanity of the  prize, whose beauty forms the glory of his triumph. There are few  more delightful scenes than a ball in Poland. After the Mazourka has  commenced, the attention, in place of being distracted by a multitude of  people jostling against each other without grace or order, is fascinated  by one couple of equal beauty, darting forward, like twin stars, in  free and unimpeded space. As if in the pride of defiance, the cavalier  accentuates his steps, quits his partner for a moment, as if to  contemplate her with renewed delight, rejoins her with passionate  eagerness, or whirls himself rapidly round, as though overcome with  the sudden joy and yielding to the delicious giddiness of rapture.  Sometimes, two couples start at the same moment, after which a change  of partners may occur between them; or a third cavalier may present  himself, and, clapping his hands, claim one of the ladies as his  partner. The queens of the festival are in turn claimed by the most  brilliant gentlemen present, courting the honor of leading them through  the mazes of the dance.    While in the Waltz and Galop, the dancers are isolated, and only  confused tableaux are offered to the bystanders; while the Quadrille is  only a kind of pass at arms made with foils, where attack and defence  proceed with equal indifference, where the most nonchalant display of  grace is answered with the same nonchalance; while the vivacity of  the Polka, charming, we confess, may easily become equivocal; while  Fandangos, Tarantulas and Minuets, are merely little love-dramas, only  interesting to those who execute them, in which the cavalier has nothing  to do but to display his partner, and the spectators have no share but  to follow, tediously enough, coquetries whose obligatory movements are  not addressed to them;--in the Mazourka, on the contrary, they have also  their part, and the role of the cavalier yields neither in grace nor  importance to that of his fair partner.    The long intervals which separate the successive appearance of the pairs  being reserved for conversation among the dancers, when their turn comes  again, the scene passes no longer only among themselves, but extends  from them to the spectators. It is to them that the cavalier exhibits  the vanity he feels in having been able to win the preference of the  lady who has selected him; it is in their presence she has deigned to  show him this honor; she strives to please them, because the triumph of  charming them is reflected upon her partner, and their applause may be  made a part of the most flattering and insinuating coquetry. Indeed, at  the close of the dance, she seems to make him a formal offering of their  suffrages in her favor. She bounds rapidly towards him and rests upon  his arm,--a movement susceptible of a thousand varying shades which  feminine tact and subtle feeling well know how to modify, ringing every  change, from the most impassioned and impulsive warmth of manner to an  air of the most complete \"abandon.\"    What varied movements succeed each other in the course round the  ball-room! Commencing at first with a kind of timid hesitation, the lady  sways about like a bird about to take flight; gliding for some time on  one foot only, like a skater, she skims the ice of the polished floor;  then, running forward like a sportive child, she suddenly takes wing.  Raising her veiling eyelids, with head erect, with swelling bosom and  elastic bounds, she cleaves the air as the light bark cleaves the waves,  and, like an agile woodnymph, seems to sport with space. Again  she recommences her timid graceful gliding, looks round among the  spectators, sends sighs and words to the most, highly favored, then  extending her white arms to the partner who comes to rejoin her, again  begins her vigorous steps which transport her with magical rapidity from  one end to the other of the ball-room. She glides, she runs, she flies;  emotion colors her cheek, brightens her eye; fatigue bends her flexile  form, retards her winged feet, until, panting and exhausted, she softly  sinks and reclines in the arms of her partner, who, seizing her with  vigorous arm, raises her a moment in the air, before finishing with her  the last intoxicating round.    In this triumphal course, in which may be seen a thousand Atalantas as  beautiful as the dreams of Ovid, many changes occur in the figures. The  couples, in the first chain, commence by giving each other the hand;  then forming themselves into a circle, whose rapid rotation dazzles the  eye, they wreathe a living crown, in which each lady is the only flower  of its own kind, while the glowing and varied colors are heightened  by the uniform costume of the men, the effect resembling that of the  dark-green foliage with which nature relieves her glowing buds and  fragrant bloom. They all then dart forward together with a sparkling  animation, a jealous emulation, defiling before the spectators as in  a review--an enumeration of which would scarcely yield in interest  to those given us, by Homer and Tasso, of the armies about to range  themselves in the front of battle! At the close of an hour or two,  the same circle again forms to end the dance; and on those days when  amusement and pleasure fill all with an excited gayety, sparkling and  glittering through those impressible temperaments like an aurora in a  midnight sky, a general promenade is recommenced, and in its accelerated  movements, we cannot detect the least symptom of fatigue among all  these delicate yet enduring women; as if their light limbs possessed the  flexible tenacity and elasticity of steel!    As if by intuition, all the Polish women possess the magical science  of this dance. Even the least richly gifted among them know how to draw  from it new charms. If the graceful ease and noble dignity of those  conscious of their own power are full of attraction in it, timidity and  modesty are equally full of interest. This is so because of all modern  dances, it breathes most of pure love. As the dancers are always  conscious that the gaze of the spectators is fastened upon them,  addressing themselves constantly to them, there reigns in its very  essence a mixture of innate tenderness and mutual vanity, as full of  delicacy and propriety as of allurement.    The latent and unknown poetry, which was only indicated in the original  Polish Mazourkas, was divined, developed, and brought to light, by  Chopin. Preserving their rhythm, he ennobled their melody, enlarged  their proportions; and--in order to paint more fully in these  productions, which he loved to hear us call \"pictures from the easel,\"  the innumerable and widely-differing emotions which agitate the heart  during the progress of this dance, above all, in the long intervals in  which the cavalier has a right to retain his place at the side of the  lady, whom he never leaves--he wrought into their tissues harmonic  lights and shadows, as new in themselves as were the subjects to which  he adapted them.    Coquetries, vanities, fantasies, inclinations, elegies, vague emotions,  passions, conquests, struggles upon which the safety or favor of others  depends, all--all, meet in this dance. How difficult it is to form a  complete idea of the infinite gradations of passion--sometimes pausing,  sometimes progressing, sometimes suing, sometimes ruling! In the  country where the Mazourka reigns from the palace to the cottage, these  gradations are pursued, for a longer or shorter time, with as much ardor  and enthusiasm as malicious trifling. The good qualities and faults  of men are distributed among the Poles in a manner so fantastic, that,  although the essentials of character may remain nearly the same in all,  they vary and shade into each other in a manner so extraordinary,  that it becomes almost impossible to recognize or distinguish them.  In natures so capriciously amalgamated, a wonderful diversity occurs,  adding to the investigations of curiosity, a spur unknown in other  lands; making of every new relation a stimulating study, and lending  unwonted interest to the lightest incident. Nothing is here indifferent,  nothing unheeded, nothing hackneyed! Striking contrasts are constantly  occurring among these natures so mobile and susceptible, endowed with  subtle, keen and vivid intellects, with acute sensibilities increased  by suffering and misfortune; contrasts throwing lurid light upon hearts,  like the blaze of a conflagration illumining"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#9)"],[1,", beneath the very roof that  sheltered us, and its ravages, we were told, had extended up the  country as far as Kingston; so that it was still to be the phantom  of our coming journey, if we were fortunate enough to escape from  its head-quarters.    At six o'clock the following morning, we took our places in the  coach for Lachine, and our fears of the plague greatly diminished  as we left the spires of Montreal in the distance. The journey from  Montreal westward has been so well described by many gifted pens,  that I shall say little about it. The banks of the St. Lawrence are  picturesque and beautiful, particularly in those spots where there  is a good view of the American side. The neat farm-houses looked  to me, whose eyes had been so long accustomed to the watery waste,  homes of beauty and happiness; and the splendid orchards, the trees  at that season of the year being loaded with ripening fruit of all  hues, were refreshing and delicious.    My partiality for the apples was regarded by a fellow-traveller  with a species of horror. \"Touch them not, if you value your life.\"  Every draught of fresh air and water inspired me with renewed  health and spirits, and I disregarded the well-meant advice; the  gentlemen who gave it had just recovered from the terrible disease.  He was a middle-aged man, a farmer from the Upper Province,  Canadian born. He had visited Montreal on business for the first  time. \"Well, sir,\" he said, in answer to some questions put to him  by my husband respecting the disease, \"I can tell you what it is:  a man smitten with the cholera stares death right in the face; and  the torment he is suffering is so great that he would gladly die to  get rid of it.\"    \"You were fortunate, C----, to escape,\" said a backwood settler, who  occupied the opposite seat; \"many a younger man has died of it.\"    \"Ay; but I believe I never should have taken it had it not been for  some things they gave me for supper at the hotel; oysters, they  called them, oysters; they were alive! I was once persuaded by a  friend to eat them, and I liked them well enough at the time. But I  declare to you that I felt them crawling over one another in my  stomach all night. The next morning I was seized with the cholera.\"    \"Did you swallow them whole, C----?\" said the former spokesman,  who seemed highly tickled by the evil doings of the oysters.    \"To be sure. I tell you, the creatures are alive. You put them on  your tongue, and I'll be bound you'll be glad to let them slip down  as fast as you can.\"    \"No wonder you had the cholera,\" said the backwoodsman, \"you  deserved it for your barbarity. If I had a good plate of oysters  here, I'd teach you the way to eat them.\"    Our journey during the first day was performed partly by coach,  partly by steam. It was nine o'clock in the evening when we landed  at Cornwell, and took coach for Prescott. The country through which  we passed appeared beautiful in the clear light of the moon; but  the air was cold, and slightly sharpened by frost. This seemed  strange to me in the early part of September, but it is very common  in Canada. Nine passengers were closely packed into our narrow  vehicle, but the sides being of canvas, and the open space allowed  for windows unglazed, I shivered with cold, which amounted to a  state of suffering, when the day broke, and we approached the  little village of Matilda. It was unanimously voted by all hands  that we should stop and breakfast at a small inn by the road-side,  and warm ourselves before proceeding to Prescott.    The people in the tavern were not stirring, and it was some time  before an old white-headed man unclosed the door, and showed us  into a room, redolent with fumes of tobacco, and darkened by paper  blinds. I asked him if he would allow me to take my infant into a  room with a fire.    \"I guess it was a pretty considerable cold night for the like of  her,\" said he. \"Come, I'll show you to the kitchen; there's always  a fire there.\" I cheerfully followed, accompanied by our servant.    Our entrance was unexpected, and by no means agreeable to the  persons we found there. A half-clothed, red-haired Irish servant  was upon her knees, kindling up the fire; and a long, thin woman,  with a sharp face, and an eye like a black snake, was just emerging  from a bed in the corner. We soon discovered this apparition to be  the mistress of the house.    \"The people can't come in here!\" she screamed in a shrill voice,  darting daggers at the poor old man.    \"Sure there's a baby, and the two women critters are perished with  cold,\" pleaded the good old man.    \"What's that to me? They have no business in my kitchen.\"    \"Now, Almira, do hold on. It's the coach has stopped to breakfast  with us; and you know we don't often get the chance.\"    All this time the fair Almira was dressing as fast as she could,  and eyeing her unwelcome female guests, as we stood shivering over  the fire.    \"Breakfast!\" she muttered, \"what can we give them to eat? They pass  our door a thousand times without any one alighting; and now, when  we are out of everything, they must stop and order breakfast at  such an unreasonable hour. How many are there of you?\" turning  fiercely to me.    \"Nine,\" I answered, laconically, continuing to chafe the cold hands  and feet of the child.    \"Nine! That bit of beef will be nothing, cut into steaks for nine.  What's to be done, Joe?\" (to the old man.)    \"Eggs and ham, summat of that dried venison, and pumpkin pie,\"  responded the aide-de-camp, thoughtfully. \"I don't know of any  other fixings.\"    \"Bestir yourself, then, and lay out the table, for the coach can't  stay long,\" cried the virago, seizing a frying-pan from the wall,  and preparing it for the reception of eggs and ham. \"I must have  the fire to myself. People can't come crowding here, when I have  to fix breakfast for nine; particularly when there is a good room  elsewhere provided for their accommodation.\" I took the hint, and  retreated to the parlour, where I found the rest of the passengers  walking to and fro, and impatiently awaiting the advent of  breakfast.    To do Almira justice, she prepared from her scanty materials a very  substantial breakfast in an incredibly short time, for which she  charged us a quarter of a dollar per head.    At Prescott we embarked on board a fine new steam-boat, William  IV., crowded with Irish emigrants, proceeding to Cobourg and  Toronto.    While pacing the deck, my husband was greatly struck by the  appearance of a middle-aged man and his wife, who sat apart from  the rest, and seemed struggling with intense grief, which, in spite  of all their efforts at concealment, was strongly impressed upon  their features. Some time after, I fell into conversation with the  woman, from whom I learned their little history. The husband was  factor to a Scotch gentleman, of large landed property, who had  employed him to visit Canada, and report the capabilities of the  country, prior to his investing a large sum of money in wild lands.  The expenses of their voyage had been paid, and everything up to  that morning had prospered them. They had been blessed with a  speedy passage, and were greatly pleased with the country and the  people; but of what avail was all this? Their only son, a fine lad  of fourteen, had died that day of the cholera, and all their hopes  for the future were buried in his grave. For his sake they had  sought a home in this far land; and here, at the very onset of  their new career, the fell disease had taken him from them for  ever--here, where, in such a crowd, the poor heart-broken mother  could not even indulge her natural grief!    \"Ah, for a place where I might greet!\" she said; \"it would relieve  the burning weight at my heart. But with sae many strange eyes  glowering upon me, I tak' shame to mysel' to greet.\"    \"Ah, Jeannie, my puir woman,\" said the husband, grasping her hand,  \"ye maun bear up; 'tis God's will; an sinfu' creatures like us  mauna repine. But oh, madam,\" turning to me, \"we have sair hearts  the day!\"    Poor bereaved creatures, how deeply I commiserated their grief--how  I respected the poor father, in the stern efforts he made to  conceal from indifferent spectators the anguish that weighed upon  his mind! Tears are the best balm that can be applied to the  anguish of the heart. Religion teaches man to bear his sorrows with  becoming fortitude, but tears contribute largely both to soften and  to heal the wounds from whence they flow.    At Brockville we took in a party of ladies, which somewhat relieved  the monotony of the cabin, and I was amused by listening to their  lively prattle, and the little gossip with which they strove to  wile away the tedium of the voyage. The day was too stormy to go  upon deck--thunder and lightening, accompanied with torrents of  rain. Amid the confusion of the elements, I tried to get a peep at  the Lake of the Thousand Isles; but the driving storm blended all  objects into one, and I returned wet and disappointed to my berth.  We passed Kingston at midnight, and lost all our lady passengers  but two. The gale continued until daybreak, and noise and confusion  prevailed all night, which were greatly increased by the uproarious  conduct of a wild Irish emigrant, who thought fit to make his bed  upon the mat before the cabin door. He sang, he shouted, and  harangued his countrymen on the political state of the Emerald  Isle, in a style which was loud if not eloquent. Sleep was  impossible, whilst his stentorian lungs continued to pour forth  torrents of unmeaning sound.    Our Dutch stewardess was highly enraged. His conduct, she said,  \"was perfectly ondacent.\" She opened the door, and bestowing upon  him several kicks, bade him get away \"out of that,\" or she would  complain to the captain.    In answer to this remonstrance, he caught her by the foot, and  pulled her down. Then waving the tattered remains of his straw hat  in the"]]]
