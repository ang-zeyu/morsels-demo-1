With us, therefore, waterfowl are not passing pilgrims, tarrying for a  few days only as they rest and feed on their way to the open waters  and green pastures in which they intend to pass those months marked  winter on the calendar of the year. They are not mere hurrying flocks  alighting now and again as they wing their way back to their breeding  grounds in the spring But ours is the Mecca to which they journey;  ours the feeding grounds on which they assemble from the lakes and  marshes of the Arctic; from the whole chain of the Aleutian Islands;  from the inland seas of British Columbia and from the mountain lakes  of our own Sierras from Washington to Mexico. Here on the bays,  estuaries and marshes of the coast and the lakes and ponds of the  valleys, throughout the whole length of these hunting grounds,  countless millions of these birds have found their winter feeding  grounds for unnumbered ages. No cold, no ice, no snow, no howling  blizzards to stop them in their search for food or disturb their  midday rest upon our quiet waters. In warmth they feed upon the tender  shoots of the young grasses that fringe their watery haunts or bask in  sunshine on the sandy shores.    It is the popular impression that all ducks breed in the far north and  migrate from there south. One has only to shoot on the lakes of Mexico  to learn how erroneous this impression is, for one will meet varieties  quite common there that rarely if ever reach the southern boundaries  of the United States.    The masked duck (=Nomonyx dominicus=) is a purely southern species  reaching Mexico only in its breeding season. The three species of the  Mexican tree duck, quite common in that country, come but little into  the United States. One of these, the black-bellied tree duck  (=Dendrocygna autumnalis=) migrates to some little extent into Texas  and to less extent into New Mexico and Arizona. The fulvous tree duck  (=Dendrocygna fulva=) extends its migrations still farther north,  breeding to considerable extent in Arizona and southern California,  but rarely seen as far north as the center of the state. The other  species of the genus (=Dendrocygna elegans=), for which I know no  English name, is even rare as far south as southern Jalisco. The  cinnamon teal is a southern duck, breeding in Arizona, Texas and  southern California but so rarely seen north of San Francisco that a  gentleman who had killed a straggler near Marysville, when showing it  to me, said that he couldn't find a man in the town who could tell him  what it was. Yet the cinnamon teal is very common in Mexico and  Arizona and quite plentiful in southern California in the spring,  before the flocks break up and the birds seek their nesting places.    Northern bred ducks and purely northern species visit us in great  numbers during the winter months, and to these must be added the vast  number of these birds that breed in the mountains throughout our  hunting grounds.    The ornithologist divides the ducks into two subfamilies; the  fresh-water ducks forming the subfamily, =Anatinae=, and the salt-water  ducks the subfamily, =Fullgilinae=. These two families can easily be  distinguished by their feet. If a salt-water duck, the hind toe will  be found to have a small web or flap on the under side, but if the  bird belongs to the fresh-water group, the toe will be as clean as any  land bird.        [Illustration: MALLARD (Anas boschas)]      THE MALLARD    (Anas boschas)    The mallard is possibly the best known duck in America, it being found  in greater or less numbers everywhere from the Arctic to Central  America. It is a resident species throughout the Pacific Coast,  breeding on the mountain lakes and streams from Mexico to Alaska, and  even to a considerable extent on the lower marshes of California,  Oregon and Washington. On the fresh water ponds and overflows they  congregate in great numbers during the winter months and a bag limit  of twenty is no uncommon thing. Like all of the fresh-water ducks of  this Coast, they, too, are often found in considerable numbers on the  tide lands and salt marshes.    The mallard of the Pacific Coast can hardly be said to be a migratory  duck, for it breeds from Mexico north. Its migrations consisting more  of altitudinal movements than of longitudinal. While it breeds on the  mountain lakes of Mexico, it is rarely seen in the higher altitudes  during the winter months.    Hybrids between the mallard and the pin-tail and the mallard and the  widgeon have been occasionally met with on the marshes of the Coast.  This is most likely caused by the mating of cripples that had not the  strength to make the flight to their usual breeding grounds.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, dark green with a metallic luster;  white ring around the neck at the bottom of the green; back, gray;  breast, chestnut brown; under parts dirty white; tail, black with two  feathers curled upwards; speculum, (see diagram) purple, bordered with  black and white.    Female--Head, dark buff; breast, lighter buff with brown mottlings;  legs, orange colored; speculum same as the male; bill, yellow,  blotched with brown.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is placed on the ground and lined with  grass, feathers and down. The eggs number eight to a dozen and are of  a greenish tinge.    =Measurements=--Male--Total length, from 20 to 25 inches; wing, 10 to  12 inches; bill, 2-1/2 inches.    Female--Total length, from 18 to 20 inches; wing, 9 to 10 inches;  bill, 2 to 2-1/4 inches.        [Illustration: GADWALL (Anas strepera)]      THE GADWALL    (Anas strepera)    The gadwall was at one time quite plentiful on the shooting grounds of  California, south of San Francisco; but, on account of our season  opening later and closing earlier than in years past, few are killed  now. The gadwall is really a southern duck, coming into the United  States to breed. When the California season opened on the first of  September and closed the first of April, there were plenty of gadwall  found on its ponds in the early fall and late in the spring. Now, but  few are killed except in the southern part of the state. Such as are  killed are generally found on the mountain lakes and ponds of the  higher valleys. On the waters of Mexico and Lower California, however,  they are met with in good numbers.    The gadwall, however, migrates as far north as British Columbia for  breeding purposes as well as breeding on the mountain lakes of all the  territory through which it ranges.    =Color=--Male--Head, light brown, finely mottled with dark brown and  black; neck and breast, finely streaked with wavy black and white;  under parts, grayish white; rump and tail, black; speculum, black and  white, with the lesser wing-coverts chestnut; feet, orange, and bill  nearly white.    Female--Closely resembling the male but with very little chestnut on  the wings.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest which is usually made a little way back  from the water is lined with dead grass, and contains from ten to  twelve eggs of a light buff color.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 19 inches; wing, 10, and bill,  1.60.      [Illustration: WIDGEON (Anas americana)]      THE WIDGEON    (Anas Americana)    The widgeon is one of the most common ducks of the Coast, both north  and south. As well as being one of the most plentiful of the interior  lakes and ponds, they are found in great numbers on the salt marshes  and tide overflows, and even form great dark patches on the ocean as  they take their midday rest on its bosom a mile or so beyond the surf.  They breed on the mountain lakes and streams all along the Coast from  Mexico north.    The widgeon begins its migrations early in the fall and great numbers  find their way as far south as the Coast marshes and lower lakes of  Mexico. They feed largely on the plains and frequent the fields in  search of grain. In migrating or flying from pond to pond they usually  go in quite large flocks.    =Color=--Male--Head, pinkish white on top, with a greenish streak from  the eye back to the ociput; below this the head and neck are speckled  with black and white; back and wing-coverts, gray with fine markings  of black; breast, a light brick red with a purplish cast; speculum,  black and green. Axillars, white with dark shafts.    Female--The female resembles the male in all but the green on the head  and the reddish color of the breast.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is generally built in some tuft of grass or  thick weeds near some water's edge. The eggs average about a dozen and  are of very light brownish white.    =Measurements=--Total length, 18 inches; wing 9-1/2, and bill, 1-1/2.        [Illustration: GREEN-WINGED TEAL (Anas carolinensis)]      GREEN-WINGED TEAL    (Anas carolinensis)    The green-winged teal is another variety that is very plentiful on the  Coast, breeding in great numbers on our mountain lakes and along the  streams from Mexico to Alaska, and even to considerable extent on the  lower marshes, especially from central California north. While many of  these are killed on the salt marshes and tide lands, they are more  generally frequenters of the inland ponds and overflows. Nesting late  and maturing early, they are both a late and early duck on our  shooting grounds, and remain constantly with us during the whole  winter. Shooting on a pass over which the teal are flying from one  pond to another furnishes about the finest sport of the duck shooter's  life. In such cases they come in small flocks, and single birds must  be selected; being a small mark and very rapid flyers they require a  good lead and quick work. In fact, a brace of green-winged teal with a  pressing engagement at the next pond makes about as pretty a target as  the sportsman often fires at.    The green-winged teal, like the widgeon, feeds a great deal on the  plains and in the fields.    =Color=--Male-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#9)"],[1,"of a  winter's ramble. As long as the ground remains neither frozen nor  snowed up, the open meadows may be seen everywhere spotted with these  birds, but when the earth becomes so hard as to resist their efforts  in digging up worms and grubs, they repair to the cliffs which border  the sea-coast, where some sunny nook is generally to be found, to  woods in quest of berries, or to the watercourses of sheltered  valleys. At these times they are mostly silent, their only note, when  they utter any, being simple and harsh; but in France they are said to  sing towards the end of February, and even in this country they have  been known to perch on trees in mild weather, and execute a regular  song. Towards the end of April or beginning of May, they take their  departure northwards, where they pass the summer, preferring woods and  thickets in the vicinity of marshes. Mr. Hewitson states that while he  was travelling through Norway 'the Redwing was but seldom seen, and  then perched upon the summit of one of the highest trees, pouring  forth its delightfully wild note. It was always very shy, and upon  seeing our approach would drop suddenly from its height, and disappear  among the underwood. Its nest, which we twice found with young ones  (although our unceasing endeavours to find its eggs were fruitless),  was similar to that of the Fieldfare. The Redwing is called the  Nightingale of Norway, and well it deserves the name', and Turdus  IlA-acus because it frequented in such great numbers the environs of  Ilion-Troy.        THE FIELDFARE     TURDUS PILARIS        Head, nape, and lower part of the back dark ash colour; upper      part of the back and wing-coverts chestnut brown; lore black;      a white rim above the eyes; throat and breast yellowish red      with oblong dark spots; feathers on the flanks spotted with      black and edged with white; abdomen pure white without spots;      under wing-coverts white, beak brown, tipped with black.      Length ten inches, breadth seventeen inches. Eggs light blue,      mottled all over with dark red brown spots.    The Fieldfare is little inferior in size to the Missel Thrush, with  which, however, it is not likely to be confounded even at a distance,  owing to the predominant bluish tinge of its upper plumage. In the  west of England, where the Thrush is called the Grey-bird, to  distinguish it from its ally the Blackbird, the Fieldfare is known by  the name of Bluebird, to distinguish it from both. It is a migratory  bird, spending its summer, and breeding, in the north of Europe, and  paying us an annual visit in October or November. But it is impatient  of cold, even with us, for in winters of unusual severity it migrates  yet farther south, and drops in upon our meadows a second time in the  spring, when on its way to its summer quarters. Fieldfares are  eminently gregarious; not only do they arrive at our shores and depart  from them in flocks, but they keep together as long as they remain,  nor do they dissolve their society on their return to the north, but  build their nests many together in the same wood. In this country,  they are wild and cautious birds, resorting during open weather to  watercourses and damp pastures, where they feed on worms and insects,  and when frost sets in betaking themselves to bushes in quest of haws  and other berries; or in very severe weather resorting to the muddy or  sandy sea-shore. They frequent also commons on which the Juniper  abounds, the berries of this shrub affording them an abundant banquet.  Unlike the Blackbird and Thrush, they rarely seek for food under  hedges, but keep near the middle of fields, as if afraid of being  molested by some concealed enemy. When alarmed, they either take  refuge in the branches of a high tree in the neighbourhood, or remove  altogether to a distant field. The song of the Fieldfare I have never  heard: Toussenel doubts whether it has any; Yarrell describes it as  'soft and melodious'; Bechstein as 'a mere harsh disagreeable warble';  while a writer in the _Zoologist_ who heard one sing during the mild  January of 1846, in Devon, describes it as 'combining the melodious  whistle of the Blackbird with the powerful voice of the Mistle  Thrush'. Its call-note is short and harsh, and has in France given it  the provincial names of Tia-tia and Tchatcha. This latter name accords  with Macgillivray's mode of spelling its note, _yack chuck_, harsh  enough, no one will deny. 'Our attention was attracted by the harsh  cries of several birds which we at first supposed must be Shrikes, but  which afterwards proved to be Fieldfares. We were now delighted by the  discovery of several of their nests, and were surprised to find them  (so contrary to the habits of other species of the genus with which we  are acquainted) breeding in society. Their nests were at various  heights from the ground, from four to thirty or forty feet or upwards;  they were, for the most part, placed against the trunk of the Spruce  Fir; some were, however, at a considerable distance from it, upon the  upper surface and towards the smaller end of the thicker branches:  they resembled most nearly those of the Ring Ouzel; the outside is  composed of sticks and coarse grass and weeds gathered wet, matted  with a small quantity of clay, and lined with a thick bed of fine dry  grass: none of them yet contained more than three eggs, although we  afterwards found that five was more commonly the number than four, and  that even six was very frequent; they are very similar to those of the  Blackbird, and even more so to the Ring Ouzel. The Fieldfare is the  most abundant bird in Norway, and is generally diffused over that part  which we visited, building, as already noticed, in society; two  hundred nests or more being frequently seen within a very small  space.' Oddly enough two hundred was just the number of a colony of  nests in ThA1/4ringen on the estate of Baron von Berlepsch, which were  those of Fieldfares he had induced to come by trimming the trunks of a  long row of Black Poplar trees so as to afford good sites for the  nests. The present editor visited these in 1906. Some few instances  are on record of the Fieldfare breeding in this country, but these are  exceptional. In general they leave us in April and May, though they  have been observed as late as the beginning of June.        THE BLACKBIRD     TURDUS MERULA        _Male_--plumage wholly black; bill and orbits of the eyes      orange yellow; feet black. _Female_--upper plumage sooty      brown; throat pale brown with darker spots; breast reddish      brown passing into dark ash brown; bill and legs dusky. Length      ten inches; breadth sixteen inches. Eggs greenish grey,      spotted and speckled with light red brown.    With his glossy coat and yellow beak the Blackbird is a handsomer bird  than the Thrush; his food is much the same: he builds his nest in  similar places; he is a great glutton when gooseberries are ripe, and  his rich mellow song is highly inspiriting. But he is suspicious and  wary; however hard pressed he may be by hunger, you will rarely see  him hunting for food in the open field. He prefers the solitude and  privacy of 'the bush'. In a furze-brake, a coppice, a wooded  watercourse, or a thick hedgerow, he chooses his feeding ground, and  allows no sort of partnership. Approach his haunt, and if he simply  mistrusts you, he darts out flying close to the ground, pursues his  course some twenty yards and dips again into the thicket, issuing most  probably on the other side, and ceasing not until he has placed what  he considers a safe distance between himself and his enemy. But with  all his cunning he fails in prudence; it is not in his nature to steal  away silently. If he only suspects that all is not right, he utters  repeatedly a low cluck, which seems to say, 'This is no place for me,  I must be off'. But if he is positively alarmed, his loud vociferous  cry rings out like a bell, informing all whom it may concern that  'danger is at hand, and it behoves all who value their safety to fly'.  Most animals understand the cry in this sense, and catch the alarm.  Many a time has the deer-stalker been disappointed of a shot, who,  after traversing half a mile on his hands and knees between rocks and  shrubs, has just before the critical moment of action started some  ill-omened Blackbird. Out bursts the frantic alarum, heard at a great  distance; the intended victim catches the alarm, once snuffs the air  to discover in what direction the foe lies concealed, and bounds to a  place of security. A somewhat similar note, not, however, indicative  of terror, real or imagined, is uttered when the bird is about to  retire for the night, and this at all seasons of the year. He would  merit, therefore, the title of 'Bellman of the woods'. Neither of  these sounds is to be confounded with the true _song_ of the  Blackbird. This is a full, melodious, joyful carol, many of the notes  being remarkable for their flute-like tone--'the whistling of the  Blackbird'--and varying greatly in their order of repetition; though I  am inclined to believe that most birds of this kind have a favourite  passage, which they repeat at intervals many times during the same  performance.
