To which I       answered, that the mind of the episcopal clergy might, perhaps,       be; but, then, how happened it that they were always quarreling       and calling hard names about the sense of those very documents?       And so I left him, assuring him that living in the nineteenth       century, I wanted to hear the Church of the nineteenth century,       and no other; and should be most happy to listen to her, as       soon as she had made up her mind what to say.\"    English travellers in America give very minute accounts of the bad  grammar and questionable pronunciation they sometimes hear among our  common people: with what advantage they might go into the rural  neighborhoods of their own country for exhibitions in this line is shown  by the following description of a scene in a booth, which one of the  characters of Mr. Kingsley enters at night:         \"Sadder and sadder, Lancelot tried to listen to the       conversation of the men around him. To his astonishment he       hardly understood a word of it. It was half articulate, nasal,       guttural, made up almost entirely of vowels, like the speech of       savages. He had never before been struck with the significant       contrast between the sharp, clearly-defined articulation, the       vivid and varied tones of the gentleman, or even of the London       street-boy, when compared with the coarse, half-formed growls,       as of a company of seals, which he heard round him. That single       fact struck him perhaps more deeply than any; it connected       itself with many of physiological fancies; it was the parent of       many thoughts and plans of his after-life. Here and there he       could distinguish a half sentence. An old shrunken man opposite       him was drawing figures in the spilt beer with his pipestem,       and discoursing of the glorious times before the great war,       'when there was more food than there were mouths, and more work       than there hands.' 'Poor human nature,' thought Lancelot, as he       tried to follow one of those unintelligible discussions about       the relative prices of the loaf and the bushel of flour, which       ended, as usual, in more swearing and more quarreling, and more       beer to make it up: 'poor human nature! always looking back, as       the German sage says, to some fancied golden age, never looking       forward to the real one which is coming.\"    The descriptive powers of the author are illustrated in many fine  passages, of which this delineation of an English day in March will  serve as a specimen:         \"A silent, dim, distanceless, steaming, rotting day in March.       The last brown oak-leaf, which had stood out the winter's       frost, spun and quivered plump down, and then lay, as if       ashamed to have broken for a moment the ghastly stillness, like       an awkward guest at a great dumb dinner-party. A cold suck of       wind just proved its existence, by toothaches on the north side       of all faces. The spiders, having been weather-be-witched the       night before, had unanimously agreed to cover every brake and       brier with gossamer-cradles, and never a fly to be caught in       them; like Manchester cotton-spinners madly glutting the       markets in the teeth of 'no demand.' The steam crawled out of       the dank turf, and reeked off the flanks and nostrils of the       shivering horses, and clung with clammy paws to frosted hats       and dripping boughs. A soulless, skyless, catarrhal day, as if       that bustling dowager, old mother Earth--what with       match-making in spring, and _fetes champetres_ in summer, and       dinner-giving in autumn--was fairly worn out, and put to bed       with the influenza, under wet blankets and the cold-water       cure.\"    \"Yeast,\" says the _Spectator_, \"may be looked at as a series of  sketches, loosely strung together, descriptive of palpable social evils  in the mass, and of metaphysical broodings among the more thoughtful  youth; a struggle which perhaps is always taking place, and which is no  further distinctive of the present age than the form that is given by  our intellectual and religious activity. The origin of evil, its  presence in the world, what man was made for, what he struggles for,  what becomes of him, have been questions that excited the speculative of  all ages, taking various channels according to the circumstances of the  time. Considered from this point of view, as a life-like picture of the  heavings of the mass, and the mental fermentation going on among  individuals--of the _yeast_ of society--the book displays great ability,  and challenges careful attention. It is powerful, earnest, feeling, and  eloquent; the production of a man acquainted with society, who has  looked closely upon its various classes, and has the power of reading  the signs of the times. He has a truthful vigor of description, a  rhetorical rather than a dramatic power; or he sacrifices the latter to  his habit of expressing his opinions in dialogue, where the author talks  rather than the dramatis personae. There is a genial warmth of feeling in  the book, and wide human sympathies, but with a tendency to extremes in  statement and opinion--a disposition to deepen the shadows of English  life; for go where the author would, pictures quite as bad or worse may  be drawn of the condition of mankind, from the 'noble savage,' the beau  ideal of Rousseau, to the educated 'Prussian,' who was within a little  while the model man of a certain school of philosophers.\"          THE LITTLENESS OF A GREAT PEOPLE.      The future historians of this age will have to record no more mortifying  illustration of the difficulties which in a republic prevent the success  of great ideas than that which is presented in the case of Mr. Whitney,  who early in the last month sailed for England. We transcribe with  especial approval the following paragraphs respecting him and his  labors, from the _Tribune_:         \"If we are not mistaken, it is now nearly ten years since Mr.       Whitney first devoted himself to his great project, and he has       pursued it with a force of purpose, an intelligent apprehension       of all its bearings and consequences upon the world, a nobility       of ambition, and a sustained, intellectual enthusiasm which       belongs to the rarest and most admirable characters. We do not       know in any country a man in whom great intellectual and       practical elements are more happily combined. It is not with       the warm partiality of private friendship that we thus speak of       Mr. Whitney, for, like all men of ideas, and all of nature       positive and deep enough to have a special mission in the       world, he puts others into relation with the thoughts which       engage him rather than with his own personality, and you become       intimate with them, not with him. A native, as we believe, of       Connecticut, brought up to business in this city, where he       acquired a competence, having conceived the idea of a vaster       and more inspiring enterprise than the political and industrial       world had ever attempted, he quitted the pursuits of trade, and       the certain wealth they promised him, to perfect and realize       his conception. He studied the great routes of the world, and       the causes of their adoption. In a residence in Europe and by       voyages in the East he made himself acquainted with the facts       relating to the trade and productive capacities of Asia. He       thoroughly surveyed and mastered the whole subject before       beginning its discussion. Then he proposed the scheme to his       countrymen, and for many years has sought exclusively to       commend it to their favor. He has travelled in every direction,       addressing public bodies and meetings of citizens, writing       newspaper articles and pamphlets, and sparing no occasion to       bring the idea and the facts connected with it to the knowledge       of all. Wherever he has gone he has left some sparks of his own       genial enthusiasm. The plan has found advocates in every       section; many state legislatures have formally endorsed it, and       a large party in Congress have been in its favor. Dependent       altogether on his own pecuniary resources, Mr. Whitney, without       compensation or assistance, has labored with a constancy and       fidelity which could only proceed from a great purpose. But       after this period of arduous exertion he has failed to carry       his plan through Congress, while a great part of the lands on       which he must depend for its execution, have already passed       from the control of the federal Legislature. Accordingly,       though he would greatly prefer that his own country should reap       the splendid harvest of honor and substantial power which the       building of this world's highway would assure, he has no choice       but to consider the means which may be offered him for making       it through British America. To the world at large the       consequences would be the same, though to the United States       very different.         \"The route through British America is, in some respects, even       preferable to that through our own territory. By the former,       the distance from Europe to Asia is some thousand miles shorter       than by the latter. Passing close to the northern shore of Lake       Superior, traversing the watershed which divides the streams       flowing toward the Arctic Sea from those which have their exit       southward, and crossing the Rocky Mountains at an elevation       some three thousand, feet less than at the South Pass, the road       could here be constructed with comparative cheapness, and would       open up a region abounding in valuable timber and other natural       products, and admirably suited to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29270"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 2 (#9)"],[1,"of Morhange  and was compelled to retreat. This retreat left the flank of the First  Army gravely unprotected, and as a consequence this army was also  obliged to fall back. This rear-guard movement was accomplished over a  very difficult piece of country down to the Baccarat-Ban de  Sapt-Provenchere line, south of the Col du Bonhomme. It was found  necessary to abandon the Donon and the Col de Sapt.    The task committed to the Second Army, that of Lorraine under De  Castlenau, was to protect Nancy, then to transfer itself to the east,  advancing later to the north and attacking in a line parallel to that  taken by the First Army on the Dieuze-Chateau Salins front in the  general direction of Saarbruecken. Its mission was therefore at once both  offensive and defensive: to cover Nancy and continue toward the west the  attack of the First Army.    After having repulsed, August 10 and 11, 1914, the strong German attacks  in the region of Spincourt and of Chateau Salins the Second Army took  the offensive and went forward almost without stopping during four days  of uninterrupted fighting. Penetrating into Lorraine, which had been  annexed, it reached the right bank of the Selle, cut off Marsal and  Chateau Salins, and pushed forward in the direction of Morhange. The  enemy fell back; at Marsal he even left behind enormous quantities of  ammunition.    As a matter of fact, he fell back on positions that had been carefully  fortified in advance and whence his artillery could bombard at an almost  perfectly accurate range. August 20, 1914, made a violent counterattack  on the canal of Salines and Morhange in the Lake district. The immediate  vicinity of Metz furnished the German army with a vast quantity of heavy  artillery, which played a decisive role in the Battle of Morhange. The  French retreated, and during this rear-guard movement the frontier city  of Luneville was for some days occupied by the Germans.    Thus the First and Second Armies failed in their offensive and saw  themselves obliged to retreat, but their retreat was accomplished under  excellent circumstances, and the troops, after a couple of days of rest,  found themselves in a condition again to take the offensive. The First  Army gave energetic support to the Second Army, which was violently  attacked by the Germans in the second week of August. The German attack,  which was first arrayed against Nancy, turned more and more to the east.    The battle, at first waged in the Mortagne basin, was gradually extended  to the deep woods on the left bank of the Meurthe and on to Chipotte,  Nompatelize, etc. The battles that have been named the Battle of  Mortagne, the Battle of the Meurthe, the Battle of the Vosges, all waged  by the First Army, were extremely violent in the last week of August and  the first two weeks of September. These combats partly coincided with  the Battle of the Marne; they resulted, at the end of that battle, in  the German retreat. The Second Army renewed the offensive August 25,  1914; it decisively checked the march of the German army and commenced  to force it back.    The instructions issued to General de Castelnau directed him everywhere  to march forward and make direct attacks. The day of August 25, 1914,  was a successful day for the French; everywhere the Germans were  repulsed. From August 26 till September 2, 1914, the Second Army  continued its attacks.    At this point the commander in chief having need of important forces at  his center and at his right relieved the Second Army of much of its  strength. This did not prevent it from engaging in the great Battle of  Nancy and winning it. It was September 4, 1914, that this battle began  and it continued till the 11th, the army sustaining the incessant  assaults of the Germans on its entire front advanced from Grand  Couronne. The German emperor was personally present at this battle.  There was at Dieuze a regiment of white cuirassiers at whose head it was  his intention to make a triumphal entry into Nancy. Heavy German  artillery of every caliber made an enormous expenditure of ammunition;  on the Grand Mont d'Amance alone, one of the most important positions of  the Grand Couronne of Nancy, more than 30,000 howitzer shells were fired  in two days. The fights among the infantry were characterized on the  entire front by an alternation of failure and success, every point being  taken, lost and retaken at intervals.    The struggle attained to especial violence in the Champenoux Forest. On  September 5, 1914, the enemy won Maixe and Remereville, which they lost  again in the evening, but they were unable to dislodge the French from  the ridge east of the forest of Champenoux. The Mont d'Amance was  violently bombarded; a German brigade marched on Pont-a-Mousson. The  French retook Crevic and the Crevic Wood.    On the 7th the Germans directed on Ste. Genevieve, north of the Grand  Couronne, a very violent attack, which miscarried. Ste. Genevieve was  lost for a time, but it was retaken on the 8th; more than 2,000 Germans  lay dead on the ground. The same day the enemy threw themselves  furiously on the east front, the Mont d'Amance, and La Neuvelotte. South  of the Champenoux Forest the French were compelled to retire; they were  thrown back on the ridge west of the forest. On the 9th a new  bombardment of Mont d'Amance, a struggle of extreme violence, took place  on the ridge west of the forest of Champenoux, the French gaining  ground. General Castelnau decided to take the direct offensive, the  Germans giving signs of great fatigue. On the 12th they retired very  rapidly. They evacuated Luneville, a frontier town, where they left a  great quantity of arms and ammunition. The French began immediately to  pursue them, the Germans withdrawing everywhere over the frontier.          CHAPTER VII    SIEGE AND FALL OF NAMUR      When the Germans occupied Brussels on August 20, 1914, we observed that  corps after corps did not enter the city, but swept to the south. This  was Von Kluck's left wing moving to attack the Allies on the Sambre-Mons  front. The forces which passed through Brussels were Von Kluck's  center, advancing south by east to fall in line beside the right wing,  which had mainly passed between Brussels and Antwerp to the capture of  Bruges and Ghent. The whole line when re-formed on the French frontier  would stretch from Mons to the English Channel--the great right wing of  the German armies.    Meanwhile, Von Buelow's second army had advanced up the valley of the  Meuse, with its right sweeping the Hisbaye uplands. Some part of this  army may have been transported by rail from Montmedy. Its general  advance in columns was directed chiefly upon the Sambre crossings. As  Von Kluck's wide swing through Belgium covered a greater distance, Von  Buelow's army was expected to strike the Allies some twenty-four hours  earlier. Its march, therefore, was in the nature of an onrush.    But Von Buelow was now in the full tide of fighting strength--an amazing  spectacle to chance or enforced witnesses. Well may the terrified  peasants have stood hat in hand in the midst of their ruined villages.  Any door not left open was immediately broken down and the interior  searched. Here and there a soldier could be seen carrying a souvenir  from some wrecked chateau. But for the most part everyone fled from  before its path, leaving it silent and abandoned. The field gray-green  uniforms were almost invisible in cover, in a half light, or when  advancing through mist. No conceivable detail seemed to have been  overlooked. Each man carried a complete equipment down to handy trifles,  the whole weighed to the fraction of an ounce, in carefully estimated  proportions.    But this was not enough. Waiting for each column to pass were men with  buckets of drinking water, into which the soldiers dipped their aluminum  cups. Temporary field post offices were established in advance, so that  messages could be gathered in as the columns passed. Here and there were  men to offer biscuits and handfuls of prunes. In methodical,  machine-like progress came the ammunition wagons, commissariat carts,  field kitchens, teams of heavy horses attached to pontoons, traction  engines hauling enormous siege guns, motor plows for excavating  trenches, aeroplanes, carriages containing surgeons, automobiles for  the commanders, and motor busses in which staff officers could be seen  studying their maps. On some of these vehicles were chalked  Berlin-Paris. No branch of the service was absent, no serviceable part  if it overlooked--not even a complement of grave diggers. It moved  forward always at an even pace, as if on parade, with prearranged  signals passed down the line when there was any obstacle, a descent or  bend in the road.    The tramp of many thousands cast into the atmosphere clouds of fine  dust, but even those in rear marched through it as if their lungs were  made of steel. No permission was granted to open out for the circulation  of air, though it was the month of August. It is safe to assert there  was not a single straggler in Von Buelow's army. At the first sign of it  he was admonished with a vigor to deter his comrades. Discipline was  severely maintained. At every halt the click of heels, and rattle of  arms in salute went on down the line with the sharp delivery of orders.    On Wednesday, August 12, 1914, the town of Huy, situated midway between  Liege and Namur, was seized. It possessed an old citadel, but it was  disarmed, and used now only as a storehouse. Some Belgian detachments  offered a slight resistance at the bridge, but were speedily driven off.  The capture of Huy gave the Germans control of the railway from  Aix-la-Chapelle to France, though broken at Liege by the still standing  northern forts. But they secured a branch line of more immediate  service, running from Huy into Central Belgium.    On August 15, 1914, Von Buelow's vanguard came within"]]]
