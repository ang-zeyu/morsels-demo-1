(ll. 202-211) And now I will tell a fable for princes who themselves  understand. Thus said the hawk to the nightingale with speckled neck,  while he carried her high up among the clouds, gripped fast in his  talons, and she, pierced by his crooked talons, cried pitifully. To her  he spoke disdainfully: 'Miserable thing, why do you cry out? One far  stronger than you now holds you fast, and you must go wherever I take  you, songstress as you are. And if I please I will make my meal of you,  or let you go. He is a fool who tries to withstand the stronger, for he  does not get the mastery and suffers pain besides his shame.' So said  the swiftly flying hawk, the long-winged bird.    (ll. 212-224) But you, Perses, listen to right and do not foster  violence; for violence is bad for a poor man. Even the prosperous cannot  easily bear its burden, but is weighed down under it when he has fallen  into delusion. The better path is to go by on the other side towards  justice; for Justice beats Outrage when she comes at length to the end  of the race. But only when he has suffered does the fool learn this. For  Oath keeps pace with wrong judgements. There is a noise when Justice is  being dragged in the way where those who devour bribes and give sentence  with crooked judgements, take her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows  to the city and haunts of the people, weeping, and bringing mischief  to men, even to such as have driven her forth in that they did not deal  straightly with her.    (ll. 225-237) But they who give straight judgements to strangers and  to the men of the land, and go not aside from what is just, their city  flourishes, and the people prosper in it: Peace, the nurse of children,  is abroad in their land, and all-seeing Zeus never decrees cruel war  against them. Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true  justice; but light-heartedly they tend the fields which are all their  care. The earth bears them victual in plenty, and on the mountains the  oak bears acorns upon the top and bees in the midst. Their woolly sheep  are laden with fleeces; their women bear children like their parents.  They flourish continually with good things, and do not travel on ships,  for the grain-giving earth bears them fruit.    (ll. 238-247) But for those who practise violence and cruel deeds  far-seeing Zeus, the son of Cronos, ordains a punishment. Often even  a whole city suffers for a bad man who sins and devises presumptuous  deeds, and the son of Cronos lays great trouble upon the people, famine  and plague together, so that the men perish away, and their women do not  bear children, and their houses become few, through the contriving of  Olympian Zeus. And again, at another time, the son of Cronos either  destroys their wide army, or their walls, or else makes an end of their  ships on the sea.    (ll. 248-264) You princes, mark well this punishment you also; for the  deathless gods are near among men and mark all those who oppress their  fellows with crooked judgements, and reck not the anger of the gods. For  upon the bounteous earth Zeus has thrice ten thousand spirits, watchers  of mortal men, and these keep watch on judgements and deeds of wrong  as they roam, clothed in mist, all over the earth. And there is virgin  Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honoured and reverenced among  the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying  slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, and tells  him of men's wicked heart, until the people pay for the mad folly of  their princes who, evilly minded, pervert judgement and give sentence  crookedly. Keep watch against this, you princes, and make straight your  judgements, you who devour bribes; put crooked judgements altogether  from your thoughts.    (ll. 265-266) He does mischief to himself who does mischief to another,  and evil planned harms the plotter most.    (ll. 267-273) The eye of Zeus, seeing all and understanding all, beholds  these things too, if so he will, and fails not to mark what sort of  justice is this that the city keeps within it. Now, therefore, may  neither I myself be righteous among men, nor my son--for then it is  a bad thing to be righteous--if indeed the unrighteous shall have the  greater right. But I think that all-wise Zeus will not yet bring that to  pass.    (ll. 274-285) But you, Perses, lay up these things within your heart and  listen now to right, ceasing altogether to think of violence. For the  son of Cronos has ordained this law for men, that fishes and beasts and  winged fowls should devour one another, for right is not in them; but to  mankind he gave right which proves far the best. For whoever knows the  right and is ready to speak it, far-seeing Zeus gives him prosperity;  but whoever deliberately lies in his witness and forswears himself, and  so hurts Justice and sins beyond repair, that man's generation is left  obscure thereafter. But the generation of the man who swears truly is  better thenceforward.    (ll. 286-292) To you, foolish Perses, I will speak good sense. Badness  can be got easily and in shoals: the road to her is smooth, and she  lives very near us. But between us and Goodness the gods have placed the  sweat of our brows: long and steep is the path that leads to her, and it  is rough at the first; but when a man has reached the top, then is she  easy to reach, though before that she was hard.    (ll. 293-319) That man is altogether best who considers all things  himself and marks what will be better afterwards and at the end; and he,  again, is good who listens to a good adviser; but whoever neither  thinks for himself nor keeps in mind what another tells him, he is an  unprofitable man. But do you at any rate, always remembering my charge,  work, high-born Perses, that Hunger may hate you, and venerable Demeter  richly crowned may love you and fill your barn with food; for Hunger is  altogether a meet comrade for the sluggard. Both gods and men are angry  with a man who lives idle, for in nature he is like the stingless drones  who waste the labour of the bees, eating without working; but let it  be your care to order your work properly, that in the right season your  barns may be full of victual. Through work men grow rich in flocks  and substance, and working they are much better loved by the immortals  [1308]. Work is no disgrace: it is idleness which is a disgrace. But  if you work, the idle will soon envy you as you grow rich, for fame and  renown attend on wealth. And whatever be your lot, work is best for you,  if you turn your misguided mind away from other men's property to your  work and attend to your livelihood as I bid you. An evil shame is the  needy man's companion, shame which both greatly harms and prospers men:  shame is with poverty, but confidence with wealth.    (ll. 320-341) Wealth should not be seized: god-given wealth is much  better; for if a man take great wealth violently and perforce, or if he  steal it through his tongue, as often happens when gain deceives men's  sense and dishonour tramples down honour, the gods soon blot him out  and make that man's house low, and wealth attends him only for a little  time. Alike with him who does wrong to a suppliant or a guest, or who  goes up to his brother's bed and commits unnatural sin in lying with  his wife, or who infatuately offends against fatherless children, or who  abuses his old father at the cheerless threshold of old age and attacks  him with harsh words, truly Zeus himself is angry, and at the last  lays on him a heavy requittal for his evil doing. But do you turn your  foolish heart altogether away from these things, and, as far as you are  able, sacrifice to the deathless gods purely and cleanly, and burn  rich meats also, and at other times propitiate them with libations and  incense, both when you go to bed and when the holy light has come back,  that they may be gracious to you in heart and spirit, and so you may buy  another's holding and not another yours.    (ll. 342-351) Call your friend to a feast; but leave your enemy alone;  and especially call him who lives near you: for if any mischief  happen in the place, neighbours come ungirt, but kinsmen stay to gird  themselves [1309]. A bad neighbour is as great a plague as a good one  is a great blessing; he who enjoys a good neighbour has a precious  possession. Not even an ox would die but for a bad neighbour. Take  fair measure from your neighbour and pay him back fairly with the same  measure, or better, if you can; so that if you are in need afterwards,  you may find him sure.    (ll. 352-369) Do not get base gain: base gain is as bad as ruin. Be  friends with the friendly, and visit him who visits you. Give to one  who gives, but do not give to one who does not give. A man gives to the  free-handed, but no one gives to the close-fisted. Give is a good girl,  but Take is bad and she brings death. For the man who gives willingly,  even though he gives a great thing, rejoices in his gift and is glad  in heart; but whoever gives way to shamelessness and takes something  himself, even though it be a small thing, it freezes his heart. He who  adds to what he has, will keep off bright-eyed hunger; for if you add  only a little to a little and do this often, soon that little will  become great. What a man has by him at home does not trouble him: it is  better to have your stuff at home, for whatever is abroad may mean loss.  It is a good thing to draw on what you have; but it grieves your heart  to need something and not to have it, and I bid you mark this. Take  your fill when the cask is first opened and when it is nearly spent, but  midways be sparing: it is poor saving when you come to the lees.    (ll. 370-372) Let the wage promised to a friend be fixed; even with your  brother smile--and get a witness; for trust and mistrust, alike ruin  men.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#9)"],[1,"attribute  the attempted reform of the king of Tezcuco, Netzalhuatcoyotl (the  fasting coyote), who has been called the Mexican Solomon. He was a poet  and philosopher as well as king, and had no love either of idolatry or  of sanguinary sacrifices. He had a great pyramidal teocalli of nine  stages erected in his capital for the worship of the god of heaven, to  whom he brought no offerings except flowers and perfumes. He died in  1472, and, as far as we can see, his reformation made no progress. The  ever-increasing preponderance of the Aztecs was as unfavourable as  possible to this humane and spiritual tendency in religion.[15] Yet one  loves to dwell upon the fact, that even in the midst of a religion  steeped in blood, a protest was inspired by the sentiment of humanity,  linked, as it should always be, with the progress of religious thought.      III.    We must now proceed with our review of the Mexican deities, but I must  be content with indicating the most important amongst them; for without  admitting, with Gomara--who registered many names and epithets belonging  to one and the same divinity as indicating so many distinct  beings--that their number rose to two thousand, we find that the most  moderate estimate of the historians raises them to two hundred and  sixty. We shall confine ourselves, then, to the most significant.    The importance of rain in the regions of Mexico, so marked in the myths  we have already considered, prepares us to find amongst the great gods  the figure of Tlaloc, whose name signifies \"the nourisher,\" and who was  the god of rain. He was believed to reside in the mountains, whence he  sent the clouds. He was also the god of fecundity. Lightning and thunder  were amongst his attributes, and his character was no more amiable than  that of the Mexican deities in general. His cultus was extremely cruel.  Numbers of children were sacrificed to him. His statues were cut in a  greenish white stone, of the colour of water. In one hand he held a  sceptre, the symbol of lightning; in the other, a thunderbolt. He was a  cyclops; that is to say, he had but one eye, which shows that he must be  ultimately identified as an ancient personification of the rainy sky,  whose one eye is the sun. His huge mouth, garnished with crimson teeth,  was always open, to signify his greed and his sanguinary tastes. His  wife was _Chalchihuitlicue_, \"the lady Chalchihuit,\" whose name is  identical with that of a soft green jade stone that was much valued in  Mexico. Her numerous offspring, the Tlalocs, probably represent the  clouds. Side by side with the hideous sacrifices of which Tlaloc's  festival was the occasion, we may note the grotesque ceremony in which  his priests flung themselves pell-mell into a pond, imitating the action  and the note of frogs. This is but one of a thousand proofs that in the  rites intended to conciliate the nature-gods, it was thought well to  reproduce in mimicry the actions of those creatures who were supposed to  be their favourites or chosen servants. The frogs were manifestly loved  by the god of the waters, and to secure his good graces his priests, as  was but natural, transformed themselves into frogs likewise. It was with  this cultus especially that the symbol of the Mexican cross was  connected, as indicating the four points of the horizon from which the  wind might blow.    _Centeotl_ was another great deity, a kind of Mexican Ceres or Demeter.  She was the goddess of Agriculture, and very specially of maize. Indeed,  her name signifies \"maize-goddess,\" being derived from _centli_ (maize)  and _teotl_ (divine being). Sometimes, however, inasmuch as this goddess  had a son who bore the same name as herself, Centeotl stands for a male  deity. The female deity is often represented with a child in her arms,  like a Madonna. This child, who is no other than the maize itself, grows  up, becomes an adult god, and is the masculine Centeotl. The feminine  Centeotl, moreover, bears many other names, such as _Tonantzin_ (our  revered mother), _Cihuatcoatl_ (lady serpent), and very often _Toci_ or  _Tocitzin_ (our grandmother). She was sometimes represented in the form  of a frog, the symbol of the moistened earth, with a host of mouths or  breasts on her body. She had also a daughter, _Xilonen_, the young  maize-ear, corresponding to the Persephone or Kore of the Greeks. Her  face was painted yellow, the colour of the maize. Her character, at  least amongst the Aztecs, had nothing idyllic about it, and we shall  have to return presently to the frightful sacrifices which were  celebrated in her honour.    Next comes the god of Fire, _Xiuhtecutli_ (the Lord Fire), a very  ancient deity, as we see by one of his many surnames, _Huehueteotl_ (the  old god). He is represented naked, with his chin blackened, with a  head-dress of green feathers, carrying on his back a kind of serpent  with yellow feathers, thus combining the different fire colours. And  inasmuch as he looked across a disk of gold, called \"the looking-plate,\"  we may ask whether his primitive significance was not very closely  allied to that of Tezcatlipoca, the shining mirror of the cold season.  Sacrifice was offered to him daily. In every house the first libation  and the first morsel of bread were consecrated to him. And finally, as  an instance of the astounding resemblance that is forced upon our  attention between the religious development of the Old World and that of  the New, only conceive that in Mexico, as in ancient Iran and other  countries of Asia and Europe, the fire in every house must be  extinguished on a certain day in every year, and the priest of  Xiuhtecutli kindled fire anew by friction before the statue of his god.  You are aware that this rite, with which so many customs and  superstitions are connected, rests on the idea that Fire is a divine  being, of celestial and pure origin, which is shut up in the wood, and  which is contaminated in the long run by contact with men and with human  affairs. Hence it follows that in order for it to retain its virtues, to  continue to act as a purifier and to spread its blessings amongst men,  it must be brought down anew, from time to time, from its divine  source.[16]    The Aztecs also had a Venus, a goddess of Love, who bore the name of  _Tlazolteotl_ (the goddess of Sensuality).[17] At Tlascala she was known  by the more elegant name of _Xochiquetzal_ (the flowery plume). She  lived in heaven, in a beautiful garden, spinning and embroidering,  surrounded by dwarfs and buffoons, whom she kept for her amusement. We  hear of a battle of the gods of which she was the object. Though the  wife of Tlaloc, she was loved and carried off by Tezcatlipoca. This  probably gives us the clue to her mythic origin. She must have been the  aquatic vegetation of the marsh lands, possessed by the god of waters,  till the sun dries her up and she disappears. The legend about her is  not very edifying. It was she--to mention only a single feat--who  prevailed over the pious hermit Yappan, when he had victoriously  resisted all other temptations. After his fall he was changed into a  scorpion; and that is why the scorpion, full of wrath at the memory of  his fall and fleeing the daylight, is so poisonous and lives hidden  under stones.[18]    We have still to mention _Mixcoatl_, the cloud-serpent, whose name  survives to our day as the designation of water-spouts in Mexico, and  who was specially worshipped by the still almost savage populations of  the secluded mountain districts,--_Omacatl_, \"the double reed,\" a kind  of Momus, the god of good cheer, who may very well be a secondary form  of Tlaloc, and who avenged himself, when defrauded of due homage, by  interspersing hairs and other disagreeable objects amongst the  viands,--_Ixtlilton_, \"the brown,\" a sort of Esculapius, the healing  god, whose priest concocted a blackish liquid that passed as an  efficacious remedy for every kind of disease,--_Yacatecutli_, \"the lord  guide,\" the god of travellers and of commerce, whose ordinary symbol was  the stick with a carved handle carried by the Mexicans when on a  journey, who was sedulously worshipped by the commercial and middle  classes of Mexico, and in connection with whom we may note that every  Mexican, when travelling, would be careful to fix his stick in the  ground every evening and pay his respectful devotions to it,[19]--and,  finally, _Xipe_, \"the bald,\" or \"the flayed,\" the god of goldsmiths,  probably another form of Uitzilopochtli (whose festival coincided with  his), deriving his name apparently from the polishing process to which  gold (no doubt regarded as belonging to the substance of the sun) had to  undergo to give it the required brilliance, and to whose hideous cultus  we shall have to return in our next Lecture.    I must now be brief, and will only speak further of the _Tepitoton_,  that is to say, the \"little tiny ones,\" minute domestic idols, the  number of which was incalculable. They insensibly lower to the level of  animism and fetishism that religion which, as we have seen, bears  comparison in its grander aspects with the most renowned mythologies of  the ancient world. I must, however, allow myself a few words on the god  _Mictlan_, the Mexican Hades or Pluto. His name properly signifies  \"region of the North;\" but inasmuch as the North was regarded as the  country of mist, of barrenness and of death, his name easily passed into  the designation of the subterranean country of the dead. The Germanic  _Helle_ has a similar history, for it was first localized in the wintry  North and then carried underground. Mictlan, like Hades, was used as a  name alike for the sojourn and for the god of the dead. This deity had a  consort who bore divers names, and he also had at his command a number  of genii or servants, called _Tzitzimitles_, a sort of malicious demons  held in great dread by the living. Of course both Mictlan and his wives  "]]]
