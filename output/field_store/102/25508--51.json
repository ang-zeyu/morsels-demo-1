I have thought that the inner-self upon the surface both in words and  actions is necessary to the existence of an honest man. The conclusion  forces itself upon me in such a manner that I can not forbear expressing  it, and yet, if this be true, how few are strictly honest. But it is not  intended that this conclusion shall be applied beyond its proper limits;  that is to say, to those elements of thought which should, in  righteousness, be kept forever in the heart. But it is intended that the  remark shall be applied to all that is said and done. The surface man  should always find his prototype, or counterpart, in the inner-self,  otherwise there is a want of harmony between the outer and the  inner-self. This want of harmony is dishonesty; so dishonesty is always  hypocrisy. There is much more hypocrisy in the world than men are  accustomed to think.    What an immense distance there is between the inner and the outer self.  The distance is not always measured, for men often keep much in their  hearts that is not known by others, and which they themselves do not  counterfeit. In this we can not charge them with _necessary_ dishonesty.  Men may be dishonest in keeping a secret, but keeping a secret is not  necessarily dishonesty. The distance between the heart, the inner-self  and the outward-man, is very great, even as respects the secrets of the  heart which may be honestly kept as secrets, and it is certainly very  great as respects those secrets; which should not be kept as secrets.    It is a fact, so well known in our time that we need not argue the  question. There is a great deal of religion in the human heart which is  latent until some misfortune, that brings a man to a sense of his need  of help from a higher source, brings it to the surface.    It is true of dishonest men, who try to stultify their religious nature,  and make the world believe that they are genuine, honest infidels. I  very much doubt the honesty of every infidel known in our history.      Transcriber's Note    The punctuation and spelling from the original text have been faithfully  preserved.

A woman may  operate very well upon a man's imagination, but that will never help him  to make a living.    Let woman be, to all intents and purposes, the equal of man, trained for  the work of every-day life, for this is what the word education means.  Then throw open to her all the employments lying within her strength,  which are now monopolized by men, and let this new advantage work a  reformation in her education. What is her education even now, and in our  own country? Instead of being educated for health and long life, they  are trained in many instances for disease and a premature death. The  history of woman, as woman, is not in our reach; at least I am not  prepared to say it has been written. I wish it had, for I am persuaded  that woman has been the great redeeming element upon the human side of  bliss, without which our world could not exist.          *      *      *      *      *    \"And they charge that he (Thomas Paine) was a drunkard. That is another  falsehood. He drank liquor in his day, as did the preachers. It was no  unusual thing for the preacher going home to stop in a tavern and take a  drink of hot rum with a deacon, and it was no unusual thing for the  deacon to help the preacher home.\"--_Ingersoll._    Therefore, if a man stops at a hotel and drinks till he has to be helped  home, he is no drunkard? No! Ingersoll is a temperance man (?) and he  knows.          THE TESTIMONY OF AN INFIDEL IN WHOSE HEART EVERY SPARK OF TRUTH AND  JUSTICE WAS NOT EXTINGUISHED.      J.J. Rousseau says: The gospel, that divine book, the only one necessary  to a Christian, and the most useful of all to the man who may not be  one, only requires reflection upon it to impress the mind with love of  its author and resolution to fulfill his precepts. Virtue never spoke in  gentler terms; the profoundest wisdom was never uttered with greater  energy or more simplicity. It is impossible to rise from the reading of  it without feeling a moral improvement. Look at the books of the  philosophers with all their pomp, how little they are compared with  this. Shall we say that the history of the gospel is a pure fiction?  This is not the style of fiction, and the history of Socrates, which  nobody doubts, rests upon less evidence than that of Jesus Christ; and,  after all, this is but shifting the difficulty, not answering it. The  supposition that several persons had united to fabricate this book, is  more inconceivable than that one person should have supplied the subject  of it. The spirit which it breathes, the morality which it inculcates,  could never have been the invention of Jewish authors, and the gospel  possesses characters of truth so striking, so perfectly inimitable, that  the inventor would be a more astonishing object than the hero.--_J.J.  Rousseau, vol. 36, pp. 36, 39._          *      *      *      *      *    Have infidels been martyred on account of their infidelity? Men are not  so foolish as to have themselves devoured by wild beasts or perish in  slow fires rather than recant from a theory they never espoused, Col.  Ingersoll to the contrary, _notwithstanding_. Men do not prefer red-hot  iron chains to denying a Lord in whom they never believed. Infidels have  nothing to lose by recanting. Colonel Ingersoll says, \"I think I would.  There is not much of the martyr about me,\" _so we think of the Colonel_!          THE JEWISH RELIGION AND INSTITUTIONS KNOWN AMONG HEATHEN WRITERS.    BY HENRY KETT, B.D.,         _Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Oxford. Published first in       1812._      \"The transactions and literature of the ancient Jews were too remarkable  to escape the attention of the learned and inquisitive Pagans when Judea  became a province of the Roman Empire. Many particulars relative to the  eminent character of Joseph as a minister to Pharaoh, and as an inspired  prophet, to the emigration of the Jews from Egypt, their miraculous  passage through the Red Sea, their settlement in the Holy Land, the  institutions and ceremonies of the law, the splendor of Jerusalem in its  most flourishing times, the magnificence of the temple, and the supreme,  eternal and immutable nature of their worship, are related by Diodorus  Siculus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Tacitus and Justin.\"          CENTURIES BEFORE CHRIST.      The fragments of Sanchoniathon, the most ancient historian of Phenicia,  who is supposed to have flourished not long after the death of Moses,  confirms the Bible account of the origin of the world and of many men  and places mentioned in the Pentateuch. Berosus, the Chaldean, and  Manetho, the Egyptian, who lived in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus,  king of Egypt, represent several circumstances known in the accounts  given by Moses. They wrote about the time when the Old Testament was  translated into Greek. Their evidence, to say the least, shows the honor  that was paid by the most learned persons of the East to the records of  the Bible.          *      *      *      *      *    I know the Bible is inspired, because it finds me at greater depths of  my being than any other book.--_Coleridge._      Transcriber's Note    The punctuation and spelling from the original text have been faithfully  preserved.
