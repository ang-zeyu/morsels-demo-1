But, as we live in a system to which caloric has a very  strong adhesion, it follows that we are never able to obtain it in the  state of absolute freedom.    _Combined caloric_, is that which is fixed in bodies by affinity or  elective attraction, so as to form part of the substance of the body,  even part of its solidity.    By the expression _specific caloric_ of bodies, we understand the  respective quantities of caloric requisite for raising a number of  bodies of the same weight to an equal degree of temperature. This  proportional quantity of caloric depends upon the distance between the  constituent particles of bodies, and their greater or lesser degrees of  cohesion; and this distance, or rather the space or void resulting from  it, is, as I have already observed, called the _capacity of bodies for  containing caloric_.    _Heat_, considered as a sensation, or, in other words, sensible heat, is  only the effect produced upon our sentient organs, by the motion or  passage of caloric, disengaged from the surrounding bodies. In general,  we receive impressions only in consequence of motion, and we might  establish it as an axiom, _That_, WITHOUT MOTION, THERE IS NO SENSATION.  This general principle applies very accurately to the sensations of heat  and cold: When we touch a cold body, the caloric which always tends to  become in equilibrio in all bodies, passes from our hand into the body  we touch, which gives us the feeling or sensation of cold. The direct  contrary happens, when we touch a warm body, the caloric then passing  from the body into our hand, produces the sensation of heat. If the hand  and the body touched be of the same temperature, or very nearly so, we  receive no impression, either of heat or cold, because there is no  motion or passage of caloric; and thus no sensation can take place,  without some correspondent motion to occasion it.    When the thermometer rises, it shows, that free caloric is entering into  the surrounding bodies: The thermometer, which is one of these, receives  its share in proportion to its mass, and to the capacity which it  possesses for containing caloric. The change therefore which takes place  upon the thermometer, only announces a change of place of the caloric  in those bodies, of which the thermometer forms one part; it only  indicates the portion of caloric received, without being a measure of  the whole quantity disengaged, displaced, or absorbed.    The most simple and most exact method for determining this latter point,  is that described by Mr de la Place, in the Memoirs of the Academy, No.  1780, p. 364; a summary explanation of which will be found towards the  conclusion of this work. This method consists in placing a body, or a  combination of bodies, from which caloric is disengaging, in the midst  of a hollow sphere of ice; and the quantity of ice melted becomes an  exact measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged. It is possible, by  means of the apparatus which we have caused to be constructed upon this  plan, to determine, not as has been pretended, the capacity of bodies  for containing heat, but the ratio of the increase or diminution of  capacity produced by determinate degrees of temperature. It is easy with  the same apparatus, by means of divers combinations of experiments, to  determine the quantity of caloric requisite for converting solid  substances into liquids, and liquids into elastic aeriform fluids; and,  _vice versa_, what quantity of caloric escapes from elastic vapours in  changing to liquids, and what quantity escapes from liquids during their  conversion into solids. Perhaps, when experiments have been made with  sufficient accuracy, we may one day be able to determine the  proportional quantity of caloric, necessary for producing the several  species of gasses. I shall hereafter, in a separate chapter, give an  account of the principal results of such experiments as have been made  upon this head.    It remains, before finishing this article, to say a few words relative  to the cause of the elasticity of gasses, and of fluids in the state of  vapour. It is by no means difficult to perceive that this elasticity  depends upon that of caloric, which seems to be the most eminently  elastic body in nature. Nothing is more readily conceived, than that one  body should become elastic by entering into combination with another  body possessed of that quality. We must allow that this is only an  explanation of elasticity, by an assumption of elasticity, and that we  thus only remove the difficulty one step farther, and that the nature of  elasticity, and the reason for caloric being elastic, remains still  unexplained. Elasticity in the abstract is nothing more than that  quality of the particles of bodies by which they recede from each other  when forced together. This tendency in the particles of caloric to  separate, takes place even at considerable distances. We shall be  satisfied of this, when we consider that air is susceptible of  undergoing great compression, which supposes that its particles were  previously very distant from each other; for the power of approaching  together certainly supposes a previous distance, at least equal to the  degree of approach. Consequently, those particles of the air, which are  already considerably distant from each other, tend to separate still  farther. In fact, if we produce Boyle's vacuum in a large receiver, the  very last portion of air which remains spreads itself uniformly through  the whole capacity of the vessel, however large, fills it completely  throughout, and presses every where against its sides: We cannot,  however, explain this effect, without supposing that the particles make  an effort to separate themselves on every side, and we are quite  ignorant at what distance, or what degree of rarefaction, this effort  ceases to act.    Here, therefore, exists a true repulsion between the particles of  elastic fluids; at least, circumstances take place exactly as if such a  repulsion actually existed; and we have very good right to conclude,  that the particles of caloric mutually repel each other. When we are  once permitted to suppose this repelling force, the _rationale_ of the  formation of gasses, or aeriform fluids, becomes perfectly simple; tho'  we must, at the same time, allow, that it is extremely difficult to form  an accurate conception of this repulsive force acting upon very minute  particles placed at great distances from each other.    It is, perhaps, more natural to suppose, that the particles of caloric  have a stronger mutual attraction than those of any other substance, and  that these latter particles are forced asunder in consequence of this  superior attraction between the particles of the caloric, which forces  them between the particles of other bodies, that they may be able to  reunite with each other. We have somewhat analogous to this idea in the  phenomena which occur when a dry sponge is dipt into water: The sponge  swells; its particles separate from each other; and all its intervals  are filled up by the water. It is evident, that the sponge, in the act  of swelling, has acquired a greater capacity for containing water than  it had when dry. But we cannot certainly maintain, that the introduction  of water between the particles of the sponge has endowed them with a  repulsive power, which tends to separate them from each other; on the  contrary, the whole phenomena are produced by means of attractive  powers; and these are, _first_, The gravity of the water, and the power  which it exerts on every side, in common with all other fluids; _2dly_,  The force of attraction which takes place between the particles of the  water, causing them to unite together; _3dly_, The mutual attraction of  the particles of the sponge with each other; and, _lastly_, The  reciprocal attraction which exists between the particles of the sponge  and those of the water. It is easy to understand, that the explanation  of this fact depends upon properly appreciating the intensity of, and  connection between, these several powers. It is probable, that the  separation of the particles of bodies, occasioned by caloric, depends in  a similar manner upon a certain combination of different attractive  powers, which, in conformity with the imperfection of our knowledge, we  endeavour to express by saying, that caloric communicates a power of  repulsion to the particles of bodies.

It was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for George's  blood-curdling readings about \"Bar. falling,\" \"atmospheric disturbance,  passing in an oblique line over Southern Europe,\" and \"pressure  increasing,\" to very much upset us: and so, finding that he could not  make us wretched, and was only wasting his time, he sneaked the cigarette  that I had carefully rolled up for myself, and went.    Then Harris and I, having finished up the few things left on the table,  carted out our luggage on to the doorstep, and waited for a cab.                              [Picture: The luggage]    There seemed a good deal of luggage, when we put it all together.  There  was the Gladstone and the small hand-bag, and the two hampers, and a  large roll of rugs, and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes, and  a few umbrellas, and then there was a melon by itself in a bag, because  it was too bulky to go in anywhere, and a couple of pounds of grapes in  another bag, and a Japanese paper umbrella, and a frying pan, which,  being too long to pack, we had wrapped round with brown paper.    It did look a lot, and Harris and I began to feel rather ashamed of it,  though why we should be, I can't see.  No cab came by, but the street  boys did, and got interested in the show, apparently, and stopped.    Biggs's boy was the first to come round.  Biggs is our greengrocer, and  his chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned and  unprincipled errand-boys that civilisation has as yet produced.  If  anything more than usually villainous in the boy-line crops up in our  neighbourhood, we know that it is Biggs's latest.  I was told that, at  the time of the Great Coram Street murder, it was promptly concluded by  our street that Biggs's boy (for that period) was at the bottom of it,  and had he not been able, in reply to the severe cross-examination to  which he was subjected by No. 19, when he called there for orders the  morning after the crime (assisted by No. 21, who happened to be on the  step at the time), to prove a complete _alibi_, it would have gone hard  with him.  I didn't know Biggs's boy at that time, but, from what I have  seen of them since, I should not have attached much importance to that  _alibi_ myself.    Biggs's boy, as I have said, came round the corner.  He was evidently in  a great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision, but, on catching  sight of Harris and me, and Montmorency, and the things, he eased up and  stared.  Harris and I frowned at him.  This might have wounded a more  sensitive nature, but Biggs's boys are not, as a rule, touchy.  He came  to a dead stop, a yard from our step, and, leaning up against the  railings, and selecting a straw to chew, fixed us with his eye.  He  evidently meant to see this thing out.    In another moment, the grocer's boy passed on the opposite side of the  street.  Biggs's boy hailed him:    \"Hi! ground floor o' 42's a-moving.\"    The grocer's boy came across, and took up a position on the other side of  the step.  Then the young gentleman from the boot-shop stopped, and  joined Biggs's boy; while the empty-can superintendent from \"The Blue  Posts\" took up an independent position on the curb.    \"They ain't a-going to starve, are they?\" said the gentleman from the  boot-shop.    \"Ah! you'd want to take a thing or two with _you_,\" retorted \"The Blue  Posts,\" \"if you was a-going to cross the Atlantic in a small boat.\"    \"They ain't a-going to cross the Atlantic,\" struck in Biggs's boy;  \"they're a-going to find Stanley.\"    By this time, quite a small crowd had collected, and people were asking  each other what was the matter.  One party (the young and giddy portion  of the crowd) held that it was a wedding, and pointed out Harris as the  bridegroom; while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace  inclined to the idea that it was a funeral, and that I was probably the  corpse's brother.    At last, an empty cab turned up (it is a street where, as a rule, and  when they are not wanted, empty cabs pass at the rate of three a minute,  and hang about, and get in your way), and packing ourselves and our  belongings into it, and shooting out a couple of Montmorency's friends,  who had evidently sworn never to forsake him, we drove away amidst the  cheers of the crowd, Biggs's boy shying a carrot after us for luck.    We got to Waterloo at eleven, and asked where the eleven-five started  from.  Of course nobody knew; nobody at Waterloo ever does know where a  train is going to start from, or where a train when it does start is  going to, or anything about it.  The porter who took our things thought  it would go from number two platform, while another porter, with whom he  discussed the question, had heard a rumour that it would go from number  one.  The station-master, on the other hand, was convinced it would start  from the local.    To put an end to the matter, we went upstairs, and asked the traffic  superintendent, and he told us that he had just met a man, who said he  had seen it at number three platform.  We went to number three platform,  but the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was  the Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop.  But they were sure it  wasn't the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn't they  couldn't say.    Then our porter said he thought that must be it on the high-level  platform; said he thought he knew the train.  So we went to the  high-level platform, and saw the engine-driver, and asked him if he was  going to Kingston.  He said he couldn't say for certain of course, but  that he rather thought he was.  Anyhow, if he wasn't the 11.5 for  Kingston, he said he was pretty confident he was the 9.32 for Virginia  Water, or the 10 a.m. express for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in that  direction, and we should all know when we got there.  We slipped  half-a-crown into his hand, and begged him to be the 11.5 for Kingston.    \"Nobody will ever know, on this line,\" we said, \"what you are, or where  you're going.  You know the way, you slip off quietly and go to  Kingston.\"    \"Well, I don't know, gents,\" replied the noble fellow, \"but I suppose  _some_ train's got to go to Kingston; and I'll do it.  Gimme the  half-crown.\"    Thus we got to Kingston by the London and South-Western Railway.    We learnt, afterwards, that the train we had come by was really the  Exeter mail, and that they had spent hours at Waterloo, looking for it,  and nobody knew what had become of it.    Our boat was waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, and to it we  wended our way, and round it we stored our luggage, and into it we  stepped.    \"Are you all right, sir?\" said the man.    \"Right it is,\" we answered; and with Harris at the sculls and I at the  tiller-lines, and Montmorency, unhappy and deeply suspicious, in the  prow, out we shot on to the waters which, for a fortnight, were to be our  home.

Kingston.--Instructive remarks on early English history.--Instructive  observations on carved oak and life in general.--Sad case of Stivvings,  junior.--Musings on antiquity.--I forget that I am steering.--Interesting  result.--Hampton Court Maze.--Harris as a guide.    It was a glorious morning, late spring or early summer, as you care to  take it, when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a deeper  green; and the year seems like a fair young maid, trembling with strange,  wakening pulses on the brink of womanhood.    The quaint back streets of Kingston, where they came down to the water's  edge, looked quite picturesque in the flashing sunlight, the glinting  river with its drifting barges, the wooded towpath, the trim-kept villas  on the other side, Harris, in a red and orange blazer, grunting away at  the sculls, the distant glimpses of the grey old palace of the Tudors,  all made a sunny picture, so bright but calm, so full of life, and yet so  peaceful, that, early in the day though it was, I felt myself being  dreamily lulled off into a musing fit.    I mused on Kingston, or \"Kyningestun,\" as it was once called in the days  when Saxon \"kinges\" were crowned there.  Great Caesar crossed the river  there, and the Roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands.  Caesar,  like, in later years, Elizabeth, seems to have stopped everywhere: only  he was more respectable than good Queen Bess; he didn't put up at the  public-houses.    She was nuts on public-houses, was England's Virgin Queen.  There's  scarcely a pub. of any attractions within ten miles of London that she  does not seem to have looked in at, or stopped at, or slept at, some time  or other.  I wonder now, supposing Harris, say, turned over a new leaf,  and became a great and good man, and got to be Prime Minister, and died,  if they would put up signs over the public-houses that he had patronised:  \"Harris had a glass of bitter in this house;\" \"Harris had two of Scotch  cold here in the summer of '88;\" \"Harris was chucked from here in  December, 1886.\"    No, there would be too many of them!  It would be the houses that he had  never entered that would become famous.  \"Only house in South London that  Harris never had a drink in!\"  The people would flock to it to see what  could have been the matter with it.    How poor weak-minded King Edwy must have hated Kyningestun!  The"]]]
