The mosquito-bat gave a snort. \"Ship has lights. All modern  convenients.\"    Suddenly the air seemed to have grown chilly--colder than it had any  right to be on that torrid planet. All around them, it was dark and very  quiet.    \"I think I do see lights,\" Mortland said.    \"Must be ship,\" Monster replied. And somehow the rest of them could  sense the uneasiness in the thin, piping, alien voice. \"Must be!\"    \"Your ship's a very large one then,\" Bernardi commented as they rounded  a bend and a whole colony of varicolored pastel lights sprang up ahead  of them.    \"Not my ship!\" the mosquito-bat exclaimed in a voice pierced with  anguish. \"Not my ship!\"    Before them rose the fantastic, twisting, convoluting, turning spires of  a tall, marvelous, glittering city.    \"You will find that the streets actually are filled with chlorophyll,\"  the vine said. \"And I know you'll be happy here, all of you. You see, we  can't have you going back to your planets now. No matter how good your  intentions were, you'd destroy us. You do see that, don't you?\"    \"You may be right,\" Bernardi agreed dispiritedly, \"although that doesn't  cheer us any. But what will you do with us?\"    \"You'll be provided with living quarters comparable to those on your own  planets,\" the vine told him, \"and you'll give lectures just as if you  were in a university--only you'll be much more secure. I assure you--\"  its voice was very gentle now--\"you'll hardly know you're in a zoo.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31751"],[0,"What Bird is That? (#9)"],[1,"a black one and both with an            ivory-white bill. L. 20.              _Range._ Formerly southeastern United States to            North Carolina; now rare and local in the wilder,            less settled portions of the Gulf States.    When man appears, the Ivory-bill disappears. This is not alone due to  the destruction of the birds' haunts but to the bird's shy, retiring  nature. Its days are numbered even more surely than are those of the  forests it inhabits.    The nesting cavity is usually made in a cypress some forty feet from the  ground, and 3-5 white eggs are laid in March.      HAIRY WOODPECKER    _Dryobates villosus villosus. Case 2, Figs. 28, 29_              The Hairy is a large edition of the Downy with            white, unmarked outer tail-feathers. The male has            a red head-band. L. 9-1/2.              _Range._ Middle and northern states; a permanent            resident. The southern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v.            auduboni_) inhabits the southeastern United States            north to southern Virginia. It is smaller than the            Hairy and has less white in the plumage. L.            8-1/10.              The Northern Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. leucomelas_)            is found from the northern United States            northward. It is larger and whiter than the Hairy.            L. 10.              The Newfoundland Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v.            terraenovae_) is larger and darker than the Hairy;            it inhabits Newfoundland.              Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, rare P.R.            Cambridge, uncommon W.V., one summer record. N.            Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R.    The Hairy is not so common as his small cousin the Downy, and does not  so readily make friends. He prefers the woods to our orchards and is for  these reasons less often seen at our feeding-stands. The Hairy's notes  are noticeably louder than the Downy's. The nest-hole is usually in a  dead tree. The 2-4 white eggs are laid the last half of April.      DOWNY WOODPECKER    _Dryobates pubescens medianus. Case 2, Figs. 26, 27_              The Downy differs from the Hairy Woodpecker in            color by having the outer tail-feathers with black            bars, but it is the bird's obviously smaller size            that will serve to distinguish it. L. 6-3/4.              _Range._ From Virginia northward into Canada. A            Permanent Resident. The Southern Downy Woodpecker            (_D. p. pubescens_, Case 3, Fig. 25) is smaller,            darker below and with the white markings smaller.            L. 6. It inhabits the south Atlantic and Gulf            States north to North Carolina.              Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.            Cambridge, common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen            Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.    Our commonest Woodpecker; an alert, active little driller for insects  and their eggs and larvae, and frequent visitor to our lunch-counters,  particularly if we supply them with suet. His sharp _peek, peek_,  running at times into a diminishing string of _peeks_, and his rolling  tatoo, as he pounds a limb with amazing rapidity, are prominent parts of  every-day bird language, the tatoo being a 'song' of the breeding  season.    Four to six white eggs are laid in a hole, usually in a dead tree, the  first week in May. The Southern Downy nests in April.      RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER    _Dryobates borealis_              Between the Downy and Hairy in size (L. 8-1/2)            with a general resemblance to both, but the male            with a small tuft of red feathers on each _side_            of the back of the head.              _Range._ Southeastern States north to North            Carolina.    An inhabitant of the pine woods, who utters a coarse _yank-yank_ note  and may at times be seen feeding from the terminal tufts of pine  'needles' in the higher branches. The nest is usually in a living pine;  the 2-5 white eggs are laid in April.      ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER    _Picoides arcticus_              Two toes in front and one behind, a solid black            back and an orange-yellow crown in the male            distinguish this from all our other Woodpeckers.            Size of the Hairy, L. 9-1/2.              _Range._ Canada, and northern parts of our border            states, rarely south in winter, as far as Nebraska            and Ohio.              Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE.            Minn., rare.    An inhabitant of the spruce and balsam forests of our northern states,  occasionally straggling southward in winter. Nests in May.      THREE-TOED WOODPECKER    _Picoides americanus americanus_              Two toes in front and one behind, an orange-yellow            crest in the male, and a black back _closely and            evenly barred with white_ distinguish this bird;            it is somewhat smaller than the preceding, L.            8-3/4.              _Range._ Canada, south to the northern parts of            our boundary states; unknown south of            Massachusetts.    Not so common as the Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker, and less often found  south of its breeding range. Nests in early June.      YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER    _Sphyrapicus varius varius. Case 3, Fig. 26, Case 5, Fig. 30_              The female has the throat white, and rarely, crown            wholly black. Young birds have the throat whitish,            crown dull black, breast brownish. The black            breast-patch and red forehead, and red or white            throat are distinguishing characters. L. 8-1/2.              _Range._ Nests from northern New England and            Minnesota (in Alleghanies from North Carolina) to            Canada; winters from Pennsylvania (rarely)            southward to the Gulf States.              Washington, common T.V., Mch.-May; Sept. and Oct.,            Occasional in winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl.            5-May 13; Sept. 18-Oct. 23; casual in winter.            Cambridge, not uncommon T.V., Apl. and Sept.            15-Nov. 1; occasional W.V. N. Ohio, common T.V.,            Apl. 1-May 20; Sept. 15-Oct. 20. Glen Ellyn,            common T.V., Mch. 31-May 12; Sept. 14-Oct. 13. SE.            Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 19.    This is the mysterious maker of the rows of little holes drilled in even  lines, like hieroglyphics, on the trunks of apple and other trees. Using  his brush-tipped tongue as a swab, he drinks the sap that oozes from  these punctures.    As a migrant the Yellow-belly is not conspicuous. His business takes him  into the heart of living trees and he is usually seen only when flying  from one to another. His low 'snarling' note attracts the attention of  only the observant.    The nest-hole is 25-40 feet up; the 5-7 white eggs are laid in May.      PILEATED WOODPECKER    _Phloeotomus pileatus pileatus_              Next to the nearly extinct Ivory-bill this is the            largest of our Woodpeckers. (L. 17.) Both sexes            have a flaming red crest (reaching the forehead in            the male) the remainder of the plumage being            black, with the throat, a stripe from the bill            down the sides of the neck, and the basal half of            the wing-feathers white; bill horn-color.              _Range._ Southeastern and Gulf States, north to            North Carolina. The Northern Pileated Woodpecker            (_P. p. abieticola_) is found thence northward            into Canada and west to the Pacific. It is a            larger bird, with the white areas larger.    In the south the Pileated is by no means rare and seems not averse to  the presence of man; but in the north he retires to the wilder forested  areas and we are apt to see him only when we go a-camping. And he is  well worth seeing with his flaming crest and powerful bill which, used  either as a chisel or drum-stick, produces impressive results. Strangely  enough the Pileated's notes resemble those of the Flicker but are  louder.    The nest is usually well up; the 3-5 white eggs are laid in April in the  south, in May in the north.      RED-HEADED WOODPECKER    _Melanerpes erythrocephalus. Case 3, Figs. 21, 22; Case 6, Fig. 43_              Adults of both sexes have the whole head red;            young, during their first winter, have the head            grayish brown, and a black band across the white            wing-feathers. L. 9-3/4.              _Range._ Eastern United States, west to Rockies;            local east of the Alleghanies and north of            Pennsylvania.              Washington, rather common S.R., rare W.V.            Ossining, rare P.R., common in fall, Aug. 27-Oct.            12. Cambridge, irregular at all seasons; sometimes            common in fall. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl.            20-Sept. 25; occasionally winters. Glen Ellyn,            common S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 6; a few winter. SE.            Minn., common S.R., Apl. 4-Sept. 17; rare in            winter.    Adding to the normal habits of a Woodpecker marked skill as a  flycatcher, the Red-head stops his grub-hunting and swings out after a  passing insect with a dazzling display of red, white and blue-black.  Noisy as he is conspicuous, he beats his log-drum, rolls a tree  toad-like _krrring_, or, with tireless persistency utters a whistled  croak. In the northeastern states Red-heads are distributed irregularly.  They are rarely common in the summer, but in the fall they sometimes  appear in numbers. Whenever they come we are soon aware of their  presence.    The nest is generally in a dead tree; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in  May.      RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER    _Centurus carolinus. Case 3, Fig. 23_              Back and wings evenly barred with black and white,            hence the name 'Zebra'; the female and young have            the front part of the crown gray. L. 9-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern United States, north to"]]]
