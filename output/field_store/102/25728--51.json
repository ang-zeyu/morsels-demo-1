Now, what light does Theosophy throw on both these systems?  Theosophy enables every thinker to reconcile the partial  statements which are apparently so contradictory. Theosophy, with  the Vedanta, proclaims the universal Self. All that the Vedanta  says of the universal Self and the Self- limitation, Theosophy  repeats. We call these Self-limited selves Monads, and we say, as  the Vedantin says, that these Monads reproduce the nature of the  universal Self whose portions they are. And hence you find in  them the three qualities which you find in the Supreme. They are  units' and these represent the Purushas of the Samkhya; but with  a very great difference, for they are not passive watchers, but  active agents in the drama of the universe, although, being above  the fivefold universe, they are as spectators who pull the  strings of the players of the stage. The Monad takes to himself  from the universe of matter atoms which show out the qualities  corresponding to his three qualities, and in these he thinks, and  wills and acts. He takes to himself rhythmic combinations, and  shows his quality of cognition. He takes to himself combinations  that are mobile; through those he shows out his activity. He  takes the combinations that are inert, and shows out his quality  of bliss, as the will to be happy. Now notice the difference of  phrase and thought. In the Samkhya, Matter changed to reflect the  Spirit; in fact, the Spirit appropriates portions of Matter, and  through those expresses his own characteristics--an enormous  difference. He creates an actor for Self-expression, and this  actor is the \"spiritual man\" of the Theosophical teaching, the  spiritual Triad, the Atma-buddhi-manas, to whom we shall return  in a moment.    The Monad remains ever beyond the fivefold universe, and in that  sense is a spectator. He dwells beyond the five planes of matter.  Beyond the Atmic, or Akasic; beyond the Buddhic plane, the plane  of Vayu; beyond the mental plane, the plane of Agni; beyond the  astral plane, the plane of Varuna; beyond the physical plane, the  plane of Kubera. Beyond all these planes the Monad, the Self,  stands Self-conscious and Self-determined. He reigns in  changeless peace and lives in eternity. But as said above, he  appropriates matter. He takes to himself an atom of the Atmic  plane, and in that he, as it were, incorporates his will, and  that becomes Atma. He appropriates an atom of the Buddhic plane,  and reflects in that his aspect of cognition, and that becomes  buddhi. He appropriates an atom of the manasic plane and  embodies, as it were, his activity in it, and it becomes Manas.  Thus we get Atma, plus Buddhi, plus Manas. That triad is the  reflection in the fivefold universe of the Monad beyond the  fivefold universe. The terms of Theosophy can be easily  identified with those of other schools. The Monad of Theosophy is  the Jivatma of Indian philosophy, the Purusha of the Samkhya, the  particularised Self of the Vedanta. The threefold manifestation,  Atma-buddhi-manas, is the result of the Purusha's propinquity to  Prakriti, the subject of the Samkhyan philosophy, the Self  embodied in the highest sheaths, according to the Vedantic  teaching. In the one you have this Self and His sheaths, and in  the other the Subject, a reflection in matter of Purusha. Thus  you can readily see that you are dealing with the same concepts  but they are looked at from different standpoints. We are nearer  to the Vedanta than to the Samkhya, but if you know the  principles you can put the statements of the two philosophies in  their own niches and will not be confused. Learn the principles  and you can explain all the theories. That is the value of the  Theosophical teaching; it gives you the principles and leaves you  to study the philosophies, and you study them with a torch in  your hand instead of in the dark.    Now when we understand the nature of the spiritual man, or Triad,  what do we find with regard to all the manifestations of  consciousness? That they are duads, Spirit-Matter everywhere, on  every plane of our fivefold universe. If you are a scientist, you  will call it spiritualised Matter; if you are a metaphysician you  will call it materialised Spirit. Either phrase is equally true,  so long as you remember that both are always present in every  manifestation, that what you see is not the play of matter alone,  but the play of Spirit-Matter, inseparable through the period of  manifestation. Then, when you come, in reading an ancient book,  to the statement \"mind is material,\" you will not be confused;  you will know that the writer is only speaking on the Samkhyan  line, which speaks of Matter everywhere but always implies that  the Spirit is looking on, and that this presence makes the work  of Matter possible. You will not, when reading the constant  statement in Indian philosophies that \"mind is material,\" confuse  this with the opposite view of the materialist which says that  \"mind is the product of matter\"--a very different thing. Although  the Samkhyan may use materialistic terms, he always posits the  vivifying influence of Spirit, while the materialist makes Spirit  the product of Matter. Really a gulf divides them, although the  language they use may often be the same.          Mind        \"Yoga is the inhibition of the functions of the mind,\" says  Patanjali. The functions of the mind must be suppressed, and in  order that we may be able to follow out really what this means,  we must go more closely into what the Indian philosopher means by  the word \"mind\".    Mind, in the wide sense of the term, has three great properties  or qualities: cognition, desire or will, activity. Now Yoga is  not immediately concerned with all these three, but only with  one, cognition, the Samkhyan subject. But you cannot separate  cognition, as we have seen, completely from the others, because  consciousness is a unit, and although we are only concerned with  that part of consciousness which we specifically call cognition,  we cannot get cognition all by itself. Hence the Indian  psychologist investigating this property, cognition, divides it  up into three or, as the Vedanta says, into four (with all  submission, the Vedantin here makes a mistake). If you take up  any Vedantic book and read about mind, you will find a particular  word used for it which. translated, means \"internal organ\". This  antah-karana is the word always used where in English we use  \"mind\"; but it is only used in relation to cognition, not in  relation to activity and desire. It is said to be fourfold, being  made up of Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, and Chitta; but this fourfold  division is a very curious division. We know what Manas is, what  Buddhi is, what Ahamkara is, but what is this Chitta? What is  Chitta, outside Manas, Buddhi and Ahamkara? Ask anyone you like.  and record his answer; you will find that it is of the vaguest  kind. Let us try to analyse it for ourselves, and see whether  light will come upon it by using the Theosophic idea of a triplet  summed up in a fourth, that is not really a fourth, but the  summation of the three. Manas, Buddhi and Ahamkara are the three  different sides of a triangle,' which triangle is called Chitta.  The Chitta is not a fourth, but the sum of the three: Manas,  Buddhi and Ahamkara. This is the old idea of a trinity in unity.  Over and over again H. P. Blavatsky uses this summation as a  fourth to her triplets, for she follows the old methods. The  fourth, which sums up the three but is not other than they, makes  a unity out of their apparent diversity. Let us apply that to  Antahkarana.    Take cognition. Though in cognition that aspect of the Self is  predominant, yet it cannot exist absolutely alone, The whole Self  is there in every act of cognition. Similarly with the other two.  One cannot exist separate from the others. Where there is  cognition the other two are present, though subordinate to it.  The activity is there, the will is there. Let us think of  cognition as pure as it can be, turned on itself, reflected in  itself, and we have Buddhi, the pure reason, the very essence of  cognition; this in the universe is represented by Vishnu, the  sustaining wisdom of the universe. Now let us think of cognition  looking outwards, and as reflecting itself in activity, its  brother quality, and we have a mixture of cognition and activity  which is called Manas, the active mind; cognition reflected in  activity is Manas in man or Brahma, the creative mind, in the  universe. When cognition similarly reflects itself in will, then  it becomes Ahamkara, the \"I am I\" in man, represented by Mahadeva  in the universe. Thus wee have found within the limits of this  cognition a triple division, making up the internal organ or  Antahkarana--Manas, plus Buddhi, plus Ahamkara--and we can find  no fourth. What is then Chitta? It is the summation of the three,  the three taken together, the totality of the three. Because of  the old way of counting these things, you get this division of  Antahkarana into four.          The Mental Body        We must now deal with the mental body, which is taken as  equivalent to mind for practical purposes. The first thing for a  man to do in practical Yoga is to separate himself from the  mental body, to draw away from that into the sheath next above  it. And here remember what I said previously, that in Yoga the  Self is always the consciousness plus the vehicle from which the  consciousness is unable to separate itself. All that is above the  body you cannot leave is the Self for practical purposes, and  your first attempt must be to draw away from your mental body.  Under these conditions, Manas must be identified with the Self,  and the spiritual Triad, the Atma-buddhi-manas, is to be realised  as separate from the mental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#9)"],[1," property  from them? Had this gringo not always accepted their signatures as a  legal tender for the payment of their debts? Had he not told them time  and again that their handwriting was better than gold? If uncle had  fallen into the clutches of these furious people, he would undoubtedly  have been lynched. But he had wisely disposed of all his property in  the country and had left with his family for the States. I remained in  the service of the buyer of and successor to his business.    Soon after I began to feel lonesome, restless and dissatisfied, and  that life among the natives was not as pleasant and satisfactory as  formerly may be easily imagined. In fact, the gringos were now  cordially hated and envied by a certain class, the element of greatest  influence among the people. This produced a feeling of unpleasantness  not to be overcome, and I resolved to emigrate to California, overland,  by way of Arizona. I longed for the companionship of people of my own  race and wanted to see more of the world. There was an opportunity to  go to a mining town of northern Arizona, with several ox-teams which  were freighting provisions. The freighter, Don Juan Mestal, assured me  that he was very glad to have the pleasure and comfort of my company  and would not listen to an offer of remuneration on my part. He said  there was the choice of two routes; one road passed through the country  of the Navajo Indians and the other road led past Zuhl, the isolated  Pueblo village. Don Juan said that he would not go by way of Zuni, if  he could avoid it, as he was prejudiced against this tribe. Not that  they were hostile or dangerous, but he had acquired a positive  aversion, amounting to abhorrence, for those peaceful people when he,  as a boy, accompanied his father on a trading expedition there. At that  time he witnessed the revolting execution of a score of Navajos who had  been apprehended as spies by the Zunis. These unfortunates came to  their village as visiting guests, it being in the time of the harvest  of maize, when these Indians celebrate their great Thanksgiving feast.  A young Navajo chief, who led the visiting party, aroused the ire of  the old medicine chief of the tribe, who had lately added a new  attraction to his household, beshrewing himself with another lovely  young squaw. It was said that the enamored damsel had made preparations  to elope with the gallant Navajo chief, but was betrayed by the  telltale barking of the dogs, great numbers of which infest all Indian  villages. The old doctor accused the Navajos of espionage and had them  taken by surprise and imprisoned in an underground foul den. Then met  the chiefs of the tribe in their estufa, or secret meeting place, to  pass judgment on the culprits. The old medicine chief smoked himself  into a trance in order to receive special instructions from the great  Spirit regarding the degree of punishment to be inflicted on the  unlucky Navajos. After sleeping several hours, he awoke and announced  that he had dreamed the Navajos were to be clubbed to death. After  sunrise the next morning these poor Indians met their doom in the  public square of the village unflinchingly in the presence of the whole  population.    They were placed in a row, facing the sun, about ten feet apart. A Zuni  executioner, armed with a war club, was stationed in front of each  victim, and another one, armed likewise, stood behind him. A war chief  raised his arms and yelled, and forty clubs were raised in air. Then  the great war drum, or tombe, boomed out the knell of death. There was  a sickening, crashing thud, and twenty Navajos fell to earth with  crushed skulls, each cabeza having been whacked simultaneously, right  and left, fore and aft, by two stone clubs in the hands of a pair of  devils.    It had always been an enigma to me that the Pueblo Indians, who were  not to be matched as fighters against the Apache and Navajo had been  able to defend their villages against the onslaught of these fierce  tribes, their hereditary enemies. Don Juan Mestal enlightened me on  that topic. He said the explanation therefor was to be found in a  certain religious superstition of the Navajos and Apaches, which  circumstance the Pueblo Indians took advantage of and exploited to the  saving of their lives. When they had reason to expect an attack on  their villages, the Pueblo laid numerous mines and torpedoes on all the  approaches and streets of their towns. While these mines did not  possess the destructive power of dynamite or gunpowder, they were  equally effective and powerful, and never failed to repulse the enemy,  especially if reinforced by hand grenades of like ammunition, thrown by  squaws and pappooses from the flat roofs of their houses. By some means  or other it had become known to the descendants of Montezuma that when  an Apache stepped on something out of the ordinary \"he scented  mischief\" and believed himself unclean and befouled with dishonor, and  fancied himself disgraced before God and man; and forthwith he would  hie himself away to do penance at the shrine of the nearest water  sprite. This superstition they brought from Asia, their native land.    When the day of our departure drew near, I visited my numerous friends  to bid them farewell and receive many like wishes in return. I must own  that I felt a pang of sadness when I saw tears well up in the innocent  eyes of sweet maidens and saw the fires dimmed in the black orbs of  lovely matrons whom I had held often in my arms to the measure and  tuneful melody of the fantastic wild fandango; musical Andalusian  strains which words cannot describe--soul-stirring, enchanting,  promising and denying, plaintive or jubilant, songs from Heaven or  wails from the depths of Hades. Here I lived the happiest hours of my  life, but being young, I did not realize it then.    When I came to the house of Don Reyes Alvarado, who was my chum and  bosom friend, and also of like age, he gave me a pleasant surprise. He  informed me that there would be a dance at the Hancho Indian's  settlement that same night, one of those ceremonial events which I had  long desired to attend in order to study the customs and habits of  these descendants of the Aztecs. Their social dances are inspired by  ancient customs and are the outbursts of the dormant, barbaric rites of  a religion which these people were forced to abandon by their  conquering masters, the Spaniards. Outwardly and visibly Christians,  taught to observe the customs of the Roman Catholic Church and to  conform to its ritual, these people, who were the scum and overflow  from villages of Pueblo Indians, were yet Aztec heathens in the  consciousness of their souls and inclination of their hearts.    Shortly after sunset we were on our way to the sand dunes of the Rio  Grande, where these poor outcasts had squatted and built their humble  homes of terron, or sod, which they cut from the alkali-laden soil of  the vega. They held their dance orgies in the estufa, the meeting house  of the tribe. This was a long, low structure built of adobe, probably a  hundred feet long and nine feet wide, inside measure. The building was  so low that I could easily lay the palm of my uplifted hand against the  ceiling of the roof, which was made of beams of cottonwood, covered  with sticks off which the bark had been carefully peeled, the whole had  then been covered with clay a foot in depth. The floor of this long,  low tunnel-like room was made of mud which had been skilfully tampered  with an admixture of short cut straw and had been beaten into the  proper degree of hardness. Dampened at intervals, this floor was quite  serviceable to dance on. There were no windows or ventilators in this  hall and only one door at the end. This was made out of a slab of hewn  wood and was just high and wide enough to admit a good sized dog. The  hall was brilliantly lighted by a dozen mutton tallow dips, which were  distributed about the room in candelabra of tin, hanging on the  mud-plastered and whitewashed walls. The orchestra consisted of one  piece only, an ancient war drum, or tombe, and was located at the  farther end of the room. It was beaten by an Indian, who was, if  possible, more ancient than the drum. As we approached we heard the  muffled sound of the drum within. \"Caramba, amigo!\" said my friend;  \"they are at it already, and judging from the sound, they are very gay  to-night. Madre santissima! I remember that this is a great night for  these Indians, as it is the anniversary of the Noche Triste, which they  celebrate in commemoration of the Aztec's victory over the Spaniards  when the Indians almost wiped their enemies off the face of the earth.  Senor, to tell the truth, rather would I turn my horse's head homeward.  Pray, let us return!\" \"And why, amigo,\" I asked. \"Because this has  always been a day of ill luck for our family,\" said Don Reyes. \"It  began with the misfortune of the famed Knight Don Pedro Alvarado, the  bravest of men and the right hand of Don Fernando Cortez. In the bloody  retreat of the Spaniards from Mexico, in their fight with the Aztecs,  during the Noche Triste, Don Pedro Alvarado, from whom we were  descended, lost his mare through a deadly arrow. \"Muy bien, amigo Don  Reyes,\" said I; \"if you fear these people, I advise you to return home  to Dona Josefita, but I shall go on alone.\" \"I fear not man or beast!\"  flared up Don Reyes, \"as you well know, friend, but these are heathen  fiends, not human, who worship a huge rattlesnake, which they keep in  an underground den and feed with the innocent blood of Christian babes.  Lead on, senor, I shall follow. I see it is as Dona Josefita, my little  wife, says: \"If these young gringos crave a thing, there is no use in  denying them, for they seem to compel! To the very door of that uncanny  place I follow you, amigo, but enter therein I shall not, unless I be  first absolved from my sins and shriven by"]]]
