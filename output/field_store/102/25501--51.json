And since Mithridates of Pergamus, with  the forces he led against Egypt, was excluded from the avenues about  Pelusium, and was forced to stay at Asealon, he persuaded the Arabians,  among whom he had lived, to assist him, and came himself to him, at the  head of three thousand armed men. He also encouraged the men of power in  Syria to come to his assistance, as also of the inhabitants of Libanus,  Ptolemy, and Jamblicus, and another Ptolemy; by which means the cities  of that country came readily into this war; insomuch that Mithridates  ventured now, in dependence upon the additional strength that he had  gotten by Antipater, to march forward to Pelusium; and when they refused  him a passage through it, he besieged the city; in the attack of which  place Antipater principally signalized himself, for he brought down that  part of the wall which was over against him, and leaped first of all  into the city, with the men that were about him.    4. Thus was Pelusium taken. But still, as they were marching on, those  Egyptian Jews that inhabited the country called the country of Onias  stopped them. Then did Antipater not only persuade them not to stop  them, but to afford provisions for their army; on which account even  the people about Memphis would not fight against them, but of their  own accord joined Mithridates. Whereupon he went round about Delta, and  fought the rest of the Egyptians at a place called the Jews' Camp; nay,  when he was in danger in the battle with all his right wing, Antipater  wheeled about, and came along the bank of the river to him; for he  had beaten those that opposed him as he led the left wing. After which  success he fell upon those that pursued Mithridates, and slew a great  many of them, and pursued the remainder so far that he took their camp,  while he lost no more than fourscore of his own men; as Mithridates  lost, during the pursuit that was made after him, about eight hundred.  He was also himself saved unexpectedly, and became an unreproachable  witness to Caesar of the great actions of Antipater.    5. Whereupon Caesar encouraged Antipater to undertake other hazardous  enterprises for him, and that by giving him great commendations and  hopes of reward. In all which enterprises he readily exposed himself to  many dangers, and became a most courageous warrior; and had many wounds  almost all over his body, as demonstrations of his valor. And when  Caesar had settled the affairs of Egypt, and was returning into Syria  again, he gave him the privilege of a Roman citizen, and freedom from  taxes, and rendered him an object of admiration by the honors and marks  of friendship he bestowed upon him. On this account it was that he also  confirmed Hyrcanus in the high priesthood.              CHAPTER 10.           Caesar Makes Antipater Procurator Of Judea; As Does       Antipater Appoint Phasaelus To Be Governor Of Jerusalem, And       Herod Governor Of Galilee; Who, In Some Time, Was Called To       Answer For Himself [Before The Sanhedrim], Where He Is       Acquitted. Sextus Caesar Is Treacherously Killed By Bassus       And Is Succeeded By Marcus.    1. About this time it was that Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus,  came to Caesar, and became, in a surprising manner, the occasion of  Antipater's further advancement; for whereas he ought to have lamented  that his father appeared to have been poisoned on account of his  quarrels with Pompey, and to have complained of Scipio's barbarity  towards his brother, and not to mix any invidious passion when he  was suing for mercy; besides those things, he came before Caesar, and  accused Hyrcanus and Antipater, how they had driven him and his brethren  entirely out of their native country, and had acted in a great many  instances unjustly and extravagantly with relation to their nation; and  that as to the assistance they had sent him into Egypt, it was not done  out of good-will to him, but out of the fear they were in from former  quarrels, and in order to gain pardon for their friendship to [his  enemy] Pompey.    2. Hereupon Antipater threw away his garments, and showed the multitude  of the wounds he had, and said, that as to his good-will to Caesar, he  had no occasion to say a word, because his body cried aloud, though he  said nothing himself; that he wondered at Antigonus's boldness, while  he was himself no other than the son of an enemy to the Romans, and of  a fugitive, and had it by inheritance from his father to be fond of  innovations and seditions, that he should undertake to accuse other  men before the Roman governor, and endeavor to gain some advantages to  himself, when he ought to be contented that he was suffered to live;  for that the reason of his desire of governing public affairs was not so  much because he was in want of it, but because, if he could once obtain  the same, he might stir up a sedition among the Jews, and use what he  should gain from the Romans to the disservice of those that gave it him.    3. When Caesar heard this, he declared Hyrcanus to be the most worthy  of the high priesthood, and gave leave to Antipater to choose what  authority he pleased; but he left the determination of such dignity to  him that bestowed the dignity upon him; so he was constituted procurator  of all Judea, and obtained leave, moreover, to rebuild 12 those walls of  his country that had been thrown down. These honorary grants Caesar sent  orders to have engraved in the Capitol, that they might stand there as  indications of his own justice, and of the virtue of Antipater.    4. But as soon as Antipater had conducted Caesar out of Syria he  returned to Judea, and the first thing he did was to rebuild that wall  of his own country [Jerusalem] which Pompey had overthrown, and then to  go over the country, and to quiet the tumults that were therein; where  he partly threatened, and partly advised, every one, and told them  that in case they would submit to Hyrcanus, they would live happily and  peaceably, and enjoy what they possessed, and that with universal peace  and quietness; but that in case they hearkened to such as had some  frigid hopes by raising new troubles to get themselves some gain, they  should then find him to be their lord instead of their procurator; and  find Hyrcanus to be a tyrant instead of a king; and both the Romans and  Caesar to be their enemies, instead of rulers; for that they would not  suffer him to be removed from the government, whom they had made their  governor. And, at the same time that he said this, he settled the  affairs of the country by himself, because he saw that Hyrcanus was  inactive, and not fit to manage the affairs of the kingdom. So he  constituted his eldest son, Phasaelus, governor of Jerusalem, and of the  parts about it; he also sent his next son, Herod, who was very young, 13  with equal authority into Galilee.    5. Now Herod was an active man, and soon found proper materials for his  active spirit to work upon. As therefore he found that Hezekias, the  head of the robbers, ran over the neighboring parts of Syria with a  great band of men, he caught him and slew him, and many more of the  robbers with him; which exploit was chiefly grateful to the Syrians,  insomuch that hymns were sung in Herod's commendation, both in the  villages and in the cities, as having procured their quietness, and  having preserved what they possessed to them; on which occasion he  became acquainted with Sextus Caesar, a kinsman of the great Caesar,  and president of Syria. A just emulation of his glorious actions excited  Phasaelus also to imitate him. Accordingly, he procured the good-will of  the inhabitants of Jerusalem, by his own management of the city affairs,  and did not abuse his power in any disagreeable manner; whence it came  to pass that the nation paid Antipater the respects that were due only  to a king, and the honors they all yielded him were equal to the honors  due to an absolute lord; yet did he not abate any part of that good-will  or fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus.    6. However, he found it impossible to escape envy in such his  prosperity; for the glory of these young men affected even Hyrcanus  himself already privately, though he said nothing of it to any body; but  what he principally was grieved at was the great actions of Herod, and  that so many messengers came one before another, and informed him of the  great reputation he got in all his undertakings. There were also many  people in the royal palace itself who inflamed his envy at him; those, I  mean, who were obstructed in their designs by the prudence either of  the young men, or of Antipater. These men said, that by committing the  public affairs to the management of Antipater and of his sons, he  sat down with nothing but the bare name of a king, without any of its  authority; and they asked him how long he would so far mistake himself,  as to breed up kings against his own interest; for that they did not now  conceal their government of affairs any longer, but were plainly lords  of the nation, and had thrust him out of his authority; that this was  the case when Herod slew so many men without his giving him any command  to do it, either by word of mouth, or by his letter, and this in  contradiction to the law of the Jews; who therefore, in case he be not a  king, but a private man, still ought to come to his trial, and answer it  to him, and to the laws of his country, which do not permit any one to  be killed till he hath been condemned in judgment.    7. Now Hyrcanus was, by degrees, inflamed with these discourses, and at  length could bear no longer, but he summoned Herod to take his trial.  Accordingly, by his father's advice, and as soon as the affairs of  Galilee would give him leave, he came up to [Jerusalem], when he had  first placed garrisons in Galilee; however, he came with a sufficient  body of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#9)"],[1,"which they were both suffering  then, she could not so much as understand how she might be happy even in  heaven without them. And she had wept many nights through already, she  had passed many nights in prayer, imploring grace and mercy. But she  offered her suffering to God, and waited and trusted. And now, when  a new blow struck her, when the tyrant's command took from her a dear  one,--the one whom Aulus had called the light of their eyes,--she  trusted yet, believing that there was a power greater than Nero's and a  mercy mightier than his anger.    And she pressed the maiden's head to her bosom still more firmly. Lygia  dropped to her knees after a while, and, covering her eyes in the folds  of Pomponia's peplus, she remained thus a long time in silence; but when  she stood up again, some calmness was evident on her face.    \"I grieve for thee, mother, and for father and for my brother; but I  know that resistance is useless, and would destroy all of us. I promise  thee that in the house of Caesar I will never forget thy words.\"    Once more she threw her arms around Pomponia's neck; then both went out  to the oecus, and she took farewell of little Aulus, of the old Greek  their teacher, of the dressing-maid who had been her nurse, and of all  the slaves. One of these, a tall and broad-shouldered Lygian, called  Ursus in the house, who with other servants had in his time gone with  Lygia's mother and her to the camp of the Romans, fell now at her feet,  and then bent down to the knees of Pomponia, saying,--\"O domina! permit  me to go with my lady, to serve her and watch over her in the house of  Caesar.\"    \"Thou art not our servant, but Lygia's,\" answered Pomponia; \"but if they  admit thee through Caesar's doors, in what way wilt thou be able to watch  over her?\"    \"I know not, domina; I know only that iron breaks in my hands just as  wood does.\"    When Aulus, who came up at that moment, had heard what the question was,  not only did he not oppose the wishes of Ursus, but he declared that he  had not even the right to detain him. They were sending away Lygia as a  hostage whom Caesar had claimed, and they were obliged in the same way to  send her retinue, which passed with her to the control of Caesar. Here he  whispered to Pomponia that under the form of an escort she could add as  many slaves as she thought proper, for the centurion could not refuse to  receive them.    There was a certain comfort for Lygia in this. Pomponia also was glad  that she could surround her with servants of her own choice. Therefore,  besides Ursus, she appointed to her the old tire-woman, two maidens from  Cyprus well skilled in hair-dressing, and two German maidens for the  bath. Her choice fell exclusively on adherents of the new faith; Ursus,  too, had professed it for a number of years. Pomponia could count on the  faithfulness of those servants, and at the same time consoled herself  with the thought that soon grains of truth would be in Caesar's house.    She wrote a few words also, committing care over Lygia to Nero's  freedwoman, Acte. Pomponia had not seen her, it is true, at meetings of  confessors of the new faith; but she had heard from them that Acte had  never refused them a service, and that she read the letters of Paul of  Tarsus eagerly. It was known to her also that the young freedwoman lived  in melancholy, that she was a person different from all other women of  Nero's house, and that in general she was the good spirit of the palace.    Hasta engaged to deliver the letter himself to Acte. Considering it  natural that the daughter of a king should have a retinue of her own  servants, he did not raise the least difficulty in taking them to the  palace, but wondered rather that there should be so few. He begged  haste, however, fearing lest he might be suspected of want of zeal in  carrying out orders.    The moment of parting came. The eyes of Pomponia and Lygia were filled  with fresh tears; Aulus placed his hand on her head again, and after a  while the soldiers, followed by the cry of little Aulus, who in defence  of his sister threatened the centurion with his small fists, conducted  Lygia to Caesar's house.    The old general gave command to prepare his litter at once; meanwhile,  shutting himself up with Pomponia in the pinacotheca adjoining the oecus,  he said to her,--\"Listen to me, Pomponia. I will go to Caesar, though  I judge that my visit will be useless; and though Seneca's word means  nothing with Nero now, I will go also to Seneca. To-day Sophonius,  Tigellinus, Petronius, or Vatinius have more influence. As to Caesar,  perhaps he has never even heard of the Lygian people; and if he has  demanded the delivery of Lygia, the hostage, he has done so because some  one persuaded him to it,--it is easy to guess who could do that.\"    She raised her eyes to him quickly.    \"Is it Petronius?\"    \"It is.\"    A moment of silence followed; then the general continued,--\"See what it  is to admit over the threshold any of those people without conscience or  honor. Cursed be the moment in which Vinicius entered our house, for  he brought Petronius. Woe to Lygia, since those men are not seeking a  hostage, but a concubine.\"    And his speech became more hissing than usual, because of helpless rage  and of sorrow for his adopted daughter. He struggled with himself some  time, and only his clenched fists showed how severe was the struggle  within him.    \"I have revered the gods so far,\" said he; \"but at this moment I think  that not they are over the world, but one mad, malicious monster named  Nero.\"    \"Aulus,\" said Pomponia. \"Nero is only a handful of rotten dust before  God.\"    But Aulus began to walk with long steps over the mosaic of the  pinacotheca. In his life there had been great deeds, but no great  misfortunes; hence he was unused to them. The old soldier had grown more  attached to Lygia than he himself had been aware of, and now he could  not be reconciled to the thought that he had lost her. Besides, he felt  humiliated. A hand was weighing on him which he despised, and at the  same time he felt that before its power his power was as nothing.    But when at last he stifled in himself the anger which disturbed his  thoughts, he said,--\"I judge that Petronius has not taken her from  us for Caesar, since he would not offend Poppaea. Therefore he took her  either for himself or Vinicius. Today I will discover this.\"    And after a while the litter bore him in the direction of the Palatine.  Pomponia, when left alone, went to little Aulus, who did not cease  crying for his sister, or threatening Caesar.          Chapter V      AULUS had judged rightly that he would not be admitted to Nero's  presence. They told him that Caesar was occupied in singing with the  lute-player, Terpnos, and that in general he did not receive those whom  he himself had not summoned. In other words, that Aulus must not attempt  in future to see him.    Seneca, though ill with a fever, received the old general with due  honor; but when he had heard what the question was, he laughed bitterly,  and said,--\"I can render thee only one service, noble Plautius, not to  show Caesar at any time that my heart feels thy pain, or that I should  like to aid thee; for should Caesar have the least suspicion on this  head, know that he would not give thee back Lygia, though for no other  reason than to spite me.\"    He did not advise him, either, to go to Tigellinus or Vatinius or  Vitelius. It might be possible to do something with them through money;  perhaps, also, they would like to do evil to Petronius, whose influence  they were trying to undermine, but most likely they would disclose  before Nero how dear Lygia was to Plautius, and then Nero would all the  more resolve not to yield her to him. Here the old sage began to speak  with a biting irony, which he turned against himself: \"Thou hast been  silent, Plautius, thou hast been silent for whole years, and Caesar does  not like those who are silent. How couldst thou help being carried  away by his beauty, his virtue, his singing, his declamation, his  chariot-driving, and his verses? Why didst thou not glorify the death  of Britannicus, and repeat panegyrics in honor of the mother-slayer,  and not offer congratulations after the stifling of Octavia? Thou art  lacking in foresight, Aulus, which we who live happily at the court  possess in proper measure.\"    Thus speaking, he raised a goblet which he carried at his belt, took  water from a fountain at the impluvium, freshened his burning lips, and  continued,--\"Ah, Nero has a grateful heart. He loves thee because thou  hast served Rome and glorified its name at the ends of the earth; he  loves me because I was his master in youth. Therefore, seest thou, I  know that this water is not poisoned, and I drink it in peace. Wine in  my own house would be less reliable. If thou art thirsty, drink boldly  of this water. The aqueducts bring it from beyond the Alban hills, and  any one wishing to poison it would have to poison every fountain in  Rome. As thou seest, it is possible yet to be safe in this world and to  have a quiet old age. I am sick, it is true, but rather in soul than in  body.\"    This was true. Seneca lacked the strength of soul which Cornutus  possessed, for example, or Thrasea; hence his life was a series of  concessions to crime. He felt this himself; he understood that an  adherent of the principles of Zeno, of Citium, should go by another  road, and he suffered more from that cause than from the fear of death  itself.    But the general interrupted these reflections full of grief.    \"Noble Annaeus,\" said he, \"I know how Caesar rewarded thee for the care  with which thou didst surround his years of youth. But the author of  the removal of Lygia is Petronius. Indicate to me a method against him,  indicate the influences to which he yields, and use besides with him all  the eloquence with which friendship for"]]]
