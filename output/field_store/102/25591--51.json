The BROWN or BLACK BEAR.--_Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--This species,  like the rest of the family, is a solitary animal; for he only remains  associated with his mate for a short period, and then retires to his  winter retreat, which is usually in the hole of a rock, the cavity of a  tree, or a pit in the earth, which the animal frequently digs for  himself. He sometimes constructs a kind of hut, composed of the  branches of trees, which he lines with moss. In these situations he  continues, for the most part, in a lethargic state, taking no food, but  subsisting entirely on the absorption of the fat which he has  accumulated in the course of the summer.    The modes that are adopted, by the inhabitants of different countries,  for taking or destroying bears, are various. Of these, the following  appear to be the most remarkable: In consequence of the well-known  partiality of these animals for honey, the Russians sometimes fix to  those trees where bees are hived a heavy log of wood, at the end of a  long string. When the unwieldy creature climbs up, to get at the hive,  he finds himself interrupted by the log; he pushes it aside, and  attempts to pass it; but, in returning, it hits him such a blow, that,  in a rage, he flings it from him with greater force, which makes it  return with increased violence; and he sometimes continues this, till  he is either killed, or falls from the tree.    In Lapland, hunting the bear is often undertaken by a single man, who,  having discovered the retreat of the animal, takes his dog along with  him, and advances towards the spot. The jaws are tied round with a  cord, to prevent his barking; and the man holds the other end of this  cord in his hand. As soon as the dog smells the bear, he begins to show  signs of uneasiness, and, by dragging at the cord, informs his master  that the object of his pursuit is at no great distance.    When the Laplander, by this means, discovers on which side the bear is  stationed, he advances in such a direction that the wind may blow from  the bear to him, and not the contrary; for otherwise, the animal would,  by his scent, be aware of his approach, though not able to see the  enemy, being blinded by sunshine. The olfactory organs of the bear are  exquisite. When the hunter has advanced to within gunshot of the bear,  he fires upon him; and this is very easily accomplished in autumn, as  he is then more fearless, and is constantly prowling about for berries  of different kinds, on which he feeds at this season of the year.  Should the man chance to miss his aim, the furious beast will directly  turn upon him in a rage, and the little Laplander is obliged to take to  his heels with all possible speed, leaving his knapsack behind him on  the spot. The bear, coming up to this, seizes upon it, biting and  tearing it into a thousand pieces. While he is thus venting his fury,  the Laplander, who is generally a good marksman, reloads his gun, and  usually destroys him at the second shot; if not, the bear in most cases  runs away.    Bear-baiting was a favorite amusement of our English ancestors. Sir  Thomas Pope entertained Queen Mary and the Princess Elizabeth, at  Hatfield, with a grand exhibition of a \"bear-baiting, with which their  highnesses were right well content.\" Bear-baiting was part of the  amusement of Elizabeth, among \"the princely pleasures of Kenilworth  Castle.\" Rowland White, speaking of the queen, then in her  sixty-seventh year, says,--\"Her majesty is very well. This day she  appoints a Frenchman to do feats upon a rope, in the Conduit Court.  To-morrow she has commanded the bears, the bull, and the ape, to be  bayted, in the tilt-yard. Upon Wednesday, she will have solemn  dauncing.\" The office of chief master of the bear was held under the  crown, with a salary of 16d. _per diem_. Whenever the king chose to  entertain himself or his visitors with this sport, it was the duty of  the master to provide bears and dogs, and to superintend the baiting;  and he was invested with unlimited authority to issue commissions, and  to send his officers into every county in England, who were empowered  to seize and take away any bears, bulls, or dogs, that they thought  meet, for his majesty's service. The latest record, by which this  diversion was publicly authorized, is a grant to Sir Saunders Duncombe,  October 11, 1561, \"for the sole practice and profit of the fighting and  combating of wild and domestic beasts, within the realm of England, for  the space of fourteen years.\" Occasional exhibitions of this kind were  continued till about the middle of the eighteenth century.    We are told, in Johnston's _Sketches of India_, that \"bears will often  continue on the road, in front of a palanquin, for a mile or two,  tumbling, and playing all sorts of antics, as if they were taught to do  so. I believe it is their natural disposition; for they certainly are  the most amusing creatures imaginable, in a wild state. It is no wonder  they are led about with monkeys, to amuse mankind. It is astonishing,  as well as ludicrous, to see them climb rocks, and tumble, or rather  roll, down precipices. If they are attacked by a person on horseback,  they stand erect on their hind legs, showing a fine set of white teeth,  and make a crackling kind of noise. If the horse comes near them, they  try to catch him by the legs; and, if they miss him, they tumble over  and over several times. They are easily speared by a person mounted on  horseback, that is bold enough to go near them.\"    Bears ascend trees with great facility. Of their fondness for climbing,  we have the following curious instance: In the end of June, 1825, a  tame bear took a notion of climbing up the scaffolding placed round a  brick stalk, erecting by Mr. G. Johnstone, at St. Rollox. He began to  ascend very steadily, cautiously examining, as he went along, the  various joists, to see if they were secure. He at length, to the  infinite amusement and astonishment of the workmen, reached the summit  of the scaffolding, one hundred and twenty feet high. Bruin had no  sooner attained the object of his wishes, than his physiognomy  exhibited great self-gratulation; and he looked about him with much  complacency, and inspected the building operations going on. The  workmen were much amused with their novel visitor, and every mark of  civility and attention was shown him; which he very condescendingly  returned, by good-humoredly presenting them with a shake of his paw. A  lime bucket was now hoisted, in order to lower him down; and the  workmen, with all due courtesy, were going to assist him into it; but  he declined their attentions, and preferred returning in the manner he  had gone up. He afterwards repeated his adventurous visit.    \"Bears,\" says Mr. Lloyd, \"are not unfrequently domesticated in  Wermeland. I heard of one that was so tame, that his master, a peasant,  used occasionally to cause him to stand at the back of his sledge when  on a journey; but the fellow kept so good a balance, that it was next  to impossible to upset him. When the vehicle went on one side, bruin  threw his weight the other way, and _vice versa_. One day, however, the  peasant amused himself by driving over the very worst ground he could  find, with the intention, if possible, of throwing the bear off his  equilibrium, by which, at last, the animal got so irritated, that he  fetched his master, who was in advance of him, a tremendous thwack on  the shoulders with his paw. This frightened the man so much, that he  caused the beast to be killed immediately.\"    Of the ferocity of the bear there are many instances on record. A brown  bear, which was presented to his late majesty, George III., while  Prince of Wales, was kept in the Tower. By the carelessness of the  servant, the door of the den was left open; and the keeper's wife  happening to go across the court at the same time, the animal flew out,  seized the woman, threw her down, and fastened upon her neck, which he  bit; and without offering any further violence, lay upon her, sucking  the blood out of the wound. Resistance was in vain, as it only served  to irritate the brute; and she must inevitably have perished, had not  her husband luckily discovered her situation. By a sudden blow, he  obliged the bear to quit his hold, and retire to his den, which he did  with great reluctance, and not without making a second attempt to come  at the woman, who was almost dead, through fear and loss of blood. It  is somewhat remarkable, that, whenever he happened to see her  afterwards, he growled, and made most violent struggles to get at her.  The prince, upon hearing of the circumstance, ordered the bear to be  killed.    But the bear is also capable of generous attachment. Leopold, Duke of  Lorraine, had a bear called Marco, of the sagacity and sensibility of  which we have the following remarkable instance: During the winter of  1709, a Savoyard boy, ready to perish with cold in a barn, in which he  had been put by a good woman, with some more of his companions, thought  proper to enter Marco's hut, without reflecting on the danger which he  ran in exposing himself to the mercy of the animal which occupied it.  Marco, however, instead of doing any injury to the child, took him  between his paws, and warmed him by pressing him to his breast, until  next morning, when he suffered him to depart, to ramble about the city.  The young Savoyard returned in the evening to the hut, and was received  with the same affection. For several days he had no other retreat; and  it added not a little to his joy, to perceive that the bear regularly  reserved part of his food for him. A number of days passed in this  manner without the servants' knowing any thing of the circumstance. At  length, when one of them came to bring the bear its supper, rather  later than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#9)"],[1," virtually all of the animals were presumably in the    timbered area to the southward. None was sighted from the plane    during the flight to Churchill on December 4.      On November 7 the temperature had taken a sharp downward turn,    dropping below zero for the first time that season; and it did    not again rise above 6.5° till November 12. This cold spell,    combined with a snow blizzard from the north on the 6th and 7th,    coincided at least in part with the large migratory movement    noted above, and it may have been the stimulus for it.      The general weather conditions that obtained from November 12 on    may be summarized as follows. It was at least predominantly    cloudy on all but four or five days. There was snowfall on six    days, and drifting snow in the air on several other days. The    winds were predominantly north, northwest, and west; less    commonly, east and southeast. They were a little more frequently    light than moderate or brisk. The extremes of temperature during    this period were 22.5° and -23°; the average daily mean,    approximately 1°. There was an average of probably at least 8    inches of snow on the ground, with deeper drifts. The river was    not wholly frozen over at least up to the end of November.      _Retrograde autumnal movement_    It would doubtless be difficult to find, among other animals, any exact  parallel to this curious feature of caribou migration. According to  Charles Schweder, it takes place in the Nueltin Lake region in  September--sometimes as early as the first of the month. Herds up to 200  strong may then be seen moving northward, but generally the numbers are  smaller--say 10 to 30 in a band. Some of the more notable autumnal  movements toward the north, as reported by Charles, were the following:  at Simons' Lake in 1936 and again in 1938, when herds of fat bucks were  streaming past for a month and a half; likewise at Josie's Bay in 1940;  and through the Windy Hills and across Windy River in 1943. Fred  Schweder, Jr., said that most of the animals, in returning northward at  this season, cross Windy River 4 miles above its mouth or Windy Bay 4  miles from its head; comparatively few pass the mouths of Windy and  Little rivers. He remarked further that it is mostly bucks, with few  does and fawns, that make the passage on Windy Bay.    More or less evidence of such a movement toward the north in 1947 has  been presented in preceding pages, in the notes for September 6, 7, 11,  14, 20, 24, and 28, October 1, and even October 23. The numbers observed  so involved on each of these days varied from a solitary buck or a doe  with a fawn to about 300 of the animals. On some of these days, however,  other Caribou were observed making their way toward the south. It is  thus obvious that there was no universal impulse among the Caribou of a  given area to move simultaneously in a certain direction.    The general weather conditions on the nine above-mentioned days may be  summarized as follows. Every day but one was largely or wholly cloudy;  snow falling on three days, but ground bare on other days; wind  predominantly from the north; extreme temperatures, 26° and 61°; mean  daily average, 37.5°. Whether or not there is significance in the  matter, it appears that on those days within the period extending from  September 6 to October 1, when the Caribou were not definitely observed  moving northward, the winds were less likely to be northerly.  Furthermore, within this period there was never enough snow to interfere  appreciably with the animals' feeding on the ground lichens of the  Barrens.        [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Chiefly does and fawns, with several bucks bringing up the      rear. August 26, 1947.]    By October 6 there were 6 inches of snow on the ground, and on the  following day 200 Caribou swimming southward across Windy Bay may have  marked the beginning of the final movement into the timbered country. It  appears possible that a considerable fall of snow may have a definite  influence in inducing the Caribou to retreat from the Barrens.    On a trip from Windy River north to the Kazan River region in September,  1946, Charles Schweder found, during the first 45 miles, that the  Caribou were moving north; at the Kazan they were moving south, although  some were merely loitering. Northwest of the Kazan, the animals were  taking a westward course. During the latter part of his return trip to  Windy River, 11 or 12 days later, they had reversed the previous  direction and were traveling south.    For such a distinct and regular feature in the life cycle of the species  as the retrograde autumnal movement there must be some biological  explanation. Several possible factors appear reasonably clear. Perhaps  we may consider the Barren Grounds the true and preferred home of  _Rangifer arcticus_, from which a proportion of the population is driven  during part of the year under stress of insect attacks or shortage of  food. When the animals begin to enter the woods in August, there is no  shortage of food; thus an insect-induced frenzy may possibly be regarded  as a potent force driving them southward. In September a state of  comparative peace descends upon the caribou world: the current crop of  adult insects has subsided; the larvae of warble and nostril flies have  not attained the formidable size of the following spring and perhaps are  not yet causing any severe discomfort; little or no snow covers up the  food supply; the lakes and rivers, still unfrozen, offer a ready way of  escape from pursuing Wolves; moderate or even balmy weather gives nature  a pleasant mood. In short, both man and beast may well look upon early  autumn as the very finest time of year both on the Barrens and in the  adjacent wooded country.    Under these circumstances a definite retrograde movement out of the  wooded country in September on the part of many Caribou must indicate  their preference for the Barrens at this season. In any event, the  movement begins just after the insect menace has subsided to a  negligible stage. Possibly another inducement for retreating from the  wooded country in the early fall is the dearth of open areas in which  the animals may spend their resting periods, in comparative safety from  Wolves. It is only after the freeze-up that the surfaces of the lakes  and rivers supply this desideratum. This condition lasts from November  to June--precisely that part of the year in which the Caribou are  present in the wooded country in the greatest numbers.    But by November what are the conditions on the Barrens? The weather has  become severe; snow has covered up a large part of the ground lichens;  tree lichens are not to be had. And so at this season, with the coming  of the first heavy snows, there is a final movement out of the Barrens  into the shelter of the woods, leaving only a minority of the animals to  face a bleak and bitter winter in the open country. The biggest herds of  the year may then be seen passing southward. A few bucks are said to  remain during most winters in the Windy River area.    Far to the westward, toward Great Slave and Great Bear lakes, the  retrograde movements are somewhat different and more complicated  (Clarke, 1940: 96).    \"Mr. Carl Buchholz, of Churchill, describes the caribou migration at the  60th parallel, north of Churchill, as a southward migration in August,  northward in September, and then south in the autumn\" (Clarke, 1940:  97). (See also the next paragraph.)      _Fall migration in the Churchill region_    The following notes for 1947 were kindly furnished me by Angus MacIver.  He reported large numbers of Caribou moving southward across Caribou  Creek (25 miles south of Churchill) about November 10, a day after the  local freeze-up. He would then see thousands in a day. Prior to that  time (perhaps in September?) there had been two \"runs\" to the northward  and northwestward; these presumably represented the normal retrograde  migration in the fall. The herds engaged in these two northerly  movements must have previously passed southward farther inland. He  reported also that the rutting season this year had commenced a little  later than the usual October 15.      _References on migration._--Dobbs, 1774: 20, 22; Hearne, 1795:    39, 40, 56, 66, 74, 85-87, 286, 299; Franklin, 1823: 241-242;    Sabine, in Franklin, 1823: 667; Richardson, \"1825\": 328-329, and    1829: 242-243; Godman, 1831, +2+: 283-284; John Ross, 1835a:    328, 330, 337, 376, 390, 529-530, 628; J. C.
