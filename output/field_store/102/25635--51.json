Islamic republic - a particular form of government adopted by some  Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it  remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with  the laws of Islam.  Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in  China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous  revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to  keep in touch with the people.  Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers  as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a  class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists  (business owners), to a socialist \"dictatorship of the proletariat,\"  to, finally, a classless society - Communism.  Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final  stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from  developed to underdeveloped countries.  Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole  absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince -  with constitutionally limited authority.  Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small  group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or  power.  Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the  legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister,  premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according  to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the  government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as  to the parliament.  Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and  its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated  to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will  by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or  the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no  longer function.  Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its  head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from  a legislature (parliament).  Presidential - a system of government where the executive branch  exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not  accountable).  Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on  legislation.  Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing,  and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of  property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have  ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling  elite.  Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim  state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with  constitutionally limited authority.  Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as  the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government  subject to religious authority.  Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual  to the state by controlling not only all political and economic  matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its  population.

It includes former airports used  exclusively for helicopter operations but excludes heliports limited  to day operations and natural clearings that could support  helicopter landings and takeoffs.        HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate      This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged  15-49) living with HIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence rate is calculated  by dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at  yearend by the total adult population at yearend.        HIV/AIDS - deaths      This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children  who died of AIDS during a given calendar year.        HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS      This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children)  alive at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have  developed symptoms of AIDS.        Household income or consumption by percentage share      Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data.  Surveys based on income will normally show a more unequal  distribution than surveys based on consumption. The quality of  surveys is improving with time, yet caution is still necessary in  making inter-country comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes      See Data codes        I          Illicit drugs      This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs  - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside of medical channels.  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).  Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain  the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with  cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate,  cocoa, and cocoa butter.  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety  and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal,  Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium),  methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others  (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance  that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral  impairment in an individual.  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,  microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine  variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),  phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,  psilocyn).  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.  Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical  depressant.  Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis  sativa).  Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax  in Southwest Asia and Africa.  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer  to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural  narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine  (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with  codeine, Robitussin AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics  include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).  Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol,  Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon,  Lomotil).  Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of  the opium poppy.  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.  Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in  commercial operations that produce the drug for medical use.  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha  edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.  Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.  Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy  and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35842"],[0,"Microscopes and Accessory Apparatus: Catalogue No. 40 (#9)"],[1,"            =16.--=    [Illustration: Thoma's Haemacytometer.]      77. =Thoma's Haemacytometer= consists of an object glass        with carefully constructed cell, a ground absolutely        plane coverglass and two pipettes for mixing the blood        and saline solution used in the examinations. One of        these pipettes, for estimating the number of red        corpuscles is so graduated as to permit dilution of the        blood 100 or 200 times as required; the other, for        counting the white corpuscles (leucocytes), is graduated        for dilution of the blood 10 or 20 times.          The volume contents of the pipettes are most carefully        determined and the depth of the cell is established by        accurate micrometric measurement, thus permitting very        exact observations by means of this instrument.

Between the eye lens and        the collecting lens of a Huyghenian ocular there is a        millimeter scale etched on glass, above which is a        moveable indicator whose position is controlled by a        micrometer screw to which a graduated drum is attached.        The value of each graduation on the drum (about 1/20 of        the micrometer value of the objective) must be        determined for each combination of ocular and objective        by means of the stage micrometer. The eye lens of the        ocular is moveable to permit accurate focus upon the        scale. The apparatus slips into the tube of the        microscope like any ordinary eye-piece and is fixed in        position by a thumb-screw at the side                     =20.--=      84. =Micrometer eye-piece.= The mount unscrews in the        centre to permit the introduction of the micrometer        scale.

In        both eye-pieces the prism is so adjusted as to        accomplish total reflection of the image, thus doing        away with loss of light and with secondary reflections,        such disturbing features of those forms of drawing        apparatus of which a mirror forms an essential part.    [Illustration]      92. This =drawing eye-piece= is employed with the stand        in the vertical position. The reflected image lies at        the side of the microscope, the rays passing off at an        acute angle from the reflecting prism near the top of        the eye-piece. The eye-piece slips into the tube of the        microscope like any ordinary eye-piece and is held in        position by a thumb-screw. The drawing field is at once        visible without further adjustment, and the picture is        clear and sharp. The brightness of the drawing field may        be regulated by smoked glass plates mounted in two        moveable metal arms                                        =8.--=    [Illustration: Drawing eye-piece for drawing with inclined stand.]      93. This =drawing eye-piece= is similar in construction        to that just described, but is so arranged as to throw        the image vertically downwards behind the microscope        when the latter is inclined at an angle of 45 degrees.        In this case also the picture reflected is clear and        sharp, devoid of all disturbing secondary images. As the        image is reflected vertically downwards upon the table,        no special drawing stand is necessary as there is no        distortion of the picture. The intensity of the light        may be modified by smoked glass plates mounted in two        moveable metal arms                                       =10.--=          For a description of these drawing eye-pieces and of the        principles involved in their construction reference may        be had to the Zeitschrift fuer wissenschaftliche        Mikroskopie, XII, 1895.    [Illustration: Abbe's Drawing Apparatus.]      94. In =Abbe's Drawing Apparatus= the drawing field is        reflected by a mirror at the side of the instrument and        by a prism which fits over the eye-piece of the        microscope. The prism is supported on a vertical hinge        so that it may be readily turned out of the axis of the        microscope without disconnecting the whole apparatus        from the stand. It is shown turned to the side in the        figure. A cylindrical cap accompanies the apparatus        which fits over the prism holder and has six lateral        windows in which are smoked glasses of various        intensity, serving to regulate the lightness of the        reflected drawing field                                   =12.--=    [Illustration: Drawing Board No. 95. Drawing Board after Giesenhagen.]          The =Drawing boards= serve two purposes. They afford a        smooth plane surface for the drawing paper and they are        so arranged that they may be inclined at such an angle        as to receive the rays of the reflected image at right        angle to their surface, thus doing away with any        distortion of the image on the paper.      95. This =drawing board= is especially adapted for use        with drawing eye-piece No. 92. When in the position        indicated in the figure its drawing surface forms an        angle of 12 deg. to the horizontal                             =2.--=      96. In =Giesenhagen's drawing board= the drawing surface        may be adjusted at various angles and may be raised and        lowered                                                    =4.--=          For drawing eye-piece No. 93 and the Abbe drawing        apparatus the surface of the drawing board should be        horizontal.    [Illustration: Drawing apparatus after v. Tubeuf.]      97. The =drawing apparatus= after v. Tubeuf serves for        drawing objects from nature. By means of a prism mounted        in a metal box, the object is reflected into the eye in        such a manner that its image appears erected on the        drawing surface. This is quite an advantage when drawing        from nature but is unimportant when using a drawing        apparatus on the microscope. Two smoked glasses mounted        in moveable metal arms serve to moderate the intensity        of the light. On the side of the prism nearest the eye        is a small wheel diaphragm attached to regulate the size        of the opening. The apparatus is mounted on a heavy        nickel-plated stand with vertical and lateral        adjustments controlled by thumb-screws                    =12.--=            =Mechanical Stages.=    [Illustration: Mechanical stage No. 98.]      98. =Mechanical stage= adapted to Stands I, Ia and Ib.        The stage is readily attached to the microscope by means        of a small screw, _C_, which screws into a thread in the        microscope just behind its stage, and binds the        mechanical stage firmly in position and always in the        same position. It may be again removed by simply        unscrewing this set screw.
