The  solution will foam as if it were boiling, but it is entirely painless  and does not hurt the bird in the least. Repeat the swabbing, putting on  plenty of the solution, until it ceases to foam. It does not matter if a  little of the solution goes down the throat of the bird, as it is  perfectly harmless when swallowed by man, beast or bird, and it is the  best germicide known, being non-poisonous and odorless.    Some good authorities recommend painting the cankers with lemon juice  and putting a piece of alum in the drinking water, but we prefer the  peroxide of hydrogen treatment. Do not return a bird to the loft until  it is entirely well, and always disinfect the loft when a case of canker  is found in it. Directions for disinfecting are given further on in this  chapter.    If the disease does not respond quickly to treatment, it is sometimes  best to turn the affected birds out of the fly and let them shift for  themselves without restraint. The open air and scanty supply of food  together with whatever they are able to find of nature's remedies will  effect a cure in nearly every case. Sometimes a bird will leave and  never return but just as well this loss as to kill the bird, or have  others in the fly affected. By this method I have often cured young  birds just beginning to shift for themselves and older breeders in the  last stages of Canker and when the bird is entirely recovered from the  disease it may easily be caught and returned to the loft without  endangering the rest.      ROUP    Roup sometimes appears in a loft, especially during damp weather or when  the birds have not had proper housing. It is shown by the discharge from  the nostrils, which has a very offensive odor. It is highly contagious  in its later stages, and if not cured before it takes on the contagious  form is incurable. When a bird has reached the last stages it should be  killed and burned or buried far from the loft.    If a bird is noticed to have a discharge from the nostrils it should be  attended to at once as the disease is very easy to cure at that time.  Put some coal oil in a sewing machine can and squirt some of the oil up  each nostril and in the slit in the top of the mouth. This usually  effects a cure, but if it is not better in a few hours use camphorated  oil in the same way. Any druggist will supply the camphorated oil.      CHOLERA    Cholera is a dreadful disease to contend with, but no pigeon-breeder who  keeps his birds properly need fear it, as it is caused by cold, dampness  and filth in nine cases out of ten. It is very contagious and it is very  hard to cure. Happily, the disease does not worry the careful breeder,  but once it gets started in a loft it may kill off every bird in it  unless vigorous measures are taken to stop its progress.    When a bird is attacked with cholera it presents a very miserable  appearance. Its plumage is ruffled up, its crop fills with water which  has a very offensive odor, and diarrhoea appears. The disease runs its  course rapidly and soon the victim is dead.    To stop the progress of cholera in a loft, put ten drops of carbolic  acid in a gallon of drinking water for two days. Feed only the very best  feed. Follow the carbolic acid by putting a tablespoonful of tincture of  gentian in each gallon of drinking water for ten days. Disinfect the  house thoroughly twice a week until the disease disappears.      VERTIGO    Vertigo is a brain affection which is incurable, although it does not  usually kill quickly. It is characterized by turning the head over the  shoulder and convulsions. These convulsions often occur when anyone  enters the loft, while at other times the bird is quiet. There is no  cure and it is best to kill the bird to put it out of its misery, as it  will never again be of any use as a breeder.      EGG-BOUND    Young hens are often affected by becoming egg-bound; that is; they are  unable to force the passage of the egg from the ovary to the nest.    When a hen shows signs of distress, catch her and carefully feel of her  abdomen. If she is egg-bound, the egg can be felt. Anoint the passage  with vaseline and introduce the finger as far as possible, being careful  not to break the egg. Then hold the hen over steam as hot as can be  borne without scalding, until the parts are thoroughly steamed and  relaxed. After this, carefully put the hen on the nest and usually she  will be able to pass the egg.      PIGEON POX    Sometimes a disease similar to small pox in human beings and chicken-pox  in poultry appears in a loft. This is known by small sores which appear  about the head and face.    When this disease appears, wash the sores with a solution of copper  sulphate or a solution of peroxide of hydrogen and water, equal parts.  Either of these solutions will cure the disease in a short time.      SUDDEN COLDS    Sometimes a pigeon will sit out in a cold rain or sleep in a stray draft  and catch cold. This makes it sick and stupid, and it should be cared  for at once.    To cure a cold of this kind, give five-drops of castor oil and the next  day a one grain capsule of quinine. Follow this with ten drop doses of  cod liver oil for a few days and the bird will soon be as lively as  ever.      LEG WEAKNESS    Leg weakness is usually caused by inbreeding or an accidental weakness.  There is no certain cure for it, because we never know just what has  caused the trouble. If a bird seems weak in the legs rub some  camphorated oil on the hock joint and repeat the operation as long as  necessary. The short-legged varieties like the Homer very seldom have  any trouble with their legs.      WING DISEASE    Wing disease is a trouble of the \"elbow.\" It is caused by a hurt, and  the injured bird becomes lame in the wing. Presently a lump forms on the  elbow and this increases in size, filling with a yellowish cheesy  matter, causing the bird to drag the wing.    The only thing to do is to run camphorated oil on the injured spot, and  when the swelling has reached full size cut it open. Usually the bird is  not injured as a breeder, but it must make its nest on the floor, as it  can not fly. If the disease is noticed at the very start, it sometimes  may be cured; but if the trouble is neglected, a crippled bird is the  result. For the sake of the appearance of the flock such birds should  not be allowed to remain in the loft. If your windows or openings from  the loft to the fly are good size there is little danger of this trouble  for it is usually caused by the bird striking the wing in its rush to  get outside. Birds that are wild or too often disturbed are more liable  to this trouble.      WORMS    Worms sometimes bother pigeons. If a bird has a varying appetite and  seems to be running down, watch its droppings and it is likely that  worms may be found in them. If the worms are not found, it is not  conclusive evidence that they are not sapping the vitality of the bird  and it should be treated.    A bit of garlic every morning will usually cure the disease. The piece  of garlic should be about the size of a pea. A pill of powdered areca  nut mixed with butter is also an effective remedy, or a pill as large as  a small pea of gum aloes will kill the worms. Give any one of these  remedies and expect a cure. Give the remedy before the bird has eaten in  the morning.      LICE    Lice are not a disease, but they can do more damage than any disease. If  they once get a start in the pigeon loft, it requires heroic treatment  to get them subdued. If attention is paid to cleanliness, old nests  taken out and burned as soon as they are empty, insect powder sprinkled  in the nest boxes and tobacco stems are used for nesting material, lice  will never get a foothold in the loft. If it should happen that lice get  a start, take the birds out of the loft and clean it thoroughly. Then  paint the walls and nest boxes with kerosene and afterward whitewash  every part of the inside with lime.      DISINFECTANTS    Any druggist will supply a good disinfectant and give direction how to  mix it for use. This should be sprinkled about the floor once in two or  three weeks, and always mixed with the whitewash which is used on the  loft. A mild disinfectant should be sprinkled on the floor at least once  a week, and twice a week is better. Go quietly into the loft and gently  sprinkle the solution on the floor, but not on the nests, as this  frightens the birds. Keep the air of the lofts always smelling sweet and  pure and there will be no trouble with disease.      DOUGLAS MIXTURE    Douglas Mixture is an old-time tonic, much esteemed by a good many  breeders of pigeons and poultry. It is made by dissolving eight ounces  of iron sulphate (copperas) in two gallons of water and then very slowly  adding one ounce of sulphuric acid. Put in jugs and it will keep  indefinitely. If a tablespoon of this is put in the drinking water  occasionally, it will act as a tonic and make the blood richer. It is  especially recommended for use during the molting season.      GENTIAN AS A TONIC    Compound tincture of gentian is highly recommended as a tonic for  pigeons. If the birds seem out of condition, a tea-spoonful of this in  the drinking water will tone them up and give them good appetites again.  When the birds are molting during the months of September, October and  November, a tablespoonful of compound extract of gentian in the drinking  water every Sunday morning will keep the birds in condition, but this  should not be used if the Douglas Mixture is used as a tonic.      SWEET FERN TEA    For looseness of the bowels, sweet fern tea has been found a very good  remedy. Looseness of the bowels occurs from feeding too much wheat that  has not been well dried. It also comes from impure water or unsound feed  of any kind. To cure it a good handful of the leaves is put into three  gallons of water and boiled down to one-half.

REMINISCENCES OF THE LATE MR. COOPER.--HIS LAST DAYS.    A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL.    BY JOHN W. FRANCIS, M. D., LL. D.                                    NEW-YORK, _October 1st, 1851_.    MY DEAR SIR,--I readily comply with your wish that I should furnish you  with such reminiscences of the late Mr. Cooper as occur to me, although the  pressure of professional engagements absolutely forbids such details as I  would gladly record. For nearly thirty years I have been the occasional  medical adviser, and always the ardent personal friend of the illustrious  deceased; but our intercourse has been so fragmentary, owing to the  distance we have lived apart, and the busy lives we have both led, that the  impressions which now throng upon and impress me are desultory and varied,  though endearing. I first knew Mr. Cooper in 1823. He at that time was  recognized as the author of \"Precaution,\" of \"the Spy,\" and of \"the  Pioneers.\" The two last-named works had attracted especial notice by their  widely extended circulation, and the novelty of their character in American  literature. He was often to be seen at that period in conversation at the  City Hotel in Broadway, near Old Trinity, where many of our most renowned  naval and military men convened. He was the original projector of a  literary and social association called the \"Bread and Cheese Club,\" whose  place of rendezvous was at Washington Hall. They met weekly, in the  evening, and furnished the occasion of much intellectual gratification and  genial pleasure. That most adhesive friend, the poet Halleck, Chancellor  Kent, G. C. Verplanck, Wiley, the publisher of Mr. Cooper's works, Dekay,  the naturalist, C. A. Davis (Jack Downing), Charles King, now President of  Columbia College, J. Depeyster Ogden, J. W. Jarvis, the painter, John and  William Duer, and many others, were of the confederacy. Washington Irving,  at the period of the formation of this circle of friends, was in England,  occupied with his inimitable \"Sketch Book.\" I had the honor of an early  admittance to the Club. In balloting for membership the bread declared an  affirmative; and two ballots of cheese against an individual proclaimed  non-admittance.    From the meetings of this society Mr. Cooper was rarely absent. When  presiding officer of the evening, he attracted especial consideration from  the richness of his anecdotes, his wide American knowledge, and his  courteous behavior. These meetings were often signally characterized by the  number of invited guests of high reputation who gathered thither for  recreative purposes, both of mind and body; jurists of acknowledged  eminence, governors of different States, senators, members of the House of  Representatives, literary men of foreign distinction, and authors of repute  in our own land. It was gratifying to observe the dexterity with which Mr.  Cooper would cope with some eastern friend who contributed to our delight  with a \"Boston notion,\" or with Trelawny, the associate of Byron,  descanting on Greece and the \"Younger Son,\" or with any guests of the Club,  however dissimilar their habits or character; accommodating his  conversation and manners with the most marvellous facility. The New-York  attachments of Mr. Cooper were ever dominant. I witnessed a demonstration  of the early enthusiasm and patriotic activity of our late friend in his  efforts, with many of our leading citizens, in getting up the Grand Castle  Garden Ball, given in honor of Lafayette. The arrival of the \"Nation's  Guest\" at New-York, in 1824, was the occasion of the most joyful  demonstrations, and the celebration was a splendid spectacle; it brought  together celebrities from many remote parts of the Union. Mr. Cooper must  have undergone extraordinary fatigue during the day and following night;  but nearly as he was exhausted, he exhibited, when the public festivals  were brought to a close, that astonishing readiness and skill in literary  execution for which he was always so remarkable. Adjourning near daybreak  to the office of his friend Mr. Charles King, he wrote out more quickly  than any other hand could copy, the very long and masterly report which  next day appeared in Mr. King's paper--a report which conveyed to tens of  thousands who had not been present, no inconsiderable portion of the  enjoyment they had felt who were the immediate participants in this famous  festival. The manly bearing, keen intelligence, and thoroughly honorable  instincts of Mr. Cooper, united as they were with this gift of  writing--soon most effectively exhibited in his literary labors, now  constantly increasing--excited my highest expectations of his career as an  author, and my sincere esteem for the man. There was a fresh promise, a  vigorous impulse, and especially an American enthusiasm about him, that  seemed to indicate not only individual fame, but national honor. Since that  period I have followed his brilliant course with no less admiration than  delight.    It was to me a cause of deep regret that soon after his return from Europe,  crowned with a distinct and noble reputation, he became involved in a  series of law-suits, growing out of libels, and originating partly in his  own imprudence, and partly in the reckless severity of the press. But these  are but temporary considerations in the retrospect of his achievements; and  if I mistake not, in these difficulties he in every instance succeeded in  gaining the verdict of the jury. It was a task insurmountable to overcome a  _fact_ as stated by Mr. Cooper. Associated as he was in my own mind with  the earliest triumphs of American letters, I think of him as the creator of  the genuine nautical and forest romances of \"Long Tom Coffin\" and  \"Leatherstocking;\" as the illustrator of our country's scenes and  characters to the Europeans; and not as the critic of our republican  inconsistencies, or as a litigant with caustic editors.    It is well known that for a long period Mr. Cooper, at occasional times  only, visited New-York city. His residence for many years was an elegant  and quiet mansion on the southern borders of Otsego Lake. Here--in his  beautiful retreat, embellished by the substantial fruits of his labors, and  displaying everywhere his exquisite taste, his mind, ever intent on  congenial tasks, which, alas! are left unfinished, surrounded by a devoted  and highly cultivated family, and maintaining the same clearness of  perception, serene firmness, and integrity of tone, which distinguished him  in the meridian of his life--were his mental employments prosecuted. He  lived chiefly in rural seclusion, and with habits of methodical industry.  When visiting the city he mingled cordially with his old friends; and it  was on the last occasion of this kind, at the beginning of April, that he  consulted me with some earnestness in regard to his health. He complained  of the impaired tone of the digestive organs, great torpor of the liver,  weakness of muscular activity, and feebleness in walking. Such suggestions  were offered for his relief as the indications of disease warranted. He  left the city for his country residence, and I was gratified shortly after  to learn from him of his better condition.    During July and August I maintained a correspondence with him on the  subject of his increasing physical infirmities, and frankly expressed to  him the necessity of such remedial measures as seemed clearly necessary.  Though occasionally relieved of my anxieties by the kind communications of  his excellent friend and attending physician, Dr. Johnson, I was not  without solicitude, both from his own statements as well as those of Dr.  Johnson himself, that his disorder was on the increase; certain symptoms  were indeed mitigated, but the radical features of his illness had not been  removed. A letter which I soon received induced me forthwith to repair to  Cooperstown, and on the 27th of August I saw Mr. Cooper at his own  dwelling. My reception was cordial. With his family about him he related  with great clearness the particulars of his sufferings, and the means of  relief to which he was subjected. Dr. Johnson was in consultation. I at  once was struck with the heroic firmness of the sufferer, under an  accumulation of depressing symptoms. His physical aspect was much altered  from that noble freshness he was wont to bear; his complexion was pallid;  his interior extremities greatly enlarged by serous effusion; his debility  so extreme as to require an assistant for change of position in bed; his  pulse sixty-four. There could be no doubt that the long continued hepatic  obstruction had led to confirmed dropsy, which, indeed, betrayed itself in  several other parts of the body. Yet was he patient and collected. That  powerful intellect still held empire with commanding force, clearness, and  vigor. I explained to him the nature of his malady; its natural termination  when uncontrolled; dwelt upon the favorable condition and yet regular  action of the heart, and other vital functions, and the urgent necessity of  endeavoring still more to fulfil certain indications, in order to overcome  the force of particular tendencies in the disorder. I frankly assured him  that within the limits of a week a change in the complaint was  indispensable to lessen our forebodings of its ungovernable nature.    He listened with fixed attention; and now and then threw out suggestions of  cure such as are not unfrequent with cultivated minds.    The great characteristics of his intellect were now even more conspicuous  than before. Not a murmur escaped his lips; conviction of his extreme  illness wrought no alteration of features; he gave no expression of  despondency; his tone and his manner were equally dignified, cordial, and  natural. It was his happiness to be blessed with a family around him whose  greatest gratification was to supply his every want, and a"]]]
