For  God's sake cut my feet off!\"    And Philip, hearing these cries from afar, was glad, though smiled  he never a smile.    Queen Marie's dames of honour all left her, wishing to be present at  the burning, and the last of all to desert her was the said Duchess  of Alba, who, hearing the cries of the sculptor, could not forbear  to witness the spectacle.    So, in the presence of King Philip and of his lords, princes, counts,  equerries, and ladies, the sculptor was bound to the stake by a  long chain. And all round the stake was a circle of flaming bundles  of straw and fiery torches, the idea being that if he wished, the  sculptor could be roasted very gently by keeping close to the stake  in the centre of the circle, thus avoiding the full rigour of the fire.    And right curiously did they watch him, naked or almost naked as he  was, and trying to stiffen his resolution against the heat of the fire.    Meanwhile Queen Marie was stricken with a great thirst, lying there  alone on her bed of childbirth. And seeing the half of a melon on  a plate, she dragged herself out of bed, and took hold of the melon  and ate it all. But thereafter the cold substance of the melon made  her to sweat and to shiver, and she lay upon the floor unable to move.    \"Alas!\" she cried, \"would that there were some one to carry me back  into bed that I might get warm again!\"    Then it was that she heard the cry of the poor sculptor:    \"Cut off my feet! Cut off my feet!\"    \"Ah!\" said the Queen, \"is that some dog or other baying at my death?\"    It was at this very moment that the sculptor, seeing around him none  but the faces of Spaniards, his enemies, bethought him of Flanders,  the land of valorous men, and he crossed his arms on his breast,  and dragging the long chain behind him, walked straight towards  the outer circle of the straw and the flaming torches. And standing  upright there, still with his arms crossed:    \"This,\" cried he, \"this is how the men of Flanders can die in the  face of the tyrants of Spain. Cut off their feet--not mine--that  they may be able no more to run into the way of crime. Flanders for  ever! Flanders for ever!\"    And the ladies clapped their hands, crying him mercy for the sake of  his proud look.    And he died.    And Queen Marie shook all over her body, and she cried out, her teeth  chattering together with the chill of approaching death. And her arms  and legs grew stiff, and she said:    \"Put me back into my bed that I may be warmed.\"    So she died.    And thus it was, according to the prophecy of Katheline the good  sorceress, that Philip the King sowed everywhere he went the seeds  of death, and blood, and tears.              XXII      But Ulenspiegel and Nele loved each other, and their love was true.    It was now the end of April. All the trees were in bloom, and every  plant was swollen with sap, for May was near, the month of the peacock,  flowered like a bouquet, the month that sends the nightingales singing  aloud in the trees of all the earth.    Oftentimes would Nele and Ulenspiegel wander together along the  roads. Nele would lean on the arm of Ulenspiegel, and hang round him  with her two hands. Ulenspiegel loved this little game, and often  did he pass his arm about Nele's waist, to hold her the better,  as he said. And she was happy, but spake not a word.    Softly along the roads blew the wind, wafting the scent from the  fields; the sea boomed in the distance, rocking lazily in the sun;  Ulenspiegel seemed like some youthful devil, all pride; and Nele like  a little saint from Paradise, half shy of her happiness.    She leant her head against Ulenspiegel's shoulder, and her hand was in  his, and as they passed along he kissed her forehead, and her cheek,  and her sweet lips. But still she spake no word.    After some hours they grew hot and thirsty, and they drank milk at  the house of a peasant; and yet they were not refreshed. Then they  sat them down on the grass by the side of the ditch, and Nele seemed  pale and pensive, and Ulenspiegel looked at her, afraid that something  was amiss.    \"You are unhappy?\" said she.    \"Yes,\" he admitted.    \"But why?\" she asked him.    \"I know not,\" said he. \"But these apple-trees and cherry-trees  all in flower, this air so warm that one would say it was charged  with lightning, these daisies that open their blushing petals to  the fields, and oh, the hawthorn, there, close by us in the hedge,  all white.... Will no one tell me why it is that I feel troubled,  and always ready to die or to go to sleep? And my heart beats so  strangely when I hear the birds awaken in the trees, and when I see  the swallows coming home! Then I am fain to go away beyond the sun and  beyond the moon. And sometimes I am cold, and then again I am hot. Ah,  Nele! would that I were no longer a creature of this low world! Verily  I would give my life a thousand times to her that would love me!\"    Yet Nele spake not at all, but smiling at her ease sat looking at  Ulenspiegel.              XXIII      One Day of All Souls, Ulenspiegel went forth from Notre Dame with  certain other vagabonds of his own age. Among them was Lamme Goedzak,  who seemed strayed among them like a lamb in the midst of a herd of  wolves. Lamme treated them with drinks all round, for his mother, as  her custom was on Sundays and feast days, had given him three patards.    So he went with his companions to the tavern In dem Rooden Schildt--at  the sign of the Red Shield. Jan van Liebeke kept the house, and he  served them with dobbel knollaert from Courtrai.    They began to be warmed with the drink, and the talk turned on the  subject of prayer, and Ulenspiegel declared quite openly that, for  his part, he thought that Masses for the dead did nobody any good,  except the priests who said them.    Now in that company there was a Judas, who went and denounced  Ulenspiegel for a heretic. And in spite of the tears of Soetkin, and  the entreaties of Claes, Ulenspiegel was seized and taken prisoner. He  remained shut up in a cellar for the space of a month and three days  without seeing a soul. The jailor himself consumed three-quarters of  the ration that was given him for food.    During all this time the authorities were informing themselves as  to Ulenspiegel's reputation--whether it was good or whether it was  bad. They found that there was not much to be said against him except  that he was a lively sort of customer, always railing against his  neighbours. But they could not find that he had ever spoken evil of  Our Lord God, or of Madame the Virgin, nor yet of the Saints. On this  account the sentence passed on him was a light one, for he might easily  have been condemned to have his face branded with a hot iron and to  be flogged till the blood flowed. But in consideration of his youth,  the judges merely sentenced him to walk in his shirt behind the priests  barefoot and hatless, and holding a candle in his hand. And this he  was to do on the Feast of the Ascension, in the first procession that  left the church.    So it was done, and when the procession was on the point of turning  back, Ulenspiegel was made to stop beneath the porch of Notre Dame,  and there cry out aloud:    \"Thanks be to our Lord Jesus! Thanks be to the reverend priests! Sweet  are their prayers unto the souls in purgatory; nay, they are filled  with every virtue of refreshment! For each Ave is even as a bucket  of water poured upon the backs of those who are being punished,  and every Pater is a tubful!\"    And the people heard him with great devotion, and not without a smile.    On Whit-Sunday the same proceeding had to be gone through, and  Ulenspiegel followed again in the procession with nothing on but his  shirt, and with his head bare, and no shoes on his feet, and holding  a candle in his hand. On returning to the church he stood up in the  porch, holding the candle most reverently in his hand, and then in  a high, clear voice (yet not without sundry waggish grimaces) spake  as follows:    \"If the prayers of all good Christians are very comforting to the souls  in purgatory, how much more so must be those of the Dean of Notre Dame,  a holy man and perfect in the performance of every virtue. Verily,  his prayers assuage the flames of fire in such wise that they are  transformed all of a sudden into ice. But yet be sure that not an  atom of it goes to refresh the devils that are in hell.\"    And again the people hearkened to what he said with great  devotion. But some of them smiled, and the Dean smiled too, in his  grim ecclesiastical way.    After that, Ulenspiegel was condemned to banishment from the land of  Flanders for the space of three years, on condition that he went to  Rome on pilgrimage and brought back with him the papal absolution. For  this sentence Claes had to pay three florins: but he gave an extra  florin to his son, and bought him a pilgrim's habit.    Ulenspiegel was heart-broken when he came to say good-bye to Claes  and Soetkin on the day of his departure. He embraced them both, and  his mother was all in tears; but she accompanied him far on his way,  and Claes went too, and many of the townsmen and townswomen.    When they were home again Claes said to his wife:    \"Good wife, it is very hard that such a boy should be condemned to  this cruel punishment and all for a few silly words.\"    \"Why, you are crying, my man!\" said Soetkin. \"Truly, you love him more  than you like to show. Yes, you are sobbing now with a man's sobs,  sobs that are like unto the tears of a lion.\"    But he answered her not.    As for Nele, she had gone to hide herself in the barn, so that none  might see that she also wept for Ulenspiegel. But she followed afar  after Soetkin and Claes and the other townsfolk: and when she saw  her lover disappearing in the distance, she ran after him and threw  herself on his neck.    \"In Italy you will meet many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#9)"],[1,"into the Court Circular, that \"his majesty has been slightly  indisposed within the last few days;\" but then it was soon followed by  a very positive assurance, that his majesty's favourite and long-matured  resolution to give a state banquet to the knights of the four orders,  was immediately to be carried into effect. Lady St Julians had the first  information of this important circumstance; it confirmed her original  conviction: she determined to go on with her quadrille. Egremont,  with something interesting at stake himself, was staggered by this  announcement, and by Lady St Julians' unshaken faith. He consulted his  mother: Lady Marney shook her head. \"Poor woman!\" said Lady Marney, \"she  is always wrong. I know,\" continued her ladyship, placing her finger  to her lip, \"that Prince Esterhazy has been pressing his long-postponed  investiture as a Grand Cross, in order that he may dine at this very  banquet; and it has been announced to him that it is impossible,  the king's health will not admit of it. When a simple investiture is  impossible, a state banquet to the four orders is very probable. No,\"  said Lady Marney with a sigh; \"it is a great blow for all of us, but it  is no use shutting our eyes to the fact. The poor dear king will never  show again.\"    And about a week after this there appeared the first bulletin. From that  instant, though the gullish multitude studied the daily reports with  grave interest; their hopes and speculations and arrangements changing  with each phrase; for the initiated there was no suspense. All knew that  it was over; and Lady St Julians, giving up her quadrille, began to look  about for seats in parliament for her sons.    \"What a happiness it is to have a clever mother,\" exclaimed Egremont,  as he pondered over the returns of his election agent. Lady Marney, duly  warned of the impending catastrophe, was experiencing all the advantages  of prior information. It delighted her to meet Lady St Julians driving  distractedly about town, calling at clubs, closeted with red tapers,  making ingenious combinations that would not work, by means of which  some one of her sons was to stand in coalition with some rich parvenu;  to pay none of the expenses and yet to come in first. And all this time,  Lady Marney, serene and smiling, had the daily pleasure of assuring Lady  St Julians what a relief it was to her that Charles had fixed on his  place. It had been arranged indeed these weeks past; \"but then,  you know,\" concluded Lady Marney in the sweetest voice and with a  blandishing glance, \"I never did believe in that hay fever.\"    In the meantime the impending event changed the whole aspect of the  political world. The king dying before the new registration was the  greatest blow to pseudo-toryism since his majesty, calling for a hackney  coach, went down and dissolved parliament in 1831. It was calculated  by the Tadpoles and Tapers that a dissolution by Sir Robert, after the  registration of 1837, would give him a clear majority, not too great a  one, but large enough: a manageable majority; some five-and-twenty or  thirty men, who with a probable peerage or two dangling in the distance,  half-a-dozen positive baronetcies, the Customs for their constituents,  and Court balls for their wives, might be induced to save the state.  0! England, glorious and ancient realm, the fortunes of thy polity are  indeed strange! The wisdom of the Saxons, Norman valour, the state-craft  of the Tudors, the national sympathies of the Stuarts, the spirit of the  latter Guelphs struggling against their enslaved sovereignty,--these are  the high qualities, that for a thousand years have secured thy national  developement. And now all thy memorial dynasties end in the huckstering  rule of some thirty unknown and anonymous jobbers! The Thirty at Athens  were at least tyrants. They were marked men. But the obscure majority,  who under our present constitution are destined to govern England, are  as secret as a Venetian conclave. Yet on their dark voices all depends.  Would you promote or prevent some great measure that may affect  the destinies of unborn millions, and the future character of the  people,--take, for example, a system of national education,--the  minister must apportion the plunder to the illiterate clan; the scum  that floats on the surface of a party; or hold out the prospect of  honours, which are only honourable when in their transmission they  impart and receive lustre; when they are the meed of public virtue  and public services, and the distinction of worth and of genius. It is  impossible that the system of the thirty can long endure in an age of  inquiry and agitated spirit like the present. Such a system may suit  the balanced interests and the periodical and alternate command of rival  oligarchical connections: but it can subsist only by the subordination  of the sovereign and the degradation of the multitude; and cannot accord  with an age, whose genius will soon confess that Power and the People  are both divine.    \"He can't last ten days,\" said a whig secretary of the treasury with a  triumphant glance at Mr Taper as they met in Pall Mall; \"You're out for  our lives.\"    \"Don't you make too sure for yourselves,\" rejoined in despair the  dismayed Taper. \"It does not follow that because we are out, that you  are in.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"There is such a person as Lord Durham in the world,\" said Mr Taper very  solemnly.    \"Pish,\" said the secretary.    \"You may pish,\" said Mr Taper, \"but if we have a radical government, as  I believe and hope, they will not be able to get up the steam as they  did in --31; and what with church and corn together, and the Queen  Dowager, we may go to the country with as good a cry as some other  persons.\"    \"I will back Melbourne against the field, now,\" said the secretary.    \"Lord Durham dined at Kensington on Thursday,\" said Taper, \"and not a  whig present.\"    \"Ay; Durham talks very fine at dinner,\" said the secretary, \"but he has  no real go in him. When there is a Prince of Wales, Lord Melbourne means  to make Durham governor to the heir apparent, and that will keep him  quiet.\"    \"What do you hear?\" said Mr Tadpole, joining them; \"I am told he has  quite rallied.\"    \"Don't you flatter yourself,\" said the secretary.    \"Well, we shall hear what they say on the hustings,\" said Tadpole  looking boldly.    \"Who's afraid!\" said the secretary. \"No, no, my dear fellow, you are  dead beat; the stake is worth playing for, and don't suppose we are  such flats as to lose the race for want of jockeying. Your humbugging  registration will never do against a new reign. Our great men mean  to shell out, I tell you; we have got Croucher; we will denounce the  Carlton and corruption all over the kingdom; and if that won't do, we  will swear till we are black in the face, that the King of Hanover  is engaged in a plot to dethrone our young Queen:\" and the triumphant  secretary wished the worthy pair good morning.    \"They certainly have a very good cry,\" said Taper mournfully.    \"After all, the registration might be better,\" said Tadpole, \"but still  it is a very good one.\"    The daily bulletins became more significant; the crisis was evidently  at hand. A dissolution of parliament at any time must occasion great  excitement; combined with a new reign, it inflames the passions of every  class of the community. Even the poor begin to hope; the old, wholesome  superstition still lingers, that the sovereign can exercise power; and  the suffering multitude are fain to believe that its remedial character  may be about to be revealed in their instance. As for the aristocracy  in a new reign, they are all in a flutter. A bewildering vision of  coronets, stars, and ribbons; smiles, and places at court; haunts their  noontide speculations and their midnight dreams. Then we must not forget  the numberless instances in which the coming event is deemed to supply  the long-sought opportunity of distinction, or the long-dreaded cause  of utter discomfiture; the hundreds, the thousands, who mean to get into  parliament, the units who dread getting out. What a crashing change from  lounging in St James's street to sauntering on Boulogne pier; or,  after dining at Brookes and supping at Crockford's, to be saved from  destruction by the friendly interposition that sends you in an official  capacity to the marsupial sympathies of Sydney or Swan River!    Now is the time for the men to come forward who have claims; claims for  spending their money, which nobody asked them to do, but which of course  they only did for the sake of the party. They never wrote for their  party, or spoke for their party, or gave their party any other vote than  their own; but they urge their claims,--to something; a commissionership  of anything, or a consulship anywhere; if no place to be had, they  are ready to take it out in dignities. They once looked to the privy  council, but would now be content with an hereditary honour; if they can  have neither, they will take a clerkship in the Treasury for a younger  son. Perhaps they may get that in time; at present they go away growling  with a gaugership; or, having with desperate dexterity at length  contrived to transform a tidewaiter into a landwaiter. But there is  nothing like asking--except refusing.    Hark! it tolls! All is over. The great bell of the metropolitan  cathedral announces the death of the last son of George the Third who  probably will ever reign in England. He was a good man: with feelings  and sympathies; deficient in culture rather than ability; with a sense  of duty; and with something of the conception of what should be the  character of an English monarch. Peace to his manes! We are summoned to  a different scene.    In a palace in a garden--not in a haughty keep, proud with the fame,  but dark with the violence of ages; not in a regal pile, bright with the  splendour, but soiled with the intrigues,"]]]
