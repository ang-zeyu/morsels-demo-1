In the living cell these disappear at  intervals and then appear again.    _Oral groove_, a funnel-shaped groove in one side of some one-celled  animals, conducting food to the mouth. In paramecium it often shows  as an oblique line when the animal rolls.    _Gullet_, the inner end of the oral groove.    _Cilia_, numerous minute, vibrating, protoplasmic hairs on the  surface of many cells.    _Respiration_, the passage of oxygen into the tissues of a living  organism and of carbon dioxide out of them. These gases can pass  through any thin, moist, organic membrane. When such a membrane  separates two fluids which differ in the amount of oxygen they  contain, oxygen passes to the fluid containing the smaller amount.[2]  The same is true of carbon dioxide. Respiration is believed to occur  in all living organisms.     [2] This passage of fluids through membranes is known as _osmosis_.    _Digestion_, the process of making food materials soluble, so that  they can pass through membranes and be used to build up protoplasm. A  few forms of cells are able to take in solid food and digest it in  their protoplasm, but most cells can admit only fluid food.    _Fission_, a method of reproduction used in all cells, by which a  cell divides itself into two, usually through the center. In some  one-celled animals this may be preceded by _conjugation_, when two  animals unite temporarily and exchange nuclear substance; or in some  forms two cells may fuse and the resulting cell may divide. _Budding_  is a form of fission in which a small projection is formed on the  parent cell and then cut off, making a new individual.    _Protozoa_ (first animals), animals of one cell, existing alone or in  loose colonies.          _Observations._    1. Examine a single cell, stained to show structure. Identify  the nucleus, cytoplasm, and, if present, the nucleolus or the  micronucleus, and the cell wall. Draw to show the form of the cell  and the details of its structure. Label all details.    2. Examine some stained paramecia. Select a typical one and identify  in it nucleus, micronucleus, cytoplasm, and cell wall or cell  membrane. You may also be able to see vacuoles, looking like holes in  the stained protoplasm. Give reasons for considering this animal to  be a single cell. Draw one, to show its cellular structure. Label all  details.    3. Clean a slide and cover glass, place a drop of water containing  living paramecia on the slide, cover it, and examine. What structures  do you see which you saw in the stained paramecia? What structures do  not show? Identify any new structures you may observe. Identify also  the leading end and the side containing the oral groove.    4. Describe the shape of the animal.      What is the actual length of the animal?    5. After watching the animal for some time, describe the path  followed by a given specimen as it crosses the field of the  microscope. What reason can you see, if any, why this paramecium is  moving? What external factors, if any, seem to determine the path it  follows?    6. How rapidly do paramecia really move? What structures do they use  in locomotion?      How do they manage to move in one direction, instead of    alternately backward and forward? How do they manage to move in a    straight line, though their bodies are not symmetrical?    7. What is the food of the paramecia? How do they find it? Find a  specimen at rest and watch the oral groove. Suggest a method by which  food may be collected into it. If possible, note the process of  swallowing, and the resulting food ball.      _Note._--If powdered carmine be placed in the water with some    paramecia, it can be seen in the food balls a half hour or so    later.    8. Where are the food balls located? Watch them in an individual  until you notice their motion. Where are the larger food balls? the  smaller ones? Assuming them to have been of approximately equal sizes  when they were taken in, how can you account for differences now?    9. Where are the contracting vacuoles? How many are there? How often  does one contract?      What is their function?    10. As you have been studying paramecia, to what external influences  (as contact, heat, light, etc.) have you seen them respond? How do  they show it when they do respond? Is such a response an advantage to  them or not? What would be the result if they were not able to detect  changes in their surroundings?    11. Where does respiration occur in paramecia? Where do they obtain  their supply of oxygen?    12. Among the paramecia you are studying you usually find at least  one in the process of fission. Watch it until the halves separate, if  you can. Compare the halves. Do they rank as parent and offspring? If  so, which is which? If not, which are they, parent or offspring?    13. If you happen to find a pair conjugating, notice the process, as  far as you can, in the living animals.          _Suggested drawings._    a. A drawing to show all the details seen in the living paramecium.    b. A diagram to show the path followed by a paramecium to get around  some obstacle.    c. Drawings to show that paramecia are constant in shape and yet  flexible.    d. A drawing to show at least one stage in fission. This may be from  a permanent preparation.    e. A drawing to show paramecia conjugating. This also may be from a  permanent preparation.    f. Instead of all these separate drawings they may be combined into  one. Represent the field of the microscope, and in it draw all  necessary figures, to show the facts called for in the first five  drawings and any other facts you have observed about living protozoa.  Make the whole drawing to scale.      Summary of Important Points in the Study of Paramecia      1. Look back over your study of paramecia and list the different  kinds of work you saw paramecia doing; also the kinds of work you  infer they can do. What organs have they to use? When there is no  organ to do a given thing, _e.g._ to digest food, how is the work  done?    2. What conditions are favorable to paramecia? Why are they so  numerous under favorable conditions?    3. What would you call a successful animal? Are paramecia successful?  Give reasons why they are or are not.      Comparative Study of Protozoa      To enlarge your idea of what a cell can do, spend as much more time  on the one-celled animals as your course will permit. Any stagnant  water may furnish several kinds. By means of reference books,  identify as many as you can. In each case notice:--    1. Its size, shape and general appearance, comparing and contrasting  it with paramecium.    2. Its usual surroundings, _i.e._ the conditions it has to meet.    3. The means it has of finding out facts about its surroundings.    4. The means it has of adjusting itself to its surroundings. For  example, is it stationary? If so, what does it do when conditions  change? Is it locomotory? If so, how effective is its locomotion?    5. What is its food? How does it find food?    6. Can it do as many kinds of work as paramecium can? Can it do any  that paramecium cannot do? If so, what?      Review and Library Questions on Protozoa      1. What are the characteristics which distinguish protozoa from other  animals?    2. What are the classes of protozoa? Characteristics of each class?    3. What is digestion? Where does it take place in the protozoa?    4. What results from the fact that the amoeba has no cell wall? (Give  at least two points.)    5. In what ways are paramecia more specialized than amoeba are? How  does their greater specialization show in their work?    6. What different methods of locomotion are shown among protozoa? By  what means is locomotion accomplished in each case?    7. What is encysting? Name some protozoa which encyst. How long may  an encysted animal live? When do they encyst? Why?    8. Give methods of reproduction among protozoa. Which method is  fitted for rapid multiplication, for withstanding drouth; for  renewing vitality?    9. Many scientists speak of protozoa as immortal. What argument is  there to support such a statement?    10. Why are no protozoa large animals? Give at least two reasons.    11. Why are protozoa so numerous? Why more numerous in stagnant  water?    12. Where are protozoa found?    13. Why are protozoa so widely distributed?    14. Write the probable history of a piece of chalk.    15. What connection is there between protozoa and some polishing  powders?    16. Where in the human body are malarial protozoa found? How are they  transferred from one human being to another? Why is there likely to  be more malaria in newly settled regions than in older ones? If you  were obliged to spend some time in a region where malaria existed,  what precautions would you take?    17. Name other diseases caused by protozoa. How are they fought?    18. What beneficial effect have some protozoa upon the water of  stagnant ponds and ditches? How may some forms injure water for  household purposes?    19. Give at least three reasons for thinking that protozoa are the  most ancient animals.    20. Why are protozoa of great importance to the world?      2. A STUDY OF SPONGES    _To show how cells loosely associated may work"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35006"],[0,"An Experimental Translocation of the Eastern Timber Wolf (#9)"],[1,"split and (2) where either had gone after the split,  mere backtracking would seem to be ruled out as explanation of how they  were able to rendezvous. Possibly No. 13 backtracked to the separation  point and then followed the others by scent, although this seems  unlikely because of the amount of time that had elapsed. Perhaps a  combination of memory of the general lay of the land, and some  backtracking and eventually howling and the crossing of each group's  fresh tracks could explain this remarkable feat.      Distances Traveled    The average daily straight-line distances (average of all known 24-hour  moves) traveled by Wolf No. 10 was 3.6 miles (5.8 km). For Wolf No. 11  and her associates it was 5.8 miles (9.3 km) for the period before the  settled Phase of their movements. The daily summer straight-line  movements of an immature radioed female in Ontario ranged from 0.0 to  3.5 miles (5.6 km) per day and averaged 1.0 (1.6 km) per day (Kolenosky  and Johnston 1967). Mech and Frenzel (1971) found that the average daily  straight-line distance traveled in Minnesota by three lone wolves was  2.0, 1.0 and 2.9 miles (3.2, 1.6, and 4.6 km), and a pack of five  averaged 2.5 miles (4.0 km) straight-line distance per day. A pack of  eight wolves in Ontario traveled actual distances of 0.0 to 13.2 miles  (21.1 km) per day during winter with an average movement of 4.4 miles  (7.1 km) per day (Kolenosky 1972).    Thus distances moved by both lone Wolf No. 10 and the pack were greater  than the distances reported for lone wolves and packs in their native  range. In Harger's (1970) study of homing in black bears, he also found  increased movement by displaced animals.    There was a general reduction in distances moved by the pack in May and  June after the wolves had settled in Iron County (Fig. 19), compared  with their earlier exploratory movements (Fig. 24). The movements during  the Settled Phase were similar to those reported from the studies in  Ontario and Minnesota.    [Illustration: _Fig. 24.--Straight-line distances between consecutive  locations for (A) Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13, (B) Wolf No. 10. (Gaps  between data points represent periods when no data were obtained.  Because these periods varied, and because distance traveled is partly a  function of duration between locations, it is only valid to grossly  compare distances from one period to the next.)_]      Home Range Size    At least in some areas, wolves are territorial (Mech 1972, 1973), and  the sizes of their home ranges are restricted somewhat by boundaries  established by the scent marks of surrounding packs (Peters and Mech  1975). The introduced wolves probably encountered no native packs with  established territories (Hendrickson et al. 1975), so they would not be  similarly restricted. The total area that wolves No. 11, 12, and 13  explored, 2,918 square miles (7,586 km^2), is larger than any reported  from the Great Lakes area and is comparable to home ranges of \"tundra  wolves\" (Mech 1970). Even the area in which they settled (May 7 to July  6) until the deaths of the males was 246 square miles (637 km^2), which  is larger than most reported ranges in the Great Lakes Region.    The deaths of the two males seemed to cause an increase in both daily  distance traveled and home range in Wolf No. 11. Essentially she began  traveling as extensively as do lone wolves in Minnesota (Mech and  Frenzel 1971).    The home range of Wolf No. 10 from March through mid-November, 346  square miles (895.7 km^2), was smaller than those of lone wolves in  Minnesota (Mech and Frenzel 1971). Apparently she was still expanding  her range when killed, however.      Selection of a Territory    The eventual settling of the pack of translocated wolves into a  territory would be expected because such behavior is characteristic of  wolves in other areas. The translocated pack did settle into a territory  of 246 square miles (637 km^2) after about 2 months (Fig. 18). Although  the region where they settled was not as remote as the release area, it  was more inaccessible than most of the rest of the 1,631 square mile  (4,224 km^2) area they explored after dispersing. As with the rest of  Upper Michigan, the pack's adopted territory was inhabited by a moderate  population of deer and beavers. It seems significant that this area is  one of three where a few native Michigan wolves are known to still exist  (Hendrickson et al. 1975).                             Vulnerability and Mortality    It could be expected that the translocated wolves would be more  vulnerable than wolves in their native environment. Although no data are  available from any previous study of translocated wild wolves, Harger's  (1970) investigation of displaced wild black bears showed that they were  more vulnerable. In our study, it was clear that during the Directional  Movement and Exploratory Phases Wolves No. 11, 12, and 13 were observed  by local residents an unusual number of times (Table 6). No. 10, which  did not explore such an extensive area and which spent considerable time  in a more remote area, was seen less (Table 5).    It is not clear why the wolves were not killed by humans during these  periods when they appeared so vulnerable. Perhaps the novelty of the  transplant coupled with the awareness that frequent aerial checks were  being made of the wolves had some effect. Furthermore, spring is not  generally a season of intensive hunting and trapping.    Whatever the explanation, the wolves did survive what seemed to be their  most vulnerable period. We do not believe that the deaths of the wolves  can be attributed to the conditions of their translocations. Instead, we  think that the most important factor in their demise was the  accessibility of the area to human beings and the attitudes of humans  towards wolves.    As indicated earlier, there appears to be an inverse relationship  between human density and wolf density in the Great Lakes Region (Table  1). Wolves are vulnerable to both accidental and deliberate mortality  from humans. For example, in winter 1947-48 at least 14 wolves were  struck by automobiles in northern Ontario (DeVos 1949). In Michigan, a  $15-$20 bounty still exists on coyotes, so these animals are commonly  shot and trapped. Because many people cannot distinguish wolves from  coyotes, and because wolves are often caught in the same kind of trap  sets made for coyotes, wolves might be killed accidentally.    Whether the killing of the translocated wolves was deliberate or  accidental is unknown except in the case of No. 11. No. 11 was caught  accidentally in a coyote trap, but was killed deliberately when the  trapper thought the animal might attack him. The best guess about No.  12, which was killed by a car, is that it was accidental. No. 10 and No.  13 were shot, but it is possible that the hunters in each case may have  mistaken them for coyotes. On the same day that No. 10 was killed, a  deer hunter shot a 76-lb. (34.5 kg) native Michigan wolf and turned  himself in to authorities, stating that he had thought it was a coyote,  and in March 1975 there was a similar occurrence.    Some Upper Michigan residents strongly opposed the transplant  experiment, largely out of concern for deer populations. The Northern  Michigan Sportsmen's Association passed a resolution against it, and the  Baraga County Wolf Hunters Association was formed with the express  purpose of interfering with the transplant effort. This association  offered a reward of $100 to a person killing a wolf (Fig. 25).  Supposedly 132 memberships at $1.50 each were sold.    It is unlikely that members of the Baraga County group killed the  experimental wolves, for it would be extremely difficult for anyone to  deliberately hunt down and kill a wolf. Most wolves that are shot  anywhere just happen to be seen by a few of the hundreds of thousands of  hunters that are afield or by local residents who keep a gun handy. Thus  the more accessible the area, and the higher the density of human  beings, the greater the chances that wolves will encounter such people.    Of course there was also excellent public support for the experiment.  With weekly newspaper accounts of the travels of the wolves, many people  began to develop an interest in, and sympathy for, the wolves. Some  letters in the newspapers expressed regret that the animals had been  killed.                              Food Habits and Predation    The translocated wolves apparently scavenged more in Michigan than in  Minnesota, at least shortly after their release. There were no known  garbage dumps within their native territory. The dumps in Michigan  presumably offered more readily available food during a time when the  wolves appeared preoccupied with extensive travel.    Nevertheless, the wolves did kill at least the three deer that we found,  and no doubt took several others. Although the sample size is small, the  results of our analysis of the condition of the deer are consistent with  those from other studies, indicating that wolves prey primarily on  debilitated deer (Pimlott et al. 1969, Mech and Frenzel 1971).    All three deer killed by the wolves were seriously malnourished, with 6%  or less fat content in the marrow of their femurs, or thigh bones. At  less than 25% fat in the marrow, serious malnutrition has developed  (Cheatum 1949). (In comparison, the femur fat of 59 doe deer killed by  automobiles in the Upper Peninsula in March and April 1974 averaged 46%,  according to Dr. L. D. Fay, Michigan Department of Natural Resources.)  In addition, one of the animals killed by the wolves had been wounded by  a bullet and had a broken leg; all three were does, and were over 4  years of age, a factor that Pimlott et al. (1969) and Mech and Frenzel  (1971) have also found important in wolf kills.                                An Alternate Approach    Although the time of release for the four wolves in this study was"]]]
