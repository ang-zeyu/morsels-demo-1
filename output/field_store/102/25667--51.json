We shall arrive before they move on  again.\"    Five minutes later they rode into a glade where a number of horsemen  were assembled. There was a shout as they were seen.    \"Why, Ernest,\" the marquis called as they approached, \"we thought  you had lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the  matter with your arm, and what have you got there?\"    \"We have got the demon wolf,\" Ernest replied; \"so you haven't had  all the sport to yourselves.\"    There was a general exclamation of surprise and almost incredulity,  and then every one rode over to meet them, and when it was seen  that the object slung between the two horses was really the demon  wolf there was a shout of satisfaction and pleasure. Again the  notes of the mort rang out through the woods, and every one crowded  round the lads to congratulate them and to examine the dead monster.  Ernest was lifted from his horse, for he was now reeling in  the saddle, and could not have kept his seat many minutes longer.  His wound was carefully examined, and the marquis pronounced  the shoulder-bone to be broken. A litter was made  and four of  the foresters hoisted him upon their shoulders, while four others  carried the wolf, still slung on its pole, behind the litter. While  the preparations were being made Harry had given the history of the  slaying of the wolf, saying that he owed his life to the quickness  and courage of Ernest.    \"And I owe mine to him,\" Ernest protested from the bank where he  was lying. \"The wolf would have killed me had he not slain it. I  was lucky in stopping it with a ball, but the rest was entirely a  joint affair.\"    The slaying of the demon wolf was so important an event that no  one thought of pursuing the hunt further that day. The other two  wolves were added to the procession, but they looked small and  insignificant beside the body of that killed by the boys. Harry  learned that no one had suspected that they had gone in pursuit of  the wolf.  A vigilant look-out had been kept all round the thicket,  while the dogs hunted it from end to end, but no signs had been seen  of it, and none were able to understand how it could have slipped  between the watchers unseen.    After the ravine had been thoroughly beaten the party had moved  off to another cover. On their way there the marquis had missed  the two boys. No one had seen them, and it was supposed that they  had loitered behind in the forest. Two or three notes of recall had  been blown, and then no one had thought more of the matter until  they rode into the glade when the second wolf had just been pulled  down by the pack.    It was afternoon when the hunting party arrived at the chateau.  Before they started homewards the marquis had sent off two horsemen;  one to Dijon to bring a surgeon with all speed to the chateau,  the other to tell the marquise that Ernest had been hurt, and that  everything was to be got in readiness for him; but that she was not  to make herself uneasy, as the injury was not a serious one.  The  messengers were charged strictly to say nothing about the death of  the demon wolf.    The marquise and her daughters were at the entrance as the party  arrived. The sight of the litter added to the anxiety which Ernest's  mother was feeling; but the marquis rode on a short distance ahead  to her.    \"Do not be alarmed, Julie,\" he said; \"the lad is not very seriously  hurt. He has been torn a bit by a wolf, and has behaved splendidly.\"    \"The messenger said he had been hurt by a wolf, Edouard; but how  came he to put himself in such peril?\"    \"He will tell you all about it, my dear. Here he is to speak for  himself.\"    \"Do not look so alarmed, mother,\" Ernest said as she ran down to  the side of the litter. \"It is no great harm, and I should not have  minded if it had been ten times as bad.\"    \"Bring up the wolf,\" the marquis said, \"and Harry, do you come  here and stand by Ernest's side. Madam la marquise,\" he went on,  \"do you see that great gray wolf? That is the demon wolf which has  for years been the terror of the district, and these are its slayers.  Your son and M. Sandwith, they, and they alone, have reaped the  glory which every sportsman in Burgundy has been so long striving  to attain; they alone in the forest, miles away from the hunt,  pursued and slew this scourge of the province.\"    He put his horn to his lips. The others who carried similar  instruments followed his example. A triumphant traralira was blown.  All present took off their hunting-caps and cheered, and the hounds  added their barking to the chorus.    \"Is it possible, Edward,\" the marquise said, terrified at the  thought of the danger her son must have run in an encounter with  the dreaded beast, \"is it possible that these two alone have slain  this dreadful wolf?\"    \"It is quite possible, my dear, since it has been done, though,  had you asked me yesterday, I should almost have said that it could  not be; however, there it is. Ernest and his brave young friend  have covered themselves with glory; they will be the heroes of the  department. But we must not stay talking here. We must get Ernest  into bed as soon as possible. A surgeon will be here very shortly.  I sent a messenger on to Dijon for one at the same time I sent to  you.\"    The marquis stayed outside for a few minutes while the domestics  handed round great silver cups full of spiced wine, and then bidding  good-bye to his guests entered the chateau just as the surgeon rode  up to the entrance.    \"Please tell us all about it,\" his daughters asked him when,  having seen the surgeon set the broken bone and bandage the wound,  operations which Ernest bore with stoical firmness, he went down  to the salon where his daughters were anxiously expecting him. \"All  about it, please. We have heard nothing, for Harry went upstairs  with Ernest, and has not come down again.\"    The marquis told the whole story, how the wolf had made his escape  unseen through the cordon round his lair, and had passed within the  sight of the two boys some distance away, and how they had hunted  it down and slain it. The girls shuddered at the story of the death  of the wood-cutter and the short but desperate conflict with the  wolf.    \"Then Ernest has the principal honour this time,\" the eldest girl  said.    \"It is pretty evenly divided,\" the marquis said. \"You see Ernest  brought the wolf to bay by breaking its shoulder, and struck the  first blow as it was flying upon Harry, who had been thrown from  his horse. Then, again, Ernest would almost certainly have been  killed had not Harry in his turn come to his assistance and dealt  it its mortal blows. There is not much difference, but perhaps the  chief honours rest with Ernest.\"    \"I am glad of that, papa,\" Mademoiselle de St. Caux said; \"it is  only right the chief honour should be with your son and not with  this English boy. He has had more than his share already, I think.\"    \"You would not think so if he had saved your life, sister,\" Jeanne  broke in impetuously. \"It was very brave of them both to kill the  wolf; but I think it was ever, ever so much braver to attack a  great mad dog without weapons. Don't you think so, papa?\"    \"I don't think you should speak so warmly to your elder sister,  Jeanne,\" the marquis said; \"she is a grown-up young lady, and you  are in the school-room. Still, in answer to your question, I admit  that the first was very much the braver deed. I myself should have  liked nothing better than to stand before that great wolf with my  hunting sword in my hand; but although if I had been near you when  the hound attacked you, I should doubtless have thrown myself before  you, I should have been horribly frightened and should certainly  have been killed; for I should never have thought of or carried so  promptly out the plan which Harry adopted of muzzling the animal.  But there is no need to make comparisons. On the present occasion  both the lads have behaved with great bravery, and I am proud that  Ernest is one of the conquerors of the demon wolf. It will start  him in life with a reputation already established for courage.  Now, come with me and have a look at the wolf. I don't think such  a beast was ever before seen in France. I am going to have him  stuffed and set up as a trophy. He shall stand over the  fireplace  in the hall, and long after we have all mouldered to dust our  descendants will point to it proudly, telling how a lad of their  race, with another his own age, slew the demon wolf of Burgundy.\"    Ernest was confined to his bed for nearly a month, and during  this time Harry often went long rides and walks by himself. In the  evening the marquis frequently talked with him over the situation  of the country and compared the events which had taken place with  the struggle of the English parliament with the king.    \"There was one point of difference between the two cases,\" he said  one evening. \"In England the people had already great power in  the state. The parliament had always been a check upon the royal  authority; and it was because the king tried to overrule parliament  that the trouble came about. Here our kings, or at least the ministers  they appointed, have always governed; often unwisely I admit, but  is it likely that the mob would govern better? That is the question.  At present they seem bent on showing their incapacity to govern  even themselves.\"    The Marquis de St. Caux had, in some respects, the thoughts and  opinions of the old school. He was a royalist pure and simple.  As  to politics, he troubled his head little about them. These were a  matter for ministers. It was their business to find a remedy for  the general ills. As to the National Assembly which represented  only the middle class and people, he regarded it with contempt.    \"Why, it was from the middle class,\" he said, \"that the oppressors  of the people were drawn. It is they who were farmers-general,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#9)"],[1,"een, Ashey Montreal, Dun. Wickham's Fancy, August  Brown are killing patterns in the Pennsylvania streams.    Trout change in their tastes by the month, week, day, hour, and  minute. There are flies among the list given for this or that month  that they will not rise to to-day or perhaps to-morrow, but surely  there are some among the list that will please them, and you have to  discover those particular flies, and so, as I have said before, 'tis  better to search among twenty-nine than twenty-nine hundred.    In July of a certain season I waded a stream in Pennsylvania and had  these flies with me: Quaker. Oak, Codun, Reuben Wood, White Miller,  Yellow Sallie, Hare's Ear, Iron Dun, Brown Palmer, Cahill, and a few  others. The first day I killed eighteen trout in fishing fifty yards  in a small stream running partly through a large open field and partly  through bushes, fishing from the left bank. Twelve were taken on a  brown palmer, four on a dark-gray midge, and two on a tiny  yellow-gold-brown fly. I fished three hours, in which time I received  exactly two hundred and fifteen strikes; eighteen, as I have said,  proved killing. I fished stealthily up and down the stream, hiding  here and there and making the most difficult of casts at all times. I  went up and down the little stream a half dozen times, never going  into the wood, but merely fishing from where the stream came out of  the wood to where it hid itself again beyond the field. Part of the  water I fished, as I say, was in underbush, but I did not leave the  field.    Now I am going to show you how the tastes of trout varied by minutes,  in two instances at least, and I desire you to know every little  detail. To well convince you that the casts I made were difficult, I  will say that my line became fastened in twigs, leaves, and bushes  every other toss. I had to put the flies through little openings no  larger than the creel head and take chances of getting the leader  caught while on the way, and after it was there and on its return. I  sometimes whipped twenty times at a little pool before I reached it.  There were logs, branches, mosses, cresses, leaves, and grasses to  avoid. The water in parts was swift and still, narrow, shallow, and  deep, sometimes being four feet wide and three feet deep, and then ten  feet wide and three inches deep; sometimes running smartly over bright  grasses or pebbles and light in color, and in other places lying dark  and still in pools made by logs and deep holes.    A tyro would have fished the ground in ten minutes and caught  nothing; some Anglers would have gone over it once in twenty-five  minutes and taken a half-dozen fish. I had the day to myself; I had  nowhere else to go; I was out for sport, recreation, and study,--not  fish, for I am a lover of nature in general,--and so I took three  hours at the play, and fished and observed inch by inch like a mink,  the king of trouters.    I say I had two hundred and fifteen strikes, out of which I killed  eighteen trout, and you are surprised. You think you could have done  better, much better, but I know you could not--you could not have done  as well as I did and I wish that I could put you to a test. I have  seen a _fontinalis_ rise to a small coachman twenty-six times,  snapping apparently at the feather each time, but never allowing  himself to be hooked nor hooking himself. He was playing. He was a  young trout, but an educated one, and well knew there was no danger if  he kept his wits about him. I have witnesses to this performance who  will substantiate my story, and I can easily further prove the  truthfulness of the statement by taking you to a stream where a  similar performance may be enacted. And I have seen an uneducated  trout rise and snap at a fly without taking it. The first one rose in  play, this one in curiosity--and there are trout that will rise in  anger. All of them may know the bait is not food. It is a mistake to  think that all brook trout will spurt from a fly the very second they  discover it is not real food, as it is an error to believe that all  brook trout will take the fly when they know it is the living thing.  All trout are not alike; they vary in their tastes and antics as they  do in color and size. Mind you, I speak only of one species here--the  true brook trout, _Salvelinus fontinalis_, and thus the material  should be interesting.    [Illustration: AN UNUSUAL WAY OF TAKING THE FLY]    The day I took my creel of eighteen was a fair one; we had rain the  day before; the water was clear and the stream was in ordinary  condition. The brown hackle which killed twelve of the eighteen was on  a No. 8 hook; the other two flies were tied on No. 16, as the hackle  should have been, for the fish were small and the stream was in a  small-fly condition and quite right for the daintiest leaders and the  finest midges. But the hackle seemed to please the trout; all sizes  appeared to jump at it. I hooked many that were not over three inches  long! Several times when taking my flies from the water for a new  cast, I lifted a poor little trout up in the air back of me, like the  scurvy fisherman who makes a practice of landing all his fish by  yanking them out. So you see it pays to be patient on the stream and  try all sorts of gentle tricks with _fontinalis_. You must not hurry;  you must not be coarse; you must not be careless and untidy with your  fly-book. Take your time, fish slowly, surely, and delicately. Be not  weary of the play: banish the thought of discouragement, keep at the  sport for sport alone, and study as you angle.    A little trout will rise to a fly he has missed one or more times; a  large trout will seldom do so. When you miss a big trout do not give  him back the fly for ten minutes, and then if you miss him again,  change the pattern, wait a little while, and he is once more ready for  the rise--if the new fly suits him.    I never raised a trout on the scarlet ibis fly. I believe it is a poor  color on the well-fished waters, just as I believe that all flies are  killing on wild streams. New trout will take old flies; old trout love  new ones and many old ones. Personally I like the sober colors in  flies for all seasons on all water, though I well appreciate the old  rule: \"When the day is bright and where the water is clear, small  flies and plain colors; in deep and dull waters and on dark days and  in the evening the brighter and larger ones.\" Trout do not in all  cases show their liking to flies in accordance with any condition of  weather or water, though as a rule it is advisable to use lighter  colors when the day and water are dull, which is not saying, however,  that fish will not rise to loud flies on bright days or sober flies in  dull weather, for the tastes of trout vary like the tastes of other  living things, and nothing can equal them in erraticness when  fly-feeding.    You must give _fontinalis_ sport, for he very often strikes for play  more than food, and, like every other living thing, loves a choice of  variety.    There is an old story that if the Angler's book has a pattern of fly  in exact imitation of the real fly upon the trout water, he has but to  join it as the stretcher to fill his creel. Ogden tells us in so many  words: \"Give not the trout an exact imitation of the real fly upon the  water, for your artificial fly will then be one in a thousand.  Something startling will please them better--loud gold body,  strange-colored wings--and an odd fellow may take it for sport if  nothing else.\"    While this is a good bit of advice, it does not seem right to me to  send it forth in such a sweeping manner. The question of whether we  should imitate nature in general fly building has long been in vogue.  Some say we should do so, and others that it does not matter. Both are  correct--there are times when we should copy the living flies, and  times when we should use those artificial things that have no  resemblance to nature's insects. I have come upon a water where the  trout were rising to the small dusky miller, and have, by putting on  the artificial fly of this order, taken a dozen beauties in good play.  It was because I arrived just in time; the trout were not tired of  their course. Perhaps twenty minutes later they would not have done  more than eyed my cast. In that case, even if the water were covered  with a species of the real fly, it would have been better to have  offered something different. Copy nature if the fish be devouring--not  alone because the fly is on the water; they may be tired of it.  Sometimes there are flies being taken that are not seen by the Angler,  for trout can snap a fly upon the wing. Fly-fishing is not an easy  pursuit; 'tis a real science. Rules are good, but we must not fail to  suit the rules to conditions.    No; you are not supposed to use the entire list, for to-day the trout  may not favor over two or three of them; to-morrow he may take six of  them--all different from those he may show a liking for to-day. It is  all very well for an Angler to take but three dozen coachmen and brown  and gray hackle for the Western trout, or any trout that is not  educated up to the standard of the trout that is fished for  incessantly, but I should not like to make a month's trouting trip and  take along only three kinds of flies, even if I had dozens of each of  the three and if my favorite quaker were one of the trio, no matter  where the stream--East. West, North, or South.    Some days after my catch of eighteen I visited the field again and  fished from the point where the stream entered the wood down to a  beautiful little waterfall. I took twenty-one of fair size--one on a  yellow Sallie, one on an oak fly, four on an Esquimaux dun, five on a  hare's ear, and nine on the quaker. This day I had ninety-three  rises--not as many as on the day I took the eighteen and had two  hundred and fifteen rises. The day was dark, the water very clear"]]]
