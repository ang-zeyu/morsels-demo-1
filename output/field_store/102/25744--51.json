[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#9)"],[1,"  The Duke, as utterly impassive as if he were deaf, turned musingly to  Lascaris.    'I heard one talk once,' said he, 'of a confederacy of republics, as who  should say, An army all serfs.  Words! The tails must obey the heads.  Every ox knows it.'    'Saving the frog-ox,' giggled the Greek, 'who bursts himself in  emulation.'    'Ah!' murmured the Duke, 'the frog-ox: see us tickle his self-puffery.'    He feigned to catch sight all at once of Montano. His eyes opened wide  in astonishment: he held out his hands.    'What!' he cried, 'the man of visions! the very man! Come hither, old  friend.  I was but now speaking of thee.'    His guards permitting him, Montano sullenly mounted the steps, and stood  facing the tyrant.  His arms hung very plainly fettered before him; but  the other never took his languid, smiling eyes from his face.    'Galeazzo,' said the scholar, harsh and quick, 'I did not write the  epigrams; but no matter.  You seek to make an example; I submit myself.  It is the despot's part to lay hands on order and sobriety.  Despatch,  then.  Thou wilt serve my ends better than thine own. Every blow to  freedom is a link gone from thy mail.'    The Duke listened to him as if in bland wonder.    'Epigrams!  An example!' he exclaimed.  'O, surely there is some mistake  here.'    The thick brows of the prisoner contracted over his leaden eyes.  He set  his teeth, breathing between them. Galeazzo appealed to Lascaris:--    'Know'st aught of this?'    The Greek shook his head ineffably, licking his lips.    'No,' said Galeazzo, 'nor is it conceivable that my old friend and  reprover should condescend to that meaner scourge.  Jesu! for one of his  learning and condition to incur the fate of the common lampooner. Why, I  mind me how one was invited to a ragout minced of his own tongue.'    'Yes, Illustrious.'    'And another to having his couplets scored in steel on the soles of his  feet.'    'Yes, Illustrious.'    'And yet another to boiling eggs under his arm-pits, since he was clever  at hatching those winged epigrams'--he turned smoothly again to the  tutor--'but not clever, as thou art, at reforming constitutions.'    He fell back, with a sleek and hateful smile; then, sighing suddenly,  advanced his body again.    'I am troubled, Montano, I am troubled, and, since you chance to be  here----'    He yielded the explanation to Lascaris.    'I weary of relating.  Tell him of my symptoms, thou'--and he sunk once  more into his cushions.    The Greek diagnosed, his shifty eyes refusing to encounter the hard  inquisition of the other's:--    'His Magnificence is of late ever conscious of a face behind him,  mournful and threatening.  And still, if he turns to challenge it, it is  behind him; and still behind, maddening him with a thought of something  he can never overtake.'    Galeazzo fixed his burning eyes on the prisoner, as if, through all his  mockery, the hunger of a hopeless hope betrayed his soul.    'Canst _thou_ strike it away,' he whispered hoarsely, 'or at least tell  me what it is?'    Montano growled:--    'Ghosts, and dead years, and eye-particles!  This trash of  pseudo-science--a saltimbanco braying in a doctor's skin!  Less licence,  Galeazzo, and more exercise--'tis all contained in that.  This vision is  but a swimming blot of bile.'    He was really half-deceived, half-convinced.  The Duke seemed to listen  reassured, then slowly rose, and, with an ingratiatory smile, patted his  erst tutor's shoulder.    'Old honest friend,' he said, 'and ever true to the Roman in thee!  Thou  hast spoken as one might expect. Bile, is it--bile? and little wonder in  this upset of constitutions.  Ebbene! we will take instant means to  throw it off.'    He made a sign to the chief of the guard below.    'Andrea!'    Lascaris slunk back with a little gloating smile.  The officer brought  up his men about Montano.  The Duke murmured softly:--    'Take good Messer Cola, and--' he paused a little, gazing winningly into  his captive's surprised, splenetic face--'and have him soundly flogged  before the gate-house--to the bone, Andrea, tell Messer Jacopo.'    Before the luring treachery of this stroke the prisoner stood for one  moment shocked, aghast.  The next, as the guard seized him, he broke  into a storm of vituperations and blasphemies, calling upon all the gods  of Rome to protect him from a monster.  Andrea crushed his mailed hand  down on his writhing lips; he was dragged away struggling and screaming.  As he disappeared Galeazzo descended mincingly to the hall, bent on  pursuing the show.  A cloud of courtiers, male and female flocked, like  rooks following a plough, in his wake.  As he left the citadel and was  crossing the outer ward, two ladies--one a young woman in her late  twenties; the other a slim, pale girl of thirteen--broke from a group of  attendants, and came, wreathed in one embrace, to accost him.  The  elder, looking in his face with a certain questioning anxiety, spoke him  with a propitiatory smile and sigh:--    'Galeazino, O thou little sweetest burden on my heart!'    The endearment was really an inquiry, a warning; for there was a  foreboding madness in his eyes.  He made as if he would have struck her  from his path.  Her child companion caught his wrist with a merry cry:--    'My little father, whither sportest thou without thy women?'    He changed the direction of his hand and flipped the younger's cheek.    'Come, then, chuck,' said he.  'There is a frolic toward that will speed  an idle hour.'    She caught up her skirts and followed him, as did the other, but less  closely.    The gatehouse commanded from its battlements an open panorama of the  town as far as the piazza of the duomo.  Immediately to its front, in a  bare extended space, stood the whipping-post, a stout beam set on end on  a stage and furnished with hooks and chains.  Already on the ground  beside this (by preconcerted arrangement indeed) was a certain  functionary, much respected of Milan.  This was Messer Jacopo, the high  court executioner--one, by virtue of his dealings in blood, almost on an  equality with the master herald himself.  Immobile and voiceless, he  stood there like a model in an armoury. A short shirt of mail, and over  it a scarlet jerkin with a plain dagger at the waist; hose of sober  grey; a bonnet and shoes of black velvet, the first adorned with a red  quill, the second with red rosettes; gorget and steel gauntlets--such  was the whole of Messer Jacopo, save for the wooden, inessential detail  of his face and its fixed eyes of glass.  There was something painfully  human, by contrast, in his understrappers, two or three of whom stood at  hand in leathern aprons--men of a rich, moist physique and greasy palms,  and jocund, slaughter-house expression.  These were on bantering terms  with the mob, with all that loose raff of the neighbourhood, which had  come streaming and pushing and chattering to witness the sport.  It was  not often that the rats of the quarter Giovia had a master of philosophy  to desert.    They had not long to wait.  Almost simultaneously a little surging group  appeared at the gates, and a throng of gay heads above the ramparts.  The jostle and delighted whisper went among the crowd.  What proportion  would the scourging of a prince's tutor bear to the punishment it  avenged?  It surely would not be allowed to lose by procrastination.  They craned their necks to catch an early sight of the victim.  One of  the assistants whipped experimentally through his fingers a thick, cruel  thong of bullock-hide.  It clacked a dry tongue.    'Be quiet, thirsty one,' he cried boisterously.  'In a moment thou shalt  drink thyself to a sop.'    Up on the ramparts the ladies, with bright, inquisitive eyes, stood by  their lord.  The girl Catherine, petted love-child of her father, hugged  confidingly to his arm.    'Padre mio,' she said, 'how sweet the world looks from here!  I could  fancy we were all Lazaruses, laughing down on that wicked Dives!'                                        *CHAPTER V*      Messer Lanti and his party entered Milan, in a very subdued mood, by the  Gate of Saint Mark. It had been with an emotion beyond words that Bembo  had found himself approaching the walls of this fair city of his dreams.  The prosperous contado, watered in every direction by broad dykes; the  clustering vines and saintly-hued olive gardens; the busy peasantry; the  richness of the very wayside shrines, had all appeared to speak a  content and holiness with which the perverse passions of men were at  such bitter variance.  The discrepancy confounded, as it was presently  upon a fuller experience to inspire, him.  Here in one land, incessantly  jostling and reacting on one another, were a devotional and a sensuous  fervour, both exhibiting a lust of beauty at fever-heat; were a gross  superstition and an excellent reason; were a powerful priestcraft and a  jeering scepticism--all drawing from the forehead of a Papacy, which,  latterly pledged to the most unscrupulous temporal self-aggrandisement,  was reverenced for the vicarship of a poor and celibate Christ.  Issuing, equipped with an artless conventual purpose, from the cool  groves of his cloister, he found a land dyed in blood and the blue of  heaven, festering under God's sun, and rejoicing in the colour schemes  of its sores.  On what principle could he study to sweeten this paradox  of a constitution, where health was enamoured of disease?  '_Deus meus,  in te confido_,' he prayed, with hands clasped fervently upon his  breast; '_Non erubescam, neque irrideant me inimici mei_!  O Lord, give  me the vision to find and show to others a path through this beautiful  wilderness!'    As the long walls of the town, broken at intervals into turrets,  broadened before him, violet against a deep, cloudless sky, his ecstasy  but increased--he held out his arms.    'O thou,' he murmured, 'that I have hungered for, looking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#9)"],[1," Vitelli,  now publicly proclaimed throughout the duchy, was by many greedily  seized.    Borgia, having secured fourteen distinguished inhabitants of Urbino  as hostages, ordered that the fortresses left by agreement in  the hands of Guidobaldo should be attempted: that of Maiuolo was  accordingly surprised about the beginning of May, and easily reduced.  S. Leo being better provided, as well as considered impregnable,  its siege was more methodically undertaken, and levies were ordered  to reinforce the assailants. The amount of public sympathy with the  cause may be estimated from Baldi's assertion that, in the city of  Urbino, the utmost difficulty was experienced in raising eight foot  soldiers with one month's pay. Eight hundred Gascons in the French  service were obtained from De la Tremouille; but these, having  turned the siege into a sort of blockade, were dispersed among the  neighbouring villages, where, on the 5th of June, their revels  were suddenly interrupted by unknown assailants, who disappeared  as mysteriously as they had issued from the mountain defiles,  leaving many of the besiegers slain or wounded. The surrounding  peasantry, catching the enthusiasm, rushed to arms, and, but for  extraordinary exertions, the whole duchy would have once more  been out for their legitimate lord. News of this movement having  reached the Duke early in July, he obtained from Florence free  passage through her territory, and from the Venetians a promise of  passive support, and thereupon put himself into communication with  his principal adherents, by means of letters carried by persons of  low condition, many of which were unfortunately intercepted by the  lieutenant-governor of Urbino. His people were thus kept in a fever  of expectation; but, finally, this plan of an invasion was abandoned,  whereupon he repaired to Mantua, to his brother-in-law the Marquis,  who had been taken into the French service under De la Tremouille,  and engaged him to represent to Louis the hardships of his case, and  the danger of Borgia's excessive ambition.    Disgusted with their ignominious overthrow at S. Leo, the Gascons  assumed the habitual licence of such mercenaries, by soon taking  their departure from         \"The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,       The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,       And palls the patience of his baffled heart.\"    The siege was nevertheless maintained by the commandant of Romagna;  but the place was ably and spiritedly defended by Ottaviano Fregoso,  who will soon attract our notice in other scenes. Marini has recorded  another act of romantic daring by the same Brizio who, in the  preceding year, had surprised the place. Fregoso's tiny garrison  being greatly exhausted by the long blockade, he, with one Marzio,  made his way, during a violent storm of rain, over the rocks, and  through the beleaguering force, and reached a castle near Mantua  where Guidobaldo then was. In vain these emissaries besought him for  a reinforcement of two hundred men; for, thinking it would only waste  their gallantry by prolonging a hopeless struggle, he thankfully  declined their proposal. At length their urgency obtained twenty-five  men who happened to be at hand, and with these they returned to  the leaguer. Marzio, boldly presenting himself to the commandant,  volunteered to join the besiegers with his little party, which being  accepted, he advanced them under the walls, whence, having been  recognised by the garrison, they made a rush to the upper gate,  and were received into the fortress ere the trick was discovered.  By this timely succour, S. Leo was enabled to hold out until the  restoration of its rightful sovereign; and its brave defenders did  not even falter at the threat of summary vengeance upon their wives  and families, who had been brought to the palace of Urbino to answer  for their obstinacy.           *       *       *       *       *    Christendom was now to be appalled by a fearful catastrophe, which  fitly closed the career of the Borgias, diverting their wonted  weapons to their own destruction, for--         \"'Tis sure a law of retribution just       That turns the plotters' arts against themselves.\"[7]    [Footnote 7:         \"Neque enim lex aequior ulla       Quam necis artifices arte perire sua.\" OVID. _Ar. Amat._ i. 655.]    Alexander and his son perceiving that they could no longer turn to  good account the co-operation of Louis for their grasping schemes,  began to look round for new combinations: having squeezed the orange  they were ready to throw aside the rind. But to such projects their  exhausted treasury offered serious obstacles. To supply it they  had recourse, on an extended scale, to an expedient which they had  invented, and already occasionally employed,--that of poisoning the  richest cardinals, seizing on their treasures, and selling their  vacant hats to the highest bidders. Among the most recent and wealthy  of the sacred college was Adrian of Corneto, and he was therefore  selected as next victim. On the 12th of August, the Pope and Cesare  invited him to sup in the Belvidere casino of the Vatican, and the  latter sent forward a supply of poisoned wine, in charge of his  butler, with strict injunctions not to serve it until specially  desired by himself. Several other cardinals were to partake of the  banquet, and, probably, were intended to share the drugged potion.  Alexander had been assured by an astrologer that, so long as he had  about him the sacramental wafer, he should not die; and, accordingly,  he constantly carried it in a little golden box; but, having on that  evening forgotten it upon his toilet, he sent Monsignor Caraffa,  afterwards Paul IV., to fetch it. Meanwhile, overcome by the dog-day  heat, he called for wine. The butler was gone to fetch a salver of  peaches, which had been presented to his Holiness, and his deputy,  having received no instructions as to the medicated bottles, offered  a draught from them to the Pope. He greedily swallowed it, and his  example was more moderately followed by Cesare; thus,                             \"Even-handed justice       Commends the ingredients of the poisoned chalice       To their own lips.\"    Scarcely had they taken their seats at the table, when the two  victims successively fell down insensible, from the virulence of the  poison, and were carried to bed. The Pontiff rallied so far as to  recover consciousness, and to linger for about a week, but at length  sank under the shock and the fever which supervened, his age being  seventy-one, and his constitution enervated by long debauchery. The  last sacraments were duly administered, and it was remarked that,  during his illness, he never alluded to his children Cesare and  Lucrezia, through life the objects of an overweening, if not criminal  fondness, in whose behalf most of his outrages upon the peace and the  rights of mankind had been committed. His death occurred on the 18th  of August.[*8]    [Footnote *8: There is no authentic basis for this story. Rome was  in a pestilential condition in August, and the Pope, Cesare, and  the Cardinal Hadrian were all stricken with fever, which a supper  in the open air was surely not unlikely to produce. Alexander was  so detested that the strangeness of his death suggested poison at  once to his enemies. Cf. CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p.  49. An excellent essay on _The Poisonings attributed to the Borgia_  will be found in CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p. 301 _et  seq._]    Such is the account of this awful retribution given by Tommasi,  from which most other narratives but slightly deviate as to dates  or immaterial details. Another version, however, occurs in Sanuto's  Diaries, which, being contemporary, and probably supplied from the  diplomatic correspondence of the Signory, merits notice, and has  not been hitherto published. The Cardinal of Corneto, who figures  prominently in this narrative, was made collector for Peter's pence  in England, and Bishop of Hereford, from whence he was translated  to Bath and Wells. We shall find him compromised in Petrucci's  conspiracy against Leo X., but the following charge of pope-poisoning  is new.    \"The Lord Adrian Castillense of Corneto, Cardinal Datary, having  been desired by the Pope to receive him and Duke Valentino at supper  in his vineyard, his Holiness supplying the eatables, this Cardinal  presumed the invitation to be planned for his death by poison, so  that the Duke might obtain his money and benefices, which were  considerable. In order to save himself there seemed but one course,  so, watching his opportunity, he summoned the Pontiff's steward,  whom he knew intimately, and on his arrival received him alone in  a private chamber, where 10,000 ducats were laid out: these he  desired him to accept for love of him, offering him also more of his  property, which he declared he could continue to enjoy only through  his assistance, and adding, 'You certainly are aware of the Pope's  disposition, and I know that he and the Duke have designed my death  by poison through you; wherefore I pray you have pity on me and spare  my life.' The steward, moved with compassion on hearing this, at  length avowed the plan concerted for administering the poison; that,  after the supper, he was to serve three boxes of confections, one  for the Pope, another for the Duke, and a third for the Cardinal,  the last being poisoned; so they arranged that the service of the  table should be contrived in such a way that the Pontiff might eat  of the Cardinal's poisoned box, and die. On the appointed day, the  Pope having arrived at the vineyard with the Duke, the Cardinal  threw himself at his Holiness' feet and kissed them, saying he had  a boon to request, and would not rise until it were granted. The  Pope assuring him of his consent, he continued, 'Holy Father! on the  lord's coming to his servant's house, it is not meet that the servant "]]]
