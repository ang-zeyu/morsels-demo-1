In  some specimens the dorsum is nearly uniform pale green or tan with a few  small, dark spots. The hind limbs are marked by dark transverse bands,  usually three or four each on the thigh and shank, and two or three on  the tarsus. The webbing on the feet is brown. The loreal region is pale  green, bordered above by a narrow, dark brown canthal stripe extending  from the nostril to the orbit, which is bordered above by a narrow,  bronze-colored stripe extending from the nostril along the edge of the  eyelid to a point above the tympanum. The upper lip is white. A broad  dark brown mark extends posteriorly from the orbit and encompasses the  tympanum to a point above the insertion of the forelimb. The flanks are  dark brown with many pale blue, rounded spots, giving the impression of  a pale blue ground color with dark brown mottling enclosing spots. The  anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are dark brown with many  small pale blue spots. The inner surfaces of the shank and tarsus are  colored like the posterior surfaces of the thighs. Pale blue spots are  usually present on the proximal segments of the second and third toes. A  distinct white stripe is present on the outer edge of the tarsus and  fifth toe; on the tarsus the white stripe is bordered below by dark  brown. A white stripe also is present on the outer edge of the forearm  and fourth finger. The anal region is dark brown, bordered above by a  narrow transverse white stripe. The throat in breeding males is dark,  grayish brown with white flecks.    No geographic variation in the dorsal coloration is evident. Specimens  from the eastern part of the range (Piedras Negras and Chinaja,  Guatemala) have bold, dark reticulations on the flanks enclosing large  pale blue or pale green spots, which fade to tan in preservative.  Specimens from Oaxaca and Veracruz characteristically have finer dark  reticulations on the flanks enclosing smaller blue spots; in many of  these specimens the ventrolateral spots are smallest and are white.    All living adults are easily recognized by the presence of pale, usually  blue, spots on the flanks and thighs. Individuals under cover by day  have a tan dorsum with dark brown markings. A hiding individual at  Chinaja, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (KU 55936), had a pale tan dorsum when  found; later the dorsal color changed to chocolate brown. A pale green  patch was present below the eye; the spots on the posterior surfaces of  the thighs were pale blue, and those on the flanks were yellowish green.  A calling male obtained 10 kilometers north-northwest of Chinaja (KU  55934) was reddish brown when found at night; later the dorsal color  changed to pale tan. A green patch below the eye was persistent. Usually  these frogs are green at night. The coloration of an adult male (KU  87201) from 11 kilometers north of Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, was  typical: \"When calling dorsum pale green; later changed to dull  olive-green. Flanks dark brown with pale blue spots in axilla and groin  and bluish white flecks on mid-flank. Anterior and posterior surfaces of  thighs, inner surfaces of shanks, and median dorsal surfaces of tarsi  dark brown with blue spots. Canthal and postorbital stripes dark  chocolate brown; labial stripe creamy white. Forearm, tarsal, and anal  stripes pale cream-color. Throat dark brown with yellow flecks; belly  and ventral surfaces of limbs creamy buff; webs pinkish tan; iris deep  bronze, brown below pupil.\" (Duellman, field notes, June 24, 1964.)    Some individuals have both green and brown coloration in life. An  individual obtained at night on the south slope of Volcan San Martin,  Veracruz, Mexico, had a pale tan dorsum changing peripherally to pale  green. The dorsal markings were dark brown and dark olive-green.    In contrast to the color-changes noted above, the labial region below  the eye is always pale green, and pale spots are always present on the  flanks and thighs in adults. The iris is invariably golden or bronze  above and darker, usually brown, below. Minute black flecks are present  on the iris, and in some individuals these flecks are so numerous that  the eye appears gray.    Recently metamorphosed young have pale tan flanks, and the posterior  surfaces of the thighs are orange-yellow; pale spots are absent. A  juvenile (KU 55935) from Chinaja, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, having a  snout-vent length of 35.0 mm. was pale yellowish tan above with  olive-green markings; the flanks were dark brown with pale blue spots,  and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs were uniform  bright tomato red. A juvenile (UMMZ 121298), 18.6 mm. in snout-vent  length, from the southeast slope of Volcan San Martin, Veracruz, Mexico,  had pale tan flanks lacking blue spots, but had red thighs. Apparently  the ontogenetic changes in coloration proceed as follows: (1) flanks  pale tan and thighs orange-yellow, both lacking spots, (2) flanks pale  tan and thighs red, both lacking spots, (3) flanks dark brown with blue  spots and thighs red, lacking spots, and (4) flanks and thighs dark  brown, both having pale blue spots.    _Natural History._--_Smilisca cyanosticta_ inhabits humid tropical  forest and cloud forest from the lowlands to elevations of about 1200  meters in Los Tuxtlas and to about 900 meters in northern Oaxaca. In  these moist environments the frogs apparently are active throughout the  year. Active individuals have been obtained in January, July, and August  in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, in June and July in northern Oaxaca, in  February and March at Chinaja, Guatemala, and Taylor and Smith reported  (1945:589) activity in May at Piedras Negras, Guatemala. Calling males  were observed as follows; in a rain barrel 11 kilometers north of Vista  Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, on June 23-28, 1964; in a quiet pool in a  stream 8 kilometers south of Yetla, Oaxaca, Mexico, in July, 1963 (Dale  L. Hoyt, personal communication); in and near springs flowing into a  stream at Dos Amates, Veracruz, Mexico, on August 4, 1959 (Douglas  Robinson, personal communication); and in a water-filled depression in a  log 10 kilometers west-northwest of Chinaja, Guatemala, on March 13,  1960. Taylor and Smith (1945:589) reported that individuals were found  at night on the ground at the edge of temporary pools at Piedras Negras,  Guatemala, on May 28-29, 1939. A clasping pair was found on a rock at  the edge of a small stream on the south slope of Volcan San Martin,  Veracruz, Mexico, on July 11, 1959 (Douglas Robinson, personal  communication).    Only one individual has been observed in a tree at night. In the  daytime, individuals were found in elephant ear plants (_Xanthosoma_) at  Chinaja, Guatemala.    The breeding call consists of one or two moderately short notes that are  lower pitched than those of _S. baudini_, but higher pitched than those  of _S. phaeota_. Each note has a duration of 0.25 to 0.45 seconds and is  repeated at intervals of one-half minute to several minutes. Each note  is a vibrant \"waunk,\" having 110 to 180 pulses per second and dominant  frequency of 1600 to 2100 cycles per second (Pl. 10B).    Apparently the eggs are deposited as loose clumps in the water. In eggs  in the yolk plug stage of development, the diameter of the embryo is  about 2.3 mm.; that of the outer envelope is 4.0 mm. Hatchling tadpoles  have total lengths of 5.8 to 6.5 mm. and body lengths of 2.8 to 3.1 mm.  The external gills are moderately long, slender, and filamentous; the  yolk sac is still moderately large. The body and anterior part of the  caudal musculature are dark brown; posteriorly the caudal musculature is  pale brown. The caudal fins are creamy tan. The oral discs are large and  ovoid. The growth of the tadpole is summarized in Table 10.    A typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 87652 from 11 km. N  Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico) can be described as follows:    Body length 9.5 mm.; tail length 15.5 mm.; total length 25.0 mm.; body  slightly wider than deep; snout rounded laterally, broadly ovoid  dorsally; eyes widely separated, directed dorsolaterally; nostril about  midway between eye and tip of snout; mouth anteroventral; spiracle  sinistral, slightly posterior to midpoint of body and slightly below  midline; anal tube dextral; caudal musculature slender, barely curved  upward distally; dorsal fin not extending onto body, depth of dorsal fin  slightly more than that of ventral fin on mid-length of tail; dorsal  part of body dark brown; ventral surfaces transparent, lacking pigment;  posterior edge of body pale cream-color; caudal musculature creamy white  with interconnected brown spots; caudal fins transparent with small  brown blotches on dorsal fin and posterior half of ventral fin; iris  coppery bronze in life (Fig. 12). Mouth small, median part of upper lip  bare; rest of mouth bordered by single row of bluntly rounded papillae;  lateral fold present; tooth rows 2/3; all tooth-rows approximately equal  in length; second upper row broadly interrupted medially; other rows  complete; upper beak moderately deep, forming broad arch with slender  lateral processes; lower beak slender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks  finely serrate (Fig. 15C).    All tadpoles having fully developed mouth parts have 2/3 tooth rows.  Little variation is noticeable in coloration. In many specimens the  posterior edge of the body is dark brown instead of pale cream-color.  Mottling is rather dense on the caudal fins in all specimens; in some  individuals pigment is concentrated along the anterior one-third of the  lateral groove. In life the body is dark brown with greenish gold flecks  ventrally; the caudal musculature is gray.    In each of two recently metamorphosed young the snout-vent length is  14.0 mm.

His expedition was ill supplied, but fortunately returned  without any severe losses. His route lay through North Cachar to  Berrimeh; thence, via Razepima to Samagudting and Mohung Deejood;  beyond gaining local knowledge there was no result, except perhaps  to show that a well-armed party could march where it liked through  the hills.    In December 1839, Mr. Grange again visited the hills, and, excepting  1843, an expedition was sent into the hills every year till 1846  when a post was permanently established at Samagudting. None of these  expeditions had any really satisfactory result. The Angamis submitted  to our troops at the time, and directly we retreated, murder and the  carrying off of slaves re-commenced. The establishment of the post  at Samagudting had the effect of improving our relations with the  people of that village; and Mozuma was always inclined to be friendly;  beyond this nothing was accomplished.    In August 1849, Bog Chand Darogal, a brave Assamese who was in charge  of Samagudting, was murdered by one of the clans of Mozuma, owing  to the rash way in which he interfered in a dispute with another  clan, which latter remained faithful to us, and thus led to another  expedition on a large scale. Finally, in December 1850, a large force  was sent up with artillery. Kohima, which had sent a challenge, was  destroyed on February 11th, 1851. In this last engagement over three  hundred Nagas were killed, and our prestige thoroughly established. We  might then, with great advantage to the people and our own districts,  have occupied a permanent post, and while protecting our districts  that had suffered so sorely from Naga raids, have spread civilisation  far and wide among the hill-tribes. Of course we did nothing of the  kind; on such occasions the Government of India always does the wrong  thing; it was done now, and, instead of occupying a new position,  we retreated, even abandoning our old post at Samagudting, and only  maintaining a small body of Shan Militia at Dimapur. The Nagas ascribed  our retreat to fear, the periodical raids on our unfortunate villages  were renewed, and unheeded by us; and finally, in 1856, we withdrew  the detachment from Dimapur and abandoned the post.    After that, the Nagas ran riot, and one outrage after another was  committed. In 1862 the guard and village of Borpathar were attacked  and, one Sepoy and thirteen villagers killed and two children carried  off as slaves, but no notice was taken; it was not till 1866 that,  wearied out by repeated outrages and insults, we determined to  establish ourselves in the hills, and once for all put down raiding.    A kind of vague boundary between Manipur and the Naga Hills had been  laid down in 1842, by Lieutenant Biggs on our part, and Captain Gordon  on the part of the Durbar, but in 1851, when utterly sick of Naga  affairs, we determined on a policy of non-intervention, permission in  writing was given to the Durbar to extend its authority over the Naga  villages on our side of the border. This must be remembered later  on. Failing any intention on our part to annex the hills, it would  have been good policy to have re-organised the Manipur territory,  and to have aided the Maharajah to annex and subdue as much as he  could under certain restrictions. Had this been done we should have  saved ourselves much trouble. Personally, I would rather see the  Naga Hills properly administered by ourselves, but the strong rule  of Manipur would have been far better than the state of things that  prevailed for many years after 1851.                CHAPTER IV.        Value of keeping a promise--Episode of Sallajee--Protection given      to small villages, and the large ones defied--\"Thorough Government      of India\" views--A plea for Christian education in the Naga Hills.      Almost from the day I took charge, I let it be known that I was,  as natives say, \"a man of one word,\" and that if I said a thing,  I meant it. If I promised a thing, whether a present or punishment,  the man got it; and if I refused any request, months of importunity  would not move me. This rule saved me much time and worry; instead  of being pestered for weeks with some petition, in the hope that my  patience would be worn out, I simply said Yes, or No, and the people  soon learned that my decision was final. Later on, during the Naga  Hills campaign, I found that my ways had not been forgotten, and this  made dealing with the people much simpler than it might have been.    A certain number of the villages kept one or two men, as the case  might be, constantly in attendance on me to represent them. These were  called delegates, and received ten rupees each per mensem. I gave the  strictest orders to these men not to engage in their tribal raids,  but to remain absolutely neutral. Sephema had two delegates, Sejile  and Sallajee by name, and, one day, it was reported to me that the  last had joined in a raid by his village on Mozuma, and I instantly  summoned him to attend and put him on his trial for disobeying a lawful  order. Some wise-acres in the place shook their heads, and doubted if  I were strong enough to punish, or the advisability of doing so; but  I held that an order must be obeyed, otherwise, it was no use issuing  orders, also, that this was an opportunity of making an example. Of  course it was an experiment, as no one had been punished before for  a similar offence, and I well knew that resistance on his part would  mean that to assert my authority I must attack and destroy Sephema,  but I felt the time had come for vigorous action, and was prepared to  go through with it. I tried Sallajee, found him guilty, and sentenced  him to six months' imprisonment in Tezpore jail. In giving judgment,  I said, \"You have not been guilty of a disgraceful offence, therefore,  I do not sentence you to hard labour, and shall not have you bound or  handcuffed like a thief; but, remember, you cannot escape me, so do  not be foolish enough to run away from the man in charge of you.\" I  then sent him in charge of two police sepoys through one hundred miles  of forest, and he underwent his imprisonment without attempting to get  away. Right thankful I was that my experiment succeeded. Sallajee lived  to fight against us, during the campaign in the Naga Hills in 1879-80.    The orders of the Government of India were strictly against our  responsibilities being extended. We took tribute from Samagudting,  but it was the only village we considered as under our direct rule,  and that only so long as it suited us. Before leaving Calcutta, the  Foreign Secretary said to me emphatically, when I urged an extension  of our sway--\"but those villages (the Angami Nagas) are not British  territory, and we do not want to extend the 'red line.'\"    However, Government may lay down rules, but as long as they are not  sound, they cannot be kept to by artificial bonds, and sooner or later  events prove stronger than theories. The fact is, that no Government of  late years had ever interested itself in the Eastern Frontier tribes,  except so far as to coax them or bribe them to keep quiet. The Abors  on the banks of the Burrhampooter had long been paid \"blackmail,\"  and any subterfuge was resorted to, that would stave off the day of  reckoning which was nevertheless inevitable.    As regards the Nagas, this timidity was highly reprehensible. We had  acquired such a prestige, that the least sign of vigorous action on  our part was sure to be crowned with success, so long as we did not  make some foolish mistake.    The people in the hills knew that we objected to the system of raiding,  and could not understand why, such being the case, we did not put it  down, and ascribed our not doing so to weakness, wherein they were  right, and inability wherein they were wrong. The less powerful  villages would at any time have been glad of our protection, and  one of the most powerful--Mozuma, was anxious to become subject to  us. Offers of submission had been made once or twice, but no one liked  to take the responsibility of going against the policy and orders  of the Government. At last an event occurred which brought things  to a crisis, and forced us either to adopt a strong policy, or make  ourselves contemptible by a confession of weakness, and indifference.    Towards the end of March 1874, a deputation came to me from the  village of Mezeffina begging for protection against Mozuma, with whom  they had a feud, and from whom for some reason or other they daily  expected an attack. They offered to become British subjects and pay  revenue in return for protection. I considered the matter carefully,  and before I had given my decision, crowds of old people, and women  carrying their children, came in asking me to save their lives. I at  once decided to grant their request, and promised them what they asked,  on condition that they paid up a year's tribute in advance. This they  at once did, and I immediately sent a messenger to proclaim to Mozuma  that the people of Mezeffina were British subjects, and to threaten  them or any one else with dire vengeance if they dared to lay hands  on them. Our new subjects asked me and my wife, to go out and receive  their submission in person, an invitation which we accepted, and next  day a large number of men turned up to carry my wife, and our baggage,  and that of our escort, consisting of twenty men.    The Mezeffina men rested for the night in Samagudting, and early on  the following morning we started, and reached the village in good  time, where we were received with great demonstrations of respect. We  spent the night there, and then were conveyed back to Samagudting,  after a very pleasant visit.    I did not underrate the grave responsibility that I incurred in  going against the policy of Government, but I"]]]
