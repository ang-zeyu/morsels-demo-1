It occurred to us that Turkey was  adopting a rather poor method of clipping the wings of these mountain  birds, by selling them the very best equipments for war. Legally, none but  government guards are permitted to carry arms, and yet both guns and  ammunition are sold in the bazaars of almost every city of the Turkish  dominions. The existence of these people, in their wild, semi-independent  state, shows not so much the power of the Kurds as the weakness of the  Turkish government, which desires to use a people of so fierce a  reputation for the suppression of its other subjects. After half an hour's  rest, we prepared to decamp, and so did our Kurdish companions. They were  soon in their saddles, and galloping away in front of us, with their arms  clanking, and glittering in the afternoon sunlight.    At the spring we had turned off the trail that led over the Sardarbulakh  pass into Russia, and were now following a horse-path which winds up to  the Kurdish encampments on the southern slope of the mountain. The plain  was strewn with sand and rocks, with here and there a bunch of tough, wiry  grass about a foot and a half high, which, though early in the year, was  partly dry. It would have been hot work except for the rain of the day  before and a strong southeast wind. As it was, our feet were blistered and  bruised, the thin leather sandals worn at the outset offering very poor  protection. The atmosphere being dry, though not excessively hot, we soon  began to suffer from thirst. Although we searched diligently for water, we  did not find it till after two hours more of constant marching, when at a  height of about 6000 feet, fifty yards from the path, we discerned a  picturesque cascade of sparkling, cold mountain water. Even the old  gentleman, Raffl, joined heartily in the gaiety induced by this clear,  cold water from Ararat's melting snows.      [Illustration: PARLEYING WITH THE KURDISH PARTY AT THE SPRING.]    Our ascent for two and a half hours longer was through a luxuriant  vegetation of flowers, grasses, and weeds, which grew more and more scanty  as we advanced. Prominent among the specimens were the wild pink, poppy,  and rose. One small fragrant herb, that was the most abundant of all, we  were told was used by the Kurds for making tea. All these filled the  evening air with perfume as we trudged along, passing now and then a  Kurdish lad, with his flock of sheep and goats feeding on the  mountain-grass, which was here much more luxuriant than below. Looking  backward, we saw that we were higher than the precipitous cliffs which  overtower the town of Bayazid, and which are perhaps from 1500 to 2000  feet above the lowest part of the plain. The view over the plateau was now  grand. Though we were all fatigued by the day's work, the cool,  moisture-laden air of evening revived our flagging spirits. We forged  ahead with nimble step, joking, and singing a variety of national airs.  The French \"Marseillaise,\" in which the old gentleman heartily joined,  echoed and reechoed among the rocks, and caused the shepherd lads and  their flocks to crane their heads in wonderment. Even the Armenian  muleteer so far overcame his fear of the Kurdish robbers as to indulge in  one of his accustomed funeral dirges; but it stopped short, never to go  again, when we came in sight of the Kurdish encampment. The poor fellow  instinctively grabbed his donkeys about their necks, as though they were  about to plunge over a precipice. The zaptiehs dashed ahead with the  mutessarif's letter to the Kurdish chief. We followed slowly on foot,  while the Armenian and his two pets kept at a respectful distance in the  rear.    The disk of the sun had already touched the western horizon when we came  to the black tents of the Kurdish encampment, which at this time of the  day presented a rather busy scene. The women seemed to be doing all the  work, while their lords sat round on their haunches. Some of the women  were engaged in milking the sheep and goats in an inclosure. Others were  busy making butter in a churn which was nothing more than a skin vessel  three feet long, of the shape of a Brazil-nut, suspended from a rude  tripod; this they swung to and fro to the tune of a weird Kurdish song.  Behind one of the tents, on a primitive weaving-machine, some of them were  making tent-roofing and matting. Others still were walking about with a  ball of wool in one hand and a distaff in the other, spinning yarn. The  flocks stood round about, bleating and lowing, or chewing their cud in  quiet contentment. All seemed very domestic and peaceful except the  Kurdish dogs, which set upon us with loud, fierce growls and gnashing  teeth.    Not so was it with the Kurdish chief, who by this time had finished  reading the mutessarif's message, and who now advanced from his tent with  salaams of welcome. As he stood before us in the glowing sunset, he was a  rather tall, but well-proportioned man, with black eyes and dark mustache,  contrasting well with his brown-tanned complexion. Upon his face was the  stamp of a rather wild and retiring character, although treachery and  deceit were by no means wanting. He wore a headgear that was something  between a hat and a turban, and over his baggy Turkish trousers hung a  long Persian coat of bright-colored, large-figured cloth, bound at the  waist by a belt of cartridges. Across the shoulders was slung a  breech-loading Martini rifle, and from his neck dangled a heavy gold  chain, which was probably the spoil of some predatory expedition. A quiet  dignity sat on Ismail Deverish's stalwart form.      [Illustration: THE KURDISH ENCAMPMENT.]    It was with no little pleasure that we accepted his invitation to a cup of  tea. After our walk of nineteen miles, in which we had ascended from 3000  to 7000 feet, we were in fit condition to appreciate a rest. That Kurdish  tent, as far as we were concerned, was a veritable palace, although we  were almost blinded by the smoke from the green pine-branches on the  smoldering fire. We said that the chief invited us to a cup of tea: so he  did--but we provided the tea; and that, too, not only for our own party,  but for half a dozen of the chief's personal friends. There being only two  glasses in the camp, we of course had to wait until our Kurdish  acquaintances had quenched their burning thirst. In thoughtful mood we  gazed around through the evening twilight. Far away on the western slope  we could see some Kurdish women plodding along under heavy burdens of  pine-branches like those that were now fumigating our eyes and nostrils.  Across the hills the Kurdish shepherds were driving home their herds and  flocks to the tinkling of bells. All this, to us, was deeply impressive.  Such peaceful scenes, we thought, could never be the haunt of warlike  robbers. The flocks at last came home; the shouts of the shepherds ceased;  darkness fell; and all was quiet.    One by one the lights in the tents broke out, like the stars above. As the  darkness deepened, they shone more and more brightly across the  amphitheater of the encampment. The tent in which we were now sitting was  oblong in shape, covered with a mixture of goats' and sheep's wool,  carded, spun, and woven by the Kurdish women. This tenting was all of a  dark brown or black color. The various strips were badly joined together,  allowing the snow and rain, during the stormy night that followed, to  penetrate plentifully. A wickerwork fencing, about three feet high, made  from the reeds gathered in the swamps of the Aras River, was stretched  around the bottom of the tent to keep out the cattle as well as to afford  some little protection from the elements. This same material, of the same  width or height, was used to partition off the apartments of the women.  Far from being veiled and shut up in harems, like their Turkish and  Persian sisters, the Kurdish women come and go among the men, and talk and  laugh as they please. The thinness and lowness of the partition walls did  not disturb their astonishing equanimity. In their relations with the men  the women are extremely free. During the evening we frequently found  ourselves surrounded by a concourse of these mountain beauties, who would  sit and stare at us with their black eyes, call attention to our personal  oddities, and laugh among themselves. Now and then their jokes at our  expense would produce hilarious laughter among the men. The dress of these  women consisted of baggy trousers, better described in this country as  \"divided skirts,\" a bright-colored overskirt and tunic, and a little round  cloth cap encircled with a band of red and black. Through the right lobe  of the nose was hung a peculiar button-shaped ornament studded with  precious stones. This picturesque costume well set off their rich olive  complexions, and black eyes beneath dark-brown lashes.    There were no signs of an approaching evening meal until we opened our  provision-bag, and handed over certain articles of raw food to be cooked  for us. No sooner were the viands intrusted to the care of our hosts, than  two sets of pots and kettles made their appearance in the other  compartments. In half an hour our host and friends proceeded to indulge  their voracious appetites. When our own meal was brought to us some time  after, we noticed that the fourteen eggs we had doled out had been reduced  to six; and the other materials suffered a similar reduction, the whole  thing being so patent as to make their attempt at innocence absurdly  ludicrous. We thought, however, if Kurdish highway robbery took no worse  form than this, we could well afford to be content. Supper over, we  squatted round a slow-burning fire, on the thick felt mats which served as  carpets, drank tea, and smoked the usual cigarettes. By the light of the  glowing embers we could watch the faces about us, and catch their  horrified glances when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#9)"],[1,"aem_, feed this appetite  for supernatural horrors. Among other incidents of that kind, says the  _Independance_, the following narrative was told to the company in the  _salon_ of an aristocratic Polish lady by the Comte de R----. He had  promised to tell a recent adventure with an inhabitant of the other  world, and when the clock struck midnight he began, while his auditors  gathered around him in breathless attention. His story we translate for  the _International_:--    At the beginning of last December, one of his friends, the Marquis de  N., came to see him. \"You know, Count,\" said the Marquis, \"what an  invincible repugnance I feel against returning to my chateau in  Normandy, where I had last summer the misfortune to lose my wife. But I  left there in a writing desk some important papers, which now happen to  be indispensable in a matter of family business. Here is the key; do me  the kindness to go and get the papers, for so delicate a mission I can  only intrust to you.\" M. de R. agreed to the request of his friend, and  set out the following day. He stopped at a station on the Rouen  railroad, whence a drive of two hours brought him to his friend's house.  He stopped before it, and a gardener came out and spoke with him through  the latticed iron gate, which he did not open. The Count was surprised  at this distrust, which even a card of admission from the proprietor of  the chateau did not overcome. Finally, after a brief absence, which  seemed to have been employed in seeking the advice of some one within,  the gardener came back and opened the gate. When the Count entered the  court-yard he saw that the blinds on the hundred windows of the chateau  were all closed, with one exception, where the blind had fallen off and  lay upon the ground. As he afterwards discovered, this window was  exactly in the middle of the chamber where his commission was to be  executed.    The Count's attention had been excited by his singular reception, and he  carefully observed every thing. He noticed a small stove-pipe leading  into a chimney. \"Is the house inhabited?\" he inquired. \"No,\" replied the  gardener, gruffly, as he opened a door upon a side stairway, which he  mounted before the Count, opening at each story the little apertures for  light in the queer old fashioned front of the chateau.    In the third story, the gardener stopped, and pointing to a door, said,  \"There.\" And without adding a word he turned about and went down stairs.  The Count opened the door and found himself in a dark ante-chamber. The  light from the stairway was sufficient, however, for him to distinguish  a second door, which he opened, and through which he went into the  apartment lighted from the window whence the blind had fallen. The  appearance of the room was cold, bare, and deserted. On the floor stood  a vacant bird-cage. The writing-desk indicated to the Count by his  friend, stood directly opposite the window. Without further delay, the  Count went directly up to the desk and opened it.    As he turned the key, the lock creaked very loudly, but at the same  moment he was aware of another and a different sound--that of a door  opening. The Count turns, and in the centre of an obscure side-room,  whose door was open, he sees a white figure, with its arms stretched  toward him.    \"Count!\" exclaims a low but most expressive voice, \"you come to rob me  of Theodore's letters? Why?\"    (Theodore is not the name of the proprietor of the chateau, at whose  request the Count had come.)    \"Madame!\" exclaims M. de R., \"who are you?\"    \"Do you not know me, much as I must be altered?\"    \"The Marchioness!\" exclaims the Count, astounded and even terrified.    \"Yes, it is me. We were friends once, and now you come to add terribly  to my sufferings! Who sends you? My husband? What does he yet desire? In  mercy leave me the letters!\"    While she said this, the figure made signs to the Count to come nearer.  He obeyed, forcing from his mind every suggestion that the apparition  was supernatural, and finally convinced that the Marchioness stood  before him living, under some strange mystery. He followed her into the  second room.    She was dressed in a robe, or more properly, a shroud of a gray color.  Her beautiful hair, which had for years been the envy of all other  women, fell in disorder upon her shoulders. The vague light, which came  in from the adjoining room, was just enough for the Count to remark the  extraordinary thinness and deathly pallor of the Marchioness.    Hardly had he come near her, when she said to him, quickly, almost with  vehemence:    \"I suffer from incredible pains in my head. The cause is in my  hair,--for eight months it has not been combed. Count, do me this  service--comb it!\"    After she had sat down, she reached a comb to M. de R., who  involuntarily obeyed her. She did not speak again, and he did not dare  to. As he confesses, he was greatly agitated. Without doubt he performed  his office of waiting-maid badly, for from time to time the lady uttered  a slight murmur of complaint.    Suddenly she rose, said \"Merci!\" and vanished in the gloom at the end of  the chamber. The Count waited a few moments, vainly stretching his  senses, but saw and heard nothing more. Then he resolved to return into  the first room. When his eyes fell upon the writing-desk, he perceived  that its contents were in the greatest confusion. However, he found the  family papers that he had been sent for. After he had closed the desk  again he waited a few moments; he called, but there was no answer.  Finally he went down stairs, and as he said himself, with steps that did  not linger.    There was no one in the court-yard. Before the iron gate was the  coachman ready to start. M. de R. saw no reason for tarrying longer. On  the returning way, as he was seeking to collect his thoughts upon the  strange event in the chateau, he perceived that his clothes were covered  with the Marchioness's hair.    He stopped at Rouen, and two days after returned to Paris. It was the  third of December. He sought for the Marquis, but could not find him. It  is now thought he must have fallen in the firing on the Boulevard  Montmartre, where his club is situated.    Such is the narrative which M. de R. had promised to tell in the _salon_  of the old Polish lady, where he was waited for till midnight. He came  just as the company were about separating, and showed the hairs of the  Marchioness. One of them lies on the table before me.          EDWARD EVERETT AND DANIEL WEBSTER.      The some time expected new edition of _The Speeches, Forensic Arguments,  and Diplomatic Papers_ of DANIEL WEBSTER, has just appeared, in six  large and beautifully printed volumes, from the press of Little & Brown,  of Boston. The editorial supervision of the work was undertaken by  EDWARD EVERETT, who has prefixed to the first volume a brief memoir of  the illustrious statesman, orator, and author, from the beginning and  the end of which we copy a few important paragraphs. Respecting the past  and present collections of these great compositions, Mr. Everett says:         \"The first collection of Mr. Webster's speeches in the Congress       of the United States and on various public occasions, was       published in Boston in one volume octavo, in 1830. This volume       was more than once reprinted, and in 1835 a second volume was       published, containing the speeches made up to that time, and       not included in the first collection. Several impressions of       these two volumes were called for by the public. In 1843 a       third volume was prepared, containing a selection from the       speeches of Mr. Webster from the year 1835 till his entrance       into the cabinet of General Harrison. In the year 1848 appeared       a fourth volume of diplomatic papers, containing a portion of       Mr. Webster's official correspondence as Secretary of State.       The great favor with which these volumes' have been received       throughout the country, and the importance of the subjects       discussed in the Senate of the United States after Mr.       Webster's return to that body in 1845, have led his friends to       think that a valuable service would be rendered to the       community by bringing together his speeches of a later date       than those contained in the third volume of the former       collection, and on political subjects arising since that time.       Few periods of our history will be entitled to be remembered by       events of greater moment, such as the admission of Texas to the       Union, the settlement of the Oregon controversy, the Mexican       war, the acquisition of California and other Mexican provinces,       and the exciting questions which have grown out of the sudden       extension of the territory of the United States. Rarely have       public discussions been carried on with greater earnestness,       with more important consequences visibly at stake, or with       greater ability. The speeches made by Mr. Webster in the       Senate, and on public occasions of various kinds, during the       progress of these controversies, are more than sufficient to       fill two new volumes. The opportunity of their collection has       been taken by the enterprising publishers, in compliance with       opinions often expressed by the most respectable individuals,       and with a manifest public demand, to bring out a new edition       of Mr. Webster's speeches in uniform style. Such is the object       of the present publication. The first two volumes contain the       speeches delivered by him on a great variety of public       occasions, commencing with his discourse at Plymouth in       December, 1820. Three succeeding volumes embrace the greater       part of the speeches delivered in the Massachusetts Convention       and in the two houses of Congress, beginning with the speech on       the Bank of the United States in 1816.
