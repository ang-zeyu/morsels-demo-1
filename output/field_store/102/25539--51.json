This medicated milk should be fed to the calf in the usual  quantity. When the diarrhea is not controlled in three or four days by this  treatment, the additional use of some of the agents recommended above may  assist in a recovery.      INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; WHITE SCOUR.    [See chapter on Diseases of young calves, p. 247.]      GASTROENTERITIS.    This consists of an inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and of the  bowel.    Gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and  intestines, follows upon irritations more severe or longer continued than  those that produce gastrointestinal catarrh.    _Causes._--Severe indigestion may be followed by gastroenteritis, or it may  be caused by swallowing irritant poisons, such as arsenic or corrosive  sublimate or irritant plants. Exposure to cold or inclement weather may  produce the disease, especially in debilitated animals or animals fed  improperly. It is asserted that if cattle feed on vegetation infested with  some kinds of caterpillars this disease may result.    _Symptoms._--Dullness; drooping of the ears; dryness of the muzzle; dry  skin; staring coat; loins morbidly sensitive to pressure; fullness of the  left flank, which is caused by the distention of the fourth stomach by gas.  The pulse is small, the gait is feeble and staggering; each step taken is  accompanied with a grunt, and this symptom is especially marked if the  animal walks in a downward direction. There is loss of appetite, and  rumination is suspended. The passages at first are few in number, hard, and  are sometimes coated with mucus or with blood. Later a severe diarrhea sets  in, when the passages contain mucus and blood and have an offensive odor.  There is evidence of colicky pain, and the abdomen is sensitive to  pressure. Pain may be continuous. There is fever and acceleration of pulse  rate and respirations. Mental depression and even insensibility occur  before death. The disease is always severe and often fatal.    _Post-mortem appearances._--The mucous membrane of the fourth stomach has a  well-marked red color and sometimes presents ulcerations. The wall is  thickened and softened, and similar conditions are found in the walls of  the intestines. The red discoloration extends in spots or large areas quite  through the wall, showing on the outside.    _Treatment._--Very small quantities of carefully selected feed must be  given and the appetite must not be forced. Protect the animal well from  cold and dampness. Internally, give linseed tea, boiled milk, boiled  oatmeal gruel, or rice water. These protectives may carry the medicine.  Tannopin in doses of 30 to 60 grains is good. Subnitrate of bismuth in  doses of 1 to 2 drams may be given. Pulverized opium may be used, if the  diarrhea is severe, in 1 to 2 dram doses. If the bowel movements are not  free, one may give from a pint to a quart of castor or raw linseed oil.      TRAUMATIC INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.    This disease results from the presence of a foreign body. This condition is  not rare in cattle, because these animals have the habit of swallowing  their feed without careful chewing, and so nails, screws, hairpins, ends of  wire, and other metal objects may be swallowed unconsciously. Such objects  gravitate to the second stomach, where they may be caught in the folds of  the lining mucous membrane, and in some instances the wall of this organ is  perforated. From this accident, chronic indigestion results. The symptoms,  more or less characteristic, are pain when getting up or lying down;  grunting and pain upon sudden motion, especially downhill; coughing; pain  on pressure over the second stomach, which lies immediately above the  cartilaginous prolongation of the sternum. If the presence of such a  foreign body is recognized, it may be removed by a difficult surgical  operation, or, as is usually most economical, the animal may be killed for  beef, if there is no fever.      DISEASES OF THE BOWELS.    DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY.    [See also Gastrointestinal catarrh, p. 32.]    The word \"dysentery,\" as it is commonly used in relation to the diseases of  animals, signifies a severe form of diarrhea.    _Causes._--Diarrhea is a symptom of irritation of the intestines, resulting  in increased secretion or increased muscular contractions, or both. The  irritation is sometimes the result of chilling from exposure, improper  feeding, irritant feeds, indigestion, organic diseases of the intestines,  or parasites.    _Symptoms._--Passages from the bowels are frequent, at first consisting of  thin dung, but as the disease continues they become watery and offensive  smelling, and may be even streaked with blood. At first the animal shows no  constitutional disturbance, but later it becomes weak and may exhibit  evidence of abdominal pain by looking around to the side, drawing the feet  together, lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this malady is  accompanied with fever, great depression, loss of strength, rapid loss of  flesh, and it may terminate in death.    _Treatment._--When the disease depends on irritating properties of the feed  which has been supplied to the animal, it is advisable to give a mild  purgative, such as a pint of castor or linseed oil. When the secretions of  the bowels are irritating, an ounce of carbonate of magnesia and half an  ounce of tincture of opium should be shaken up in a quart of linseed tea  and given to the animal three times a day until the passages present a  natural appearance. When there is debility, want of appetite, no fever, but  a continuance of the watery discharges from the bowels, then an astringent  may be given. For such cases the following is serviceable: Tannic acid, 1  ounce; powdered gentian, 2 ounces; mix and divide into 12 powders, one  powder to be given three times a day until the passages present a natural  appearance. Each powder may be mixed with a pint and a half of water.  Tannopin is a new remedy that is most useful in such cases. The dose is  from 30 grains to 2 drams. Useful household remedies are raw eggs, strong  coffee, parched rye flour, or decoction of oak bark. In all cases the food  must be given sparingly, and it should be carefully selected to insure good  quality. Complete rest in a box stall is desirable. When diarrhea is a  symptom of a malady characterized by the presence of a blood poison, the  treatment appropriate to such disease must be applied.      SIMPLE ENTERITIS.    [See Gastroenteritis, p. 33.]      CROUPOUS ENTERITIS.    Under certain conditions, severe irritation of the digestive canal may, in  cattle, cause a form of inflammation of the intestines (enteritis) that is  characterized by the formation of a false membrane upon the surface of the  lining membrane of the intestines, particularly the large ones.    _Symptoms._--There is fever, depression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and in  the fecal masses shreds of leathery false membrane may be found. These  shreds are sometimes mistaken for parasites or for portions of the wall of  the intestine.    _Treatment._--Give a pound of Glauber's salt, followed by bicarbonate of  soda in doses of 2 ounces four times daily.    ENTERITIS (OBSTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INVAGINATION, OR INTUSSUSCEPTION,  TWISTING, AND KNOTTING OF THE BOWELS).    Inflammation may arise from a knot forming on some part of the small  intestine from the portion of the bowel becoming twisted on itself, or from  one part of the bowel slipping into another, which is termed invagination.  This form of enteritis occurs occasionally in animals of the bovine  species.    _Causes._--The small intestine, which in the ox rests on the right side of  the rumen, is, from the position which it occupies, predisposed to this  accident. It has been ascertained that animals which have shown symptoms of  this malady have trotted, galloped, or made other violent exertions in  coming from drinking, or that they have been chased by dogs or by animals  of their own species while at pasture. The accident is most likely to occur  among cattle on very hilly pastures. The danger of jumping or running is  greatest when the rumen is distended with food.    _Symptoms._--This form of enteritis or obstruction is manifested by severe  colicky pains; the ox scrapes and strikes the ground with his front and  hind feet alternately; keeps lying down and getting up again; he keeps his  tail constantly raised and turns his nose frequently to his right flank; he  is frequently bloated, or tympanitic, on that side. He refuses feed and  does not ruminate, and for some hours suffers severe pains. At first he  frequently passes thin dung, and also urinates frequently, but passes only  a little urine at a time. On the second day the pains have become less  acute; the animal remains lying down; moans occasionally; his pulse is  small and quick; he still refuses feed and does not ruminate. At this stage  he does not pass any dung, though sometimes a small quantity of bloody  mucus may be passed. The animal passes very little urine. This condition  may continue for a considerable time, as cattle so affected may live for 15  or even 20 days.    _Post-mortem appearance._--At death the bowels are found to be misplaced or  obstructed, as mentioned above, and inflamed, the inflammation always  originating at the point where the intestine has been invaginated, twisted,  or knotted. Sometimes the part is gangrenous, the compression of the blood  vessels preventing circulation, and thus causing the death of the tissues.    _Treatment._--Purgatives, anodynes,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#9)"],[1,"and then, having declined reelection,  returned to Congress in 1783. There, among his other accomplishments,  as chairman of the committee, he reported the Treaty of Peace and, as  chairman of another committee, devised and persuaded Congress to adopt a  national system of coinage which in its essentials is still in use.    It is easy to criticize Jefferson and to pick flaws in the things that  he said as well as in the things that he did, but practically every  one admits that he was closely in touch with the course of events  and understood the temper of his contemporaries. In this period of  transition from the old order to the new, he seems to have expressed the  genius of American institutions better than almost any other man of his  generation. He possessed a quality that enabled him, in the Declaration  of Independence, to give voice to the hopes and aspirations of a rising  nationality and that enabled him in his own State to bring about so many  reforms.    Just how much actual influence Thomas Jefferson had in the framing  of the American land policy is not clear. Although the draft of the  committee report in 1784 is in Jefferson's handwriting, it is altogether  probable that more credit is to be given to Thomas Hutchins, the  Geographer of the United States, and to William Grayson of Virginia,  especially for the final form which the measure took; for Jefferson  retired from the chairmanship and had already gone to Europe when the  Land Ordinance was adopted by Congress in 1785. This ordinance has been  superseded by later enactments, to which references are usually made;  but the original ordinance is one of the great pieces of American  legislation, for it contained the fundamentals of the American land  system which, with the modifications experience has introduced, has  proved to be permanently workable and which has been envied and in  several instances copied by other countries. Like almost all successful  institutions of that sort, the Land Ordinance of 1785 was not an  immediate creation but was a development out of former practices and  customs and was in the nature of a compromise. Its essential features  were the method of survey and the process for the sale of land. New  England, with its town system, had in the course of its expansion been  accustomed to proceed in an orderly method but on a relatively small  scale. The South, on the other hand, had granted lands on a larger scale  and had permitted individual selection in a haphazard manner. The plan  which Congress adopted was that of the New England survey with the  Southern method of extensive holdings. The system is repellent in its  rectangular orderliness, but it made the process of recording titles  easy and complete, and it was capable of indefinite expansion. These  were matters of cardinal importance, for in the course of one hundred  and forty years the United States was to have under its control nearly  two thousand million acres of land.    The primary feature of the land policy was the orderly survey in advance  of sale. In the next place the township was taken as the unit, and its  size was fixed at six miles square. Provision was then made for the sale  of townships alternately entire and by sections of one mile square, or  640 acres each. In every township a section was reserved for educational  purposes; that is, the land was to be disposed of and the proceeds used  for the development of public schools in that region. And, finally, the  United States reserved four sections in the center of each township to  be disposed of at a later time. It was expected that a great increase  in the value of the land would result, and it was proposed that the  Government should reap a part of the profits.    It is evident that the primary purpose of the public land policy as  first developed was to acquire revenue for the Government; but it  was also evident that there was a distinct purpose of encouraging  settlement. The two were not incompatible, but the greater interest of  the Government was in obtaining a return for the property.    The other committee of which Jefferson was chairman made its report of a  plan for the government of the western territory upon the very day that  the Virginia cession was finally accepted, March 1, 1784; and with some  important modifications Jefferson's ordinance, or the Ordinance of  1784 as it was commonly called, was ultimately adopted. In this case  Jefferson rendered a service similar to that of framing the Declaration  of Independence. His plan was somewhat theoretical and visionary,  but largely practical, and it was constructive work of a high order,  displaying not so much originality as sympathetic appreciation of what  had already been done and an instinctive forecast of future development.  Jefferson seemed to be able to gather up ideas, some conscious and some  latent in men's minds, and to express them in a form that was generally  acceptable.    It is interesting to find in the Articles of Confederation (Article  XI) that, \"Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the  measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to  all the advantages of this Union: but no other colony shall be admitted  into the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\" The  real importance of this article lay in the suggestion of an enlargement  of the Confederation. The Confederation was never intended to be a union  of only thirteen States. Before the cession of their western claims it  seemed to be inevitable that some of the States should be broken up into  several units. At the very time that the formation of the Confederation  was under discussion Vermont issued a declaration of independence from  New York and New Hampshire, with the expectation of being admitted into  the Union. It was impolitic to recognize the appeal at that time, but  it seems to have been generally understood that sooner or later Vermont  would come in as a full-fledged State.    It might have been a revolutionary suggestion by Maryland, when the  cession of western lands was under discussion, that Congress should have  sole power to fix the western boundaries of the States, but her further  proposal was not even regarded as radical, that Congress should \"lay  out the land beyond the boundaries so ascertained into separate and  independent states.\" It seems to have been taken as a matter of course  in the procedure of Congress and was accepted by the States. But the  idea was one thing; its carrying out was quite another. Here was a great  extent of western territory which would be valuable only as it could  be sold to prospective settlers. One of the first things these settlers  would demand was protection--protection against the Indians, possibly  also against the British and the Spanish, and protection in their  ordinary civil life. The former was a detail of military organization  and was in due time provided by the establishment of military forts and  garrisons; the latter was the problem which Jefferson's committee was  attempting to solve.    The Ordinance of 1784 disregarded the natural physical features of the  western country and, by degrees of latitude and meridians of longitude,  arbitrarily divided the public domain into rectangular districts, to the  first of which the following names were applied: Sylvania, Michigania,  Cherronesus, Assenisipia, Metropotamia, Illinoia, Saratoga, Washington,  Polypotamia, Pelisipia. The amusement which this absurd and thoroughly  Jeffersonian nomenclature is bound to cause ought not to detract from  the really important features of the Ordinance. In each of the districts  into which the country was divided the settlers might be authorized by  Congress, for the purpose of establishing a temporary government, to  adopt the constitution and laws of any one of the original States. When  any such area should have twenty thousand free inhabitants it might  receive authority from Congress to establish a permanent constitution  and government and should be entitled to a representative in Congress  with the right of debating but not of voting. And finally, when the  inhabitants of any one of these districts should equal in number those  of the least populous of the thirteen original States, their delegates  should be admitted into Congress on an equal footing.    Jefferson's ordinance, though adopted, was never put into operation.  Various explanations have been offered for this failure to give it a  fair trial. It has been said that Jefferson himself was to blame. In the  original draft of his ordinance Jefferson had provided for the abolition  of slavery in the new States after the year 1800, and when  Congress refused to accept this clause Jefferson, in a manner quite  characteristic, seemed to lose all interest in the plan. There were,  however, other objections, for there were those who felt that it was  somewhat indefinite to promise admission into the Confederation of  certain sections of the country as soon as their population should equal  in number that of the least populous of the original States. If the  original States should increase in population to any extent, the new  States might never be admitted. But on the other hand, if from any cause  the population of one of the smaller States should suddenly decrease,  might not the resulting influx of new States prove dangerous?    But the real reason why the ordinance remained a dead letter was that,  while it fixed the limits within which local governments might act,  it left the creation of those governments wholly to the future. At  Vincennes, for example, the ordinance made no change in the political  habits of the people. \"The local government bowled along merrily under  this system. There was the greatest abundance of government, for the  more the United States neglected them the more authority their officials  assumed.\"* Nor could the ordinance operate until settlers became  "]]]
