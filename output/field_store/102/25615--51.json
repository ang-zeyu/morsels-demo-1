For this  we can easily account, when we recollect that the materials of the work  were taken from a series of popular sermons of the author, delivered at  intervals. The editor allows himself to hope that the Index which he has  prepared, may occasionally be of service to the reader.    § 39. But even after having made numerous changes on _every page_ of the  old translation before him, the American editor is conscious that a  critical eye will discover many imperfections in the style. It is often  antiquated and heavy, and sometimes even quaint. Nevertheless, in all  these instances he allowed the English text to remain as he found it,  contenting himself with the correction of orthographical and syntactical  inaccuracies, the rectification of Scripture references, the errors in  which he found to be unusually numerous, the correction of quotations in  accordance with the authorized English version of the Bible, in the many  cases in which Mr. Boehm, or one of his assistants, translated from  Luther's German version, or quoted the English version from memory, etc.,  etc.    § 40. It is eminently proper that a new edition of Arndt's \"True  Christianity\" should appear during the present Jubilee year of the  Evangelical Lutheran Church, and that it should be undertaken and  conducted to a successful issue by members of the Evangelical Lutheran  Synod of Pennsylvania. The deep spirituality of Arndt, and his active and  pure faith, can be fully understood and appreciated only when we reflect  on the doctrinal system to which he had given his heart, and to which we  have referred above. This orthodox system found no favor, at a later  period, among the Rationalists; they rejected the doctrines of the Bible  respecting the depravity of human nature, the divinity of Christ, the  efficacy of the divinely appointed means of grace, and similar truths, and  grievously complained of the violence which, as they treacherously  alleged, was offered to their conscience, when the demand was made, that  if they claimed to belong to the Lutheran Church, to occupy its pulpits,  and to receive their support from it, they ought also to adopt its faith.  Their influence is happily decaying in Europe, and the restoration of the  doctrines of the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church to  authority, is coincident with the new and healthy religious life of the  Lutheran Church in Germany, Hungary, Scandinavia, and Russia. The sincere  Christian, John Arndt, whom we heard protesting before God, with his last  breath, as described above, that he believed only the doctrines of the  Symbolical Books of the Lutheran Church, and _all_ those doctrines, little  thought that more than two centuries afterwards, in the remote Western  continent of America, men would arise who would not only reject with scorn  \"all the other Symbolical Books,\" which he revered, but also speak  contemptuously of the Augsburg Confession and its holy doctrines.    § 41. The doctrinal system which Arndt so sincerely revered, was brought  to this country by the Lutheran pastors who visited our shores at a very  early period. Dr. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, an eminently enlightened and  holy man, was enabled, by his well-disciplined mind and great  administrative powers, to create order among the scattered Lutherans whom  he found in this country. He was exceedingly zealous in maintaining the  purity of the Lutheran faith, to which he owed all his peace and his  hopes. He gave unusual prominence to the Symbolical Books--to _all_ of  them, mentioned by name--in the various constitutions of congregations  organized or influenced by him, and very properly claimed that none who  rejected them could honestly bear the name of _Lutherans_. We will give  only one illustration, of many which might be adduced, to show the  fidelity with which he held to the Lutheran Symbolical Books, as  enumerated by Arndt in the last paragraph of his Preface to Book I., in  this volume. Dr. Muhlenberg states in an official Report for the year  1747, which he transmitted to Halle (_Hall. Nachr._, pp. 234, 235), that  he had visited a congregation in Maryland, in which great dissensions  prevailed at the time, occasioned by efforts made by certain individuals  to alienate the Lutherans from their faith and church. He says, \"Before we  commenced public worship, I asked for the Church Record, and wrote certain  propositions and articles in it in the English language, and among other  statements, made the following: That our German Lutherans held to the holy  Word of God, in the prophetic and apostolical writings; further, to the  unaltered Augsburg Confession, and the other Symbolical Books, etc.(3) I  then read the same publicly to the congregation, and explained it to them  in the German language, and added, that every one who desired to be, and  to remain, _such_ a Lutheran, should subscribe his name.\" He informs us  that the genuine Lutherans readily subscribed; the rest, who had  unlutheran sympathies, withheld their names.    § 42. An unhappy change occurred after Dr. Muhlenberg's day. The  Symbolical Books, which he and his contemporaries received, believed, and  sustained in their whole extent, with religious veneration, existed at  that time only in Latin and German. They gradually receded from the view  of many pastors of the church; individuals were received into the ranks of  the ministry, who had never studied them; doctrines and usages, hitherto  unknown to the church, were introduced into many Lutheran congregations.  At one period several of the most intelligent pastors yielded, to a  certain extent, to rationalistic influences; then, the opposite extreme,  of fanaticism, gained adherents; both rationalism and fanaticism were  alike hostile to \"the unaltered Augsburg Confession and the other  Symbolical Books,\" and a strange combination of elements, derived partly  from rationalism, and partly from fanaticism, temporarily held sway.  Dependence was now placed on human measures and inventions, designed for  the conversion of sinners and the edification of believers, rather than on  the divinely appointed means of grace, which men like Arndt and Muhlenberg  recognized as the only channels through which the Divine Spirit exercises  his influence. If they had lived among us during the second, third, and  fourth decades of this century, when their doctrines, and their mode of  preaching, were regarded by many as antiquated, or unsuited to a supposed  higher grade of religious development, they would have readily predicted  the results--fanaticism, latitudinarianism in doctrine, an evanescent  emotional religion, and, by consequence, the rejection, in whole or in  part, of the Augsburg Confession and the other Symbolical Books.    § 43. God, in his mercy, has interposed. The doctrines which Arndt,  Muhlenberg, and men of the old faith, regarded as the life-blood of a  healthy, scriptural religion, are regaining their authority. Many still  reject them; the old faith of the church--Bible truth, is unwelcome to an  ignorant, rationalistic, and unconverted heart. But others have been  taught by observation and experience that mere human measures and  inventions cannot conduct to a healthy and permanent religion, and that  divine truth, as taught in the Scriptures, and set forth in our Symbolical  Books, and the other means of grace given to the Church by its divine  Head, are the only sources from which such a healthy religion can proceed.  In this spirit Arndt wrote the \"True Christianity,\" and by this spirit the  Synod of Pennsylvania is animated. This ecclesiastical body desires to  take away all glory from man, and to give it all to Christ. One of the  results of its attachment to our ancient and holy faith, is the  publication of the present volume, in which the author so eloquently and  affectionately urges all men to repent, to believe in Christ, and to lead  a holy life.    § 44. The divine blessing has so remarkably attended the use of Arndt's  \"True Christianity,\" in the original language, and in its various  translations, that the present editor humbly entertains the hope that the  time and labor expended by him in preparing this new edition, may also be  of avail. And he prays that the \"True Christianity\" may continue the work  which it has already performed, and instruct, guide, and comfort anew the  souls of its readers, to the praise and glory of God.    C. F. S.    PHILADELPHIA, August, 1868.            BOOK I.      Wherein True Christianity, Sincere Sorrow For Sin, Repentance, Faith, And             The Holy Life Of The True Christian, Are Considered.          The Author's Preface To The First Book.      Christian Reader! That the holy Gospel is subjected, in our age, to a  great and shameful abuse, is fully proved by the ungodly and impenitent  life of those who loudly boast of Christ and of his word, while their  unchristian life resembles that of persons who dwell in a land of heathens  and not of Christians. Such an ungodly course of conduct furnished me with  an occasion for writing this Treatise; it was my object to show to plain  readers wherein true Christianity consists, namely, in the exhibition of a  true, living, and active faith, which manifests itself in genuine  godliness and the fruits of righteousness. I desired to show that we bear  the name of _Christians_, not only because we ought to believe in Christ,  but also because the name implies that we live in Christ, and that He  lives in us. I further desired to show that true repentance proceeds from  the inmost centre of the heart; that the heart, mind, and affections must  be changed; that we must be conformed to Christ and His holy Gospel; and  that we must be renewed by the word of God, and become new creatures. For  even as every seed produces fruit of a like nature, so the word of God  must daily produce in us new spiritual fruits. If we become new creatures  by faith, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#9)"],[1,"Albatross=, _D. regia_, A., T., N.Z.

There are four chief  kinds of these--Terns (Sea-Swallows), including Noddy Terns, Gulls,  the remarkable northern Skimmers, which skim along the surface with  the lengthened end of the lower mandible in the water, and the bold  sea-pirates, Skuas. Fifty-seven Terns and Noddies are found throughout  the world. Of these, twenty-one have been recorded from Australian  waters.    Being powerful flyers, it is not surprising to find that several of  the Australian Terns are really Old-World, and even New-World, forms  too. Thus the Whiskered (Marsh) Tern is also British. The Caspian,  Gull-billed, and Bridled (Brown-winged) Terns are British and  American, while the Sooty Tern is found in all tropical and  sub-tropical seas. It is one of the famous birds of the world, for  it is the \"egg bird\" of sailors. It retires in large companies to  low scrubby islands to breed. Here it lays a single egg on the bare  ground. Sailors, tired of ship's fare, often visit these \"rookeries.\"  Gould quotes a record of one party which took 1500 dozen eggs on  one small island in Torres Strait. Spanish eggers from Havanah take  cargoes, which are disposed of at 25 cents per gallon.    The Wide-Awake Fair, of Ascension Island, is a famous annual event  in natural history. A similar scene has been described by Mr. A. W.  Milligan, the well-known West Australian ornithologist, on the Houtman  Abrolhos Island, west of Western Australia. Here acres of the ground  were covered by birds sitting on their nests. The question is, does  each find its own nest when it returns to sit? Mr. Milligan settled  this in the affirmative by tying a piece of string to a sitting bird  and then letting it take flight. It found its own egg, and resumed its  work. It is noteworthy that no two of the million eggs are similarly  marked, and this puzzling variation in marking probably assists each  bird to recognize its own egg.    One of the daintiest of these birds is the Fairy Tern, which was  common on Mud Island while the 1909 Summer School was being held.  Obedient to the call of the mother bird, which hovered threateningly  overhead, the mottled and striped young one squatted on the shelly  sand beach while bird-lovers hunted around for the material for a  photograph. At length the dark eye revealed the beautifully-protected  young bird.    As the camera was being fixed, a different call from the mother caused  the young one to run away. Three or four naturalists tried to catch  the active little bird, which stopped for a moment and disgorged two  whole small fish, with which its mother had evidently but recently fed  it. Eventually a good picture was obtained. These Terns nest singly,  though others nest in large companies. They obtain fish by diving into  the sea. It was interesting, on a Nature-study excursion, to watch the  Crested Terns diving frequently into the sea above a shoal of small  fish at Sandringham.    We found the Noddies breeding in thousands on Mast Head Island, in the  Capricorn Group. They built a small platform of leaves, or seaweed,  high or low, on every possible nesting site on the great _Pisonia_  trees. In fact, there is an interesting kind of partnership between  the bird and the tree. The fruits of the _Pisonia_ have bands of  sticky glands, which adhere to the plumage of the birds. After a  time the fruits fall off, possibly on another island, and so this  interesting tree is spread throughout these small coral sandbanks  and islets. The birds are sometimes so loaded and clogged with these  fruits that they are incapable of flight. Surely here is a wonderful  partnership between the tree-frequenting Noddy and the forest tree  that provides shelter and nesting places for it. It is, indeed, a  marvellous method of seed dispersal.    The number of ocean birds breeding on these tiny island-paradises  is amazing. Minute Mast Head Island is a place free of all pests--no  flies, no mosquitoes, no ticks, no snakes, nor prickly plants, but  a deep shady forest of giant _Pisonia_ trees, sometimes covered with  creepers and lianas, and fringed with pretty flowering shrubs, fig  trees, and long green grass, and surrounded, above spring-tide level,  by a fringe of graceful Horse-tail Sheoaks (Casuarinas). We calculated  that over 100,000 birds bred annually on this 100-acre sandbank, no  point of which rose 10 feet above spring-tide level. The graceful  White-capped Noddies already mentioned nested high and low on the  trees and shrubs. Petrels in thousands burrowed in the sand under the  giant _Pisonias_, which are so thickly foliaged that not enough  light penetrates to enable undergrowth to flourish, so the sand was  practically bare in the centre of the island. Reef Herons nested  low on spreading branches or interlacing roots. Silver Gulls and  Oyster-catchers nested on the ground, within about a yard of the  spring-tide mark; Doves, Silver-eyes, Bell-Magpies (_Streperas_),  Caterpillar-eaters, Kingfishers, and other land birds nested in the  trees, while the White-bellied Sea-Eagle (almost a fac-simile of the  Bald Eagle of America) had his nest overlooking all, on the highest  tree on the island. The Frigate Birds were not nesting on Mast Head  Island, but they roosted each night in the tall Sheoaks at the water's  edge. It was a treat, in the late afternoon, to see these glorious  birds winding up their invisible staircase into the vast void of upper  air. Gloriously and calmly they sailed up and up, until the merest  speck only could be seen. Of corals, turtles, and other marvels we may  not speak here. The migrating wading-birds had just reached the island  after their long journey from Siberian Tundras. Some were so poor  that we caught Sandpipers by hand. Flocks of Turnstone, Golden Plover,  Godwits, Curlew, and other wading-birds were there, possibly only  resting before continuing their journey to the South. It was indeed  a privilege to live on such a spot for nine days and to see Nature in  some of her most interesting phases.    The two Australian Seagulls illustrate the \"law of representatives\" so  often referred to by Gould. It is strange how often a closely similar  representative of a Northern bird is found in Australia. Thus the big  Pacific Gull is the representative of the large Gull of Europe, though  its peculiar deepened and orange-colored bill is distinctive. It does  not gain its beautiful white and black plumage until it is three or  more years old, being brown in the first year, and brown and white in  the second year.    The Silver Gull is known to all. Though a dainty-looking bird, it has  a bad character. It is worse than any bird of prey for stealing eggs  and young birds, for let a gannet or other nesting bird but leave the  nest for a moment, and Gulls quickly rob it of its contents. They are  scavengers, and eagerly follow a steamer at lunch-time to gather the  scraps. An interesting sight of Currie Harbor, King Island, is to see  the large company of Seagulls nesting undisturbed on a tiny, bare,  rocky islet close to the pier.    It was noted that, whenever the Noddies were disturbed, and rose,  protesting loudly, the Gulls immediately gathered and hovered over  the trees containing Noddies' nests. Evidently they were looking for  unprotected eggs.    Placed in the next family are the seven robber Gulls or sea  pirates--Skuas. We read of these birds in the old _Royal Readers_,  but few recognized them when they followed us to the Summer School  of 1910. They also followed our afternoon-tea cruise to South Channel  fort, and played their usual game of compelling the Seagulls to give  up the scraps they had gathered. The Robber Gull, or Skua, of Victoria  is, strange to say, identical with the Skua of England. The one that  followed the s.s. _Lady Loch_ to the Summer School is better known in  England as the Arctic Gull or Richardson Skua. It breeds in the far  North, so it is a great traveller."]]]
