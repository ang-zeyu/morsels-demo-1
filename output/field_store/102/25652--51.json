We who were left at Fort Denonville had but few mattocks or  even axes. Of ammunition there was none too much. In the Senecas'  country we had destroyed thousands of minots[6] of corn, but had brought  along scarce a week's rations of it to this corner. We had none of us  gone a-soldiering with our pockets full of seed, and even if we had  brought ample store of corn and pumpkin seed, of lentils and salad  plants, the season was too late to have done much in gardening. We made  some feeble attempts at it; but no rain fell, the earth baked under the  sun so hard that great cracks came in it; and what few shoots of corn  and pumpkin thrust upward through this parched soil, withered away  before any strengthening juices came in them. To hunt far from the fort  we durst not, save in considerable parties; so that if we made ourselves  safe from the savages, we also made every other living thing safe  against us. To fish was well nigh our only recourse; but although many  of our men labored diligently at it, they met with but indifferent  return.    Thus it was that our most ardent hopes, our very life itself, hung upon  the coming of the promised supplies. There was joy at the fort when at  length the sail of the little bark was seen; even De Troyes, who had  grown exceeding grave and melancholy, took on again something of his  wonted spirit. But we were not quite yet to be succored, for it was the  season of the most light and trifling airs, so that the bark for two  days hung idly on the shining lake, some leagues away from the mouth of  the river, while we idled and fretted like children, impatient for her  coming. When once we had her within the bar, there was no time lost in  unlading. It was a poor soldier indeed who could not work to secure the  comfort of his own belly; and the store was so ample that we felt secure  for the winter, come what might. The bark that fetched these things had  been so delayed by the calms, that she weighed and sailed with the first  favoring breeze; and it was not until her sail had fall'n below the  horizon that we fairly had sight or smell of what she had brought.    From the first the stores proved bad; still, we made shift to use the  best, eked out with what the near-by forest and river afforded. For many  weeks we saw no foes. There was little work to do, and the men idled  through the days, with no word on their lips but to complain of the food  and wish for spring. When the frosts began to fall we had a more  vigorous spell of it; but now for the first time appeared the Iroquois  wasps. One of our parties, which had gone toward the great fall of the  Niagara, lost two men; those who returned reported that their comrades  were taken all unawares by the savages. Another party, seeking game to  the eastward where a stream cuts through the high bank on its way to the  lake,[7] never came back at all. Here we found their bodies and buried  them; but their scalps, after the manner of these people, had been  taken.    Christmas drew on, but never was a sorrier season kept by soldiers of  France. De Troyes had fallen ill. Naught ailed him that we could see  save low spirits and a thinning of the blood, which made him too weak to  walk. The Father Jean de Lamberville, who had stayed with us, and who  would have been our hope and consolation in those days, very early fell  desperate ill of a distemper, so that the men had not the help of his  ministrations and holy example. Others there were who either from  feebleness or lack of discipline openly refused their daily duty and  went unpunished. We had fair store of brandy; and on Christmas eve those  of us who still held some soul for sport essayed to lighten the hour. We  brewed a comfortable draught, built the blaze high, for the frosts were  getting exceeding sharp, gathered as many as could be had of officers  and worthy men into our cabin, and made brave to sing the songs of  France. And now here was a strange thing: that while the hardiest and  soundest amongst us had made good show of cheer, had eaten the vile food  and tried to speak lightly of our ills, no sooner did we hear our own  voices in the songs that carried us back to the pleasantries of our  native land, than we fell a-sobbing and weeping like children; which  weakness I attribute to the distemper that was already in our blood.    For the days that followed I have no heart to set down much. We never  went without the palisades except well guarded to fetch firewood. This  duty indeed made the burden of every day. A prodigious store of wood was  needed, for the cold surpassed anything I had ever known. The snow fell  heavily, and there were storms when for days the gale drave straight  across our bleak plateau. There was no blood in us to withstand the icy  blasts. Do what we would the chill of the tomb was in the cabins where  the men lay. The wood-choppers one day, facing such a storm, fell in the  deep drifts just outside the gate. None durst go out to them. The second  day the wolves found them--and we saw it all!    There was not a charge of powder left in the fort. There was not a  mouthful of fit food. The biscuits had from the first been full of worms  and weevils. The salted meat, either from the admixture of sea-water  through leaky casks, or from other cause, was rotten beyond the power  even of a starving man to hold.    _Le scorbut_ broke out. I had seen it on shipboard, and knew the signs.  De Troyes now seldom left his cabin; and when, in the way of duty, I  made my devoirs, and he asked after the men, I made shift to hide the  truth. But it could not be for long.    \"My poor fellows,\" he sighed one day, as he turned feebly on his couch  of planks, \"it must be with all as it is with me--see, look here, De  Tregay, do you know the sign?\" and he bared his shrunken arm and side.    Indeed I knew the signs--the dry, pallid skin, with the purple blotches  and indurations. He saw I was at a loss for words.    \"_Sang de Dieu!_\" he cried, \"Is this what soldiers of France must come  to, for the glory of\"----. He stopped short, as if lacking spirit to go  on. \"Now I bethink me,\" he added, in a melancholy voice, \"it _is_ what  soldiers must come to.\" Then, after a while he asked:    \"How many dead today, De Tregay?\"    How many dead! From a garrison of gallant men-at-arms we had become a  charnel-house. In six weeks we had lost sixty men. From a hundred at the  beginning of autumn, we were now scarce forty, and February was not  gone. A few of us, perhaps with stouter stomachs than the rest, did all  the duty of the post. We brought the firewood and we buried the  dead--picking the frozen clods with infinite toil, that we might lay the  bones of our comrades beyond the reach of wolves. Sometimes it was the  scurvy, sometimes it was the cold, sometimes, methinks, it was naught  but a weak will--or as we say, the broken heart; but it mattered not,  the end was the same. More than twenty died in March; and although we  were now but a handful of skeletons and accustomed to death, I had no  thought of sorrow or of grief, so dulled had my spirit become, until one  morning I found the brave De Troyes drawing with frightful pains his  dying breath. With the name of a maid he loved upon his lips, the light  went out; and with heavy heart I buried him in that crowded ground, and  fain would have lain down with him.    And now with our commander under the snow, what little spirit still  burned in the best of us seemed to die down. I too bore the signs of the  distemper, yet to no great extent, for of all the garrison I had labored  by exercise to keep myself wholesome, and in the woods I had tasted of  barks and buds and roots of little herbs, hoping to find something akin  in its juices to the _herbe de scorbut_[8] which I have known to cure  sick sailors. But now I gave over these last efforts for life; for,  thought I, spring is tardy in these latitudes. Many weeks must yet pass  before the noble Marquis at Montreal (where comforts are) will care to  send the promised troop. And the Western savages, our allies the  Illinois, the Ottawais, the Miamis, were they not coming to succor us  here and to raid the Iroquois cantons? But of what account is the  savage's word!    So I thought, and I turned myself on my pallet. I listened. There was no  sound in all the place save the beating of a sleet. \"It is appointed,\" I  said within me. \"Let the end come.\" And presently, being numb with the  cold, I thought I was on a sunny hillside in Anjou. It was the time of  the grape-harvest, and the smell of the vines, laughter and sunshine  filled the air. Young lads and maids, playmates of my boyhood days, came  and took me by the hand....    A twinge of pain made the vision pass. I opened my eyes upon a huge  savage, painted and bedaubed, after their fashion. It was the grip of  his vast fist that had brought me back from Anjou.    \"The Iroquois, then,\" I thought, \"have learned of our extremity, and  have broken in, to finish all. So much the better,\" and I was for  sinking back upon the boards, when the savage took from a little pouch a  handful of the parched corn which they carry on their expeditions.  \"Eat,\" he said, in the language of the Miamis. And then I knew that  relief had come--and I knew no more for a space.    Now this was Michitonka himself, who had led his war party from beyond  Lake Erie, where the Chevalier de Tonty and Du Luth were, to see how we  fared at Fort Denonville, and to make an expedition against the  Senecas--of whom we saw no more, from the time the Miamis arrived. There  were of all our garrison but twelve not dead, and among those who threw  off the distemper was the Father de Lamberville.

The egg  hatches into a larva that absorbs the fatty parts of the body of the  caterpillar, gradually growing larger and larger until at last it  reaches a length of possibly an inch. By this time it is likely to  have absorbed so large a part of the inside of the caterpillar that  the latter dies. The parasite larva now changes to a pupa, either  inside or outside the skin of the caterpillar, and a little later  changes again to an adult Ichneumon fly.       [Illustration: Tachinid Parasite: _a_, fly; _b_, puparium,       magnified.]    In the case just given, one egg only was deposited within the skin of  the caterpillar. In many others, however, a large number of eggs may  be so deposited by a single fly. A special group of Ichneumon flies,  called the Microgasters, contains many parasites that have this  peculiarity. The Microgaster larvae on coming forth from the  caterpillar have the habit of spinning tiny cocoons within which they  change to pupae. By collecting some cabbage worms which are nearly  full grown, and keeping them in a glass jar one can generally get a  considerable number of these Microgaster cocoons and rear the flies  from them.    Another group of caterpillar parasites is still more minute. They are  called the Chalcid flies. Their life-histories are full of interest,  and might easily furnish opportunity for a long lifetime of study and  experiment. One is likely to get hundreds of these Chalcid flies from  a single caterpillar.    Another interesting group of parasites is that of the two-winged  Tachina flies (_see cut on this page_). The life-story of some of  these is comparatively simple: a buzzing fly, looking much like a  large housefly, lays a small whitish egg upon the skin of a  caterpillar. This egg is glued tightly and is large enough to be  readily seen by the unaided eye. It hatches into a tiny larva that  eats its way through the part of the shell glued to the caterpillar's  skin, and through the latter at the same time. So the newly hatched  Tachina larva finds itself in the body of its caterpillar host. It  lives there, absorbing the fatty juices around it until at last it  either kills or stupefies its unfortunate victim. It has then become  full grown as a larva, and its last larval skin hardens into a brown  pupa-case within which the little creature changes into a pupa. It may  or may not have burrowed through the skin of the caterpillar before  this happened. A little later the pupa changes to a Tachina fly which  breaks apart the pupa-case and flies out into the world.    It has lately been found, however, that many Tachinids have much more  complicated life-histories than this. I have already discussed some of  the more important of these in my book entitled, \"Seeing Nature First\"  (_pages 150-158_).    One can frequently rear parasites from the chrysalids of butterflies,  but in many cases it is probable that these began their parasitic  development in the caterpillars, which were able to change to  chrysalids before being killed. In some cases, however, the chrysalids  seem to be attacked, especially by certain Ichneumon flies.          REARING BUTTERFLIES FROM CATERPILLARS      There are few things in the world more interesting to watch than the  wonderful changes which a moth or butterfly goes through in the  course of its life. You find on a tree or shrub a worm-like  caterpillar. You take it in charge, placing it in a box or jar where  you can provide leaves for its food and soon it either spins around  itself a silken shroud, thus hiding from your sight, or else it simply  seems to change to a lifeless object without eyes or wings or legs,  unable to move about and motionless, save for a slight wriggle when  you touch it. Yet if you keep the shroud or the mummy-like object for  two or three weeks you are likely to see a beautiful moth come from  the shroud or a glorious butterfly break out of the mummy case. (_See  plate, page 49._) So you can get the realest kind of moving pictures  by simply bringing in the caterpillars that are easily found in  garden, field, and wood.    To collect these caterpillars it is only necessary to be provided with  a pair of sharp eyes and an empty coffee can or some other form of tin  box. Go out into the garden or along the borders of the woods. Look  carefully. If you see places where leaves have been eaten, search the  leaves near by and you are likely to find one or more of the  caterpillars that caused the injury. Transfer them to the box and take  them home with a few leaves of the food plant. There place them in  some form of vivarium, which simply means a box or cage in which you  can keep living creatures.    The most satisfactory cages for rearing caterpillars are those which  are open above so that there is not even a glass plate between the  observer and the insect. This kind of vivarium is easily made by using  a band of some sticky substance like the tree tanglefoot with which  trees are commonly banded, or a strip of sticky fly paper. Any wide  shallow box may be used by simply placing an inch-wide band of the  sticky material around the vertical sides near the top. The  caterpillars will be free to move all over the open box but they  cannot cross the band to escape. Fresh leaves are easily placed in the  open box and the withered ones removed.    The same plan may be adopted with wide glass jars, like the ordinary  battery jar. Choose a rather large one and smear the inner side near  the top with a band of sticky material. The caterpillars are thus  prevented from crawling out, but they are open to observation at all  times. (_See plate, pages 48-49._)    In the case of the caterpillars that change to butterflies no soil  need be placed in the bottom of the jar as these will attach their  chrysalids to the sides or to a stick or board which may easily be put  in. In the case of many caterpillars that change to moths, however, it  is desirable to place about two inches of soil in the bottom of the  jar. Then if the caterpillars are not cocoon spinners they can burrow  into the soil when they are ready to change to pupae.    Instead of applying the sticky material directly to the glass a strip  of sticky fly paper may be glued to it.    As a rule the butterfly caterpillar easiest to find lives upon  cabbages. Go into the garden and you are likely to see a dozen green  caterpillars upon as many cabbage plants. Bring in several of the  larger ones and place them in a vivarium with some fresh cabbage  leaves. In a few days some of them will be likely to fasten themselves  to the vertical sides of the vivarium and shed the caterpillar skin.  Each thus becomes a chrysalis. About ten days later this chrysalis  skin will break open and a white Cabbage butterfly will come out.    So your caterpillar goes through the four different stages of insect  life. It was first an egg laid upon the leaf by a butterfly; the egg  hatched into the caterpillar or larva; the larva changed to the  chrysalis; the chrysalis changed to the butterfly or adult insect.    One of the most satisfactory ways to rear the caterpillars of  butterflies is to get the females to lay their eggs upon the food  plant. In the case of many species this is not difficult. The simplest  way is to enclose the mother butterfly in a small gauze bag tied over  the branch of the food plant. If she has eggs ready to deposit she is  very likely to lay them under these conditions. After they are laid  the mother butterfly may be allowed to escape, but it is well to  replace the gauze protection as a safeguard against many sorts of  enemies which may destroy the eggs or the young caterpillars that  hatch from them. Another way is to enclose the butterflies with a twig  of the food plant in a glass jar, sealing it tight to prevent the  leaves from wilting. The butterfly is likely after she has quieted  down to lay her eggs upon the leaves. According to William G. Wright,  who speaks from his long experience with the butterflies of the West  Coast, these genera will lay their eggs on anything: Parnassius,  Argynnis, Euptoieta, Neonympha, and all members of the family  Satyridae. In these cases one can get the eggs by simply enclosing the  butterflies in glass jars or gauze nets without even the leaves of the  food plant. William H. Edwards found in his long experience that one  can get the eggs of practically all butterflies in confinement,  provided only the insects are sufficiently mature so that the eggs are  ready to be laid. He found that the cause of failure to get eggs from  many of the Fritillaries early in the season was that the eggs were  not mature and that from the same kinds of butterflies with which he  failed early in the summer he got plenty of eggs in September.    There is here a rich field for observation and experiment for every  naturalist who wishes to take up the study of butterflies. He can be  sure of the parentage of the caterpillars and can trace them from the  very moment of egg-laying through all their wonderful changes until  they become butterflies again.          PHOTOGRAPHING BUTTERFLIES      There is a famous old saying that to make hare stew it is first  necessary to catch your hare. So if one wishes to make perfect  pictures of butterflies it is first necessary to get the caterpillars.  For though caterpillars are not butterflies they are butterflies in  the making and they will show you most interesting stages in nature's  manufacture of these dainty and exquisite creatures. This is not,  however, the chief reason why the photographer should get them. He  will wish to make perfect pictures and in order to do this he must  have not only perfect specimens but living butterflies which are  willing to look pleasant while he makes comparatively long exposures  under conditions of light that he can control. If you catch a  butterfly outdoors and "]]]
