The student should remember that in one respect Figs. 16 and 17 are not  altogether correct representations, since they show the orbits as all  lying in the same plane. If this were strictly true, every planet would  move, like the sun, always along the ecliptic; but in fact all of the  orbits are tilted a little out of the plane of the ecliptic and every  planet in its motion deviates a little from the ecliptic, first to one  side then to the other; but not even Mars, which is the most erratic in  this respect, ever gets more than eight degrees away from the ecliptic,  and for the most part all of them are much closer to the ecliptic than  this limit.          CHAPTER IV    CELESTIAL MECHANICS      32. THE BEGINNINGS OF CELESTIAL MECHANICS.--From the earliest dawn of  civilization, long before the beginnings of written history, the motions  of sun and moon and planets among the stars from constellation to  constellation had commanded the attention of thinking men, particularly  of the class of priests. The religions of which they were the guardians  and teachers stood in closest relations with the movements of the stars,  and their own power and influence were increased by a knowledge of them.    [Illustration: ISAAC NEWTON (1643-1727).]    Out of these professional needs, as well as from a spirit of scientific  research, there grew up and flourished for many centuries a study of the  motions of the planets, simple and crude at first, because the  observations that could then be made were at best but rough ones, but  growing more accurate and more complex as the development of the  mechanic arts put better and more precise instruments into the hands of  astronomers and enabled them to observe with increasing accuracy the  movements of these bodies. It was early seen that while for the most  part the planets, including the sun and moon, traveled through the  constellations from west to east, some of them sometimes reversed their  motion and for a time traveled in the opposite way. This clearly can not  be explained by the simple theory which had early been adopted that a  planet moves always in the same direction around a circular orbit having  the earth at its center, and so it was said to move around in a small  circular orbit, called an epicycle, whose center was situated upon  and moved along a circular orbit, called the deferent, within which the  earth was placed, as is shown in Fig. 18, where the small circle is the  epicycle, the large circle is the deferent, _P_ is the planet, and _E_  the earth. When this proved inadequate to account for the really  complicated movements of the planets, another epicycle was put on top of  the first one, and then another and another, until the supposed system  became so complicated that Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, repudiated  its fundamental theorem and taught that the motions of the planets take  place in circles around the sun instead of about the earth, and that the  earth itself is only one of the planets moving around the sun in its own  appropriate orbit and itself largely responsible for the seemingly  erratic movements of the other planets, since from day to day we see  them and observe their positions from different points of view.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Epicycle and deferent.]    33. KEPLER'S LAWS.--Two generations later came Kepler with his three  famous laws of planetary motion:    I. Every planet moves in an ellipse which has the sun at one of its  foci.    II. The radius vector of each planet moves over equal areas in equal  times.    III. The squares of the periodic times of the planets are proportional  to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.    These laws are the crowning glory, not only of Kepler's career, but of  all astronomical discovery from the beginning up to his time, and they  well deserve careful study and explanation, although more modern  progress has shown that they are only approximately true.    EXERCISE 17.--Drive two pins into a smooth board an inch apart and  fasten to them the ends of a string a foot long. Take up the slack of  the string with the point of a lead pencil and, keeping the string drawn  taut, move the pencil point over the board into every possible position.  The curve thus traced will be an ellipse having the pins at the two  points which are called its foci.    In the case of the planetary orbits one focus of the ellipse is vacant,  and, in accordance with the first law, the center of the sun is at the  other focus. In Fig. 17 the dot, inside the orbit of Mercury, which is  marked _a_, shows the position of the vacant focus of the orbit of Mars,  and the dot _b_ is the vacant focus of Mercury's orbit. The orbits of  Venus and the earth are so nearly circular that their vacant foci lie  very close to the sun and are not marked in the figure. The line drawn  from the sun to any point of the orbit (the string from pin to pencil  point) is a _radius vector_. The point midway between the pins is the  _center_ of the ellipse, and the distance of either pin from the center  measures the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse.    Draw several ellipses with the same length of string, but with the pins  at different distances apart, and note that the greater the eccentricity  the flatter is the ellipse, but that all of them have the same length.    If both pins were driven into the same hole, what kind of an ellipse  would you get?    The Second Law was worked out by Kepler as his answer to a problem  suggested by the first law. In Fig. 17 it is apparent from a mere  inspection of the orbit of Mercury that this planet travels much faster  on one side of its orbit than on the other, the distance covered in ten  days between the numbers 10 and 20 being more than fifty per cent  greater than that between 50 and 60. The same difference is found,  though usually in less degree, for every other planet, and Kepler's  problem was to discover a means by which to mark upon the orbit the  figures showing the positions of the planet at the end of equal  intervals of time. His solution of this problem, contained in the second  law, asserts that if we draw radii vectors from the sun to each of the  marked points taken at equal time intervals around the orbit, then the  area of the sector formed by two adjacent radii vectores and the arc  included between them is equal to the area of each and every other such  sector, the short radii vectores being spread apart so as to include a  long arc between them while the long radii vectores have a short arc. In  Kepler's form of stating the law the radius vector is supposed to travel  with the planet and in each day to sweep over the same fractional part  of the total area of the orbit. The spacing of the numbers in Fig. 17  was done by means of this law.    For the proper understanding of Kepler's Third Law we must note that the  \"mean distance\" which appears in it is one half of the long diameter of  the orbit and that the \"periodic time\" means the number of days or years  required by the planet to make a complete circuit in its orbit.  Representing the first of these by _a_ and the second by _T_, we have,  as the mathematical equivalent of the law,        a^{3} รท T^{2} = C    where the quotient, _C_, is a number which, as Kepler found, is the same  for every planet of the solar system. If we take the mean distance of  the earth from the sun as the unit of distance, and the year as the unit  of time, we shall find by applying the equation to the earth's motion,  _C_ = 1. Applying this value to any other planet we shall find in the  same units, _a_ = _T_^{2/3}, by means of which we may determine the  distance of any planet from the sun when its periodic time, _T_, has  been learned from observation.    EXERCISE 18.--Uranus requires 84 years to make a revolution in its  orbit. What is its mean distance from the sun? What are the mean  distances of Mercury, Venus, and Mars? (See Chapter III for their  periodic times.) Would it be possible for two planets at different  distances from the sun to move around their orbits in the same time?    A circle is an ellipse in which the two foci have been brought together.  Would Kepler's laws hold true for such an orbit?    34. NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION.--Kepler studied and described the motion of  the planets. Newton, three generations later (1727 A. D.), studied and  described the mechanism which controls that motion. To Kepler and his  age the heavens were supernatural, while to Newton and his successors  they are a part of Nature, governed by the same laws which obtain upon  the earth, and we turn to the ordinary things of everyday life as the  foundation of celestial mechanics.    Every one who has ridden a bicycle knows that he can coast farther upon  a level road if it is smooth than if it is rough; but however smooth and  hard the road may be and however fast the wheel may have been started,  it is sooner or later stopped by the resistance which the road and the  air offer to its motion, and when once stopped or checked it can be  started again only by applying fresh power. We have here a familiar  illustration of what is called    THE FIRST LAW OF MOTION.--\"Every body continues in its state of rest or  of uniform motion in a straight line except in so far as it may be  compelled by force to change that state.\" A gust of wind, a stone, a  careless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34848"],[0,"Mammals of the San Gabriel Mountains of California (#9)"],[1,"higher parts of the  mountains would produce specimens of flying squirrels. Willett (1944:19)  mentions that flying squirrels probably occur in the San Gabriel  Mountains.      Family GEOMYIDAE      =Thomomys bottae pallescens= Rhoads    Valley Pocket Gopher    This gopher was found below about 5000 feet elevation in disturbed or  open areas from Cajon Wash at Devore westward all along the coastal base  of the San Gabriel Range. In the lower part of the chaparral belt the  gopher evidently was absent from the chaparral-covered slopes, but was  common along roads and on fire trails.    Burt (1932) and von Bloeker (1932) discuss the distribution of the three  subspecies of this species, _pallescens_, _neglecta_, and _mohavensis_,  which are in the San Gabriel Mountains area, and Burt indicates that  _pallescens_ grades toward _mohavensis_ in the southern part of Antelope  Valley.      =Thomomys bottae neglectus= Bailey    Valley Pocket Gopher    In the forests of yellow pine and white fir of the higher parts of the  San Gabriel Mountains the workings of this gopher were common, and sign  of its presence was found above 4500 feet on both slopes of the mountain  range. The rocky character of the coastal slope seems to limit the  occurrence of gophers, for they are not continuously distributed there.  On the desert slope they occur locally down into the pinyon-juniper  belt.    In the vicinity of Big Pines, on the interior slope, these gophers  preferred broken forest where snow brush or other brush occurred; their  workings, however, were also found beneath groves of conifers and black  oaks. The abundance of earth cores resting on the duff indicated that  this species is active in the snow in winter.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 5, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 2 mi. E Valyermo, 4600 ft., 2; 3 mi. W Big      Pines, 6000 ft., 1; 1 mi. S and 2 mi. E Big Pines, 8000 ft., 2.      =Thomomys bottae mohavensis= Grinnell    Valley Pocket Gopher    One specimen of this subspecies was taken on December 31, 1951, in the  Joshua tree belt, eight miles east of Llano, 3700 feet elevation.      Family HETEROMYIDAE      =Perognathus fallax fallax= Merriam    San Diego Pocket Mouse    This pocket mouse is restricted to the coastal sage scrub association,  and was recorded from Cajon Wash west to Live Oak Canyon. The mouse does  not inhabit even the lower edge of the chaparral belt, but in the  coastal sage flats is usually the most abundant rodent. In disturbed  parts of the coastal sage belt _fallax_ is less common, and was never  trapped in channels of rocky washes. Trap lines in the eroded adobe  banks of the foothills, where white sage and coastal sagebrush are the  dominant plants, took mostly these pocket mice. Although the soil of  such slopes is compact and seemingly is unsuitable for burrowing by  heteromyids, _fallax_ is the most common rodent. Because few burrows of  pocket mice were noted there, it is possible that the many old unused  burrows of _Spermophilus_ and _Dipodomys_ which honeycomb certain parts  of adobe banks are used also by _fallax_; some of these burrows  shelter _Peromyscus eremicus_ and _Peromyscus californicus_.    These mice are inactive above ground in cold weather. In the sage belt  near Thompson Canyon, where this subspecies had been found to be the  most common rodent, none was trapped on the sub-freezing night of  December 3, 1948, although other rodents were found in usual numbers.  Individuals have been taken on nights of intermittent rain, yet none has  been trapped on freezing nights.    This species is characteristically heavily infested by a large species  of mite. Usually these mites congregate around the base of the tail.    On October 11, 1949, one lactating female and two carrying embryos were  taken.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 4 mi. N and 1 mi. E Claremont, 1900 ft., 5; 3      mi. N Claremont, 1600 ft., 6 (5 PC).      =Perognathus fallax pallidus= Mearns    San Diego Pocket Mouse    On the desert slope of the mountains this species is found in the part  of the pinyon-juniper association that is between elevations of 4000 and  5200 feet. The mouse is absent from the higher chaparral and  pinyon-covered slopes, but is present on south slopes in the pinyon belt  where more open growths of pinyons and scrub oaks are interspersed with  yucca. I recorded this pocket mouse from the vicinity of Cajon Pass west  to Valyermo.    The local distribution of _pallidus_ is striking because of its close  positive correlation with the distribution of yucca. On benches around  5000 feet, where yuccas are scattered in their occurrence, _pallidus_ is  nearly always taken near (often right at the base of) this plant. Lower  in the juniper belt the dry rocky south slopes supporting yucca plants  are well populated by _pallidus_, while adjacent flats, and north slopes  grown to antelope brush and scrub oak, are completely uninhabited. Near  the mouth of Grandview Canyon, on steep rocky southern exposures grown  sparsely to burro weed and yucca, one hundred traps produced in one  night eight _pallidus_ and no other rodents. Here many of these pocket  mice were trapped on large fractured rock outcroppings, where most or  all of the mice probably lived in the daytime in the deep cracks; in any  event no burrows were noted near these rocks.    This species prefers barren slopes supporting yucca plants. These plants  produce large seeds which are staple food items for _P. f. pallidus_ and  other rodents during the lean part of the year, that is to say, late  summer and autumn. Many of the dry capsules of the yucca plants were  examined in October, 1951, and these generally still contained a few  seeds. Pocket mice taken in October usually carried in their cheek  pouches seeds of yucca together with some other material, and often they  carried only the seeds of yucca. Probably the wind shakes only a few  seeds out of the capsules at a time, thus tending to drop the seeds over  a fairly long period.    Trapping in winter in the juniper belt revealed that these pocket mice  were not active above ground on nights colder than about 40 deg. F. On  nights when the temperature was about 36 deg. F. none was taken, but on the  one night in late December, 1948, when the minimum was 44 deg. F., several  specimens were taken. In this same area in May 1949, pocket mice were  the most numerous rodents. Because of their evident sensitivity to cold  weather, these mice must remain below ground for weeks at a time during  the cold weather of December and January.    Specimens of _pallidus_ from the desert slope of the San Gabriels are  grayer (less brown) than specimens taken farther southeast in the Mojave  and Colorado deserts. Further sampling of populations of _Perognathus  fallax_ from areas adjacent to the San Gabriels might demonstrate  differences of sufficient magnitude to warrant subspecific distinction  of the San Gabriel population. Possibly, however, the San Gabriel series  manifests only local variation in the race _pallidus_. Grinnell  (1933:54) characterizes the ecological niche of the race _pallidus_ as  being \"open, sandy ground, often ... surrounded by rocky slopes,\"  whereas these pocket mice in the San Gabriels inhabited gravelly or  rocky juniper-dotted benches.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 5 mi. E and 4 mi. S Llano, 4500 ft., 7; 2 mi. E      Valyermo, 4500 ft., 3; 4 mi. E Valyermo, 5000 ft., 1.      =Perognathus californicus dispar= Osgood    California Pocket Mouse    Mice of this subspecies were recorded from the lower chaparral  association below about 4000 feet elevation along the coastal face of  the San Gabriel Range. They were trapped on greasewood-covered slopes,  in mixed growths of white sage and buckwheat, and beneath scrub oak  and lilac chaparral; however none was taken in the heavy chaparral of  the upper parts of the chaparral association.    One small juvenile in gray pelage was taken in San Antonio Canyon on  October 1, 1951.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 5, distributed as follows: San      Bernardino County: Lytle Canyon, 4000 ft., 2 (PC). Los Angeles      County: San Antonio Canyon, 3000 ft., 3.      =Perognathus californicus bernardinus= Benson    California Pocket Mouse    On Blue Ridge these mice were recorded between 7100 and 8000 feet  elevation. Here they were restricted to dense tracts of snowbrush and  sagebrush, often where these tracts were interspersed with, or beneath,  open groves of conifers. These mice seemed to favor areas where this  thick brush was broken by patches of open, grass-covered ground. Benson  (1930:450) records this subspecies from Swarthout Valley, near Big  Pines, at 6860 feet elevation.    While setting traps for pocket gophers one mile southwest of Big Pines,  in September of 1951, I frightened a pocket mouse from its burrow. The  animal jumped into the tangle of interlacing twigs of a nearby clump of  snowbrush, and with great dexterity climbed into the center of the bush,  where it was lost to view. I was surprised at the facility with which  this saltatorial rodent traveled through the network of small branches.    In winter, in areas inhabited by this mouse, snow covers the ground for  long periods during which these mice are probably forced to remain below  ground.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: 1 mi.

It occurs  regularly along the entire desert slope of the San Gabriel Mountains.    The upper limit of the range of this species roughly coincides with the  upper limit of the juniper belt, and within this range it was found"]]]
