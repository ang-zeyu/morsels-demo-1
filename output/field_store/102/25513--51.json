Dr. E. von Martens in  'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' March 1866 page 209.) are as often sinistral  as dextral. I will give an analogous case in the great articulate kingdom: the  two sides of Verruca (13/62. Darwin 'Balanidae' Ray Soc. 1854 page 499: see  also the appended remarks on the apparently capricious development of the  thoracic limbs on the right and left sides in the higher crustaceans.) are so  wonderfully unlike, that without careful dissection it is extremely difficult  to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite sides of the body; yet it  is apparently a mere matter of chance whether it be the right or the left side  that undergoes so singular amount of change. One plant is known to me (13/63.  Mormodes ignea: Darwin 'Fertilisation of Orchids' 1862 page 251.) in which the  flower, according as it stands on the one or other side of the spike, is  unequally developed. In all the foregoing cases the two sides are perfectly  symmetrical at an early period of growth. Now, whenever a species is as liable  to be unequally developed on the one as on the other side, we may infer that  the capacity for such development is present, though latent, in the  undeveloped side. And as a reversal of development occasionally occurs in  animals of many kinds, this latent capacity is probably very common.    The best yet simplest cases of characters lying dormant are, perhaps, those  previously given, in which chickens and young pigeons, raised from a cross  between differently coloured birds, are at first of one colour, but in a year  or two acquire feathers of the colour of the other parent; for in this case  the tendency to a change of plumage is clearly latent in the young bird. So it  is with hornless breeds of cattle, some of which acquire small horns as they  grow old. Purely bred black and white bantams, and some other fowls,  occasionally assume, with advancing years, the red feathers of the parent-  species. I will here add a somewhat different case, as it connects in a  striking manner latent characters of two classes. Mr. Hewitt (13/64. 'Journal  of Horticulture' July 1864 page 38. I have had the opportunity of examining  these remarkable feathers through the kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier.) possessed  an excellent Sebright gold-laced bantam hen, which, as she became old, grew  diseased in her ovaria, and assumed male characters. In this breed the males  resemble the females in all respects except in their combs, wattles, spurs,  and instincts; hence it might have been expected that the diseased hen would  have assumed only those masculine characters which are proper to the breed,  but she acquired, in addition, well-arched tail sickle-feathers quite a foot  in length, saddle-feathers on the loins, and hackles on the neck,--ornaments  which, as Mr. Hewitt remarks, \"would be held as abominable in this breed.\" The  Sebright bantam is known (13/65. 'The Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866  page 241.) to have originated about the year 1800 from a cross between a  common bantam and a Polish fowl, recrossed by a hen-tailed bantam, and  carefully selected; hence there can hardly be a doubt that the sickle-feathers  and hackles which appeared in the old hen were derived from the Polish fowl or  common bantam; and we thus see that not only certain masculine characters  proper to the Sebright bantam, but other masculine characters derived from the  first progenitors of the breed, removed by a period of above sixty years, were  lying latent in this henbird, ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became  diseased.    From these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters,  capacities, and instincts, may lie latent in an individual, and even in a  succession of individuals, without our being able to detect the least sign of  their presence. When fowls, pigeons, or cattle of different colours are  crossed, and their offspring change colour as they grow old, or when the  crossed turbit acquired the characteristic frill after its third moult, or  when rarely-bred bantams partially assume the red plumage of their prototype,  we cannot doubt that these qualities were from the first present, though  latent, in the individual animal, like the characters of a moth in the  caterpillar. Now, if these animals had produced offspring before they had  acquired with advancing age their new characters, nothing is more probable  than that they would have transmitted them to some of their offspring, who in  this case would in appearance have received such characters from their grand-  parents or more distant progenitors. We should then have had a case of  reversion, that is, of the reappearance in the child of an ancestral  character, actually present, though during youth completely latent, in the  parent; and this we may safely conclude is what occurs in all reversions to  progenitors, however remote.    This view of the latency in each generation of all the characters which appear  through reversion, is also supported by their actual presence in some cases  during early youth alone, or by their more frequent appearance and greater  distinctness at this age than during maturity. We have seen that this is often  the case with the stripes on the legs and faces of the several species of the  horse genus. The Himalayan rabbit, when crossed, sometimes produces offspring  which revert to the parent silver-grey breed, and we have seen that in purely  bred animals pale-grey fur occasionally reappears during early youth. Black  cats, we may feel assured, would occasionally produce by reversion tabbies;  and on young black kittens, with a pedigree (13/66. Carl Vogt 'Lectures on  Man' English translation 1864 page 411.) known to have been long pure, faint  traces of stripes may almost always be seen which afterwards disappear.  Hornless Suffolk cattle occasionally produce by reversion horned animals; and  Youatt (13/67. 'On Cattle' page 174.) asserts that even in hornless  individuals \"the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early age.\"    No doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable that in  every horse of every generation there should be a latent capacity and tendency  to produce stripes, though these may not appear once in a thousand  generations; that in every white, black, or other coloured pigeon, which may  have transmitted its proper colour during centuries, there should be a latent  capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be marked with certain  characteristic bars; that in every child in a six-fingered family there should  be the capacity for the production of an additional digit; and so in other  cases. Nevertheless, there is no more inherent improbability in this being the  case than in a useless and rudimentary organ, or even in only a tendency to  the production of a rudimentary organ, being inherited during millions of  generations, as is well known to occur with a multitude of organic beings.  There is no more inherent improbability in each domestic pig, during a  thousand generations, retaining the capacity and tendency to develop great  tusks under fitting conditions, than in the young calf having retained, for an  indefinite number of generations rudimentary incisor teeth, which never  protrude through the gums.    I shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three preceding  chapters; but as isolated and striking cases of reversion have here been  chiefly insisted on, I wish to guard the reader against supposing that  reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination of circumstances. When  a character, lost during hundreds of generations, suddenly reappears, no doubt  some such combination must occur; but reversions, to the immediately preceding  generations may be constantly observed, at least, in the offspring of most  unions. This has been universally recognised in the case of hybrids and  mongrels, but it has been recognised simply from the difference between the  united forms rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their grandparents  or more remote progenitors of easy detection. Reversion is likewise almost  invariably the rule, as Mr. Sedgwick has shown, with certain diseases. Hence  we must conclude that a tendency to this peculiar form of transmission is an  integral part of the general law of inheritance.    MONSTROSITIES.    A large number of monstrous growths and of lesser anomalies are admitted by  every one to be due to an arrest of development, that is, to the persistence  of an embryonic condition. But many monstrosities cannot be thus explained;  for parts of which no trace can be detected in the embryo, but which occur in  other members of the same class of animals occasionally appear, and these may  probably with truth be attributed to reversion. As, however, I have treated  this subject as fully as I could in my 'Descent of Man' (ch. 1 2nd edition), I  will not here recur to it.    [When flowers which have normally an irregular structure become regular or  peloric, the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return to the  primitive state. But Dr. Maxwell Masters (13/68. 'Natural Hist. Review' April  1863 page 258. See also his Lecture, Royal Institution, March 16, 1860. On  same subject see Moquin-Tandon 'Elements de Teratologie' 1841 pages 184, 352.  Dr. Peyritsch has collected a large number of very interesting cases 'Sitzb.  d. k. Akad. d. Wissensch.' Wien b. 60 and especially b. 66 1872 page 125.),  who has ably discussed this subject, remarks that when, for instance, all the  sepals of a Tropaeolum become green and of the same shape, instead of being  coloured with one prolonged into a spur, or when all the petals of a Linaria  become simple and regular, such cases may be due merely to an arrest of  development; for in these flowers all the organs during their earliest  condition are symmetrical, and, if arrested at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#9)"],[1,"f, distance 2\", p. 5 deg.; the second, of the tenth magnitude, distance  45\", p. 292 deg.; and the third, of the tenth magnitude, distance 125\", p.  350 deg..    We should look at the double Sigma 616 with one of our larger apertures  in order to determine for ourselves what the colors of the components  are. There is considerable diversity of opinion on this point. Some say  the larger star is pale red and the smaller light blue; others consider  the color of the larger star to be greenish, and some have even called  it white. The magnitudes are five and nine, distance 6\", p. 350 deg..    Auriga contains several noteworthy clusters which will be found on the  map. The most beautiful of these is 1295, in which about five hundred  stars have been counted.    The position of the new star of 1892, known as Nova Aurigae, is also  indicated on the map. While this never made a brilliant appearance, it  gave rise to a greater variety of speculative theories than any previous  phenomenon of the kind. Although not recognized until January 24, 1892,  this star, as photographic records prove, was in existence on December  9, 1891. At its brightest it barely exceeded magnitude four and a half,  and its maximum occurred within ten days after its first recognition.  When discovered it was of the fifth magnitude. It was last seen in its  original form with the Lick telescope on April 26th, when it had sunk to  the lowest limit of visibility. To everybody's astonishment it  reappeared in the following August, and on the 17th of that month was  seen shining with the light of a tenth-magnitude star, _but presenting  the spectrum of a nebula!_ Its visual appearance in the great telescope  was now also that of a planetary nebula. Its spectrum during the first  period of its visibility had been carefully studied, so that the means  existed for making a spectroscopic comparison of the phenomenon in its  two phases. During the first period, when only a stellar spectrum was  noticed, remarkable shiftings of the spectral lines occurred, indicating  that two and perhaps three bodies were concerned in the production of  the light of the new star, one of which was approaching the earth, while  the other or the others receded with velocities of several hundred miles  per second! On the revival in the form of a planetary nebula, while the  character of the spectrum had entirely changed, evidences of rapid  motion in the line of sight remained.    But what was the meaning of all this? Evidently a catastrophe of some  kind had occurred out there in space. The idea of a collision involving  the transformation of the energy of motion into that of light and heat  suggests itself at once. But what were the circumstances of the  collision? Did an extinguished sun, flying blindly through space, plunge  into a vast cloud of meteoric particles, and, under the lashing impact  of so many myriads of missiles, break into superficial incandescence,  while the cosmical wrack through which it had driven remained glowing  with nebulous luminosity? Such an explanation has been offered by  Seeliger. Or was Vogel right when he suggested that Nova Aurigae could  be accounted for by supposing that a wandering dark body had run into  collision with a system of planets surrounding a decrepit sun (and  therefore it is to be hoped uninhabited), and that those planets had  been reduced to vapor and sent spinning by the encounter, the second  outburst of light being caused by an outlying planet of the system  falling a prey to the vagabond destroyer? Or some may prefer the  explanation, based on a theory of Wilsing's, that _two_ great bodies,  partially or wholly opaque and non-luminous at their surfaces, but  liquid hot within, approached one another so closely that the tremendous  strain of their tidal attraction burst their shells asunder so that  their bowels of fire gushed briefly visible, amid a blaze of spouting  vapors. And yet Lockyer thinks that there was no solid or semisolid mass  concerned in the phenomenon at all, but that what occurred was simply  the clash of two immense swarms of meteors that had crossed one  another's track.    Well, where nobody positively knows, everybody has free choice. In the  meantime, look at the spot in the sky where that little star made its  appearance and underwent its marvelous transformation, for, even if you  can see no remains of it there, you will feel your interest in the  problem it has presented, and in the whole subject of astronomy, greatly  heightened and vivified, as the visitor to the field of Waterloo becomes  a lover of history on the spot.    The remaining objects of special interest in Auriga may be briefly  mentioned: 26, triple star, magnitudes five, eight, and eleven,  distances 12\", p. 268 deg., and 26\", p. 113 deg.; 14, triple star, magnitudes  five, seven and a half, and eleven, distances 14\", p. 224 deg., and 12.6\",  p. 342 deg., the last difficult for moderate apertures; lambda, double,  magnitudes five and nine, distance 121\", p. 13 deg.; epsilon, variable,  generally of third magnitude, but has been seen of only four and a half  magnitude; 41, double, magnitudes five and six, distance 8\", p. 354 deg.;  996, 1067, 1119, and 1166, clusters all well worth inspection, 1119  being especially beautiful.    The inconspicuous Lynx furnishes some fine telescopic objects, all  grouped near the northwestern corner of the constellation. Without a  six-inch telescope it would be a waste of time to attack the double star  4, whose components are of sixth and eighth magnitudes, distance 0.8\",  p. 103 deg.; but its neighbor, 5, a fine triple, is within our reach, the  magnitudes being six, ten, and eight, distances 30\", p. 139 deg., and 96\",  p. 272 deg.. In 12 Lyncis we find one of the most attractive of triple  stars, which in good seeing weather is not beyond the powers of a  three-inch glass, although we shall have a far more satisfactory view of  it with the four-inch. The components are of the sixth, seventh, and  eighth magnitudes, distances 1.4\", p. 117 deg., and 8.7\", p. 304 deg.. A  magnifying power which just suffices clearly to separate the disks of  the two nearer stars makes this a fine sight. A beautiful contrast of  colors belongs to the double star 14, but unfortunately the star is at  present very close, the distance between its sixth and seventh magnitude  components not exceeding 0.8\", position angle 64 deg.. Sigma 958 is a pretty  double, both stars being of the sixth magnitude, distance 5\", p. 257 deg..  Still finer is Sigma 1009, a double, whose stars are both a little above  the seventh magnitude and nearly equal, distance 3\", p. 156 deg.. A low  power suffices to show the three stars in 19, their magnitudes being six  and a half, seven and a half, and eight, distances 15\", p. 312 deg., and  215\", p. 358 deg.. Webb describes the two smaller stars as plum-colored.  Plum-colored suns!    At the opposite end of the constellation are two fine doubles, Sigma  1333, magnitudes six and a half and seven, distance 1.4\", p. 39 deg.; and  38, magnitudes four and seven, distance 2.9\", p. 235 deg..    Under the guidance of map No. 6 we turn to Leo, which contains one of  the leading gems among the double stars, gamma, whose components, of the  second and fourth magnitudes, are respectively yellow and green, the  green star, according to some observers, having a peculiar tinge of red.  Their distance apart is 3.7\", p. 118 deg., and they are undoubtedly in  revolution about a common center, the probable period being about four  hundred years. The three-inch glass should separate them easily when the  air is steady, and a pleasing sight they are.    The star iota is a closer double, and also very pretty, magnitudes four  and eight, colors lemon and light blue, distance 2.17\", p. 53 deg.. Other  doubles are tau, magnitudes five and seven, distance 95\", p. 170 deg.; 88,  magnitudes seven and nine, distance 15\", p. 320 deg.; 90, triple, magnitudes  six, seven and a half, and ten, distance, 3.5\", p. 209 deg., and 59\", p.  234 deg.; 54, magnitudes four and a half and seven, distance 6.2\", p. 102 deg.;  and 49, magnitudes six and nine, distance 2.4\", p. 158 deg..    Leo contains a remarkable variable star, R, deep red in color, and  varying in a space of a hundred and forty-four days from the fifth to  the tenth magnitude. It has also several nebulae, of which only one needs  special mention, No. 1861. This is spindle-shaped, and large telescopes  show that it consists of three nebulae. The observer with ordinary  instruments finds little to see and little to interest him in these  small, faint nebulae.    We may just glance at two double stars in the small constellation of  Sextans, situated under Leo. These are: 9, magnitudes seven and eight,  distance 53\", p. 292 deg.; and 35, magnitudes six and seven, distance 6.9\",  p. 240 deg..    [Illustration: MAP NO. 6.]    Coma Berenices (map No. 6) includes several interesting objects. Let  us begin with the star 2, a double, of magnitudes six and seven and a  half, distance 3.6\", p. 240 deg.. The color of the smaller star is lilac.  This hue, although not extremely uncommon among double stars elsewhere,  recurs again and again, with singular persistence, in this little  constellation. For instance, in the very next star that we look at, 12,  we find a double whose smaller component is _lilac_. The magnitudes in  12 are five and eight, distance 66\", p. 168 deg.. So also the wide double  17, magnitudes five and a half and six, distance 145\", exhibits a tinge  of _lilac_ in the smaller component; the triple 35, magnitudes five,  eight, and nine, distances 1\", p. 77 deg., and 28.7\", p. 124 deg., has four  colors yellow, _lilac_, and blue, and the double 24, magnitudes five and  six, distance 20\", p. 270 deg., combines an orange with a _lilac_ star, a  very striking and beautiful contrast. We should make a mistake if we  regarded this wonderful distribution of color"]]]
