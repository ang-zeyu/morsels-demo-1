Concede his position, and for fortune  or disgrace he was equally prepared. Harley and Bolingbroke, quick to  discern the weakness, called their invulnerable ally by his Christian  name, but stopped short of conferring upon him any benefit whatever. The  neglect made no difference to the haughty scribe, who contented himself  with pulling down the barriers that had been impertinently set up to  separate him from rank and worldly greatness. But, if Swift shrank from  the treatment of a client, he performed no part so willingly as that of  a patron. He took literature under his wing and compelled the Government  to do it homage. He quarreled with Steele when he deserted the Whigs,  and pursued his former friend with unflinching sarcasm and banter, but  at his request Steele was maintained by the Government in an office of  which he was about to be deprived. Congreve was a Whig, but Swift  insisted that he should find honor at the hands of the Tories, and  Harley honored him accordingly. Swift introduced Gay to Lord  Bolingbroke, and secured that nobleman's weighty patronage for the poet.  Rowe was recommended for office, Pope for aid. The well-to-do, by  Swift's personal interest, found respect, the indigent, money for the  mitigation of their pains. At Court, at Swift's instigation, the Lord  Treasurer made the first advances to men of letters, and by the act made  tacit confession of the power which Swift so liberally exercised, for  the advantage of everybody but himself. But what worldly distinction, in  truth, could add to the importance of a personage who made it a point  for a Duke to pay him the first visit, and who, on one occasion,  publicly sent the Prime Minister into the House of Commons to call out  the First Secretary of State, whom Swift wished to inform that he would  not dine with him if he meant to dine late?    A lampoon directed against the Queen's favorite, upon whose red hair  Swift had been facetious, prevented the satirist's advancement in  England. The see of Hereford fell vacant in 1712. Bolingbroke would now  have paid the debt due from his Government to Swift, but the Duchess of  Somerset, upon her knees, implored the Queen to withhold her consent  from the appointment, and Swift was pronounced by Her Majesty as \"too  violent in party\" for promotion. The most important man in the kingdom  found himself in a moment the most feeble. The fountain of so much honor  could not retain a drop of the precious waters for itself. Swift, it is  said, laid the foundations of fortune for upward of forty families who  rose to distinction by a word from his lips. What a satire upon power  was the satirist's own fate! He could not advance himself in England one  inch. Promotion in Ireland began and ended with his appointment to the  Deanery of St. Patrick, of which he took possession, much to his disgust  and vexation, in the summer of 1713.    The summer, however, was not over before Swift was in England again. The  wheels of government had come to a dead lock, and of course none but he  could right them. The Ministry was at sixes and sevens. Its very  existence depended upon the good understanding of the chiefs,  Bolingbroke and Harley, and the wily ambition of the latter, jarring  against the vehement desires of the former, had produced jealousy,  suspicion, and now threatened immediate disorganization. A thousand  voices called the Dean to the scene of action, and he came full of the  importance of his mission. He plunged at once into the vexed sea of  political controversy, and whilst straining every effort to court his  friends, let no opportunity slip of galling their foes. His pen was as  damaging and industrious as ever. It set the town in a fever. It caused  Richard Steele to be expelled from the House of Commons, and it sent the  whole body of Scotch peers, headed by the Duke of Argyle, to the Queen,  with the prayer that a proclamation might be issued for the discovery of  their libeller. Swift was more successful in his assaults than in its  mediation. The Ministers were irreconcilable. Vexed at heart with  disappointment, the Dean, after his manner, suddenly quitted London, and  shut himself up in Berkshire. One attempt he made in his strict  seclusion to uphold the Government and save the country, and the  composition is a curiosity in its way. He published a proposition for  the exclusion of all Dissenters from power of every kind, for  disqualifying Whigs and Low Churchmen for every possible office, and for  compelling the presumptive heir to the throne to declare his abomination  of Whigs, and his perfect satisfaction with Her Majesty's present  advisers. Matters must have been near a crisis when this modest pamphlet  was put forth; and so they were. By his intrigues Bolingbroke had  triumphed over his colleagues, and Oxford was disgraced. The latter,  about to retire into obscurity, addressed a letter to Swift, entreating  him, if he were not tired of his former prosperous friend, \"to throw  away so much time on one who loved him as to attend him upon his  melancholy journey.\" The same post brought him word that his own victory  was won. Bolingbroke triumphant besought his Jonathan, as he loved his  Queen, to stand by her Minister, and to aid him in his perilous  adventure. Nothing should be wanting to do justice to his loyalty. The  Duchess of Somerset would be reconciled, the Queen would be gracious,  the path of honor should lie broad, open, and unimpeded before him.  Bolingbroke and Harley were equally the friends of Swift. What could he  do in his extremity? What would a million men, taken at random from the  multitude, have done, had they been so situated, so tempted? Not that  upon which Swift in his chivalrous magnanimity, at once decided. He  abandoned the prosperous to follow and console the unfortunate. \"I  meddle not with Lord Oxford's faults,\" is his noble language, \"as he was  a Minister of State, but his personal kindness to me was excessive. He  distinguished and chose me above all men when he was great.\" Within a  few days of Swift's self-denying decision Queen Anne was a corpse,  Bolingbroke and Oxford both flying for their lives, and Swift himself  hiding his unprotected head in Ireland amidst a people who at once  feared and hated him.    During Swift's visit to London in 1710 he had regularly transmitted to  Stella, by which name Esther Johnson is made known to posterity, an  account of his daily doings with the new Government. The journal  exhibits the view of the writer that his conduct invariably presents. It  is full of tenderness and confidence, and not without coarseness that  startles and shocks. It contains a detailed and minute account, not only  of all that passed between Swift and the Government, but of his  changeful feelings as they arose from day to day, and of his physical  infirmities, that are commonly whispered into the ear of a physician. If  Swift loved Stella in the ordinary acceptation of the term, he took  small pains in his diary to elevate the sentiments with which she  regarded her hero. The journal is not in harmony throughout. Toward the  close it lacks the tenderness and warmth, the minuteness and  confidential utterance, that are so visible at the beginning. We are  enabled to account for the difference. Swift had enlarged the circle of  his female acquaintance whilst fighting for his friends in London. He  had become a constant visitor, especially, at the house of a Mrs.  Vanhomrigh, who had two daughters, the eldest of whom was about twenty  years of age, and had the same Christian name as Stella. Esther  Vanhomrigh had great taste for reading, and Swift, who seems to have  delighted in such occupation, condescended, for the second time in his  life, to become a young lady's instructor. The great man's tuition had  always one effect upon his pupils. Before Miss Vanhomrigh had made much  progress in her studies she was over head and ears in love, and, to the  astonishment of her master, she one day declared the passionate and  undying character of her attachment. Swift met the confession with a  weapon far more potent when opposed to a political foe than when  directed against the weak heart of a doting woman. He had recourse to  raillery, but, finding his banter of no avail, endeavored to appease the  unhappy girl by \"an offer of devoted and everlasting friendship, founded  on the basis of virtuous esteem.\" He might with equal success have  attempted to put out a conflagration with a bucket of cold water. There  was no help for the miserable man. He returned to his deanery at the  death of Queen Anne with two love affairs upon his hands, but with the  stern resolution of encouraging neither, and overcoming both.    Before quitting England he wrote to Esther Vanhomrigh, or Vanessa, as he  styles her in his correspondence, intimating his intention to forget  everything in England and to write to her as seldom as possible. So far  the claims of Vanessa were disposed of. As soon as he reached his  deanery he secured lodgings for Stella and her companion, and reiterated  his determination to pursue his intercourse with the young lady upon the  prudent terms originally established. So far his mind was set at rest in  respect of Stella. But Swift had scarcely time to congratulate himself  upon his plans before Vanessa presented herself in Dublin, and made  known to the Dean her resolution to take up her abode permanently in  Ireland. Her mother was dead, so were her two brothers; she and her  sister were alone in the world, and they had a small property near  Dublin, to which it suited them to retire. Swift, alarmed by the  proceeding, remonstrated, threatened, denounced--all in vain. Vanessa  met his reproaches with complaints of cruelty and neglect, and warned  him of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#9)"],[1,", so far as we can make out, never essayed the baryton again,  but he wrote a surprising amount of music for it, considering its  complicated mechanism and the weakness of its tone. In the catalogue  of his works there are no fewer than 175 compositions for the  instrument--namely, six duets for two barytons, twelve sonatas for  baryton and violoncello, twelve divertimenti for two barytons and bass,  and 125 divertimenti for baryton, viola and violoncello; seventeen  so-called \"cassations\"; and three concertos for baryton, with  accompaniment of two violins and bass. There is no need to say anything  about these compositions, inasmuch as they have gone to oblivion with  the instrument which called them into being. At the best they can never  have been of much artistic importance.    A Reproval    A new epoch began at Eisenstadt with the rule of Prince Nicolaus. He  was a man of unbounded energy himself, and he expected everybody in  his service to be energetic too. There is nothing to suggest that Haydn  neglected any of his routine duties, which certainly gave him abundant  opportunity to \"break the legs of time,\" but once, at least--in  1765--his employer taxed him with lack of diligence in composition,  as well as for failing to maintain the necessary discipline among the  musicians under his charge. It is likely enough that Haydn was not a  rigid disciplinarian; but it must have been a mere whim on the part of  Prince Nicolaus to reprove him on the score of laziness in composing.  In any case, it seems to have been only a solitary reproof. There is no  evidence of its having been repeated, and we may assume that even now  it was not regarded as a very serious matter, from the fact that three  weeks after the prince was requesting his steward to pay Haydn 12 ducats  for three new pieces, with which he was \"very much pleased.\"    Operettas    Life at Eisenstadt moved on in \"calm peace and quiet,\" but now and again  it was stirred into special activity, when Haydn had to put forth his  efforts in various new directions. Such an occasion came very early in  his service of Prince Nicolaus, when that pompous person made triumphant  entry into Eisenstadt. The festivities were on a regal scale and  continued for a whole month. A company of foreign players had been  engaged to perform on a stage erected in the large conservatory, and  Haydn was required to provide them with operettas. He wrote several  works of the kind, one of which, \"La Marchesa Nepola,\" survives in the  autograph score. Later on, for the marriage of Count Anton, the eldest  son of Prince Nicolaus, in 1763, he provided a setting of the story  which Handel had already used for his \"Acis and Galatea.\" This work,  which was performed by the Eisenstadt Capelle, with the orchestra  clad in a new uniform of crimson and gold, bore the name of \"Acide e  Galatea.\" Portions of the score still exist--a section of the overture,  four arias, and a finale quartet. The overture is described as being  \"in his own style, fresh and cheerful, foreshadowing his symphonies.  The songs are in the Italian manner, very inferior in originality  and expression to Handel's music; the quartet is crude in form and  uninteresting in substance.\" [See Miss Townsend's Haydn, p. 44.]    It would seem rather ungracious, as it would certainly be redundant to  discuss these \"occasional\" works in detail. For one thing, the material  necessary to enable us to form a correct estimate of Haydn's powers as a  dramatic composer is wanting. The original autograph of \"Armida,\" first  performed in 1783, is, indeed, preserved. \"Orfeo ed Euridice,\" written  for the King's Theatre in the Haymarket in 1791, but never staged, was  printed at Leipzig in 1806, and a fair idea of the general style of  the work may be obtained from the beautiful air, \"Il pensier sta negli  oggetti,\" included in a collection entitled \"Gemme d'Antichita.\" But  beyond these and the fragments previously mentioned, there is little  left to represent Haydn as a composer of opera, the scores of most of  the works written expressly for Prince Esterhazy having been destroyed  when the prince's private theatre was burned down in 1779. What Haydn  would have done for opera if he had devoted his serious attention to  it at any of the larger theatres it is, of course, impossible to say.  Judging from what has survived of his work in this department, he was  notable for refinement rather than for dramatic power. We must, however,  remember the conditions under which he worked. He confessed himself that  his operas were fitted only for the small stage at Esterhaz and \"could  never produce the proper effect elsewhere.\" If he had written with a  large stage in view, it may reasonably be assumed that he would have  written somewhat differently.    Occasional Works    In 1764 Prince Nicolaus made a journey to Frankfort for the coronation  of the Archduke Joseph as King of the Romans. After the festivities  connected with that imposing function were over he extended his journey  to Paris, where he created some sensation by his extravagant displays  of wealth and circumstance. During the Prince's absence Haydn  busied himself on a couple of compositions intended to celebrate his  home-coming. One was a Te Deum, the other a cantata. The latter work is  the more worthy of remark, not because of its music, but because of  the fulsomely obsequious manner in which it celebrates the graces and  virtues of Nicolaus the Magnificent. The cantata is made up of choruses  and duets, a recitative and two arias. Parts of it were afterwards  employed in church services. The Te Deum is in C major, and is for four  voices with orchestra. It is interesting as an early work, especially if  we compare it with the greater Te Deum in the same key composed in the  year 1800.    First Symphonies    At this point a summary may perhaps be made of the compositions written  by Haydn during these five years a Eisenstadt. The list, as given by  Pohl, comprises, in addition to the works already named, about thirty  symphonies six string trios, a few divertimenti in five parts, a piece  for four violins and two 'celli, entitled \"Echo,\" twelve minuets for  orchestra, concertos, trios, sonatas and variations for clavier, and,  in vocal music, a \"Salve Regina\" for soprano and alto, two violins and  organ. It would serve no useful purpose to deal with these works in  detail. The symphonies are, of course, the most important feature in the  list, but of these we shall speak generally when treating of Haydn as  the father of instrumental music. The first Symphony in C Major, usually  called \"Le Midi,\" is of special interest.    [Figure: a musical score excerpt]    The autograph score, dated 1761, and preserved at Eisenstadt, is  superscribed, \"In Nomine Domini,\" and closes with Haydn's customary  \"Laus Deo\" after the final signature The work is in the usual four  movements. The symphonies of this date included also those known in  England as \"Le Matin\" and \"Le Soir,\" the one beginning--    [Figure: a musical score excerpt] and the other--    [figure: a musical score excerpt]    Of the string quartets and other instrumental compositions of the period  nothing need be said. In all these the composer was simply feeling  his way towards a more perfect expression, and as few of them are now  performed, their interest for us is almost entirely antiquarian.        CHAPTER IV. ESTERHAZ--1766-1790    Haydn's Fame extending--Haydn and Mozart compared--Esterhaz--Its Puppet  Theatre--A Busy Life--Opera at Esterhaz--First Oratorio--Opponents and  Intriguers--\"L'Isola Disabitata\"--A Love Episode--Correspondence with  Artaria and Forster--Royal Dedicatees--The \"Seven Words\"--The \"Toy\" and  \"Farewell\" Symphonies.    To crowd the details of a professional career covering close upon a  quarter of a century into a single chapter would, in the case of most of  the great composers, be an altogether impossible task. In Haydn's case  the difficulty is to find the material for even so slight a record. His  life went on smoothly, almost sleepily, as we should now think, in the  service of his prince, without personal incident and with next to no  disturbance from the outside world. If he had not been a genius of the  first rank the outside world would, in all probability, never have heard  of his existence.    Haydn's Fame extending    As it was, his fame was now manifestly spreading. Thus the Wiener Diarum  for 1766 includes him among the most distinguished musicians of  Vienna, and describes him as \"the darling of our nation.\" His amiable  disposition, says the panegyrist, \"speaks through every one of his  works. His music has beauty, purity, and a delicate and noble simplicity  which commends it to every hearer. His cassations, quartets and trios  may be compared to a pure, clear stream of water, the surface now  rippled by a gentle breeze from the south, and anon breaking into  agitated billows, but without ever leaving its proper channel and  appointed course. His symphonies are full of force and delicate  sympathy. In his cantatas he shows himself at once captivating and  caressing, and in his minuets he is delightful and full of humour. In  short, Haydn is in music what Gellert is in poetry.\" This comparison  with Gellert, who died three years later, was at that date, as Dr Pohl  remarks, the most flattering that could well be made. The simplicity  and naturalness of Gellert's style were the very antithesis of the  pedantries and frigid formalities of the older school; and just as he  pioneered the way for the resuscitation of German poetry under Goethe  and Schiller, so Haydn may be said to have prepared the path for  Beethoven and the modern school.    Haydn and Mozart compared    Very likely it was this comparison of the magazine writer that suggested  Dittersdorf's remark to Joseph II in 1786, when the emperor requested  him to draw an analogy between Haydn's and Mozart's chamber music.
