[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2871"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication â€” Volume 1 (#9)"],[1,"dogs run wild on  Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean; \"they had entirely lost the faculty of  barking; they had no inclination for the company of other dogs, nor did  they acquire their voice\" during a captivity of several months. On the  island they \"congregate in vast packs, and catch sea-birds with as much  address as foxes could display.\" The feral dogs of La Plata have not become  dumb; they are of large size, hunt singly or in packs, and burrow holes for  their young. (1/35. Azara 'Voyages dans l'Amer. Merid.' tome 1 page 381;  his account is fully confirmed by Rengger. Quatrefages gives an account of  a bitch brought from Jerusalem to France which burrowed a hole and littered  in it. See 'Discours, Exposition des Races Canines' 1865 page 3.) In these  habits the feral dogs of La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of  which hunt either singly or in packs, and burrow holes. (1/36. With respect  to wolves burrowing holes see Richardson 'Fauna Boreali-Americana' page 64;  and Bechstein 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 1 s. 617.) These feral dogs  have not become uniform in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La  Plata. (1/37. See Poeppig 'Reise in Chile' b. 1 s. 290; Mr. G. Clarke, as  above; and Rengger, s. 155.) In Cuba the feral dogs are described by  Poeppig as nearly all mouse-coloured, with short ears and light-blue eyes.  In St. Domingo, Col. Ham. Smith says (1/38. Dogs, 'Nat. Library' volume 10  page 121; an endemic South American dog seems also to have become feral in  this island. See Gosse 'Jamaica' page 340.) that the feral dogs are very  large, like greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and  large light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently  naturalised in Australia, \"varies considerably in colour,\" as I am informed  by Mr. P.P. King: a half-bred Dingo reared in England (1/39. Low  'Domesticated Animals' page 650.) showed signs of wishing to burrow.    [From the several foregoing facts we see that reversion in the feral state  gives no indication of the colour or size of the aboriginal parent-species.  One fact, however, with respect to the colouring of domestic dogs, I at one  time hoped might have thrown some light on their origin; and it is worth  giving, as showing how colouring follows laws, even in so anciently and  thoroughly domesticated an animal as the dog. Black dogs with tan-coloured  feet, whatever breed they may belong to, almost invariably have a tan-  coloured spot on the upper and inner corners of each eye, and their lips  are generally thus coloured. I have seen only two exceptions to this rule,  namely, in a spaniel and terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a  lighter, yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white,  and in a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly examined for  me a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of them were black, or  black and white, or brindled, and these had no eye-spots; but three were  red and one slaty-blue, and these four had dark-coloured spots over their  eyes. Although the spots thus sometimes differ in colour, they strongly  tend to be tan-coloured; this is proved by my having seen four spaniels, a  setter, two Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel, and some fox-hounds,  coloured black and white, with not a trace of tan-colour, excepting the  spots over the eyes, and sometimes a little on the feet. These latter  cases, and many others, show plainly that the colour of the feet and the  eye-spots are in some way correlated. I have noticed, in various breeds,  every gradation, from the whole face being tan-coloured, to a complete ring  round the eyes, to a minute spot over the inner and upper corners. The  spots occur in various sub-breeds of terriers and spaniels; in setters; in  hounds of various kinds, including the turnspit-like German badger-hound;  in shepherd dogs; in a mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots; in  one pure bulldog, though the spots were in this case almost white; and in  greyhounds,--but true black-and-tan greyhounds are excessively rare;  nevertheless I have been assured by Mr. Warwick, that one ran at the  Caledonian Champion meeting of April 1860, and was \"marked precisely like a  black-and-tan terrier.\" This dog, or another exactly the same colour, ran  at the Scottish National Club on the 21st of March, 1865; and I hear from  Mr. C.M. Browne, that \"there was no reason either on the sire or dam side  for the appearance of this unusual colour.\" Mr. Swinhoe at my request  looked at the dogs in China, at Amoy, and he soon noticed a brown dog with  yellow spots over the eyes. Colonel H. Smith (1/40. 'The Naturalist  Library' Dogs, volume 10 pages 4, 19.) figures the magnificent black  mastiff of Thibet with a tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet, and  chaps; and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native domestic  dog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured rings round the  eyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May 1863, a so-called forest dog  from North-West Mexico was shown, which had pale tan-coloured spots over  the eyes. The occurrence of these tan-coloured spots in dogs of such  extremely different breeds, living in various parts of the world, makes the  fact highly remarkable.    We shall hereafter see, especially in the chapter on Pigeons, that coloured  marks are strongly inherited, and that they often aid us in discovering the  primitive forms of our domestic races. Hence, if any wild canine species  had distinctly exhibited the tan-coloured spots over the eyes, it might  have been argued that this was the parent-form of nearly all our domestic  races. But after looking at many coloured plates, and through the whole  collection of skins in the British Museum, I can find no species thus  marked. It is no doubt possible that some extinct species was thus  coloured. On the other hand, in looking at the various species, there seems  to be a tolerably plain correlation between tan-coloured legs and face; and  less frequently between black legs and a black face; and this general rule  of colouring explains to a certain extent the above-given cases of  correlation between the eye-spots and the colour of the feet. Moreover,  some jackals and foxes have a trace of a white ring round their eyes, as in  C. mesomelas, C. aureus, and (judging from Colonel H. Smith's drawing) in  C. alopex, and C. thaleb. Other species have a trace of a black line over  the corners of the eyes, as in C. variegatus, cinereo-variegatus, and  fulvus, and the wild Dingo. Hence I am inclined to conclude that a tendency  for tan-coloured spots to appear over the eyes in the various breeds of  dogs, is analogous to the case observed by Desmarest, namely, that when any  white appears on a dog the tip of the tail is always white, \"de maniere a  rappeler la tache terminale de meme couleur, qui caracterise la plupart des  Canides sauvages.\" (1/41. Quoted by Prof. Gervais 'Hist. Nat. Mamm.' tome 2  page 66.) This rule, however, as I am assured by Mr. Jesse, does not  invariably hold good.]    It has been objected that our domestic dogs cannot be descended from wolves  or jackals, because their periods of gestation are different. The supposed  difference rests on statements made by Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and  others; but these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to  agree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be expected, for it  is often in some degree variable. (1/42. J. Hunter shows that the long  period of seventy-three days given by Buffon is easily explained by the  bitch having received the dog many times during a period of sixteen days  ('Phil. Transact.' 1787 page 353). Hunter found that the gestation of a  mongrel from wolf and dog ('Phil. Transact.' 1789 page 160) apparently was  sixty-three days, for she received the dog more than once. The period of a  mongrel dog and jackal was fifty-nine days. Fred. Cuvier found the period  of gestation of the wolf to be ('Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tome 4 page 8)  two months and a few days, which agrees with the dog. Isid G. St.-Hilaire,  who has discussed the whole subject, and from whom I quote Bellingeri,  states ('Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 112) that in the Jardin des Plantes  the period of the jackal has been found to be from sixty to sixty-three  days, exactly as with the dog.) Tessier, who has closely attended to this  subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of the dog. The  Rev. W.D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded cases of retrievers, in  which the bitch was put only once to the dog; and not counting this day,  but counting that of parturition, the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two,  and sixty-seven days. The average period is sixty-three days; but  Bellingeri states that this applies only to large dogs; and that for small  races it is from sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had  much experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be  longer with large than with small dogs.    F. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not have been domesticated on  account of its offensive smell; but savages are not sensitive in this  respect. The degree of odour, also, differs in the different kinds of  jackal (1/43. See Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page  112, on the odour of jackals. Col. Ham. Smith in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page  289.); and Colonel H. Smith makes a sectional division of the group with  one character dependent on not being offensive. On the other hand, dogs--  for instance, rough and smooth terriers--differ much in this respect; and  M. Godron states that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more  odoriferous than other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy (1/44. Quoted by Quatrefages  in 'Bull. Soc. d'Acclimat.' May 11, 1863.) gave to a dog the same odour as  that from a jackal by feeding it on raw flesh.    The belief that our dogs "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28711"],[0,"Operas Every Child Should Know (#9)"],[1,"ss, and its summer dress he heard some person singing not far  away:    [Music:         The shepherd donned his best array,       Wreath and jacket and ribbons gay,       Oh, but he, but he was smart to see,       The circle closed round the linden tree,       All danced and sprang,       All danced and sprang, all danced and sprang;         like madmen danced away.       Hurrah, hurrah, huzza       Tra la, la, la, la.]    At first a single voice was singing, but soon the song was taken up by  a joyous chorus, and Faust, the scholar, stopped to listen.    Alas! It spoke of that gaiety he had so longed to enjoy. A group of  peasants were out for a holiday, and their sport was beginning early.  While he meditated on all that he had lost, the merrymakers drew near,  and he watched them dance, listened to them laugh and sing, and became  more and more heartsick. It was the youth of the revellers that  entered into his heart. There was he, so old, and nearly done with  life; done with its possibilities for joy and with its hardships!    Then, in the very midst of these thoughts the sound of martial music  was heard. Faust shaded his eyes with his trembling old hand:    \"Ha! A splendour of weapons is brightly gleaming afar: the sons of the  Danube apparelled for war! They gallop so proudly along: how sparkle  their eyes, how flash their shields. All hearts are thrilled, they  chant their battle's story! While my heart is cold, all unmoved by  glory.\" He sang this in recitative, while the music drew nearer and  nearer, and as the army passed by, it marched to one of the famous  compositions of history:    [Music]    Then the scene changed, and Faust was once more alone in his study. He  was melancholy.    \"I left the meadow without regret, and now, without delight, I greet  our haughty mountains. What is the use of such as I continuing to  live? There _is_ no use! I may as well kill myself and have done it.\"  And after thinking this over a moment in silence he prepared himself a  cup of poison, and lifted it to his lips. As he was about to drink and  end his woes, the choir from the chapel began to sing an Easter hymn.    \"Ah!\" he cried, \"the memories that overwhelm me! Oh, my weak and  trembling spirit, wilt thou surely ascend to heaven, borne upward by  this holy song!\" He began to think of his happy boyhood, of his early  home; then as the glorious music of the choir swelled higher and  higher, he became gentler and thought more tolerantly of life.    \"Those soft melodious strains bring peace to my soul; songs more sweet  than morning, I hear again! My tears spring forth, the earth has won  me back.\" He dropped his head upon his breast and wept. As he sat  thus, in tender mood, a strange happening took place. A queer,  explosive sound, and a jet of flame, and--there stood the devil, all  in red, forked tail, horns, and cloven hoof! He stood smiling wickedly  at the softened old man, while Faust stared at him wildly.    \"A most pious frame of mind, my friend. Give me your hand, dear Doctor  Faust. The glad Easter ringing of bells and singing of peans have  certainly charmed you back to earth!\"    \"Who art thou, whose glances are so fierce? They burn my very soul.  Speak, thou spectre, and tell me thy name.\" From his very appearance,  one could hardly doubt he was the Devil.    \"Why! so learned a man as you should know me. I am thy friend and  comfort. Come, ye are so melancholy, Doctor Faust, let me be thy  friend--I'll tell thee a secret: if you but say the word, I'll give ye  your dearest wish. It shall be whatever you wish. Eh? Shall it be  wealth, or fame?--what shall it be? Come! Let us talk it over.\"    \"That is well, wretched demon! I think I know ye now. I am interested  in ye. Sit, and we shall talk,\" the poor old Doctor replied, despising  that which nevertheless aroused his curiosity. He, like everybody  else, had heard of the Devil, but he doubted if any other had had the  fortune actually to see him.    \"Very well; I will be thine eye, thine ear. I will give thee the  world; thou shalt leave thy den, thy hateful study. Come! to satisfy  thy curiosity, follow me.\"    The old man regarded him thoughtfully for a moment, and then rose:    \"Let us go,\" he said, and in the twinkle of an eye they disappeared  into the air.    They were transported over hill and dale, village and fine city, till  the Devil paused at Leipzig.    \"Here is the place for us,\" he said; and instantly they descended to  the drinking cellar of Auerbach, a man who kept fine Rhenish wine for  jolly fellows.    They entered and sat at a table. By this time the Devil had changed  Faust the scholar, into a young and handsome man, youth being one of  Faust's dearest wishes.    All about them were coarse youths, soldiers, students, men off the  street, all drinking and singing gaily. Faust and the Devil ordered  wine and became a part of the company. They were all singing together  at that moment:         Oh, what delight when storm is crashing,       To sit all the night round the bowl;       High in the glass the liquor flashing,       While thick clouds of smoke float around.    The rest of the words were not very dignified nor fascinating, and  Faust looked on with some disgust. Presently some one cried out to a  half-drunken fellow named Brander to give them one of his famous  songs, and he got unsteadily upon his feet and began:         There was a rat in the cellar-nest         Whom fat and butter made smoother;       He had a paunch beneath his vest         Like that of Doctor Luther;       The cook laid poison cunningly,         And then as sore oppressed was he,       As if he had love in his bosom.         He ran around, he ran about,         His thirst in puddles laving;       He gnawed and scratched the house throughout,         But nothing cured his raving;       He whirled and jumped with torment mad,         And soon enough the poor beast had,       As if he had love in his bosom.         And driven at last, in open day,         He ran at last into the kitchen,       Fell on the hearth and squirming lay         In the last convulsion twitching;       Then laughed the murd'ress in her glee,         \"Ha, ha! He's at his last gasp,\" said she,       As if he had love in his bosom.    \"Requiescat in pace, amen!\" the Devil sang, and all joined on the  \"amen.\" \"Now then, permit _me_ to sing you a ballad,\" the Devil cried,  gaily, and he jumped upon his feet.    \"What, you pretend that you can do better than Brander?\" they  demanded, a little piqued.    \"Well, you see, I am expert at anything nasty and bad; so let us see:         There was a king once reigning,         Who had a big black flea,       And loved him past explaining,         As his own son were he.       He called his man of stitches,         The tailor came straightway,       'Here, measure the lad for breeches,         And measure his coat, I say.'         In silk and velvet gleaming,         He now was wholly drest,       Had a coat with ribbons streaming,         A cross upon his breast.       He had the first of stations,         A minister's star and name,       And also his relations,         Great lords at court became.         And lords and dames of honour         Were plagued awake and in bed.       The Queen, she got them upon her,         The maids were bitten and bled.       And they did not dare to brush them,         Or scratch them day or night.       We crack them and we crush them,         At once whene'er they bite.\"    \"Enough!\" said Faust; \"I want to leave this brutal company. There can  be no joys found where there is so much that is low and degrading. I  wish to go.\" And turning angrily to the Devil, he signified that he  would leave instantly.    \"Very well,\" said the Prince of Darkness, smiling his satirical smile.  \"Away we go--and better success with thee, next time.\" At which he  placed his mantle upon the ground, they stood upon it, and away they  flew into the air and disappeared.    When next they stopped, it was upon a grassy bank of the Elbe River.    \"Now, my friend; let us rest. Lie thou down upon the grassy bank and  close thine eyes, and dream of joys to come. When we awake we shall  wish again and see what new experience the world holds for us. Thus  far you do not seem too well satisfied.\"    \"I will sleep,\" Faust answered, reclining upon the bank. \"I should be  glad to forget some things that we have seen.\" So saying he slept. No  sooner had he done so, that the Devil summoned the most beautiful  sylphs to dance before him, and thus to influence Faust's dreams. They  began by softly calling his name. Then they lulled him to deeper  sleep, and his dream was of fair women. In his dream he saw the lovely  dance, the gracious forms, the heavenly voices of youthful women. The  Devil directed his dream-laden eyes toward a loving pair who walked  and spoke and loved apart. Then immediately behind those lovers  walked, meditatively, a beautiful maiden.    \"Behold,\" the Black Prince murmured to Faust; \"that maiden there who  follows: she shall be thy Marguerite. Shall it not be so?\" And Faust  sank back in his sleep, overcome with the lovely vision. Then the  Devil motioned the sylphs away.    \"Away, ye dainty elves, ye have served my turn to-day, and I shall not  forget.\" They danced to exquisite waltz music, hovering above Faust,  and gradually disappeared in the mists of the air.    Slowly Faust awakened; His first word was \"Marguerite!\" Then he looked  about him in a daze.    \"What a dream! What a dream!\" he murmured. \"I saw an angel in human  form.\"    \"Nay, she was a woman,\" said the Devil. \"Rise and follow me, and I  will show her to thee in her home. Hello! Here comes along a party of  jolly students and soldiers. They will pass her home. We'll move along  with them, join their shouts and songs, and presently we shall arrive  at her house.\" Faust, all trembling with the thought that at last he  had found that which was to make"]]]
