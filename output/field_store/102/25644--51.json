The contents are highly aromatic,  consisting of a brownish substance exceedingly sweet, and mixed with  small seeds resembling those inside a pear. There is a strong flavour of  medlar in this fruit, and it is much esteemed for medicinal properties,  especially in cases of diarrhoea. Although elephants refuse the Bael  fruit unless quite ripe, they will invariably arrive in great numbers  during the favourable season in the southern districts of Ceylon. The  question arises, \"How can an animal remember the month without an  almanack?\"    There is no doubt that animals possess in many instances a far greater  degree of reason than is generally admitted, with which the exercise of  memory is so closely allied that it is difficult to separate or define  the attributes. An elephant will remember those who have shown kindness,  perhaps for a longer period than it will others who may have offended.  After seven months' absence in England, an elephant that I had from the  Commissariat on my previous visit to India recognised me at once upon my  return. I had been in the habit of feeding this animal with sugar-canes  and other choice food almost daily during several months' companionship  in the jungle; this was not forgotten, and \"cupboard love\" was harboured  in its memory with the expectation that the feeding would be repeated.    In the same manner, but perhaps in a lesser degree, the elephant will  remember those whom it dislikes, and during the season of \"must\" it  would be exceedingly dangerous for such persons to venture within reach  of the animal's trunk. Stories are numerous concerning the animosity of  elephants against their mahouts or other attendants who have cruelly  treated them; but, on the other hand, the animals frequently exhibit a  wild ferocity towards those who have been innocent of harshness. As  characters vary among human beings, and some persons when intoxicated  become suddenly brutal, although when sober they have been mild in  reputation, so also we find conflicting natures among elephants, and the  insane excitement of the \"must\" period varies in intensity in different  animals.    There was a well-known elephant some years ago in the Balaghat district  of the Central Provinces which became historical through the  extraordinary malignity of its disposition. Having escaped from the  fetters, it killed the mahout, and at once made off towards the forests.  It is a curious example of nature that creatures (ferae naturae) have a  tendency to return to their original state of savagedom when the  opportunity is offered. If an elephant is seized with a panic when upon  open ground, it will rush for the nearest jungle, probably with the  intention of concealment. The animal in question returned to its wild  state directly it had escaped from confinement, but the domestication of  many years appears to have sharpened its intellect, and to have  exaggerated its powers for mischief and cunning. It became the scourge,  not only of the immediate neighbourhood, but of a considerable portion  of a district which included an area of a hundred miles in length by  forty or fifty in width.    No village was safe from the attack of this infuriated beast. It would  travel great distances, and appear at unexpected intervals, suddenly  presenting itself to the horrified villagers, who fled in all  directions, leaving their homes and their supplies of grain to be  demolished by the omnipotent intruder, who tore down their dwellings,  ransacked their stores of corn, and killed any unfortunate person who  came within its reach.    There was a cruel love of homicide in this animal that has rarely been  recorded. Not only would it attack villages in pursuit of forage, but it  was particularly addicted to the destruction of the lofty  watching-places in the fields, occupied nightly by the villagers to  scare wild animals from their crops. These watch-houses are generally  constructed upon strong poles secured by cross-pieces, on the top of  which, about sixteen feet from the ground, is a small hut upon a  platform. This is thatched to protect the occupant from the heavy dew or  rain. From such elevated posts the watchers yell and scream throughout  the night to frighten the wild beasts. To attack and tear down such  posts was the delight of this bloodthirsty elephant. Instead of being  scared by the shouts of the inmates, it was attracted by their cries,  and, unseen in the dark, it was upon them almost before they were aware  of its presence. The strong posts upon which the constructions had been  raised offered no resistance to the attack, and the miserable watchers  found themselves hurled to the ground together with the ruins of their  upturned shelter. In another moment they were either caught and stamped  to death, or chased through the darkness by the pursuing elephant, and  when captured they were torn limb from limb, as the brute exhibited a  cruel satisfaction in placing one foot upon the victim, and then tearing  with its trunk an arm, a leg, or the head from the mangled body.    In this manner the elephant killed upwards of twenty people throughout  the district, and it became absolutely necessary, if possible, to  destroy it.    This was at last effected by Colonel Bloomfield and a friend, who  determined at all hazards to hunt it down by following through the  jungles, guided by the reports of the natives, who were on the lookout  in all directions. The animal showed peculiar cunning, as it never  remained in the same place, but travelled a considerable distance  immediately after the committal of some atrocity, and concealed itself  within the jungles until prompted to another raid in some new direction.  I am indebted to Colonel Bloomfield for an interesting description of  the manner in which, after many days of great fatigue and patience, he  at length succeeded, with the assistance of native trackers, in  discovering this formidable opponent, asleep within a dense mass of  thorns and grass in the heart of an extensive jungle. The elephant awoke  before they could distinctly see its form, owing to the extreme  thickness of the covert, but the fight commenced. There was a  considerable difference between the attack upon defenceless villagers,  who fled before it in hopeless panic, and a stand-up fight with two  experienced European shikaris armed with the best rifles; the terror of  the district quickly showed its appreciation of discretion, and, badly  wounded, it retreated through the forest, well followed by the  determined hunters. Again and again it was overtaken, and a shot was  taken whenever the dense jungle afforded an opportunity. At length,  maddened by pursuit and wounds, it turned to charge, thereby exposing  itself in an open place, and both bullets crashed into its brain, the  shot from Colonel Bloomfield's rifle passing completely through its  head.    It would be impossible to determine whether such an elephant could have  been subdued and re-domesticated had its capture been effected. There  are many cases on record where a \"must\" elephant has committed grievous  depredations, after killing those who were its ordinary attendants, but  when re-captured, the temporary excitement has passed away, and the  animal has become as harmless as it was before the period of insanity.  Mr. G. P. Sanderson, the superintendent of the Government keddahs in  Assam, gives a vivid description of an elephant that escaped after  killing its mahout and several villagers in the neighbourhood. This  animal, like Colonel Bloomfield's elephant, already described, became  the terror of the district, and destroyed many villagers, until it was  decided by the authorities to attempt its destruction.    Mr. Sanderson was of opinion that it was too valuable to be heedlessly  sacrificed; he therefore determined to capture it alive, if possible,  through the aid of certain clever elephants belonging to the keddah  establishment.    The police of the district were ordered to obtain the necessary  information, and the malefactor was reported after a few days to have  destroyed another village, where it remained, devouring the rice and  grain in the absence of the panic-stricken villagers.    No time was lost in repairing to the spot with three highly-trained  elephants, two of which were females; the third was a well-known  fighting male, a tusker named Moota Gutche, who was usually employed to  dominate the obstreperous wild elephants when refractory in the keddah  enclosures. The necessary ropes and chains were prepared, and the small  but experienced party started, Mr. Sanderson being armed only with a  long spear, and riding on the pad, well girthed upon the back of Moota  Gutche.    A short hour's march brought them in sight of a ruined village on a  level plain, which skirted a dense forest. When within a quarter of a  mile, a large male elephant was discovered restlessly walking to and fro  as though keeping guard over the ruins he had made. This was the culprit  taken in the act.    Leaving the two females in the rear, with instructions to follow upon a  given signal, Mr. Sanderson on Moota Gutche advanced slowly to the  encounter. The rogue elephant did not appear to notice them until within  about 200 yards; it then suddenly halted, and turning round, it faced  them as though in astonishment at being disturbed. This attitude did not  last very long, as Moota Gutche still advanced until within ninety or a  hundred paces. The elephants now faced each other, and Moota Gutche  began to lower his head when he observed his antagonist backing a few  paces, which he well knew was the customary preparation for a charge.  \"Reculez pour mieux sauter\" was well exemplified when in another moment  the vagrant elephant dashed forward at great speed to the attack,  trumpeting and screaming with mad fury.

At 8.30 A.M. we got away with a spanking breeze.  The diahbiah horridly leaky. The \"tree,\" or rendezvous for all boats  when leaving for the White Nile voyage, consists of three large mimosas  about four miles from the point of junction. The Nile at this spot about  two miles wide--dead flat banks--mimosas on west bank. My two cabin  boys are very useful, and Osman's ringing laugh and constant  impertinence to the crew and soldiers keep the boat alive; he is a  capital boy, a perfect gamin, and being a tailor by trade he is very  useful: this accounts for his father wishing to detain him. The horses  and donkeys very snug on board. At 1 p.m. passed Gebel Ouli, a small  hill on south bank--course S.W. 1/2 S. At 8.30 p.m. reached Cetene, a  village of mixed Arabs on the east bank--anchored.    21st Dec.--All day busy clearing decks, caulking ship, and making room  for the camels on the noggurs, as this is the village to which I had  previously sent two men to select camels and to have them in readiness  for my arrival. The men have been selecting sweethearts instead; thus I  must wait here tomorrow, that being the \"Soog\" or market day, when I  shall purchase my camels and milch goats. The banks of the river very  uninteresting--flat, desert, and mimosa bush. The soil is not so rich  as on the banks of the Blue Nile--the dhurra (grain) is small. The Nile  is quite two miles wide up to this point, and the high-water mark is not  more than five feet above the present level. The banks shelve gradually  like the sands at low tide in England, and quite unlike the  perpendicular banks of the Blue Nile. Busy at gunsmith's work. The  nights and mornings are now cold, from 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Johann makes me very anxious: I much fear he cannot last long, unless  some sudden change for the better takes place.    22d Dec.--Selected two fine camels and shipped them in slings with some  difficulty. Bought four oxen at nine herias each (l5s.); the men  delighted at the work of slaughtering, and jerking the meat for the  voyage. Bought four milch goats at 9 ps. each, and laid in a large stock  of dhurra straw for the animals. Got all my men on board and sailed at  4.30 p.m., course due west; variation allowed for. I have already  reduced my men from wolves to lambs, and I should like to see the  outrageous acts of mutiny which are the scapegoats of the traders for  laying their atrocities upon the men's shoulders. I cannot agree with  some writers in believing that personal strength is unnecessary to a  traveller. In these savage countries it adds materially to the success  of an expedition, provided that it be combined with kindness of manner,  justice, and unflinching determination. Nothing impresses savages so  forcibly as the _power_ to punish and reward. I am not sure that this  theory is applicable to savages exclusively. Arrived at Wat Shely at 9  P.M. 23d Dec.--Poor Johann very ill. Bought two camels, and shipped them  all right: the market at this miserable village is as poor as that at  Getene. The river is about a mile and a half wide, fringed with mimosas;  country dead flat; soil very sandy; much cultivation near the village,  but the dhurra of poor quality. Saw many hippopotami in the river. I  much regret that I allowed Johann to accompany me from Khartoum; I feel  convinced he can never rally from his present condition.    24th Dec.--Sailed yesterday at 4.5 P.M., course south. This morning we  are off the Bagara country on the west bank. Dead flats of mimosas, many  of the trees growing in the water; the river generally shallow, and many  snags or dead stumps of trees. I have been fortunate with my men, only  one being drunk on leaving Wat Shely; him we carried forcibly on board.  Passed the island of Hassaniah at 2.20 P.M.; the usual flats covered  with mimosas. The high-water mark upon the stems of these trees is three  feet above the present level of the river; thus an immense extent of  country must be flooded during the wet season, as there are no banks to  the river. The water will retire in about two months, when the  neighbourhood of the river will be thronged with natives and their  flocks. All the natives of these parts are Arabs; the Bagara tribe on  the west bank. At Wat Shely some of the latter came on board to offer  their services as slave-hunters, this open offer confirming the general  custom of all vessels trading upon the White Nile.    25th Dec.--The Tokroori boy, Saat, is very amiable in calling all the  servants daily to eat together the residue from our table; but he being  so far civilized, is armed with a huge spoon, and having a mouth like a  crocodile, he obtains a fearful advantage over the rest of the party,  who eat the soup by dipping kisras (pancakes) into it with their  fingers. Meanwhile Saat sits among his invited guests, and works away  with his spoon like a sageer (water-wheel), and gets an unwarrantable  start, the soup disappearing like water in the desert. A dead calm the  greater portion of the day; the river fringed with mimosa forest. These  trees are the Soont (Acacia Arabica), which produce an excellent tannin:  the fruit, \"garra,\" is used for that purpose, and produces a rich brown  dye: all my clothes and the uniforms of my men I dyed at Khartoum with  this \"garra.\" The trees are about eighteen inches in diameter and  thirty-five feet high; being in full foliage, their appearance from a  distance is good, but on a closer approach the forest proves to be a  desolate swamp, completely overflowed; a mass of fallen dead trees  protruding from the stagnant waters, a solitary crane perched here and  there upon the rotten boughs; floating water-plants massed together, and  forming green swimming islands, hitched generally among the sunken  trunks and branches; sometimes slowly descending with the sluggish  stream, bearing, spectre-like, storks thus voyaging on nature's rafts  from lands unknown. It is a fever-stricken wilderness--the current not  exceeding a quarter of a mile per hour--the water coloured like an  English horse-pond; a heaven for mosquitoes and a damp hell for man.  Fortunately, this being the cold season, the winged plagues are absent.  The country beyond the inundated mimosa woods is of the usual sandy  character, with thorny Kittur bush. Saw a few antelopes. Stopped at a  horrible swamp to collect firewood. Anchored at night in a dead calm,  well out in the river to escape malaria from the swamped forest. This is  a precaution that the men would neglect, and my expedition might suffer  in consequence. Christmas Day!    26th Dec.--Good breeze at about 3 A.M.; made sail. I have never seen a  fog in this part of Africa; although the neighbourhood of the river is  swampy, the air is clear both in the morning and evening. Floating  islands of water-plants are now very numerous. There is a plant  something like a small cabbage (Pistia Stratiotes, L.), which floats  alone until it meets a comrade; these unite, and recruiting as they  float onward, they eventually form masses of many thousands, entangling  with other species of water-plants and floating wood, until they at  length form floating islands. Saw many hippopotami; the small hill in  the Dinka country seen from the masthead at 9.15 A.M.; breeze light, but  steady; the banks of the river, high grass and mimosas, but not forest  as formerly. Water lilies in full bloom, white, but larger than the  European variety. In the evening the crew and soldiers singing and  drumming.    27th Dec.--Blowing hard all night. Passed the Dinka hill at 3.30 A.M.  Obliged to take in sail, as it buried the head of the vessel and we  shipped much water. Staggering along under bare poles at about five  miles an hour. The true banks of the river are about five hundred yards  distant from the actual stream, this space being a mass of floating  water-plants, decayed vegetable matter, and a high reedy grass much  resembling sugarcanes; the latter excellent food for my animals. Many  very interesting water-plants and large quantities of Ambatch wood  (Anemone mirabilis)--this wood, of less specific gravity than cork, is  generally used for rafts; at this season it is in full bloom, its bright  yellow blossoms enlivening the dismal swamps. Secured very fine  specimens of a variety of helix from the floating islands. In this spot  the river is from 1500 yards to a mile wide; the country, flat and  uninteresting, being the usual scattered thorn bushes and arid plains,  the only actual timber being confined to the borders of the river.  Course, always south with few turns. My sponging-bath makes a good  pinnace for going ashore from the vessel. At 4.20 P.M. one of the  noggurs carried away her yard--the same boat that met with the accident  at our departure; hove to, and closed with the bank for repairs. Here is  an affair of delay; worked with my own hands until 9 p.m.; spliced the  yard, bound it with rhinoceros thongs, and secured the whole splice with  raw bull's hide. Posted sentries--two on each boat, and two on shore.    28th Dec.--At work at break of day. Completed the repair of yard, which  is disgracefully faulty. Re-rigged the mast. Poor Johann will die, I  much fear. His constitution appears to be quite broken up; he has become  deaf, and there is every symptom of decay. I have done all I can for  him, but his voyage in this life is nearly over. Ship in order, and all  sailed together at 2:15 p.m. Strong north wind. Two vessels from  Khartoum passed us while repairing damages. I rearranged the donkeys,  dividing them into stalls containing three each, as they were such  donkeys that they crowded each other unnecessarily. Caught a curious  fish (Tetrodon"]]]
