The     schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n;     that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered /kit'n/ and /kuhl'r/,     not /kit'*n/ and /kuhl'*r/.       Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in     standard American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV     network announcers and typical of educated speech in the Upper     Midwest, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Philadelphia). However, we     separate /o/ from /ah/, which tend to merge in standard American. This     may help readers accustomed to accents resembling British Received     Pronunciation.       The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to     map the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some     subset of the distinctions we make. Speakers of British RP, for     example, can smash terminal /r/ and all unstressed vowels. Speakers of     many varieties of southern American will automatically map /o/ to     /aw/; and so forth. (Standard American makes a good reference dialect     for this purpose because it has crisp consonants and more vowel     distinctions than other major dialects, and tends to retain     distinctions between unstressed vowels. It also happens to be what     your editor speaks.)       Entries with a pronunciation of `//' are written-only usages. (No,     Unix weenies, this does not mean `pronounce like previous     pronunciation'!)       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Other Lexicon Conventions, Next:[162]Format for New Entries,     Previous:[163]Pronunciation Guide, Up:[164]Top    Other Lexicon Conventions       Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than     the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in     mainstream dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with     nonalphabetic characters are sorted after Z. The case-blindness is a     feature, not a bug.       The beginning of each entry is marked by a colon (:) at the left     margin. This convention helps out tools like hypertext browsers that     benefit from knowing where entry boundaries are, but aren't as     context-sensitive as humans.       In pure ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see {} used to     bracket words which themselves have entries in the File. This isn't     done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that     a reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon meaning and one     might wish to refer to its entry.       In this all-ASCII version, headwords for topic entries are     distinguished from those for ordinary entries by being followed by     \"::\" rather than \":\"; similarly, references are surrounded by \"{{\" and     \"}}\" rather than \"{\" and \"}\".       Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in `slanted type'. A     defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an     explanation of it.       Prefixed ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect     usage.       We follow the `logical' quoting convention described in the Writing     Style section above. In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual     excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech. Scare quotes (which     mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes     (which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name     it) are both rendered with single quotes.       References such as malloc(3) and patch(1) are to Unix facilities (some     of which, such as patch(1), are actually freeware distributed over     Usenet). The Unix manuals use foo(n) to refer to item foo in section     (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls, n=3 is     C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where present) is system     administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals have     changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to in any of     the entries.       Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized     here:       abbrev.            abbreviation       adj.            adjective       adv.            adverb       alt.            alternate       cav.            caveat       conj.            conjunction       esp.            especially       excl.            exclamation       imp.            imperative       interj.            interjection       n.            noun       obs.            obsolete       pl.            plural       poss.            possibly       pref.            prefix       prob.            probably       prov.            proverbial       quant.            quantifier       suff.            suffix       syn.            synonym (or synonymous with)       v.            verb (may be transitive or intransitive)       var.            variant       vi.            intransitive verb       vt.            transitive verb       Where alternate spellings or pronunciations are given, alt. separates     two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while var. prefixes     one that is markedly less common than the primary.       Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known     to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate.

The fact that a term is labelled     with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use     is confined to that culture. In particular, many terms labelled `MIT'     and `Stanford' are in quite general use. We have tried to give some     indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes;     however, a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to     make these indications less definite than might be desirable.       A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed]. These     are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet respondents     in the process of commenting on previous definitions of those entries.     These are not represented as established jargon.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Format for New Entries, Next:[169]The Jargon Lexicon,     Previous:[170]Other Lexicon Conventions, Up:[171]Top    Format For New Entries       You can mail submissions for the Jargon File to     [172]jargon@snark.thyrsus.com.

PISTHETAERUS And I'll smash your urns.(1)      f(1) Which the inspector had brought with him for the purpose of  inaugurating the assemblies of the people or some tribunal.    INSPECTOR Do you recall that evening when you stooled against the column  where the decrees are posted?    PISTHETAERUS Here! here! let him be seized. (THE INSPECTOR RUNS OFF.)  Well! don't you want to stop any longer?    PRIEST Let us get indoors as quick as possible; we will sacrifice the  goat inside.(1)      f(1) So that the sacrifices might no longer be interrupted.    CHORUS Henceforth it is to me that mortals must address their sacrifices  and their prayers. Nothing escapes my sight nor my might. My glance  embraces the universe, I preserve the fruit in the flower by destroying  the thousand kinds of voracious insects the soil produces, which attack  the trees and feed on the germ when it has scarcely formed in the calyx;  I destroy those who ravage the balmy terrace gardens like a deadly  plague; all these gnawing crawling creatures perish beneath the lash of  my wing. I hear it proclaimed everywhere: \"A talent for him who shall  kill Diagoras of Melos,(1) and a talent for him who destroys one of the  dead tyrants.\"(2) We likewise wish to make our proclamation: \"A talent  to him among you who shall kill Philocrates, the Struthian;(3) four,  if he brings him to us alive. For this Philocrates skewers the finches  together and sells them at the rate of an obolus for seven. He tortures  the thrushes by blowing them out, so that they may look bigger, sticks  their own feathers into the nostrils of blackbirds, and collects  pigeons, which he shuts up and forces them, fastened in a net, to decoy  others.\" That is what we wish to proclaim. And if anyone is keeping  birds shut up in his yard, let him hasten to let them loose; those who  disobey shall be seized by the birds and we shall put them in chains, so  that in their turn they may decoy other men.    Happy indeed is the race of winged birds who need no cloak in winter!  Neither do I fear the relentless rays of the fiery dog-days; when the  divine grasshopper, intoxicated with the sunlight, when noon is burning  the ground, is breaking out into shrill melody; my home is beneath the  foliage in the flowery meadows. I winter in deep caverns, where I frolic  with the mountain nymphs, while in spring I despoil the gardens of the  Graces and gather the white, virgin berry on the myrtle bushes.    I want now to speak to the judges about the prize they are going to  award; if they are favourable to us, we will load them with benefits far  greater than those Paris(4) received. Firstly, the owls of Laurium,(5)  which every judge desires above all things, shall never be wanting to  you; you shall see them homing with you, building their nests in your  money-bags and laying coins. Besides, you shall be housed like the  gods, for we shall erect gables(6) over your dwellings; if you hold  some public post and want to do a little pilfering, we will give you the  sharp claws of a hawk. Are you dining in town, we will provide you with  crops.(7) But, if your award is against us, don't fail to have metal  covers fashioned for yourselves, like those they place over statues;(8)  else, look out! for the day you wear a white tunic all the birds will  soil it with their droppings.      f(1) A disciple of Democrites; he passed over from superstition to  atheism. The injustice and perversity of mankind led him to deny the  existence of the gods, to lay bare the mysteries and to break the  idols. The Athenians had put a price on his head, so he left Greece and  perished soon afterwards in a storm at sea.    f(2) By this jest Aristophanes means to imply that tyranny is dead, and  that no one aspires to despotic power, though this silly accusation was  constantly being raised by the demagogues and always favourably received  by the populace.    f(3) A poulterer.--Strouthian, used in joke to designate him, as if from  the name of his 'deme,' is derived from (the Greek for) 'a sparrow.' The  birds' foe is thus grotesquely furnished with an ornithological surname.    f(4) From Aphrodite (Venus), to whom he had awarded the apple, prize of  beauty, in the contest of the \"goddesses three.\"    f(5) Laurium was an Athenian deme at the extremity of the Attic  peninsula containing valuable silver mines, the revenues of which were  largely employed in the maintenance of the fleet and payment of the  crews. The \"owls of Laurium,\" of course, mean pieces of money; the  Athenian coinage was stamped with a representation of an owl, the bird  of Athene.    f(6) A pun, impossible to keep in English, on the two meanings of (the  Greek) word which signifies both an eagle and the gable of a house or  pediment of a temple.    f(7) That is, birds' crops, into which they could stow away plenty of  good things.    f(8) The Ancients appear to have placed metal discs over statues  standing in the open air, to save them from injury from the weather,  etc.    PISTHETAERUS Birds! the sacrifice is propitious. But I see no messenger  coming from the wall to tell us what is happening. Ah! here comes one  running himself out of breath as though he were running the Olympic  stadium.    MESSENGER Where, where is he? Where, where, where is he? Where, where,  where is he? Where is Pisthetaerus, our leader?    PISTHETAERUS Here am I.    MESSENGER The wall is finished.    PISTHETAERUS That's good news.    MESSENGER 'Tis a most beautiful, a most magnificent work of art. The  wall is so broad that Proxenides, the Braggartian, and Theogenes could  pass each other in their chariots, even if they were drawn by steeds as  big as the Trojan horse.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis wonderful!    MESSENGER Its length is one hundred stadia; I measured it myself.    PISTHETAERUS A decent length, by Posidon! And who built such a wall?    MESSENGER Birds--birds only; they had neither Egyptian brickmaker, nor  stone-mason, nor carpenter; the birds did it all themselves; I could  hardly believe my eyes. Thirty thousand cranes came from Libya with  a supply of stones,(1) intended for the foundations. The water-rails  chiselled them with their beaks. Ten thousand storks were busy making  bricks; plovers and other water fowl carried water into the air.      f(1) So as not to be carried away by the wind when crossing the sea,  cranes are popularly supposed to ballast themselves with stones, which  they carry in their beaks.    PISTHETAERUS And who carried the mortar?    MESSENGER Herons, in hods.    PISTHETAERUS But how could they put the mortar into hods?    MESSENGER Oh! 'twas a truly clever invention; the geese used their feet  like spades; they buried them in the pile of mortar and then emptied  them into the hods.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! to what use cannot feet be put?(1)      f(1) Pisthetaerus modifies the Greek proverbial saying, \"To what use  cannot hands be put?\"    MESSENGER You should have seen how eagerly the ducks carried bricks.  To complete the tale, the swallows came flying to the work, their beaks  full of mortar and their trowel on their back, just the way little  children are carried.    PISTHETAERUS Who would want paid servants after this? But tell me, who  did the woodwork?    MESSENGER Birds again, and clever carpenters too, the pelicans, for they  squared up the gates with their beaks in such a fashion that one would  have thought they were using axes; the noise was just like a dockyard.  Now the whole wall is tight everywhere, securely bolted and well  guarded; it is patrolled, bell in hand; the sentinels stand everywhere  and beacons burn on the towers. But I must run off to clean myself; the  rest is your business.    CHORUS Well! what do you say to it? Are you not astonished at the wall  being completed so quickly?    PISTHETAERUS By the gods, yes, and with good reason. 'Tis really not to  be believed. But here comes another messenger from the wall to bring us  some further news! What a fighting look he has!    SECOND MESSENGER Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh!    PISTHETAERUS What's the matter?    SECOND MESSENGER A horrible outrage has occurred; a god sent by Zeus  has passed through our gates and has penetrated the realms of the air  without the knowledge of the jays, who are on guard in the daytime.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis an unworthy and criminal deed. What god was it?    SECOND MESSENGER We don't know that. All we know is, that he has got  wings.    PISTHETAERUS Why were not guards sent against him at once?    SECOND MESSENGER We have d(i)spatched thirty thousand hawks of the  legion of Mounted Archers.(1) All the hook-clawed birds are moving  against him, the kestrel, the buzzard, the vulture, the great-horned  owl; they cleave the air, so that it resounds with the flapping of their  wings; they are looking everywhere for the god, who cannot be far away;  indeed, if I mistake not, he is coming from yonder side.      f(1) A corps of Athenian cavalry was so named.    PISTHETAERUS All arm themselves with slings and bows! This way, all our  soldiers; shoot and strike! Some one give me a sling!    CHORUS War, a terrible war is breaking out between us and the gods!  Come, let each one guard Air, the son of Erebus,(1) in which the clouds  float. Take care no immortal enters it without your knowledge. Scan  all sides with your glance. Hark! methinks I can hear the rustle of the  swift wings of a god from heaven.      f(1) Chaos, Night, Tartarus, and Erebus alone existed in the beginning;  Eros was born from Night and Erebus, and he wedded Chaos and begot  Earth, Air, and Heaven; so runs the fable.    PISTHETAERUS Hi! you woman! where are you flying to? Halt, don't stir!  keep motionless! not a beat of your wing!--Who are you and from what  country? You must say whence you come.(1)      f(1) Iris appears from the top of the stage and arrests her flight in  mid-career.    IRIS I come from the abode of the Olympian gods."]]]
