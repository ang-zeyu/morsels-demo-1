You have a young man's warm blood in your veins. You have the poison of  youth in your blood. You are a man's man, Peter Gross, but you are also  a woman's man.\"    Peter Gross's puzzled frown became a look of blank amazement. \"What in  the devil are you driving at, Sachsen?\" he demanded, forgetting in his  astonishment that he was in the governor's presence.    Sachsen leaned forward, his eyes searching his protege's.    \"Have you ever loved a woman, Pieter?\" he countered softly.    Peter Gross appeared to be choking. The veins in his forehead distended.    \"What has that to do with Bulungan?\" he demanded. \"You've known me since  I was a lad, Sachsen; you've known all my comings and goings; why do you  ask me such--rot?\"    A grimly humorous smile lit the governor's stern visage.    \"'Let the strong take heed lest they fall,'\" Sachsen quoted quietly.  \"Since you say that you love no woman, let me ask you this--have you  ever seen Koyala?\"    The little flash of passion left Peter Gross's face, but the puzzled  frown remained.    \"Koyala,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"It seems to me I have heard the  name, but I cannot recall how or when.\"    \"Think, think!\" Sachsen urged, leaning eagerly over the table. \"The  half-white woman of Borneo, the French trader's daughter by a native  woman, brought up and educated at a mission school in Sarawak. The Dyaks  call her the _Bintang Burung_. Ha! I see you know her now.\"    \"Leveque's daughter, Chawatangi's grandchild?\" Peter Gross exclaimed. \"Of  course I know her. Who doesn't?\" His face sobered. \"The unhappiest woman  in the archipelago. I wonder she lives.\"    \"You have seen her?\" Sachsen asked.    Peter Gross's eyes twinkled reminiscently. \"Ay, that I have.\"    \"Tell me about it,\" Sachsen urged, with an imperceptible gesture to the  governor to say nothing. He leaned forward expectantly.    Peter Gross cocked an eye at the ceiling. \"Let me see, it was about a  year ago,\" he said. \"I was with McCloud, on the brig _Mary Dietrich_.  McCloud heard at Macassar that there was a settlement of Dyaks at the  mouth of the Abbas that wanted to trade in dammar gum and gambir and  didn't ask too much _balas_ (tribute money). We crossed the straits and  found the village. Wolang, the chief, gave us a big welcome. We spent  one day palavering; these natives won't do anything without having a  _bitchara_ first. The next morning I began loading operations, while  McCloud entertained the _orang kaya_, Wolang, with a bottle of gin.    \"The natives crowded around pretty close, particularly the women,  anxious to see what we were bringing ashore. One girl, quite a pretty  girl, went so far as to step into the boat, and one of my men swung an  arm around her and kissed her. She screamed.\"    The governor took his pipe out of his mouth and looked up with interest.    \"The next minute the mob of Dyaks parted as though cut with a scythe.  Down the lane came a woman, a white woman.\"    He turned to the secretary. \"You have seen her, Sachsen?\"    \"_Ja_, Pieter.\"    \"Then you can guess how she keeled me over,\" Peter Gross said. \"I took  her for white woman, a pure blood. She is white; the brown in her skin  is no deeper than in a Spaniard's. She walked up to me--I could see a  hurricane was threatening--and she said:    \"'You are English? Go back to your ship, now; don't wait a minute, or  you will leave your heads here.'    \"'Madam,' I said, 'the lad was hasty, but meant no harm. It will not  happen again. I will make the lady a present.'    \"She turned a look on me that fairly withered me. '_You_ think you can  buy our women, too?' she said, fairly spitting the words. 'Go! go! Don't  you see my Dyaks fitting arrows in their blow-pipes?'    \"McCloud came running up with Chief Wolang. 'What's this?' he blustered,  but Koyala only pointed to the sea and said the one word:    \"'Go!'    \"McCloud spoke to Wolang, but at a nod from Koyala the chief gave an  order to his followers. Fifty Dyaks fitted poisoned arrows into their  _sumpitans_. McCloud had good judgment; he knew when it was no use to  _bitchara_ and show gin. We rowed back to the ship without the cargo we  expected to load and set sail at once. Not an arrow followed us, but the  last thing I saw of the village was Koyala on the beach, watching us dip  into the big rollers of the Celebes Sea.\"    \"She is beautiful?\" Sachsen suggested softly.    \"Ay, quite an attractive young female,\" Peter Gross agreed in utmost  seriousness. The governor's grim smile threatened to break out into an  open grin.    Sachsen looked at the table-top thoughtfully and rubbed his hands. \"She  lost you a cargo,\" he stated. \"You have a score to settle with her.\" He  flashed a keen glance at his protege.    \"By God, no!\" Peter Gross exclaimed. He brought his fist down on the  table. \"She was right, eternally right. If a scoundrelly scum from over  the sea tried to kiss a woman of my kin in that way I'd treat him a lot  worse than we were treated.\"    Van Schouten blew an angry snort that cut like a knife the huge cloud of  tobacco-smoke in which he had enveloped himself. Peter Gross faced him  truculently.    \"We deserved what we got,\" he asserted. \"When we whites get over the  notion that the world is a playground for us to spill our lusts and  vices on and the lower races the playthings we can abuse as we please,  we'll have peace in these islands. Our missionaries preach morals and  Christianity; our traders, like that damned whelp, Leveque, break every  law of God and man. Between the two the poor benighted heathen loses all  the faith he has and sinks one grade lower in brutishness than his  ancestors were before him. If all men were like Brooke of Sarawak we'd  have had the East Indies Christianized by now. The natives were ready to  make gods out of us--they did it with Brooke--but now they're looking  for a chance to put a knife in our backs--a good many of them are.\"    He checked himself. \"Here I'm preaching. I beg your pardon, your  excellency.\"    Van Schouten blew another great cloud of tobacco-smoke and said nothing.  Through the haze his eagle-keen eyes searched Peter Gross's face and  noted the firm chin and tightly drawn lips with stern disapproval.  Sachsen flashed him a warning glance to keep silent.    \"Mynheer Gross,\" the secretary entreated, \"let me again beg the  privileges of an old friend. Is it admiration for Koyala's beauty or  your keen sense of justice that leads you to so warm a defense?\"    Peter Gross's reply was prompt and decisive.    \"Vrind Sachsen, if she had been a hag I'd have thought no different.\"    \"Search your heart, Vrind Pieter. Is it not because she was young and  comely, a woman unafraid, that you remember her?\"    \"Women are nothing to me,\" Peter Gross retorted irritably. \"But right  is right, and wrong is wrong, whether in Batavia or Bulungan.\"    Sachsen shook his head.    \"Vrind Pieter,\" he declared sadly, \"you make me very much afraid for  you. If you had acknowledged, 'The woman was fair, a fair woman stirs me  quickly,' I would have said: 'He is young and has eyes to see with, but  he is too shrewd to be trapped.' But when you say: 'The fault was ours,  we deserved to lose the cargo,' then I know that you are blind, blind to  your own weakness, Pieter. Clever, wicked women make fools of such as  you, Pieter.\"    One eyebrow arched the merest trifle in the direction of the governor.  Then Sachsen continued:    \"Vrind Pieter, I am here to-night to warn you against this woman. I have  much to tell you about her, much that is unpleasant. Will you listen?\"    Peter Gross shrugged his shoulders.    \"I am at your service, Sachsen.\"    \"Will you listen with an open mind? Will you banish from your thoughts  all recollection of the woman you saw at the mouth of the Abbas River,  all that you know or think you know of her fancied wrongs, and hear what  old Sachsen has to say of the evil she has done, of the crimes, the  piracies, ay, even rebellions and treasons for which she has been  responsible? What do you say, Vrind Pieter?\"    Pieter Gross swallowed hard. Words seemed to be struggling to his lips,  but he kept them back. His teeth were pressed together tightly, the  silence became tense.    \"Listen, Sachsen,\" he finally said. His voice was studiedly calm. \"You  come from an old, conservative race, a race that clings faithfully to  the precepts and ideals of its fathers and is certain of its footing  before it makes a step in advance. You have the old concept of woman,  that her lot is to bear, to suffer, and to weep. I come from a fresher,  newer race, a race that gives its women the same liberty of thought and  action that it gives its men. Therefore there are many things concerning  the conduct of this woman that we look at in different ways. Things that  seem improper, ay, sometimes treasonable, to you, seem a perfectly  natural protest to me. You ignore the wrongs she has suffered, wrongs  that must make life a living hell to her. You say she must be content  with the place to which God has called her, submerge the white blood in  her, and live a savage among savages.\"    Peter Gross pulled his chair nearer the table and leaned forward. His  face glowed with an intense earnestness.    \"Great Scot, Sachsen, think of her condition! Half white, ay, half  French, and that is as proud a race as breathes. Beautiful--beautiful as  the sunrise. Taught in a missionary school, brought up as a white child  among white children. And then, when the glory of her womanhood comes  upon her, to learn she is an illegitimate, a half-breed, sister to the  savage Dyaks, her only future in their filthy huts, to kennel with them,  breed with them--God, what a horror that revelation must have been!\"    He raked his fingers through his hair and stared savagely at the wall.    \"You don't feel these things, Sachsen,\" he concluded. \"You're Dutch to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#9)"],[1,"oice, and  his body trembled violently. Then he would tell what he had seen  in his vision.    After a time the number of his followers began to increase. People  came from distant parts of Arabia and from neighboring countries  to hear him. One day six of the chief men of Me-di'na, one of the  largest cities of Arabia, listened earnestly to his preaching and  were converted. When they returned home they talked of the new  religion to their fellow-citizens, and a great many of them became  believers.    [Illustration: MOHAMMED PREACHING TO HIS FOLLOWER IN THE DESERT]    But the people of Mecca, Mohammed's own home, were nearly all opposed  to him. They would not believe what he preached, and they called him  an impostor. The people of the tribe to which he himself belonged  were the most bitter against him. They even threatened to put him  to death as an enemy of the gods.    About this time Mohammed's uncle and wife died, and he had then  hardly any friends in Mecca. He therefore resolved to leave that  city and go to Medina. Numbers of the people there believed his  doctrines and wished him to come and live among them. So he secretly  left his native town and fled from his enemies. With a few faithful  companions he made his escape to Medina.    It was in the year of our Lord 622 that Mohammed fled from Mecca.  This event is very important in Mohammedan history. It is called  \"the flight of the prophet,\" or \"the Hej'i-ra,\" a word which means  _flight_. The Hejira is the beginning of the Mohammedan era; and  so in all countries where the rulers and people are Mohammedans,  the years are counted from the Hejira instead of from the birth  of Christ.    [Illustration: THE MOSQUE OF AHMEDIEH AND THE OBELISK AT CONSTANTINOPLE]    On his arrival in Medina the people received Mohammed with great  rejoicing. He lived there the remainder of his life. A splendid  church was built for him in Medina. It was called a mosque, and  all Mohammedan churches, or places of worship, are called by this  name. It means a place for prostration or prayer.    [Illustration: MOHAMMED ENTERING MECCA, PREACHING THE UNITY OF GOD]    IV    Mohammed thought that it was right to spread his religion by force,  and to make war on \"unbelievers\", as he called all people who did  not accept his teaching. He therefore got together an army and fought  battles and unbelievers. He gained many victories. He marched against  Mecca with an army of ten thousand men, and the city surrendered  with little resistance. The people then joined his religion and  destroyed their idols. Before very long all the inhabitants of  Arabia and many of the people of the neighboring countries became  Mohammedans.    Mohammed died in Medina in the year of our Lord 632, or year 11  of the Hejira. He was buried in the mosque in which he had held  religious services for so many years; and Medina has ever since  been honored, because it contains the tomb of the Prophet. It is  believed by his followers that the body still lies in the coffin  in the same state as when it was first buried. There is also a  story that the coffin of Mohammed rests somewhere between heaven  and earth, suspended in the air. But this fable was invented by  enemies to bring ridicule on the prophet and his religion.    The tomb of Mohammed is visited every year by people from all Mohammedan  countries. Mecca, the birthplace of the prophet, is also visited by  vast numbers of pilgrims. Every Mussulman is bound by his religion  to make a visit or pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his life.  Whenever a Mussulman prays, no matter in what part of the world  he may be, he turns his face towards Mecca, as if he were always  thinking of going there.    [Illustration: PILGRIMS MARCHING THROUGH THE DESERT TO MECCA]    Good Mohammedans pray five times every day, and there is a church  officer called a mu-ez'zin, who gives them notice of the hour for  prayer. This he does by going on the platform, or balcony, of the  minaret, or tower, of the mosque and chanting in a loud voice such  words as these:    \"Come to prayer, come to prayer. There is no god but God. He giveth  life, and he dieth not. I praise his perfection. God is great.\"    In Mecca there is a mosque called the Great Mosque. It is a large  enclosure in the form of a quadrangle, or square, which can hold  35,000 persons. It is enclosed by arcades with pillars of marble  and granite, and has nineteen gates, each with a minaret or pointed  tower above it.    [Illustration: A MUEZZIN CALLING TO PRAYER]    Within this enclosure is a famous building called the \"Ka'a-ba,\"  or cube. It is nearly a cube in shape. It its wall, at one corner,  is the celebrated \"Black Stone.\" Moslems regard this stone with  the greatest reverence. They say that it came down from heaven.  It is said to have been once white, but has become dark from being  wept upon and touched by so many millions of pilgrims. It really  is reddish-brown in color.    Before the time of Mohammed the Ka'a-ba was a pagan temple; but  when he took possession of Mecca he made the old temple the centre  of worship for his own religion.    After Mohammed died a person was appointed to be his successor as  head of the Moslem church. He was called the caliph, a word which  means _successor_; and this title has been borne ever since by the  religious chief of the Mohammedans. In modern times the sultans or  rulers of Turkey have been commonly regarded as the caliphs. Arab  scholars, however, say that really the she-rif, _i.e._, the governor  of Mecca, is entitled by the Koran to hold this position.          CHARLES MARTEL, 714-741 A.D.    AND    PEPIN, 741-768 A.D.    I    After the death of Mohammed the Saracens, as Mohammedans are also  called, became great warriors. They conquered many countries and  established the Mohammedan religion in them. In 711 the Saracens  invaded and conquered a great part of Spain and founded a powerful  kingdom there, which lasted about seven hundred years.    They intended to conquer the land of the Franks next, and then all  Europe.    They thought it would be easy to conquer the Franks, because the  Frankish king at that time was a very weak man. He was one of a  number of kings who were called the \"Do-nothings.\" They reigned  from about 638 to 751. They spent all their time in amusements  and pleasures, leaving the affairs of the government to be managed  by persons called _mayors of the palace_.    The mayors of the palace were officers who at first managed the  king's household. Afterwards they were made guardians of kings  who came to the throne when very young. So long as the king was  under age the mayor of the palace acted as chief officer of the  government in his name. And as several of the young kings, even  when they were old enough to rule, gave less attention to business  than to pleasure, the mayors continued to do all the business,  until at last they did everything that the king ought to have done.  They made war, led armies in battle, raised money and spent it,  and carried on the government as they pleased, without consulting  the king.    The \"Do-nothings\" had the title of king, but nothing more. In fact,  they did not desire to have any business to do. The things they  cared for were dogs, horses and sport.    One of the most famous of the mayors was a man named Pep'in. Once  a year, it is said, Pepin had the king dressed in his finest clothes  and paraded through the city of Paris, where the court was held.  A splendid throng of nobles and courtiers accompanied the king,  and did him honor as he went along the streets in a gilded chariot  drawn by a long line of beautiful horses. The king was cheered by  the people, and he acknowledged their greetings most graciously.    After the parade the king was escorted to the great hall of the  palace, which was filled with nobles. Seated on a magnificent throne,  he saluted the assemblage and made a short speech. The speech was  prepared beforehand by Pepin, and committed to memory by the king.  At the close of the ceremony the royal \"nobody\" retired to his  country house and was not heard of again for a year.    II    Pepin died in 714 A.D., and his son Charles, who was twenty-five  years old at that time, succeeded him as mayor of the palace. This  Charles is known in history as Charles Martel. He was a brave young  man. He had fought in many of his father's battles and so had become  a skilled soldier. His men were devoted to him.    While he was mayor of the palace he led armies in several wars  against the enemies of the Franks. The most important of his wars  was one with the Saracens, who came across the Pyrenees from Spain and  invaded the land of the Franks, intending to establish Mohammedanism  there. Their army was led by Abd-er-Rah'man, the Saracen governor  of Spain.    [Illustration: CHARLES MARTEL AT TOURS]    On his march through the southern districts of the land of the  Franks Abd-er-Rahman destroyed many towns and villages, killed a  number of the people, and seized all the property he could carry  off. He plundered the city of Bordeaux (_bor-do'_), and, it is  said, obtained so many valuable things that every soldier \"was  loaded with golden vases and cups and emeralds and other precious  stones.\"    But meanwhile Charles Martel was not idle. As quickly as he could  he got together a great army of Franks and Germans and marched  against the Saracens. The two armies met between the cities of  Tours and Poitiers (_pwaw-te-ay_) in October, 732. For six days  there was nothing but an occasional skirmish between small parties  from both sides; but on the seventh day a great battle took place.    Both Christians and Mohammedans fought with terrible earnestness.  The fight went on all day, and the field was covered with the bodies  of the slain. But towards evening, during a resolute charge made by  the Franks, Abd-er-Rahman was killed. Then the Saracens gradually  retired to their camp."]]]
