This  portion is divided by a median fissure into two lobes, which play an  important part in the development of the head, and will be termed the  'procephalic lobes.' I have already made use of this term for the  corresponding parts in the embryos of Crustacea. The rudimentary thorax  presents traces of a division into three segments; and the dorso-lateral  margins of the cephalic blastoderm, behind the procephalic lobes, have a  sinuous margin. It is in embryos between this and 1/100th of an inch in  length, that the rudiments of the appendages make their appearance; and  by the growth of the cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal blastoderm,  curious changes are effected in the relative position of those regions.\"    In _Chrysopa oculata_, one of the Hemerobiidae, Packard has described[19]  and figured a stage in which the body segments have made their  appearance, but in which he says \"there are no indications of limbs. The  primitive band is fully formed, the protozorites being distinctly  marked, the transverse impressed lines indicating the primitive segments  being distinct, and the median furrow easily discerned.\" Here also,  again, the dorsal walls are incomplete, and the internal organs as yet  unformed.    In certain Dragon-flies (_Calepteryx_), and _Hemiptera_ (_Hydrometra_), the  legs, according to Brandt,[20] appear at a still earlier stage.    According to the observations of Koelliker,[21] it would appear that in  the Coleopterous genus _Donacia_ the segments and appendages appear  simultaneously.    Koelliker himself, however, frankly admits that \"meae de hoc insecto  observationes satis sunt manca,\" and it is possible that he may never  have met with an embryo in the state immediately preceding the  appearance of the legs; especially as it appears from the observations  of Kowalevski that in _Hydrophilus_ the appendages do not make their  appearance until after the segments.[22]    On the whole, as far as we can judge from the observations as yet  recorded, it seems that in Homomorphous insects the ventral wall is  developed and divided into segments, before the appearance of the legs;  but that the latter are formed almost simultaneously with the cephalic  appendages, and before either the dorsal walls of the body or the  internal organs.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Egg of _Pholcus opilionides_ (after Claparede).]    As it is interesting, from this point of view, to compare the  development of other Articulata with that of insects, I give a figure  (Fig. 32), representing an early stage in the development of a spider  (_Pholcus_) after Claparede,[23] who says, \"C'est a ce moment qu'a lieu  la formation des _protozonites_ ou segments primordiaux du corps de  l'embryon. Le rudiment ventral s'epaissit suivant six zones disposees  transversalement entre le capuchon anal et le capuchon cephalique.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Embryo of _Julus_ (after Newport).]    Among Centipedes the development of _Julus_ has been described by  Newport.[24] The first period, from the deposition of the egg to the  gradual bursting of the shell, and exposure of the embryo within it,  which, however, remains for some time longer in connection with the  shell, lasts for twenty-five days. The segments of the body, originally  six in number, make their appearance on the twentieth day after the  deposition of the egg, at which time there were no traces of legs. The  larva, when it leaves the egg, is a soft, white, legless grub (Fig. 33),  consisting of a head and seven segments, the head being somewhat firmer  in texture than the rest of the body. It exhibits rudimentary antennae,  but the legs are still only represented by very slight papilliform  processes on the undersides of the segments to which they belong.    As already mentioned, it is possible that at one time the vermiform  state of the Homomorphous insects--which, as we have seen, is now so  short, and passed through at so early a stage of development--was more  important, more prolonged, and accompanied by a more complete condition  of the internal organs. The compression, and even disappearance of those  embryonal stages which are no longer adapted to the mode of life--which  do not benefit the animal--is a phenomenon not without a parallel in  other parts of the animal or even of the vegetable kingdom. Just as in  language long compound words have a tendency to concision, and single  letters sometimes linger on, indicating the history of a word, like the  \"l\" in \"alms,\" or the \"b\" in \"debt,\" long after they have ceased to  influence the sound; so in embryology useless stages, interesting as  illustrations of past history, but without direct advantage under  present conditions, are rapidly passed through, and even, as it would  appear, in some cases altogether omitted.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Colony of _Bougainvillea fruticosa_, natural  size, to the underside of a piece of floating timber (after Allman).]    For instance, among the Hydroida, in the great majority of cases, the  egg produces a body more or less resembling the common _Hydra_ of our  ponds, and known technically as the \"trophosome,\" which develops into  the well-known Medusae or jelly-fishes. The group, however, for which  Prof. Allman has proposed the term Monopsea,[25] and of which the genus  _Aegina_ may be taken as the type, is, as he says, distinguished by the  absence of a hydriform stage, \"the ovum becoming developed through  direct metamorphosis into a medusiform body, just as in the other orders  it is developed into a hydriform body.\" Fig. 34 represents, after  Allman, a colony of _Bougainvillea fruticosa_ of the natural size. It is  a British species, which is found growing on buoys, floating timber,  &c., and, says Allman,[26] \"when in health and vigour, offers a  spectacle unsurpassed in interest by any other species--every branchlet  crowned by its graceful hydranth and budding with Medusae in all stages  of development (Fig. 35), some still in the condition of minute buds, in  which no trace of the definite Medusa-form can yet be detected; others,  in which the outlines of the Medusa can be distinctly traced within the  transparent _ectotheque_ (external layer); others, again, just casting  off this thin outer pellicle, and others completely freed from it,  struggling with convulsive efforts to break loose from the colony, and  finally launched forth in the full enjoyment of their freedom into the  surrounding water. I know of no form in which so many of the  characteristic features of a typical hydroid are more finely expressed  than in this beautiful species.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Portion of colony of _Bougainvillea fruticosa_,  more magnified.]    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--The Medusa form of the same species.]    Fig. 36 represents the Medusa form of this species, and the development  thus described may be regarded as typical of the Hydroida; yet, as  already mentioned, the Aeginidae do not present us with any stage  corresponding to the fixed condition of _Bougainvillea_, but, on the  contrary, are developed into Medusae direct from the egg.    On the other hand, there are groups in which the Medusiform stage  becomes less and less important.    [Illustration: FIG. 37, Larva of Prawn, Nauplius stage (after F.  Mueller). 38, Larva of Prawn, more advanced, Zoea stage.]    The great majority of the higher Crustacea go through well-marked  metamorphoses. Figs. 37 and 38 represent two stages in the development  of the prawn. In the first (Fig. 37), representing the young animal as  it quits the egg, the body is more or less oval and unsegmented; there  is a median frontal eye, and three pairs of natatory feet, the first  pair simple, while the two posterior are two-branched. Very similar  larvae occur in various other groups of Crustacea. They were at first  regarded as mature forms, and O. F. Mueller gave them the name of  Nauplius. So also, the second or Zoea form (Fig. 38) was at first  supposed to be a mature animal, until its true nature was discovered by  Vaughan Thompson.    The Zoea form of larva differs from the perfect prawn or crab in the  absence of the middle portion of the body and its appendages. The  mandibles have no palpi, the maxillipeds or foot-jaws are used as feet,  whereas in the mature form they serve as jaws. Branchiae are either  wanting or rudimentary, respiration being principally effected through  the walls of the carapace. The abdomen and tail are destitute of  articulate appendages. The development of Zoea into the perfect animal  has been well described by Mr. Spence Bate[27] in the case of the common  crab (_Carcinus maenas_).    All crabs, as far as we know, with the exception of a species of land  crab (_Gegarcinus_), described by Westwood, pass through a stage more or  less resembling that shown in Fig. 38. On the other hand, the great  group of Edriopthalma, comprising Amphipoda (shore-hoppers, &c.) and  Isopoda (wood-lice, &c.) pass through no such metamorphosis; the  development is direct, as in the Orthoptera. It is true that one  species, _Tanais Dulongii_, though a typical Isopod in form and general  character, is said to retain in some points, and especially in the mode  of respiration, some peculiarities of the Zoea type; but this is quite  an exceptional case. In _Mysis_, says F. Mueller,[28] \"there is still a  trace of the Nauplius stage; being transferred back to a period when it  had not to provide for itself, the Nauplius has become degraded into a  mere skin; in _Ligia_ this larva-skin has lost the traces of limbs, and  in _Philoscia_ it is scarcely demonstrable.\"    The Echinodermata in most cases \"go through a very well-marked  metamorphosis, which often has more than one larval stage.... The mass  of more or less differentiated sarcode, of which the larva, or  pseud-embryo, as opposed to the Echinoderm within it, is made up, always  carries upon its exterior certain bilaterally-arranged ciliated bands,  by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#9)"],[1,"as they.    At last, a little dome-shaped mound of grasses, half hidden among the  dry brown oak leaves and wild geranium, gladdened her eyes. Running  around to the opposite side she knelt down on the grass, peeped under  the arched roof {61} and into the nest, which was shaped like an  old-fashioned Dutch oven. Was ever a sight so welcome? She almost  screamed with joy. Through the opening on one side, that was about  three inches high, she could see the lining of fine black rootlets,  just like the one she had watched the bird snap off and carry away.  Then she flew home, as if she too had wings, and, calling breathlessly  \"Oh Father! Father! I've found it!\" burst into the house. A week  before even one white speckled egg had been laid in the oven-bird's  nest, there was a golden half eagle in a happy little girl's palm. A  fortnight later a man with a camera took a picture of the patient  mother-bird, whose pretty striped head you see peeping out from under  the dome.      MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT    _Called also: Black-masked Ground Warbler_    This gay little warbler looks as if he were dressed for a masquerade  ball with a gray-edged black mask over his face and the sides of his  throat, a brownish green coat and a bright yellow vest. He is smaller  than a sparrow. How sharply the inquisitive fellow peers at you  through his mask whenever you pass the damp thicket, bordering the  marshy land, where he {62} likes best to live! And how quickly he hops  from twig to twig and flies from one clump of bushes to another clump,  in restless, warbler fashion, as he leads you a dance in pursuit! Not  for a second does he stop watching you.    If you come too close, a sharp _pit-pit_ or _chock_ is snapped out by  the excited bird, whose familiar, oft-repeated, sprightly, waltzing  triplet has been too freely translated, he thinks, into, _Fol-low-me,  fol-low-me, fol-low-me_. Pursuit is the last thing he really desires,  and of course he issues no such invitation. What he actually says  almost always sounds to me like _Witchee-tee, witch-ee-tee,  witch-ee-tee_. You will surely hear him if you listen in his marshy  retreats. He sings almost all summer. Except when nesting he comes  into the garden, picks minute insects out of the blossoming shrubbery,  hops about on the ground, visits the raspberry tangle, and hides among  the bushes along the roadside. Only the yellow warbler, of all his  numerous tribe, is disposed to be more neighbourly. In spite of his  local name, he is to be found in winter from Georgia to Labrador and  Manitoba westward to the Plains. You see he is something of a  traveller.    The little bird who bewitches him, and to whom he sings the witch's  song, wears no black mask, so it is not easy to name her if her mate  is not about. Her plumage is duller than his and {63} the sides of her  plump little body, which are yellowish brown, shade into grayish white  underneath. Sometimes you may catch her carrying weeds, strips of  bark, broad grasses, tendrils, reeds, and leaves for the outside of  her deep cradle, and finer grasses for its lining, to a spot on the  ground where plants and low bushes help conceal it. She does not build  so beautiful a nest as the yellow warbler, but like her she, too, poor  thing, sometimes suffers from the sneaking visits of the cowbird.  Unhappily, she is not so clever as her cousin, for she meekly consents  to hatch out the cowbird's egg and let the big, greedy interloper  crowd and worry and starve her own brood. Why does the cowardly  cowbird always choose a victim smaller than herself?      THE YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT    \"Now he barks like a puppy, then quacks like a duck, then rattles like  a kingfisher, then squalls like a fox, then caws like a crow, then  mews like a cat--_C-r-r-r-r-r-whrr_--that's it--_Chee-quack, cluck,  yit-yit-yit-now_--hit it--_tr-r-r-r-wheu-caw-caw-cut,  cut-tea-boy-who, who-mew, mew_,\" writes John Burroughs of this  rollicking polyglot, the chat; but not even that close student of  nature could set down on {64} paper all the multitude of queer sounds  with which the bird amuses himself. He might be mistaken for a dozen  different birds and animals in as many minutes.    Such a secretive roysterer is he that you may rarely see him, however  often you may hear his voice when he is hidden beyond sight in partial  clearings or the bushy, briery, thickety openings in the woods. As he  seems to delight in keeping pursuers off by a natural fence of barbed  wire, the cat brier, wild blackberry, raspberry, and rose bushes are  among his favourite plants. But if you will sit down quietly near his  home, your patience will probably be rewarded by the sight of this  largest of the warblers, with olive green upper parts, a conspicuous  white line running from his bill around his eye and another along his  throat, and a bright yellow breast shading to grayish white  underneath. He is over an inch longer than the English sparrow. His  wife looks just like him.    The zany at the circus can go through no more clownish tricks than the  chat. See him, a mere bunch of feathers, dance and balance in the air,  now fluttering, now falling as if he had been shot, or turning aerial  somersaults, now rising and trailing his legs behind him like a stork,  now dropping out of sight in the thickest part of the thicket. The  instant he spies you, _Chut-Chut_, he scolds from the briars. Shy,  {65} eccentric, absurd, but inspired with a \"fine frenzy,\" which is a  passionate love for his mate and their nest, all his queer notes and  equally queer stunts centre about his home. On moonlight nights,  Punchinello entertains himself and Columbine with a series of  inimitable performances which have earned him the title of yellow  mockingbird. He can throw his voice so that it seems to come from  quite a different direction, as you may sometime have heard a  human ventriloquist do.      THE REDSTART    When this exquisite little warbler flashes his brilliant salmon flame  and black feathers among the trees, darting hither and thither,  fluttering, spinning about in the air after insects caught chiefly on  the wing, you will surely agree that he is the most beautiful as well  as the most lively bird in the woods. The colour scheme of his clothes  suggests the Baltimore oriole's, only the flaming feathers on the  sides of his body, wings, and tail are a pinker shade of flame, and  the black ones which cover his back, throat, and upper breast, are  more glossy, with bluish reflections. Underneath he is white, tinged  with salmon. But you could not possibly mistake this lovely little  sprite for the oriole, he is so much smaller--about an inch {66}  shorter than the sparrow. His cousin, the Blackburnian warbler, a much  rarer bird, with a colour scheme of black, white, and beautiful rich  orange, not salmon flame, can be named instantly by the large amount  of white in his tail feathers. There are so few brilliantly coloured  birds that find their way to us from the tropics, that it should not  take any boy or girl longer to learn them than it does to learn the  first multiplication table. In Cuba the redstart is known as \"El  Candelita\"--the little candle flame that flashes in the deep, dark,  tropical forest.    Who would believe that this small firebrand, half glowing, half  charred, whirling about through the trees, as if blown by the wind, is  a cousin of the sombre oven-bird that walks so daintily and leisurely  over the ground? The redstart keeps perpetually in motion that he may  seize gnats and other gauzy winged mouthfuls in mid-air--not as the  flycatchers do, by waiting on a fence rail or limb of a tree for a  dinner to fly past, then dashing out and seizing it, but by flitting  about constantly in search of insect prey. The bristles at the base of  his bill prevent many an insect from getting past it. He rests on the  trees only long enough to snatch a morsel, then away he goes again. No  wonder the Spaniards call all the gaily coloured, tropical wood  warblers \"Mariposas\"--butterflies.    {67}    CHAPTER V    THE VIREOS:    ANOTHER STRICTLY AMERICAN FAMILY      Red-Eyed Vireo    White-Eyed Vireo    Yellow-Throated Vireo    Warbling Vireo      {68}    {69}    THE VIREOS    You know that if the birds should suddenly perish, there wouldn't be a  leaf, a blade of grass, or any green thing left upon the earth within  a few years--it would be uninhabitable.    When Dame Nature, the most thorough of housekeepers, gave to the birds  the task of restraining insects within bounds so that man and beast  could live, she gave the care of foliage to the vireos. It is true  that most of the warblers, and a few other birds too, hunt for their  food among the leaves, but with nothing like the vireo's painstaking  care and thoroughness. The nervous, restless warblers flit from twig  to twig without half exploring the foliage; whereas the deliberate,  methodical vireos search leisurely above and below it, cocking their  little heads so as to look up at the under side of the leaf above them  and to peck off the destroyers hidden there--bugs of many kinds and  countless little worms, caterpillars, weevils, inchworms, May beetles,  and leaf-eating beetles. Singing as they go, no birds more  successfully combine work and play.    Because they spend their lives among the foliage, the vireos are  protectively coloured; with {70} soft grayish or olive green on their  backs, wings, and tail, whitish or yellow below. Some people call them  greenlets. They are all a little smaller than sparrows. More  inconspicuous birds it would be hard to find or more abundant,  although so commonly overlooked except by people on the look-out for  them. Where the new growth of foliage at the ends of the branches is  young and tender, many insects prefer to lay their eggs that their  babies may have the most dainty fare as soon as they are hatched. They  do not reckon upon the vireos' visits.    Toward"]]]
