However, if the specimen is permitted to dry  slightly, the annulus tympanicus becomes visible through the skin and a  tympanum/eye ratio can be computed.    One of the few cases of sympatry within the genus _Syrrhophus_ involves  this species; _modestus_ and _nivocolimae_ are known to be sympatric at  one locality in southwestern Jalisco, Mexico.    Duellman (1958) used the trinomial for this population and named a new  subspecies, _pallidus_, from Nayarit. I consider _pallidus_ to be  specifically distinct from _modestus_ because there is no evidence of  genetic exchange, and there is no overlap in the distinguishing  morphological features. I do consider the two populations to be closely  related but feel the interrelationships between _modestus_, _pallidus_,  _nivocolimae_, and _teretistes_ are more complex than would be indicated  by the use of trinomials. The sympatric occurrence of _modestus_ and  _nivocolimae_ is significant; morphologically, they might otherwise be  regarded as subspecies. Although allopatric, similar arguments could be  advanced for the morphologically similar _pallidus_ and _teretistes_.  The four are here afforded species rank since morphological similarity  and allopatry are not sufficient grounds for the assumption of genetic  exchange.

Webb].    _Diagnosis._--Small frogs, males 18.5-21.1 mm. snout-vent length, only  known female 24.1 mm. snout-vent; vocal slits present in males; finger  tips widely expanded; first finger shorter than second; inner metatarsal  tubercle about three times size of outer; skin of dorsum warty, that of  venter smooth; tympanum concealed, its diameter 30.0-39.3 per cent that  of eye in males; mid-dorsal brown band from interorbital bar to anus;  bands on limbs narrow, dark bands less than one-half width of light  bands, upper arm not banded; narrow interorbital light bar.    _Remarks._--This species is closely related to _S. modestus_ and differs  in color pattern and degree of wartiness of the skin. Dixon and Webb  (1966) held that _nivocolimae_ had no close relatives, but the condition  of the tympanum, size, nature of the outer palmar tubercle, relative  sizes of the metatarsal tubercles, and shape and size of the digital  pads all point to a close relationship between _S. modestus_,  _S. nivocolimae_, and _S. pallidus_.        [Illustration: FIG. 20: Distribution of the species of the         _modestus_ group: _interorbitalis_ (open circles), _teretistes_         (solid circles), _modestus_ (open triangles), _pallidus_ (solid         triangles) and _nivocolimae_ (square).

However, my examination  of the type series and several other specimens from Jalisco reveals that  the largest tympanum/eye ratio is 39.3 per cent. Therefore, the  tympanum/eye ratio in _S. nivocolimae_ is in agreement with those for  _S. modestus_, _S. pallidus_, and _S. teretistes_ (Table 6).    _Etymology._--_niv_, Latin, and Colima (Nevado de), meaning high on the  volcano, in reference to the higher distribution of this species (around  2000 meters) than other members of the group.    _Distribution._--Known from southwestern Jalisco, Mexico, at moderate to  high elevations (600-2400 meters).    _Specimens examined._--(48) MEXICO, _Jalisco_: 17.6 km.

Lacking evidence of genetic  exchange, I prefer to retain disjunct populations that are distinctive  as species.    All known specimens of _pallidus_ can be separated from those of  _modestus_ by color pattern. The two nominal species exhibit overlap in  proportions but the same can be said about nearly every species of  _Syrrhophus_; therefore, overlap in proportions can be disregarded in  assessing specific versus subspecific rank. Until contrary evidence is  forthcoming, I consider the disjunct populations heretofore held to be  subspecies of _modestus_ to be specifically distinct. The specimens of  the disjunct population of _pallidus_ on the Tres Marias do not differ  from the mainland population in Nayarit. This evidence, though perhaps  secondary, supports my contention that two species should be recognized.    _Etymology._--Latin, in reference to the pale ground color in comparison  with that of _S. modestus_.    _Distribution._--Low elevations in coastal Nayarit and on Islas Tres  Marias (Fig. 20).    _Specimens examined._--(12) MEXICO, _Nayarit_: 18.8 mi.

Gorham, 1966:167.    _Diagnosis._--Medium-sized frogs, males 19.2-23.2 mm. snout-vent length,  single known female 24.8 mm. snout-vent; vocal slits in males; finger  tips widely expanded; first finger shorter than second; inner metatarsal  tubercle about three times size of outer; skin of dorsum shagreened,  that of venter smooth; tympanum partially concealed, its diameter  28.6-43.8 per cent of eye in males; ground color brown vermiculated with  dark brown to nearly black; upper arm and thigh banded; interorbital  light bar absent.    _Remarks._--_S. teretistes_ appears to be most closely related to  _S. pallidus_; I consider it to be an upland derivative of _pallidus_.  Morphologically, the differences between the two are few, but lacking  evidence of genetic exchange they are retained as species.    _Etymology._--Greek, in reference to the whistle-like nature of the  call.    _Distribution._--Moderate elevations (840-1200 meters) in the Sierra  Occidental of Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Durango, Mexico (Fig. 20).    _Specimens examined._--(13) MEXICO, _Nayarit_: 4.8 km.

DISCUSSION      There are relatively few clear-cut morphological differences among the  fourteen species now assigned to _Syrrhophus_. The majority of the  species are allopatric and differ primarily in color patterns. Sympatric  occurrence serves as an indicator of specific distinctness and is one of  the more practical tests of species validity when cross-breeding  experiments are not possible. Two cases of sympatric occurrence are  known for the species of _Syrrhophus_ in western Mexico:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#9)"],[1,"st. There the  mariners traded in them and were refreshed with a delicious fruit,  called pique--pineapples.    They came to the knowledge here of a nutritious ground fruit called  battate. \"This,\" says our Italian, \"has the taste of a chestnut and is  the length of a shuttle.\" These ground fruits were potatoes.    The people here seem to have been very liberal in trading.    They would give six fowls for a knife--well they might do so, as they  used stone implements.    They gave _two_ geese for a comb--here they were both generous and wise.    They gave as great a quantity of fish as ten men could eat for a pair of  scissors.    And for a bell, they gave a whole basket full of potatoes (battate).    Marvelous indeed as was this same country of Verzim, it also abounded  in the conditions and atmospheres of long life.    \"Some of these people,\" says our Italian chronicler, \"live to be a  hundred or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and forty or more. They  wear little clothing.\"    Which speaks well for pineapples, potatoes, and easy dress.    \"They sleep on cotton nets, which are fastened on large timbers, and  stretch from one end of the house to another.\"    It is good to sleep in ample ventilation. We do not wonder that many of  the people passed a hundred years.    The boats of these people were as simple as their open houses.    \"These are not made with iron instruments, for there are none, but with  stones.\"    The canoes were dug out of one long tree--some giant growth of the  forest which would convey from thirty to forty men. The paddles for  these canoes resembled shovels. The rowers were usually black men.    The people ate human flesh, but only at feasts of triumph. They then  served up their enemies.    Pigafetta draws the following grewsome picture:    \"They do not eat up the whole body of a man whom they take prisoner;  they eat him bit by bit, and for fear that he should be spoiled, they  cut him up into pieces, which they set to dry before the chimney. They  eat this day by day, so as to keep in mind the memory of their enemy.\"    This was indeed the sweet food of revenge, and as barbarous as it seems,  the spirit of revenge secretly cherished is hardly less unworthy when it  finds expression in words that are bitter, if not carnal.    The region abounded with bright birds, yet with all these delights, and  pineapples and potatoes, there fell great rains. So there were shadows  in the sunlands.    We can fancy Pigafetta relating his discoveries on the shore to a  susceptible spirit, like Del Cano, and writing an account of them day by  day in his immortal journal.    These strange adventures by sea and on land which so greatly interested  the Italian Knight Pigafetta, our historian, do not seem to have greatly  impressed the mind of Magellan. The lands had been sighted before. His  whole soul was bent on one purpose--not on rediscovery, but on  discovery. He was sailing now where other keels had been. It was his  purpose to find new ways for the world to follow over unknown seas. His  heart could find no full satisfaction but in water courses that sails  had never swept; a new way to the Moluccas that no ship had ever broken.    Notwithstanding the friendly spirit and liberal patronage of the  Emperor, he still stood against the world. He represented a cast-out  name. His own countrymen, on his own ships in the long delays on the  voyage to unknown seas, were plotting against him.    Let us recall in fancy a night scene as the ships lay on the waters of  the meridional world. Magellan sits alone in one of the castles of the  ship and looks out on the phosphorescent sea. The stars above him shine  in a clear splendor, and are reflected in the sea. The sky seems to be  in the waters; the waters are a mirror of the sky. Among the clear stars  the Southern Cross, always vivid, here rises high. Magellan lifts to it  his eye, and feels the religious inspiration of the suggestion. He is a  son of the Church, and he holds that all discoveries are to be made for  the glory of the Cross.    On the distant shores palms rise in armies in the dusky air. The shores  are silent. When arose the tall people that inhabited them?    Magellan dreams: he wonders at himself, at his inward commission; at his  cast-out name and great opportunity.    One of his trusty friends comes to him; he is a Spaniard and his  disquieting words break the serenity of the scene.    \"Captain General, it hurts my soul to say it, but there is disloyalty on  the ships--it is everywhere.\"    \"I seem to feel the atmospheres of it,\" said Magellan. \"Why should it  be? The sea and the sky promise us success. Who are disloyal?\"    \"Captain General, they are your own countrymen!\"    \"And why do they plot treason under the Cross of discovery?\"    \"Captain General, if the ocean open new ways before you, and you should  achieve all of which you dream, they will have little share in the  glory; you are facing stormy waters and perils unknown, not for  Portugal, but for Spain.\"    \"Not for Spain alone, nor for Portugal, but for the glory of the Cross,  and the good of all the world. A divine will leads me, and sustains me,  and directs me. I am not seeking gold or fame or any personal advantage;  my soul goes forth to reveal the wonders and the benevolence of  Providence to the heart of the whole world. I go alone, and feel the  loneliness of my lot. I left all that I had to make this expedition. It  is my purpose to discover unknown seas. Joy, rapture, and recompense  would come to me, beyond wealth or fame, could my eyes be the first to  see a new ocean world, and to carry back the knowledge of it to all  nations. What happiness would it be to me to ride on uncharted tides! My  friend, you are loyal to me?\"    \"Captain General, I am loyal, and the Spanish sailors are loyal; it is  your own men who plot in dark corners to bring your plans to naught.\"    In the shadow of one of the tall castles of another ship sit a band of  idle men. They are Portuguese.    One of them, who seems to lead the minds of the others, is whittling,  and after a long silence says:    \"We do not know where we are going, and wherever we are going, we are  Portuguese and are slaves to Spain.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" returned an old Portuguese sailor, \"and when we go back again,  should that ever be, the profit to us will be little at the India  House.\"    \"Right,\" answered a number of voices, and one ventured to say:    \"Magellan, after all, may be mad, like his old companion, the  astronomer. Both came from the same place in Portugal.\"    Some of the officers had schemes of their own.    But the ships crept on and on, along the Brazilian coast, where the flag  of Spain and the farol guided them in the track of the Admiral they  followed. Night after night the lantern of the flagship gleamed in the  air, moving toward cooler waters under the Southern Cross.    And in Magellan's heart was a single purpose, and he anticipated the joy  of a great discovery, as a revelation that would answer the prophetic  light that shone like a star in his own spiritual vision. On, and on!          CHAPTER X.    THE FIRST GIANT.--THE ISLANDS OF GEESE AND GOSLINGS.--THE DANCING  GIANTS.      The narrative of Pigafetta, the Knight of Rhodes, has much curious lore  in regard to giants. At a place on the coast, formerly called Cape St.  Mary, the first of these giants appeared.    He was a leader of a tribe \"who ate human flesh.\" The lively Knight of  Rhodes informs us that this man, who towered above his fellows, \"had a  voice like a bull.\"    He came to one of the captains' ships and asked--of course in sign  language; for a man may have a \"voice like a bull\" and yet fail to be  understood in cannibal tongues--if he might come on board the ship and  bring his fellows with him.    He left a quantity of goods on the shore. While he was negotiating at  the ships, his people on the shore, who seem to have been unusually wise  and prudent, began to remove the stores of goods from exposure to danger  to a kind of castle at some distance.    The officers of the ships grew inpatient when they saw the tempting  goods being thus removed. So they landed a hundred men to recover the  goods, which they seemed to have deemed theirs after the \"right of  discovery.\"    The men began to run after the provident natives, when they became  greatly surprised. The natives seemed to _fly_ over the ground, and  leave them behind at a humiliating distance.    \"They did more in one step than we could do at a bound,\" says Pigafetta,  Knight of Rhodes.    The giant people here showed that there was need to approach them with  caution. Some time before, these \"Canibali\" had captured a Spanish sea  captain and sixty men, who had landed and pastured inland to make  discoveries. They ate them all--a fearful feast!    Our voyagers probably had no desire to go too far inland in view of such  a warning; so they returned and proceeded on their course toward the  antarctic pole.    They discovered two small islands, which had more agreeable inhabitants  than the land of Cape St. Mary. \"These islands,\" says our good Knight  Pigafetta, \"were full of geese and goslings and sea wolves.\" He adds:  \"We loaded five ships with them for an hour.\"    The Knight has also left us the following curious picture of the birds,  which must have been very much surprised at being so rudely disturbed:    \"The geese are black, and have feathers all over the body of the same  size and shape; and they do not fly but live on fish, and they were so  fat that we did not pluck them, but skinned them. They have beaks like  that of a crow.    \"The sea wolves of these islands are of many colors and of the size and  thickness of a calf, and have a head like a calf, and ears small and  round. They have teeth but no legs, but feet joining close to the body,  which resemble a human hand. They have small nails to their feet, and  skin between the fingers like geese.    \"I"]]]
