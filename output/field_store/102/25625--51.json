Our friend Baneelon, during this season of scarcity, was as well taken care  of as our desperate circumstances would allow. We knew not how to keep  him, and yet were unwilling to part with him. Had he penetrated our state,  perhaps he might have given his countrymen such a description of our  diminished numbers, and diminished strength, as would have emboldened  them to become more troublesome. Every expedient was used to keep him in  ignorance. His allowance was regularly received by the governor's servant,  like that of any other person, but the ration of a week was insufficient  to have kept him for a day. The deficiency was supplied by fish whenever  it could be procured, and a little Indian corn, which had been reserved  was ground and appropriated to his use. In spite of all these aids, want of  food has been known to make him furious and often melancholy.    There is reason to believe that he had long meditated his escape, which he  effected in the night of the 3rd instant. About two o'clock in the morning,  he pretended illness, and awaking the servant who lay in the room with him,  begged to go down stairs. The other attended him without suspicion of his  design; and Baneelon no sooner found himself in a backyard, than he nimbly  leaped over a slight paling, and bade us adieu.    The following public order was issued within the date of this chapter, and  is too pleasing a proof that universal depravity did not prevail among the  convicts, to be omitted.      The governor, in consequence of the unremitted good behaviour and  meritorious conduct of John Irving, is pleased to remit the remainder of  the term for which he was sentenced to transportation. He is therefore to  be considered as restored to all those rights and privileges, which had  been suspended in consequence of the sentence of the law. And as such,  he is hereby appointed to act as an assistant to the surgeon at Norfolk  Island.          CHAPTER VII        Transactions of the Colony in June, July, and August, 1790.      At length the clouds of misfortune began to separate, and on the evening  of the 3rd of June, the joyful cry of \"the flag's up\" resounded in every  direction.    I was sitting in my hut, musing on our fate, when a confused clamour in  the street drew my attention. I opened my door, and saw several women  with children in their arms running to and fro with distracted looks,  congratulating each other, and kissing their infants with the most  passionate and extravagant marks of fondness. I needed no more; but  instantly started out, and ran to a hill, where, by the assistance of  a pocket glass, my hopes were realized. My next door neighbour, a  brother-officer, was with me, but we could not speak. We wrung each other  by the hand, with eyes and hearts overflowing.    Finding that the governor intended to go immediately in his boat down the  harbour, I begged to be of his party.    As we proceeded, the object of our hopes soon appeared: a large ship,  with English colours flying, working in, between the heads which form the  entrance of the harbour. The tumultuous state of our minds represented  her in danger; and we were in agony. Soon after, the governor, having  ascertained what she was, left us, and stepped into a fishing boat to  return to Sydney. The weather was wet and tempestuous but the body is  delicate only when the soul is at ease. We pushed through wind and rain,  the anxiety of our sensations every moment redoubling. At last we read the  word 'London' on her stern. \"Pull away, my lads! She is from Old England! A  few strokes more, and we shall be aboard! Hurrah for a bellyfull, and news  from our friends!\" Such were our exhortations to the boat's crew.    A few minutes completed our wishes, and we found ourselves on board  the 'Lady Juliana' transport, with two hundred and twenty-five of our  countrywomen whom crime or misfortune had condemned to exile. We learned  that they had been almost eleven months on their passage, having left  Plymouth, into which port they had put in July, 1789. We continued to ask  a thousand questions on a breath. Stimulated by curiosity, they inquired in  turn; but the right of being first answered, we thought, lay on our side.  \"Letters, letters!\" was the cry. They were produced, and torn open in  trembling agitation. News burst upon us like meridian splendor on a blind  man. We were overwhelmed with it: public, private, general, and particular.  Nor was it until some days had elapsed, that we were able to methodise it,  or reduce it into form. We now heard for the first time of our sovereign's  illness, and his happy restoration to health. The French revolution of  1789, with all the attendant circumstances of that wonderful and unexpected  event, succeeded to amaze us*. Now, too, the disaster which had befallen  the 'Guardian', and the liberal and enlarged plan on which she had been  stored and fitted out by government for our use, was promulged. It served  also, in some measure, to account why we had not sooner heard from England.  For had not the 'Guardian' struck on an island of ice, she would probably  have reached us three months before, and in this case have prevented the  loss of the 'Sirius', although she had sailed from England three months  after the 'Lady Juliana'.    [*These words bring to my mind an anecdote, which, though rather out of  place, I shall offer no apology for introducing. Among other inquiries, we  were anxious to learn whether M. de la Peyrouse, with the two ships under  his command, bound on a voyage of discovery, had arrived in France. We  heard with concern, that no accounts of them had been received, since they  had left Botany Bay, in March, 1788. I remember when they were at that  place, one day conversing with Monsieur de la Peyrouse, about the best  method of treating savage people, \"Sir,\" said he, \"I have sometimes been  compelled to commit hostilities upon them, but never without suffering the  most poignant regret; for, independent of my own feelings on the occasion,  his Majesty's (Louis XVI) last words to me, de sa propre bouche, when I  took leave of him at Versailles, were: 'It is my express injunction, that  you always treat the Indian nations with kindness and humanity. Gratify  their wishes, and never, but in a case of the last necessity, when  self-defence requires it, shed human blood.' Are these the sentiments of a  tyrant, of a sanguinary and perfidious man?\"    A general thanksgiving to Almighty God, for his Majesty's recovery, and  happy restoration to his family and subjects, was ordered to be offered up  on the following Wednesday, when all public labour was suspended; and every  person in the settlement attended at church, where a sermon, suited to an  occasion, at once so full of gratitude and solemnity, was preached by the  Reverend Richard Johnson, chaplain of the colony.    All the officers were afterwards entertained at dinner by the governor. And  in the evening, an address to his excellency, expressive of congratulation  and loyalty, was agreed upon; and in two days after was presented, and very  graciously received.    The following invitation to the non-commissioned officers and private  soldiers of the marine battalion, was also about this time published.      In consequence of the assurance that was given to the non-commissioned  officers and men belonging to the battalion of marines, on their embarking  for the service of this country, that such of them as should behave well,  would be allowed to quit the service, on their return to England; or be  discharged abroad, upon the relief taking place, and permitted to settle  in the country--His Majesty has been graciously pleased to direct the  following encouragement to be held up to such non-commissioned officers and  privates, as may be disposed to become settlers in this country, or in  any of the islands comprised within the government of the continent of  New South Wales, on the arrival of the corps raised and intended for the  service of this colony, and for their relief, viz:    To every non-commissioned officer, an allotment of one hundred and thirty  acres of land, if single, and of one hundred and fifty acres, if married.  To every private soldier, an allotment of eighty acres, if single, and of  one hundred acres if married; and also an allotment of ten acres for every  child, whether of a non-commissioned officer, or of a private soldier.  These allotments will be free of all fines, taxes, quit-rents, and other  acknowledgments, for the space of ten years; but after the expiration of  that period, will be subject to an annual quit-rent of one shilling for  every fifty acres.    His Majesty has likewise been farther pleased to signify his royal will and  pleasure, that a bounty of three pounds be offered to each non-commissioned  officer and soldier, who may be disposed to continue in this country, and  enlist in the corps appointed for the service of New South Wales; with a  farther assurance, that in case of a proper demeanour on their part, they  shall, after a farther service of five years, be entitled to double the  former portion of land, provided they then choose to become settlers in the  country, free of all taxes, fines, and quit-rents, for the space of fifteen  years; but after that time, to be subject to the beforementioned annual  quit-rent of one shilling for every fifty acres.    And as a farther encouragement to those men who may be desirous to become  settlers, and continue in the country, his Majesty has been likewise  pleased to direct, that every man shall, on being discharged, receive out  of the public store, a portion of clothing and provisions, sufficient  for his support for one year; together with a suitable quantity of seeds,  grain, etc. for the tillage of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#9)"],[1,"of me, and then went to the patient. There was no  change, except in the increase of fatal symptoms. The delirium was more  furious, the pulse hard, full, frequent, and vibrating. The most  vigorous course was adopted; two other students were called in to assist  Stabb and myself, and every means used to give effect to the prescribed  treatment.    \"As for Mademoiselle de Coigny, she remained in the sitting-room, the  picture of intense anguish. I urged her to retire, but she shook her  head. I now begged her to tell me what had caused this strange attack,  but she was silent. At length I went and called Madame Lecomte--you  recollect what a kind-hearted creature she was--and told her briefly the  little I knew of the unfortunate girl. She answered the summons at once,  and in the most gentle manner endeavored to persuade Mademoiselle de  Coigny to go with her. It was in vain. She would not leave the room.  Occasionally, through the day, she would step to Dervilly's bedside, and  in the softest, sweetest, gentlest tone I ever heard, say, 'Alfred.' The  effect was always the same as at first--exciting the poor fellow to  still deeper paroxysms, and more violent exclamations. On the fourth day  he died; the symptoms becoming more and more aggravating, until _coma_  supervened to delirium. During the whole period of his sickness  Mademoiselle de Coigny never left the house--scarcely the room--Madame  Lecomte on two or three occasions almost forcing the wretched girl away  to her own apartments. When poor Dervilly sunk into that deep lethargic  slumber, so much dreaded by the physician, because so fatal, she came  almost joyfully into his chamber, and threw her arms tenderly around  him, 'He sleeps at last,' she said, 'is it not well?'    \"I would have given the world for the freedom of bursting into tears, so  deeply was I affected by that hopeful, trustful question. What could I  do, but shake my head mournfully and hasten out of the place.... He  died, and made no sign; not a word, not a look, not the slightest  pressure of the hand, for the one he loved so tenderly, and who watched  so anxiously for some slight token. 'Oh,' I exclaimed to myself, as the  hardness of such a fate was impressed on me, 'God is just, there is a  hereafter, these two _must_ meet again.' ... Emilie de Coigny left the  room where her dead lover lay, only when he himself was borne to his  last resting-place. She followed him to the spot where he was buried in  _Pere la Chaise_, and remained standing by it after every one else had  come away. In this position she was found--standing over the grave--late  at night by her friends--some members of the family I have  mentioned--who sought her out. She left that splendid city of the dead  bereft of reason, and so she has ever since continued. When the day is  fine, she invariably keeps her fancied engagement with her lover at the  appointed place in the _Jardin des Plants_; she patiently sits the hour,  and retires sadly, as you saw her. When the weather is forbidding, she  goes to her friend's house and waits the same period, never showing the  least symptom of impatience, but, on the contrary, evincing the signs of  a bruised but most gentle spirit.\" ...    Here Partridge paused, as if at the end of his story.    \"Is that all?\" said I.    \"That is all,\" he responded.    \"Surely not,\" I continued; \"you have said nothing about the strange  mystery which killed our poor friend, and which, as it seems to me, is  the main point, in the story.\"    \"True enough--it is singular I should have left it out, but it is  explained in a word. These same friends of Mademoiselle de Coigny gave  me the information. It appears that on one inclement night, as the  _keeper of the Morgue_ was returning from an official visit to the Chief  of Police, toward his own quarters, which are adjoining and over the  _dead room_--he stumbled over something which a flash of lightning at  the instant showed to be the body of a man. He was quite dead, but,  nestled down close by his side, with one of her little hands on his  face, was a child, about two years of age. Jean Maurice Sorel, although  long inured to repulsive sights, had not grown callous to misery. By  birth he was considerably above his somewhat ignominious office; he had  narrowly escaped with his life when Louis XVI. was brought to the  scaffold, for some indiscreet expressions that savored too much of  royalty; but in the tumults which succeeded, he had, he scarcely knew  how, through some influence with the chief of one of the departments,  been appointed to this repulsive duty. But as I have said, his heart was  just as kind as ever, after many years discharge of it; and Jean Maurice  Sorel, instead of repining at his lot, blessed God daily that he had the  means of supporting a wife and children, while so many of his old  friends had literally starved to death. Such was the person who stumbled  over the body of the dead man, and discovered the living child beside  it. He called at once for assistance, and had the corpse conveyed to his  house, while he carried the little girl in his arms. She was too young  to give any information about herself, but on searching the pockets of  the deceased, several papers were found which disclosed enough to  satisfy Jean Maurice Sorel that in the wasted, attenuated form before  him, he beheld his once friend and benefactor the Marquis de Coigny,  who, he supposed, had perished by the guillotine in the revolution. The  papers permitted no doubt of the fact that the little girl was his  granddaughter and only descendant, and she was commended to the care of  the kind-hearted when death should overtake him.    \"The old Marquis was buried, and the little Emilie adopted into the  family of the good Jean Maurice. Her education was conducted in a manner  far superior to that of his own children, and the choicest garments of  those which fell to him were selected to be made over for her. Perhaps  unwisely, her history was explained to her, so that she lived all her  life with the sense that she belonged in a different sphere--not that  she was ungrateful or unamiable--quite the contrary--she was sweet  tempered, affectionate and gentle, and loved by Jean Maurice and all his  family with a devoted fondness: but the world had charms for her which  the world withheld; she felt that she never could become an object of  love where she could love in return, and so she repined at her destiny.  By accident she made the acquaintance of the family where Dervilly first  met her. They had known her father and her grandfather, and she loved  them for that. She resisted for a long time the feeling for her lover  which she perceived was taking strong hold of her, and when she could  resist no longer, she yet delayed to tell him what a home she inhabited.  This was her pride--her weakness--and how terribly did she pay the  penalty! Day after day (so I was told), she resolved to explain all, but  she procrastinated, till her lover, no longer able to restrain his  anxiety, and full of excitements and fears and perturbations, followed  her at some little distance, just at twilight, and saw or fancied he saw  her enter _La Morgue_. It was too much for his nervous temperament. His  brain caught fire--he came home raving with delirium--and DIED! Now you  have the whole.\"          A LEGEND.    TRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL FROM THE SPANISH,    BY MRS. M. E. HEWITT.        \"Sin vos, y sin Dios y mi.\"          The motto that with trembling hand I write,        And deep is traced upon this heart of mine,      In olden time a loyal Christian knight        Bore graven on his shield to Palestine.        \"_Sin vos_,\" it saith, \"if I am without thee,\"        Beloved! whose thought surrounds me every where--      \"_Sin Dios_,\" I am without God, \"_y mi_,\"        And in myself I have no longer share.        Where pealed the clash of war, the mighty din,        Where trump and cymbal crashed along the sky;      High o'er the \"Il Allah!\" of the Moslemin,        \"God and my lady!\" rang his battle-cry.        His white plume waved where fiercest raged the flight,        His arm was strong the Paynim's course to stem:      His foot was foremost on the sacred height,        To plant the Cross above Jerusalem.        False proved the lady, and thenceforth the knight,        Casting aside the buckler and the brand,      Lived, an austere and lonely anchorite,        In a drear mountain-cave in Holy Land.        There, bowed before the Crucifix in prayer,        He would dash madly down his rosary,      And cry \"Beloved!\" in tones of wild despair,        \"I have lost God, and self, in losing thee!\"        And I, if thus my life's sweet hope were o'er,        An echo of the knight's despair must be;      Thus I were lost, if loved by thee no more,        For, ah! myself and heaven are merged in thee.
