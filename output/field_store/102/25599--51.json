I  searched about but could find no signs of the trap nor of the bear  and I could no longer follow the trail by the aid of the torch, the  last one being now pretty well burned out. There was nothing for me  to do but go back to camp and wait until morning.    When I was within a mile or less of camp, I heard the report of a gun  in the direction of camp and knew that Uncle had arrived and was  firing his gun to let me know that he was in camp. I answered the  call by firing my gun and hurried on to camp to see what had detained  him.    The bear had gone over the fallen tree while the end of the clog had  caught under the log and a weak link in the trap chain had given  away, Bruin going off with the trap. Uncle had followed the bear  several miles when dark came on. He followed down the stream to where  it came in to the branch that the camp was on, and being over a ridge  and so far from the camp was the cause of him not hearing the  gunshots that I had fired. Uncle followed the bear until dark so as  to know about where he was in case a snow should fall to fill up the  trail.    It was after midnight when we turned in but we were up in good season  the next morning and taking a lunch in our knapsacks and each a  blanket, we started for the wind jam to see if we could find the  bear. Uncle took me to the bear's trail at the edge of the wind jam  where I waited, giving him time to get around on the opposite side of  the jam, at a point, where the bear was likely to come out, provided  I should start him. I had not followed the trail far into the jam  before I came to where the bear had made a bed by breaking down  briers and gnawing down saplings, but he did not stay long at this  place when he again went on.    I soon came to another such bed and after finding several more, came  to one that was fresher than the others. I could see that the bed had  been made during the night. I now began to work my way along the  trail very cautiously with my gun in hand ready for action and my  heart in my mouth for I knew that Bruin would soon be on the move. I  worked my way through the jam at a snail's pace and soon heard the  rattle of the trap and could see the brush move not more than a  hundred feet away.    The undergrowth was so thick that I could get no distinct sight of  the bear but fired a shot more to let Uncle know that Bruin was on  the move than of any expectation of hitting him. When the gun cracked  the bear gave a snort like that of a frightened hog and I could hear  him tearing through the brush at a great rate. It was not long until  I heard Uncle shoot and in the course of two or three minutes I heard  him shoot again and knew that Bruin had given up the trap.    After I had gone along the trail quite a ways, I saw a few drops of  blood now and then and when I reached Uncle he was already skinning  the bear. We found three holes in the bear. Uncle's second shot which  was the finishing shot, hit the bear in the head. The shot that I  fired caught Bruin just forward of the hips and undoubtedly would  have killed him in time.    We skinned the bear and took the hind quarters, the skin and trap and  started for camp. I must say that I think this was the hardest stunt  of packing that I remember and every old trapper knows what sort of a  job of toting he often runs up against. We went down the run about  two miles before coming to the stream that our camp was on, and then  we had to go up this stream about four miles to camp. When we reached  the stream it was dark; there was no path and there was a great deal  of fallen timber and undergrowth along the creek, the creek winding  around from one side of the valley to the other. It was a continual  fording of the creek, climbing over fallen timber, through  undergrowth and what not. You know no one but a trapper would be  silly enough to do such a stunt in the dark. We arrived at camp about  9 o'clock, wet, tired and hungry. The next morning Uncle was still a  little sore but I was as good as new and ready for another job of the  same kind.    Some days later we had a fall of snow of several inches and the  second or third day after the snow came we heard a number of gunshots  south of the camp on the ridge in the direction that we had a bear  trap set. It was near sundown and as we were not aware that there was  anyone camping or living in the direction of the gunshots, we  concluded it was hunters shooting at deer. The shots were at such  long intervals that Uncle said he did not think it was anyone  shooting at deer and that the shots sounded like they were right  where we had a bear trap set and that he thought hunters had run onto  a bear in our trap and were shooting at it. It was then too late to  go to the trap. Uncle said we would get up early in the morning for  he was sure the gunshots were close in the neighborhood in which our  trap was set, and he thought it likely that we had a bear in the  trap.    We were on the way before it was fairly daylight but when we came to  the place where the trap had been set we found it gone. We followed  the trail a short distance when the tracks of three men came onto the  trail. The men had stamped and tracked about where they came onto the  trail as though they were holding a council and then all started off  on the trail of the bear. They did not go far before they came up  with the bear where the trap clog had become fast between two  saplings. The trap was nowhere to be seen. The men had made many  tracks where they killed the bear.    Uncle said it looked as though the men intended to steal the bear  trap and all. We saw where the track of a man led off towards a large  log and returned. Uncle told me to follow that man's tracks and see  what he went out there for, as probably he hid the trap behind the  log. I found the trap clog behind the log but there was no trap. It  was snowing some at the time the men killed the bear.    When we found that the men had taken the trap and hid the trap clog  Uncle exclaimed, \"The varmints intend to steal our bear.\" We followed  the trail of the men as fast as we could for we were quite sure they  must have stopped over night not far from there for it was nearly  dark when they killed the bear. Their trail led down the hillside to  the main stream, then down the creek and we hustled after them as  fast as we could go. After going down the creek a mile or more we saw  a smoke and Uncle said, \"There the varmints are,\" and he was right.  We were none too soon as the men were already hitching the horses to  the sleigh ready to start off. We could see that the bear was already  on the sleigh, although it was covered over with a blanket. The men  started at us but did not say a word.    Uncle walked up to the end of the sleigh, caught a corner of the  blanket, threw it back and uncovered the bear. Then taking the bear  by the foreleg he gave it a flop onto the ground saying, \"You have a  bear, haven't you,\" and the bear rolled to the ground and uncovered  the trap; Uncle said, \"You have a trap, too, haven't you.\" Not a word  did any of the men say and when Uncle asked them who they were and  where they lived, one of them said that they did not intend to steal  the bear but were going to take it to the first house and leave it  for us.    Uncle told them that we did not care to have the bear go in that  direction and told the men they must take the bear to our camp and  their intentions were to steal the bear and trap and that they had  better settle the matter at once. The men were ready to settle and  asked what it would cost and Uncle told them if they would take the  bear to our camp and then leave the woods and not be caught in that  section again, that he would let them go. This they readily consented  to do and insisted that we take a part of a cheese they had brought  in with them. Uncle told them that we did not care for their cheese  or anything else they had--all that we wanted was that they take the  bear to our camp and get out of the woods. This they did and one of  them also took the cheese along and left it at the camp. Then they  left, begging that we would not say anything farther about the  matter.    We learned that the men did not live down the creek but instead lived  in New York State. They had come for a few days' deer hunting and had  only made a shelter of hemlock boughs. The first day out they ran  across the bear and as it was snowing they thought it would snow  enough to cover up their tracks and they would take the bear and get  back to New York State. Well, they did get back but it happened they  left the bear behind.    I would like to ask the old liners who have grown too old on the  trail and trap line to follow it longer with profit and pleasure, if  they keep bees? I find it a great pleasure to watch these little,  industrious and intelligent fellows work.        CHAPTER V.    Some Early Experiences (Concluded.)    I will state that I began my career as a trapper and hunter at a very  early age. The woods extended to the very door of my father's house  and deer were more numerous than sheep in the fields at the present  day. Bear were also quite plentiful and wolves were to be found in  considerable numbers in certain localities. Panthers were much talked  of and occasionally one would be killed by some hunter or trapper of  which I will speak later.    It was not long before I found my way further up the stream into the  woods where mink and coon tracks were in real paths, and here was  where father taught me how to make the deadfall, which was the trap  principally used in those days.    The guns that father had were one double barrel shotgun and a single  barrel rifle, both flintlocks, and with much anxiety I watched those  guns and begged of the older members of the family to let me shoot  the gun but mother was ever on the watch to see that I was not  allowed to handle the guns.

Their features are gone, and though in their attitudes  there is power, and there is something that awakens awe, they are more  wonderful as a far-off feature of the plain. They gain in grandeur from  the night in strangeness from the moonrise, perhaps specially when the  Nile comes to their feet. More than three thousand years old, they look  less eternal than the Sphinx. Like them, the Sphinx is waiting, but with  a greater purpose. The Sphinx reduces man really to nothingness. The  Colossi leave him some remnants of individuality. One can conceive of  Strabo and AElius Gallus, of Hadrian and Sabina, of others who came  over the sunlit land to hear the unearthly song in the dawn, being of  some--not much, but still of some--importance here. Before the Sphinx  no one is important. But in the distance of the plain the Colossi shed  a real magic of calm and solemn personality, and subtly seem to mingle  their spirit with the flat, green world, so wide, so still, so fecund,  and so peaceful; with the soft airs that are surely scented with an  eternal springtime, and with the light that the morning rains down on  wheat and clover, on Indian corn and barley, and on brown men laboring,  who, perhaps, from the patience of the Colossi in repose have drawn a  patience in labor that has in it something not less sublime.    From the Colossi one goes onward toward the trees and the mountains, and  very soon one comes to the edge of that strange and fascinating strip of  barren land which is strewn with temples and honeycombed with tombs. The  sun burns down on it. The heat seems thrown back upon it by the wall of  tawny mountains that bounds it on the west. It is dusty, it is arid; it  is haunted by swarms of flies, by the guardians of the ruins, and by men  and boys trying to sell enormous scarabs and necklaces and amulets, made  yesterday, and the day before, in the manufactory of Kurna. From many  points it looks not unlike a strangely prolonged rubbish-heap in which  busy giants have been digging with huge spades, making mounds and pits,  caverns and trenches, piling up here a monstrous heap of stones, casting  down there a mighty statue. But how it fascinates! Of curse one knows  what it means. One knows that on this strip of land Naville dug out at  Deir-el-Bahari the temple of Mentu-hotep, and discovered later, in her  shrine, Hathor, the cow-goddess, with the lotus-plants streaming from  her sacred forehead to her feet; that long before him Mariette here  brought to the light at Drah-abu'l-Neggah the treasures of kings of  the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties; that at the foot of those  tiger-colored precipices Theodore M. Davis the American found the  sepulcher of Queen Hatshepsu, the Queen Elizabeth of the old Egyptian  world, and, later, the tomb of Yuaa and Thuaa, the parents of Queen  Thiy, containing mummy-cases covered with gold, jars of oil and wine,  gold, silver, and alabaster boxes, a bed decorated with gilded ivory a  chair with gilded plaster reliefs, chairs of state, and a chariot; that  here Maspero, Victor Loret, Brugsch Bey, and other patient workers gave  to the world tombs that had been hidden and unknown for centuries; that  there to the north is the temple of Kurna, and over there the Ramesseum;  that those rows of little pillars close under the mountain, and looking  strangely modern, are the pillars of Hatshepsu's temple, which bears  upon its walls the pictures of the expedition to the historic land of  Punt; that the kings were buried there, and there the queens and the  princes of the vanished dynasties; that beyond to the west is the temple  of Deir-el-Medinet with its judgment of the dead; that here by the  native village is Medinet-Abu. One knows that, and so the imagination is  awake, ready to paint the lily and to gild the beaten gold. But even  if one did not know, I think one would be fascinated. This turmoil of  sun-baked earth and rock, grey, yellow, pink, orange, and red, awakens  the curiosity, summons the love of the strange, suggests that it holds  secrets to charm the souls of men.          X    MEDINET-ABU    At the entrance to the temple of Medinet-Abu, near the small groups  of palms and the few brown houses, often have I turned and looked back  across the plain before entering through the first beautiful doorway,  to see the patient backs and right sides of the Colossi, the far-off,  dreamy mountains beyond Karnak and the Nile. And again, when I have  entered and walked a little distance, I have looked back at the almost  magical picture framed in the doorway; at the bottom of the picture  a layer of brown earth, then a strip of sharp green--the cultivated  ground--then a blur of pale yellow, then a darkness of trees, and just  the hint of a hill far, very far away. And always, in looking, I have  thought of the \"Sposalizio\" of Raphael in the Brera at Milan, of the  tiny dream of blue country framed by the temple doorway beyond the  Virgin and Saint Joseph. The doorways of the temples of Egypt are very  noble, and nowhere have I been more struck by their nobility than in  Medinet-Abu. Set in huge walls of massive masonry, which rise slightly  above them on each side, with a projecting cornice, in their simplicity  they look extraordinarily classical, in their sobriety mysterious,  and in their great solidity quite wonderfully elegant. And they always  suggest to me that they are giving access to courts and chambers which  still, even in our times, are dedicated to secret cults--to the cults of  Isis, of Hathor, and of Osiris.    Close to the right of the front of Medinet-Abu there are trees covered  with yellow flowers; beyond are fields of doura. Behind the temple is  a sterility which makes one think of metal. A great calm enfolds the  place. The buildings are of the same color as the Colossi. When I speak  of the buildings, I include the great temple, the pavilion of Rameses  III., and the little temple, which together may be said to form  Medinet-Abu. Whereas the temple of Luxor seems to open its arms to  life, and the great fascination of the Ramesseum comes partly from its  invasion by every traveling air and happy sun-ray, its openness and  freedom, Medinet-Abu impresses by its colossal air of secrecy, by its  fortress-like seclusion. Its walls are immensely thick, and are covered  with figures the same color as the walls, some of them very tall.  Thick-set, massive, heavy, almost warlike it is. Two seated statues  within, statues with animals' faces, steel-colored, or perhaps a little  darker than that, look like savage warders ready to repel intrusion.    Passing between them, delicately as Agag, one enters an open space with  ruins, upon the right of which is a low, small temple, grey in hue, and  covered with inscriptions, which looks almost bowed under its tremendous  weight of years. From this dignified, though tiny, veteran there comes a  perpetual sound of birds. The birds in Egypt have no reverence for age.  Never have I seen them more restless, more gay, or more impertinent,  than in the immemorial ruins of the ancient land. Beyond is an enormous  portal, on the lofty ceiling of which still linger traces of faded  red and blue, which gives access to a great hall with rows of mighty  columns, those on the left hand round, those on the right square, and  almost terribly massive. There is in these no grace, as in the giant  lotus columns of Karnak. Prodigious, heavy, barbaric, they are like a  hymn in stone to Strength. There is something brutal in their aspect,  which again makes one think of war, of assaults repelled, hordes beaten  back like waves by a sea-wall. And still another great hall, with more  gigantic columns, lies in the sun beyond, and a doorway through which  seems to stare fiercely the edge of a hard and fiery mountain. Although  one is roofed by the sky, there is something oppressive here; an  imprisoned feeling comes over one. I could never be fond of Medinet-Abu,  as I am fond of Luxor, of parts of Karnak, of the whole of delicious,  poetical Philae. The big pylons, with their great walls sloping  inward, sand-colored, and glowing with very pale yellow in the sun, the  resistant walls, the brutal columns, the huge and almost savage scale  of everything, always remind me of the violence in men, and also--I  scarcely know why--make me think of the North, of sullen Northern  castles by the sea, in places where skies are grey, and the white of  foam and snow is married in angry nights.    And yet in Medinet-Abu there reigns a splendid calm--a calm that  sometimes seems massive, resistant, as the columns and the walls. Peace  is certainly inclosed by the stones that call up thoughts of war, as if,  perhaps, their purpose had been achieved many centuries ago, and  they were quit of enemies for ever. Rameses III. is connected with  Medinet-Abu. He was one of the greatest of the Egyptian kings, and has  been called the \"last of the great sovereigns of Egypt.\" He ruled for  thirty-one years, and when, after a first visit to Medinet-Abu, I looked  into his records, I was interested to find that his conquests and his  wars had \"a character essentially defensive.\" This defensive spirit is  incarnated in the stones of these ruins. One reads in them something of  the soul of this king who lived twelve hundred years before Christ, and  who desired, \"in remembrance of his Syrian victories,\" to give to his  memorial temple an outward military aspect. I noticed a military aspect  at once inside this temple; but if you circle the buildings outside it  is more unmistakable. For the east front has a battlemented wall, and  the battlements are shield-shaped. This fortress, or migdol, a name  which the ancient Egyptians borrowed from the nomadic tribes of Syria,  is called the \"Pavilion of Rameses III.,\" and his principal battles are  represented upon its walls. The monarch does not hesitate to speak of  himself in terms of praise, suggesting"]]]
