Of this  he had the first tidings in his letters by the mail of that afternoon.  John Coram, his brother, had written to him, and had said that he  enclosed for his amusement the Japanese bill of particulars, as it had  been drawn out, on which they had founded their orders for the first  assorted cargo ever to be sent from America to Edomo. Bill of  particulars there was, stretching down the long tissue-paper in  exquisite chirography. But by some freak of the \"total depravity of  things,\" the translated order for the assorted cargo was not there. John  Coram, in his care to fold up the Japanese writing nicely, had left on  his own desk at Shanghae the more intelligible English. \"And so I must  wait,\" said Tom philosophically, \"till the next East India mail for my  orders, certain that seven English houses have had less enthusiastic and  philological correspondents than my brother.\"    I said I did not see that. That I could not teach him to speak the  Taghalian dialects so well, that he could read them with facility before  Saturday. But I could do a good deal better. Did he remember writing a  note to old Jack Percival for me five years ago? No, he remembered no  such thing; he knew Jack Percival, but never wrote a note to him in his  life. Did he remember giving me fifty dollars, because I had taken a  delicate boy, whom I was going to send to sea, and I was not quite  satisfied with the government outfit? No, he did not remember that,  which was not strange, for that was a thing he was doing every day.  \"Well, I don't care how much you remember, but the boy about whom you  wrote to Jack Percival, for whose mother's ease of mind you provided the  half-hundred, is back again,--strong, straight, and well; what is more  to the point, he had the whole charge of Perry's commissariat on shore  at Yokohama, was honorably discharged out there, reads Japanese better  than you read English; and if it will help you at all, he shall be here  at your house at breakfast.\" For as I spoke we stopped at Coram's door.  \"Ingham,\" said Coram, \"if you were not a parson, I should say you were  romancing.\" \"My child,\" said I, \"I sometimes write a parable for the  Atlantic; but the words of my lips are verity, as all those of the  Sandemanians. Go to bed; do not even dream of the Taghalian dialects; be  sure that the Japanese interpreter will breakfast with you, and the next  time you are in a scrape send for the nearest minister. George, tell  your brother Ezra that Mr. Coram wishes him to breakfast here to-morrow  morning at eight o'clock; don't forget the number, Pemberton Square, you  know.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said George; and Thomas Coram laughed, said \"Merry  Christmas,\" and we parted.    It was time we were all in bed, especially these boys. But glad  enough am I as I write these words that the meeting of Coram set us  back that dropped-stitch in our night's journey. There was one more  delay. We were sweeping by the Old State House, the boys singing  again, \"Carol, carol, Christians,\" as we dashed along the still  streets, when I caught sight of Adams Todd, and he recognized me. He  had heard us singing when we were at the Advertiser office. Todd is  an old fellow-apprentice of mine,--and he is now, or rather was that  night, chief pressman in the Argus office. I like the Argus  people,--it was there that I was South American Editor, now many  years ago,--and they befriend me to this hour. Todd hailed me, and  once more I stopped. \"What sent you out from your warm steam-boiler?\"  \"Steam-boiler, indeed,\" said Todd. \"Two rivets loose,--steam-room  full of steam,--police frightened,--neighborhood in a row,--and we  had to put out the fire. She would have run a week without hurting a  fly,--only a little puff in the street sometimes. But there we are,  Ingham. We shall lose the early mail as it stands. Seventy-eight  tokens to be worked now.\" They always talked largely of their edition  at the Argus. Saw it with many eyes, perhaps; but this time, I am  sure, Todd spoke true. I caught his idea at once. In younger and more  muscular times, Todd and I had worked the Adams press by that  fly-wheel for full five minutes at a time, as a test of strength; and  in my mind's eye, I saw that he was printing his paper at this moment  with relays of grinding stevedores. He said it was so. \"But think of  it to-night,\" said he. \"It is Christmas eve, and not an Irishman to  be hired, though one paid him ingots. Not a man can stand the grind  ten minutes.\" I knew that very well from old experience, and I  thanked him inwardly for not saying \"the demnition grind,\" with  Mantilini. \"We cannot run the press half the time,\" said he; \"and the  men we have are giving out now. We shall lose all our carrier  delivery.\" \"Todd,\" said I, \"is this a night to be talking of ingots,  or hiring, or losing, or gaining? When will you learn that Love rules  the court, the camp, and the Argus office.\" And I wrote on the back  of a letter to Campbell: \"Come to the Argus office, No. 2 Dassett's  Alley, with seven men not afraid to work\"; and I gave it to John and  Sam, bade Howland take the boys to Campbell's house,--walked down  with Todd to his office,--challenged him to take five minutes at the  wheel, in memory of old times,--made the tired relays laugh as they  saw us take hold; and then,--when I had cooled off, and put on my  Cardigan,--met Campbell, with his seven sons of Anak, tumbling down  the stairs, wondering what round of mercy the parson had found for  them this time. I started home, knowing I should now have my Argus  with my coffee.      III.    And so I walked home. Better so, perhaps, after all, than in the lively  sleigh, with the tinkling bells.        \"It was a calm and silent night!--        Seven hundred years and fifty-three      Had Rome been growing up to might,        And now was queen of land and sea!      No sound was heard of clashing wars,--        Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain;      Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars        Held undisturbed their ancient reign          In the solemn midnight,            Centuries ago!\"    What an eternity it seemed since I started with those children singing  carols. Bethlehem, Nazareth, Calvary, Rome, Roman senators, Tiberius,  Paul, Nero, Clement, Ephrem, Ambrose, and all the singers,--Vincent de  Paul, and all the loving wonder-workers, Milton and Herbert and all the  carol-writers, Luther and Knox and all the prophets,--what a world of  people had been keeping Christmas with Sam Perry and Lycidas and Harry  and me; and here were Yokohama and the Japanese, the Daily Argus and its  ten million tokens and their readers,--poor Fanny Woodhull and her sick  mother there, keeping Christmas too! For a finite world, these are a  good many \"waits\" to be singing in one poor fellow's ears on one  Christmas tide.        \"'Twas in the calm and silent night!--        The senator of haughty Rome,      Impatient urged his chariot's flight,        From lordly revel, rolling home.      Triumphal arches gleaming swell        His breast, with thoughts of boundless sway.      What recked the _Roman_ what befell        A paltry province far away,          In the solemn midnight,            Centuries ago!        \"Within that province far away        Went plodding home a weary boor;      A streak of light before him lay,        Fallen through a half-shut stable door      Across his path. He passed,--for naught        Told _what was going on within_;      How keen the stars, his only thought,        The air how calm and cold and thin,          In the solemn midnight,            Centuries ago!\"    \"Streak of light\"--Is there a light in Lycidas's room? They not in bed!  That is making a night of it! Well, there are few hours of the day or  night when I have not been in Lycidas's room, so I let myself in by the  night-key he gave me, ran up the stairs,--it is a horrid seven-storied,  first-class lodging-house. For my part, I had as lief live in a steeple.  Two flights I ran up, two steps at a time,--I was younger then than I am  now,--pushed open the door which was ajar, and saw such a scene of  confusion as I never saw in Mary's over-nice parlor before. Queer! I  remember the first thing that I saw was wrong was a great ball of white  German worsted on the floor. Her basket was upset. A great  Christmas-tree lay across the rug, quite too high for the room; a large  sharp-pointed Spanish clasp-knife was by it, with which they had been  lopping it; there were two immense baskets of white papered presents,  both upset; but what frightened me most was the centre-table. Three or  four handkerchiefs on it,--towels, napkins, I know not what,--all brown  and red and almost black with blood! I turned, heart-sick, to look into  the bedroom,--and I really had a sense of relief when I saw somebody.  Bad enough it was, however. Lycidas, but just now so strong and well,  lay pale and exhausted on the bloody bed, with the clothing removed from  his right thigh and leg, while over him bent Mary and Morton. I learned  afterwards that poor Lycidas, while trimming the Christmas-tree, and  talking merrily with Mary and Morton,--who, by good luck, had brought  round his presents late, and was staying to tie on glass balls and  apples,--had given himself a deep and dangerous wound with the point of  the unlucky knife, and had lost a great deal of blood before the  hemorrhage could be controlled. Just before I entered, the stick  tourniquet which Morton had improvised had slipped in poor Mary's  unpractised hand, at the moment he was about to secure the bleeding  artery, and the blood followed in such a gush as compelled him to give  his whole attention to stopping its flow. He only knew my entrance by  the \"Ah, Mr. Ingham,\" of the frightened Irish girl, who stood useless  behind the head of the bed.    \"O Fred,\" said Morton, without looking up, \"I am glad you are here.\"    \"And"]]]
