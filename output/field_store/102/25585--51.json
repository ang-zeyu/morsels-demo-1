He held the supreme command of the British armies on the western  front when, in the battlefields of the Somme and Flanders, of Picardy  and Artois, there was not much chance for daring strategy, but only  for hammer-strokes by the flesh and blood of men against fortress  positions--the German trench systems, twenty-five miles deep in tunneled  earthworks and machine-gun dugouts--when the immensity of casualties  among British troops was out of all proportion to their gains of ground,  so that our men's spirits revolted against these massacres of their  youth and they were embittered against the generalship and staff-work  which directed these sacrificial actions.    This sense of bitterness became intense, to the point of fury, so that  a young staff officer, in his red tabs, with a jaunty manner, was like a  red rag to a bull among battalion officers and men, and they desired  his death exceedingly, exalting his little personality, dressed in a  well-cut tunic and fawn-colored riding-breeches and highly polished  top-boots, into the supreme folly of \"the Staff\" which made men attack  impossible positions, send down conflicting orders, issued a litter  of documents--called by an ugly name--containing impracticable  instructions, to the torment of the adjutants and to the scorn of the  troops. This hatred of the Staff was stoked high by the fires of  passion and despair. Some of it was unjust, and even the jaunty young  staff-officer--a G. S. O. 3, with red tabs and polished boots--was often  not quite such a fool as he looked, but a fellow who had proved his  pluck in the early days of the war and was now doing his duty--about  equal to the work of a boy clerk--with real industry and an exaggerated  sense of its importance.    Personally I can pay high tribute to some of our staff--officers at  divisional, corps, and army headquarters, because of their industry,  efficiency, and devotion to duty. And during the progress of battle I  have seen them, hundreds of times, working desperately for long hours  without much rest or sleep, so that the fighting-men should get their  food and munitions, so that the artillery should support their actions,  and the troops in reserve move up to their relief at the proper time and  place.    Owing largely to new army brains the administrative side of our war  became efficient in its method and organization, and the armies were  worked like clockwork machines. The transport was good beyond all words  of praise, and there was one thing which seldom failed to reach poor  old Tommy Atkins, unless he was cut off by shell-fire, and that was his  food. The motor-supply columns and ammunition-dumps were organized to  the last item. Our map department was magnificent, and the admiration  of the French. Our Intelligence branch became valuable (apart from a  frequent insanity of optimism) and was sometimes uncanny in the accuracy  of its information about the enemy's disposition and plans. So that the  Staff was not altogether hopeless in its effect, as the young battalion  officers, with sharp tongues and a sense of injustice in their hearts,  made out, with pardonable blasphemy, in their dugouts.    Nevertheless the system was bad and British generalship made many  mistakes, some of them, no doubt, unavoidable, because it is human to  err, and some of them due to sheer, simple, impregnable stupidity.    In the early days the outstanding fault of our generals was their desire  to gain ground which was utterly worthless when gained. They organized  small attacks against strong positions, dreadfully costly to take,  and after the desperate valor of men had seized a few yards of mangled  earth, found that they had made another small salient, jutting out from  their front in a V-shaped wedge, so that it was a death-trap for the men  who had to hold it. This was done again and again, and I remember one  distinguished officer saying, with bitter irony, remembering how many of  his men had died, \"Our generals must have their little V's at any price,  to justify themselves at G. H. Q.\"    In the battles of the Somme they attacked isolated objectives on  narrow fronts, so that the enemy swept our men with fire by artillery  concentrated from all points, instead of having to disperse his fire  during a general attack on a wide front. In the days of trench warfare,  when the enemy artillery was much stronger than ours, and when his  infantry strength was enormously greater, our generals insisted upon  the British troops maintaining an \"aggressive\" attitude, with the result  that they were shot to pieces, instead of adopting, like the French, a  quiet and waiting attitude until the time came for a sharp and terrible  blow. The battles of Neuve Chapelle, Fertubert, and Loos, in 1915,  cost us thousands of dead and gave us no gain of any account; and both  generalship and staff-work were, in the opinion of most officers who  know anything of those battles, ghastly.    After all, our generals had to learn their lesson, like the private  soldier, and the young battalion officer, in conditions of warfare which  had never been seen before--and it was bad for the private soldier and  the young battalion officer, who died so they might learn. As time  went on staff-work improved, and British generalship was less rash in  optimism and less rigid in ideas.          XVI      General Haldane was friendly to the war correspondents--he had been  something of the kind himself in earlier days--and we were welcomed at  his headquarters, both when he commanded the 3d Division and afterward  when he became commander of the 6th Corps. I thought during the war, and  I think now, that he had more intellect and \"quality\" than many of  our other generals. A tall, strongly built man, with a distinction of  movement and gesture, not \"stocky\" or rigid, but nervous and restless,  he gave one a sense of power and intensity of purpose. There was a  kind of slow-burning fire in him--a hatred of the enemy which was not  weakened in him by any mercy, and a consuming rage, as it appeared to  me, against inefficiency in high places, injustice of which he may have  felt himself to be the victim, and restrictions upon his liberty of  command. A bitter irony was often in his laughter when discussing  politicians at home, and the wider strategy of war apart from that  on his own front. He was intolerant of stupidity, which he found  widespread, and there was no tenderness or emotion in his attitude  toward life. The officers and men under his command accused him of  ruthlessness. But they admitted that he took more personal risk than  he need have done as a divisional general, and was constantly in the  trenches examining his line. They also acknowledged that he was generous  in his praise of their good service, though merciless if he found  fault with them. He held himself aloof--too much, I am sure--from his  battalion officers, and had an extreme haughtiness of bearing which was  partly due to reserve and that shyness which is in many Englishmen and a  few Scots.    In the old salient warfare he often demanded service in the way of raids  and the holding of death-traps, and the execution of minor attacks which  caused many casualties, and filled men with rage and horror at what  they believed to be unnecessary waste of life--their life, and their  comrades'--that did not make for popularity in the ranks of the  battalion messes. Privately, in his own mess, he was gracious to  visitors, and revealed not only a wide range of knowledge outside as  well as inside his profession, but a curious, unexpected sympathy for  ideas, not belonging as a rule to generals of the old caste. I liked  him, though I was always conscious of that flame and steel in his nature  which made his psychology a world away from mine. He was hit hard--in  what I think was the softest spot in his heart--by the death of one of  his A. D. C.'s--young Congreve, who was the beau ideal of knighthood,  wonderfully handsome, elegant even when covered from head to foot in wet  mud (as I saw him one day), fearless, or at least scornful of danger,  to the verge of recklessness. General Haldane had marked him out as  the most promising young soldier in the whole army. A bit of shell, a  senseless bit of steel, spoiled that promise--as it spoiled the promise  of a million boys--and the general was saddened more than by the death  of other gallant officers.    I have one memory of General Haldane which shows him in a different  light. It was during the great German offensive in the north, when Arras  was hard beset and the enemy had come back over Monchy Hill and was  shelling villages on the western side of Arras, which until then  had been undamaged. It was in one of these villages--near  Avesnes-le-Compte--to which the general had come back with his corps  headquarters, established there for many months in earlier days, so that  the peasants and their children knew him well by sight and had talked  with him, because he liked to speak French with them. When I went to see  him one day during that bad time in April of '18, he was surrounded by  a group of children who were asking anxiously whether Arras would be  taken. He drew a map for them in the dust of the roadway, and showed  them where the enemy was attacking and the general strategy. He spoke  simply and gravely, as though to a group of staff-officers, and the  children followed his diagram in the dust and understood him perfectly.    \"They will not take Arras if I can help it,\" he said. \"You will be all  right here.\"          XVII      Gen. Sir Neville Macready was adjutant-general in the days of Sir John  French, and I dined at his mess once or twice, and he came to ours on  return visits. The son of Macready, the actor, he had a subtlety of mind  not common among British generals, to whom \"subtlety\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#9)"],[1,"of hoofs to her forefeet; in fine,  there was nothing left of the heifer except her beauty.  At first  she was afraid to speak for fear she should low, but gradually  she recovered her confidence, and was restored to her father and  sisters.    In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following  allusion to the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:--      \"So did he feel who pulled the boughs aside,    That we might look into a forest wide,    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled    Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.    Poor nymph   poor Pan   how he did weep to find    Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind    Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain,    Full of sweet desolation, balmy pain.\"      CALLISTO    Callisto was another maiden who excited the jealousy of Juno, and  the goddess changed her into a bear.  \"I will take away,\" said  she, :\"that beauty with which you have captivated my husband.\"  Down fell Callisto on her hands and knees; she tried to stretch  out her arms in supplication,-- they were already beginning to be  covered with black hair.  Her hands grew rounded, became armed  with crooked claws, and served for feet; her mouth, which Jove  used to praise for its beauty, became a horrid pair of jaws; her  voice, which if unchanged would have moved the heart to pity,  became a growl, more fit to inspire terror.  Yet her former  disposition remained, and, with continued groaning, she bemoaned  her fate, and stood upright as well as she could, lifting up her  paws to beg for mercy; and felt that Jove was unkind, though she  could not tell him so.  Ah, how often, afraid to stay in the  woods all night alone, she wandered about the neighborhood of her  former haunts; how often, frightened by the dogs, did she, so  lately a huntress, fly in terror from the hunters!  Often she  fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that she was now a wild  beast herself; and, bear as she was, was afraid of the bears.    One day a youth espied her as he was hunting.  She saw him and  recognized him as her own son, now grown a young man.  She  stopped, and felt inclined to embrace him.  As she was about to  approach, he, alarmed, raised his hunting spear, and was on the  point of transfixing her, when Jupiter, beholding, arrested the  crime, and, snatching away both of them, placed them in the  heavens as the Great and Little Bear.    Juno was in a rage to see her rival so set in honor, and hastened  to ancient Tethys and Oceanus, the powers of ocean, and, in  answer to their inquiries, thus told the cause of her coming; \"Do  you ask why I, the queen of the gods, have left the heavenly  plains and sought your depths.  Learn that I am supplanted in  heaven,-- my place is given to another.  You will hardly believe  me; but look when night darkens the world, and you shall see the  two, of whom I have so much reason to complain, exalted to the  heavens, in that part where the circle is the smallest, in the  neighborhood of the pole.  Why should any one hereafter tremble  at the thought of offending Juno, when such rewards are the  consequence of my displeasure!  See what I have been able to  effect!  I forbade her to wear the human form,-- she is placed  among the stars!  So do my punishments result,-- such is the  extent of my power!  Better that she should have resumed her  former shape, as I permitted Io to do.  Perhaps he means to marry  her, and put me away!  But you, my foster parents, if you feel  for me, and see with displeasure this unworthy treatment of me,  show it, I beseech you, by forbidding this guilty couple from  coming into your waters.\"  The powers of the ocean assented, and  consequently the two constellations of the Great and Little Bear  move round and round in heaven, but never sink, as the other  stars do, beneath the ocean.    Milton alludes to the fact that the constellation of the Bear  never sets, when he says,      \"Let my lamp at midnight hour    Be seen in some high lonely tower,    Where I may oft outwatch the Bear.\"    Il Penseroso    And Prometheus, in James Russell Lowell's poem, says,    \"One after one the stars have risen and set,  Sparkling upon the hoar-frost of my chain;  The Bear that prowled all night about the fold  Of the North Star, hath shrunk into his den,  Scared by the blithsome footsteps of the dawn.\"    The last star in the tail of the Little Bear is the Pole star,  called also the Cynosure.  Milton says,      \"Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures    While the landscape round it measures.    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    Towers and battlements it sees    Bosomed high in tufted trees,    Where perhaps some beauty lies    The Cynosure of neighboring eyes.\"    L'Allegro.    The reference here is both to the Pole-star as the guide of  mariners, and to the magnetic attraction of the North.  He calls  it also the \"Star of Aready,\" because Callisto's boy was named  Arcas, and they lived in Arcadia.  In Milton's Comus, the elder  brother, benighted in the woods, says,      \"Some gentle taper!    Through a rush candle, from    the wicker hole    Of some clay habitation,      visit us    With thy long levelled rule      of streaming light,    And thou shalt be our star of Aready,    Or Tyrian Chynsure.\"      DIANA AND ACTAEON    It was midday, and the sun stood equally distant from either  goal, when young Actaeon, son of King Cadmus, thus addressed the  youths who with him were hunting the stag in the mountains:--    \"Friends, our nets and our weapons are wet with the blood of our  victims; we have had sport enough for one day, and tomorrow we  can renew our labors.  Now, while Phoebus parches the earth, let  us put by our instruments and indulge ourselves with rest.\"    There was a valley thickly enclosed with cypresses and pines,  sacred to the huntress-queen, Diana.  In the extremity of the  valley was a cave, not adorned with art, but nature had  counterfeited art in its construction, for she had turned the  arch of its roof with stones as delicately fitted as if by the  hand of man.  A fountain burst out from one side, whose open  basin was bounded by a grassy rim.  Here the goddess of the woods  used to come when weary with hunting and lave her virgin limbs in  the sparkling water.    One day, having repaired thither with her nymphs, she handed her  javelin, her quiver, and her bow to one, her robe to another,  while a third unbound the sandals from her feet.  Then Crocale,  the most skilful of them, arranged her hair, and Nephele, Hyale,  and the rest drew water in capacious urns.  While the goddess was  thus employed in the labors of the toilet, behold, Actaeon,  having quitted his companions, and rambling without any especial  object, came to the place, led thither by his destiny.  As he  presented himself at the entrance of the cave, the nymphs, seeing  a man, screamed and rushed towards the goddess to hide her with  their bodies.  But she was taller than the rest, and overtopped  them all by a head.  Such a color as tinges the clouds at sunset  or at dawn came over the countenance of Diana thus taken by  surprise.  Surrounded as she was by her nymphs, she yet turned  half away, and sought with a sudden impulse for her arrows.  As  they were not at hand, she dashed the water into the face of the  intruder, adding these words: \"Now go and tell, if you can, that  you have seen Diana unapparelled.\"  Immediately a pair of  branching stag's horns grew out of his head, his neck gained in  length, his ears grew sharp-pointed, his hands became feet, his  arms long legs, his body was covered with a hairy spotted hide.  Fear took the place of his former boldness, and the hero fled.  He could not but admire his own speed; but when he saw his horns  in the water, \"Ah, wretched me!: he would have said, but no sound  followed the effort.  He groaned, and tears flowed down the face  that had taken the place of his own.  Yet his consciousness  remained.  What shall he do?   Go home to seek the palace, or lie  hid in the woods?  The latter he was afraid, the former he was  ashamed, to do.  While he hesitated the dogs saw him.  First  Melampus, a Spartan dog, gave the signal with his bark, then  Pamphagus, Dorceus, Lelaps, Theron, Nape, Tigris, and all the  rest, rushed after him swifter than the wind.  Over rocks and  cliffs, through mountain gorges that seemed impracticable, he  fled, and they followed.  Where he had often chased the stag and  cheered on his pack, his pack now chased him, cheered on by his  own huntsmen.  He longed to cry out, \"I am Actaeon; recognize  your master!\"  But the words came not at his will.  The air  resounded with the bark of the dogs.  Presently one fastened on  his back, another seized his shoulder.  While they held their  master, the rest of the pack came up and buried their teeth in  his flesh.  He groaned,   not in a human voice, yet certainly not  in a stag's,   and, falling on his knees, raised his eyes, and  would have raised his arms in supplication, if he had had them.  His friends and fellow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and looked  every where for Actaeon, calling on him to join the sport.  At  the sound of his name, he turned his head, and heard them regret  that he should be away.  He earnestly wished he was.  He would  have been well pleased to see the exploits of his dogs, but to  feel them was too much.  They were all around him, rending and  tearing; and it was not till they had torn his life out that the  anger of Diana was satisfied.    In the \"Epic of Hades\" there is a description of Actaeon and his  change of form.  Perhaps the most beautiful lines in it are when  Actaeon, changed to a stag, first hears his own hounds and flees.      \"But as I gazed, and careless turned and passed    Through the thick wood, forgetting what had been,    And thinking thoughts no longer, swift there came    A mortal terror; voices that I knew.    My own hounds' bayings that"]]]
