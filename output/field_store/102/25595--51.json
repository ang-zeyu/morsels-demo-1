They are very fond of poultry and  frequently visit the poultry houses, killing the young birds. They also  feed on carrion. When they can get it they will eat almost any kind of  animal food. Even in the wild state the skunk is not, strictly speaking,  a carnivorous animal as they will eat and in fact are fond of sweet corn  when in a milky state, also sweet potatoes, melons and wild fruits.    They have no means of defense other than their scent, but this is  sufficient in many cases and the majority of people will give them a  wide berth. This scent is only used when alarmed or frightened and in  captivity there is no trouble whatever from this source as they soon  learn that there is no occasion for alarm and become quite tame.    PAST EXPERIMENTS.--Beyond all doubt the skunk has been given more  consideration by raisers of fur-bearers than any other animal, with the  exception of the fox. There are many who have tried raising these  animals with more or less success and where the experimenters have used  good judgment and have given the subject all of the attention it  deserves, they have been reasonably successful. Most of these people  have started in on a small scale, having perhaps only a dozen or two of  skunks to start with; in fact, nowhere has the business been carried on  as extensively as some newspaper articles would lead one to believe; the  majority of these parties having at the most only two or three hundred  animals. One of the largest ranches was located in Eastern Pennsylvania,  but for various reasons this venture was a failure.    It is the smaller experimenters, in other words, those who have begun on  a small scale, who have been most successful. They are for the most part  trappers who had even before venturing into the business a fair  knowledge of the nature and habits of the skunk and therefore were more  qualified for making the business a successful one. Trappers naturally  take an interest in all nature and are most likely to give the proper  amount of attention to the animals, also learn their habits readily and  act accordingly and these qualities are absolutely necessary for the  successful raising of all fur-bearing animals.    The most successful stock breeders are those who make a special study of  their animals and take a great interest in them and those who do not are  almost certain to fail and really deserve failure. If so much care is  necessary in breeding domestic animals, how much more important the care  in handling the wild creatures, knowing so little of them as the average  man does. But even handicapped by lack of knowledge the experimenters  have been fairly successful from the start if they were the right men  for the business. Without exception they all report that the animals  breed well in captivity and are easily kept; in a short time becoming  quite tame and losing their fear of man.    The skunk is an animal which is despised and feared by many people  because of its readiness to make use of its powerful scent, the only  means of defense with which nature has provided it, but it is only when  frightened that it uses this scent and once they have become tame and  learn that they will not be harmed they are practically harmless. We  will say, however, to those who are afraid of the scent do not attempt  to raise skunks, but devote your time to some other calling for which  you are more fitted.    It is true that the scent glands may be removed from the young animals  but many of them will die from the operation and there is practically  nothing gained; therefore, this practice is not advised.    Those who have failed were for the most part people who knew nothing  regarding the habits of the animal and its care when in captivity. They  were men with capital, who began on a large scale expecting to make a  fortune in a short time, but in this they were mistaken, for many of  them lost all that they invested. These parties have had trouble from  the older animals killing and eating the young, also from depredations  of owls, but mainly from the first reason. It is our opinion that this  cannibalistic tendency is caused by improper feeding, as those parties  who have used care in that respect have had no trouble whatever.    To those who are thinking of embarking in the business of skunk farming,  we would say,--start on a small scale with only a small number of  animals, say two dozen females and six males. Give them every possible  attention and study them under all conditions. Do not expect to make a  fortune in a short time.    ENCLOSURES.--After you have decided on this business the first thing is  to find the proper location and make a suitable enclosure. There should  be a spring on, or a small stream crossing the ground to be inclosed,  but at the same time the ground must not be wet; in fact, it should be  of rather dry nature, so that there will not be too much dampness in the  dens. There should be banks of earth for the animals to den in and the  ground should have a gradual slope so that it will drain readily. If it  is of a sandy nature it will be all the better. Some who have tried  skunk farming have located the yards on the shore of a small lake or  pond and have included a portion of the pond in the enclosure. This is a  good idea and it will not be necessary to extend the fence very deep  into the water, as the skunk is not a water animal and will not dive  under; however, where the fence crosses a stream of running water the  fence should reach to the bed of the stream as the water will fall  considerably during dry weather.    The enclosures should be large. When the animals are inclosed in small  yards or pens they become infested with fleas, ticks, etc., and they do  not do well. Such small enclosures will answer for a short time but as  soon as possible they should be placed in a large roomy yard. For  fencing material, galvanized wire netting of one-inch mesh is advised,  as the young animals will escape through a two-inch mesh. The fence  should be seven feet in height. Under ordinary conditions the skunk  would not escape over a four-foot fence, but there is danger in winter  from drifting snow, and dogs and other animals must be kept out at all  times; therefore, the fence should be of the height mentioned and it  must be turned in at the top or a sheet of tin placed along the edge to  prevent the animals from climbing out.    [Illustration: Corner of an Ohio Skunk Farm.]    The interior of the enclosure should be divided into compartments, using  the same material for the fences but they need not be so high. The  largest compartment would be for the females and there should be a  smaller one for the males, also one for the young animals after they  have become large enough to take care of themselves. Some also make  small yards in which to place the females, two or three together, after  the young animals are born. The most of those who have tried skunk  breeding, however, have not found this necessary, but there should  always be a separate enclosure for the males. When the number of animals  increases it will be necessary to have a few small breeding yards, large  enough for ten or twelve animals. One need not, however, make such an  elaborate enclosure in the start but can enlarge it as needed, adding  more compartments.    In each compartment a number of dens should be made by digging a trench  and covering afterwards. While the animals will dig dens if necessary,  they prefer even while in a wild state to use dens already made. Boxes,  barrels or pens with board floors should not be used. Some of the  successful ones claim that this has a tendency to cause a thick pelt and  thin fur and say that it is absolutely necessary that they have natural  dens in the ground. The dens should be made quite deep so that there  will be no danger from frost in winter.    FEEDING.--Skunks should have plenty of food especially during the summer  and they should be fed at regular intervals, giving just enough for a  meal each time. It is advisable to give a mixed diet, partly animal and  partly vegetable. They will eat almost all kinds of flesh and fish,  table scraps, fruits, especially if very ripe, melons, sweet potatoes,  berries, etc. One of the most satisfactory foods is bread and milk, but  it is considered too expensive by some people. However, it could be  given occasionally. They are very fond of carrion, but such food should  not be given, for it is likely to cause disease. If near a slaughter  house one can get plenty of offal and in the country one can buy old,  worn-out horses, etc., but one should remember that the skunk will  consume an amazing amount of food. One party claims that three hundred  skunk will eat two horses in a week. In the fall especially, when they  are laying on fat for winter, they should have plenty of food. In  winter they do not require so much.    It should be remembered that it is a lack of food that causes them to  eat their young and one should feed well during the spring and summer.    Skunks feed largely on insects, grubs, etc., and it is to be regretted  that one can not supply this food. They are fond of eggs, either fresh  or spoiled, and should be given a feed of this kind occasionally if  possible. They also have a fondness for poultry of all kinds.    The matter of providing sufficient food is not as difficult as it would  appear at first glance. If the farm is located near a large town or  city, hotel and restaurant keepers will generally save table scraps,  stale bread, etc., on request, if one will make a regular habit of  calling for it. Even in the country the neighbors will help out. The  farmers will be only too glad to have you take the dead stock, poultry,  etc., thus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#9)"],[1,"a groove  planed down the middle, and with care will answer pretty well; but the  corked board is far preferable.    The mode of \"setting\" the insect with card \"braces\" transfixed with pins,  which retain the wings in their proper position, will be also readily seen  by reference to the figure.    A great point in \"setting\" is to take care that all the wings are  symmetrically arranged, or diverging from the body at equal angles on each  side. Let the _antennae_ also be carefully preserved, as on their integrity  much of the specimen's value depends.    It will be needless to say that any handling of the _wings_ is to be  avoided, as a touch will sometimes destroy their bloom.    The setting-board, when filled, should be put away into a secure,  dust-proof, and dry place; and in a few days, more or less, according to  the dryness or otherwise of the atmosphere, the butterflies will have dried  and set in their positions, and are then ready for transference to the  store-box or cabinet.    The choice of this receptacle is a serious question for the beginner, who  is often in want of a guide to the judicious expenditure of his money, if  money he means {56} to spend in this pursuit. To preserve insects, it is  _not_ absolutely necessary to have either a cabinet or the regularly-made  store-boxes; for, with a little contrivance, any close-shutting, shallow  box may be extemporized into a store-box. The bottom may either be lined  with sheet-cork (such as is used by shoemakers)--which, however, is a  rather dear commodity--or common wine-corks may be sliced up, and cut into  little square patches that may be attached in straight rows to the bottom  of the box with strong gum or other cement. The first specimens, the  nucleus of the future great collection, can be kept here well enough, till  a real cabinet can be compassed.    A cabinet, however, need not be bought all at once; it may be arranged to  grow with the collection--and, it may be, with the collector too--by having  one or two drawers made at a time; till, in course of time, a sufficient  number is obtained, when the whole may be fitted into a case at a small  additional expense, and then there is a first-rate cabinet complete; for,  to make this plan really advantageous, the drawers should be well made and  of good material. Of course, all the drawers must be made to the same  \"gauge,\" to insure perfect fitting when the cabinet is made up.    These drawers may be made by any clever joiner, but as their construction  is peculiar, and not easily described, it is necessary, either that the  maker should be accustomed to this speciality, or that he be furnished with  a pattern, either by buying a single drawer at a dealer's, {57} where that  can be done, by borrowing one out of a friend's cabinet, or by making  therefrom a good working drawing (in section, &c.).    The glasses which cover in the drawers should always have separate frames  for the more perfect exclusion of dust and mites.    Well seasoned mahogany or deal may be the material for the drawers, but on  no account let them be of cedar, a material often used by ignorant or  unprincipled makers, to the great detriment of the collection, and  mortification of the collector, as resinous matter after a short time  exudes from the pores of this wood, dropping down on to the glasses below  in a gummy shower, and the effluvium seems to condense upon the contained  insects, whose wings are gradually discoloured and disfigured by greasy  looking blotches. The drawers are lined at bottom with cork, covered with  _pure white_ paper, which should be attached with _thin_ paste.    The butterflies are then to be arranged in the drawers in perpendicular  columns, and in accordance with some system of classification. If there be  room it is well to have a considerable number of specimens of each species,  especially when it is one liable to much variation. At least one of each  sex should always be given, and also one of each sex showing the _under_  surface. When the chrysalis can be procured, that also should be pinned  down with its fellow-butterfly, and a good coloured drawing of each  caterpillar would be a valuable addition to the series. Between the  columns, lines should be {58} ruled varying in distance according to the  breadth of the butterflies, and small labels should be pinned down at the  foot of each species giving its _specific_ name; the name of the genus  being placed at the head of the _first_ species of the genus. The names of  the families and sub-families under which the _genera_ are classed are also  generally given in their respective places.    I have in this little work followed the system of classification used in  the _public_ collection of British butterflies at the British Museum, which  seemed to me more intelligible and natural when applied to our very limited  number of butterflies, than did the system of Doubleday adopted in the  great world-wide collection which exists in the private entomological room  of the British Museum.

It will be seen by the above list that seventy species are given as  British. Of these, five species, viz. _Papilio Podalirius_, _Erebia Ligea_,  _Argynnis Dia_, _Chrysophanus Chryseis_, and _Polyommatus Boeticus_, have  been so rarely taken as to be refused a place among the _regular_ denizens  of our island. So that we can only reckon up the small number of  _sixty-five species of true British butterflies_.    These it now remains to describe individually, but, prior to entering on  that task, I would say a few words {60} on the acquirement of scientific  nomenclature and systematic arrangement, a knowledge of which will  facilitate even our recreations in natural history, while it is absolutely  essential to carrying out the really scientific study of any department.    It is true, that the painting of a butterfly and the fragrance of a flower  can give deep pleasure to a mind quite unconscious of their Latin names,  their genus, order, or anything of the kind; but the interest of natural  objects is, I am sure, greatly augmented when we acquire some insight,  however dimly, into the wonderful mechanism of creation's plan, its  infinite gradation of forms, and their curious, subtle relationships, to  which a _good_ system of classification serves, in some degree, as an  index. I say, \"_in some degree_,\" as a system framed in perfect accordance  with that of nature is a discovery rather to be desired than hoped for,  with the limited knowledge at present permitted to us.    Though these Latin names are generally considered as unwelcome excrescences  on the pages of _popular_ natural history works, I would yet advise the  young entomologist to master them for once, and accustom himself well to  their use. He will not find the task a very difficult one, if I may judge  from the repeated instances in which I have heard the almost infantile  progeny of my naturalist friends glibly mouthing these redoubtable words,  and applying them with the most precise accuracy.    Among collectors it is customary in familiar {61} conversation to use only  the second, or _specific_ name of the insect's Latin title; thus, in  speaking of the common Swallow-tailed Butterfly, they call it \"_Machaon_\"  only, which at once distinguishes the one they mean from the other, or  scarce Swallow-tailed Butterfly, which they would speak of as  \"_Podalirius_.\" The Pearl-bordered Likeness Fritillary may be called  \"_Athalia_,\" and so on. I think it will be allowed that these Latin names  are not harder to learn, remember, or pronounce, than the long-winded  English titles; and, when acquired, bring their possessor the advantage of  being able to converse with precision on their subject"]]]
