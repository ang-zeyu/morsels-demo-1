Its bigness is no  criterion of its goodness. The fact that it is the best work of the best  years of Mrs. Rorer's life; that it is a complete new book telling of  the things one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and the  easiest and best way of housekeeping--these are what make for goodness,  and place this book far in advance of any other of a like nature.    The New Cook Book covers all departments of cookery. A masterly  exposition of each subject is given, followed by recipes for the proper  preparation, cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods. There  are over 1500 recipes in the book.    The illustrations are an important feature. One set of pictures shows  the proper dressing of the table during a course dinner. Then there is a  complete set showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game, etc.;  and many others illustrating special features of the book.    Large 12mo, 731 pages, profusely and beautifully illustrated; bound in  cloth, $2.00 net; by mail, $2.20      =Mrs. Rorer's Philadelphia Cook Book=    This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has been before the  public for a number of years. It has no connection with Mrs. Rorer's New  Cook Book. Each book is independent of the other, and the possession of  one forms no reason for doing without the other.    The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things, and, like all of Mrs.  Rorer's works, is eminently practical. It is a standard of excellence,  in that it is full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes are  absolutely reliable, and the general instructions to housekeepers of the  most helpful and necessary character.    Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and experience on the part  of those who use them, but Mrs. Rorer makes her explanations so clear,  and gives such definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner  has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the book calls for.  Then there are frequent hints as to the proper use of left-overs, how to  market, and, in many ways, information is given that is alike useful to  the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary.    The book is full of choice recipes, every one of which has been  successfully tested by Mrs. Rorer and found to come out right. This  alone is of incalculable benefit and ought to commend the book to the  favorable consideration of every housekeeper.    The use of this book in the home means better health, better living,  economy in the use of food, and a consequent saving in dollars and  cents.    12mo, nearly 600 pages, with portrait of author; bound in cloth, $1.00  net; by mail, $1.15      =Mrs. Rorer's Vegetable Cookery and Meat Substitutes=    This book has a twofold object:      1. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to diet and    health, how to prepare, cook and serve them, what to eat under certain    conditions of health, and thus have them perform their proper work.      2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of combinations of    foods in the shape of toothsome recipes to take the place of meat, or    as we call them--Meat Substitutes.    It goes without saying that we all know too little about the value of  vegetables as food. We eat them because they are palatable, not  realizing their immense importance as body builders. Here they are  classified, and thus made to give us a right idea of their use.    Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary to be a vegetarian to  desire a change from a meat diet. There are health reasons often  demanding abstention from meats; or economy may be an impelling motive;  or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of fare may be  warrant enough. However we look at it here is the wonder book to point  the way to better and healthier living.    There is an abundance of the choicest and most palatable recipes, and  they are given in such a manner, that if the directions are followed,  the results are sure. You cannot make mistakes.    12mo, cloth, $1.50 net; by mail, $1.65      =Mrs. Rorer's Every Day Menu Book=    In the course of her teaching and editorial work, there have come to  Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for a book that will provide a daily bill  of fare, one that will be at once rational, its directions easy of  accomplishment, and give an excellent variety.

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, systematically arranged  by months and days; menus for special occasions, such as holidays,  weddings, luncheons, teas, etc.; illustrations of decorated tables for  various social events, with appropriate menus; menus arranged for the  seasons both as to food and decorations; a department of menus without  meats. A fine volume that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.    12mo, 300 pages, handsomely illustrated; bound in cloth $1.50 net; by  mail, $1.65      =Mrs. Rorer's Cakes, Icings and Fillings=    Every one is interested in the cake problem.

She has gathered these together, classifying them under  their different heads. There are Best 20 Soups; Best 20 Fish Recipes;  Best 20 Meats; Best 20 Salads; Best 20 Desserts; Best 20 Sauces,  Vegetables, Fruit Preserves, Luncheon Dishes, Ices, Summer Recipes, Left  Overs, Game and Poultry, Breads and Biscuits, etc.    12mo, cloth, 75 cents net; by mail, 80 cents      =Mrs. Rorer's New Salads=    For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. With a group of ODD  SALADS and some CEYLON SALADS.    A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and French dressing,  should be seen on the dinner table in every well-regulated household  three hundred and sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables  contain the salts necessary to the well being of our blood; the oil is  an easily-digested form of fatty matter; the lemon juice gives us  sufficient acid; therefore simple salads are exceedingly wholesome.    During the summer, the dinner salad may be composed of any well-cooked  green vegetable, served with a French dressing; string beans,  cauliflower, a mixture of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled  radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked spinach. In  the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and chicory.

When from any reason other things fail, the perplexed housewife  knows she can do something to tide over her difficulties by the use of  eggs. But how many know the great possibilities that lie in an egg--the  very many ways of cooking and preparing them for the table?

We quote from the author's introduction:    \"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase of inferior articles at  a cheap price, but of a small quantity of the best materials found in  the market; these materials to be wisely and economically used. Small  quantity and no waste, just enough and not a piece too much, is a good  rule to remember. In roasts and steaks, however, there will be, in spite  of careful buying, bits left over, that if economically used, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#9)"],[1,"qualities that often seemed quite human.    A certain vole, living in the river-bank near the place where the  villagers met to hunt, was not easily mistaken for one of his fellows.  Whereas the general colour of a water-vole's coat--except in the variety  known as the black vole--is greyish brown, which takes a reddish tinge  when the light glances on it between the leaves, his was uniformly of a  dark russet. In keeping with this shiny russet coat, his beady black  eyes seemed to glisten with unusual lustre; and so it happened that the  question, \"I wonder if Brighteye is from home?\" was often asked as we  sent our hounds to search among the willows on the further bank; and  later it became a custom for the Hunt, before the sport of the evening  was begun, to pass up-stream for a hundred yards or so in order that he  might be left in peace.    He was quite a baby water-vole when first I made his acquaintance, but  the colour of his coat did not change with the succeeding months, and,  evening after evening, when the noisy hounds were safe at home or  strolling about the village street, I would quietly make my way back to  his haunt, and, hidden behind a convenient tree, carefully watch him. In  this way I learned many secrets of his life, noticed many traits in  which he differed from his companions, and could form a fairly accurate  idea of the dangers that beset him, and of the joys and the sorrows that  fell to his lot during the three years when his presence was familiar as  I fished in the calm summer twilight, or lay motionless in the long  grass near the place where he was wont to sit, silent and alert, before  dropping into the backwater and beginning the work and the play of the  night.          II.    THE BURROW IN THE RIVER-BANK.      The first faint shadows of dusk were creeping over the river when  Brighteye, awakened by a movement on the part of his mother, stole from  his burrow into the tall grass at the edge of the gravel-bank by the  pool. His home was situated in a picturesque spot between the river and  a woodland path skirting the base of a cliff-like ascent clothed with  giant beeches and an under-garment of ferns and whinberry bushes. Alders  and willows grew along the gravel-bank, and through the moss-tangles  among the roots many a twisting, close-hidden run-way led upwards to  what might be called a main thoroughfare, in and out of the  grass-fringes and the ivy, above high-water mark. This road, extending  from the far-off tidal estuary to the river's source in the wild  mountains to the north, communicated with all the dwellings of the  riverside people, and had been kept clear for hundreds of years by  wandering voles and water-shrews, moorhens, water-rails, and coots, and,  in recent days, by those unwelcome invaders, the brown rats. Here and  there it merged into the wider trail of the otter. Sometimes, near a  hedge, it was joined by the track of rabbits, bank-voles, field-voles,  weasels, and stoats, and sometimes, where brooks and rills trickled over  the stones on their way to the river, by other main roads that had  followed the smaller water-courses from the crests of the hills.    Brighteye's home might be likened to a cottage nestling among trees at  the end of an embowered lane well removed from busy traffic; it  contained four or five chambers wherein the members of his family dwelt;  and to Brighteye the tall reeds and the bramble thickets were as large  as shrubs and trees are to human beings. And, like a sequestered  cottager, he knew but little about the great road stretching, up-stream  and down-stream, away from his haunts; he was content with his  particular domain--the pool, the shallows beyond, a hundred yards of  intersected lanes, and the wide main road above the pool and the  shallows.    For a time Brighteye sat at the edge of the stream, alert for any sign  of danger that might threaten his harmless existence. Then playfully he  dropped into the pool, dived, sought the water-entrance to his house,  climbed inside his sleeping chamber, and thence to the bank, where again  he sat intently listening as he sniffed the cool evening air. A  quick-eyed heron was standing motionless in a tranquil backwater thirty  yards up-stream; the scent of the bird was borne down by the water, and  the vole caught it as it passed beneath the bank. But he showed no trace  of terror; the heron was not near enough to give him any real cause for  alarm. The rabbits stole down through the woods, the undergrowth  crackled slightly as they passed, and one old buck \"drummed\" a danger  signal. Instantly the vole dived again, for he interpreted the sound to  mean that a weasel was on the prowl; and, as he vanished, the first  notes of a blackbird's rattling cry came to his ears.    Brighteye stayed awhile in his burrow before climbing once more to the  upper entrance. Then cautiously he advanced through the passage, and  gained his lookout station. Not the slightest taint of a weasel was  noticeable on the bank; so, regaining confidence, he sat on his  haunches, brushed his long, bristly whiskers with his fore-feet, and  licked his russet body clean with his warm, red tongue. Then he dropped  once more into the pool, and swam across to a reed-bed on the further  margin. There he found several of his neighbours feeding on roots of  riverside plants. He, too, was hungry, so he bit off a juicy flag at the  spot marking the junction of the tender stalk with the tough, fibrous  stem; then, sitting upright, he took it in his fore-paws, and with his  incisor teeth--shaped perfectly like an adze for such a  purpose--stripped it of its outer covering, beginning at the severed  edge, and laying bare the white pith, on which he greedily fed.    While thus engaged, he, as usual, watched and listened. The spot was  dangerous for him because of its distance from the stream, and because  the water immediately beyond was so shallow that he could not, by  diving, readily escape from determined pursuit.    His meal was often interrupted for a few moments by some trifling  incident that caused alarm. A moorhen splattered out from the  willow-roots, and Brighteye crouched motionless, till he recognised that  the noise made by the clumsy bird was almost as familiar to him as the  rustle of the reeds in a breeze. The blue heron rose heavily from the  backwater, and winged his slow flight high above the trees. Here,  indeed, seemed reason for fear; but the great bird was not in the humour  for killing voles, and soon passed out of view. Now a kingfisher, then a  dipper, sped like an arrow past the near corner of the pool; and the  whiz of swift wings--unheard by all except little creatures living in  frequent danger, and listening with beating hearts to sounds unperceived  by our drowsy senses dulled by long immunity from fear--caused momentary  terror to the water-vole. Each trifling sight and sound contributed to  that invaluable stock of experience from which he would gradually learn  to distinguish without hesitation between friends and foes, and be freed  from the pain of needless anxiety which, to Nature's weaklings, is at  times almost as bitter as death.    Brighteye was fated to meet with an unusual number of adventures, and  consequently to know much of the agony of fear. His russet coat was more  conspicuous than that of his soberly gowned companions, and he was on  several occasions marked for attack when they escaped detection. But he  became the wisest, shyest, most watchful vole along the wooded  river-reach, and in time his neighbours and offspring were so influenced  by his example and training that a strangely furtive kindred, the  wildest of the wild, living in secrecy--their presence revealed to  loitering anglers only by tell-tale footprints on the wet sand when the  torrent dwindled after a flood--seemed to have come to haunt the river  bank between the cottage gardens and the swinging bridge above the pool  where Brighteye dwelt.    Though Brighteye's distinctive appearance attracted the notice of  numerous enemies, his marked individuality was not wholly a misfortune,  since it aroused my kindly interest, and thus caused him to be spared by  the village hunting party.    As he sat in the first shadows of evening among the reeds and the  rushes, the kingfisher and the dipper, by which a few minutes before he  had been startled, flew back from the direction of the village gardens;  and he quickly decided, while watching their flight, that somehow it  must be connected with the dull, but now plainly audible, thud of  approaching footsteps on the meadow-path. The buck \"drummed\" again, then  the rustling \"pat, pat\" of the rabbits ceased in the wood, and one by  one the adult voles feeding in the reed-bed slipped silently into the  shallows and disappeared.    Brighteye was loath to relinquish the juicy rush that he held in his  fore-paws, but the signs of danger were insistent. After creeping  through the reeds to the water's edge, he proceeded a little way down  the bank till he came to a spot where the view of the meadow-path was  uninterrupted. His sight was not nearly so keen as his scent and hearing  were, but he discerned, in a blur of dim fields, and rippling water, and  evening light peering through the willow-stoles, a number of unfamiliar  moving objects. He heard quick, uneven footsteps, and, now and then, a  voice; and was aware of an unmistakable scent, such as he had already  often noticed in the shallows and amid the grass.    On several occasions, at dusk, Brighteye, like Lutra the otter, had seen  a trout splashing and twisting convulsively in terror and pain. Each  time the trout had been irresistibly drawn through the shallows towards  a peculiar, upright object on the opposite bank, and after this object  had passed into the distance the vole had found that the familiar scent  of which he was now conscious was mingled, at the edge of the  river-bank, with fresh"]]]
