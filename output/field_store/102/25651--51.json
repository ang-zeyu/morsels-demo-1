[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#9)"],[1,"I was lashed.    I waited, and fortune favored me in that I met Mr. John R. Bradley. We  planned the Arctic expedition on which I was now embarked. Mr. Bradley's  interest in the trip was that of a great sportsman, eager to seek big  game in the Arctic. My immediate purpose was to return again to the  frozen North. The least the journey would give me was an opportunity to  complete the study of the Eskimos which I had started in 1891.    Mr. Bradley and I had talked, of course, of the Pole; but it was not an  important incentive to the journey. Back in my brain, barely above the  subconscious realm, was the feeling that this, however, might offer  opportunity in the preparation for a final future determination. I,  therefore, without any conscious purpose, and with my last penny, paid  out of my purse for extra supplies for a personal expedition should I  leave the ship.[1]    Aboard the _Bradley_, going northward, my plans were not at all  definite. Even had I known before leaving New York that I should try for  the Pole, I should not have sought any geographical license from some  vague and unknown authority. Though much has since been made by critics  of our quiet departure, I always felt the quest of the Pole a personal  ambition[2], a crazy hunger I had to satisfy.    Fair weather followed us to Sydney, Cape Breton.    From this point we sailed over the Gulf of St. Lawrence, then entered  the Straits of Belle Isle at a lively speed. On a cold, cheerless day in  the middle of July we arrived at Battle Harbor, a little town at the  southeastern point of Labrador, where Mr. Bradley joined us. He had  preceded us north, by rail and coasting vessels, after watching a part  of the work of outfitting the schooner.    On the morning of July 16 we left the rockbound coast of North America  and steered straight for Greenland. In this region a dense and heavy fog  almost always lies upon the sea. Then nothing is visible but  slow-swaying gray masses, which veil all objects in a shroud of ghostly  dreariness. Through the fog can be heard the sound of fisher-boat horns,  often the very voices of the fishermen themselves, while their crafts  are absolutely hidden from view. On this trip, however, from time to  time, great fragments of fog slowly lifted, and we saw, emerging out of  the gray mistiness, islands, bleak and black and weathertorn, and  patches of ocean dotted with scores of Newfoundland boats, which invade  this region to fish for cod. We entered the Arctic current, and  breasting its stream, a fancy came that perhaps this current, flowing  down from out of the mysterious unknown, came from the very Pole itself.    Continuing, we entered Davis Straits, where we encountered headwinds  that piled up the water in great waves. It was a good test of the  sailing qualities of the _Bradley_, and well did the small craft  respond.    Long before the actual coast line of Greenland could be seen we had a  first glimpse of the beauties that these northern regions can show.  Like great sapphires, blue ice floated in a golden sea; towering masses  of crystal rose gloriously, dazzling the eye and gladdening the heart  with their superb beauty. The schooner sailed into this wonderful yellow  sea, which soon became a broad and gleaming surface of molten silver.  Although this striking beauty of the North, which it often is so chary  of displaying, possesses a splendor of color equal to the gloriousness  of tropical seas, it always impresses one with a steely hardness of  quality suggestive of the steely hardness of the heart of the North. And  it somehow seemed, curiously enough, as if all this wonderful glitter  was a shimmering reflection from the ice-covered mountains of the  Greenland interior, although the mountains themselves were still  invisible.    We swung from side to side, dodging icebergs. We steered cautiously  around low-floating masses, watching to see that the keel was not caught  by some treacherous jutting spur just beneath the water-line. Through  this fairyland of light and color we sailed slowly into a region rich in  animal life, a curious and striking sight. Seals floundered in the  sunbeams or slumbered on masses of ice, for even in this Northland there  is a strange commingling and contrast of heat and cold. Gulls and  petrels darted and fluttered about us in every direction, porpoises were  making swift and curving leaps, even a few whales added to the magic and  apparent unreality of it all.    At length the coast showed dimly upon the horizon, veiled in a glow of  purple and gold. The wind freshened, the sails filled, and the speed of  the schooner increased. We were gradually nearing Holsteinborg, and the  course was set a point more in towards shore. The land was thrown into  bold relief by the brilliancy of lights and shadows, and in the  remarkably clear air it seemed as if it could be reached in an hour. But  this was an atmospheric deception, of the kind familiar to those who  know the pure air of the Rocky Mountains, for, although the land seemed  near, it was at least forty miles away. The general color of the land  was a frosty blue, and there were deep valleys to be seen, gashes cut by  the slow movement of centuries of glaciers, with rocky headlands leaping  forward, bleak and cold. It appeared to be a land of sublime desolation.    The course was set still another point nearer the coast; the wind  continued fair and strong; and, with every possible stitch of canvas  spread, the schooner went rapidly onward.    We saw rocky islands, drenched by clouds of spray and battered by  drifting masses of ice. There the eider duck builds its nest and spends  the brief summer of the Arctic. We saw dismal cliffs, terra cotta and  buff in color, in the crevasses of which millions of birds made their  homes, and from which they rose, frightened, in dense clouds, giving  vent to a great volume of clamorous hoarseness.    Through our glasses we could see a surprising sight in such a  land--little patches of vegetation, seal brown or even emerald green.  Yet, so slight were these patches of green that one could not but wonder  what freak of imagination led the piratical Eric the Red, one thousand  years ago, to give to this coast a name so suggestive of luxuriant  forests and shrubs and general lushness of growth as \"Greenland.\" Never,  surely, was there a greater misnomer, unless one chooses to regard the  old-time Eric as a practical joker.    Between the tall headlands there were fiords cutting far into the  interior; arms of the sea, these, winding and twisting back for miles.  Along these quiet land-locked waters the Eskimos love to hunt and fish,  just as their forefathers have done for centuries. Shaggy looking  fellows are these Eskimos, clothed in the skins of animals, relieved by  dashes of color of Danish fabric, most of them still using spears, and  thus, to outward appearance, in the arts of life almost like those that  Eric saw.    Although this rugged coast, with its low-lying islands, its icebergs and  floating icefields, its bleak headlands, its picturesque scenes of  animal life, is a continuous delight, it presents the worst possible  dangers to navigation, not only from reefs and under-water ice, but  because there are no lighthouses to mark permanent danger spots and  because signs of impending storm are ever on the horizon. While  navigating the coast, our officers spent sleepless nights of anxiety;  but the shortening of the nights and lengthening of the days, the daily  night brightening resulting from the northerly movement, combined with  an occasional flash of the aurora, gradually relieved the tension of the  situation.    By the time the island of Disco rose splendidly out of the northern  blue, the Arctic Circle had been crossed, and a sort of celestial  light-house brightened the path of the schooner. Remaining on deck until  after midnight, we were rewarded by a sight of the sun magnified to many  times its normal size, glowing above the rim of the frosty sea. A light  wind blew gently from the coast, the sea ran in swells of gold, and the  sky was streaked with topaz and crimson.    Bathed in an indescribable glow, the towering sides of the greatest  icebergs showed a medley of ever-changing, iridescent colors. The  jutting pinnacles of others seemed like oriental minarets of alabaster  fretted with old gold. Here and there, as though flung by an invisible  hand from the zenith, straggled long cloud ribbons of flossy crimson and  silver. Gradually, imperially, the sun rose higher and flushed sky and  sea with deeper orange, more burning crimson, and the bergs into vivid  ruby, chalcedony and chrysophase walls. This suddenly-changing,  kaleidoscopic whirl of color was rendered more effective because, in its  midst, the cliffs of Disco rose frowningly, a great patch of blackness  in artistic contrast. A pearly vapor now began to creep over the  horizon, and gradually spread over the waters, imparting a gentle and  restful tone of blue. This gradually darkened into irregular shadows;  the brilliant color glories faded away. Finally we retired to sleep with  a feeling that sailing Poleward was merely a joyous pleasure journey  over wonderful and magic waters. This, the first glorious vision of the  midnight sun, glowed in my dreams--the augury of success in that for  which my heart yearned. The glow never faded, and the weird lure  unconsciously began to weave its spell.    Next morning, when we went on deck, the schooner was racing eastward  through heavy seas. The terraced cliffs of Disco, relieved by freshly  fallen snow, were but a few miles off. The cry of gulls and guillemots  echoed from rock to rock. Everything was divested of the glory of the  day before. The sun was slowly rising among mouse-colored clouds. The  bergs were of an ugly blue, and the sea ran in gloomy lines of ebony.  Although the sea was high, there was little wind, but we felt that a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36970"],[0,"The Confessions of a Poacher (#9)"],[1,"women are all employed in getting the hauls into town. In this women are  by far the most successful. Sometimes they are seen labouring under a  heavy load carried in a sack, with faggots and rotten sticks protruding  from the mouth; or again, with a large basket innocently covered with  crisp, green cresses which effectually hide the bright silvery fish  beneath. Our methods of fish poaching are many. As we work silently and  in the night, the chances of success are all in our favour. We walk much  by the stream side during the day, and take mental notes of men and  fish. We know the beats of the watchers, and have the water-side by  heart. Long use has accustomed us to work as well in the dark as in the  light, and this is essential. During summer, when the water is low, the  fish congregate in deep \"dubs.\" This they do for protection, and here,  if overhung by trees, there is always abundance of food. Whenever it was  our intention to net a dub, we carefully examined every inch of its  bottom beforehand. If it had been \"thorned,\" every thorn was carefully  removed--small thorn bushes with stones attached, and thrown in by the  watchers to entangle nets. Of course fish-poaching can never be tackled  single-handed. In \"long-netting\" the net is dragged by a man on each  side, a third wading after to lift it over the stakes, and to prevent  the fish from escaping. When the end of the pool is reached the salmon  and trout are simply drawn out upon the pebbles. This is repeated  through the night until half-a-dozen pools are netted--probably  depopulated of their fish. Netting of this description is a wholesale  method of capture, always supposing that we are allowed our own time. It  requires to be done slowly, however, as if alarmed we can do nothing but  abandon the net. This is necessarily large, and when thoroughly wet is  cumbersome and exceedingly heavy. The loss of one of our large nets  was a serious matter, not only in time but money. For narrow streams, a  narrow net is used, this being attached to two poles. It is better to  cut the poles (of ash) only when required, as they are awkward objects  to carry. The method of working the \"pod-net\" is the same in principle  as the last. The older fish poachers rarely go in for poisoning. This is  a cowardly method, and kills everything, both great and small, for miles  down stream. Chloride of lime is the agent mostly used, as it does not  injure the edible parts. The lime is thrown into the river where fish  are known to lie, and its deadly influence is soon seen. The fish,  weakened and poisoned, float belly uppermost. This at once renders them  conspicuous, and they are simply lifted out of the water in a  landing-net. Salmon and trout which come by their death in this way have  the usually pink parts of a dull white, with the eyes and gill-covers of  the same colour, and covered with a fine white film. This substance is  much used in mills on the banks of trout-streams, and probably more fish  are \"poached\" by this kind of pollution in a month than the most  inveterate moucher will kill in a year.    [Illustration]    It is only poachers of the old school that are careful to observe close  times, and they do their work mostly in summer. Many of the younger and  more desperate hands, however, do really serious business when the fish  are out of season. When salmon and trout are spawning their senses seem  to become dulled, and then they are not difficult to approach in the  water. They seek the highest reaches to spawn and stay for a  considerable time on the spawning beds. A salmon offers a fair mark, and  these are obtained by spearing. The pronged salmon spear is driven into  the fleshy shoulders of the fish, when it is hauled out on to the bank.  In this way I have often killed more fish in a single day than I could  possibly carry home--even when there was little or no chance of  detection. There is only one practicable way of carrying a big salmon  across country on a dark night, and that is by hanging it round one's  neck and steadying it in front. I have left tons of fish behind when  chased by the watchers, as of all things they are the most difficult  to carry. The best water bailiffs are those who are least seen, or who  watch from a distance. So as to save sudden surprise, and to give timely  warning of the approach of watchers, one of the poaching party should  always command the land from a tree top.    [Illustration]    The flesh of spawning fish is loose and watery, insipid and tasteless,  and rarely brings more than a few pence per pound. In an out-lying  hamlet known to me, poached salmon, during last close time, was so  common that the cottagers fed their poultry upon it through the winter.  Several fish were killed each over 20 lbs. in weight. Than netting,  another way of securing salmon and trout from the spawning redds is by  \"click\" hooks. These are simply large salmon hooks bound shaft to shaft  and attached to a long cord; a bit of lead balances them and adds  weight. These are used in the \"dubs\" when spearing by wading is  impracticable. When a salmon is seen the hooks are simply thrown beyond  it, then gently dragged until they come immediately beneath; when a  sharp click sends them into the soft under parts of the fish, which is  then dragged out. As the pike, which is one of nature's poachers, is  injurious to our interests as well as those of the angler, we never miss  an opportunity of treating him in the same summary manner. Of course,  poaching with click-hooks requires to be done during the day, or by the  aid of an artificial light. Light attracts salmon just as it attracts  birds, and tar brands are frequently used by poachers. A good, rough  bulls-eye lantern, to aid in spearing, can be made from a disused salmon  canister. A circular hole should be made in the side, and a bit of  material tied over to hide the light when not in use. Shooting is  sometimes resorted to, but for this class of poaching the habits and  beats of the water bailiffs require to be accurately known. The method  has the advantage of quickness, and a gun in skilful hands and at short  distance may be used without injuring the fleshy parts of the fish. That  deadly bait, salmon row, is now rarely used, the method of preparing it  being unknown to the younger generation. It can, however, be used with  deadly effect. Although both ourselves and our nets were occasionally  captured, the watchers generally found this a difficult matter. In  approaching our fishing grounds we did not mind going sinuously and  snake-like through the wet meadows, and as I have said, our nets were  rarely kept at home. These were secreted in stone heaps, and among  bushes in close proximity to where we intended to use them. Were they  kept at home the obtaining of a search warrant by the police or local  Angling Association would always render their custody a critical  business. When, upon any rare occasion, the nets were kept at home, it  was only for a short period, and when about to be used. Sometimes,  though rarely, the police have discovered them secreted in the chimney,  between bed and mattrass, or, in one case, wound about the portly person  of a poacher's wife. As I have already said, the women are not always  simply aiders and abettors, but in the actual poaching sometimes play an  important part. They have frequently been taken red-handed by the  watchers. Mention of the water-bailiffs reminds me that I must say a  word of them too. Their profession is a hard one--harder by far than the  poacher's. They work at night, and require to be most on the alert  during rough and wet weather; especially in winter when fish are  spawning. Sometimes they must remain still for hours in freezing  clothes; and even in summer not unfrequently lie all night in dank and  wet herbage. They see the night side of nature, and many of them are as  good naturalists as the poachers. If a lapwing gets up and screams in  the darkness the cleverer of them know how to interpret the sound, as  also a hare rushing wildly past. I must add, however, that it is in the  nature of things that at all points the fish poacher is cleverer and of  readier wit than the river watcher.    [Illustration]    Looking back it does not seem long since county constables first became  an institution in this part of the country. I remember an amusing  incident connected with one of them who was evidently a stranger to many  of the phases of woodcraft. We had been netting a deep dub just below a  stone bridge, and were about to land a splendid haul. Looking up, a  constable was watching our operations in an interested sort of way, and  for a moment we thought we were fairly caught. Just as we were about to  abandon the net and make off through the wood, the man spoke. In an  instant I saw how matters stood. He failed to grasp the situation--even  came down and helped us to draw the net on to the bank. In thanking us  for a silvery five-pound salmon we gave him he spoke with a southern  accent, and I suppose that poachers and poaching were subjects that had  never entered into his philosophy.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    Chapter 8.    GROUSE POACHING.      For pleasurable excitement, to say nothing of profit, the pick of all  poaching is for grouse. However fascinating partridge poaching may be;  however pleasurable picking off pheasants from bare boughs; or the  night-piercing screams of a netted hare--none of these can compare with  the wild work of the moors. I am abroad on the heather just before the  coming of the day. My way lies now along the rugged course of a fell  \"beck,\" now along the lower shoulder of the mountain. The grey  dissolves into dawn, the dawn into light, and the first blackcock crows  to his grey hen in the hollow. As my head appears above the burn side,  the ever-watchful curlews whistle and the plovers scream. A dotterel  goes plaintively piping over the stones,"]]]
