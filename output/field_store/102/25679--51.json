So this  Sheikh Ismail took this habit, and determined to shout and cry out  for Aly, whilst he took no heed of Mahomed. Many people began to  collect round him, so that he began soon to take towns and to grant  property to the persons who flocked to him, and were with him at a  conquest; and, in case they took nothing, he decided on making some  hoods of scarlet wool, of ample dimensions, and ordering them to be  worn by the persons who followed him;[106] thus he collected many  people, and with them he went on taking many towns, and making war  in many parts; and he did not choose to be called king, but the  leveller of property, who took from those who had much, and gave to  those who had little; neither did he choose to rest in any place.    But all that he conquered he gave away and distributed to those who  followed and obeyed him; whenever he found any very rich people  whose riches did not profit any one, he took them away and  distributed them amongst honourable people and the poor; and to the  owners of the property he left a share equal to that which he gave  to each one of the others; this he did many times, on which account  they called him the Equaller. This king sent ambassadors to all the  Moorish kings to persuade them to wear those coloured hoods, and if  they did not choose to accept them, he sent to challenge them, and  to say that he would come against them, to take their country, and  make them believe in Aly. He sent this embassy to the great Sultan  of Cairo and to the Grand Turk, who gave him a hostile answer and  made a league against him. As soon as Sheikh Ismail saw their  answers he determined to go against the Grand Turk, and he went  against him with large forces, horse and foot, and the Turk came out  to receive him, and they had a great battle,[107] in which the Grand  Turk was the conqueror, on account of the quantity of artillery  which he brought with him, which Sheikh Ismail did not bring, and he  only fought with his men with the strength of their arms. They  killed there many of his people, and he took to flight, and the Turk  followed him, killing many of his troops, until he left him within  Persia, when he returned thence to Turkey. This was the first time  that this Sheikh Ismail was routed, for which he said that he wished  to return to Turkey with greater power and provided with artillery.  This king ruled over a part of Babilonia, and Armenia, and Persia,  and a large part of Arabia, and of India, near to the kingdom of  Cambay. His design was to get into his hands the house of Mekkah.  This sheikh sent an embassy with many presents to the captain of the  king of Portugal, who was exercising his functions in India, and  asked him to agree to peace and friendship. And the Portuguese  captain-major received this embassy and presents, and in return sent  another embassy.[108]    At the extremity of this Sea of Persia there is, as has been said, a  fortress called Basera, inhabited by Moors, in subjection to Sheikh  Ismail, at which there comes out from the mainland to the sea a very  large and beautiful river of good fresh water, which is called  Frataha.[109] This is said to be one of the four rivers which flow  out of the terrestrial Paradise, which river is the Eufrates, and  these Moors say it has sixty thousand branches, and that one of the  principal ones comes out at the kingdom of Dahulcino, in which is  the first India, which we call the river Indus; and the river Ganges  is the other branch, which comes out in the second India to the sea;  and the Nile, which is another branch, which comes through the  country of Prester John, and waters Cairo.[110]      ISLAND AND CITY OF ORMUZ.    On coming out of the Sea and Strait of Persia, in its mouth there is  a small island, in which is the city of Ormuz, which is small and  very handsome, and with very pretty houses, lofty, of stone,  whitewash, and mortar, covered with terraces, and because the  country is very hot, they have fans made in such a manner that they  make the air come from their summits to the lower part of the houses  and rooms. It is a very well situated town, which has very good  streets and squares. Outside of this city, in the island itself,  there is a small mountain, which is entirely of rock salt and  sulphur; this salt is in great lumps, and very white and good: they  call it Indian salt, because nature produces it there; and the ships  which come there from all parts take this salt as ballast, because  in all other parts it is worth much money.    The inhabitants of this island and city are Persians and Arabs, and  they speak Arabic and another language which they call Persian. They  are very white, and good-looking people, of handsome bodies, both  men and women; and there are amongst them black and coloured people  also, who are from the country of Arabia. And the Persians, who are  very white, are fat and luxurious people, who live very well. They  are very voluptuous, and have musicians with various instruments.  There are among them very rich merchants, and many ships, because  they have a good port, and they trade in many kinds of goods, which  are imported there from many parts, and exported thence to other  parts of India. They bring there all sorts of spices, drugs,  precious stones, and other goods, such as pepper, ginger, cinnamon,  cloves, mace, nutmeg, long pepper, aloes-wood, sandal-wood,  brasil-wood, balsam, tamarinds, Indian saffron, beeswax, iron,  sugar, rice, cocoa-nuts, rubies, sapphires, giagonzas,[111]  amethysts, topazes, chrysolites, hyacinths, porcelain, benzoin; and  upon all these goods much money is made, and many stuffs from the  kingdom of Cambay, Chaul, Dabul, and Bengala, which are called  Sinabasos, Chautars, Mamonas, Dugasas, Soranatis, which are kinds of  stuffs of cotton very much valued amongst them for caps and shirts,  which are much made use of by the Arabs and Persians, and people of  Cairo, Aden, and Alexandria. They also bring to this city of Ormuz,  quicksilver, vermillion, rose-water, brocade and silk stuffs,  scarlet woollens, coarse camelots, and silk. And from China and  Catuy they bring to this city by land much fine silk in skeins, and  very rare musk and rhubarb;[112] and they bring from Babilonia very  fine torquoises, and some emeralds, and very fine lapis lazuli from  Acar. And from Baharem and Julfar they bring much seed pearl and  large pearls, and many horses from Arabia and Persia, of which they  carry away to India every year as many as five or six hundred, and  at times a thousand; and the ships which export these horses load  much salt, dates, and raisins, and sulphur, and of the other goods  which the Indians are pleased with.    These Moors of Ormuz are very well dressed, with very white, long,  and fine cotton shirts, and their fine drawers[113] of cotton, and  above that, very rich silk clothes and camelots, scarlet cloth, and  very rich gauzes, with which they wrap their waists[114], and they  wear in their girdles daggers and knives, ornamented with gold and  silver, and some heavy short swords, all adorned with gold and  silver, according to the rank of the wearers: and large round  shields, richly garnished with silk, and in their hands they carry  Turkish bows, painted with gold and very pretty colours, and their  cords are of silk. These bows are of stiff wood and of buffaloe's  horn; they carry very far, and these people are very good archers;  their arrows are slender and well worked. Others carry in their  hands iron maces, well wrought and elegant; others again,  battle-axes of various patterns and of very good temper, and inlaid  or enamelled.[115] They are very agreeable and polite people, and  very civil in their mutual relations. Their food is of very good  meats, very well cooked, wheaten bread, and very good rice, and many  other dishes very well prepared, and many kinds of conserves, and  preserved fruits, and others fresh: that is to say, apples,  pomegranates, peaches, apricots, figs, almonds, melons, radishes,  salads, and all the other things which there are in Spain; dates of  many kinds, and other eatables and fruits not used in our parts.  They drink wine of grapes in secret, because their law forbids it  them; and the water which they drink is flavoured with pistachio  nuts, and set to cool, for which purpose they employ and seek many  methods for cooling and preserving it cool. And all the noblemen and  honourable merchants always take, wherever they go, both in the  streets and public places, and on the road, a page with a bottle of  water, which is covered underneath with silver, or with a silver  cup, as much for state and show as for use and comfort. All these  people possess gardens and farms, to which they go to enjoy  themselves for some months of the year.[116]    This city of Ormuz is, as has been said, very rich and well supplied  with everything in the way of provisions, but everything is very  dear, because it is brought by sea from the towns of Arabia and  Persia, for in the island there is nothing that can be made use of  except salt; neither have they water to drink, for they bring it  each day in boats from the mainland or other neighbouring islands.  But for all that, the squares are full of all sorts of things, and  everything is sold by weight, and with great order and regulation.  And they give a very proper punishment to whoever falsifies the  weights or sells above the regulation price; and they also sell  cooked and roasted meat by weight, and so with all other cooked  victuals; and all these so well arranged and so clean that many  people do not have cooking done in their houses, but eat in the  squares.    The king is always in this city of Ormuz, in which he has some  beautiful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#9)"],[1,"and their  interest in our doings, and the Hired Retainer had been sent off next  morning with a note from Mrs. Ukridge inviting them to look over the  farm and stay to dinner.    \"Edwin?\" said Ukridge. \"Oh, beast of a cat.\"    \"Oh, Stanley!\" said Mrs. Ukridge plaintively. \"He's not. He's such a  dear, Mr. Garnet. A beautiful, pure-bred Persian. He has taken prizes.\"    \"He's always taking something. That's why he didn't come down with us.\"    \"A great, horrid, _beast_ of a dog bit him, Mr. Garnet. And poor Edwin  had to go to a cats' hospital.\"    \"And I hope,\" said Ukridge, \"the experience will do him good. Sneaked a  dog's dinner, Garnet, under his very nose, if you please. Naturally the  dog lodged a protest.\"    \"I'm so afraid that he will be frightened of Bob. He will be very  timid, and Bob's so boisterous. Isn't he, Mr. Garnet?\"    \"That's all right,\" said Ukridge. \"Bob won't hurt him, unless he tries  to steal his dinner. In that case we will have Edwin made into a rug.\"    \"Stanley doesn't like Edwin,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, sadly.    Edwin arrived early in the afternoon, and was shut into the kitchen. He  struck me as a handsome cat, but nervous.    The Derricks followed two hours later. Mr. Chase was not of the party.    \"Tom had to go to London,\" explained the professor, \"or he would have  been delighted to come. It was a disappointment to the boy, for he  wanted to see the farm.\"    \"He must come some other time,\" said Ukridge. \"We invite inspection.  Look here,\" he broke off suddenly--we were nearing the fowl-run now,  Mrs. Ukridge walking in front with Phyllis Derrick--\"were you ever at  Bristol?\"    \"Never, sir,\" said the professor.    \"Because I knew just such another fat little buffer there a few years  ago. Gay old bird, he was. He--\"    \"This is the fowl-run, professor,\" I broke in, with a moist, tingling  feeling across my forehead and up my spine. I saw the professor stiffen  as he walked, while his face deepened in colour. Ukridge's breezy way  of expressing himself is apt to electrify the stranger.    \"You will notice the able way--ha! ha!--in which the wire-netting is  arranged,\" I continued feverishly. \"Took some doing, that. By Jove,  yes. It was hot work. Nice lot of fowls, aren't they? Rather a mixed  lot, of course. Ha! ha! That's the dealer's fault though. We are  getting quite a number of eggs now. Hens wouldn't lay at first.  Couldn't make them.\"    I babbled on, till from the corner of my eye I saw the flush fade from  the professor's face and his back gradually relax its poker-like  attitude. The situation was saved for the moment but there was no  knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to  draw him aside as we went through the fowl-run, and expostulated.    \"For goodness sake, be careful,\" I whispered. \"You've no notion how  touchy he is.\"    \"But _I_ said nothing,\" he replied, amazed.    \"Hang it, you know, nobody likes to be called a fat little buffer to  his face.\"    \"What! My dear old man, nobody minds a little thing like that. We can't  be stilted and formal. It's ever so much more friendly to relax and be  chummy.\"    Here we rejoined the others, and I was left with a leaden foreboding of  gruesome things in store. I knew what manner of man Ukridge was when he  relaxed and became chummy. Friendships of years' standing had failed to  survive the test.    For the time being, however, all went well. In his role of lecturer he  offended no one, and Phyllis and her father behaved admirably. They  received his strangest theories without a twitch of the mouth.    \"Ah,\" the professor would say, \"now is that really so? Very interesting  indeed.\"    Only once, when Ukridge was describing some more than usually original  device for the furthering of the interests of his fowls, did a slight  spasm disturb Phyllis's look of attentive reverence.    \"And you have really had no previous experience in chicken-farming?\"  she said.    \"None,\" said Ukridge, beaming through his glasses. \"Not an atom. But I  can turn my hand to anything, you know. Things seem to come naturally  to me somehow.\"    \"I see,\" said Phyllis.    It was while matters were progressing with this beautiful smoothness  that I observed the square form of the Hired Retainer approaching us.  Somehow--I cannot say why--I had a feeling that he came with bad news.  Perhaps it was his air of quiet satisfaction which struck me as ominous.    \"Beg pardon, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"    Ukridge was in the middle of a very eloquent excursus on the feeding of  fowls, a subject on which he held views of his own as ingenious as they  were novel. The interruption annoyed him.    \"Well, Beale,\" he said, \"what is it?\"    \"That there cat, sir, what came to-day.\"    \"Oh, Beale,\" cried Mrs. Ukridge in agitation, \"_what_ has happened?\"    \"Having something to say to the missis--\"    \"What has happened? Oh, Beale, don't say that Edwin has been hurt?  Where is he? Oh, _poor_ Edwin!\"    \"Having something to say to the missis--\"    \"If Bob has bitten him I hope he had his nose _well_ scratched,\" said  Mrs. Ukridge vindictively.    \"Having something to say to the missis,\" resumed the Hired Retainer  tranquilly, \"I went into the kitchen ten minutes back. The cat was  sitting on the mat.\"    Beale's narrative style closely resembled that of a certain book I had  read in my infancy. I wish I could remember its title. It was a  well-written book.    \"Yes, Beale, yes?\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"Oh, do go on.\"    \"'Hullo, puss,' I says to him, 'and 'ow are _you_, sir?' 'Be careful,'  says the missis. ''E's that timid,' she says, 'you wouldn't believe,'  she says. ''E's only just settled down, as you may say,' she says. 'Ho,  don't you fret,' I says to her, ''im and me understands each other. 'Im  and me,' I says, 'is old friends. 'E's my dear old pal, Corporal  Banks.' She grinned at that, ma'am, Corporal Banks being a man we'd 'ad  many a 'earty laugh at in the old days. 'E was, in a manner of  speaking, a joke between us.\"    \"Oh, do--go--on, Beale. What has happened to Edwin?\"    The Hired Retainer proceeded in calm, even tones.    \"We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown,  trotted in. When the cat ketched sight of 'im sniffing about, there was  such a spitting and swearing as you never 'eard; and blowed,\" said Mr.  Beale amusedly, \"blowed if the old cat didn't give one jump, and move  in quick time up the chimney, where 'e now remains, paying no 'eed to  the missis' attempts to get him down again.\"    Sensation, as they say in the reports.    \"But he'll be cooked,\" cried Phyllis, open-eyed.    \"No, he won't. Nor will our dinner. Mrs. Beale always lets the kitchen  fire out during the afternoon. And how she's going to light it with  that----\"    There was a pause while one might count three. It was plain that the  speaker was struggling with himself.    \"--that cat,\" he concluded safely, \"up the chimney? It's a cold dinner  we'll get to-night, if that cat doesn't come down.\"    The professor's face fell. I had remarked on the occasion when I had  lunched with him his evident fondness for the pleasures of the table.  Cold impromptu dinners were plainly not to his taste.    We went to the kitchen in a body. Mrs. Beale was standing in front of  the empty grate, making seductive cat-noises up the chimney.    \"What's all this, Mrs. Beale?\" said Ukridge.    \"He won't come down, sir, not while he thinks Bob's about. And how I'm  to cook dinner for five with him up the chimney I don't see, sir.\"    \"Prod at him with a broom handle, Mrs. Beale,\" said Ukridge.    \"Oh, don't hurt poor Edwin,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"I 'ave tried that, sir, but I can't reach him, and I'm only bin and  drove 'im further up. What must be,\" added Mrs. Beale philosophically,  \"must be. He may come down of his own accord in the night. Bein'  'ungry.\"    \"Then what we must do,\" said Ukridge in a jovial manner, which to me at  least seemed out of place, \"is to have a regular, jolly picnic-dinner,  what? Whack up whatever we have in the larder, and eat that.\"    \"A regular, jolly picnic-dinner,\" repeated the professor gloomily. I  could read what was passing in his mind,--remorse for having come at  all, and a faint hope that it might not be too late to back out of it.    \"That will be splendid,\" said Phyllis.    \"Er, I think, my dear sir,\" said her father, \"it would be hardly fair  for us to give any further trouble to Mrs. Ukridge and yourself. If you  will allow me, therefore, I will----\"    Ukridge became gushingly hospitable. He refused to think of allowing  his guests to go empty away. He would be able to whack up something, he  said. There was quite a good deal of the ham left. He was sure. He  appealed to me to endorse his view that there was a tin of sardines and  part of a cold fowl and plenty of bread and cheese.    \"And after all,\" he said, speaking for the whole company in the  generous, comprehensive way enthusiasts have, \"what more do we want in  weather like this? A nice, light, cold, dinner is ever so much better  for us than a lot of hot things.\"    We strolled out again into the garden, but somehow things seemed to  drag. Conversation was fitful, except on the part of Ukridge, who  continued to talk easily on all subjects, unconscious of the fact that  the party was depressed and at least one of his guests rapidly becoming  irritable. I watched the professor furtively as Ukridge talked on, and  that ominous phrase of Mr. Chase's concerning four-point-seven guns  kept coming into my mind. If Ukridge were to tread on any of his pet  corns, as he might at any minute, there would be an explosion. The  snatching of the dinner from his very mouth, as it were, and the  substitution of a bread-and-cheese and sardines menu had brought him to  the frame of mind when men turn and rend their nearest and dearest.    The sight of the table, when at length we filed into the dining room,  sent a chill through me. It was a meal for"]]]
