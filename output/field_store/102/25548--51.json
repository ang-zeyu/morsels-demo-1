The one you called White-when-he's-wanted.\"    \"The deuce you did! Are you sure? Who had him?\"    \"Sure! I'd swear to him anywhere. A little drover fellow had him. A  little fellow, with a big scar across his forehead. Came from Monaro way  somewhere. He said he bought the horse from you for fifteen notes.\"    The King's warrant doesn't run much out west of Boulia, and it is not  likely that any of us will ever see the drover again, or will ever again  cross the back of \"White-when-he's-wanted\".          THE DOWNFALL OF MULLIGAN'S      The sporting men of Mulligan's were an exceedingly knowing lot; in fact,  they had obtained the name amongst their neighbours of being a little  bit too knowing. They had \"taken down\" the adjoining town in a variety  of ways. They were always winning maiden plates with horses which were  shrewdly suspected to be old and well-tried performers in disguise.    When the sports of Paddy's Flat unearthed a phenomenal runner in the  shape of a blackfellow called Frying-pan Joe, the Mulligan contingent  immediately took the trouble to discover a blackfellow of their own,  and they made a match and won all the Paddy's Flat money with ridiculous  ease; then their blackfellow turned out to be a well-known Sydney  performer. They had a man who could fight, a man who could be backed to  jump five-feet-ten, a man who could kill eight pigeons out of nine at  thirty yards, a man who could make a break of fifty or so at billiards  if he tried; they could all drink, and they all had that indefinite look  of infinite wisdom and conscious superiority which belongs only to those  who know something about horseflesh.    They knew a great many things never learnt at Sunday-school. They were  experts at cards and dice. They would go to immense trouble to work off  any small swindle in the sporting line. In short the general consensus  of opinion was that they were a very \"fly\" crowd at Mulligan's, and if  you went there you wanted to \"keep your eyes skinned\" or they'd \"have\"  you over a threepenny-bit.    There were races at Sydney one Christmas, and a select band of the  Mulligan sportsmen were going down to them. They were in high  feather, having just won a lot of money from a young Englishman at  pigeon-shooting, by the simple method of slipping blank cartridges into  his gun when he wasn't looking, and then backing the bird.    They intended to make a fortune out of the Sydney people, and admirers  who came to see them off only asked them as a favour to leave money  enough in Sydney to make it worth while for another detachment to go  down later on. Just as the train was departing a priest came running on  to the platform, and was bundled into the carriage where our Mulligan  friends were; the door was slammed to, and away they went. His Reverence  was hot and perspiring, and for a few minutes mopped himself with a  handkerchief, while the silence was unbroken except by the rattle of the  train.    After a while one of the Mulligan fraternity got out a pack of cards and  proposed a game to while away the time. There was a young squatter in  the carriage who looked as if he might be induced to lose a few pounds,  and the sportsmen thought they would be neglecting their opportunities  if they did not try to \"get a bit to go on with\" from him. He agreed to  play, and, just as a matter of courtesy, they asked the priest whether  he would take a hand.    \"What game d'ye play?\" he asked, in a melodious brogue.    They explained that any game was equally acceptable to them, but they  thought it right to add that they generally played for money.    \"Sure an' it don't matter for wanst in a way,\" said he--\"Oi'll take  a hand bedad--Oi'm only going about fifty miles, so Oi can't lose a  fortune.\"    They lifted a light portmanteau on to their knees to make a table, and  five of them--three of the Mulligan crowd and the two strangers--started  to have a little game of poker. Things looked rosy for the Mulligan  boys, who chuckled as they thought how soon they were making a  beginning, and what a magnificent yarn they would have to tell about how  they rooked a priest on the way down.    Nothing sensational resulted from the first few deals, and the priest  began to ask questions.    \"Be ye going to the races?\"    They said they were.    \"Ah! and Oi suppose ye'll be betting wid thim bookmakers--betting on the  horses, will yez? They do be terrible knowing men, thim bookmakers, they  tell me. I wouldn't bet much if Oi was ye,\" he said, with an affable  smile. \"If ye go bettin' ye will be took in wid thim bookmakers.\"    The boys listened with a bored air and reckoned that by the time they  parted the priest would have learnt that they were well able to look  after themselves. They went steadily on with the game, and the priest  and the young squatter won slightly; this was part of the plan to lead  them on to plunge. They neared the station where the priest was to get  out. He had won rather more than they liked, so the signal was passed  round to \"put the cross on\". Poker is a game at which a man need not  risk much unless he feels inclined, and on this deal the priest stood  out. Consequently, when they drew up at his station he was still a few  pounds in.    \"Bedad,\" he said, \"Oi don't loike goin' away wid yer money. Oi'll go on  to the next station so as ye can have revinge.\" Then he sat down again,  and play went on in earnest.    The man of religion seemed to have the Devil's own luck. When he was  dealt a good hand he invariably backed it well, and if he had a bad one  he would not risk anything. The sports grew painfully anxious as they  saw him getting further and further ahead of them, prattling away all  the time like a big schoolboy. The squatter was the biggest loser so  far, but the priest was the only winner. All the others were out of  pocket. His reverence played with great dash, and seemed to know a lot  about the game, so that on arrival at the second station he was a good  round sum in pocket.    He rose to leave them with many expressions of regret, and laughingly  promised full revenge next time. Just as he was opening the carriage  door, one of the Mulligan fraternity said in a stage-whisper: \"He's a  blanky sink-pocket. If he can come this far, let him come on to Sydney  and play for double the stakes.\" Like a shot the priest turned on him.    \"Bedad, an' if _that's_ yer talk, Oi'll play ye fer double stakes from  here to the other side of glory. Do yez think men are mice because they  eat cheese? It isn't one of the Ryans would be fearing to give any man  his revinge!\"    He snorted defiance at them, grabbed his cards and waded in. The others  felt that a crisis was at hand and settled down to play in a dead  silence. But the priest kept on winning steadily, and the \"old man\" of  the Mulligan push saw that something decisive must be done, and decided  on a big plunge to get all the money back on one hand. By a dexterous  manipulation of the cards he dealt himself four kings, almost the best  hand at poker. Then he began with assumed hesitation to bet on his hand,  raising the stake little by little.    \"Sure ye're trying to bluff, so ye are!\" said the priest, and  immediately raised it.    The others had dropped out of the game and watched with painful interest  the stake grow and grow. The Mulligan fraternity felt a cheerful  certainty that the \"old man\" had made things safe, and regarded  themselves as mercifully delivered from an unpleasant situation.  The priest went on doggedly raising the stake in response to his  antagonist's challenges until it had attained huge dimensions.    \"Sure that's high enough,\" said he, putting into the pool sufficient to  entitle him to see his opponent's hand.    The \"old man\" with great gravity laid down his four kings, whereat the  Mulligan boys let a big sigh of relief escape them.    Then the priest laid down four aces and scooped the pool.    The sportsmen of Mulligan's never quite knew how they got out to  Randwick. They borrowed a bit of money in Sydney, and found themselves  in the saddling-paddock in a half-dazed condition, trying to realize  what had happened to them. During the afternoon they were up at the end  of the lawn near the Leger stand and could hear the babel of tongues,  small bookmakers, thimble riggers, confidence men, and so on, plying  their trades outside. In the tumult of voices they heard one that  sounded familiar. Soon suspicion grew into certainty, and they knew that  it was the voice of \"Father\" Ryan. They walked to the fence and looked  over. This is what he was saying:--    \"Pop it down, gents! Pop it down! If you don't put down a brick you  can't pick up a castle! I'll bet no one here can pick the knave of  hearts out of these three cards. I'll bet half-a-sovereign no one here  can find the knave!\"    Then the crowd parted a little, and through the opening they could see  him distinctly, doing a great business and showing wonderful dexterity  with the pasteboard.    There is still enough money in Sydney to make it worth while for another  detachment to come down from Mulligan's; but the next lot will hesitate  about playing poker with priests in the train.          THE AMATEUR GARDENER      The first step in amateur gardening is to sit down and consider what  good you are going to get by it. If you are only a tenant by the month,  as most people are, it is obviously not of much use for you to plant a  fruit orchard or an avenue of oak trees. What you want is something that  will grow quickly, and will stand transplanting, for when you move it  would be a sin to leave behind you the plants on which you have spent so  much labour and so much patent manure.    We knew a man once who was a bookmaker by trade--and a Leger bookmaker  at that--but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#9)"],[1," ground hair on the one side,  is blocked out only on the other: it having been supposed throughout the  work that the effigy was only to be seen from below, and from one side.    Sec. XLIII. It was indeed to be so seen by nearly every one; and I do  not blame--I should, on the contrary, have praised--the sculptor for  regulating his treatment of it by its position; if that treatment had  not involved, first, dishonesty, in giving only half a face, a  monstrous mask, when we demanded true portraiture of the dead; and,  secondly, such utter coldness of feeling, as could only consist with an  extreme of intellectual and moral degradation: Who, with a heart in his  breast, could have stayed his hand as he drew the dim lines of the old  man's countenance--unmajestic once, indeed, but at least sanctified by  the solemnities of death--could have stayed his hand, as he reached the  bend of the grey forehead, and measured out the last veins of it at so  much the zecchin?    I do not think the reader, if he has feeling, will expect that much  talent should be shown in the rest of his work, by the sculptor of this  base and senseless lie. The whole monument is one wearisome aggregation  of that species of ornamental flourish, which, when it is done with a  pen, is called penmanship, and when done with a chisel, should be called  chiselmanship; the subject of it being chiefly fat-limbed boys sprawling  on dolphins, dolphins incapable of swimming, and dragged along the sea  by expanded pocket-handkerchiefs.    But now, reader, comes the very gist and point of the whole matter. This  lying monument to a dishonored doge, this culminating pride of the  Renaissance art of Venice, is at least veracious, if in nothing else, in  its testimony to the character of its sculptor. _He was banished from  Venice for forgery_ in 1487.[25]    Sec. XLIV. I have more to say about this convict's work hereafter; but I  pass at present, to the second, slighter, but yet more interesting piece  of evidence, which I promised.    The ducal palace has two principal facades; one towards the sea, the  other towards the Piazzetta. The seaward side, and, as far as the  seventh main arch inclusive, the Piazzetta side, is work of the early  part of the fourteenth century, some of it perhaps even earlier; while  the rest of the Piazzetta side is of the fifteenth. The difference in  age has been gravely disputed by the Venetian antiquaries, who have  examined many documents on the subject, and quoted some which they never  examined. I have myself collated most of the written documents, and one  document more, to which the Venetian antiquaries never thought of  referring,--the masonry of the palace itself.    Sec. XLV. That masonry changes at the centre of the eighth arch from  the sea angle on the Piazzetta side. It has been of comparatively small  stones up to that point; the fifteenth century work instantly begins  with larger stones, \"brought from Istria, a hundred miles away.\"[26] The  ninth shaft from the sea in the lower arcade, and the seventeenth, which  is above it, in the upper arcade, commence the series of fifteenth  century shafts. These two are somewhat thicker than the others, and  carry the party-wall of the Sala del Scrutinio. Now observe, reader. The  face of the palace, from this point to the Porta della Carta, was built  at the instance of that noble Doge Mocenigo beside whose tomb you have  been standing; at his instance, and in the beginning of the reign of his  successor, Foscari; that is to say, circa 1424. This is not disputed; it  is only disputed that the sea facade is earlier; of which, however, the  proofs are as simple as they are incontrovertible: for not only the  masonry, but the sculpture, changes at the ninth lower shaft, and that  in the capitals of the shafts both of the upper and lower arcade: the  costumes of the figures introduced in the sea facade being purely  Giottesque, correspondent with Giotto's work in the Arena Chapel at  Padua, while the costume on the other capitals is Renaissance-Classic:  and the lions' heads between the arches change at the same point. And  there are a multitude of other evidences in the statues of the angels,  with which I shall not at present trouble the reader.    Sec. XLVI. Now, the architect who built under Foscari, in 1424 (remember  my date for the decline of Venice, 1418), was obliged to follow the  principal forms of the older palace. But he had not the wit to invent  new capitals in the same style; he therefore clumsily copied the old  ones. The palace has seventeen main arches on the sea facade, eighteen  on the Piazzetta side, which in all are of course carried by thirty-six  pillars; and these pillars I shall always number from right to left,  from the angle of the palace at the Ponte della Paglia to that next the  Porta della Carta. I number them in this succession, because I thus have  the earliest shafts first numbered. So counted, the 1st, the 18th, and  the 36th, are the great supports of the angles of the palace; and the  first of the fifteenth century series, being, as above stated, the 9th  from the sea on the Piazzetta side, is the 26th of the entire series,  and will always in future be so numbered, so that all numbers above  twenty-six indicate fifteenth century work, and all below it, fourteenth  century, with some exceptional cases of restoration.    Then the copied capitals are: the 28th, copied from the 7th; the 29th,  from the 9th; the 30th, from the 10th; the 31st, from the 8th; the 33rd,  from the 12th; and the 34th, from the 11th; the others being dull  inventions of the 15th century, except the 36th, which is very nobly  designed.    Sec. XLVII. The capitals thus selected from the earlier portion of  the palace for imitation, together with the rest, will be accurately  described hereafter; the point I have here to notice is in the copy of  the ninth capital, which was decorated (being, like the rest, octagonal)  with figures of the eight Virtues:--Faith, Hope, Charity, Justice,  Temperance, Prudence, Humility (the Venetian antiquaries call it  Humanity!), and Fortitude. The Virtues of the fourteenth century are  somewhat hard-featured; with vivid and living expression, and plain  every-day clothes of the time. Charity has her lap full of apples  (perhaps loaves), and is giving one to a little child, who stretches his  arm for it across a gap in the leafage of the capital. Fortitude tears  open a lion's jaws; Faith lays her hand on her breast, as she beholds  the Cross; and Hope is praying, while above her a hand is seen emerging  from sunbeams--the hand of God (according to that of Revelations, \"The  Lord God giveth them light\"); and the inscription above is, \"Spes optima  in Deo.\"    Sec. XLVIII. This design, then, is, rudely and with imperfect chiselling,  imitated by the fifteenth century workmen: the Virtues have lost their  hard features and living expression; they have now all got Roman noses,  and have had their hair curled. Their actions and emblems are, however,  preserved until we come to Hope: she is still praying, but she is  praying to the sun only: _The hand of God is gone._    Is not this a curious and striking type of the spirit which had then  become dominant in the world, forgetting to see God's hand in the light  He gave; so that in the issue, when that light opened into the  Reformation, on the one side, and into full knowledge of ancient  literature on the other, the one was arrested and the other perverted?    Sec. XLIX. Such is the nature of the accidental evidence on which I shall  depend for the proof of the inferiority of character in the Renaissance  workmen. But the proof of the inferiority of the work itself is not so  easy, for in this I have to appeal to judgments which the Renaissance  work has itself distorted. I felt this difficulty very forcibly as I  read a slight review of my former work, \"The Seven Lamps,\" in \"The  Architect:\" the writer noticed my constant praise of St. Mark's: \"Mr.  Ruskin thinks it a very beautiful building! We,\" said the Architect,  \"think it a very ugly building.\" I was not surprised at the difference  of opinion, but at the thing being considered so completely a subject of  opinion. My opponents in matters of painting always assume that there  _is_ such a thing as a law of right, and that I do not understand it:  but my architectural adversaries appeal to no law, they simply set their  opinion against mine; and indeed there is no law at present to which  either they or I can appeal. No man can speak with rational decision of  the merits or demerits of buildings: he may with obstinacy; he may with  resolved adherence to previous prejudices; but never as if the matter  could be otherwise decided than by a majority of votes, or pertinacity  of partizanship. I had always, however, a clear conviction that there  _was_ a law in this matter: that good architecture might be indisputably  discerned and divided from the bad; that the opposition in their very  nature and essence was clearly visible; and that we were all of us just  as unwise in disputing about the matter without reference to principle,  as we should be for debating about the genuineness of a coin, without  ringing it. I felt also assured that this law must be universal if it  were conclusive; that it must enable us to reject all foolish and base  work, and to accept all noble and wise work, without reference to style  or national feeling; that it must sanction the design of all truly great  nations and times, Gothic or Greek or Arab; that it must cast off and  reprobate the design of all foolish nations and times, Chinese or  Mexican, or modern European: and that it must be easily applicable to  all possible architectural inventions of human mind. I set myself,  therefore, to establish such a law, in full belief that men are  intended, without excessive difficulty, and by use of their general  common sense, to know good things from bad; "]]]
