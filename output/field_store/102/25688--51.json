Just as the importance of the cattle to primitive and pastoral Aryan  life explains the propensity of the Aryan mind to conceive of the  mobile phenomena of the heavens, at first considered living beings, as  bulls and cows, so the consecration of these animals, associated and  identified with the celestial phenomena and the gods, naturally gave  rise to the superstitious worship of the bull and the cow, common to  all the Aryan nations, but particularly, through the intervention of  the brahmanic priests, to the Hindoos.    It is a remarkable fact that the words _vrishas_, _vrishabhas_, and  _rishabhas_, which mean the bull as the one who pours out, the  _foecundator_, is often used in Sanscrit to denote the best, the  first, the prince; and hence the bull, that is to say, the best  _foecundator_, is in India the most sacred symbol of royalty. For this  reason the phallic and destroying god, the royal _Civas_, who inhabits  _Gokarnas_ (a word which properly means cow's ear), has both for his  steed and his emblem a brahmanic bull, _i.e._, a bull with a hunch on  its back; the _nandin_, or joyful attribute, being given to Civas  himself, inasmuch as, being the _Deus phallicus_, he is the god of  joyfulness and beatitude.[132]    Still more honour is paid to the cow (like the Vedic dawn _anavadya_,  innocent or inculpable[133]), which therefore it was a crime to  kill.[134] An interesting chapter of the _Aitareya-brahmanam_,[135] on  the sacrifice of animals, shows us how, next to man, the horse was the  supreme sacrifice offered to the gods; how the cow afterwards took the  place of the horse; the sheep, of the cow; the goat, of the sheep;  and, at last, vegetable products were substituted for animals;--a  substitution or cheating of the gods in the sacrifice, which, perhaps,  serves to explain even more the fraud of which, in popular stories,  the simpleton is always the victim; the simpleton here being the god  himself, and the cheater man, who changes, under a sacred pretext, the  noblest and most valued animals for common and less valuable ones, and  finally for vegetables apparently of no value whatever. In the Hindoo  codes of law we have the same fraudulent substitution of animals under  a legal pretext. \"The killer of a cow,\" says the code attributed to  _Yagnavalkyas_,[136] \"must stay a month in penitence, drinking the  _pancagavyam_ (_i.e._, the five good productions of the cow, which,  according to Manus,[137] are milk, curds, butter, urine, and dung),  sleeping in a stable and following the cows; and he must purify  himself by the gift of another cow.\" Thus, according to  _Yagnavalkya_,[138] the killer of a parrot is purified by giving a  two-year-old calf; the killer of a crane by giving a calf three years  old; the killer of an ass, a goat, or a sheep, by the gift of a bull;  the killer of an elephant by the gift of five black bulls  (_nilavrishap_). And one need not be astonished to find these  contracts (which remind one of that between Jacob and Laban) in the  Hindoo codes of law, when, in the Vedic hymns themselves, a poet  offers to sell to whoever will buy it, an Indras of his, that is to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#9)"],[1,"ux, that frightful little village, with  its chemical works, which I used to write about so much in April and May  last. Once again yesterday it became a shambles. The British had machine  guns well placed with a wide field of fire, and as the Germans came down  the slopes they were swept with streams of bullets, which cut swaths in  their formations, but once again, as on March 21, the enemy was reckless  of life, theirs as well as the British, and always his tide of men  flowed forward, passing over dead and wounded, and creeping forward like  flowing water. The British field guns raked them while the heavies  pulled further back to avoid being blown up or captured.      FIGHT FOR ORANGE HILL    On and about Orange Hill and Telegraph Hill British battalions who know  this ground of old fought tenaciously under murderous machine-gun fire,  the enemy's screen of infantry covering machine-gun batteries which were  rushed forward very quickly and took up positions in shell holes and  behind bits of broken wall and any kind of cover, in ditches and sunken  roads.    A footing gained by the enemy on part of Orange Hill and Infantry Hill  rendered it necessary to fall back yesterday toward the old German  support lines before that battle in April, 1917. The British fought like  tigers, and would not retire until the pressure on them made it  impossible to resist the continual thrust of new attacks by fresh  troops. There were heroic actions by small groups of men struggling to  hold up the front line, and some of them stayed so long after the enemy  had broken beyond them that they were cut off.    Frightful fighting was happening not far from Neuville, Vitasse, and  Mercatel and in this neighborhood the British held out with wonderful  determination until exhausted by battle and until only a poor remnant of  men had strength to stand against these massed attacks.    By the end of the day the enemy's assaults weakened, and then died out  because his losses were enormous and the spirit of his attack was broken  by such stubborn resistance.      ENEMY FAILS AT ARRAS    _Sunday, March 31._--We now have knowledge that the attack on Arras was  prepared on a scale of enormous strength by divisions arranged in depth,  preceded by a bombardment as great as that which fell upon any part of  the British line on the morning of March 21, and that the enemy had  determined to capture not only Arras itself but Vimy Ridge.    It was the heroic resistance of the British troops that defeated this  furious onslaught and destroyed by enormous losses to the German troops  this dark scheme of their high command. Seven German divisions were in  position north of the Scarpe and twelve south, in an arc around the  defenses of Arras.    The brunt of this attack, preceded by colossal gunfire, fell upon London  troops, and against these the German tides dashed and broke. By  artillery fire, machine-gun fire, and rifle fire, the enemy's advancing  waves of men were swept to pieces, and though they came on again and  again this massacre continued until at last it must have sickened even  the high German officers directing the operations from behind. The  attacks died out and the night was quiet around Arras while the enemy  collected his wounded. It was an utter defeat which will at least check  German efforts around Arras.    On this Easter Sunday, under bright sunshine which is breaking through  the storm clouds, the fields of France are strewn with death. A year ago  it was the same around the old City of Artois, for it was on Easter  Sunday, April 2, that we began the battle of Arras and fought over that  ground which is again our battlefield, and it was a great anthem of  gunfire which rose up to the sky on Easter morn.    Apart from all regrets at having had to fall back at all and at having  suffered losses for which there is mourning in our hearts, because so  many splendid men have fallen on the field of honor--that terrible field  of honor which will be watered with tears for all time--we may at least  rejoice that by the skill of our fighting officers and the steady  courage of our men our line was brought back unbroken.      Heroic Cavalry Charge    _Monday, April 1._--The battle of which I have been trying to give a  daily narrative has been on so vast a scale, filled with so many  episodes of terrific adventure and with so many hundreds of thousands of  men moving along its lines of fire that I find it impossible to give a  picture of the emotion and spirit of it. We out here, who knew this  thing was coming upon us, creeping nearer every day with its monstrous  menace, held our breath and waited. When at last the thing broke it was  more frightful in its loosing of overwhelming powers than even we had  guessed. Since then all our armies have lived with an intense  understanding of the greatness of these days, of their meaning to the  destiny of the world, and every private soldier, or transport driver, or  linesman, or laborer, has been exalted by an emotion stronger than the  effect of drugs.    In the wood of Moreuil this morning British cavalry performed a feat as  fine as the Balaklava charge, and this also should be made into a ballad  and learned by heart.    Twelve hundred men who had been riding through the night went forward in  three waves and charged that dark wood next morning at a hard gallop.  The first wave rode to the edge of the wood, and the second to the  centre, and the third wave went right through to the other side, riding  through the enemy and over his machine guns and in the face of a hail of  bullets from hidden machines. They cleared the wood of Moreuil and  brought back prisoners and thirteen machine guns, but there were many  empty saddles, and many men and horses fell.    That was the finest exploit of the British 'Cavalry, but elsewhere it  did splendid work, and everywhere the men were gallant and cool, as when  some of the dragoons came under a heavy shrapnel fire near Gentille, and  many men had to shoot their wounded horses to put them out of their  agony.      Dashing Canadians    Away from Arras and down on the south of the line a certain body of  Canadians have been having some of the most astounding adventures in all  this battle, and fighting with valor and heroic audacity. They are  officers and men of a machine gun detachment organized in the early days  of the war by a French Canadian officer.    For ten days these Canadians have fought running fights with the German  artillery, have engaged German cavalry and smashed them, have checked  enemy columns crossing bridges and pouring onward, have scattered large  bodies of men surrounding British troops, and in ten days of crowded  life have destroyed many German storm troops and helped to hold up the  tide of their advance. Their own losses have not been light, for these  Canadians have been filled with a grim passion of determination, and  when the supreme test came they fought and died.    Sometimes they fought in long gray open cars, and sometimes they fought  dismounted, with machine guns on the ground; but always they fought  through the ten days and nights, with less than twenty hours' sleep all  that time. These cars near Maricourt gathered together 150 men who had  been cut off and held the enemy at bay, covering the withdrawal of some  of the British heavy guns and tanks. At that time they fought  dismounted, with Vickers guns, in front of the barbed wire. The  Canadians had many casualties, and a Captain's arm was torn away by an  explosive bullet, and at last only a Sergeant and two men of the battery  were left unwounded. One of them mounted a motor cycle and brought back  cars and took back the wounded. Two cars found the enemy massing up a  road, and their machine guns enfiladed the field-gray men and killed  them in large numbers.    Near La Motte they fought heavy bodies of German cavalry, killed a  number, and put the rest to flight. They have not been seen since. At  Cerisy a battalion of Germans, 600 strong, was encountered at a  crossroads by one car, which brought them to a standstill and dispersed  them with heavy losses. Everywhere they have been these Canadian armored  cars have helped to steady the line and give confidence to the infantry.      British Airmen at Work    _Thursday, April 4._--It has been raining hard these two nights past and  this morning. For the German gunners trying to drag up field artillery  or long-range guns there is now sticky bog and slime to come through. It  is hard work for the German field companies, pressed furiously, to lay  narrow-gauge lines over these deserts. All that spells delay in their  plans and loss of life.    There is terror for the enemy over these fields in daylight and  darkness, for the British flying men have gone out in squadrons to  scatter death and destruction among them. This work has reached  fantastic heights of horror for the German troops under the menace of  it. There have been times when, I believe, the British have had as many  as 300 airplanes up at one time. One squadron alone on one night dropped  six tons of bombs over enemy concentrations, and each man went out six  times. Another squadron went out four times in one night, and was  bombing for eleven hours.    When the enemy was advancing in masses the British flying men flew as  low as 100 feet, dropping bombs among them and firing into them with  machine guns. They attacked German patrols of cavalry and scattered them  and machine-gunned trenches full of men, batteries in action and  transport crowding down narrow roads. They fought German scouts and  crushed them, and there are several cases in which they fought German  airplanes at night, so that it was like a fight between vampire bats up  there where the clouds were touched by moonlight.      North of the Somme    _Friday, April 5._--Heavy attacks by the enemy are in progress north of  the Somme, from Albert to Aveluy Wood. Further north"]]]
