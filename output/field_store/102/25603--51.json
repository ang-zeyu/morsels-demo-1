Had we no knowledge whatever of the  caterpillar's twelve little eyes, we should probably have thought that  it sought out its food by some sense other than that of vision.    Another important and interesting feature of the head is the  silk-spinning apparatus, situated under cover of the lower lip. This  consists of two tubular glands, corresponding to our own salivary  glands, the special purpose of which is to secrete a viscid fluid that  solidifies on exposure to air. The opening by which the fluid escapes is  so situated that the caterpillar can easily apply it to the surface of  any object over which it is walking, and then, by drawing or turning  away its head, cause a silken fibre to be produced.    Some caterpillars make use of this spinning apparatus only on a few  special occasions, but others, more especially some of the smaller  species, seem to have it always in use, so that if at any time you  suddenly start them into the air by giving a smart tap to the plant or  twig on which they rest, they invariably fall slowly on the end of a  growing web, the spinning of which they stop as soon as they consider  they have fallen far enough. Sometimes, as you are walking through a  wood, you will see hundreds, nay, thousands of little caterpillars thus  suspended, swinging gently in the breeze. Not long since, after only a  few minutes' walk among the trees of Epping Forest, I found I was  decorated with several dozens of these swingers with which I had come  into collision--in this case consisting chiefly of the larvae of the  Green Tortrix Moth (_Tortrix viridana_).    Now let us examine the caterpillar's limbs. Attached to each of the  second, third, and fourth segments is a pair of true walking legs,  corresponding with those of the perfect insect. These are covered with a  hard and shining substance, and are also each provided with a hook. The  fifth and sixth segments have no limbs at all, nor have the eleventh and  twelfth, but some or all of the others (seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth,  and thirteenth) are furnished with a pair of claspers which we shall  presently describe.    First, as regards the number of claspers, it will be seen from what has  just been said that this is not always the same. Some caterpillars  possess five pairs, thus making up the total number of walking  appendages to sixteen. In fact, we must regard this as the _usual_  number. But there are at least a few hundred exceptions to the rule.  Many of the _Bombyces_ (page 217), for example, have only four pairs of  claspers; and in others of the same group the fifth pair is present, but  only partially developed, and quite useless for walking.    Look at the peculiar caterpillar of the Lobster Moth (fig. 23)--a  creature that differs from most other caterpillars not only in its  claspers, but in many other respects too. Observe its long and slender  legs, its humped middle segments, and its upturned hindermost segment,  of enormous size and mounted with a pair of clubbed 'horns.' This last  segment you will observe, has no claspers.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--WALKING LEG OF A CATERPILLAR.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21--LARVA OF THE YELLOW UNDERWING MOTH (_Pronuba_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--LARVA OF THE CRIMSON SPECKLED MOTH  (_Pulchella_).]    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--LARVA OF THE LOBSTER MOTH (_Fagi_).]    Another allied caterpillar is that of the Iron Prominent Moth (fig. 24).  This one also has humped segments, and the claspers of the thirteenth  segment are imperfectly developed.    A large number of other exceptions to the general rule are to be found  in the caterpillars of the Geometer Moths (page 268), one of which is  here represented. These have generally only two pairs of claspers, one  pair on each of the tenth and last segments, so that there is a distance  equal to the combined length of six segments between the hindermost true  leg and the first pair of claspers. But even among the Geometers there  are variations to be observed in the number of claspers, and some of  these will be pointed out in our brief descriptions of the commoner  species.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--CATERPILLAR OF THE IRON PROMINENT MOTH  (_Dromedarius_).]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--LARVA OF THE BRIMSTONE MOTH (_Luteolata_).]    These limbs which we have been calling claspers are known by several  other names. Thus they are termed 'pro-legs,' 'temporary legs,' 'false  legs,' and 'abdominal legs;' but if you watch a caterpillar as it walks  up a stalk or along the edge of a leaf, you will certainly agree that  the term 'clasper' is everything that could be desired. But why not call  them legs, seeing that they are used in walking? The reason is that they  differ in many respects from the three foremost pairs of limbs as  regards structure, persistency, and function. The true legs, as we have  called them, continue to exist, though concealed, in the chrysalis  state, and again appear, far more perfectly developed, in the butterfly  or moth, but the claspers are no more to be seen after the caterpillar  has passed into the quiescent stage. We have noticed, too, that the true  legs are pointed and clawed, also that they are protected by a hard and  horny covering; but examine a large caterpillar, holding it between the  fingers and thumb with its under side uppermost, and you will soon see  that the claspers are not at all hard, but soft and fleshy; not pointed,  but often terminating in a broad flat circular surface. You will also  observe, as the creature struggles to escape from your grasp, and tries  to get a hold on something with its claspers, that these limbs, if we  may so call them, are retractile, and are sometimes completely drawn  into the body. Finally, examine the broad end of a clasper with a  magnifier, and you will see it surrounded by a circle of little hooks,  turning in all directions. You will no longer wonder how it is that a  caterpillar can hold so tenaciously to a piece of twig that it is often  almost impossible to remove it without injury.    Now put your caterpillar down, so that you may observe its gait. If it  happens to be one with the full complement of sixteen limbs, you see  that at each stride it makes but little progress. The segments contract  and relax alternately and in succession, thus sending a series of  wave-like motions along the body, and urging onward the front segments  while the claspers keep the hinder portion firmly fixed.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--THE CLASPERS OF A CATERPILLAR.]    But if your caterpillar is one of the Geometers, with only two, or  perhaps three, pairs of claspers, the mode of procedure is very  different. The creature stretches its body out at full length, often  raising its head high in the air, and swinging its long body right and  left with a most furious motion, as if to hastily scan the  neighbourhood. Then, having satisfied itself as to the _direction_ of  its proposed course (which, by the way, is often changed considerably at  almost every stride), it holds on by the true legs and pulls its hinder  quarters forward till the body forms almost a closed loop, with the  fourth segment nearly touching the ninth. The claspers now become the  holdfasts. The little hooks with which they are provided are firmly  fixed to the surface on which it is walking; and the body being again  straightened out to its utmost length, the same man[oe]uvre is repeated.  So, you see, the insect progresses by strides equal in length to about  six segments of the body, and these the longest segments generally; and  the rate at which the strides succeed each other, especially in some of  the smaller species, is really astonishing.    We have seen the caterpillar in the act of taking its walk, and now we  will give it a twig of its food plant so that we may see it feed. It  walks up the twig without hesitation--for caterpillars (excepting those  which feed on roots) always seem to move upward when in search of  food--and soon finds itself on a leaf. Over this it walks till it  reaches the edge; and, grasping the edge firmly between the claspers, so  as to give perfectly free play to its legs and head, it stretches its  body at full length, and takes a series of bites as it brings its head  backward in a curve. When the head has thus been brought close to its  fore legs, the body is again extended, and the same ground is gone over  again.    If the caterpillar is a fairly large and hardy one, it will bite through  the smaller veins, and perhaps even the larger ones; but the smaller  species often change their position on reaching a moderately thick vein,  and so devour little else than the soft cellular substance of the leaf.  In any case, it is astonishing to see how rapidly the leaf disappears  under the influence of the powerful jaws and marvellous digestive  apparatus of the hungry grub.    Those who take a delight in watching the _movements_ of caterpillars are  sure to be interested in observing them when at rest; for at such times  the various attitudes assumed are as pleasing and instructive as are  their active moments. And these attitudes are all the more interesting  on account of the mimicry by which the creatures often baffle their  numerous enemies. We may profitably spend a little time in studying a  few cases in point.    Many species, when at rest, fix themselves by means of their claspers to  a small twig or leaf stalk, or on the midrib of the leaf itself. Here  they remain perfectly still, with their bodies perfectly straight or  with head slightly raised. I need hardly say that these generally fix  themselves on the _under_ side of the leaves and stalks, thus securing  themselves against the attacks of the feathered foes above. But some  birds are equal to the caterpillars in this matter; and it is really  amusing to see them hopping about beneath the leaves in our gardens,  every now and again slyly turning one eye upward, and smartly plucking  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#9)"],[1," showy among the cattle species. They are of all  colors between a full, deep red, and a pure creamy white; but generally  have both intermixed in larger or smaller patches, or intimately blended  in a beautiful roan. Black, brown, or brindled, are colors not  recognised among pure-bred Short Horns. Their form is well-spread,  symmetrical, and imposing, and capable of sustaining a large weight of  valuable carcass. The horn was originally branching and turned upward,  but now frequently has a downward tendency, with the tips pointing  towards each other. They are light, and comparatively short; clear,  highly polished, and waxy. The head is finely formed, with a longer  face but not so fine a muzzle as the Devon. The neck is delicately  formed without dewlap, the brisket projecting; and the great depth and  width of the chest giving short, well-spread fore-legs. The crops are  good; back and loin broad and flat; ribs projecting; deep flank and  twist; tail well set up, strong at the roots and tapering. They have a  thick covering of soft hair, and are mellow to the touch, technically  termed, _handling well_. They mature early and rapidly for the quantity  of food consumed, yielding largely of good beef with little offal. As a  breed, they are excellent milkers; though some families of the Short  Horns surpass others in this quality. They are inferior to the Devons,  in their value as working oxen, and in the richness of their milk.    [Illustration: A Short-Horn Bull.]    The Short Horns are assigned a high antiquity, by the oldest breeders in  the counties of Durham and Yorkshire, England, the place of their  origin, and for a long time, of their almost exclusive breeding. From  the marked and decided improvement which they stamp upon other animals,  they are evidently an ancient breed, though much the juniors of the  Devon and Hereford. Their highly artificial style, form, and character,  are unquestionably the work of deeply studied and long-continued art;  and to the same degree that they have been moulded in unresisting  compliance with the dictation of their intelligent breeders, have they  departed from that light and more agile form of the Devon, which  conclusively and beyond the possibility of contradiction, marks the more  primitive race.      THE IMPORTATION OF SHORT HORNS INTO THIS COUNTRY.    This is claimed to have been previous to 1783. They are the reputed  ancestors of many choice animals existing in Virginia, in the latter  part of the last century, and which were known as the _milk breed_; and  some of these, with others termed the _beef breed_, were taken into  Kentucky by Mr. Patton, as early as 1797, and their descendants, a  valuable race of animals, were much disseminated in the West, and known  as the _Patton stock_.    The first authentic importations we have recorded, are those of Mr.  Heaton, into Westchester, N. Y., in 1791 and '96, from the valuable  herds of Messrs. Culley and Colling, which consisted of several choice  bulls and cows. These were for many years bred pure, and their progeny  was widely scattered. (_American Herd Book._) They were also imparted  into New York, by Mr. Cox, in 1816; by Mr. Bullock, in 1822; by the late  Hon. S. Van Rensselaer in 1823; and immediately after, by Mr. Charles  Henry Hall, of Harlem. Some small importations were made into  Massachusetts between 1817 and '25, by several enterprising  agriculturists, Messrs. Coolidge, Williams, and others; into Connecticut  by Mr. Hall and others; into Pennsylvania by Mr. Powell; and into Ohio  and some other states, by various individuals early in the present  century.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.    Short-Horned Cow.]    Since the first importations, larger accessions from the best English  herds have been frequently made; and with the nice regard for pedigrees  which the introduction of the herd book, and careful purity in breeding  has produced, the Short Horns have become the most extensive pure-bred  family of cattle in the United States.    During the speculative times of 1835 to 1840, they brought high prices,  frequently from $500 to $1000, and sometimes more. The following years  of financial embarrassment, reduced their market price below their  intrinsic value; but the tide is again turning, and they are now in  demand, but still at prices far below their utility and merits. They  have from the first, been favorites in the rich, corn valleys of the  West, their early maturity and great weight giving them a preference  over any other breed. The only drawback to this partiality, is their  inability, from their form and weight, to reach remote eastern markets  in good condition; an objection now in a great measure remedied, by the  recent remission of duties on foreign beef in the English market, which  makes them of nearly equal value where fed, to pack for exportation. On  light lands and scanty pastures, they will probably never be largely  introduced. All heavy animals require full forage within a limited  compass, so as to fill their stomachs at once, and quietly compose  themselves to their digestion.    The weights reached by the Short Horns in England, as given by Mr.  Berry, have been enormous. Two oxen, six years old, weighed nett, 1820  lbs. each. A heifer of three years, and fed on grass and hay alone,  weighed 1260 lbs. A four-year-old steer, fed on hay and turnips only,  dressed 1890 lbs. A cow reached the prodigious weight of 1778 lbs. A  heifer, running with her dam, and on pasture alone, weighed at seven  months, 476 lbs. An ox, seven years old, weighed 2362 lbs. From their  comparatively small numbers in this country, most of them have been  retained for breeders; few, as yet, have been fattened, and such only as  were decidedly inferior. Such animals as have been extensively produced  by crossing this breed upon our former stocks, have given evidence of  great and decided improvement; and the Short Horns, and their grade  descendants are destined, at no distant day, to occupy a large portion  of the richest feeding grounds in the United States.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.    Hereford Cow]      Herefords.    This is the only remaining pure breed, which has hitherto occupied the  attention of graziers in this country. Like the Devons, they are  supposed to be one of the most ancient races of British cattle. Marshall  gives the following description. \"The countenance pleasant, cheerful,  open; the forehead broad; eye full and lively; horns bright, taper, and  spreading; head small; chap lean; neck long and tapering; chest deep;  bosom broad, and projecting forward; shoulder-bone thin, flat, no way  protuberant in bone (?) but full and mellow in flesh; chest full; loin  broad; hips standing wide, and level with the chine; quarters long, and  wide at the neck; rump even with the level of the back, and not  drooping, nor standing high and sharp above the quarters; tail slender  and neatly haired; barrel round and roomy; the carcass throughout deep  and well spread; ribs broad, standing flat and close on the outer  surface, forming a smooth, even barrel, the hindmost large and full of  length; round-bone small, snug, and not prominent; thigh clean, and  regularly tapering; legs upright and short; bone below the knee and hock  small; feet of middle size; flank large: flesh everywhere mellow,  soft, and yielding pleasantly to the touch, especially on the chine, the  shoulder, and the ribs; hide mellow, supple, of a middle thickness, and  loose on the neck and huckle; coat neatly haired, bright and silky;  color, a middle red, with a bald face characteristic of the true  Herefordshire breed.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 4.    Hereford Bull.]    Youatt further describes them as follows: \"They are usually of a darker  red; some of them are brown, and even yellow, and a few are brindled;  but they are principally distinguished by their white faces, throats,  and bellies. In a few the white extends to the shoulders. The old  Herefords were brown or red-brown, with not a spot of white about them.  It is only within the last fifty or sixty years that it has been the  fashion to breed for white faces. Whatever may be thought of the change  of color, the present breed is certainly far superior to the old one.  The hide is considerably thicker than that of the Devon, and the beasts  are more hardy. Compared with the Devons, they are shorter in the leg,  and also in the carcass; higher, and broader, and heavier in the chine;  rounder and wider across the hips, and better covered with fat; the  thigh fuller and more muscular, and the shoulders larger and coarser.    They are not now much used for husbandry, although their form adapts  them for the heavier work; and they have all the honesty and docility of  the Devon ox, and greater strength, if not his activity. The  Herefordshire ox fattens speedily at a very early age, and it is  therefore more advantageous to the farmer, and perhaps to the country,  that he should go to market at three years old, than be kept longer as a  beast of draught.    They are not as good milkers as the Devons. This is so generally  acknowledged, that while there are many dairies of Devon cows in various  parts of the country, a dairy of Herefords is rarely to be found. To  compensate for this, they are even more kindly feeders than the Devons.  Their beef may be objected to by some as being occasionally a little too  large in the bone, and the fore-quarters being coarse and heavy; but the  meat of the best pieces is often very fine-grained and beautifully  marbled. There are few cattle more prized in the market than the genuine  Herefords.\"    There have been several importations of the Herefords into the United  States, which by crossing with our native cattle, have done great good;  but with the exception of a few fine animals at the South, we are not  aware of their being kept in a state of purity, till the importation of  the splendid herd. within the last six years, by"]]]
