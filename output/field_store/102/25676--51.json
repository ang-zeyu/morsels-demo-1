CHAPTER VI    THE REIGN OF TERROR      The lions seemed to have got a bad fright the night Brock and I sat up  in wait for them in the goods-wagon, for they kept away from Tsavo and  did not molest us in any way for some considerable time--not, in fact,  until long after Brock had left me and gone on safari (a caravan  journey) to Uganda. In this breathing space which they vouchsafed us,  it occurred to me that should they renew their attacks, a trap would  perhaps offer the best chance of getting at them, and that if I could  construct one in which a couple of coolies might be used as bait  without being subjected to any danger, the lions would be quite daring  enough to enter it in search of them and thus be caught. I accordingly  set to work at once, and in a short time managed to make a sufficiently  strong trap out of wooden sleepers, tram-rails, pieces of telegraph  wire, and a length of heavy chain. It was divided into two  compartments--one for the men and one for the lion. A sliding door at  one end admitted the former, and once inside this compartment they were  perfectly safe, as between them and the lion, if he entered the other,  ran a cross wall of iron rails only three inches apart, and embedded  both top and bottom in heavy wooden sleepers. The door which was to  admit the lion was, of course, at the opposite end of the structure,  but otherwise the whole thing was very much on the principle of the  ordinary rat-trap, except that it was not necessary for the lion to  seize the bait in order to send the door clattering down. This part of  the contrivance was arranged in the following manner. A heavy chain was  secured along the top part of the lion's doorway, the ends hanging down  to the ground on either side of the opening; and to these were  fastened, strongly secured by stout wire, short lengths of rails placed  about six inches apart. This made a sort of flexible door which could  be packed into a small space when not in use, and which abutted against  the top of the doorway when lifted up. The door was held in this  position by a lever made of a piece of rail, which in turn was kept in  its place by a wire fastened to one end and passing down to a spring  concealed in the ground inside the cage. As soon as the lion entered  sufficiently far into the trap, he would be bound to tread on the  spring; his weight on this would release the wire, and in an instant  down would come the door behind him; and he could not push it out in  any way, as it fell into a groove between two rails firmly embedded in  the ground.    In making this trap, which cost us a lot of work, we were rather at a  loss for want of tools to bore holes in the rails for the doorway, so  as to enable them to be fastened by the wire to the chain. It occurred  to me, however, that a hard-nosed bullet from my .303 would penetrate  the iron, and on making the experiment I was glad to find that a hole  was made as cleanly as if it had been punched out.    When the trap was ready I pitched a tent over it in order further to  deceive the lions, and built an exceedingly strong boma round it. One  small entrance was made at the back of the enclosure for the men, which  they were to close on going in by pulling a bush after them; and  another entrance just in front of the door of the cage was left open  for the lions. The wiseacres to whom I showed my invention were  generally of the opinion that the man-eaters would be too cunning to  walk into my parlour; but, as will be seen later, their predictions  proved false. For the first few nights I baited the trap myself, but  nothing happened except that I had a very sleepless and uncomfortable  time, and was badly bitten by mosquitoes.    As a matter of fact, it was some months before the lions attacked us  again, though from time to time we heard of their depredations in other  quarters. Not long after our night in the goods-wagon, two men were  carried off from railhead, while another was taken from a place called  Engomani, about ten miles away. Within a very short time, this latter  place was again visited by the brutes, two more men being seized, one  of whom was killed and eaten, and the other so badly mauled that he  died within few days. As I have said, however, we at Tsavo enjoyed  complete immunity from attack, and the coolies, believing that their  dreaded foes had permanently deserted the district, resumed all their  usual habits and occupations, and life in the camps returned to its  normal routine.    At last we were suddenly startled out of this feeling of security. One  dark night the familiar terror-stricken cries and screams awoke the  camps, and we knew that the \"demons\" had returned and had commenced a  new list of victims. On this occasion a number of men had been sleeping  outside their tents for the sake of coolness, thinking, of course, that  the lions had gone for good, when suddenly in the middle of the night  one of the brutes was discovered forcing its way through the boma. The  alarm was at once given, and sticks, stones and firebrands were hurled  in the direction of the intruder. All was of no avail, however, for the  lion burst into the midst of the terrified group, seized an unfortunate  wretch amid the cries and shrieks of his companions, and dragged him  off through the thick thorn fence. He was joined outside by the second  lion, and so daring had the two brutes become that they did not trouble  to carry their victim any further away, but devoured him within thirty  yards of the tent where he had been seized. Although several shots were  fired in their direction by the jemadar of the gang to which the coolie  belonged, they took no notice of these and did not attempt to move  until their horrible meal was finished. The few scattered fragments  that remained of the body I would not allow to be buried at once,  hoping that the lions would return to the spot the following night; and  on the chance of this I took up my station at nightfall in a convenient  tree. Nothing occurred to break the monotony of my watch, however,  except that I had a visit from a hyena, and the next morning I learned  that the lions had attacked another camp about two miles from  Tsavo--for by this time the camps were again scattered, as I had works  in progress all up and down the line. There the man-eaters had been  successful in obtaining a victim, whom, as in the previous instance,  they devoured quite close to the camp. How they forced their way  through the bomas without making a noise was, and still is, a mystery  to me; I should have thought that it was next to impossible for an  animal to get through at all. Yet they continually did so, and without  a sound being heard.    After this occurrence, I sat up every night for over a week near likely  camps, but all in vain. Either the lions saw me and then went  elsewhere, or else I was unlucky, for they took man after man from  different places without ever once giving me a chance of a shot at  them. This constant night watching was most dreary and fatiguing work,  but I felt that it was a duty that had to be undertaken, as the men  naturally looked to me for protection. In the whole of my life I have  never experienced anything more nerve-shaking than to hear the deep  roars of these dreadful monsters growing gradually nearer and nearer,  and to know that some one or other of us was doomed to be their victim  before morning dawned. Once they reached the vicinity of the camps, the  roars completely ceased, and we knew that they were stalking for their  prey. Shouts would then pass from camp to camp, \"Khabar dar, bhaieon,  shaitan ata\" (\"Beware, brothers, the devil is coming\"), but the warning  cries would prove of no avail, and sooner or later agonising shrieks  would break the silence, and another man would be missing from  roll-call next morning.    I was naturally very disheartened at being foiled in this way night  after night, and was soon at my wits' end to know what to do; it seemed  as if the lions were really \"devils\" after all and bore a charmed life.  As I have said before, tracking them through the jungle was a hopeless  task; but as something had to be done to keep up the men's spirits, I  spent many a weary day crawling on my hands and knees through the dense  undergrowth of the exasperating wilderness around us. As a matter of  fact, if I had come up with the lions on any of these expeditions, it  was much more likely that they would have added me to their list of  victims than that I should have succeeded in killing either of them, as  everything would have been in their favour. About this time, too, I had  many helpers, and several officers--civil, naval and military--came to  Tsavo from the coast and sat up night after night in order to get a  shot at our daring foes. All of us, however, met with the same lack of  success, and the lions always seemed capable of avoiding the watchers,  while succeeding, at the same time in obtaining a victim.    I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the  brutes seized a man from the railway station and brought him close to  my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and  the sound of their dreadful purring filled the air and rang in my ears  for days afterwards. The terrible thing was to feel so helpless; it was  useless to attempt to go out, as of course the poor fellow was dead,  and in addition it was so pitch dark as to make it impossible to see  anything. Some half a dozen workmen, who lived in a small enclosure  close to mine, became so terrified on hearing the lions at their meal  that they shouted and implored me to allow them to come inside my boma.  This I willingly did, but soon afterwards I remembered that one man had  been lying ill in their camp, and on making enquiry I found that they  had callously left him behind alone.

This unhappy period  brought, however, with all its evils, blessings in its train, and  Henry VII. not only did more for the advancement of the wool-trade  than his predecessors, but also gave it greater vigour than it could  lay claim to at any former period. Fine cloths were much improved in  his reign, and luxury began to be attended to in an article, which,  till then, had only been rendered amenable to comfort. The  ostentatious reign of Henry VIII., gave an additional impulse to the  trade, and cloth was sold in 1512 for five merks, which fifty years  before would only have brought about forty shillings; while, in  consequence of increasing wealth, population, and consumption, the  demand was materially increased. A new market was also opened up for  the exit of their woollens, by the establishment of an intercourse in  1516 with several islands in the Archipelago, and a few of the towns  on the coast of Syria.    Edward VI., or rather his ministers, for he was then a minor,  attempted to lay a poll-tax upon sheep, every ewe kept in a separate  pasture being charged threepence, every wedder twopence, and all sheep  kept on commons three-halfpence; but it was found to be so oppressive,  so annoying to the people, and so difficult to collect, that it was  repealed during the next year. England made a distinguished figure in  this reign as a commercial nation. The manufacture of woollens was  raised to a great height. Cloth, besides being exported to Flanders,  found its way to Holland, Hamburgh, Sweden, and Russia, whose coarse  warm stuffs were very much wanted, and the trade wore such an air of  affluence, that a tax of eightpence in the pound was laid upon all  cloth made for sale in England. This, however, was speedily repealed,  a very short time serving to point out, that, though made for an  endurance of three prosperous years, the people who were galled by a  trifling impost on their sheep, would not, unless under very  favourable circumstances, submit to imposts on the fabrics which they  wore.    During the reigns of Henry VII., Henry VIII., and Edward VI., an undue  preference was given to grazing. Acts were framed to put a stop to  this mismanagement, which was fast ruining the country, by driving  people from it. Henry VII. exempted Norwich from the penalties of the  law, on account of the decay of manufactures from the want of hands;  and shortly after the whole county of Norfolk obtained a like  exemption in regard to some branches of the woollen trade. The  practice of depopulating the country, by abandoning tillage, and  throwing the lands into pasturage, had run to so great an extent in  the time of Henry VIII., that an enactment was made, whereby the king  became entitled to half the rents of the land where any farm-houses  were allowed to fall to decay. The number of sheep in a flock was at  the same time limited to two thousand. Hume conjectures, in his  _History of England_, that unskilful husbandry was probably the cause  why the proprietors found no profit in tillage;--thus leading a farmer  to keep a flock sometimes of twenty-four thousand as expressed in the  statute. This had the effect of increasing the price of mutton, a  remarkable coincidence, which parliament attributes to the commodity  having gotten into few hands, though Hume ascribes it to the daily  increase of money, thinking it almost impossible that such an article  could be engrossed. At the commencement of the reign of Edward VI.,  the people were still sadly deficient in a knowledge of agriculture--a  profession, which, as Hume wisely remarks, of all employments,  requires the most reflection and experience. A great demand having  arisen for wool both at home and abroad, whole estates were laid  waste, while the tenants, regarded as a useless burden, were expelled  their habitations, and the cottagers deprived even of the commons on  which they fed their cows; no wonder there was a decay of the people!    (47.) _Wool Trade encouraged by Elizabeth._--Elizabeth extended her  protection to the Protestants who fled from the persecutions of the  Duke of Alva in the Low Countries, and the woollen manufactories  became more flourishing than ever--so much so, that, although in 1552,  a large quantity of raw material was exported, yet in less than thirty  years, the people of Germany, Poland, France, Flanders, Denmark, and  Sweden, were covered with British cloths; two hundred thousand pieces  being annually exported, though the price was nearly tripled. At that  time the processes by which woollens are rendered beautiful were  unknown in England, and as our exports consisted in white undressed  cloth, the profits upon dyeing and finishing, amounting to nearly a  million a year, were lost. This was attempted to be remedied by  prohibiting the exportation of white cloths, but the Dutch and  Germans, who benefitted by the dyeing processes, forbade the entrance  of any English woollens dyed in the piece, into their territories, and  the export consequently fell immediately from 200,000 to sixty pieces.  Then the restriction was taken off. It was at this crisis that the  fabrication of medley cloths, or mixtures of wool dyed of different  colours and wrought into the same web, was commenced.    (48.) _Woollen Cloth monopolized by the merchant adventurers._--Though  nine-tenths of the commerce of the kingdom consisted in the time of  James I. of woollen goods, wool was allowed to be exported till the  nineteenth year of his reign, when it was forbidden by proclamation,  but never strictly enforced. The cloth was very little admired even at  home, and though it was the staple commodity of the realm, a company  of merchant adventurers were allowed by a patent, to possess the sole  disposal of it. Elizabeth at one time attempted to rescue this  important trade from the hands of these merchants, but they instantly  conspired, and ceased to make purchases of cloth, when the queen was  necessitated to restore the patent. A board of trade was brought  together by James I. in 1622, and one of the purposes contemplated was  to remedy the low price of wool, which was leading the people to  complain of the decay of the woollen manufacture; but Hume supposes,  and with every appearance of probability, that this fall of prices  proceeded from an increase of wool.    (49.) _English consumption of Wool increased._--Till the fifteenth  century our wool was sold in the fleece to such as came to buy it.  Among the principal of our customers were numbered the Flemings, and  Brabanters, and in particular the merchants of Ghent, and Louvain, who  took off vast quantities for the supply of two manufactories, that had  flourished in those cities from the tenth century, and had furnished  the greater part of Europe, and even England itself, with every kind  of woollen cloth. Thus they might have continued, to the great loss  of our island, had not the democratic hands employed in those  manufactories repeatedly revolted, owing to their determination to  resist a tax on looms, and being at length punished and dispersed,  found their way in no long time to Holland. While in the last place,  the spirit of sedition still being dominant, certain of their party  attacked and killed some of the civil authorities, for which they had  to make a precipitate flight to England, where they settled as  peaceful citizens, and instructed our people in the working of wool.  This occurred in 1420, from which time neither skill, money, nor  enactments, have been spared to enable us to retain so valuable a  trade. In the reign of Edward IV., every pack of English wool was  liable when exported to a custom of 50s., a goodly sum in those days,  and one which brought a yearly revenue of L 250,000. This excessive  custom, almost amounting to a prohibition, added to the above  mentioned opportunities, in a manner compelled the people to  manufacture for themselves, and in this they succeeded so well, that  by the time of Elizabeth, the exportation of live sheep and wool was  prohibited on pain of having the right hand struck off. It does not  appear that this enactment was ever repealed, though supposed to be so  by the 12th of Charles II. cap. 32, see. 3, which, without taking away  the penalties imposed by former statutes, imposes a new penalty;--20s.  for every sheep exported, or attempted to be exported, together with  the forfeiture of the sheep.    (50.) _Severity of prohibitory enactments reprobated._--By the 14th of  Charles II. chap. 18 the exportation of wool was deemed felony, and  punished accordingly. This tended in no slight degree to the defeat of  the ends intended, by hindering all who were not cold-blooded from  bringing to justice the actors in so trifling an offence. This was  soon however seen through, and corrected, by the 7th and 8th of  William III. chap. 28, sec. 4, in which it was declared, that \"Whereas  the statute of the 13th and 14th of King Charles II., made against the  exportation of wool, among other things in the said act mentioned,  doth enact the same to be deemed felony, by the severity of which  penalty the prosecution of offenders hath not been so effectually put  into execution; be it therefore enacted, by the authority aforesaid,  that so much of the said act, which relates to the making the said  offence felony, be repealed and made void.\"    Adam Smith, when commenting in his \"Wealth of Nations,\" on the laws  relating to wool, reprobates severely the ill-judged compliance of our  government, in yielding to the solicitation of our merchants, and  allowing them to sway with iron rule the commerce of the world. \"The  severity of many of the"]]]
