The  lenses are focused, _i. e._ brought to the right distance from the  object viewed, by sliding the cork up and down on the rod.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The object rests on a piece of glass laid over the hole in the top of  the box. A piece of wood covered with white paper and placed below the  object at an angle of about forty-five degrees answers for a reflector  to illuminate those objects through which the light can pass. The pure  white surface is better for the purpose than a mirror.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The most delicate part of the construction is making the holes in the  corks for the rod to slide through. This may be done perfectly, however,  by making the holes with a rat-tail file, trying the rod now and then  until it moves just right. The best thing for the rod is a piece of  brass wire one quarter of an inch thick; a lead pencil however is a good  substitute. Before bending the end of the brass wire arm it is well to  heat it red-hot at the point of bending, to take out the temper: as  otherwise it may break. The holes in the handle of the magnifier should  be drilled as near the front as possible and so arranged that when the  magnifier is in position the smallest lens will be near the object.      [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    The mounted needles are shown in _fig. 3_. One pair of each kind will be  enough to start with. To make one, take a fine needle, break off about a  third, so it will not be too long and springy; then with a pair of  pincers force it into the handle point first, withdraw it and finally  force it in again with the point out. It may be easily bent with the  pincers by first heating it to redness in a flame. When bent, heat it  red once more and plunge quickly into water to re-temper it. Rubbing on  an oil stone may be necessary to remove roughness. Should the handles  show any tendency to split, it would be well to wrap the end tightly  with waxed thread.    The forceps (_fig. 4_) may be purchased either of brass or steel at no  great expense. Although not necessary it is more convenient to have them  curved than straight.      [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    If the reader will carefully follow the directions given below and  endeavor to see for himself all the parts spoken of, he will probably  have very little difficulty afterward in the use of the instruments just  described; and the enjoyment he will have when he has learned how to  examine little things, will amply repay for careful and persistent  efforts at the start. Get a Dandelion in full bloom and also one that  has gone to seed.    Have the microscope and the other instruments ready for use. The best  place to work is on a table in front of a window where there is plenty  of light, but not the direct rays of the sun.    Now cut the blossom in halves from the stem up. It will be seen that the  stem is hollow and ends above in a cushion-like expansion. From the  upper surface of this grow a number of little flowers, while from the  sides there sprang two rows of little green organs that enclose the  flower cluster like a cup. Remove one of the flowers with the forceps  and place it in a drop of water on the glass stage of the microscope.  Examine with one and one half inch power.[A]    Be careful to get just the focus. You are now ready to see the general  form of the flower. At the base is a little body with roughened sides  and slightly narrowed above (the ovary). Springing from the top of the  ovary are a number of fine bristles (the pappus). Inside the bristles is  a yellow portion, tubular below and flat above (the corolla).  Projecting from the tube of the corolla is a little yellow rod (the top  of the stamens joined together); and coming from among the stamens are  two slender recurved organs (the stigmas).    Now take a mounted needle in each hand and holding one needle on the  flat part of the corolla split open the tubular part with the other. By  keeping the lower part spread open with the needles, you will see that a  number of delicate yellow threads grow from the sides of the corolla and  are connected with the yellow stamen rod. These threads are another part  of the stamens. In the middle of the flower is a single thread-like  organ (the style) which comes from the top of the ovary and passing  through the stamens projects beyond them, divided into two stigmas.    Most of my readers have probably studied enough botany to know the names  of the different parts of a flower, but very likely many of them do not  recognize the parts of the Dandelion flower as looking anything like the  parts of the flower with which they are familiar.    Before proceeding further, therefore let us take a Morning-Glory  flower--which you all know and can easily obtain, or at least some  flower like it--and let us see that the parts of the two correspond.    Commencing in the centre we find in both a pistil, consisting of an  ovary at the base and a stigma at the top and a style between. In the  Dandelion the stigma is split in halves, while in the morning-glory it  is not split but has three little knobs. Around the pistil come the  stamens in each case. Each stamen is composed of two parts: a slender  stem (the filament) and a little sac at the end (the anther) which is  filled with pollen dust. In both cases the filaments grow out of the  sides of the corolla. But while in the Morning-Glory the anthers are  entirely free from one another, in the Dandelion they are joined  together by their sides and form a tube around the style. The corolla in  both cases is all of one piece, but in the Dandelion it is as if the  upper part of the corolla were split open one side and then made flat.  Instead of a green calyx as in the Morning-Glory, the Dandelion has a  number of delicate white bristles. And, finally, in the Morning-Glory  both the calyx and corolla grow out from below the ovary, while in the  Dandelion its calyx of bristles and its corolla issue from above the  ovary. So after all, you will see that corresponding organs are in both,  and the difference between the two flowers is not so great as one might  think at first.    Let the different parts of the Dandelion be examined now more minutely.  First take some of the bristles and examine them with one quarter inch  power. They are not perfectly smooth, but are more or less saw-like on  the edge. With the same power look at other parts of the flower; notice  the hairiness of the stigmas, the pollen grains coming out of the  anthers (some grains may be found on the stigmas) also the roughness of  the ovary and the delicate ribs or veins in the corolla. Examine one of  the seed-like fruits with one and one half inch power. It is a ripened  ovary. Compare the fruit with the ovary of a flower. The nutlet has  become hard, rougher and more strongly ribbed. The narrowed upper part  of the ovary has become much elongated and the pappus is spread out like  an inverted umbrella.    Examine some bristles with one quarter inch power. They show the  saw-like edges much more developed than in the younger bristles of the  flower. We see throughout a beautiful adaptation of every part for  fitting the little parachute to be carried long distances by the wind  and finally to catch on some suitable place in which to sprout.      XIV.--HOW TO SEE A BUMBLE BEE.    You will first need to catch your Bumble Bee. A little chloroform poured  on one will kill it instantly. Make a general examination at the outset  of the insect. The outside of the body is horny and covered thickly with  hairs. On the upper side the hairs are much more numerous than on the  under side. The whole body is divided into three regions: the head,  bearing the feelers and mouth-parts; a middle part (thorax) bearing the  four wings and six legs; and a hind part (abdomen) armed with the sting.    Remove the head and examine with one and one half inch power. At the  sides are two prominent oval bodies (compound eyes) which seem to be  crossed by five lines; near the top of the head, between the compound  eyes, are three little shiny bead-like organs (simple eyes); starting  from about the middle of the face are the two feelers (antennae) and at  the lower part of the head are the mouth-parts. The sides, top and front  of the head are all covered with hair.    Examine one of the compound eyes with one fourth inch power. The surface  is made up of innumerable little facets, something like a cut diamond.    Cut off a piece of one of the compound eyes, remove some of the black  pigment on the back and examine the piece in a drop of water. Each facet  is a tiny hexagon. Some care is necessary to see them well.    Remove an antenna and examine it with three fourths inch power. It is  thickly covered with minute hairs which give it a velvety appearance.  Count the joints. At the base is the longest joint; at the lower end of  which is a little knob that fits into a socket in the head. The next  joint is quite small while those beyond are much alike.    Scrape the hairs from the face and examine the horny shell with three  fourths inch power. The surface is full of little pits. In the upper  part of the face there is a groove, in the middle of which is one of  the simple eyes. Just below the antennae sockets is a groove which  extends crosswise a short distance on either side and then bends  downwards to the mouth. The portion of the face bounded by this groove  is called the clypeus. At its lower part is hinged a little oblong piece  (labium) which may be moved up and down with a needle.    Melt a piece of sealing wax on the centre of a slip of glass (taking  care not to break the glass by too sudden heating) and before the wax  hardens press the head into it face downwards.    Examine with one inch power. The hole near the top of the head shows the  position of the neck. The portion of the head around this hole is  destitute of hairs and is hollowed in, to make room for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#9)"],[1,"on a  limestone cliff by Walter W.

If this salamander is restricted  to this type of habitat, it should be found in the region of extensive  limestone outcroppings in northern Chiapas and southern Tabasco.      =Rhinophrynus dorsalis= Dumeril and Bibron         _Oaxaca_: Ixtepec; Limon; Salina Cruz (18); Tehuantepec       (57); Tuxtepec (3). _Veracruz_: Amatitlan (3); Cosamaloapan       (5); Novillero (2); San Lorenzo.    This species inhabits the scrub forests of the Pacific coastal plain  and the savannas in southern Veracruz; apparently it does not occur in  rainforest. Consequently, its distribution in the isthmus is  discontinuous.    PLATE 1    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Savanna about 75 kilometers east of  Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. Photograph by L. C.

Clasping pair of _Diaglena reticulata_ at the  edge of a pond north of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, on July 6, 1958. x 1.]    Breeding congregations were found after heavy rains at Tehuantepec on  July 5, 1956, at Cosamaloapan, Novillero, and Amatitlan on July 26,  1956, and at Salina Cruz on July 6, 1958. The call is a long \"worrp\"  made while the male is floating on the surface of the pond. The small  heads, small limbs, and greatly inflated bodies cause the calling males  to resemble miniature caricature balloons (Pl. 6, fig. 1). Amplexus is  inguinal. These toads are notably wary, even when calling. Often the  beam of a flashlight or the slightest disturbance of the water will  cause the males to stop calling. The body is deflated with one last  nauseous note, and the frog sinks beneath the surface of the water and  swims away with short slow kicks of the hind feet.      =Bufo canaliferus= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Chivela; Salina Cruz; Santa Efigenia; Tapanatepec       (6); Tehuantepec (10); Zanatepec (4).    This small toad apparently is restricted to the Pacific lowlands from  the Isthmus of Tehuantepec eastward to Guatemala. At Zanatepec on July  13, 1956, males were calling from a flooded field bordered by scrub  forest. The call is a rather loud nasal racket. Living individuals vary  greatly in coloration. Some have yellowish tan flanks and dorsum and an  orange middorsal stripe; others have a pale red dorsum, yellow flanks,  and a cream middorsal stripe (Pl. 6, fig. 2).      =Bufo coccifer= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Juchitan (5); Tehuantepec.    It is with some degree of hesitancy that these toads are referred to  the species _coccifer_. Although these and other specimens from  Guerrero and Michoacan display no striking differences from specimens  from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and southeastern Guatemala, the ranges of  the populations are separated by a broad hiatus in Chiapas and  Guatemala. Possibly this species has utilized the sub-humid corridor  through northern Central America (Stuart, 1954) and subsequently  disappeared from the corridor in Guatemala and Chiapas. Specimens of a  _coccifer_-like toad collected by Stuart in the vicinity of  Jacaltenango, Departamento Huehuetenango, Guatemala, are much larger  than either the Central American or Mexican specimens of _coccifer_. A  final commitment on the systematic status must await a thorough study  of this group of toads.    Males of this species were calling from a grassy rain-pool in open  scrub forest at the edge of Juchitan on July 6, 1956. The call is a  low \"whirrr.\" The calling males were sitting in the shallow water at  the edge of pond, where they were hidden by the grass. None was  observed in open water, as is characteristic of calling males of _Bufo  canaliferus_ and _marmoreus_.      =Bufo marinus= Linnaeus         _Oaxaca_: Agua Caliente; Guichicovi (3); Mixtequilla;       Tolosita (6); Tehuantepec (37); Tuxtepec; Union Hidalgo.       _Veracruz_: Ciudad Aleman (4); Cosamaloapan; Cuatotolapam       (19); 20 km. SE of Jesus Carranza (4); 38 km. SE of Jesus       Carranza (10); 20 km. NE of Jesus Carranza (4); Novillero.    This large toad is abundant throughout the lowlands of the isthmus. The  loud rattling call of males was heard on rainy nights throughout the  summer. In March, 1956, several adults were found in a small cave back  of a spring at Agua Caliente.      =Bufo marmoreus= Wiegmann         _Oaxaca_: Cerro San Pedro (2); Chivela (5); Escurano (3);       Juchitan; Salina Cruz (101); Santa Lucia (2); 12 km. S of       Santiago Chivela (11); Santo Domingo; Tapanatepec;       Tehuantepec (100); Tequisistlan. _Veracruz_: Alvarado;       Coatzacoalcos.    This toad is abundant on the Pacific lowlands, where it inhabits both  open and dense scrub forest. On the Gulf lowlands its distribution  seems to be limited to xeric coastal habitats. Aside from the specimens  from Alvarado and Coatzacoalcos, it is known in Veracruz only from Boca  del Rio (Langebartel and Smith, 1959:27).    The similarity in size of _Bufo marmoreus_ and _valliceps_ and their  almost completely allopatric ranges suggest that the two species may be  in competition at any one locality. Nevertheless, both were calling  from a small rocky stream south of Santiago Chivela on July 6, 1956.    On the night of July 6, 1958, an estimated 400 toads of this species  made up a breeding congregation near Salina Cruz. The site was a  shallow muddy pond about 20 x 40 meters located in an area cleared of  scrub forest; the banks of the pond were devoid of vegetation (Pl. 5,  fig. 2). Breeding in the same pond were _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_ and  _Diaglena reticulata_. The following morning no more than a dozen  _Bufo_ were found in the pond, but several individuals were found  beneath debris and in small burrows near the pond. On July 7, 1958,  large numbers of tadpoles and recently metamorphosed young were in a  shallow grassy pool just east of Salina Cruz.    Taylor (1943b:347) referred certain specimens from Tehuantepec to _Bufo  perplexus_, a species closely related to _Bufo marmoreus_. Evidence to  be presented elsewhere shows that _perplexus_ does not occur in the  isthmus.      =Bufo valliceps valliceps= Wiegmann         _Oaxaca_: Guichicovi (2); Matias Romero; 32 km. N of Matias       Romero (2); Nueva Raza; Rio Sarabia (3); Santa Maria       Chimalapa (14); Santiago Chivela; 12 km. S of Santiago       Chivela (5); Santo Domingo (5); Tolosita (7). _Veracruz_:       Acayucan (3); Alvarado; Amatitlan; Ayentes; Cosamaloapan       (3); Cosoleacaque (6); Cuatotolapam (14); Hueyapan; 20 km.       ENE of Jesus Carranza (6); 20 km. S of Jesus Carranza; 25       km. SE of Jesus Carranza (23); 35 km. SE of Jesus Carranza;       60 km. SW of Jesus Carranza (5); La Oaxaquena (4); Novillero       (4); San Lorenzo (5).    Individuals were found in both wet and dry seasons. In the dry season  they were most frequently found in rainforest, whereas in the rainy  season breeding congregations were found in savannas as well. This toad  occurs throughout the Gulf lowlands and on the Pacific slopes and in  the Grijalva Valley of Chiapas and Guatemala, but not on the Pacific  lowlands of the isthmus.    I have not been able to recognize individuals referrable to the race  _macrocristatus_. Firschein and Smith (1957:219) described  _macrocristatus_ from the mountains of eastern Oaxaca and referred to  it specimens from the Gulf lowlands of northern Chiapas. None of the  present material shows the hypertrophied cranial crests supposedly  characteristic of _macroaristatus_, nor do specimens from the isthmus  resemble the population in the Grijalva Valley being described by L. C.  Stuart, who will discuss the variation in, and the validity of, the  named populations of _valliceps_.    Five specimens from San Lorenzo, Veracruz (USNM 123516-20), were  identified as _Bufo cristatus_ by Smith (1947:408). Firschein (1950:83)  redefined the _cristatus_ group of _Bufo_ and assigned these specimens  to _valliceps_.      =Eleutherodactylus alfredi= Boulenger         _Oaxaca_: Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesus       Carranza (6).    These specimens were collected in rainforest. Shreve (1957:247) pointed  out the close resemblance between _E. alfredi_ and _E. conspicuus_ from  Piedras Negras, Guatemala, and treated them as subspecies. Examination  of "]]]
