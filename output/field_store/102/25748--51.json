[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#9)"],[1,"of its history  involves an understanding of its environment and above all of its  past.  Theoretically one may deny that past, as did the men of  the Revolution, as many men of the present day have done, but its  influence remains indestructible.    In the past, built up by slow accumulations of centuries, was  formed the aggregation of thoughts, sentiments, traditions, and  prejudices constituting the national mind which makes the  strength of a race.  Without it no progress is possible.  Each  generation would necessitate a fresh beginning.    The aggregate composing the soul of a people is solidly  established only if it possesses a certain rigidity, but this  rigidity must not pass a certain limit, or there would be no such  thing as malleability.    Without rigidity the ancestral soul would have no fixity, and  without malleability it could not adapt itself to the changes of  environment resulting from the progress of civilization.    Excessive malleability of the national mind impels a people to  incessant revolutions.  Excess of rigidity leads it to  decadence.  Living species, like the races of humanity, disappear  when, too fixedly established by a long past, they become  incapable of adapting themselves to new conditions of existence.    Few peoples have succeeded in effecting a just equilibrium  between these two contrary qualities of stability and  malleability.  The Romans in antiquity and the English in modern  times may be cited among those who have best attained it.    The peoples whose mind is most fixed and established often effect  the most violent revolutions.  Not having succeeded in evolving  progressively, in adapting themselves to changes of environment,  they are forced to adapt themselves violently when such  adaptation becomes indispensable.    Stability is only acquired very slowly.  The history of a race is  above all the story of its long efforts to establish its mind.  So long as it has not succeeded it forms a horde of barbarians  without cohesion and strength.  After the invasions of the end of  the Roman Empire France took several centuries to form a national  soul.    She finally achieved one; but in the course of centuries this  soul finally became too rigid.  With a little more malleability,  the ancient monarchy would have been slowly transformed as it was  elsewhere, and we should have avoided, together with the  Revolution and its consequences, the heavy task of remaking a  national soul.    The preceding considerations show us the part of race in the  genesis of revolutions, and explain why the same revolutions will  produce such different effects in different countries; why, for  example, the ideas of the French Revolution, welcomed with  such enthusiasm by some peoples, were rejected by others.    Certainly England, although a very stable country, has suffered  two revolutions and slain a king; but the mould of her mental  armour was at once stable enough to retain the acquisitions of  the past and malleable enough to modify them only within the  necessary limits.  Never did England dream, as did the men of the  French Revolution, of destroying the ancestral heritage in order  to erect a new society in the name of reason.    ``While the Frenchman,'' writes M. A. Sorel, ``despised his  government, detested his clergy, hated the nobility, and revolted  against the laws, the Englishman was proud of his religion, his  constitution, his aristocracy, his House of Lords.  These were  like so many towers of the formidable Bastille in which he  entrenched himself, under the British standard, to judge Europe  and cover her with contempt.  He admitted that the command was  disputed inside the fort, but no stranger must approach.''    The influence of race in the destiny of the peoples appears  plainly in the history of the perpetual revolutions of the  Spanish republics of South America.  Composed of half-castes,  that is to say, of individuals whose diverse heredities have  dissociated their ancestral characteristics, these populations  have no national soul and therefore no stability.  A people of  half-castes is always ungovernable.    If we would learn more of the differences of political capacity  which the racial factor creates we must examine the same nation  as governed by two races successively.    The event is not rare in history.  It has been manifested in a  striking manner of late in Cuba and the Philippines, which passed  suddenly from the rule of Spain to that of the United States.    We know in what anarchy and poverty Cuba existed under Spanish  rule; we know, too, to what a degree of prosperity the island was  brought in a few years when it fell into the hands of the United  States.    The same experience was repeated in the Philippines, which for  centuries had been governed by Spain.  Finally the country was no  more than a vast jungle, the home of epidemics of every kind,  where a miserable population vegetated without commerce or  industry.  After a few years of American rule the country was  entirely transformed: malaria, yellow fever, plague and cholera  had entirely disappeared.  The swamps were drained; the country  was covered with railways, factories and schools.  In thirteen  years the mortality was reduced by two-thirds.    It is to such examples that we must refer the theorist who has  not yet grasped the profound significance of the word race, and  how far the ancestral soul of a people rules over its destiny.      2.  How the people regards Revolution.      The part of the people has been the same in all revolutions.  It  is never the people that conceives them nor directs them.  Its  activity is released by means of leaders.    Only when the direct interests of the people are involved do we  see, as recently in Champagne, any fraction of the people rising  spontaneously.  A movement thus localised constitutes a mere  riot.    Revolution is easy when the leaders are very influential.  Of  this Portugal and Brazil have recently furnished proofs.  But new  ideas penetrate the people very slowly indeed.  Generally it  accepts a revolution without knowing why, and when by chance it  does succeed in understanding why, the revolution is over long  ago.    The people will create a revolution because it is persuaded to do  so, but it does not understand very much of the ideas of its  leaders; it interprets them in its own fashion, and this fashion  is by no means that of the true authors of the revolution.  The  French Revolution furnished a striking example of this fact.    The Revolution of 1789 had as its real object the substitution of  the power of the nobility by that of the bourgeoisie; that is,  an old elite which had become incapable was to be replaced  by a new elite which did possess capacity.    There was little question of the people in this first phase of  the Revolution.  The sovereignty of the people was proclaimed,  but it amounted only to the right of electing its  representatives.    Extremely illiterate, not hoping, like the middle classes, to  ascend the social scale, not in any way feeling itself the equal  of the nobles, and not aspiring ever to become their equal, the  people had views and interests very different to those of the  upper classes of society.    The struggles of the assembly with the royal power led it to call  for the intervention of the people in these struggles.  It  intervened more and more, and the bourgeois revolution rapidly  became a popular revolution.    An idea having no force of its own, and acting only by virtue of  possessing an affective and mystic substratum which supports it,  the theoretical ideas of the bourgeoisie, before they could act  on the people, had to be transformed into a new and very definite  faith, springing from obvious practical interests.    This transformation was rapidly effected when the people heard  the men envisaged by it as the Government assuring it that it was  the equal of its former masters.  It began to regard itself as a  victim, and proceeded to pillage, burn, and massacre, imagining  that in so doing it was exercising a right.    The great strength of the revolutionary principles was that they  gave a free course to the instincts of primitive barbarity which  had been restrained by the secular and inhibitory action of  environment, tradition, and law.    All the social bonds that formerly contained the multitude were  day by day dissolving, so that it conceived a notion of unlimited  power, and the joy of seeing its ancient masters ferreted out and  despoiled.  Having become the sovereign people, were not all  things permissible to it?    The motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, a true manifestation  of hope and faith at the beginning of the Revolution, soon merely  served to cover a legal justification of the sentiments of  jealousy, cupidity, and hatred of superiors, the true motives of  crowds unrestrained by discipline.  This is why the Revolution so  soon ended in disorder, violence, and anarchy.    From the moment when the Revolution descended from the middle to  the lower classes of society, it ceased to be a domination of the  instinctive by the rational, and became, on the contrary,  the effort of the instinctive to overpower the rational.    This legal triumph of the atavistic instincts was terrible.  The  whole effort of societies an effort indispensable to their  continued existence--had always been to restrain, thanks to the  power of tradition, customs, and codes, certain natural instincts  which man has inherited from his primitive animality.  It is  possible to dominate them--and the more a people does overcome  them the more civilised it is--but they cannot be destroyed.  The  influence of various exciting causes will readily result in their  reappearance.    This is why the liberation of popular passions is so dangerous.  The torrent, once escaped from its bed, does not return until it  has spread devastation far and wide.  ``Woe to him who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#9)"],[1," this  number soon increased to one thousand. The disciples were filled  with joy and gladness; while rage and lying was abundantly  manifested by gainsayers; faith was strong, joy was great, and  persecution heavy.    We proceeded to ordain Sidney Rigdon, Isaac Morley, John  Murdock, Lyman Wight, Edward Partridge and many others to the  ministry; and, leaving them to take care of the churches and to  minister the gospel, we took leave of the saints and continued our  journey.    Fifty miles west of Kirtland, we had occasion to pass through  the neighborhood where I first settled in the wilderness, after my  marriage. We found the people all excited with the news of the  great work we had been the humble instruments of doing in Kirtland  and vicinity. Some wished to learn and obey the fullness of the  gospel--were ready to entertain us and hear us preach. Others were  filled with envy, rage and lying.    We had stopped for the night at the house of Simeon Carter, by  whom we were kindly received, and were in the act of reading to him  and explaining the Book of Mormon, when there came a knock at the  door, and an officer entered with a warrant from a magistrate by  the name of Byington, to arrest me on a very frivolous charge. I  dropped the Book of Mormon in Carter's house, and went with him  some two miles, in a dark, muddy road; one of the brethren  accompanied me. We arrived at the place of trial late in the  evening; found false witnesses in attendance, and a Judge who  boasted of his intention to thrust us into prison, for the purpose  of testing the powers of our apostleship, as he called it; although  I was only an Elder in the Church. The Judge boasting thus, and the  witnesses being entirely false in their testimony, concluded to  make no defense, but to treat the whole matter with contempt.    I was soon ordered to prison, or to pay a sum of money which I  had not in the world. It was now a late hour, and I was still  retained in court, tantalized, abused and urged to settle the  matter, to all of which I made no reply for some time. This greatly  exhausted their patience. It was near midnight. I now called on  brother Petersen to sing a hymn in the court. We sung, \"O how happy  are they.\" This exasperated them still more, and they pressed us  greatly to settle the business, by paying the money.    I then observed as follows: \"May it please the court, I have one  proposal to make for a final settlement of the things that seem to  trouble you. It is this: if the witnesses who have given testimony  in the case will repent of their false swearing, and the magistrate  of his unjust and wicked judgment and of his persecution,  blackguardism and abuse, and all kneel down together, we will pray  for you, that God might forgive you in these matters.\"    \"My big bull dog pray for me,\" says that Judge.    \"The devil help us,\" exclaimed another.    They now urged me for some time to pay the money; but got no  further answer.    The court adjourned, and I was conducted to a public house over  the way, and locked in till morning; the prison being some miles  distant.    In the morning the officer appeared and took me to breakfast;  this over, we sat waiting in the inn for all things to be ready to  conduct me to prison. In the meantime my fellow travellers came  past on their journey, and called to see me. I told them in an  undertone to pursue their journey and leave me to manage my own  affairs, promising to overtake them soon. They did so. After  sitting awhile by the fire in charge of the officer, I requested to  step out. I walked out into the public square accompanied by him.  Said I, \"Mr. Peabody, are you good at a race?\" \"No,\" said he, \"but  my big bull dog is, and he has been trained to assist me in my  office these several years; he will take any man down at my  bidding. Well, Mr. Peabody, you compelled me to go a mile, I have  gone with you two miles. You have given me an opportunity to  preach, sing, and have also entertained me with lodging and  breakfast. I must now go on my journey; if you are good at a race  you can accompany me. I thank you for all your kindness--good day,  sir.\"    I then started on my journey, while he stood amazed and not able  to step one foot before the other. Seeing this, I halted, turned to  him and again invited him to a race. He still stood amazed. I then  renewed my exertions, and soon increased my speed to something like  that of a deer. He did not awake from his astonishment sufficiently  to start in pursuit till I had gained, perhaps, two hundred yards.  I had already leaped a fence, and was making my way through a field  to the forest on the right of the road. He now came hallowing after  me, and shouting to his dog to seize me. The dog, being one of the  largest I ever saw, came close on my footsteps with all his fury;  the officer behind still in pursuit, clapping his hands and  hallooing, \"stu-boy, stu-boy--take him--watch--lay hold of him, I  say--down with him,\" and pointing his finger in the direction I was  running. The dog was fast overtaking me, and in the act of leaping  upon me, when, quick as lightning, the thought struck me, to assist  the officer, in sending the dog with all fury to the forest a  little distance before me. I pointed my finger in that direction,  clapped my hands, and shouted in imitation of the officer. The dog  hastened past me with redoubled speed towards the forest; being  urged by the officer and myself, and both of us running in the same  direction.    Gaining the forest, I soon lost sight of the officer and dog,  and have not seen them since. I took a back course, crossed the  road, took round into the wilderness, on the left, and made the  road again in time to cross a bridge over Vermilion River, where I  was hailed by half a dozen men, who had been anxiously waiting our  arrival to that part of the country, and who urged me very  earnestly to stop and preach. I told them that I could not then do  it, for an officer was on my track. I passed on six miles further,  through mud and rain, and overtook the brethren, and preached the  same evening to a crowded audience, among whom we were well  entertained.    The Book of Mormon, which I dropped at the house of Simeon  Carter, when taken by the officer, was by these circumstances left  with him. He read it with attention. It wrought deeply upon his  mind, and he went fifty miles to the church we had left in  Kirtland, and was there baptized and ordained an Elder. He then  returned to his home and commenced to preach and baptize. A church  of about sixty members was soon organized in the place where I had  played such a trick of deception on the dog.    We now pursued our journey for some days, and at length arrived  in Sandusky, in the western part of Ohio. Here resided a tribe, or  nation of Indians, called Wyandots, on whom we called, and with  whom we spent several days. We were well received, and had an  opportunity of laying before them the record of their forefathers,  which we did. They rejoiced in the tidings, bid us God speed, and  desired us to write to them in relation to our success among the  tribes further west, who had already removed to the Indian  territory, where these expected soon to go.    Taking an affectionate leave of this people, we continued our  journey to Cincinnati. In this city we spent several days, and  preached to many of the people, but without much success. About the  20th of December we took passage on a steamer for St. Louis. In a  few days we arrived at the mouth of the Ohio, and finding the river  blocked with ice, the boat did not proceed further. We therefore  landed and pursued our journey on foot for two hundred miles, to  the neighborhood of St. Louis.    We halted for a few days in Illinois, about twenty miles from  St. Louis, on account of a dreadful storm of rain and snow, which  lasted for a week or more, during which the snow fell in some  places near three feet deep. Although in the midst of strangers, we  were kindly entertained, found many friends, and preached to large  congregations in several neighborhoods.    In the beginning of 1831 we renewed our journey; and, passing  through St. Louis and St. Charles, we travelled on foot for three  hundred miles through vast prairies and through trackless wilds of  snow--no beaten road; houses few and far between; and the bleak  northwest wind always blowing in our faces with a keenness which  would almost take the skin off the face. We travelled for whole  days, from morning till night, without a house or fire, wading in  snow to the knees at every step, and the cold so intense that the  snow did not melt on the south side of the houses, even in the  mid-day sun, for nearly six weeks. We carried on our backs our  changes of clothing, several books, and corn bread and raw pork. We  often ate our frozen bread and pork by the way, when the bread  would be so frozen that we could not bite or penetrate any part of  it but the outside crust.    After much fatigue and some suffering we all arrived in  Independence, in the county of Jackson, on the extreme western  frontiers of Missouri, and of the United States.    This was about fifteen hundred miles from where we started, and  we had performed most of the journey on foot, through a wilderness  country, in the worst season of the year, occupying about four  months, during which we had preached the gospel to tens of  thousands of Gentiles and two nations of Indians; baptizing,  confirming and organizing many hundreds of people into churches of  Latter-day Saints.    This was the first mission performed by the Elders of the Church  in any of the States west of New York, and we were the first  members of the same which were ever on this frontier.
