Stir thoroughly  as each ingredient is added, for the evenness of the dye depends upon  the thorough distribution of the mordants and color in the dye bath.  Generally it is advised to strain the dye before it is added, but, as an  even tone is not the desired result for this special handicraft, I never  follow this suggestion.    [Sidenote: _Coloring depends on temperature_]    \"The proper temperature for introducing the color in the bath is not  over 150 deg. F., but if one has not a bath thermometer, the temperature  must be very hot, yet far below boiling point. Temperature plays a great  part in dyeing, for if the dye bath is too hot when the cloth is  introduced, the dye, having a great avidity for wool, will be absorbed  unequally by the cloth, the ends and outside folds of the cloth  absorbing more color than is desired, and the inner folds will have  less. I am not discussing the process of dyeing as it should be done on  a large scale with vats and suitable reels, etc., but as it is likely to  be done by an amateur, in a small way. When the bath is too hot, the  cloth takes the dye unequally and is quite spotted. A little  irregularity is necessary for a play of color, but it should be secured  in a definite way and only to a certain degree, and not as the result of  accident. If the cloth has come out spotty, it may be redipped, having  added more dye and mordants to the bath, but it will come out a darker  shade. If the bath is anywhere near the boiling point before the cloth  is dipped, reduce it by adding a quart or two of cold water.\"    [Sidenote: _Process of dyeing yarn or raffia_]    [Sidenote: _Clear days are best for dyeing_]    Before dyeing yarn or raffia, bind the skeins loosely in several places  to prevent tangling. \"Having prepared the bath, gather the cloth in the  right hand at half a dozen places along one selvedge, and drop it in,  spreading it at once, using two stout sticks, lifting it up and down  continually so as to expose all parts to the dye. The temperature should  be increased to the boiling point and continued for three-quarters of an  hour. Then lift the cloth up and drain it, then rinse in cold water,  wring dry, but do not press with an iron, as the soft wooly texture is  very desirable. When a quantity of the same color is desired, the same  water can be used again by adding acid and Glauber salts, together with  more dyestuff with each fresh dip of cloth. It must be stated, however,  that the color will not be so clear with succeeding dips, but that does  not matter, as a difference is desired. The process of dyeing is very  delicate, and the utmost precision must be observed in following  proportions and directions regarding temperature, etc. Dyeing is more  successful in clear weather than on rainy days, and soft water is  required to get good results. If water contains much lime or earthy  salts it is unfit for dyeing, and must be neutralized by acetic acid. In  such cases it would be still better to use rain water.    [Sidenote: _Vegetable dyes and chemical dyes compared_]    \"There is a curious conviction prevailing in some quarters that  beautiful durable colors are obtainable only from vegetable dyes. My  first experiments were with barks, mosses, etc., but the difficulty of  getting them, the enormous amount necessary to dye any quantity of  goods, the tedious process in their use, and the fact that after all  only a narrow range of colors is obtainable from them, compelled me to  abandon them altogether. I began to investigate chemical dyes, and to  gain information I applied to one of the largest woolen mills in New  England, one which maintains a high reputation for the class of goods it  manufactures; also to two wholesale houses dealing in all kinds of  dyestuffs; and finally to one of the best experts in color in the  country. Their verdict was unanimous, and is summed up in the opinion of  the expert which he expressed in a letter to me on this question:    \"'In regard to the use of vegetable dyes, I would say that they have  almost disappeared from commerce, certainly for the purpose of dyeing  fabrics.    [Sidenote: _Aniline colors_]    \"'We know, of course, that there are strong prejudices still existing in  the layman's mind in regard to the use of aniline colors, who supposes  that they are not only fugitive, but that the resulting tones are harsh  and unattractive. This, unfortunately, was so twenty-five years ago, and  the impression made then upon the layman's mind has not been changed  during all these years; but I can assure you that all the beautiful silk  goods, tapestries, cloths, and all the colors which we see in fabrics  to-day, are made, without exception, from aniline colors, which are  immeasurably more permanent than are the vegetable dyes used up to, say,  1875.'    [Sidenote: _Formulas to be followed_]    \"In using my range of eight colors I provide myself with large, strong  glass bottles in which I keep my diluted colors. I use a pint measure  for diluting the dyes. In preparing the fluid I put one half or one  quarter of an ounce of dry color, whichever amount the formula calls  for, into the pint measure and mix it thoroughly with a little cold  water. The reason for using cold water is that the dyes are a tar  product, and if mixed with hot water first, they are apt to grow waxy  under the heat and not dissolve readily. Having dissolved them, I fill  up the measure with hot water, stirring all the time. This makes a pint  of liquid which is of uniform strength under all circumstances, and  every formula is based upon this invariable pint measure of water. These  formulas I have tried over and over again. They are made with special  reference to the grade of flannel I have adopted, and doubtless will  vary in results if used on other weights or weaves of wool goods.\"      DYE FORMULAS      NO. 1.

He knows which side of his breadnut is peeled.\"    \"I'm sure you'll do a wonderful job,\" she exclaimed, impulsively giving  a ritual _entrechat_. \"And I wish I could stay and help you, but....\"    \"I know, my dear.\"    \"You do?\" She was puzzled. \"But how did the news get around so quickly?\"    He shrugged. \"The Terrestrial grapevine is almost as efficient as the  Fizbian. Didn't you notice any change in the--ah--atmosphere when you  came in?\"    \"Oh, was that the reason?\" Tarb laughed merrily. \"Somehow it never  occurred to me that they could have heard so soon.\"    \"But the morning editions have been out for hours.\"    The door to the office was flung open. Stet stormed in, bristling with a  most unloverlike rage.    \"Miss Morfatch--\" he waved a crumpled copy of the _Terrestrial Tribune_  at her--\"when I give an order, I expect to be obeyed! Didn't Miss Snow  tell you to report directly to my office the instant you came in?  Although that's a question I don't have to ask; I know Miss Snow, at  least, is someone I can trust.\"    \"I was coming to see you, Stet,\" Tarb said soothingly. \"Right away.\"    \"Oh, you were, were you? And have you seen this?\" Stet fairly threw the  paper at her. Smack in the middle of the front page was a picture of  herself in full flight over the airfield bar. Not a very good picture,  but what could you expect with Terrestrial equipment? When the autofax  came, perhaps she would be done justice.

You don't have an independent  income and this is an expensive planet. Besides, I won't let you stay on  Earth.
