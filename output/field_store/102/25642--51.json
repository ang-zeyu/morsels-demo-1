Leon Gozlan, one of the most esteemed magazinists in France, has  lately paid a flying visit to the scene of his country's most glorious  disasters, Waterloo, and has given a characteristic account of what he  saw and heard there. We quote a part of it, in which he describes a  knavish practice of which great numbers are every year made victims.  M. Gozlan has just passed through the Brussels _faubourg_ Louisa, and  is oppressed with most melancholy reflections, when his coachman  addresses him--         \"Sir,\" exclaimed my conductor, suddenly interrupting my       meditations, \"excuse me if I am troublesome, but before       arriving at Mont-Saint-Jean I wish to warn you of a knavish       trade you have probably never heard of at Paris.\"         \"A knavish trade unknown at Paris?\" I replied,       incredulously; \"that is rather surprising. But come, tell me       what is this new species of industry.\"         \"You can easily suppose,\" pursued my loquacious coachman,       \"that after the battle of Waterloo there remained on the       field a large quantity of cannon-balls, buttons, small brass       eagles, and broken weapons. Well, for the last thirty-four       years, the country people have been carrying on a famous       business in these articles.\"         \"It seems to me, however, my friend,\" I observed, \"that a       sale continued for so long a period, must have left very       little to be disposed of at present.\"         \"True, sir; and this is precisely what I would guard you       against. Those who obtain a subsistence by such means,       purchase the goods new at a manufactory, in shares, and then       bury in different parts of the field, and for a wide space       around, pieces of imperial brass eagles, thousands of metal       buttons, and heaps of iron balls. This crop is allowed to       rest in the earth until summer, for few strangers visit       Waterloo in winter; and when the fine weather arrives, they       dig up their relics, to which a sojourn of eight months in a       damp soil gives an appearance of age, deceiving the keenest       observer, and awakening the admiration of pilgrims.\"         \"But this is a shameful deceit.\"         \"True again, sir; but the country is very poor about here;       and after all, perhaps,\" added the philosophic driver, \"no       great harm is done. This year the harvest of brass eagles       has been very fair.\"         We entered the forest of Soignies by a narrow and naturally       covered alley, the two sides crowned with the most luxuriant       foliage. Poplars, elms, and plane-trees appeared to be       striving which should attain the highest elevation. One       peculiarity I could not avoid remarking in the midst of this       solemn and beautiful abode of nature, and that was the       perfect stillness prevailing around. The air itself seemed       without palpitation, and during a ride of nearly two hours       through this sylvan gallery, not even the note of a bird       broke on the solitude. A forest without feathered songsters       appeared unnatural, and the only possible reason that could       be imagined for such a circumstance might be, that since the       formidable day of Waterloo, they had quitted these shades,       never to return, frightened away by the roar of the cannon       and the dismal noise of war. What melancholy is impressed       upon the beautiful forest of Soignies! I cannot overcome the       idea, that since Providence destined it should become the       mute spectator of the great event in its vicinity, it has       retained the mysterious memory in the folding of its leaves       and the depths of its shades. Destiny designs the theatre       for grand actions. An army of one hundred thousand men       perished there. Such was the irrevocable decree.         \"Do you think,\" I inquired of the coachman, wishing to       change the current of my thoughts, \"there are persons so       unscrupulous as to speculate on the curiosity of tourists to       Waterloo in the manner you have described?\"         \"Ah, sir,\" he replied, \"I have not told you half the tricks       they practice on the credulous. It would indeed fatigue you       if I mentioned all of them, but if you will permit me, I       will relate an instance I witnessed myself one day. I was       conducting from Waterloo to Brussels a French artist and a       Prussian tourist. The Prussian supported on his knee some       object very carefully enveloped in a handkerchief, and which       he seemed to value greatly. When we had arrived about midway       on the road, he inquired of the Frenchman whether he had       brought away with him any souvenir of his pilgrimage to       Waterloo.         \"'In good faith no,' replied the other; and yet I was on the       point of making a certain acquisition, but the exorbitant       price demanded prevented me: one hundred francs, besides the       trouble of carrying off such an article.'         \"'What could it have been?' demanded the Prussian,       curiously.         \"'You must not feel offended if I tell you,' returned the       artist; 'it was the skull of a Prussian colonel, a       magnificent one! And what rendered it more valuable, it was       pierced by three holes, made by the balls of Waterloo. One       was in the forehead, the others were through the temples. I       should have had no objection to secure this, if I could have       afforded it, and have had a lamp made of the skull of a       Prussian officer killed by the French. And you, sir?' he       continued, looking at the packet carried by his       fellow-traveller, 'pray what luck have you had?'         \"'I,' replied the Prussian, with an uneasy movement, and       looking greatly confused, 'I am astonished at the wonderful       resemblance of what has happened to both of us, for I       purchased this morning the skull of a French colonel killed       by a Prussian at Waterloo.'         \"'You, sir?'         \"'Y--e--s,' stammered the Prussian, 'and I thought of having       it made into a cup to drink the health of Blucher at each       anniversary of our victory.'         \"'And is the skull pierced by three bullets?' demanded the       Frenchman, his suspicions becoming awakened.         \"With a look of consternation the Prussian hastily unrolled       the handkerchief, and examined the contents. The skull bore       the same marks indicated by his travelling companion! It was       the identical relic that was French when offered to an       Englishman or Prussian, and had become Prussian or English       when offered to a Frenchman.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#9)"],[1,"disease when its ravages were infinitely greater.    To resume, then: these inquiries (which we undertook without  anticipating so rich a harvest) have proved, and made evident--    That the contagious typhus afflicting horned cattle, has spread its  destructive principle over our globe ever since there have been animals  living on its surface.    That from century to century, not to say from year to year, it has  carried its terrors amidst nations and peoples.    That the remedial measures which had been taken and applied prior to the  middle of the eighteenth century, were utterly powerless either to cure  this disease or to prevent it.    That at that period appeared two English physicians, men of remarkable  aptitude and penetration, one of whom, Malcolm Flemming, laid down in  theory the bases of a preventive treatment; whilst the other, Peter  Layard, applied this theory to practice, by inoculating sound and  healthy animals with the morbid virus of the typhus, in order to protect  them from the fatal effects of the contagion.    That this all-important progress in medical experience, has been  absolutely forgotten; so much so, indeed, that the experiments of  inoculation, tried in Russia only ten or twelve years ago with perfect  success, do not seem to be connected by any link with those made in  England a century before, and that the invasion of the so-called  CATTLE PLAGUE in 1865 seemed to some men to have introduced a  new scourge, which men were not armed and prepared to meet--which they  were powerless to cure, or to stay in its progress.    These inquiries, then, have proved, we think, that we are not so  helpless as we had imagined to resist the evil. But we cannot help  feeling, that we have laid bare in this exposition some most distressing  inferences concerning the human mind. For, in truth, can anything be  more deplorable, than thus to see the civilized nations of Europe  endure, from century to century, these reiterated outbreaks of cattle  typhus, and to see likewise that no man of sufficient energy and  independence has yet arisen to tell the truth fearlessly to the  governments and peoples, however painful that truth may be, and to  expose the futility of the measures hitherto employed to arrest the  scourge?    And, on the other hand, is it not most afflicting to see discoveries of  indisputable value buried out of view, submerged in public libraries,  utterly unknown and forgotten, like their authors, to such a degree,  that the distemper which they have made known in its entirety, and which  is as old as the world itself, seems to us almost new in 1865?    God send, that these cruel trials and severe lessons which the past has  bequeathed to us may teach us something for our benefit! May the  irresistible might which is derived from the auspicious union of capital  and intelligence supersede the vain and flimsy efforts of isolated  energy! May the government, which lavishes hundreds of millions upon the  destructive engines of war, devote some portion of its ample means to  the study of hereditary infections and contagious diseases! For these  fatal epidemics decimate men as well as cattle, and we may at least ward  off from our children the desolating disease which at present afflicts  ourselves.    We possess already every requisite means to protect ourselves from the  formidable visitation of these diseases: we have science; we have the  men who cultivate and teach it; we have the experience of the past  added to our own. To-day, we are called upon to resist the baleful  effects of cattle typhus; but another epizootia may come to-morrow, and  strike our horses and our sheep--those domestic animals which constitute  our most precious possession. The cholera hovers about us. If we do  nothing, if we talk and debate instead of acting, these scourges will  come upon us on a sudden, and find us quite as helpless as ever to  resist their sway.    These palpable truths deserve to be further developed, and will be  treated more copiously at the end of this book. They will constitute the  complement of our work, necessarily written in haste, since the danger  we had to expose was itself so urgent and alarming.    FOOTNOTES:    [A] To assist the researches of other inquirers on this vital subject,  now so generally interesting, we may add, that the cattle treatises  already referred to--of Malcolm Flemming and Peter Layard--are to be  found in the Library of the British Museum, bound together in a single  volume, which is certainly worth ten times its weight in gold. It  contains, indeed, eight different opuscula, all relating to cattle  complaints, which scientific students may consult with real  gratification. I will here transcribe the titles of the most important  of these treatises, the pregnant expositions of the two English  physicians above-named.    That of Malcolm Flemming:    \"A Proposal, in order to Diminish the Progress of the Distemper among  the Horned Cattle, supported by Facts. London, 1755.\"    That of Peter Layard:    \"An Essay on the Nature, Cause, and Cure of the Contagious Distemper  among the Horned Cattle in these Kingdoms. London, 1757.\"    A great many accounts, treatises, and expositions on the same subject  appeared at the same time in France, Holland, Denmark, and Switzerland.  One, which appeared in the last of these countries, is entitled:    \"Reflexions sur la Maladie du Gros Betail, par la Societe des Medecius  de Geneve. 1756.\"          SECOND PART.    This Part is divided, as already stated, into four chapters.          CHAPTER I.    _On Typhous Diseases in general, and the Typhus which affects the Ox in  particular._      By following the example of those authors who have described the  contagious typhus of the ox, we might proceed at once to explain its  symptoms, and go directly to our purpose; but, by taking this hasty  course, we should expose ourselves to be imperfectly understood by the  majority of our readers, and to leave certain doubts in the minds of  physicians as to the nature of the disease and the propriety of its  treatment.    All animals, including man himself, are born with a predisposition and  liability to contract a certain number of contagious febrile diseases;  they bear in a manner a certain number of physiological elements, which  might be called latent germs, and which, under given conditions, become  the leaven of these diseases. This must, indeed, be the case, since  after these disorders have been once developed those who have been cured  of them are not apt to contract them again, the morbid developments  having destroyed that natural aptitude which had previously existed to  undergo the morbid action of the contagious virus. These diseases are  not numerous; they constitute a very distinct class, and the same laws,  which regulate the phenomena in one of them are applicable to all the  rest.    These diseases exhibit the following characteristics: 1st, a period of  incubation, during which the whole economy, more particularly the blood  and humours, experience very important changes and modifications; 2nd, a  febrile state, which varies in its continuous or intermittent types, and  in its intensity, according to the species of the animals, and which  proceeds from the alteration of the blood; 3rd, a revulsion at once  toxical and congestive towards the nervous centre, inducing _stupor_;  4th, a flux of mucus from the mouth and chest; 5th, a more intense,  congestive, and inflammatory flux or discharge from the external or  internal teguments--the skin or the mucous membrane of the digestive  channels; 6th, a period of adynamia and dejection, with a tendency, in  some cases, to a critical or salutary rejection of the morbid matter by  the development of tumours or abscesses in the skin; 7th, they are at  once infectious and contagious, epizootic or epidemic; that is to say,  they are transmitted in different degrees by contact, by inoculation,  and at a distance by the means of vitiated air; 8th, finally--and this  is their leading characteristic--_they are not subject to recurrence_,  each individual that has once been affected, losing in general all  aptitude to contract the disease a second time.    This last characteristic, when well understood, ought in reason to  induce us to have recourse to the preventive treatment, and such has  been the case with respect to the most virulent amongst them--small-pox  and the typhus of the ox.    Prompted by these principles, which are as logical and fixed as any  mathematical deduction, I suggested in 1855 that inoculation should be  applied in typhoid fever, which is nothing else but the equivalent of  intestinal small-pox, in order to prevent the disease in men. But if the  simplest truth sometimes requires a contest of ages before it is heard  and understood, I could not hope to fix attention on a fact which might  be taken as problematical. I felt that I was outrunning time, and that I  should neither be heard nor understood; and so it has proved.    Be that as it may, these typhous diseases have, as is seen, their laws  and foreseen development. They attack animals generally, but chiefly  herbivorous animals, endowed, as we have shown in the first part, with a  vital resistance which is, relatively speaking, very inconsiderable.    These febrile typhous diseases (whether their development is caused by a  spontaneous morbid action in the patient or by an evident contagion),  have a period of incubation during which the vital strength undergoes  latent morbid modifications, though not sufficient to indicate, save in  times of epizootics and epidemics, the particular form which is about to  reveal its symptoms in the course of a few days. This period of  incubation being over, the mouth and chest become affected, and fever  declares itself; and then the _materies morbi_, which is to become the  special and dominant characteristic of the distemper, is directed either  to"]]]
