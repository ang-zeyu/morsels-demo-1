For each state Lincoln appointed  a military governor: for Tennessee, Andrew Johnson; for Arkansas, John  S. Phelps; for Louisiana, General Shepley. In Virginia he recognized the  \"reorganized\" government, which had been transferred to Alexandria  when the new State of West Virginia was formed. The military governors  undertook the slow and difficult work of reorganization, however,  with but slight success owing to the small numbers of Unionists and of  Confederates who would take the oath. But by 1864, \"ten percent\" state  governments were established in Arkansas and Louisiana, and progress was  being made in Tennessee.    Congress was impatient of Lincoln's claim to executive precedence in the  matter of reconstruction, and in 1864, both Houses passed the  Wade-Davis Bill, a plan which asserted the right of Congress to control  reconstruction and foreshadowed a radical settlement of the question.  Lincoln disposed of the bill by a pocket veto and, in a proclamation  dated July 8, 1864, stated that he was unprepared \"to be inflexibly  committed to any single plan of restoration,\" or to discourage loyal  citizens by setting aside the governments already established in  Louisiana and Arkansas, or to recognize the authority of Congress to  abolish slavery. He was ready, however, to cooperate with the people  of any State who wished to accept the plan prepared by Congress and  he hoped that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery would be  adopted.    Lincoln early came to the conclusion that slavery must be destroyed, and  he had urgently advocated deportation of the freedmen, for he believed  that the two races could not live in harmony after emancipation.  The nearest he came to recommending the vote for the Negro was in a  communication to Governor Hahn of Louisiana in March 1864: \"I barely  suggest, for your private consideration, whether some of the colored  people may not be let in, as for instance, the very intelligent, and  especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They would  probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the jewel of liberty  within the family of freedom. But this is only a suggestion, not to the  public, but to you alone.\"    Throughout the war President Lincoln assumed that the state  organizations in the South were illegal because disloyal and that new  governments must be established. But just at the close of the war,  probably carried away by feeling, he all but recognized the Virginia  Confederate Government as competent to bring the state back into the  Union. While in Richmond on April 5, 1865, he gave to Judge Campbell a  statement of terms: the national authority to be restored; no recession  on slavery by the executive; hostile forces to disband. The next day he  notified General Weitzel, in command at Richmond, that he might permit  the Virginia Legislature to meet and withdraw military and other support  from the Confederacy. But these measures met strong opposition in  Washington, especially from Secretary Stanton and Senator Wade and other  congressional leaders, and on the 11th of April, Lincoln withdrew his  permission for the legislature to meet. \"I cannot go forward,\" he said,  \"with everybody opposed to me.\" It was on the same day that he made his  last public speech, and Sumner, who was strongly opposed to his policy,  remarked that \"the President's speech and other things augur confusion  and uncertainty in the future, with hot contumacy.\" At a cabinet meeting  on the 14th of April, Lincoln made his last statement on the subject.  It was fortunate, he said, that Congress had adjourned, for \"we shall  reanimate the States\" before Congress meets; there should be no killing,  no persecutions; there was too much disposition to treat the Southern  people \"not as fellow citizens.\"    The possibility of a conciliatory restoration ended when Lincoln was  assassinated. Moderate, firm, tactful, of great personal influence, not  a doctrinaire, and not a Southerner like Johnson, Lincoln might have  \"prosecuted peace\" successfully. His policy was very unlike that  proposed by the radical leaders. They would base the new governments  upon the loyalty of the past plus the aid of enfranchised slaves; he  would establish the new regime upon the loyalty of the future. Like  Governor Andrew he thought that restoration must be effected by the  willing efforts of the South. He would aid and guide but not force the  people. If the latter did not wish restoration, they might remain under  military rule. There should be no forced Negro suffrage, no sweeping  disfranchisement of whites, no \"carpetbaggism.\"    The work of President Johnson demands for its proper understanding some  consideration of the condition of the political parties at the close of  the war, for politics had much to do with reconstruction. The Democratic  party, divided and defeated in the election of 1860, lost its Southern  members in 1861 by the secession and remained a minority party during  the remainder of the war. It retained its organization, however, and  in 1864 polled a large vote. Discredited by its policy of opposition to  Lincoln's administration, its ablest leaders joined the Republicans  in support of the war. Until 1869, the party was poorly represented  in Congress although, as soon as hostilities ended, the War Democrats  showed a tendency to return to the old party. As to reconstruction, the  party stood on the Crittenden-Johnson resolutions of 1861, though most  Democrats were now willing to have slavery abolished.    The Republican party--frankly sectional and going into power on the  single issue of opposition to the extension of slavery--was forced by  the secession movement to take up the task of preserving the Union by  war. Consequently, the party developed new principles, welcomed the aid  of the War Democrats, and found it advisable to drop its name and  with its allies to form the Union or National Union party. It was  this National Union party which in 1864 nominated Abraham Lincoln,  a Republican, and Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, on the same ticket.  Lincoln's second Cabinet was composed of both Republicans and War  Democrats. When the war ended, the conservative leaders were anxious  to hold the Union party together in order to be in a better position  to settle the problems of reconstruction, but the movement of the War  Democrats back to their old party tended to leave in the Union party  only its Republican members, with the radical leaders dominating.    In the South the pressure of war so united the people that party  divisions disappeared for a time, but the causes of division continued  to exist, and two parties, at least, would have developed had the  pressure been removed. Though all factions supported the war after it  began, the former Whigs and Douglas Democrats, when it was over, liked  to remember that they had been \"Union\" men in 1860 and expected to  organize in opposition to the extreme Democrats, who were now charged  with being responsible for the misfortunes of the South. They were in  a position to affiliate with the National Union party of the North if  proper inducements were offered, while the regular Democrats were ready  to rejoin their old party. But the embittered feelings resulting from  the murder of Lincoln and the rapid development of the struggle between  President Johnson and Congress caused the radicals \"to lump the old  Union Democrats and Whigs together with the secessionists--and many were  driven where they did not want to go, into temporary affiliation with  the Democratic party.\" Thousands went very reluctantly; the old Whigs,  indeed, were not firmly committed to the Democrats until radical  reconstruction had actually begun. Still other \"loyalists\" in the  South were prepared to join the Northern radicals in advocating the  disfranchisement of Confederates and in opposing the granting of  suffrage to the Negroes.    The man upon whom fell the task of leading these opposing factions,  radical and conservative, along a definite line of action looking to  reunion had few qualifications for the task. Johnson was ill-educated,  narrow, and vindictive and was positive that those who did not agree  with him were dishonest. Himself a Southerner, picked up by the National  Union Convention of 1864, as Thaddeus Stevens said, from \"one of those  damned rebel provinces,\" he loved the Union, worshiped the Constitution,  and held to the strict construction views of the State Rights Democrats.  Rising from humble beginnings, he was animated by the most intense  dislike of the \"slavocracy,\" as he called the political aristocracy of  the South. Like many other American leaders he was proud of his humble  origin, but unlike many others he never sloughed off his backwoods  crudeness. He continually boasted of himself and vilified the  aristocrats, who in return treated him badly. His dislike of them was  so marked that Isham G. Harris, a rival politician, remarked that \"if  Johnson were a snake, he would lie in the grass to bite the heels of  rich men's children.\" His primitive notions of punishment were evident  in 1865 when he advocated imprisonment, execution, and confiscation; but  like other reckless talkers he often said more than he meant.    When Johnson succeeded to the presidency, the feeling was nearly  universal among the radicals, according to Julian, that he would prove  a godsend to the country, for \"aside from Mr. Lincoln's known policy of  tenderness to the rebels, which now so jarred upon the feelings of the  hour, his well known views on the subject of reconstruction were as  distasteful as possible to radical Republicans.\" Senator Wade declared  to the President: \"Johnson, we have faith in you. By the gods, there  will be no trouble "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#9)"],[1,"and last, not far from seven hundred  English folk had come to live in Virginia. And these skeletons eating  snakes and adders were all that remained of that company; all those  others had died miserably and their hopes were ashes with them.    What might Sir Thomas Gates, the Governor, do? \"That which added most to  his sorowe, and not a little startled him, was the impossibilitie.. how  to amend one whitt of this. His forces were not of habilitie to revenge  upon the Indian, nor his owne supply (now brought from the Bermudas)  sufficient to relieve his people.\" So he called a Council and listened  in turn to Sir George Somers, to Christopher Newport, and to \"the  gentlemen and Counsaile of the former Government.\" The end and upshot  was that none could see other course than to abandon the country.  England-in-America had tried and failed, and had tried again and failed.  God, or the course of Nature, or the current of History was against her.  Perhaps in time stronger forces and other attempts might yet issue from  England. But now the hour had come to say farewell!    Upon the bosom of the river swung two pinnaces, the Discovery and the  Virginia, left by the departing ships months before, and the Deliverance  and the Patience, the Bermuda pinnaces. Thus the English abandoned the  little town that was but three years old. Aboard the four small ships  they went, and down the broad river, between the flowery shores, they  sailed away. Doubtless under the trees on either hand were Indians  watching this retreat of the invaders of their forests. The plan of the  departing colonists was to turn north, when they had reached the sea,  and make for Newfoundland, where they might perhaps meet with English  fishing ships. So they sailed down the river, and doubtless many  hearts were heavy and sad, but others doubtless were full of joy and  thankfulness to be going back to an older home than Virginia.    The river broadened toward Chesapeake--and then, before them, what did  they see? What deliverance for those who had held on to the uttermost?  They saw the long boat of an English ship coming toward them with  flashing oars, bringing news of comfort and relief. There, indeed, off  Point Comfort lay three ships, the De La Warr, the Blessing, and the  Hercules, and they brought, with a good company and good stores, Sir  Thomas West, Lord De La Warr, appointed, over Gates, Lord Governor and  Captain General, by land and sea, of the Colony of Virginia.    The Discovery, the Virginia, the Patience, and the Deliverance thereupon  put back to that shore they thought to have left forever. Two days  later, on Sunday the 10th of June, 1610, there anchored before Jamestown  the De La Warr, the Blessing, and the Hercules; and it was thus that the  new Lord Governor wrote home: \"I... in the afternoon went ashore, where  after a sermon made by Mr. Buck... I caused my commission to be read,  upon which Sir Thomas Gates delivered up...unto me his owne commission,  both patents, and the counsell seale; and then I delivered some few  wordes unto the Company.... and after... did constitute and give place  of office and chardge to divers Captaines and gentlemen and elected unto  me a counsaile.\"         The dead was alive again. Saith Rich's ballad:         And to the adventurers* thus he writes,          \"Be not dismayed at all,       For scandall cannot doe us wrong,          God will not let us fall.       Let England knowe our willingnesse,          For that our worke is good,       WE HOPE TO PLANT A NATION          WHERE NONE BEFORE HATH STOOD.\"              * The Virginia Company.        CHAPTER VI. SIR THOMAS DALE    In a rebuilded Jamestown, Lord De La Warr, of \"approved courage, temper  and experience,\" held for a short interval dignified, seigneurial sway,  while his restless associates adventured far and wide. Sir George Somers  sailed back to the Bermudas to gather a cargo of the wild swine of those  woods, but illness seized him there, and he died among the beautiful  islands. That Captain Samuel Argall who had traversed for the Company  the short road from the Canaries took up Smith's fallen mantle and  carried on the work of exploration. It was he who found, and named for  the Lord Governor, Delaware Bay. He went up the Potomac and traded for  corn; rescued an English boy from the Indians; had brushes with the  savages. In the autumn back to England with a string of ships went that  tried and tested seafarer Christopher Newport. Virginia wanted many  things, and chiefly that the Virginia Company should excuse defect and  remember promise. So Gates sailed with Newport to make true report and  guide exertion. Six months passed, and the Lord Governor himself fell  ill and must home to England. So away he, too, went and for seven years  until his death ruled from that distance through a deputy governor. De  La Warr was a man of note and worth, old privy councilor of Elizabeth  and of James, soldier in the Low Countries, strong Protestant and  believer in England-in-America. Today his name is borne by a great  river, a great bay, and by one of the United States.    In London, the Virginia Company, having listened to Gates, projected  a fourth supply for the colony. Of those hundreds who had perished in  Virginia, many had been true and intelligent men, and again many perhaps  had been hardly that. But the Virginia Company was now determined to  exercise for the future a discrimination. It issued a broadside,  making known that it was sending a new supply of men and all necessary  provision in a fleet of good ships, under the conduct of Sir Thomas  Gates and Sir Thomas Dale, and that it was not intended any more to  burden the action with \"vagrant and unnecessary persons... but honest  and industrious men, as Carpenters, Smiths, Coopers, Fishermen, Tanners,  Shoemakers, Shipwrights, Brickmen, Gardeners, Husbandmen, and laboring  men of all sorts that... shall be entertained for the Voyage upon such  termes as their qualitie and fitnesse shall deserve.\" Yet, in spite of  precautions, some of the other sort continued to creep in with the sober  and industrious. Master William Crashaw, in a sermon upon the Virginia  venture, remarks that \"they who goe... be like for aught I see to those  who are left behind, even of all sorts better and worse!\" This probably  hits the mark.    The Virginia Company meant at last to have order in Virginia. To this  effect, a new office was created and a strong man was found to fill it.  Gates remained De La Warr's deputy governor, but Sir Thomas Dale went  as Marshal of Virginia. The latter sailed in March, 1611, with \"three  ships, three hundred people, twelve kine, twenty goats, and all things  needful for the colony.\" Gates followed in May with other ships, three  hundred colonists, and much cattle.    For the next few years Dale becomes, in effect, ruler of Virginia. He  did much for the colony, and therefore, in that far past that is not  so distant either, much for the United States--a man of note, and worth  considering.    Dale had seen many years of service in the Low Countries. He was still  in Holland when the summons came to cross the ocean in the service of  the Virginia Company. On the recommendation of Henry, Prince of Wales,  the States-General of the United Netherlands consented \"that Captain  Thomas Dale (destined by the King of Great Britain to be employed in  Virginia in his Majesty's service) may absent himself from his company  for the space of three years, and that his said company shall remain  meanwhile vacant, to be resumed by him if he think proper.\"    This man had a soldier's way with him and an iron will. For five years  in Virginia he exhibited a certain stern efficiency which was perhaps  the best support and medicine that could have been devised. At the end  of that time, leaving Virginia, he did not return to the Dutch service,  but became Admiral of the fleet of the English East India Company, thus  passing from one huge historic mercantile company to another. With six  ships he sailed for India. Near Java, the English and the Dutch having  chosen to quarrel, he had with a Dutch fleet \"a cruel, bloody fight.\"  Later, when peace was restored, the East India Company would have given  him command of an allied fleet of English and Dutch ships, the objective  being trade along the coast of Malabar and an attempt to open commerce  with the Chinese. But Sir Thomas Dale was opening commerce with a  vaster, hidden land, for at Masulipatam he died. \"Whose valor,\" says his  epitaph, \"having shined in the Westerne, was set in the Easterne India.\"    But now in Maytime of 1611 Dale was in Virginian waters. By this day,  beside the main settlement of Jamestown, there were at Cape Henry and  Point Comfort small forts garrisoned with meager companies of men. Dale  made pause at these, setting matters in order, and then, proceeding up  the river, he came to Jamestown and found the people gathered to receive  him. Presently he writes home to the Company a letter that gives a view  of the place and its needs. Any number of things must be done, requiring  continuous and hard work, \"as, namely, the reparation of the falling  Church and so of the Store-house, a stable for our horses, a munition  house, a Powder house, a new well for the amending of the most  unwholesome water which the old afforded. Brick to be made, a sturgion  house... a Block house to be raised on the North side of our back river  to prevent the Indians from killing our cattle, a house to be set up to  lodge our cattle in the winter, and hay to be appointed in his due time  to be made, a smith's forge to be perfected, caske for our Sturgions  to be made, and besides private gardens for each man common gardens  for hemp and flax and such other seeds, and lastly a bridge to land our  goods dry and safe upon, for most of which I take present order.\"    Dale would have agreed with Dr. Watts that         Satan"]]]
