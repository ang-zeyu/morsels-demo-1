Them he instructed in the fear of God, and many of  them received direct ministrations. Of Adam's descendants, Seth, Enos,  Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech the father of  Noah, each representing a distinct generation, were all living during  Adam's lifetime. Noah was born but a hundred and twenty-six years  after the time of Adam's death, and moreover lived nearly six hundred  years with his father Lamech, by whom he was doubtless instructed in  the traditions concerning God's personal manifestations, which Lamech  had learned from the lips of Adam. Through the medium of Noah and his  family, a knowledge of God by direct tradition was carried beyond the  flood; and Noah held direct communication with God,[54] and lived to  instruct ten generations of his descendants. Then followed Abraham,  who also enjoyed direct communion with the Creator,[55] and after him  Isaac, and Jacob or Israel, among whose descendants the Lord wrought  such wonders through the instrumentality of Moses. Thus, had there  been no written records, tradition would have preserved and  transmitted a knowledge of God.      [52] Genesis iv, 9-16; Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 22, 34-40.      [53] Genesis iv, 16; Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 41.      [54] Genesis vi, 13, and succeeding chapter.      [55] Genesis xii, and succeeding chapters.    =6.= But even if the accounts of the earliest of man's personal  communion with God had become dimmed with time, and therefore weakened  in effect, they could but give place to other traditions founded on  later manifestations of the Divine personality. Unto Moses the Lord  made Himself known, not alone from behind the curtain of fire and the  screen of clouds,[56] but by direct face to face communication,  whereby the chosen high-priest beheld even \"the similitude\" of his  God.[57] This account of direct communion between Moses and God, in  part of which the people were permitted to share,[58] as far as their  faith and purity permitted, has been preserved by Israel through all  the generations of the past. And from Israel the traditions of God's  existence have spread throughout the world; so that we find traces of  this ancient knowledge even in the most fanciful and perverted  mythologies of heathen nations.      [56] Exo. iii, 4; xix, 18; Numb. xii, 5.      [57] Numb. xii, 8; see also Pearl of Great Price, Moses i, 1-2.      [58] Exo. xix, 9, 11, 17-20.    =7. II. Human Reason=, operating upon observations of the things of  nature, strongly declares the existence of God. The mind, already  imbued with the historical truths of the Divine existence and its  close relationship with man, will find confirmatory evidence in nature  on every side; and even to him who rejects the testimony of the past,  and assumes to set up his own judgment as superior to the common  belief of ages, the multifarious evidences of design in nature appeal.  Every observer must be impressed by the proofs of order and system  among created things, and by the absence of superfluities in nature.  He notes the regular succession of day and night providing alternate  periods of work and rest for man, animals, and vegetables; the  sequence of the seasons, each with its longer periods of labor and  recuperation, the mutual dependence of animals and plants, the  circulation of water from sea to cloud, from cloud to earth again,  sustaining the fertility of the soil. As man proceeds to the closer  examination of things, he finds that by study and scientific  investigation these proofs are multiplied many fold. He may learn of  the laws by which earth and its associated worlds are governed in  their orbits; by which satellites are held subordinate to planets, and  planets to suns; he may behold the marvels of vegetable and animal  anatomy, and the surpassing mechanism of his own body; and with such  appeals to his reason increasing at every step, his wonder as to who  made all this gives place to inexpressible admiration for the Creator  whose presence and power are thus so forcibly proclaimed; and the  observer becomes a worshiper.    =8.= Everywhere in nature is the evidence of cause and effect; on  every side is the demonstration of means adapted to end. But such  adaptations, says a thoughtful writer, \"indicate contrivance for a  given purpose, and contrivance is the evidence of intelligence, and  intelligence is the attribute of mind, and the intelligent mind that  built the stupendous universe is God.\"[59] To admit the existence of  a designer in the evidence of design, to say there must be a contriver  in a world of intelligent contrivance, to believe in an adapter when  man's life is directly dependent upon the most perfect adaptations  conceivable, is but to accept self-evident truths. These axioms of  nature ought to require no demonstration; the burden of proof as to  the non-existence of a God ought to be placed upon him who questions  the solemn truth. \"Every house is builded by some man, but he that  built all things is God.\" So spake the Apostle of old,[60] and plain  as is the truth expressed in these simple words, there are among men a  few who profess to doubt the evidence of reason, and who deny the  Author of their own being. Strange, is it not, that here and there  one, who finds in the contrivance exhibited by the ant in building her  house, in the architecture of the honey-comb, and in the myriad  instances of orderly instinct among the least of living things, a  proof of intelligence from which man may learn and be wise, will yet  question the operation of intelligence in the creation of worlds and  in the constitution of the universe?[61]      [59] Cassell's Bible Dictionary, p. 481.      [60] Paul in Heb. iii, 4.      [61] See Note 4.    =9.= Man's inborn consciousness tells him of his own existence; his  ordinary powers of observation prove the existence of others of his  kind, and of uncounted orders of organized beings; from this he  concludes that something must have existed always, for had there been  a time of no existence, a period of nothingness, existence could never  have begun, for from nothing, nothing can be derived. The eternal  existence of something, then, is a fact beyond dispute; and the  question requiring answer is, what is that eternal something--that  existence which is without beginning and without end? The skeptic may  answer, \"Nature; matter has always existed, and the universe is but a  manifestation of matter organized by forces operating upon it;  however, Nature is not God.\" But matter is neither vital nor active,  nor is force intelligent; yet vitality and ceaseless activity are  characteristic of created things, and the effects of intelligence are  universally present. True, nature is not God; and to mistake the one  for the other is to call the edifice the architect, the fabric the  designer, the marble the sculptor, and the thing the power that made  it. The system of nature is the manifestation of that order which  argues a directing intelligence; and that intelligence is of an  eternal character, coeval with existence itself. Nature herself is a  declaration of a superior Being, whose will and purpose she portrays  in all her varied aspects. Beyond and above nature, stands nature's  God.    =10.= While existence is eternal, and therefore to being there never  was a beginning, never shall be an end, in a relative sense each stage  of organization must have had a beginning, and to every phase of  existence as manifested in each of the countless orders and classes of  created things, there was a first, as there will be a last; though  every ending or consummation in nature is but the beginning of another  stage of advancement. Thus, man's ingenuity has invented theories to  illustrate, if not to explain, a possible sequence of events by which  the earth has been brought from a state of chaos to its present  habitable condition; but by those hypotheses, this globe was once a  barren ball, on which none of the innumerable forms of life that now  tenant it could have existed. The theorist therefore must admit a  beginning to earthly life, and such a beginning is explicable only on  the assumption of some creative act, or a contribution from outside  the earth. If he admit the introduction of life upon the earth from  some other and older sphere, he does but extend the limits of his  inquiry as to the beginning of vital existence; for to explain the  origin of a rose-bush in our own garden by saying that it was  transplanted as an offshoot from a rose-tree growing elsewhere, is no  answer to the question concerning the origin of roses. Science of  necessity assumes a beginning to vital phenomena on this planet, and  admits a finite duration of the earth in its current course of  progressive change; and in this respect, the earth is a representative  of the heavenly bodies in general. The eternity of existence, then, is  no more positive as an indication of an eternal Ruler than is the  endless sequence of change, each stage of which has both beginning and  end. The origination of created things, the beginning of an organized  universe, is utterly inexplicable on any assumption of spontaneous  change in matter, or of fortuitous and accidental operation of its  properties.    =11.= Human reason, so liable to err in dealing with subjects of  lesser import even, may not of itself lead its possessor to a full  knowledge of God; yet its exercise will aid him in his search,  strengthening and confirming his inherited instinct toward his  Maker.[62] \"The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\"[63] In  the scriptures, the word fool[64] is used to designate a wicked man,  one who has forfeited his wisdom by a long course of wrongdoing,  bringing darkness over his mind in place of light, and ignorance  instead of knowledge. By such a course, the mind becomes depraved and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#9)"],[1,"into his  suspicious eyes. Tears sparkled like jewels on her long dark lashes.    'I am only a girl of the king's seraglio,' she said, with a certain  proud humility. 'He has never glanced at me, and probably never will. I  am less than one of the dogs that gnaw the bones in his banquet hall.    'But I am no painted toy; I am of flesh and blood. I breathe, hate,  fear, rejoice and love. And I have loved you, King Conan, ever since I  saw you riding at the head of your knights along the streets of Belverus  when you visited King Nimed, years ago. My heart tugged at its strings  to leap from my bosom and fall in the dust of the street under your  horse's hoofs.'    Color flooded her countenance as she spoke, but her dark eyes did not  waver. Conan did not at once reply; wild and passionate and untamed he  was, yet any but the most brutish of men must be touched with a certain  awe or wonder at the baring of a woman's naked soul.    She bent her head then, and pressed her red lips to the fingers that  imprisoned her slim wrist. Then she flung up her head as if in sudden  recollection of their position, and terror flared in her dark eyes.    'Haste!' she whispered urgently. 'It is past midnight. You must be  gone.'    'But won't they skin you alive for stealing these keys?'    'They'll never know. If the black men remember in the morning who gave  them the wine, they will not dare admit the keys were stolen from them  while they were drunk. The key that I could not obtain is the one that  unlocks this door. You must make your way to freedom through the pits.  What awful perils lurk beyond that door I cannot even guess. But greater  danger lurks for you if you remain in this cell.    'King Tarascus has returned--'    'What? Tarascus?'    'Aye! He has returned, in great secrecy, and not long ago he descended  into the pits and then came out again, pale and shaking, like a man who  had dared a great hazard. I heard him whisper to his squire, Arideus,  that despite Xaltotun you should die.'    'What of Xaltotun?' murmured Conan.    He felt her shudder.    'Do not speak of him!' she whispered. 'Demons are often summoned by the  sound of their names. The slaves say that he lies in his chamber, behind  a bolted door, dreaming the dreams of the black lotus. I believe that  even Tarascus secretly fears him, or he would slay you openly. But he  has been in the pits tonight, and what he did there, only Mitra knows.'    'I wonder if that could have been Tarascus who fumbled at my cell door  awhile ago?' muttered Conan.    'Here is a dagger!' she whispered, pressing something through the bars.  His eager fingers closed on an object familiar to their touch. 'Go  quickly through yonder door, turn to the left and make your way along  the cells until you come to a stone stair. On your life do not stray  from the line of the cells! Climb the stair and open the door at the  top; one of the keys will fit it. If it be the will of Mitra, I will  await you there.' Then she was gone, with a patter of light slippered  feet.    Conan shrugged his shoulders, and turned toward the farther grille. This  might be some diabolical trap planned by Tarascus, but plunging headlong  into a snare was less abhorrent to Conan's temperament than sitting  meekly to await his doom. He inspected the weapon the girl had given  him, and smiled grimly. Whatever else she might be, she was proven by  that dagger to be a person of practical intelligence. It was no slender  stiletto, selected because of a jeweled hilt or gold guard, fitted only  for dainty murder in milady's boudoir; it was a forthright poniard, a  warrior's weapon, broad-bladed, fifteen inches in length, tapering to a  diamond-sharp point.    He grunted with satisfaction. The feel of the hilt cheered him and gave  him a glow of confidence. Whatever webs of conspiracy were drawn about  him, whatever trickery and treachery ensnared him, this knife was real.  The great muscles of his right arm swelled in anticipation of murderous  blows.    He tried the farther door, fumbling with the keys as he did so. It was  not locked. Yet he remembered the black man locking it. That furtive,  bent figure, then, had been no jailer seeing that the bolts were in  place. He had unlocked the door, instead. There was a sinister  suggestion about that unlocked door. But Conan did not hesitate. He  pushed upon the grille and stepped from the dungeon into the outer  darkness.    As he had thought, the door did not open into another corridor. The  flagged floor stretched away under his feet, and the line of cells ran  away to the right and left behind him, but he could not make out the  other limits of the place into which he had come. He could see neither  the roof nor any other wall. The moonlight filtered into that vastness  only through the grilles of the cells, and was almost lost in the  darkness. Less keen eyes than his could scarcely have discerned the dim  gray patches that floated before each cell door.    Turning to the left, he moved swiftly and noiselessly along the line of  dungeons, his bare feet making no sound on the flags. He glanced briefly  into each dungeon as he passed it. They were all empty, but locked. In  some he caught the glimmer of naked white bones. These pits were a relic  of a grimmer age, constructed long ago when Belverus was a fortress  rather than a city. But evidently their more recent use had been more  extensive than the world guessed.    Ahead of him, presently, he saw the dim outline of a stair sloping  sharply upward, and knew it must be the stair he sought. Then he whirled  suddenly, crouching in the deep shadows at its foot.    Somewhere behind him something was moving--something bulky and stealthy  that padded on feet which were not human feet. He was looking down the  long row of cells, before each one of which lay a square of dim gray  light that was little more than a patch of less dense darkness. But he  saw something moving along these squares. What it was he could not tell,  but it was heavy and huge, and yet it moved with more than human ease  and swiftness. He glimpsed it as it moved across the squares of gray,  then lost it as it merged in the expanses of shadow between. It was  uncanny, in its stealthy advance, appearing and disappearing like a blur  of the vision.    He heard the bars rattle as it tried each door in turn. Now it had  reached the cell he had so recently quitted, and the door swung open as  it tugged. He saw a great bulky shape limned faintly and briefly in the  gray doorway, and then the thing had vanished into the dungeon. Sweat  beaded Conan's face and hands. Now he knew why Tarascus had come so  subtly to his door, and later had fled so swiftly. The king had unlocked  his door, and, somewhere in these hellish pits, had opened a cell or  cage that held some grim monstrosity.    Now the thing was emerging from the cell and was again advancing up the  corridor, its misshapen head close to the ground. It paid no more heed  to the locked doors. It was smelling out his trail. He saw it more  plainly now; the gray light limned a giant anthropomorphic body, but  vaster of bulk and girth than any man. It went on two legs, though it  stooped forward, and it was grayish and shaggy, its thick coat shot with  silver. Its head was a grisly travesty of the human, its long arms hung  nearly to the ground.    Conan knew it at last--understood the meaning of those crushed and  broken bones in the dungeon, and recognized the haunter of the pits. It  was a gray ape, one of the grisly man-eaters from the forests that wave  on the mountainous eastern shores of the Sea of Vilayet. Half mythical  and altogether horrible, these apes were the goblins of Hyborian  legendry, and were in reality ogres of the natural world, cannibals and  murderers of the nighted forests.    He knew it scented his presence, for it was coming swiftly now, rolling  its barrel-like body rapidly along on its short, mighty bowed legs. He  cast a quick glance up the long stair, but knew that the thing would be  on his back before he could mount to the distant door. He chose to meet  it face to face.    Conan stepped out into the nearest square of moonlight, so as to have  all the advantage of illumination that he could; for the beast, he knew,  could see better than himself in the dark. Instantly the brute saw him;  its great yellow tusks gleamed in the shadows, but it made no sound.  Creatures of night and the silence, the gray apes of Vilayet were  voiceless. But in its dim, hideous features, which were a bestial  travesty of a human face, showed ghastly exultation.    Conan stood poised, watching the oncoming monster without a quiver. He  knew he must stake his life on one thrust; there would be no chance for  another; nor would there be time to strike and spring away. The first  blow must kill, and kill instantly, if he hoped to survive that awful  grapple. He swept his gaze over the short, squat throat, the hairy  swagbelly, and the mighty breast, swelling in giant arches like twin  shields. It must be the heart; better to risk the blade being deflected  by the heavy ribs than to strike in where a stroke was not instantly  fatal. With full realization of the odds, Conan matched his speed of eye  and hand and his muscular power against the brute might and ferocity of  the man-eater. He must meet the brute breast to breast, strike a  death-blow, and then trust to the ruggedness of his frame to survive the  instant of manhandling that was certain to be his.    As the ape came rolling in on him, swinging wide its terrible arms, he  plunged in between them and struck with all his desperate power. He felt  the blade sink to the hilt in the hairy breast, and instantly, releasing  it, he ducked his head and bunched his whole body into one compact mass  of knotted muscles, and as he did so he grasped the closing arms and  drove his knee fiercely into the monster's belly, bracing himself  against"]]]
