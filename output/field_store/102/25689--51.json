The Spanish church, cherishing this element, became a  thing apart from the general Catholicism of Europe. The long warfare  and incidental intercourse with the Moors stamped Spanish Christianity  with its two other characteristic features of mysticism and  fanaticism. \"Mysticism was like a sanctification of African  sensuality, and fanaticism was a turning against ourselves, when the  Reconquest ended, of the fury accumulated during eight centuries of  combat.\"    The author, _muy espanol_, is naturally _muy catolico_, yet he  protests against violence in the repression of other forms of  religion. \"Liberty should bring with it no fear.\" He believes that  Spain is, above all, _sui generis_, independent and individual. The  representative Spaniard is a free lance, striving and conquering by  his own impulse and under his own direction, like the Cid of old or  Cortes in the field of arms, like Loyola in the church, like Cervantes  in letters. He lays stress on the achievements of Spanish art--the  master paintings of Velazquez and Murillo, the master dramas of Lope  de Vega and Calderon, as expressing, better than political history has  expressed, that intensification of Spanish life resulting from the  struggle against the Arabs \"and making of our nation a Christian  Greece.\"      [Illustration: THE COLUMBUS MONUMENT IN GRANADA]    He finds it logical and right that Spain, after her successive  periods of Roman influence, Visigothic influence, Arab influence,  and her modern era of colonial expansion, should now abandon foreign  policies and concentrate all her vitality within her own borders. Not  by the sword, but by the spirit, would he have Spain henceforth hold  sway over mankind, and especially over the Spanish-descended peoples  of South America.    He winces under the monopoly of the term \"American\" by the citizens of  the United States--\"a formidable nation,\" he admits, \"very populous,  very rich, and apparently very well governed.\" He notes, in contrast,  the poverty and comparative anarchy of the South American republics,  but he urges still that the Spanish character, shaped through such  eventful centuries, is an entity, clear and firm, with qualities well  defined, whereas the Yankees are yet in the fusing pot. He would have  all the peoples of Hispanian descent recognize and realize in  themselves this Spanish individuality, effecting not a political  union, but a \"confederation, intellectual and spiritual,\" whose first  aim should be the preservation of Spanish ideas and ideals, and the  second, the free gift of these to all the nations of the earth.    The ancient glory of Spain, he says, has vanished like a dream; let a  new and whiter glory dawn. Her career of material conquest is ended.  Those savage struggles have left her faint and spent. Let her now seek  to attain, through purification and discipline, such fresh fulness of  life as shall insure the triumph of her spiritual forces--her fervent  faith and her unworldly wisdom. \"Our Ulysses is Don Quixote.\"          V    IN SIGHT OF THE GIRALDA         \"We were nearing Seville. I felt the eager throbbing of my       heart. Seville had ever been for me the symbol of light, the       city of love and joy.\"--VALDES: _La Hermana San Sulpicio_.      One of the wise sayings of Andalusia runs, \"Do not squeeze the orange  till the juice is bitter.\" And so we said good-by to Granada before we  were ready to go, and persuaded ourselves, in defiance of maps and  time-tables, that our shortest route to Seville led by Ronda. The  weather did its very best to dampen our enthusiasm for this wildest of  crag aeries, equally famed for romantic beauty of outlook and  salubrity of air. Men live long in Ronda, unless, indeed, they hit  against a bullet while practising their hereditary trade of  _contrabandista_. They have a saying that octogenarians there are only  chickens, but one should not believe all that they say in Ronda. Did  we not clamber, slipping on wet stones, down a precipitous path to  peer, from under dripping umbrellas, at what our guide declared was an  old Roman bridge? \"It doesn't look old and it doesn't look Roman,\" was  the artist's dubious comment, but our highly recommended conductor, a  Gib, as the English-Spanish natives of Gibraltar Rock are called,  assured us that it was built in the days of Julius Caesar, but had been  wonderfully well preserved. We eyed him thoughtfully, bearing in mind  that he had already pointed out the statue of a long-dead poet as a  living politician; but we meekly continued through the lashing rain to  follow his long footsteps over the breakneck ways of that natural  fortress where race after race has left its autograph. The Roman  columns of the church make the Arab cupolas look young, and put the  Gothic choir altogether out of countenance. A bright-shawled peasant  woman, who we fondly hoped might be a smuggler's wife, drew us  delicious water from a Roman well in a Moorish patio, where a mediaeval  king of gentle memory used to drink his wine from cups wrought of the  skulls of those enemies whom he had beheaded with his own sword. But  not all this, and more, could efface our doubts of that Roman bridge,  which, indeed, we found, on a belated perusal of our guide-books, had  been erected by a Malaga architect in the last century.    The street rabble of Ronda was the rudest and fiercest we encountered  anywhere in Spain. Several times our guide wheeled suddenly to  confront some gypsyish lad, creeping up behind us with stone all ready  to throw, and when, at a glint of sunset through the stormy clouds, we  tried to slip out unattended to the neighboring _alameda_, with its  far-sweeping prospect of folded mountain ranges and its vertical view  of gorge and rushing river, the children actually hounded us back to  the hotel. Their leader was a scrofulous boy, with one cheek eaten  away, who had been taught to press his face so closely upon strangers  that, in fear of his open sore, they would hastily give money to keep  him back. He was a merry scamp and got a world of sport out of his  sickening business, laughing at the top of his voice to see himself  \"avoided like the sun.\"    Although the tempest had lulled by evening, Ronda, still inhospitable,  would not let us sleep. All up and down the window-grated street  sounded, from midnight to morning, a tinkling of guitars. It was,  forsooth, St. Joseph's Day, and every Don Jose, every Dona Josefa,  every little Pepe, every pretty Pepita, must be saluted by a serenade.  All Andalusians are musical, taking much pleasure, moreover, in one of  their own bits of philosophy, \"The poorest player has his uses, for he  can at least drive the rats out of the house.\" Rats or no, we left  Ronda by the morning train.    Our carriage was crowded with several Spaniards and a \"Jew-Gib,\" who,  without saying \"_oxte ni moxte_,\" assumed full charge of us and our  belongings for the journey. This unceremonious but really helpful  escort put every one of his fellow-travellers through a sharp  catechism as to birthplace, business, destination, and the like. Our  turn came first of all. \"You are English?\" \"We speak English.\" \"Ha!\"  He fell into our own vernacular. \"Came about three thousand miles to  Spain?\" \"Across the channel.\" He chuckled with prompt appreciation of  the situation and mendaciously translated to the carriage at large,  \"The ladies are distinguished Londoners, on their way to visit  relatives in Seville,\" whereat the Andalusians smiled sleepily upon us  and asked permission to smoke. We consented cheerfully, as our Spanish  sisters had taught us that we should. \"I like it,\" one pallid senora  had said on an earlier trip. \"It makes me sick, yes, but men ought to  be men.\"    We were journeying toward the very palace of the sun, with gray ranks  of olive trees standing guard on either hand. \"And posted among them,  like white doves, could be seen now and again a few mills where the  bitter olive is wont to pour its juice.\" Orange plantations and hedges  of the bluish aloe, fig trees, palms, and all manner of strange,  tropical flowers gladdened our approach to Seville. And when, at last,  we saw from afar the world-praised Giralda, the Moorish bell-tower of  the cathedral, soaring pink into a purple sky, we felt as if we were  really arrived in fairyland.    Our friendly Gib put his tall figure between us and the howling press  of swarthy porters and cab-drivers, scolded, expostulated, threatened,  picked out his men, beat down their prices, called up a policeman to  witness the bargain and take the number of our cab, raised his hat,  and vanished into grateful memory.    Six weeks in Seville! And six weeks in a Seville home, where evening  after evening the gay youth of Andalusia laughed and sang, danced and  rattled the castanets, and cast about our wondering Western souls  strange witcheries from which we shall never more go free. It was all  as Oriental as a dream. The Sultana of the South lifted her gleaming  coronet of domes and pinnacles above such a kingdom of idle, delicious  mirth as has permanently unfitted us for considering it important to  do our duty. Our hereditary bits of Plymouth Rock were melted up in  that fervent heat. Right or wrong? \"Where there is music, there can be  no harm.\" True or false?         \"In this world, my masters,         There's neither truth nor lie,       But all things take the color         Of the glass before the eye.\"    Only six weeks, and yet we shall ever go homesick for Seville, for her  palm trees and orange gardens, her narrow streets like lanes of  shadow, her tiled and statued patios, with caged birds singing answer  to the ripple of the fountain, the musical midnight cry of her  _serenos_, \"her black and burning eyes like beacons in the dark,\" her  sighing serenaders, \"lyrical "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#9)"],[1,"hammock and lay down, heavily. For  the first time since Baby's advent at The Place, he was unhappy--very,  _very_ unhappy. He had had to jostle and fend off Lady, whom he  worshipped. And he knew it would be many a long day before his  sensitively temperamental mate would forgive or forget. Meantime, so  far as Lady was concerned, he was in Coventry.    And just because he had saved from injury a Baby who had meant no harm  and who could not help herself! Life, all at once, seemed dismayingly  complex to Lad's simple soul.    He whimpered a little, under his breath; and lifted his head toward  Baby's dangling hand for a caress that might help make things  easier. But Baby had been bitterly chagrined at Lady's reception of  her friendly advances. Lady could not be punished for this. But Lad  could.    She slapped the lovingly upthrust muzzle with all her feeble  force. For once, Lad was not amused by the castigation. He sighed, a  second time; and curled up on the floor beside the hammock, in a right  miserable heap; his head between his tiny forepaws, his great  sorrowful eyes abrim with bewildered grief.    Spring drowsed into early summer. And, with the passing days, Baby  continued to look less and less like an atrophied mummy, and more like  a thin, but normal, child of five. She ate and slept, as she had not  done for many a month.    The lower half of her body was still dead. But there was a faint glow  of pink in the flat cheeks, and the eyes were alive once more. The  hands that pulled at Lad, in impulsive friendliness or in punishment,  were stronger, too. Their fur-tugs hurt worse than at first. But the  hurt always gave Lad that same twinge of pleasure--a twinge that  helped to ease his heart's ache over the defection of Lady.    On a hot morning in early June, when the Mistress and the Master had  driven over to the village for the mail, the child's mother wheeled  the invalid chair to a tree-roofed nook down by the lake--a spot whose  deep shade and lush long grass promised more coolness than did the  veranda.    It was just the spot a city-dweller would have chosen for a nap--and  just the spot through which no countryman would have cared to venture,  at that dry season, without wearing high boots.    Here, not three days earlier, the Master had killed a copperhead  snake. Here, every summer, during the late June mowing, The Place's  scythe-wielders moved with glum caution. And seldom did their progress  go unmarked by the scythe-severed body of at least one snake.    The Place, for the most part, lay on hillside and plateau, free from  poisonous snakes of all kinds, and usually free from mosquitoes as  well. The lawn, close-shaven, sloped down to the lake. To one side  of it, in a narrow stretch of bottom-land, a row of weeping willows  pierced the loose stone lake-wall.    Here, the ground was seldom bone-dry. Here, the grass grew rankest.  Here, also, driven to water by the drought, abode eft, lizard  and an occasional snake, finding coolness and moisture in the long  grass, and a thousand hiding places amid the stone-crannies or the  lake-wall.    If either the Mistress or the Master had been at home on this morning,  the guest would have been warned against taking Baby there at all. She  would have been doubly warned against the folly which she now  proceeded to commit--of lifting the child from the wheel-chair, and  placing her on a spread rug in the grass, with her back to the low  wall.    The rug, on its mattress of lush grasses, was soft. The lake breeze  stirred the lower boughs of the willows. The air was pleasantly cool  here, and had lost the dead hotness that brooded over the higher  ground.    The guest was well pleased with her choice of a resting place. Lad was  not.    The big dog had been growingly uneasy from the time the wheel-chair  approached the lake-wall. Twice he put himself in front of it; only  to be ordered aside. Once the wheels hit his ribs with jarring  impact. As Baby was laid upon her grassy bed, Lad barked loudly and  pulled at one end of the rug with his teeth.    The guest shook her parasol at him and ordered him back to the  house. Lad obeyed no orders, save those of his two deities. Instead of  slinking away, he sat down beside the child; so close to her that his  ruff pressed against her shoulder. He did not lie down as usual, but  sat--tulip ears erect, dark eyes cloudy with trouble; head turning  slowly from side to side, nostrils pulsing.    To a human, there was nothing to see or hear or smell--other than the  cool beauty of the nook, the soughing of the breeze in the willows,  the soft fragrance of a June morning. To a dog, there were faint  rustling sounds that were not made by the breeze. There were equally  faint and elusive scents that the human nose could not register.  Notably, a subtle odor as of crushed cucumbers. (If ever you have  killed a pit-viper, you know that smell.)    The dog was worried. He was uneasy. His uneasiness would not let him  sit still. It made him fidget and shift his position; and, once or  twice, growl a little under his breath.    Presently, his eyes brightened, and his brush began to thud gently on  the rug-edge. For, a quarter mile above, The Place's car was turning  in from the highway. In it were the Mistress and the Master, coming  home with the mail. Now everything would be all right. And the onerous  duties of guardianship would pass to more capable hands.    As the car rounded the corner of the house and came to a stop at the  front door, the guest caught sight of it. Jumping up from her seat on  the rug, she started toward it in quest of mail. So hastily did she  rise that she dislodged one of the wall's small stones and sent it  rattling down into a wide crevice between two larger rocks.    She did not heed the tinkle of stone on stone; nor a sharp little hiss  that followed, as the falling missile smote the coils of a sleeping  copperhead snake in one of the wall's lowest cavities. But Lad heard  it. And he heard the slithering of scales against rocksides, as the  snake angrily sought new sleeping quarters.    The guest walked away, all ignorant of what she had done. And, before  she had taken three steps, a triangular grayish-ruddy head was pushed  out from the bottom of the wall.    Twistingly, the copperhead glided out onto the grass at the very edge  of the rug. The snake was short, and thick, and dirty, with a distinct  and intricate pattern interwoven on its rough upper body. The head  was short, flat, wedge-shaped. Between eye and nostril, on either  side, was the sinister \"pinhole,\" that is the infallible mark of the  poison-sac serpent.    (The rattlesnake swarms among some of the stony mountains of the North  Jersey hinterland; though seldom, nowadays, does it venture into  the valleys. But the copperhead--twin brother in murder to the  rattler--still infests meadow and lakeside. Smaller, fatter, deadlier  than the diamond-back, it gives none of the warning which redeems the  latter from complete abhorrence. It is a creature as evil as its own  aspect--and name. Copperhead and rattlesnake are the only pit-vipers  left now between Canada and Virginia.)    Out from its wall-cranny oozed the reptile. Along the fringe of the  rug it moved for a foot or two; then paused uncertain--perhaps  momentarily dazzled by the light. It stopped within a yard of the  child's wizened little hand that rested idle on the rug. Baby's other  arm was around Lad, and her body was between him and the snake.    Lad, with a shiver, freed himself from the frail embrace and got  nervously to his feet.    There are two things--and perhaps _only_ two things--of which the best  type of thoroughbred collie is abjectly afraid and from which he will  run for his life. One is a mad dog. The other is a poisonous  snake. Instinct, and the horror of death, warn him violently away from  both.    At stronger scent, and then at sight of the copperhead, Lad's stout  heart failed him. Gallantly had he attacked human marauders who had  invaded The Place. More than once, in dashing fearlessness, he had  fought with dogs larger than himself. With a d'Artagnan-like gaiety  of zest, he had tackled and deflected a bull that had charged head  down at the Mistress.    Commonly speaking, he knew no fear. Yet now he was afraid; tremulously,  quakingly, _sickly_ afraid. Afraid of the deadly thing that was  halting within three feet of him, with only the Baby's fragile body  as a barrier between.    Left to himself, he would have taken, incontinently, to his heels.  With the lower animal's instinctive appeal to a human in moments  of danger, he even pressed closer to the helpless child at his  side, as if seeking the protection of her humanness. A great wave of  cowardice shook the dog from foot to head.    The Master had alighted from the car; and was coming down the hill,  toward his guest, with several letters in his hand. Lad cast a  yearning look at him. But the Master, he knew, was too far away to be  summoned in time by even the most imperious bark.    And it was then that the child's straying gaze fell on the snake.    With a gasp and a shudder, Baby shrank back against Lad. At least, the  upper half of her body moved away from the peril. Her legs and feet  lay inert. The motion jerked the rug's fringe an inch or two,  disturbing the copperhead. The snake coiled, and drew back its  three-cornered head, the forklike maroon tongue playing fitfully.    With a cry of panic-fright at her own impotence to escape, the child  caught up a picture book from the rug beside her, and flung it at the  serpent. The fluttering book missed its mark. But it served its  purpose by giving the copperhead reason to believe itself attacked.    Back went the triangular head, farther than ever; and then flashed  forward. The double move was made in the minutest fraction of a  second.    A full third of the squat reddish body going with the blow, the  copperhead"]]]
