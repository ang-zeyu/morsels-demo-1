Let me see! I'll wear white. Adele looks  best in white. Fair people always do, I think.\"    True to her resolve she bathed and dressed without once approaching the  mirror. At length she was ready. She had no doubts as to the result.  Beatrice was possessed with a child's faith; still, her heart began to  beat quickly as she turned slowly and went toward the glass, keeping her  eyes downcast.    \"It's just like a butterfly breaking out of the chrysalis,\" she told  herself nervously. \"I have been an ugly grub for so long that I'm afraid  to try my new wings. Now, ready, Beatrice! One, two, three!--Look, and  see how beautiful you have become.\"    Smilingly she raised her eyes. The smile froze on her lips, and  consternation swept over her face. Her features were distorted and  swollen, and her skin was as yellow as saffron. With her dark eyes,  bleached hair, and white dress the effect was startling. For one long  moment the girl stared at her reflection, and then, as the full  realization of the transformation came home to her, she flung herself  upon the bed with a cry of anguish.    \"It's no use,\" she wailed. \"Everything is against me. I look worse than  ever. What shall I do? What shall I do?\"    A knock sounded on the door just then, and Bee started up, fearing that  it was her father.    \"Yes?\" she called.    \"Yer pa am a-waitin' fer yer, Miss Bee,\" came the voice of Aunt Fanny.  \"He say de brek'fus am gittin' cole.\"    \"Aunt Fanny, come here!\" Beatrice opened the door and pulled the old  woman inside. \"Look at my face! This comes from using that jimpson weed  poultice. Now what am I going to do?\"    The negress gave a gasp at sight of the girl's face, and threw up her  hands in dismay.    \"Lawsie, chile! How kum yer ter do sech a fool thing? A niggah dunno  nuffin' nohow. 'Sides, yer can't do hit in one night. Co'se not. Takes  two; mebbe three. I dunno.\"    \"Then why did you tell me about it if you didn't know?\" demanded Bee  indignantly. \"You said that it would make me as fair as the lily of the  valley. Now, I've just ruined my face. Oh oh, oh!\"    She began to cry weakly. Aunt Fanny smoothed her hair in an attempt at  consolation.    \"I'se just a low-down niggah ter make yer cry so, Miss Bee,\" she said  remorsefully. \"Dey does use jim'son in de Souf, but mebbe dey puts  sompin elsen wid hit. Nebber you mind. Aunt Fanny'll fin' sumpin ter fix  yer. Now go down ter yer pa. De brek'fus am gittin' cole, an' yer needs  hit hot.\"    \"Go down?\" cried Bee in perturbation. \"I can't go down like this. You  go, and tell father I'm sick. Tell him I can't come. Oh! tell him  anything!\"    \"Beatrice,\" called her father at this moment from the foot of the  stairs, \"is anything the matter? You were not at dinner last night. Are  you ill that you don't come to breakfast?\"    \"I reckon yer shorely in fer hit, Miss Bee,\" spoke Aunt Fanny  commiseratingly. \"If yer sick he's gwine ter kum up anyhow. De bes'  thing is ter go right erlong, and get hit over wid. An' if he scolds  hard yer won't nebber forgib me.\"    \"It is my own fault, Aunt Fanny,\" acknowledged the girl. \"I ought to  have known better than to have done anything of the sort. Now I am in  for it, as you say. Yes; I'll go down. Father can't dislike me any more  than he does, so I might as well face him first as last.\" She rose as  she spoke and went to the door: \"I am all right, father,\" she called.  \"I'll be down in a minute.\"    It was more than a minute before she could pull herself together; then,  summoning all her fortitude, she went slowly down the stairs to the  dining room. Dr. Raymond turned at her entrance.    \"Good morn--\" he began in greeting, but stopped short as though he could  not believe the evidence of his eyes. \"Beatrice Raymond, is that you?\"  he demanded.    \"Yes,\" returned Beatrice as steadily as she could. \"It is I, father. Are  you ready for your coffee?\"    \"What is the meaning of this?\" he asked sharply. \"What have you been  doing to yourself?\"    Something came into Bee's throat and choked her. A moment passed before  she could reply.    \"I have been trying to make myself beautiful, but it did not work well,\"  she said at last in a low tone.    \"Beautiful!\" exclaimed Doctor Raymond in disgust. \"Is vanity also one of  your weaknesses? I begin to believe that you are a bundle of them. Only  a silly, vain girl would be guilty of such folly. I am sorely  disappointed in you, Beatrice.\"    Again Bee choked so that she could not speak, and her eyes swam with  tears. Had she so many follies? People used not to think she was such a  dreadful girl. They used to be fond of her, but everything was going  wrong lately. With hands that shook she silently poured her father's  coffee and handed it to him.    \"How any girl,\" went on her father, seeing that she did not speak, \"how  any girl should go deliberately to work to make such a fright of herself  as you have done is beyond my comprehension. I suppose that all girls  are more or less foolish about their complexions; but no girl of  refinement should bleach her hair. It is an abomination to every  self-respecting person. What caused you to do it?\"    Beatrice's heart was very full. She had done it for his sake, but she  found it impossible to tell him. She had been content enough until he  had come, and was dissatisfied with her. His words hurt her cruelly.  Presently she found her voice:    \"I was trying to look like Adele,\" she told him tearfully.    \"You were?\" Struck by something in her tone the scientist glanced at her  more closely. He saw that she was not eating anything, and that she was  trembling. His manner softened. Bee was aware of the change instantly,  and attributed it to the mention of her cousin. Her tears dried, and she  was shaken with sudden anger.    \"Your cousin is a beautiful girl, Beatrice. She seems to be as lovely in  disposition as in person. I do not at all wonder that you desire to be  like her, but your manner of emulation has not been the most happy.  Perhaps I spoke too severely. We are all prone to error, and I should  not judge too harshly what, it seems, has been done from a worthy  motive. If you wish to be like Adele, strive to copy her character  rather than to imitate her outward appearance. Beauty of soul is the  thing that counts. Before a sweet disposition and a well informed mind  mere physical beauty palls.\"    \"That is not true,\" burst from Beatrice; \"and you know it.\"    \"Beatrice Raymond, do you know to whom you are speaking?\" The naturalist  dropped his knife and fork, and stared at his daughter in amazement.    \"Yes, I do;\" answered Bee, wrought up to such a pitch that she forgot  the respect and deference due her father. If the mere mention of her  cousin's name had such influence upon him, she would let him know how  she felt about it; so she continued wrathfully: \"You and Aunt Annie, and  everybody, are fond of talking about the cultivation of the mind and  spirit being above beauty, but you don't practice what you preach. Look  at what you have been saying, and then think of how you have treated  me.\"    \"Why, why,\" stammered Doctor Raymond, so surprised by this vehement  outburst that he scarcely knew what to say.    \"You were away ten long, long years,\" went on Beatrice, almost beside  herself with passion; all her pent-up unhappiness clamoring for  utterance. \"I was just crazy for you to come home. Other girls had their  fathers and I wanted mine too. When you wrote that you were coming I was  happy; as happy as a bird. You had written that you wished my mind  cultivated, and I studied hard to please you. I knew that you were a  learned man, and I wanted to be able to talk to you intelligently. You  wanted me to learn to be a good housekeeper, and that, too, I studied. I  have tried to do everything that you wished me to. You say that you are  disappointed in me. How do you think that I feel about you? You will  have nothing to say to me because I am not Adele. You wanted her for  your daughter, and you can't get over it because she isn't. In your last  letter to me you said that you thought that I must have a mind of  uncommon intelligence. Have I? You have not troubled to find out. What  kind of a disposition have I? You don't know. And why? Just because I  don't happen to be pretty. 'Sweet disposition and well informed mind'  are all very well to talk about, but when it comes right down to real  truth a girl might as well be dead if she isn't pretty.\"    \"You are giving me a terrible arraignment, Beatrice,\" observed her  father gravely. \"Really, I--\"    \"Isn't it all true?\" demanded Bee with startling directness.    \"I think that probably some of it is,\" admitted Doctor Raymond  guardedly. \"The discussion of beauty and non-beauty we will not prolong  because we could come to no satisfactory conclusion on the matter. It is  an old, old question. Beauty undoubtedly has its influence upon us all;  chiefly, perhaps, because it at once attracts the attention. After all,  it is but a free gift of nature accorded to its possessor by accident.  It was not altogether Adele's beauty that caused me to claim her for my  daughter.\"    \"But--\" began Beatrice.    \"Allow me the privilege of a word, my daughter. The unfortunate mistake  of the picture is largely responsible for this whole affair. I naturally  looked long and often at the photograph, supposing it to be yours.  Seeing her standing in the doorway I recognized the girl whom I supposed  was my daughter. Surely this explanation ought to excuse me, Beatrice?\"    \"But it was her picture that brought you home, father,\" wailed Bee  miserably. \"You would never have come had it been really mine. Oh, that  is what I can't bear!\"    \"I seem unfortunate in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33434"],[0,"The Squirrels and other animals (#9)"],[1,"into the wheat-field for a red poppy-head, which she persuaded mamma to  eat, and soon after she became quiet, and slept all the next day and  night. Then we were terribly afraid that she had taken so much of this  powerful medicine that she would never wake again; and though Sleek  said that she was not at all alarmed, I am sure she seemed very nervous  and agitated, till at last our dear mother opened her eyes, and asked  for some food.    In one corner of our field was an old deserted stable, which we  sometimes visited, partly for the sake of a few horse-beans which we  found on the floor, and partly to have a chat with a very odd creature  who had taken up his abode there, and with whom we had formed a sort of  acquaintance. This creature was an immense _toad_, a very strange  companion, you will say, for a family of little mice. Certainly, he  _was_ an odd fellow, and a very ugly fellow too; but then he had the  most beautiful eyes in the world, and I am sure he gave us very good  advice, if we had been wise enough to have attended to it, instead of  laughing at his croaking voice, and formal manner of talking.    The first time we visited the hermit, as we called him, after the loss  of our brother, we were almost afraid to tell him of the accident,  expecting he would say that poor Softsides was rightly served, and that  we should all perish like him, by our folly, if we did not pay a little  more attention to the advice of our elders. But Toady had a more  feeling heart than you would have supposed from his manners and  appearance, and when he had heard the sad tale to an end, and we were  expecting a terrible lecture, he closed his searching eyes for a minute  or two, and then said,    \"Children, I commiserate your distress. My spirit is pained, yea, what  if I say, sorely troubled and grieved, at this sad catastrophe!  Unfortunate Softsides! truly he was a handsome juvenal, and active of  limb withal. Know, my children, that he found favour in my sight, more  especially inasmuch as I have sometimes thought that I resembled him  not a little, both in feature and disposition, in the joyous days of my  youth. Leave me now to meditate for a season upon this grievous  visitation. In that corner you will find a few beans which I have  collected for you. Peradventure, when you have finished them, I may  relate some little tale or fable for your amusement. Yea, and for your  instruction also, if you will receive it.\"    So when we had finished the luncheon which the good hermit had provided  for us, we seated ourselves around the entrance of his hole, when,  after a few minutes' recollection, and his usual preparation for a  speech, by closing his eyes for a time, he related the following        FABLE OF THE SUNFLOWER AND THE MIGNIONETTE.    A gigantic Sunflower reared his many-headed stem very far above all the  other plants in the parterre, and affected not a little to despise  their lowly condition and insignificance. A bed of Mignionette, which  grew close to him, particularly excited the anger of this arrogant  fellow. And \"what,\" exclaimed he, \"could the stupid gardener be  thinking of, when he planted such miserable, little half-starved  wretches as you in the same border as a kingly Sunflower! Does not my  very name declare my rank and noble origin, in token whereof, I never  fail to pay my respects to the glorious lord of the skies, by turning  my head towards him, whenever he deigns to remove the misty veil from  his countenance? But as for you---- By the by, do you ever mean to  blossom, or have you the vanity to say, that those yellowish tufts  (which at this height I can hardly distinguish from leaves) deserve the  name of flowers? Ridiculous! I have a great mind to say, that if the  mistress of this garden does not remove you, and some other of your  vulgar companions, a little further off, I won't expand another blossom  this summer; I'll kill myself in spite! I will, I declare!\"    The Mignionette plants were so diverted at this threat, that for some  time they could not reply to his abusive speech. At length one of them  quietly said, \"Vain babbler! to be angry at thy impertinence would  prove that we were as silly as thyself. But know this, thou  empty-pated, and worthless one,--though mean in appearance, and  dwarfish in stature, we are nevertheless especial favourites with our  mistress, who is so delighted with the rich perfume of our 'yellowish  tufts,' as thou hast the impertinence to call them, that she frequently  honours them with a place in her bosom. Flowers must be very scarce  before any of thy huge gaudy-coloured blossoms attain to that envied  situation, I trow. But thy pride will soon be humbled, for yesterday I  overheard our mistress complaining of thy encroaching shade, and  directing the gardener to root thee up, and cast thee forth, to rot  like a vile weed upon the dunghill, that the more humble inhabitants of  the flower-bed may benefit by the life-bestowing rays of that being  whom we all worship, though we are not honoured, like thyself, by  bearing his name. Lo! while I speak, the gardener draweth near with his  spade, and thy destruction is at hand.\"                     *       *       *       *       *    Our hermit was explaining to us how we might derive instruction from  this fable, when suddenly a fierce weasel and a half-grown young one  bounced in through the open doorway; but fortunately for us poor  little mice they did not see us for half a minute, and this delay  enabled the worthy Toady to save our lives. Scrambling out of his  hole, with a great deal more activity than could be expected in such a  corpulent old gentleman, he exclaimed, \"Enter speedily, my children!\"  For once we followed his advice, without asking for a reason why; but  we had hardly time to take refuge, when Mother Weasel espied the last  tail whisking into the hole, and screeching out to her son, \"A prey!  a prey! I thought I smelt mice!\" at a single bound she reached the  entrance. She was too late, for our protector had backed his fat body  into the hole, which he fitted so exactly, that the smallest beetle  could hardly have passed him. \"Friend Weasel,\" said he, \"I dispute not  that thou mayst have _smelt_ mice, but this day shalt thou _taste_  none, if my protection availeth anything. Verily, it appeareth to me  that for once in thy life thou art baulked.\"    Now you must know that most animals are rather afraid to attack a toad,  believing that he is a magician, and has the power of injuring his  enemies by spitting at them. Whether this be true or not I cannot say,  but I am sure that our friend was the most quiet, inoffensive creature  on earth. But Mrs. Weasel seemed to think differently, for bounding  away towards the door-way, she said to her son, \"Come along, my boy! my  nose tells me that they are nothing but little miserable harvest-mice.  Let us try if we cannot meet with some of the great fat field-mice in  the wheat-field, they are six times as large as these little wretches.  For my part I am not at all hungry, but 'tis glorious fun hunting them  to death.\"    But there was another animal close at hand, who was also very fond of  hunting, and for the same reason; because he thought it was \"_glorious  fun_.\" This was the little terrier dog \"Pepper,\" whose master, Farmer  Winter, had come into the meadow that morning, to see how his sheep  were getting on. Now it so happened that \"Pep\" took it into his random  head to visit the stable, and he entered exactly as Mistress and Master  W. were going out. Of course our situation prevented us from witnessing  this interesting meeting, but we heard a scuffle, and two loud squeaks,  which our protector, who saw the whole affair from the mouth of his  den, informed us were the last sounds ever uttered by the long-backed  mother and son. But though Pepper had kindly shaken our enemies to  death, we did not like to trust ourselves in his power, thinking that  he would most likely serve us in the same manner; so we remained  quietly in the hole, till our kind friend had seen that the coast was  clear, and then, having thanked him for his protection, we ran home as  fast as possible.    We passed by the dead bodies of the weasels, and found that they were  much handsomer animals than we had supposed, for though their backs  were ridiculously long, their colours were very pretty; a beautiful  reddish brown on the upper parts, but underneath they were as white as  snow, or as your frock, my dear mistress. The hermit informed us  afterwards, that they are the boldest animals for their size in the  world, and that they will sometimes kill even young rabbits and hares.  He said, that when a weasel attacks an animal so much larger than  himself, he sticks fast to his neck, and though the poor creature runs  away, he cannot get rid of his tormentor, but is soon exhausted and  killed. Toady said, he once saw a weasel seized by a kite, and carried  up into the air. After a little while, however, the bird began to fly  very oddly, as if in pain, and at last fell down quite dead, close to  the spot where the hermit was sitting. While he was in the air the  weasel had killed the kite by gnawing a great hole in his side. So they  both came down together, but the conqueror was not at all injured by  his fall.    After our fortunate escape, nothing worth relating occurred till the  day I was caught by that cruel boy from whose hands you so kindly  rescued me. Being now nearly full grown our mother allowed us to take  care of ourselves in the daytime, but she made two of my sisters and  myself sleep in the nest with her at night.    One morning, wishing to see a little of the world, I set off by myself  across the meadow, intending to visit a pleasant little wood we could  just see from the bank above our house. But I had hardly reached the  middle of the field, when a tremendous hail-storm came on. Oh! what a  dreadful predicament I was in! "]]]
