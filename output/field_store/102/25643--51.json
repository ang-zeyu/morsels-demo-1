Frequently, however, the  megascleres or skeleton-spicules are not the only spicules present, for  we find smaller spicules (microscleres) of one or more kinds lying loose  in the substance of the sponge and in the external membrane, or, in the  Spongillidae only, forming a special armature for the reproductive bodies  known as gemmules.    All sponges obtain their food in the same way, namely by means of the  currents of water set up by the flagella of the collar-cells. These  flagella, although apparently there is little concerted action among  them, cause by their rapid movements changes of pressure in the water  contained in the cavities of the sponge. The water from outside  therefore flows in at the pores and finally makes its way out of the  oscula. With the water minute particles of organic matter are brought  into the sponge, the collar-cells of which, and probably other cells,  have the power of selecting and engulfing suitable particles. Inside the  cells these particles undergo certain chemical changes, and are at least  partially digested. The resulting substances are then handed on directly  to other cells, or, as some assert, are discharged into the common  jelly, whence they are taken up by other cells.    Sponges reproduce their kind in more ways than one, _viz._, by means of  eggs (which are fertilized as in other animals by spermatozoa), by means  of buds, and by means of the peculiar bodies called gemmules the  structure and origin of which is discussed below (p. 42). They are of  great importance in the classification of the Spongillidae. Sponges can  also be propagated artificially by means of fission, and it is probable  that this method of reproduction occurs accidentally, if not normally,  in natural circumstances.      GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE SPONGILLIDAE.    It would be impracticable in this introduction to give a full account of  the structure of the Spongillidae, which in some respects is still  imperfectly known. Students who desire further information should  consult Professor Minchin's account of the sponges in Lankester's  'Treatise on Zoology,' part ii, or, if a less technical description is  desired, Miss Sollas's contribution to the 'Cambridge Natural History,'  vol. i, in which special attention is paid to _Spongilla_.    The diagram reproduced in fig. 1 gives a schematic view of a vertical  section through a living freshwater sponge. Although it represents the  structure of the organism as being very much simpler than is actually  the case, and entirely omits the skeleton, it will be found useful as  indicating the main features of the anatomy.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Diagram of a vertical section through a  freshwater sponge (_modified from Kuekenthal_).    A=pores; B=subdermal cavity; C=inhalent canal; D=ciliated chamber;  E=exhalent canal; F=osculum; G=dermal membrane; H=eggs; J=gemmule.]    It will be noted that the diagram represents an individual with a single  osculum or exhalent aperture. As a rule adult Demospongiae have several  or many oscula, but even in the Spongillidae sponges occur in which there  is only one. New oscula are formed by a kind of proliferation that  renders the structure still more complex than it is when only one  exhalent aperture is present.    The little arrows in the figure indicate the direction of the currents  of water that pass through the sponge. It enters through small holes in  the derma into a subdermal cavity, which separates the membrane from the  bulk of the sponge. This space differs greatly in extent in different  species. From the subdermal space the water is forced by the action of  the flagella into narrow tubular canals that carry it into the ciliated  chambers. Thence it passes into other canals, which communicate with  what remains of the central cavity, and so out of the oscula.    The ciliated chambers are very minute, and the collar-cells excessively  so. It is very difficult to examine them owing to their small size and  delicate structure. Fig. 2 D represents a collar-cell of a sponge seen  under a very high power of the microscope in ideal conditions.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Sponge cells.

At any rate this is the case as regards the Indian _Spongillae_.  In all species the membrane is composed of flattened cells of irregular  shape fitted together like the pieces of a puzzle-picture. In some  species (e. g., _Spongilla carteri_) the apertures in the membrane  consist merely of spaces between adjacent cells, which may be a little  more crowded together than is usual. But in others (e. g., _Spongilla  proliferens_ and _Spongilla crassissima_) in which the pores are  extremely small, each pore normally pierces the middle of a flat,  ring-shaped cell or porocyte. Occasionally, however, a pore may be found  that is enclosed by two narrow, crescent-shaped cells joined together at  their tips to form a ring. The porocytes of sponges like _Spongilla  carteri_ are probably not actually missing, but instead of being in the  external membrane are situated below the derma at the external entrance  to the canals that carry water to the flagellated chambers or even at  the entrance to the chambers themselves[L]. Some authors object on  theoretical grounds to the statement that porocytes exist in the  Demospongia, and it is possible that these cells have in this grade  neither the same origin as, nor a precisely similar function to, the  porocytes of other sponges. When they occur in the dermal membrane no  great difficulty is experienced in seeing them under a sufficiently high  power of the microscope, if the material is well preserved and mounted  and stained in a suitable manner[M]. In most sponges the porocytes can  contract in such a way that the aperture in their centre is practically  closed, but this power appears to be possessed by the porocytes of  _Spongilla_ only to a very limited extent, although they closely  resemble the porocytes of other sponges in appearance.         [Footnote L: _Cf._ Weltner, \"Spongillidenstudien, V,\" Arch.       Naturg. Berlin, lxxiii (i), p. 273 (1907).]         [Footnote M: It is difficult to see any trace of them in       thin microtome sections. A fragment of the membrane must be       mounted whole.]    The external membrane in many Spongillidae is prolonged round and above  the oscula so as to form an oscular collar. This structure is highly  contractile, but cannot close together. As a rule it is much more  conspicuous in living sponges than in preserved specimens.    It is not necessary to deal here with most of the cells that  occur in the parenchyma or gelatinous part of the sponge. A full  list of the kinds that are found is given by Dr. Weltner in his  \"Spongillidenstudien, V,\" p. 276 (Arch. Naturg. Berlin, lxxiii (i),  1907). One kind must, however, be briefly noticed as being of some  systematic importance, namely the \"bubble-cells\" (fig. 2 A) that are  characteristic of some species of _Ephydatia_ and other genera. These  cells are comparatively large, spherical in form; each of them contains  a globule of liquid which not only occupies the greater part of the  cell, but forces the protoplasm to assume the form of a delicate film  lining the cell-wall and covering the globule. In optical section  \"bubble-cells\" have a certain resemblance to porocytes, but the cell is  of course imperforate and not flattened.      SKELETON AND SPICULES.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Radial sections of fragments of the skeletons of  _Spongillae_.    A, _S. crassissima_ var. _crassior_ (from Rajshahi); B, _S. carteri_  (from Calcutta); _a_=transverse, _b_=radiating fibres; _e_=external  surface of the sponge.]    In the Spongillidae the spicules and the skeleton are more important as  regards the recognition of genera and species than the soft parts. The  skeleton is usually reticulate, but sometimes consists of a mass of  spicules almost without arrangement. The amount of spongin present is  also different in different species. The spicules in a reticulate  skeleton are arranged so as to form fibres of two kinds--radiating  fibres, which radiate outwards from the centre of the sponge and  frequently penetrate the external membrane, and transverse fibres, which  run across from one radiating fibre to another. The fibres are composed  of relatively large spicules (megascleres) arranged parallel to one  another, overlapping at the ends, and bound together by means of a more  or less profuse secretion of spongin. In some species they are actually  enclosed in a sheath of this substance. The radiating fibres are usually  more distinct and stouter than the transverse ones, which are often  represented by single spicules but are sometimes splayed out at the ends  so as to assume in outline the form of an hour-glass (fig. 3 B). The  radiating fibres frequently raise up the membrane at their free  extremities just as a tent-pole does a tent.    Normal spicules of the skeleton are always rod-like or needle-like, and  either blunt or pointed at both ends; they are either smooth, granular,  or covered with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36564"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 3, October, 1851 (#9)"],[1,"if my countrymen object, as some  of them do, to its principles, I tell them fairly that beggars cannot be  choosers. I can live, thank Heaven, in many ways. I could not, indeed, keep  school--as my countrymen, I believe, think every literary man should, the  better to amuse them at his own expense. Two such drains on the  cerebro-nervous system would soon lay me beneath the sod. But I can invest  what remains of my patrimony in wild land, till it for my bread, and write  a tale every winter, in defiance of the buccaneers.    But suppose that we continue to write (as we shall, depend on it), and that  our impracticable Congress--from the difficulty of getting it to look at  any question not bearing upon \"Who is to be the next President?\" or from  the general apathy in regard to the injuries of authors, and want of  perception as to the important interests of the heart--will not or does not  pass an international copyright law, what sense or what honesty will there  be in your strangling yourselves meanwhile by permitting Mr. Bohn his  black-flag reprisals? Whom do you injure by this species of retaliation?  First, and chiefly, your own authors and publishers, and your own  literature (and, therefore, you must abandon such a policy sooner or  later); and next, your friends on this side the water. For what does our  government care if our native authors, even of the highest ability, earn  less than common stevedores? Not a rush. Do the people enjoy our works with  a less magnanimous gusto, because we have coined our brains and hearts in  composing them for bread and patched elbows? Will they be less, in their  own estimation, the greatest, the freest, the wisest, and the most  enlightened nation upon earth? You retaliate, gentlemen, by injuring those  whose sufferings (greater than yours) are already disregarded by the power  you would influence; and if you ruined them, you would not ruffle one  self-complacent feather of the American eagle. You but do what you can to  depress and extinguish the only class of Americans who have a direct  interest in getting you what you want, and who are already as eager to  obtain it as men usually are to protect themselves from ruinous  competition. I do not know what you expect from such a method, unless you  think that our government, which has no pity on its native men of letters,  will be touched by the distresses of yours.    Believe me, further, that it is the most unlikely way to succeed with the  American people, to offer them an international copyright as a matter of  bargain. They immediately suspect a design of obtaining an advantage for  you, without any real equivalent to themselves. Show them, by granting a  free and perfect copyright to all the world, on the same terms as your own  subjects, that you regard such a course as the true policy of every state  (which it is), and you will be much more likely to gain a hearing. I see  nothing in this movement against foreigners getting a copyright, but  selfishness overreaching itself.    The Americans are sometimes obtuse to appeals to their sense of justice,  when they have an immediate interest in repudiating the claim. I admit it  with regret, but it cannot be denied. They do not know how to relinquish  the present advantages of a cheap pirated literature--forgetting that the  endless reading of cheap books is a vice, and that this deluge of foreign  under-priced novels and magazines, good, bad, and indifferent, is washing  away every manly national taste. But on the other hand you are too  grasping. It is undignified and unbecoming. Why should you so eagerly  clutch at a foreign sale for your works, as to sacrifice what you can  secure--freedom from injurious competition at home? For my own part (and I  am sure I speak the sentiments of every American writer of respectability),  give me on this side of the Atlantic, what you may have on yours at  pleasure--a fair chance, without being under-bid by pirates--and I ask no  more. I will cheerfully relinquish all the advantage to be drawn from an  English sale. Without vanity, justly as we are charged with it, or boasting  (our national infirmity--heaven knows we came honestly by it), all we want  is \"a fair field\" at home, \"and no favor,\" and we will write books, if not  intrinsically so good as those of English authors, yet more congenial to  the tastes, and better adapted to supply the intellectual wants, of our  countrymen.    To conclude: although the American people appear at times obtuse, as I have  said, on the question of justice, and take, as in this instance, a \"mighty  narrow\" view of expediency, they are very open to an appeal to their  generosity. Present a bill--above all, an unusual bill--to Brother  Jonathan, and he may dispute it, or turn his back on you with all the  coolness imaginable; but offer to contribute your sovereign for those poor  devils of authors, and he is up to the gentlemanly thing--he will cover  your subscription with an eagle. I should be glad to persuade him to do  justice under the idea that it was a sort of charity, convinced as I am  that, as soon as he had done it, he would see the true nature of the  transaction, and blush to have ever stood out about so plain a thing. You  Englishmen pretend, even in your national capacity, to believe the Bible (I  wish it were true of either us or you). There is one passage which I  commend to your consideration, as bearing directly on the practical  solution of this question, and sustaining my view of it by a sentence which  cannot fail: \"Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed  down, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same  measure that ye mete withal shall it be measured to you again.\" And there  is another maxim more universal still, which among us is thus familiarly  expressed: \"Do as you would be done by.\" By reversing Lord Campbell's  decision, you will act ungenerously, that's certain, and I think, unjustly,  you will injure your own writers more than ours, and rob us of one of our  strongest arguments.

At the beginning of  it a certain preeminence is claimed for England which some have thought  belonged to our own country, but we are not unwilling to yield the  distinction:         \"The science of deception has of late years attained an       immense importance in this good realm of Britain. In other       lands,--as, for example, in France or in America,--it is       practiced with more or less of success and perfection; but       the inherent superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race has       asserted itself even in this sinister and questionable       pursuit, so that we may fairly claim as decided a       preeminence in the arts by which fools are gulled and ruled,       as in those more honorable and useful ones by which we have       attained a moral dominion over the opinions and tastes of       mankind. There may be more _finesse_ in the system of the       French deceivers, or the American 'humbug' may, like the       other indigenous productions of that remarkable land, be a       very monster in the grandeur of his conceptions, and the       enormous force brought to bear on their development; but for       real, sound, profitable, business-like work in this peculiar       line, we back the Britishers against all the world. Like       every thing done in the country, their operations in the art       of deception are steady, systematic and sure.         \"We conceive that we have a right to speak of the 'science'       of deception, for it has all the dignity, symmetry, and       order of the nobler sciences. It has its mysteries, which       are utterly unknown to the uninitiated; it has also its       professors, who are men very often raised by the admiration       of their own dupes to positions of high honor and great       profit. The organization and regulation of its minor       ministrants are also complete, and ere a man can hope to       reach the high places and carry off the rich prizes, he must       go through many grades, and master many secrets, both in       theory and practice. Once initiated, he is able to effect       results, by comparison with which the glory and the honors       reaped by successful soldiers or great discoverers sink into       insignificance.         \"In a former number an attempt was made to explain some of       the means resorted to for the manufacture of public opinion       in England, through the journals and other agents, by which       the public ear is monopolized. We showed that almost any       desired 'public opinion' might be made to order; that there       were great contractors, who would not only undertake the       duty, but who would also fulfil their undertakings. That       similar processes exist in other countries cannot admit of a       doubt, but it is questionable whether the corresponding       effects in France or America are not produced upon a much       lower and more ignorant class of the community, and whether       there are in those countries such masses of wealthy,       intelligent, and educated persons willing to be cajoled,       fleeced, and laughed at, as those we find in our own dearly       beloved country. It might, perhaps, be proved that the arts       of which we speak succeed with the superior classes of our       countrymen in a much larger proportion than with similar       classes elsewhere. This science of deception has, of course,       for its basis, the production of particular 'opinions,' and       the creation of peculiar preferences in the public mind; but       although the great contractors for political opinion"]]]
