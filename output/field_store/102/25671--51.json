A common defence against these unwelcome intruders is to  cover the roofs with a certain prickly shrub, the thorns of which  command respect even from monkeys. Mrs. Bowdich says: \"In some places  they are even fed, encouraged, and allowed to live on the roofs of  houses;\" but this would be where the goods of the householder were  beyond their reach. \"If a man wishes to revenge himself for any injury  committed upon him,\" says Mrs. Bowdich, \"he has only to sprinkle some  rice or corn upon the top of his enemy's house or granary just before  the rain sets in, and the monkeys will assemble upon it, eat all they  can find outside, and then pull off the tiles to get at that which has  fallen through the crevices. This, of course, gives access to the  torrents which fall in such countries, and house, furniture and stores  are all ruined.\" Quoting from another writer, Mrs. Bowdich gives an  amusing description of the way in which one of these monkeys watched his  opportunity for making his descent upon a sweet-stuff shop. Taking up a  position opposite the shop, \"he pretended to be asleep, but every now  and then softly raised his head to look at the tempting piles and the  owner of them, who sat smoking his pipe without symptoms even of a doze.  In half an hour the monkey got up, as if he were just awake, yawned,  stretched himself, and took another position a few yards off, where he  pretended to play with his tail, occasionally looking over his shoulder  at the coveted delicacies. At length the shopman gave signs of activity,  and the monkey was on the alert; the man went to his back room, the  monkey cleared the street at one bound, and in an instant stuffed his  pouches full of the delicious morsels. He had, however, overlooked some  hornets, which were regaling themselves at the same time. They resented  his disturbance, and the tormented monkey, in his hurry to escape, came  upon a thorn-covered roof, where he lay stung, torn, and bleeding. He  spurted the stolen bonbons from his pouches and barked hoarsely looking  the picture of misery. The noise of the tiles which he had dislodged in  his retreat brought out the inhabitants, and among them the vendor of  the sweets, with his turban unwound, and streaming two yards behind him.  All joined in laughing at the wretched monkey; but their religious  reverence for him induced them to go to his assistance: they picked out  his thorns and he limped away to the woods quite crestfallen.\"      The Monkey Outdone.    The writer, from whom Mrs. Bowdich quoted the above story, gives a  graphic account of the success of a stratagem he employed to rid himself  of the unwelcome visits of his monkey friends. \"Although,\" says he, \"a  good deal shyer of me than they were of the natives, I found no  difficulty in getting within a few yards of them; and when I lay still  among the brushwood they gambolled round me with as much freedom as if I  had been one of themselves. This happy understanding, however, did not  last long, and we soon began to urge war upon each other. The _casus  belli_ was a field of sugar-cane which I had planted on the newly  cleared jungle.    \"Every beast of the field seemed leagued against this devoted patch of  sugar-cane. The wild elephants came and browzed in it; the jungle hogs  rooted it up, and munched it at their leisure; the jackals gnawed the  stalks into squash; and the wild deer ate the tops of the young plants.  Against all these marauders there was an obvious remedy,--to build a  stout fence round the cane-field. This was done accordingly; and a deep  trench dug outside, that even the wild elephant did not deem it prudent  to cross. The wild hogs came and inspected the trench and the palisades  beyond. A bristly old tusker was observed taking a survey of the  defences; but, after mature deliberation, he gave two short grunts, the  porcine (language), I imagined, for 'No go,' and took himself off at a  round trot, to pay a visit to my neighbour Ram Chunder, and inquire how  his little plot of sweet yams was coming on. The jackals sniffed at  every crevice, and determined to wait a bit; but the monkeys laughed the  whole entrenchment to scorn. Day after day was I doomed to behold my  canes devoured as fast as they ripened, by troops of jubilant monkeys.  It was of no use attempting to drive them away. When disturbed, they  merely retreated to the nearest tree, dragging whole stalks of  sugar-cane along with them, and then spurted the chewed fragments in my  face, as I looked up at them. This was adding insult to injury; and I  positively began to grow bloodthirsty at the idea of being outwitted by  monkeys. The case between us might have been stated in this way. 'I  have, at much trouble and expense, cleared and cultivated this jungle  land,' said I. 'More fool you,' said the monkeys. 'I have planted and  watched over these sugar-canes.' 'Watched! Ah, ah! so have we, for the  matter of that.' 'But surely I have a right to reap what I sowed.'  'Don't see it,' said the monkeys; 'the jungle, by rights prescriptive  and indefeasible, is ours, and has been so ever since the days of Ram  HanumAin of the long tail. If you cultivate the jungle without our  consent, you must look to the consequences. If you don't like our  customs, you may get about your business. We don't want you.' I kept  brooding over this mortifying view of the matter, until one morning I  hatched revenge in a practicable shape. A tree, with about a score of  monkeys on it, was cut down, and half a dozen of the youngest were  caught as they attempted to escape. A large pot of _ghow_ (treacle) was  then mixed with as much tarter emetic as could be spared from the  medicine chest, and the young hopefuls, after being carefully painted  over with the compound, were allowed to return to their distressed  relatives, who, as soon as they arrived, gathered round them and  commenced licking them with the greatest assiduity. The results I had  anticipated were not long in making their appearance. A more melancholy  sight it was impossible to behold; but so efficacious was this  treatment, that for more than two years I hardly ever saw a monkey in  the neighbourhood.\"      The Monkey Aroused.    Tavernier was once travelling from Agra to Surat with the English  president, when passing within a few miles of Amenabad through a forest  of mangoes, they experienced the danger of provoking such companies. He  says, \"We saw a vast number of very large apes, male and female, many of  the latter having their young in their arms. We were each of us in our  coaches; and the English president stopped his to tell me that he had a  very fine new gun; and knowing that I was a good marksman, desired me to  try it, by shooting one of the apes. One of my servants, who was a  native of the country, made a sign to me not to do it; and I did all  that was in my power to dissuade the gentleman from his design, but to  no purpose; for he immediately levelled his piece, and shot a she ape,  who fell through the branches of the tree on which she was sitting, her  young ones tumbling at the same time out of her arms on the ground. We  presently saw that happen which my servant apprehended; for all the  apes, to the number of sixty, came immediately down from the trees, and  attacked the president's coach with such fury that they must infallibly  have destroyed him if all who were present had not flown to his relief,  and by drawing up the windows, and posting all the servants about the  coach, protected him from their resentment.\" That diplomacy is better  than war in dealing with bands of monkeys is shown by comparing the  results of the foregoing experiences.      The Monkeys' Affection.    That monkeys are capable of very poignant feeling is shown by the  following pathetic story. Mr. Forbes, in his \"Oriental Memoirs,\"  says:--\"On a shooting party one of my friends killed a female monkey,  and carried it to his tent, which was soon surrounded by forty or fifty  of the tribe, who made a great noise, and in a menacing posture advanced  towards it. On presenting his fowling-piece they retreated, but one  stood his ground, chattering and menacing in a furious manner. He at  length came close to the tent door, and finding that his threatenings  were of no avail, began a lamentable moaning, and by every expression of  grief and supplication seemed to beg the body of the deceased. On this  it was given to him. He took it up in his arms, eagerly pressed it to  his bosom, and carried it off in a sort of triumph to his expecting  companions. The artless behaviour of this poor animal wrought so  powerfully on the sportsmen that they resolved never more to level a gun  at one of the monkey tribe.\"      American Monkeys.    To visit the family of the CebidA| we have to cross the Atlantic Ocean,  and here we find characteristics with which the monkeys of the East are  unfamiliar, while we miss others which are common to the monkeys of the  old world. In passing from East to West we lose the cheek-pouch  characteristic and we find that of the prehensile tail. There are more  than eighty species in the family of the CebidA|, divided into ten genera  and grouped in four sub-families. The first of the sub-families includes  the monkeys with prehensile tails.      The Capuchin Monkey.    The capuchins belong to the genus _Cebus_ which includes the majority of  American monkeys. There are a number of species of which the Brown  Capuchin (Brazil), the Wheeper Capuchin (Brazil), and the White-throated  Capuchin (Central America) are the best known.      The Spider Monkeys.    The Spider Monkey is of the genus _Ateles_ and is one of the best known  of the CebidA| family. In it the prehensile tail reaches its perfection.  It is a remarkably sensitive organ, answering the purpose, as the Rev."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#9)"],[1,"you.  Don't let Ken Ford think that all he has to do to get you on a string  is to drop his handkerchief. Have more spirit than that, child.\"    To be thus hectored and patronized by Mary Vance was unendurable! And  it was unendurable to walk on stony roads with blistered heels and bare  feet! And it was unendurable to be crying and have no handkerchief and  not to be able to stop crying!    \"I'm not thinking\"--sniff--\"about Kenneth\"--sniff--\"Ford\"--two  sniffs--\"at all,\" cried tortured Rilla.    \"There's no need to fly off the handle, child. You ought to be willing  to take advice from older people. I saw how you slipped over to the  sands with Ken and stayed there ever so long with him. Your mother  wouldn't like it if she knew.\"    \"I'll tell my mother all about it--and Miss Oliver--and Walter,\" Rilla  gasped between sniffs. \"You sat for hours with Miller Douglas on that  lobster trap, Mary Vance! What would Mrs. Elliott say to that if she  knew?\"    \"Oh, I'm not going to quarrel with you,\" said Mary, suddenly retreating  to high and lofty ground. \"All I say is, you should wait until you're  grown-up before you do things like that.\"    Rilla gave up trying to hide the fact that she was crying. Everything  was spoiled--even that beautiful, dreamy, romantic, moonlit hour with  Kenneth on the sands was vulgarized and cheapened. She loathed Mary  Vance.    \"Why, whatever's wrong?\" cried mystified Mary. \"What are you crying  for?\"    \"My feet--hurt so--\" sobbed Rilla clinging to the last shred of her  pride. It was less humiliating to admit crying because of your feet  than because--because somebody had been amusing himself with you, and  your friends had forgotten you, and other people patronized you.    \"I daresay they do,\" said Mary, not unkindly. \"Never mind. I know where  there's a pot of goose-grease in Cornelia's tidy pantry and it beats  all the fancy cold creams in the world. I'll put some on your heels  before you go to bed.\"    Goose-grease on your heels! So this was what your first party and your  first beau and your first moonlit romance ended in!    Rilla gave over crying in sheer disgust at the futility of tears and  went to sleep in Mary Vance's bed in the calm of despair. Outside, the  dawn came greyly in on wings of storm; Captain Josiah, true to his  word, ran up the Union Jack at the Four Winds Light and it streamed on  the fierce wind against the clouded sky like a gallant unquenchable  beacon.        CHAPTER V    \"THE SOUND OF A GOING\"    Rilla ran down through the sunlit glory of the maple grove behind  Ingleside, to her favourite nook in Rainbow Valley. She sat down on a  green-mossed stone among the fern, propped her chin on her hands and  stared unseeingly at the dazzling blue sky of the August afternoon--so  blue, so peaceful, so unchanged, just as it had arched over the valley  in the mellow days of late summer ever since she could remember.    She wanted to be alone--to think things out--to adjust herself, if it  were possible, to the new world into which she seemed to have been  transplanted with a suddenness and completeness that left her half  bewildered as to her own identity. Was she--could she be--the same  Rilla Blythe who had danced at Four Winds Light six days ago--only six  days ago? It seemed to Rilla that she had lived as much in those six  days as in all her previous life--and if it be true that we should  count time by heart-throbs she had. That evening, with its hopes and  fears and triumphs and humiliations, seemed like ancient history now.  Could she really ever have cried just because she had been forgotten  and had to walk home with Mary Vance? Ah, thought Rilla sadly, how  trivial and absurd such a cause of tears now appeared to her. She could  cry now with a right good will--but she would not--she must not. What  was it mother had said, looking, with her white lips and stricken eyes,  as Rilla had never seen her mother look before,      \"When our women fail in courage,    Shall our men be fearless still?\"    Yes, that was it. She must be brave--like mother--and Nan--and  Faith--Faith, who had cried with flashing eyes, \"Oh, if I were only a  man, to go too!\" Only, when her eyes ached and her throat burned like  this she had to hide herself in Rainbow Valley for a little, just to  think things out and remember that she wasn't a child any longer--she  was grown-up and women had to face things like this. But it  was--nice--to get away alone now and then, where nobody could see her  and where she needn't feel that people thought her a little coward if  some tears came in spite of her.    How sweet and woodsey the ferns smelled! How softly the great feathery  boughs of the firs waved and murmured over her! How elfinly rang the  bells of the \"Tree Lovers\"--just a tinkle now and then as the breeze  swept by! How purple and elusive the haze where incense was being  offered on many an altar of the hills! How the maple leaves whitened in  the wind until the grove seemed covered with pale silvery blossoms!  Everything was just the same as she had seen it hundreds of times; and  yet the whole face of the world seemed changed.    \"How wicked I was to wish that something dramatic would happen!\" she  thought. \"Oh, if we could only have those dear, monotonous, pleasant  days back again! I would never, never grumble about them again.\"    Rilla's world had tumbled to pieces the very day after the party. As  they lingered around the dinner table at Ingleside, talking of the war,  the telephone had rung. It was a long-distance call from Charlottetown  for Jem. When he had finished talking he hung up the receiver and  turned around, with a flushed face and glowing eyes. Before he had said  a word his mother and Nan and Di had turned pale. As for Rilla, for the  first time in her life she felt that every one must hear her heart  beating and that something had clutched at her throat.    \"They are calling for volunteers in town, father,\" said Jem. \"Scores  have joined up already. I'm going in tonight to enlist.\"    \"Oh--Little Jem,\" cried Mrs. Blythe brokenly. She had not called him  that for many years--not since the day he had rebelled against it.  \"Oh--no--no--Little Jem.\"    \"I must, mother. I'm right--am I not, father?\" said Jem.    Dr. Blythe had risen. He was very pale, too, and his voice was husky.  But he did not hesitate.    \"Yes, Jem, yes--if you feel that way, yes--\"    Mrs. Blythe covered her face. Walter stared moodily at his plate. Nan  and Di clasped each others' hands. Shirley tried to look unconcerned.  Susan sat as if paralysed, her piece of pie half-eaten on her plate.  Susan never did finish that piece of pie--a fact which bore eloquent  testimony to the upheaval in her inner woman for Susan considered it a  cardinal offence against civilized society to begin to eat anything and  not finish it. That was wilful waste, hens to the contrary  notwithstanding.    Jem turned to the phone again. \"I must ring the manse. Jerry will want  to go, too.\"    At this Nan had cried out \"Oh!\" as if a knife had been thrust into her,  and rushed from the room. Di followed her. Rilla turned to Walter for  comfort but Walter was lost to her in some reverie she could not share.    \"All right,\" Jem was saying, as coolly as if he were arranging the  details of a picnic. \"I thought you would--yes, tonight--the seven  o'clock--meet me at the station. So long.\"    \"Mrs. Dr. dear,\" said Susan. \"I wish you would wake me up. Am I  dreaming--or am I awake? Does that blessed boy realize what he is  saying? Does he mean that he is going to enlist as a soldier? You do  not mean to tell me that they want children like him! It is an outrage.  Surely you and the doctor will not permit it.\"    \"We can't stop him,\" said Mrs. Blythe, chokingly. \"Oh, Gilbert!\"    Dr. Blythe came up behind his wife and took her hand gently, looking  down into the sweet grey eyes that he had only once before seen filled  with such imploring anguish as now. They both thought of that other  time--the day years ago in the House of Dreams when little Joyce had  died.    \"Would you have him stay, Anne--when the others are going--when he  thinks it his duty--would you have him so selfish and small-souled?\"    \"No--no! But--oh--our first-born son--he's only a lad--Gilbert--I'll  try to be brave after a while--just now I can't. It's all come so  suddenly. Give me time.\"    The doctor and his wife went out of the room. Jem had gone--Walter had  gone--Shirley got up to go. Rilla and Susan remained staring at each  other across the deserted table. Rilla had not yet cried--she was too  stunned for tears. Then she saw that Susan was crying--Susan, whom she  had never seen shed a tear before.    \"Oh, Susan, will he really go?\" she asked.    \"It--it--it is just ridiculous, that is what it is,\" said Susan.    She wiped away her tears, gulped resolutely and got up.    \"I am going to wash the dishes. That has to be done, even if everybody  has gone crazy. There now, dearie, do not you cry. Jem will go, most  likely--but the war will be over long before he gets anywhere near it.  Let us take a brace and not worry your poor mother.\"    \"In the Enterprise today it was reported that Lord Kitchener says the  war will last three years,\" said Rilla dubiously.    \"I am not acquainted with Lord Kitchener,\" said Susan, composedly, \"but  I dare say he makes mistakes as often as other people. Your father says  it will be over in a few months and I have as much faith in his opinion  as I have in Lord Anybody's. So just let us be calm and trust in the  Almighty and get this place tidied up. I am done with crying which is a  waste of time and discourages everybody.\"    Jem and Jerry went to Charlottetown that night and two days later they  came back in khaki. The Glen hummed with excitement over it. Life at  Ingleside had suddenly become a tense, strained, thrilling thing. Mrs.  Blythe and Nan were brave and smiling and wonderful. Already Mrs.  Blythe"]]]
