They will not allow, with impunity, their       wives and daughters to be kidnapped, dishonored, and defiled;       nor submit to laws made by such a people, nor allow themselves       to be ruled by men who practise and uphold vices and crimes so       revolting to the moral sense of the world; and if the Mormons       persist in their present course, blood will flow.         \"The only loyal people of Utah are oppressed, annoyed, and       scandalized, by a government intended by Congress to secure       them in their rights, and to protect them in their property;       and while the present Territorial organization exists, the       Mormons, who have control of the Legislature, will never 'let       up on the gentiles.'         \"The only remedy for this unnatural war, now raging between       the Mormons and the Anti-Mormons in Utah, is to be found in       the immediate separation of these people under two distinct       governmental organizations. One thing is inevitable,--the       Mormons and Anti-Mormons will never, and can never live       together in peace, under one government. The conflicts which       took place between them in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa,       and which are now going on in Utah, ought to convince any       intelligent man of the justice and truth of this declaration.       Indeed, the Mormons themselves acknowledge it; and so long as       they adhere to their belief,--a belief founded upon their own       scriptures,--that an absolute theocracy is the only government       under which they can and should live, they never will be loyal       to our government and countrymen, and hence their hostility to       our institutions and people, and their inflexible devotion to       their own.         \"In every State where the Mormons have lived, it has cost the       loyal people of the State thousands of dollars, as well as the       loss of many lives, to compel them to obey the laws. In every       instance they have resisted our laws, and in every State       necessity demanded their expulsion.         \"In Utah, while they were charged with the administration of       the government and execution of the laws, they proved       themselves not only traitors to our people, but treacherous to       the government, and openly rebelled against them and defied       their authority, and it cost the Federal Government millions       to conquer them. They have still control of the Territory, and       they are inflexibly bent upon subduing the Anti-Mormons of       Western Utah; and if the latter are not separated from them,       and protected by law, it will require the expenditure of       millions more to restore order in Utah. Congress can count the       cost in this matter, while we will have the melancholy duty of       burying our dead. The people of Nevada will never be       conquered,--never be ruled by the Mormons. Come what will,       they will resist to the bitter end. They prefer death to       dishonor, and the government may choose which of these shall       be meted out to them.         \"In addition to the above considerations, which should, I       believe, present conclusive and imposing evidence,       sufficiently satisfactory to induce Congress to organize the       Territory of Nevada, I may likewise mention others.         \"While the people of Western Utah have, in the Mormons, open       and avowed enemies, they have likewise the savage tribes to       defend themselves against. Some of these tribes are professed       Mormons, while others are under their influence. Many       conflicts have taken place between the Christians and some of       these tribes, as well as between the emigrants, while crossing       the Plains to the North Pacific, and the aforesaid savages;       and there is no hope of establishing amicable relations with       these Indian tribes, until they are brought under other and       better relations with the Anti-Mormons of Utah. Peace does not       reign in Utah, and never will, under the present order of       things. . . . .         \"When our common country shall call forth her sons to defend       her rights, the people of Nevada will come forth. They will be       ready and willing to meet the enemy, on the beach and on the       frontier, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other.       They will dispute every inch of ground, burn every blade of       grass, and the last intrenchment of liberty will become their       graves, rather than permit a foreign enemy to contaminate the       soil of our country. Can this be said of the Mormons? I think       not. If we can protect our countrymen abroad, why should we       not, on our own soil?         \"Very respectfully, yours,         \"JAMES M. CRANE,         \"_Delegate elect from Nevada_.         \"To Hon. Wm. Smith.\"                *       *       *       *       *         \"Having read the above statement of Judge Crane, delegate from       the proposed Territory of Nevada, I will state from my own       observation, having resided in the Territory of Utah for over       three years, for a portion of which time I was in Carson       Valley, that I heartily concur with him, and fully indorse his       statement in relation to the condition of things in Western       Utah, and seriously believe that the wants and necessities of       the people of that portion of the Territory demand its       immediate organization.         \"GEORGE P. STILES,         \"_Late Associate Justice for Utah_.\"    Nevada was erected into a Territory, and has made rapid and gigantic  strides in all the essentials of a high civilization. Her mines are  celebrated throughout the world, and she annually adds millions of  dollars to the circulation of the country.    Already are her valleys teeming with the life of the husbandman, and her  soil yielding up its rich harvests of golden grain, for the sustenance  of her brave and patriotic sons. She has sent several hundred men into  the field, and with unshaken loyalty stands ready to send more, if the  cause of her country calls,--thus literally fulfilling the promise of  Judge Crane made in the foregoing letter. Mark the contrast between  loyal and Christian Nevada, and disloyal and Mohammedan Utah! One  rushing on to a glorious and happy destiny, and the other falling  rapidly back into the habits and customs of heathen nations. The genius  of Liberty sits enthroned among the mountains of free Nevada, while  despotism of the most hideous character clanks her chains in Utah. May  the day of deliverance for the oppressed thousands of Utah soon dawn.  Then will she take her place among her sisters in the family of States,  and the hand of oppression be no more felt in all her fair borders.    When Brigham Young found that the gentile element was gaining ground  rapidly in Carson County, his Legislature attached it to Great Salt Lake  County, for judicial and other purposes. A large number of Mormons were  sent on to colonize, and if possible to retain, the fertile Valley of  Nevada. These missionaries were recalled in 1857, as well as many  others, who were settling in different parts of California.    Slowly and sullenly they relinquished their hold upon this rich and  prosperous portion of the Republic. It rapidly advanced in population,  and not only prospered as a Territory, as already mentioned, but has  lately been admitted as one of the States of the Union. The admission of  Nevada, carved out of Utah, while the mother Territory still remains out  in the cold, ought to be a sufficient hint that Congress and the people  of the United States are not yet prepared for the establishment in their  midst of a polygamic monarchy.    Judge Stiles returned to Salt Lake City, and there held several courts.    In the fall of 1856 a conflict arose, in regard to the jurisdiction of  the United States Marshal. Heretofore this officer had acted with the  Mormons, and all had passed off smoothly. But a real gentile was now  appointed, and this was the signal for Mormon opposition. The Mormons  claimed that the Territorial Marshal, instead of the United States  Marshal, should act in the United States courts when doing territorial  business. The United States Marshal contended that he should officiate  in all business transacted in the United States courts, whether sitting  as federal or territorial courts. Judge Stiles issued certain writs,  directed to the officer, which he found it impossible to serve. The  people, instigated by the Mormon leaders, refused to obey the precepts  of the court, and set at naught its authority, proclaiming that the  time had come when their laws, and none others, should be enforced in  Utah.    The question of jurisdiction was brought before the court, and James  Ferguson, Hosea Stout, and J. C. Little, Mormon lawyers, loudly demanded  that the Judge should decide in their favor. Ferguson, backed by an  armed mob, told Judge Stiles, in open court, that if he dared to decide  contrary to their wishes, he \"would take him from the bench d--d quick\";  that the boys were there to do it, and he, with others, by threats and  intimidations, finally compelled the Judge to adjourn his court.    Judge Stiles then appealed to Brigham Young, as Governor of the  Territory, to sustain him, and protect him in the discharge of his  duties. In reply, he was coolly told that \"the courts had already cost  him [Brigham] too much trouble; that the boys had got their spunk up,  and he would not interfere.\" He advised him, \"if he could not sustain  and enforce their [the United States] laws and institutions, the sooner  he adjourned his court the better.\"    These proceedings had a tendency to bring the Judge into disrepute with  the Mormons. Thomas Williams, a lawyer, had his office with Judge  Stiles, on Main Street. Williams, though a Mormon, was an independent  man, and had openly opposed Brigham on some question of politics.

Life in Nottingham was varied pleasantly by burglaries carried out with  the help of information supplied by Mrs. Adamson. In the June of 1877  Peace was nearly detected in stealing, at the request of that worthy,  some blankets, but by flourishing his revolver he contrived to get  away, and, soon after, returned for a season to Hull. Here this hunted  murderer, with L100 reward on his head, took rooms for Mrs. Thompson and  himself at the house of a sergeant of police. One day Mrs. Peace, who  was still keeping her shop in Hull, received a pencilled note saying, \"I  am waiting to see you just up Anlaby Road.\" She and her stepson, Willie  Ward, went to the appointed spot, and there to their astonishment stood  her husband, a distinguished figure in black coat and trousers, top  hat, velvet waistcoat, with stick, kid gloves, and a pretty little fox  terrier by his side. Peace told them of his whereabouts in the town, but  did not disclose to them the fact that his mistress was there also. To  the police sergeant with whom he lodged, Peace described himself as  an agent. But a number of sensational and successful burglaries at  the houses of Town Councillors and other well-to-do citizens of Hull  revealed the presence in their midst of no ordinary robber. Peace had  some narrow escapes, but with the help of his revolver, and on one  occasion the pusillanimity of a policeman, he succeeded in getting away  in safety. The bills offering a reward for his capture were still to  be seen in the shop windows of Hull, so after a brief but brilliant  adventure Peace and Mrs. Thompson returned to Nottingham.    Here, as the result of further successful exploits, Peace found a reward  of L50 offered for his capture. On one occasion the detectives came  into the room where Peace and his mistress were in bed. After politely  expressing his surprise at seeing \"Mrs. Bailey\" in such a situation,  one of the officers asked Peace his name. He gave it as John Ward, and  described himself as a hawker of spectacles. He refused to get up and  dress in the presence of the detectives who were obliging enough to go  downstairs and wait his convenience. Peace seized the opportunity to  slip out of the house and get away to another part of the town. From  there he sent a note to Mrs. Thompson insisting on her joining him.  He soon after left Nottingham, paid another brief visit to Hull, but  finding that his wife's shop was still frequented by the police, whom he  designated freely as \"a lot of fools,\" determined to quit the North for  good and begin life afresh in the ampler and safer field of London.      II    PEACE IN LONDON      Peace's career in London extended over nearly two years, but they were  years of copious achievement. In that comparatively short space of time,  by the exercise of that art, to his natural gifts for which he had now  added the wholesome tonic of experience, Peace passed from a poor and  obscure lodging in a slum in Lambeth to the state and opulence of a  comfortable suburban residence in Peckham. These were the halcyon days  of Peace's enterprise in life. From No. 25 Stangate Street, Lambeth, the  dealer in musical instruments, as Peace now described himself, sallied  forth night after night, and in Camberwell and other parts of South  London reaped the reward of skill and vigilance in entering other  people's houses and carrying off their property. Though in the beginning  there appeared to be but few musical instruments in Stangate Street to  justify his reputed business, \"Mr. Thompson,\" as he now called himself,  explained that he was not wholly dependent on his business, as Mrs.  Thompson \"had money.\"    So successful did the business prove that at the Christmas of 1877 Peace  invited his daughter and her betrothed to come from Hull and spend  the festive season with him. This, in spite of the presence of Mrs.  Thompson, they consented to do. Peace, in a top hat and grey ulster,  showed them the sights of London, always inquiring politely of a  policeman if he found himself in any difficulty. At the end of the visit  Peace gave his consent to his daughter's marriage with Mr. Bolsover,  and before parting gave the young couple some excellent advice. For more  reasons than one Peace was anxious to unite under the same roof Mrs.  Peace and Mrs. Thompson. Things still prospering, Peace found himself  able to remove from Lambeth to Crane Court, Greenwich, and before long  to take a couple of adjoining houses in Billingsgate Street in the  same district. These he furnished in style. In one he lived with Mrs.  Thompson, while Mrs. Peace and her son, Willie, were persuaded after  some difficulty to leave Hull and come to London to dwell in the other.    But Greenwich was not to the taste of Mrs. Thompson. To gratify her  wish, Peace, some time in May, 1877, removed the whole party to a house,  No. 5, East Terrace, Evelina Road, Peckham. He paid thirty pounds a year  for it, and obtained permission to build a stable for his pony and trap.  When asked for his references, Peace replied by inviting the agent to  dine with him at his house in Greenwich, a proceeding that seems to have  removed all doubt from the agent's mind as to the desirability of the  tenant.    This now famous house in Peckham was of the ordinary type of suburban  villa, with basement, ground floor, and one above; there were steps up  to the front door, and a bow window to the front sitting-room. A garden  at the back of the house ran down to the Chatham and Dover railway line.  It was by an entrance at the back that Peace drove his horse and trap  into the stable which he had erected in the garden. Though all living  in the same house, Mrs. Peace, who passed as Mrs. Ward, and her son,  Willie, inhabited the basement, while Peace and Mrs. Thompson occupied  the best rooms on the ground floor. The house was fitted with Venetian  blinds. In the drawing-room stood a good walnut suite of furniture; a  Turkey carpet, gilded mirrors, a piano, an inlaid Spanish guitar, and,  by the side of an elegant table, the beaded slippers of the good  master of the house completed the elegance of the apartment. Everything  confirmed Mr. Thompson's description of himself as a gentleman of  independent means with a taste for scientific inventions. In association  with a person of the name of Brion, Peace did, as a fact, patent an  invention for raising sunken vessels, and it is said that in pursuing  their project, the two men had obtained an interview with Mr. Plimsoll  at the House of Commons. In any case, the Patent Gazette records the  following grant:      \"2635 Henry Fersey Brion, 22 Philip Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E., and  John Thompson, 5 East Terrace, Evelina Road, Peckham Rye, London, S.E.,  for an invention for raising sunken vessels by the displacement of water  within the vessels by air and gases.\"      At the time of his final capture Peace was engaged on other inventions,  among them a smoke helmet for firemen, an improved brush for washing  railway carriages, and a form of hydraulic tank. To the anxious  policeman who, seeing a light in Mr. Thompson's house in the small hours  of the morning, rang the bell to warn the old gentleman of the possible  presence of burglars, this business of scientific inventions was  sufficient explanation.    Socially Mr. Thompson became quite a figure in the neighbourhood. He  attended regularly the Sunday evening services at the parish church, and  it must have been a matter of anxious concern to dear Mr. Thompson that  during his stay in Peckham the vicarage was broken into by a burglar and  an unsuccessful attempt made to steal the communion plate which was kept  there.    Mr. Thompson was generous in giving and punctual in paying. He had his  eccentricities. His love of birds and animals was remarkable. Cats,  dogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs, canaries, parrots and cockatoos all found  hospitality under his roof. It was certainly eccentricity in Mr.  Thompson that he should wear different coloured wigs; and that his dark  complexion should suggest the use of walnut juice. His love of music was  evinced by the number of violins, banjoes, guitars, and other musical  instruments that adorned his drawing-room. Tea and music formed the  staple of the evening entertainments which Mr. and Mrs. Thompson would  give occasionally to friendly neighbours. Not that the pleasures of  conversation were neglected wholly in favour of art. The host was  a voluble and animated talker, his face and body illustrating  by appropriate twists and turns the force of his comments. The  Russo-Turkish war, then raging, was a favourite theme of Mr. Thompson's.  He asked, as we are still asking, what Christianity and civilisation  mean by countenancing the horrors of war. He considered the British  Government in the highest degree guilty in supporting the cruel Turks, a  people whose sobriety seemed to him to be their only virtue, against  the Christian Russians. He was confident that our Ministers would be  punished for opposing the only Power which had shown any sympathy with  suffering races. About ten o'clock Mr. Thompson, whose health, he said,  could not stand late hours, would bid his guests good night, and by  half-past ten the front door of No. 5, East Terrace, Evelina Road, would  be locked and bolted, and the house plunged in darkness.    Not that it must be supposed that family life at No. 5, East Terrace,  was without its jars. These were due chiefly to the drunken habits of  Mrs. Thompson. Peace was willing to overlook his mistress' failing  as long as it was confined to the house. But Mrs. Thompson had an  unfortunate habit of slipping out in an intoxicated condition, and  chattering with the neighbours. As she was the repository of many a  dangerous secret the inconvenience of her "]]]
