During  our stay a lump of gold was discovered in the Western district weighing  150 lbs., and worth L6000. Such instances of good fortune only tend to  raise fallacious hopes of being equally fortunate in the breasts of  thousands of men. Shortly before our arrival, on the news being  promulgated of the new Eldorado in the north near Port Curtis on the  Fitzroy, not less than 16,000 men flocked thither from New South Wales  and Victoria. This enormous influx of human beings to a district totally  unprovided with either shelter or provisions for such a horde resulted in  unutterable suffering. People had sold their goods in Sydney for whatever  they would fetch, in order to be the first in the gold-field with the  requisite implements. Many lost their entire means of support, having even  sacrificed the most favourable prospects in the eager thirst for gold and  sudden prosperity. The streets of Melbourne and Sydney were filled with  gold-seekers, who, laden with blankets, household utensils, axes, and  spades, were laying down their last farthing for passage tickets, and  rushed breathlessly to the ships which were to convey them to the  newly-discovered gold-field. The voyage began under the most rose-coloured  anticipations of brilliant success. But scarcely a month later came most  depressing intelligence from Port Curtis. Here was a set of lawless  desperadoes, deceived in their expectations, without food, clothing, or  even the object of their search, in a remote part of the country, with the  hot season coming on, and no means of returning! Men were seen selling for  a few shillings implements that had cost pounds. The whole road from the  supposed gold-fields to the landing-quay was strewed with diggers, who,  footsore and fainting under the heat, were toiling towards the coast,  where they rushed in wild confusion on board the ships which were to  convey the victims back to the colonies they had left at so much sacrifice  and with so extravagant expectations!    It was only the energetic measures taken by Government, by whom provisions  were forthwith despatched to the wretched make-shifts of settlements  improvised on the spur of the moment, and gave numbers free passages to  Sydney and Melbourne, that prevented some serious disaster. A few months  later the place so suddenly populous had become once more a despised  solitude, and Rockhampton had resumed its wonted state of a hamlet  consisting of two or three houses. In Sydney, however, the famished crowd  seeking after work kept wandering about, thankfully accepting the soup  which the charity of their fellow-citizens supplied free of charge.    During these various excursions of the scientific staff, the frigate had,  thanks to the kindness of H.E. Sir Wm. Denison, been taken into the  Government dry dock at Cockatoo Island in order to facilitate her  extensive repairs. The _Novara_ was, as the chief engineer himself  allowed, the largest man-of-war which had ever been docked, not merely in  Port Jackson, but anywhere in the Eastern hemisphere.    The Fitzroy dry dock, which had not long been completed, is 300 feet in  length (since lengthened another 100 feet), 60 feet wide, and will  accommodate vessels drawing 19 feet water. In preparing this splendid  structure, which took eight years to complete, a huge rock 50 feet high  was first blasted, the excavation began on the land-side, and on its  completion a gate opened towards the sea. All being right thus far, a  subaqueous mine was sprung by means of large diving-bells, the  excavations being charged with two or three lbs. of powder. A steam-engine  of 40-horse power pumps the dock dry,[18] besides being geared to set in  motion the various machinery in the shops, such as lathes, iron planes,  &c. The dock gates are iron-plated. Although constructed entirely by  convict labour, the expense was enormous, since to overcome the  extraordinary difficulty presented by the soil, the entire machinery, down  to the very smallest tool, had to be imported from England.    The frigate lay about a week in dock. Besides the usual handicraftsmen  there were upwards of thirty caulkers employed, each of whom was paid  14_s._ per diem, net, but the entire cost was 17_s._ a day, as each man  was conveyed to and fro, morning and evening, at Government expense. But  as provisions are high, the workman can save by the end of the week little  if at all more than the English labourer who does not receive one-third of  his wages. At present there are on the island 360 prisoners, all such as  have been sentenced to ten years penal servitude at least. This  establishment was, however, to be broken up, and the convicts distributed  among other prisons, so soon as the dock was quite completed.    The main features of a prison reform, contemplated by Sir Wm. Denison,  with the praiseworthy object not merely of prevention of crime, but of  ameliorating the moral condition of the criminal, consisted in the  classification of criminals according to the nature of their  crime--co-operative labour during the day, solitary confinement at night,  and a certain amount of remuneration for work performed, so as to  stimulate to habits of industry by a visible reward, and a scale of  dietary barely sufficient to maintain life, any additional delicacy being  paid for out of the man's own earnings, yet not so as to entirely exhaust  his wages, the balance of which thus went on accumulating, so as to give  him a small sum of money in hand, when, his sentence expired, he was set  at liberty with, it is to be hoped, freshly-acquired habits of industry.  To facilitate this benevolent plan, Sir William bethought him of erecting  the prisons in the neighbourhood of Sydney, where there is more of a  market for convict labour, and recommended the construction of roads. The  number of prisoners at present in New South Wales is about 1260, whose  support costs on an average L36,000 per annum. In order to adapt to the  existing prisons the new system put in operation by the late  Governor-general, and extend it to 1600 men,[19] there would be required a  further outlay of L69,000, but one-third of the present annual outlay for  sustenance would be saved.    On 25th November the _Novara_, thoroughly overhauled and rejuvenated,  returned to her former anchorage near Garden Island, and the following day  commenced a series of festivities, which the German residents at Sydney  had got up to welcome the Imperial Expedition, commencing with a  serenade, given by the German Singing-Club, who hired a large steamer, the  _Washington_, for the occasion, which they had gaily decorated with  foliage and coloured lamps. Amidships there was a splendid transparency,  with the word \"Welcome\" inscribed in letters of light, above which was a  very neatly executed Austrian eagle. Upwards of 300 guests shared in the  fete. At 8 P.M. the vessel got under weigh from Circular Quay. With the  first plash of the paddles the music struck up, and the ship glided off,  as though on the wings of Harmony, towards the grand-looking _Novara_.    Unfortunately the weather proved very unfavourable. To an oppressingly  hot, close, sultry day of entire calm, the thermometer marking 109 deg. Fahr.  in shade, there had suddenly sprung up a \"Brickfielder,\"[20] that dreaded  south wind, which may be considered one of the worst plagues of Sydney,  owing to the clouds of dust. It now put German patience and German  good-humour to a severe proof. At each tack of the steamer it blew out a  whole row of variegated lamps and illuminations, which, however, were as  perseveringly relit. It had been firmly resolved, however, to let nothing  mar the success of the festival, and the old indomitable German \"pluck\"  came out victorious in its contest with the \"Brickfielder.\" Amid the full  clangour of the bands of music were heard shouts of jubilant mirth,  mingled with the howling and whistling of the wind, and the rush and roar  of rockets, while the occasional firing of Bengal lights shed their magic  effect over the parti-coloured crowd on board, the ships in harbour, and  the agitated waters below. At last the steamer got near the frigate, which  she swept round in a wide graceful curve, and dropped anchor at a little  distance away. At that moment a considerable number of port-fires were lit  on board the _Novara_, bathing the entire scene, including the stately  ship herself, in an absolute deluge of light, guided by which a number of  boats put off with the company, who despite the weather were all enabled  in safety to gratify their curiosity as to the effect of nocturnal  festivities.    One of the frigate's boats was manned and despatched to the steamer, to  bring on board the _Novara_ the committee who had been entrusted with the  presentation of an address.    On board the _Novara_ the utmost excitement prevailed, almost all the  officers and petty and warrant officers being on deck, the band playing  nothing but German music. The evening ended as it began, with music and  melody, such a thoroughly German welcome making a profound impression upon  the English of Sydney.    The following day the German clubs of Sydney invited the staff to a  ceremonial banquet, the saloon in which dinner was served being elegantly  decorated with the flags of the various German states, between which were  excellent likenesses of the Emperor and Empress. Upwards of seventy guests  sat down to a sumptuous repast, after which free flow was given to the  expression of the warmest wishes for fatherland and the German nation.    While these festivities were going on, the English mails brought the  intelligence of the birth of an heir to the throne! So signal a cause for  thankfulness on the part of Austria was duly observed at the uttermost  ends of the earth, and on 27th November the thunder of the _Novara's_  cannon announced the glad tidings to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24. [New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#9)"],[1,", and he adds, \"Up to this hour I have never received one  shilling or any kind of acknowledgment whatever from the British  Government.\" It is notorious, adds the editor, that some of the most  renowned and invaluable inventions of recent years, especially those  connected with the navy, have narrowly escaped rejection by permanent  but ignorant officials; and that the authors of the inventions have  had to submit to delay, loss, annoyance, and contumely before their  processes could be tried, even after their success had been officially  demonstrated. Perhaps it is not now so much a question of money,  for it is to be hoped that Mr. Bessemer is reaping the due reward  of ingenuity and skill in other fields of invention. But even his  discoveries in steel making, if they have very properly enriched  himself, have, in an infinitely larger degree, added to the wealth of  the country, and have given employment to many thousands. Such a man  is a public benefactor, and eminently deserves recognition by  the state, especially by way of atonement for former neglect and  injustice. Military men receive titular honors and a pecuniary reward  for slaying a crowd of savages and burning their huts, while the  men who have helped to make England what she is, commercially and  industrially, are in most cases left to their fate, which may chance  to be pecuniary ruin.           *       *       *       *       *          OIL NOTES.    PENNSYLVANIA.      The total production of crude petroleum for the first three quarters  of 1878 was 11,126,037 barrels, against 8,436,867 barrels for the same  time in 1877; increase in 1878, 1,689,170 barrels.    The total number of drilling wells completed for the first three  quarters of 1878 were 2,333, against 2,699 for the same time in 1877;  decrease in 1878, 366.    The daily average production of the new wells completed for the first  three quarters of 1878 was 13 2-10 barrels, against 14 2-10 for the  same time in 1877; decrease in 1878, 1 barrel.    The total number of dry holes developed in the first three quarters  of 1878 were 280, against 476 for the same time in 1877; decrease in  1878, 196.    The total amount of crude petroleum held in the producing regions of  Pennsvlvania, at the close of the third quarter of 1878, was 4,599,362  barrels, against 2,503,657 at the same time in 1877; increase in 1878,  2,095,705 barrels.    The amount of crude petroleum represented by outstanding certificates  on the last day of September was 1,705,853 barrels, against 1,317,484  barrels on the last day of October, a reduction during October of  158,127 barrels.    Mr. J. M. Guffey has purchased of Marcus Hulings an undivided half  interest in the celebrated Kinzua Creek property (Bradford district).  The purchased portion contains 6,400 acres, on which there is a well  that was struck in June last, and since that time has been doing from  16 to 18 barrels, and has never been torpedoed. Mr. Guffey looks upon  this as one of the best prospective oil territories in the country.    D. W. C. Carroll & Co., of Pittsburg, have kept from 45 to 75 men  employed, since June, in the oil regions, building iron tanks, nearly  all of which are located in the Bradford district.      WEST VIRGINIA.    The Wheeling _Intelligencer_ says: As noticed in our Moundsville  letter this morning, extensive preparations have been made to bore for  oil on the opposite side of the river at the Union Coal Works shaft.  The machinery was brought down from Pittsburg on Tuesday, and is now  being put in position by contractors, who have engaged to go down  1,200 feet. It will be recollected that for a long time past oil has  been found in the coal shaft, and the company who are putting down the  well feel confident that plenty of it exists deeper down. Some parties  look forward to the development of the fact that Moundsville is  situated in an important oil break, and that oil in abundance will  be found on both sides of the river. The progress of the well will be  looked forward to with much interest by the people of that vicinity.      MASSACHUSETTS.    The Maverick Oil Works at East Boston have recently made some very  extensive additions and improvements, lengthening their wharf and  making a variety of alterations in their buildings. They will shortly  complete a new cooper shop, wherein, it is probable, they will  construct all the tin cans required by the demands of their business.      OHIO.    The oil excitement has broken out afresh in West Mecca, Warren county,  Ohio. Oil men, heavily backed with capital, have recently come in from  Pennsylvania, and are making things lively in that locality. Eight new  wells have been put in operation during the past week. This district  is the same where the principal excitement prevailed 18 years ago.      JAPAN.    The Tokio _Times_ states that the principal feature of American trade  with Japan is the petroleum exports from New York. The enterprise was  inaugurated only eight years ago; but the business has so increased  that while only 200 cases of kerosene, valued at $600, were exported  in 1870, in 1877 366,639 cases were sent to Yokohama, and 128,158  cases to Hiogo, whither none had before been carried direct. The value  of these consignments was over $1,000,000.    Several refineries are in operation in Japan, making kerosene from  native petroleum.      RUSSIA.    The recent reports concerning the discovery of oil near the shores of  the Caspian Sea seem to be fully confirmed. From one of the wells a  stream, free from gas and froth, is forced to a height of 75 feet,  yielding at the rate of 10,000 barrels a day. It is reported that  companies are forming at Odessa, Kovo-Tcherkask, Astrakhan, and other  cities, for the purpose of obtaining oil. Two large manufacturing  concerns, who have their headquarters in New York city, recently  received orders for considerable quantities of oil-line pipes,  steam pumps, engines, boilers, and other apparatus, to be shipped  immediately for St. Petersburg, Russia.      ITALY.    The oil wells of Italy comprise about 5, with a capacity of about 30  barrels per day, of a thick substance of 14 gravity. They are pumped  by hand, which, though primitive, is cheaper than steam, for both men  and women are employed, the former receiving as compensation for a  day's work 1 lira, equal to 20 cents; and the women 60 centessimi,  equal to 12 cents of our money. The wells are located in a deep  valley, and the oil carried up on the backs of donkeys to a refinery,  where it is treated, and yields from 2 to 5 per cent. of burning oil.      PERU.    It is proposed to build a pipe line from the refinery on the estates  of Henry Meiggs to the shipping port, a distance of about 7 miles. It  is stated that oil can be produced at this point for less than 1 cent  a gallon, and as the fields have produced from time immemorial, there  is no prospect of their early exhaustion.      ONTARIO.    The oil refinery at St. Thomas, Ont., is running day and night; 494  barrels of crude petroleum were brought from Petrolia for it in one  week recently.--_Stowell's Petroleum Reporter_.           *       *       *       *       *          RAILWAY NOTES.      The new track laid in this country during the year ending September  10, 1878, was 1,160 miles. During the six preceding years the number  of miles of track laid was: In 1872, 4,498; 1873, 2,455; 1874, 1,066;  1875, 702; 1876, 1,467; 1877, 1,176.    The statement made in the recent Narrow Gauge Convention, that  standard gauge freight cars weigh ten tons and carry ten tons, is  indignantly disputed by users of the latter. One gentleman, having  much to do with freight cars, says that the modern freight cars weigh  from 17,000 to 18,000 lbs., commonly carry (and that on long hauls)  28,000 lbs., are guaranteed to carry 30,000 lbs., while he has seen  them show on the scales 30,000 and 32,000 lbs. of load, and in one  case 35,000 lbs. The general tendency for some years has been to  increase loads without increasing, but in many cases decreasing,  weights of cars; and it seems quite likely that 30,000 lbs. will soon  be the standard load. The tank cars used for carrying petroleum have  an average capacity--and they are almost always run full--of 30,000  lbs. The Standard Oil Company, which has some 3,000 of such cars,  carried on four-wheeled trucks with the Master Car Builders' standard  axle, has run them with such loads for years, and only recently had  its first case of a broken axle, manifestly due to a defect in the  iron.    INTERESTING observations have been made recently on the Cologne-Minden  Road, Prussia, on the rusting of iron rails. A pile of rails of odd  lengths were laid on sleepers over a bed of gravel early in 1870, and  remained undisturbed until the fall of 1877, there being no use for  them. It was then found that they were covered with a layer of rust  0.12 inch thick, which had to be removed by striking the rail with a  hammer. The cleaned rail weighed only 398.2 lbs., while its original  weight was 419.1 lbs., showing that 5 per cent. of the rail had been  destroyed by rust, which covered the rail quite uniformly. This  confirms the observation often made, that rails stacked away are much  more liable to rust than those laid down in a track.    According to _Le Fer_, at a meeting of directors of the German  railroads held at Constance, the following information was furnished  in regard to the relative value of the different methods of injecting  ties:    1. Railroad from Hanover and Cologne to Minden. Pine ties injected  with chloride of zinc; after 21 years the proportion of ties renewed  was 21 per cent. Beech ties injected with creasote; after 22 years,  46 per cent. Oak ties injected with chloride of zinc; after 17 years,  20.7 per cent. Oak ties not injected; after 17 years, 49 per cent. The  conditions were very favorable for experiment; the road bed was good,  and permitted of"]]]
