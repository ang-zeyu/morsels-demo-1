They exhibit, however, one of the most remarkable  evidences of the globular shape of our earth; for the outline of its  shadow when seen creeping over the moon's surface is always circular.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Total and Partial Eclipses of the Moon. The Moon  is here shown in two positions; i.e. _entirely_ plunged in the earth's  shadow and therefore totally eclipsed, and only _partly_ plunged in it  or partially eclipsed.]    _Eclipses of the Moon_, or Lunar Eclipses, as they are also called, are  of two kinds--_Total_, and _Partial_. In a total lunar eclipse the moon  passes entirely into the earth's shadow, and the whole of her surface is  consequently darkened. This darkening lasts for about two hours. In a  partial lunar eclipse, a portion only of the moon passes through the  shadow, and so only _part_ of her surface is darkened (see Fig. 3). A  very striking phenomenon during a total eclipse of the moon, is that the  darkening of the lunar surface is usually by no means so intense as one  would expect, when one considers that the sunlight at that time should  be _wholly_ cut off from it. The occasions indeed upon which the moon  has completely disappeared from view during the progress of a total  lunar eclipse are very rare. On the majority of these occasions she has  appeared of a coppery-red colour, while sometimes she has assumed an  ashen hue. The explanations of these variations of colour is to be found  in the then state of the atmosphere which surrounds our earth. When  those portions of our earth's atmosphere through which the sun's rays  have to filter on their way towards the moon are free from watery  vapour, the lunar surface will be tinged with a reddish light, such as  we ordinarily experience at sunset when our air is dry. The ashen colour  is the result of our atmosphere being laden with watery vapour, and is  similar to what we see at sunset when rain is about. Lastly, when the  air around the earth is thickly charged with cloud, no light at all can  pass; and on such occasions the moon disappears altogether for the time  being from the night sky.    _Eclipses of the Sun_, otherwise known as Solar Eclipses, are divided  into _Total_, _Partial_, and _Annular_. A total eclipse of the sun takes  place when the moon comes between the sun and the earth, in such a  manner that it cuts off the sunlight _entirely_ for the time being from  a _portion_ of the earth's surface. A person situated in the region in  question will, therefore, at that moment find the sun temporarily  blotted out from his view by the body of the moon. Since the moon is a  very much smaller body than the sun, and also very much the nearer to us  of the two, it will readily be understood that the portion of the earth  from which the sun is seen thus totally eclipsed will be of small  extent. In places not very distant from this region, the moon will  appear so much shifted in the sky that the sun will be seen only  partially eclipsed. The moon being in constant movement round the earth,  the portion of the earth's surface from which an eclipse is seen as  total will be always a comparatively narrow band lying roughly from west  to east. This band, known as the _track of totality_, can, at the  utmost, never be more than about 165 miles in width, and as a rule is  very much less. For about 2000 miles on either side of it the sun is  seen partially eclipsed. Outside these limits no eclipse of any kind is  visible, as from such regions the moon is not seen to come in the way of  the sun (see Fig. 4 (i.), p. 67).    It may occur to the reader that eclipses can also take place in the  course of which the positions, where the eclipse would ordinarily be  seen as total, will lie outside the surface of the earth. Such an  eclipse is thus not dignified with the name of total eclipse, but is  called a partial eclipse, because from the earth's surface the sun is  only seen _partly eclipsed at the utmost_ (see Fig. 4 (ii.), p. 67).    [Illustration: (i.) Total Eclipse of the Sun.]    [Illustration: (ii.) Partial Eclipse of the Sun.    FIG. 4.--Total and Partial Eclipses of the Sun. From the position A the  Sun cannot be seen, as it is entirely blotted out by the Moon. From B it  is seen partially blotted out, because the Moon is to a certain degree  in the way. From C no eclipse is seen, because the Moon does not come in  the way.    It is to be noted that in a Partial Eclipse of the Sun, the position A  lies _outside_ the surface of the Earth.]    An _Annular eclipse_ is an eclipse which just fails to become total for  yet another reason. We have pointed out that the orbits of the various  members of the solar system are not circular, but oval. Such oval  figures, it will be remembered, are technically known as ellipses. In an  elliptic orbit the controlling body is situated not in the middle of the  figure, but rather towards one of the ends; the actual point which it  occupies being known as the _focus_. The sun being at the focus of the  earth's orbit, it follows that the earth is, at times, a little nearer  to him than at others. The sun will therefore appear to us to vary a  little in size, looking sometimes slightly larger than at other times.  It is so, too, with the moon, at the focus of whose orbit the earth is  situated. She therefore also appears to us at times to vary slightly in  size. The result is that when the sun is eclipsed by the moon, and the  moon at the time appears the larger of the two, she is able to blot out  the sun completely, and so we can get a total eclipse. But when, on the  other hand, the sun appears the larger, the eclipse will not be quite  total, for a portion of the sun's disc will be seen protruding all  around the moon like a ring of light. This is what is known as an  annular eclipse, from the Latin word _annulus_, which means a ring. The  term is consecrated by long usage, but it seems an unfortunate one on  account of its similarity to the word \"annual.\" The Germans speak of  this kind of eclipse as \"ring-formed,\" which is certainly much more to  the point.    There can never be a year without an eclipse of the sun. Indeed there  must be always two such eclipses _at least_ during that period, though  there need be no eclipse of the moon at all. On the other hand, the  greatest number of eclipses which can ever take place during a year are  seven; that is to say, either five solar eclipses and two lunar, or four  solar and three lunar. This general statement refers merely to eclipses  in their broadest significance, and informs us in no way whether they  will be total or partial.    Of all the phenomena which arise from the hiding of any celestial body  by one nearer coming in the way, a total eclipse of the sun is far the  most important. It is, indeed, interesting to consider how much poorer  modern astronomy would be but for the extraordinary coincidence which  makes a total solar eclipse just possible. The sun is about 400 times  farther off from us than the moon, and enormously greater than her in  bulk. Yet the two are relatively so distanced from us as to look about  the same size. The result of this is that the moon, as has been seen,  can often blot out the sun entirely from our view for a short time. When  this takes place the great blaze of sunlight which ordinarily dazzles  our eyes is completely cut off, and we are thus enabled, unimpeded, to  note what is going on in the immediate vicinity of the sun itself.    In a total solar eclipse, the time which elapses from the moment when  the moon's disc first begins to impinge upon that of the sun at his  western edge until the eclipse becomes total, lasts about an hour.  During all this time the black lunar disc may be watched making its way  steadily across the solar face. Notwithstanding the gradual obscuration  of the sun, one does not notice much diminution of light until about  three-quarters of his disc are covered. Then a wan, unearthly appearance  begins to pervade all things, the temperature falls noticeably, and  nature seems to halt in expectation of the coming of something unusual.  The decreasing portion of sun becomes more and more narrow, until at  length it is reduced to a crescent-shaped strip of exceeding fineness.  Strange, ill-defined, flickering shadows (known as \"Shadow Bands\") may  at this moment be seen chasing each other across any white expanse such  as a wall, a building, or a sheet stretched upon the ground. The western  side of the sky has now assumed an appearance dark and lowering, as if a  rainstorm of great violence were approaching. This is caused by the  mighty mass of the lunar shadow sweeping rapidly along. It flies onward  at the terrific velocity of about half a mile a second.    If the gradually diminishing crescent of sun be now watched through a  telescope, the observer will notice that it does not eventually vanish  all at once, as he might have expected. Rather, it breaks up first of  all along its length into a series of brilliant dots, known as \"Baily's  Beads.\" The reason of this phenomenon is perhaps not entirely agreed  upon, but the majority of astronomers incline to the opinion that the  so-called \"beads\" are merely the last remnants of sunlight peeping  between those lunar mountain peaks which happen at the moment to fringe  the advancing edge of the moon. The beads are no sooner formed than they  rapidly disappear one after the other, after which no portion of the  solar surface is left to view, and the eclipse is now total (see Fig.  5).    [Illustration: _In a total Eclipse_ _In an annular Eclipse_    FIG. 5.--\"Baily's Beads.\"]    But with the disappearance of the sun there springs into view a new and  strange appearance, ordinarily unseen because of the blaze of sunlight.  It is a kind of aureole, or halo, pearly white in colour, which is seen  to surround the black disc of the moon. This white radiance is none  other than the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#9)"],[1," because of the  Holts. I am so glad we met them.\"    So we drove along, talking together; we each assured the girl of our  entire willingness to have her as a member of the family. After a  while I got on to the wagon with Mr. Stewart and told him Elizabeth's  story so that he could inquire about the man. Soon we came to the  crossing on Green River. Just beyond the ford we could see the  game-warden's cabin, with the stars and stripes fluttering gayly in  the fresh morning breeze. We drove into the roaring, dashing water,  and we held our breath until we emerged on the other side.    Mr. Sorenson is a very capable and conscientious game-warden and  a very genial gentleman. He rode down to meet us, to inspect our  license and to tell us about our privileges and our duties as good  woodsmen. He also issues licenses in case hunters have neglected to  secure them before coming. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy had refused to get a  license when we did. She said she was not going to hunt; she told us  we could give her a small piece of \"ilk\" and that would do; so we were  rather surprised when she purchased two licenses, one a special, which  would entitle her to a bull elk. As we were starting Mr. Stewart asked  the game-warden, \"Can you tell me if Wallace White is still stationed  here?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Mr. Sorenson said, \"Wallace's place is only a few  miles up the river and can be plainly seen from the road.\"    We drove on. Happiness had taken a new clutch upon my heart. I looked  back, expecting to see Elizabeth all smiles, but if you will believe  me the foolish girl was sobbing as if her heart was broken. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy drew her head down upon her shoulder and was trying to  quiet her. The road along there was _very_ rough. Staying on the  wagon occupied all my attention for a while. Several miles were passed  when we came in sight of a beautiful cabin, half hidden in a grove of  pines beyond the river. Mr. Stewart said we might as well \"noon\" as  soon as we came to a good place, and then he would ride across and see  Mr. White.    Just as we rounded the hill a horseman came toward us. A splendid  fellow he was, manly strength and grace showing in every line. The  road was narrow against the hillside and he had to ride quite close,  so I saw his handsome face plainly. As soon as he saw Elizabeth he  sprang from his saddle and said, \"'Liz'beth, 'Liz'beth, what you doin'  here?\"    She held her hands to him and said, \"Oh, just riding with friends.\"  Then to Mrs. O'Shaughnessy she said, \"_This_ is my Wallace.\"    Mr. Stewart is the queerest man: instead of letting me enjoy the  tableau, he solemnly drove on, saying he would not want any one  gawking at him if he were the happy man. Anyway, he couldn't urge  Chub fast enough to prevent my seeing and hearing what I've told you.  Besides that, I saw that Elizabeth's hat was on awry, her hair in  disorder, and her eyes red. It was disappointing after she had been so  careful to look nicely.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy came trotting along and we stopped for dinner. We  had just got the coffee boiling when the lovers came up, Elizabeth in  the saddle, \"learning to ride,\" and he walking beside her holding her  hand. How happy they were! The rest of us were mighty near as foolish  as they. They were going to start immediately after dinner, on  horseback, for the county seat, to be married. After we had eaten,  Elizabeth selected a few things from her trunk, and Mr. Stewart and  Mr. White drove the buckboard across the river to leave the trunk in  its new home. While they were gone we helped Elizabeth to dress. All  the while Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was admonishing her to name her first  \"girul\" Mary Ellen; \"or,\" she said, \"if yer first girul happens to be  a b'y, it's Sheridan ye'll be callin' him, which was me name before I  was married to me man, God rest his soul.\"    Dear Elizabeth, she was glad to get away, I suspect! She and her  Wallace made a fine couple as they rode away in the golden September  afternoon. I believe she is _one_ happy bride that the sun shone on,  if the omen has failed _everywhere_ else.    Well, we felt powerfully reduced in numbers, but about three o'clock  that afternoon we came upon Mr. Struble and Mr. Haynes waiting beside  the road for us. They had come to pilot us into camp, for there would  be no road soon.    Such a way as we came over! Such jolting and sliding! I begged to get  off and walk; but as the whole way was carpeted by strawberry vines  and there were late berries to tempt me to loiter, I had to stay on  the wagon. I had no idea a wagon could be got across such places.    Mr. Struble drove for Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, and I could hear her  imploring all the saints to preserve us from instant death. I kept  shutting my eyes, trying not to see the terrifying places, and opening  them again to see the beauty spread everywhere, until Mr. Stewart  said, \"It must make you nervous to ride over mountain roads. Don't bat  your eyes so fast and you'll see more.\" So then I stiffened my back  and kept my eyes open, and I _did_ see more.    It had been decided to go as far as we could with the wagons and then  set camp; from there the hunters would ride horseback as far up as  they could and then climb. It was almost sundown when we reached camp.  All the hunters were in, and such a yowling as they set up! \"Look  who's here! See who's come!\" they yelled. They went to work setting up  tents and unloading wagons with a hearty good-will.    We are camped just on the edge of the pines. Back of us rises a big  pine-clad mountain; our tents are set under some big trees, on a  small plateau, and right below us is a valley in which grass grows  knee high and little streams come from every way. Trout scurry up  stream whenever we go near. We call the valley Paradise Valley because  it is the horses' paradise. And as in the early morning we can often  see clouds rolling along the valley, we call our camp Cloudcrest. We  have a beautiful place: it is well sheltered; there is plenty of wood,  water, and feed; and, looking eastward down the valley, snow-covered,  crag-topped mountains delight the eye.    The air is so bracing that we all feel equal to _anything_. Mr.  Struble has already killed a fine \"spike\" elk for camp eating. We  camped in a bunch, and we have camp stoves so that in case of rain or  snow we can stay indoors. Just now we have a huge camp fire around  which we sit in the evening, telling stories, singing, and eating nuts  of the pinon pine. Then too the whole country is filled with those  tiny little strawberries. We have to gather all day to get as much as  we can eat, but they are delicious. Yesterday we had pie made of wild  currants; there are a powerful lot of them here. There is also a  little blueberry that the men say is the Rocky Mountain huckleberry.  The grouse are feeding on them. Altogether this is one of the most  delightful places imaginable. The men are not very anxious to begin  hunting. A little delay means cooler weather for the meat. It is cool  up here, but going back across the desert it will be warm for a while  yet. Still, when they see elk every day it is a great temptation to  try a shot.    One of the students told me Professor Glenholdt was here to get the  tip-end bone of the tail of a brontosaurus. I don't know what that is,  but if it is a fossil he won't get it, for the soil is too deep. The  students are jolly, likable fellows, but they can talk of nothing but  strata and formation. I heard one of them say he would be glad when  some one killed a bear, as he had heard they were fine eating, having  strata of fat alternating with strata of lean. Mr. Haynes is a quiet  fellow, just interested in hunting. Mr. Struble is the big man of the  party; he is tall and strong and we find him very pleasant company.  Then there is Dr. Teschall; he is a quiet fellow with an unexpected  smile. He is so reserved that I felt that he was kind of out of place  among the rest until I caught his cordial smile. He is so slight that  I don't see how he will stand the hard climbing, not to mention  carrying the heavy gun. They are using the largest caliber sporting  guns,--murderous-looking things. That is, all except Mr. Harkrudder,  the picture man. He looks to be about forty years old, but whoops and  laughs like he was about ten.    I don't need to tell you of the \"good mon,\" do I? He is just the kind,  quiet good mon that he has always been since I have known him. A young  lady from a neighboring camp came over and said she had called to see  our _tout ensemble_. Well, I've given you it, they, us, or we.    We didn't need a guide, as Mr. Haynes and Mr. Struble are old-timers.  We were to have had a cook, but when we reached Pinedale, where we  were to have picked him up, he told Mr. Haynes he was \"too tam seek  in de bel,\" so we had to come without him; but that is really no  inconvenience, since we are all very good cooks and are all willing  to help. I don't think I shall be able to tell you of any great  exploits I make with the gun. I fired one that Mr. Stewart carries,  and it almost kicked my shoulder off. I am mystified about Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy's license. I know she would not shoot one of those big  guns for a dozen elk; besides that, she is very tender-hearted and  will never harm anything herself, although she likes to join our  hunts.    I think you must be tired of this letter, so I am going to say  good-night, my friend.                                  E. R. S.          VII    THE HUNT                                    CAMP CLOUDCREST,                                     October 6, 1914.      DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    It seems so odd to be writing you and getting no answers. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy just now asked me what I have against you that I write  you so much. I haven't one thing. I told her I owed you more love than  I could ever pay in a lifetime, and she said writing such _long_  letters is a mighty poor way to show it. I"]]]
