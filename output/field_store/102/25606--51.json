As soon as he is down, get in and row a few hundred yards  further and repeat the same a dozen of times. The moment the dog  obeys, you must pet him so as to make him understand that what he  does is right. If you will repeat the same tactics for three or four  days, the dog will soon know how to balance himself and will be very  steady--you will never have any bother with him. Thus a dog trained  to water and canoe is a very handy thing for you as well as for the  dog. Should you have no room in the canoe, he will swim. If you have  room, just for him he will be as safe for you to take on board as a  stone. A pair of hounds so trained will just balance your canoe  right. It is a good thing to put some hay, straw or a bag in the  bottom of the boat or canoe for the dog to lie down on. They will  soon know their place to lay.    A QUICK METHOD.    Having many years of experience in the breeding and training of  hounds to hunt nearly all kind of game, a Canadian brother hunter  tells how to train dogs for 'coon when he has no old dog to teach the  young one.    1st. Set a trap where you see 'coon signs as follows: Take the skin  or part of a good sized green codfish, tie it to a string and drag it  along the bank of a creek or place where you see their signs, to the  place you wish to set your trap.    2nd. Take a good sized stick about 4 feet long, drive it well on a  nice flat piece of land, then tie what you have dragged to this stick  about 20 inches from the ground. Have the bait well tied so that Mr.  'Coon will have a hard job to pull a piece off.    3rd. Take three No. 1 1/2 or larger size steel traps, but not very  stiff spring, set them 8 inches from the stick and arrange in such a  way as to form a triangle. Have the chains well secured so that Mr.  'Coon will only be caught in one of the traps. Dig holes for four  traps and cover chain and traps with dry grass or leaves. Be careful  not to put anything to interfere with the jaws of your traps and make  things look as natural as possible. Visit your traps the next morning  and the chances will be that you will have one or two 'coons waiting  you. I have often found three waiting me in one setting as above.  When you have a coon or two, take one at a time to an open field  about 400 yards from the bush, then tie a long clothes line to the  ring of the chain in such a way that it will not slip off. At the  other end of the line, tie something white, and allow Mr. 'Coon to  make for the bush. Have a friend with you that will keep an eye on  Mr. 'Coon. Then take your dog to the spot in the field where the coon  started from, and make him take the scent, and once he has it in the  right direction and commences to pull, turn him loose and follow him.    If the hound comes from good stock, he will soon find Mr. 'Coon and  will bark at him. Encourage him and have your friend pull on the line  in order to make the 'coon move. The dog will then catch him; after  the hound has pinched the 'coon a couple of times, throw the line  over a branch of some good sized tree and help the 'coon to climb.  Allow the dog to bark for a while. Shoot the coon, open him at once  and blood your dog well by rubbing the blood on his front legs and  over his body.    If you have another coon, repeat the same with the second as you have  done with the first, but in another direction of the field and bush.  Always allow the 'coon to go far enough so that your dog will not see  him. When you take him where the coon scent is, after the 'coon is  dead and your dog well blooded, go home with your dog and 'coon.  Chain your dog and put the 'coon near him for three or four hours  before skinning and while doing this, have your dog near you. The  next day, take your dog where 'coons are moving and he will soon have  one for you. Repeat the blooding every time and you will soon have a  No. 1 'coon dog.      [Illustration: Co-operation Between the Man and His Dogs Brings  Results.]        CHAPTER X.    TRAINING--RANDOM SUGGESTIONS FROM MANY SOURCES.    Summing up we find much pointed and valuable information relating to  the training of dogs omitted thru lack of space. From this we present  a chapter of \"nuggets\" in paragraph form, which will no doubt prove  interesting and beneficial to those interested in training hunting  dogs. Here are a few things not to do:    Don't allow your dogs to run into every farmyard as you pass along  the road.    Don't allow them to be used with which to run stock.    Don't let them get into the habit of running other dogs.    Don't let them run house-cats.    Don't teach him to be called by shooting.    Don't, when out hunting, keep urging him all the time.    Don't let every one have him to hunt with or he will soon be  everybody's dog.    Don't allow them to come into the house and get into every pan and  kettle, if your wife is good-natured.    Don't correct him by pulling his ears, for a fox dog needs his  hearing.    Don't feed but twice a day, and don't stint him on his feed before  starting on a race.    Don't allow him to run loose when you are not using him.      * * *    Did you ever try using a sheep bell on a still trailer on windy,  stormy nights? It's a such bells on sheep and disregard them until  the dog but 'coon usually become accustomed to sheep bells on sheep  and disregards them until the dog gets too close for them to escape.  Then, where not accustomed to the bell, their curiosity overcomes  their fear. The best pair of 'coon dogs I ever owned was Sport, a fox  hound and collie, half and half, a slow semi-mute trailer, and Simon,  a full blood fox terrier, a fast mute trailer. I used a bell on  Sport. This and his occasional barks on the trail kept the attention  of the 'coon while Simon cut across lots and invariably took him  unawares.    I have learned at considerable expense that the best at most any  price is the cheapest. If you want a good, cheap 'coon dog, get a  half pup collie and half fox hound. Never give him a taste of nor let  him see a rabbit, teach him a few tricks (to make him pay for his  meals), such as jumping over a stick, then a pole, then a fence. This  is to teach him to obey every word.    Never scold or whip him, gain his confidence, teach him to speak for  bits of meat so when the time comes to hunt 'coon you can get  him to  bark up; get him to catch and carry and he will often catch an  opossum or maybe a mink or 'coon and kill it when away from you, and  if you teach him to bring everything (rats, woodchucks) home to you,  he will do the same in the woods after night. Never let him get  whipped by another dog or woodchuck, 'coon or even a big rat. Always  help him kill or whip everything he jumps on to or that jumps on to  him. A defeat will discourage him.    When your young dog is ready for a night hunt in the woods or  cornfield, choose the best and most favorable night for the first  trip. Feed no meat nor milk for 24 hours previous to the first or any  subsequent trip, for that matter, for the best dogs, full of meat or  milk, cannot do good work on the most favorable night. Feed him a  good dinner of vegetables, but no supper until you return from the  hunt, then give him anything. Choose a dark and cloudy night, the  darker the better, not too still, as usually on very still nights the  atmosphere is heavy and smoke settles to the earth, so likewise does  the scent of the 'coon trail, and many a fine dog has been condemned  for failing to locate his 'coon when started under such a condition  as this.      * * *    Do not return home and leave your hounds in the woods, rather walk a  mile or two to catch them and they will be in better shape to hunt  the next day than if you had allowed them to run all night.      * * *    I notice so many of the boys in telling of their 'coon hunting say  when Old Jack or Trailer, or whatever his name might be, strikes a  trail they follow him as fast as they can run until out of wind, then  as soon as he barks treed, they go to him on the double quick, over  logs, brush, barb wire fences, thru brier patches, swamps and so on.  Now, this may be all right, I am not condemning any one else's method  of hunting, but just want to exchange ideas. When my dog strikes a  trail or I have reason to think there is anything doing, I just wait  right where I am until they tree or come back to me. If they bark  treed, I just take my time and if I know of a way around that will  save going thru some thicket or up some very steep hill, I just go  around and save those hardships. And another thing I never do is  whoop and hallo at my dogs when they are working. I think that has  spoiled many a good dog, and never run to a dog as soon as he barks  up, but give him time to think it over and circle the tree a few  times; then, when he settles down again you can go to him and depend  upon the 'coon being there.        PART II.    BREEDING AND CARE OF DOGS.      [Illustration: Some Ideals.]        CHAPTER XI.    SELECTING THE DOG.    Different hunters have different ideas as to the style of dog best  suited to their purposes. We can only approach the subject, by giving  views of experienced breeders, and the reader may choose as he is  inclined.    From a Canadian Hunter comes the following:    This question of the right kind of dogs to select is a matter on  which many sportsmen differ in opinion. Some prefer the small, some  the medium and others the large hound. For me I like a hound to be  from 24 to 27 inches high at the shoulder and well put together, with  a lot of bones, straight front legs with strong and compact feet,  \"but not too large\" with good strong nails well set in, the body to  be long and not short of flank with a wide chest and a moderate deep  chest and with a strong broad back, hind legs with the right kind of  bend, that is neither straight or too much curved in,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#9)"],[1,"1 Lit. who blow on knots.

Guide Thou us on the straight path,2    The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;with whom thou art not  angry, and who go not astray.3      _______________________    1 This Sura, which Nöldeke places last, and Muir sixth, in the earliest class  of Meccan Suras, must at least have been composed prior to Sura xxxvii.  182,where it is quoted, and to Sura xv. 87, which refers to it. And it can  scarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first, second,  and fifth verses do not occur in any other Suras of the first Meccan period  as given by Nldeke, but frequently in those of the second, which it  therefore, in Nldeke, opinion, immediately precedes. But this may be  accounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private and  public devotion by Muhammad himself, which is the meaning probably of the  Muhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice.  It should also be observed  that, including the auspicatory formula, there are the same number of  petitions in this Sura as in the Lord's Prayer. It is recited several times  in each of the five daily prayers, and on many other occassions, as in  concluding a bargain, etc. It is termed \"the Opening of the Book,\" \"the  Completion,\" \"the Sufficing Sura,\" the Sura of Praise, Thanks, and Prayer,\"  \"the Healer,\" \"the Remedy,\" \"the Basis,\" \"the Treasure,\" \"the Mother of the  Book,\" \"the Seven Verses of Repetition.\" The Muhammadans always say \"Amen\"  after this prayer, Muhammad having been instructed, says the Sonna, to do so  by the Angel Gabriel.    2 Islam    3 The following transfer of this Sura from the Arabic into the corresponding  English characters may give some idea of the rhyming prose in which the Koran  is written:    Bismillahi 'rahhmani 'rrahheem.

To you be your religion; to me my religion.1      _______________________    1 This Sura is said to have been revealed when Walîd urged Muhammad to  consent that his God should be worshipped at the same time with the old  Meccan deities, or alternately every year. Hishâmi, p. 79; Tabari, p. 139. It  is a distinct renunciation of Meccan idolatry, as the following Sura is a  distinct recognition of the Divine Unity.

The following six Suras, like the two  first, have special reference to the difficulties which the Prophet met with  the outset of his career, especially from the rich.    2 In allusion to the meaning of Abu Lahab, father of flame.

But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches,    And calleth the Good a lie,    To him will we make easy the path to misery:    And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down?    Truly mans guidance is with Us    And Ours, the Future and the Past.    I warn you therefore of the flaming fire;    None shall be cast to it but the most wretched,    Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back.    But the God-fearing shall escape it,    Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure;2    And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense,    But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High.    And surely in the end he shall be well content.      _______________________    1  See Pref., p. 5, line I.  2  Comp. Luke xi. 41.

Now thy Lord! well knoweth He the man who erreth from his path, and well doth  he know those who have yielded to Guidance;    Give not place, therefore, to those who treat thee as a liar:    They desire thee to deal smoothly with them: then would they be smooth as oil  with thee:    But yield not to the man of oaths, a despicable person,    Defamer, going about with slander,    Hinderer of the good, transgressor, criminal,    Harshbeside this, impure by birth,    Though a man of riches and blessed with sons.

Then at dawn they called to each other,    \"Go out early to your field, if ye would cut your dates.\"    So on they went whispering to each other,    \"No poor man shall set foot this day within your garden;\"    And they went out at daybreak with this settled purpose.    But when they beheld it, they said, \"Truly we have been in fault:    Yes! we are forbidden our fruits.\"    The most rightminded of them said, \"Did I not say to you, Will ye not give  praise to God?\"    They said, \"Glory to our Lord! Truly we have done amiss.\"    And they fell to blaming one another:    They said, \"Oh woe to us! we have indeed transgressed!
