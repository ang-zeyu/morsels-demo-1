As mentioned in a previous chapter one will often get shots  at the adult animals near the dens and if one knows of the location  of a den, he may often get a shot by watching it. Anyway the rifle  should always be carried, and it should be used whenever a wolf or  coyote is seen within range.    We will conclude this chapter by giving an account of a coyote  still-hunt, as recorded by one of our western friends.    \"It was one of those bright balmy September mornings, so  characteristic of Wyoming, that I drove my horses down to water and  noticed some coyote tracks in the mud at the edge of the water hole,  and I decided then and there to have a coyote hunt that day. I was at  the time in charge of a relay station, midway between two small towns  and it was my business to look after the spare stage horses, for the  stage driver changed teams here, leaving the tired horses in my care  and taking on fresh ones. The northbound stage passed about 8:30 A.  M., and the southbound outfit was due at about 6:30 P. M., which left  me with practically the entire day at my disposal, to do with as I  liked, and having my full quota of the spirit of our savage  ancestors, I naturally turned to hunting the coyotes which abounded  in that section.    \"For some time past I had been doing practically no hunting. I say  'practically none' for I had not been out on a real hunt for several  weeks, but I did have a short line of traps set and had been looking  at them every second morning. On these trips over the trap line I  always carried my 30-30 carbine on the saddle and had surprised and  shot three coyotes, besides shooting at several more, one of which  was wounded but escaped by crawling into a deep hole in a bad-land  butte. Besides the three animals mentioned, I had caught in my traps  up to that time, some twenty more.      [Illustration: Killed by the Still Hunt.]    \"On this particular morning the 'Spirit of the Wild' called loudly,  for as every hunter knows, there is something in the air of autumn  which gets into one's blood at times, and there is no remedy except  to go on a hunt. My trap line had been looked at the day before, so I  was free for the day. Returning to the little sod house which I  called my home, I got my rifle and six shooter, prepared a lunch and  as soon as the stage had arrived, changed horses and departed, I  mounted my horse and hit the trail for the hills to the westward.    \"The section of the country to the west of the station was of the  bad-land type, groups of buttes and ridges, radiating in every  direction, seamed and honey-combed by the rains of centuries. While  the country is very dry, the rains are veritable deluges when they do  come, and the ordinarily dry water courses become raging torrents.  Along these creek beds, sage and grease wood brush was abundant; in  the hills, no vegetation was to be found. It was at all times a  paradise for coyotes and occasionally a band of grey wolves strayed  through those parts. However, the wolves had been rarely met with  since the stockmen had abandoned the cattle industry and gone to  sheep raising, but the coyotes had increased in numbers.    \"At this time of the year, the sheep were being driven down from the  mountains into their winter range and in addition to the coyotes  which remained, throughout the summer, in the bad-lands, the still  larger number which make a practice of following up the great bands  of sheep were also appearing on the scene, and the day promised good  sport.    \"Riding westward about two and a half miles, I struck the bed of a  stream and followed it up towards the hills. Here, I knew there were  several prairie dog villages and about such places one is almost  certain to find coyotes, so I turned my horse that way in the hope of  getting a shot at one of the wary animals. My fond hopes were  realized, for on rounding the hill at the edge of the first village I  saw a large coyote slinking guiltily over the crest of the nearest  ridge, but giving me no chance to draw the gun before he passed out  of sight. Hastily riding to the top of the ridge, I saw the animal  making his get-away down the draw at the other side and throwing my  carbine to my shoulder, I caught a quick aim and fired just as he was  rounding a spur of the ridge about a hundred and fifty yards away.  Snap-shooting from horseback is uncertain at all times and on this  occasion I had barely time to catch a half-hearted aim, so was not  very hopeful regarding the results of my shot.    \"Riding up to the spot, I dismounted and on looking the ground over,  was elated to find a splotch of blood, but farther search revealed no  other traces of the game. Naturally, I supposed that the animal had  gone on down the draw and mounting my horse I rode slowly down the  hollow, keeping a sharp lookout for the coyote. After looking the  ground over for a quarter of a mile or more, and finding no signs of  the game, I decided that this animal, anyway, was lost and returned  to the scene of the shooting. Dismounting once more, I took the rifle  and climbed to the top of the ridge to see what lay beyond. Imagine  my surprise and delight when on reaching the top, which was low at  this point, I saw the wounded coyote, vainly endeavoring to escape at  the bottom of the depression on the other side.    \"The first glance showed that the animal was badly wounded and could  not last long, but fearing that it would fall into a hole, I took a  hasty shot and had the satisfaction of seeing it crumple down,  apparently lifeless. On approaching, however, I found that it still  retained enough life to make a vicious snap at my hand, missing that  member by only a few inches. As I watched it, undecided whether to  shoot it again or leave it bide its own time, it breathed its last.    \"It was a fine, large specimen and after skinning it, which required  some twenty minutes of my time, I looked it over and found that my  first bullet had struck it in the right hip, breaking the bone and  passing through the body diagonally, emerging at the left shoulder.  It was certainly a good shot and had I been using soft point bullet  cartridges instead of full metal patched, the animal would have been  killed instantly. It is surprising, however, how tenacious of life  these animals are. The second shot had passed through the shoulders.    \"I returned to the prairie dog villages but saw no more coyotes. I  did see a badger and fired at it just as it was about to enter the  burrow, but missed the animal entirely. Going back to the creek bed I  followed on up into the hills to a small alkali spring where I halted  to eat my lunch. The water from this spring entirely disappears  within two hundred yards of the place where it rises. The sun was  shining fiercely hot by this time, and after eating my lunch I made a  cigarette and crawled into the grateful shadow of the bank where I  rested for a full hour. I had intended to make a large circle but  found now that I would not have the time that such a trip would  necessitate and so decided to go on northward through this range of  hills and return home over the trap line.    \"At the edge of the hills I found the traces of a sheep outfit and on  rounding a spur so as to obtain a good view of the little valley  beyond, I saw the white topped wagon of the herder at the far-side,  but the sheep were farther down the hollow. Here I expected to find  coyotes and I was not disappointed, for on riding through a patch of  sage which covered several acres, a coyote broke cover on the  opposite side. Three shots followed each other in rapid succession,  throwing dirt and gravel over the fleeing animal but without harming  him, and having no other effect than to increase his speed. I  followed for some distance but failed to get another shot at the  coyote and soon lost sight of it. Signs of coyotes were numerous here  and about a mile farther I found the remains of two sheep which had  been killed and eaten by the animals.    \"As I rode over a small sag of a ridge and entered the head of a long  narrow hollow, I saw a coyote trotting along down the draw about two  hundred yards below me. The animal started to run before I could  catch aim and I emptied the magazine in short order the last shot  dropping the coyote, but it was not badly hurt and leaping to its  feet it made off down the hollow. However, it enabled me to get quite  close and putting spurs to the horse, I followed the animal, firing  with my revolver. The third shot rolled it over and a fourth finished  it, making two coyotes out of three shot at that day.    \"Skinning the animal I mounted and hurried on to look at the traps.  There were sixteen traps in the line and all but two of them had been  undisturbed. Of these two, the bait was taken from one but the wary  animal had apparently known just where the trap lay and had avoided  it, the other held a young, female coyote. After looking at the  traps, I returned home and dressed and stretched the skins of the  captured animals.    \"The skin of the coyote is of no value as fur, at that time of the  year, but the combined state and stockmen's bounties aggregated $4 on  each animal, so that I had $12 for my day's hunt. During the fall and  early winter I captured by means of traps and gun, a hundred and  thirty-three coyotes and four wolves. All of the unprime skins taken  that fall were tanned by myself and made into robes.\"        CHAPTER VIII.    POISONING WOLVES.    Poisoning noxious animals is a common practice and is much used where  the only object is to destroy the animals, and the finding of the  carcass is of little moment, but the real hunters and trappers seldom  resort to this method because of the large numbers of animals that  are killed and lost. It is, indeed, a wasteful method of hunting as  in all probability, three-fourths of the animals killed by the  poisoned baits are not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#9)"],[1,"oul. Two of these stations had turbid water and all suffered  from siltation.    In Middle Caney Creek the species was rare but in the Elk River (June  28) more than 100 specimens, predominantly young, were taken. This  station consisted of a large isolated pool with a variety of bottom  types. Water was turbid and the surface temperature was high (93 deg. F.).  In different parts of the pool the following numbers of specimens were  taken in single seine-hauls: 15 over shallow bedrock; 35 over gravel  (1-1/2 feet deep); 50 over mud bottom (1 foot deep).    _P. promelas_ was found also in the large, flowing rivers: Arkansas,  Walnut, Verdigris, and Neosho. The species was scarce in the Arkansas  River, and was found principally in muddy coves. In the Walnut (W-3),  this minnow comprised 7.65 per cent of the fish taken and was common in  quiet pools.      #Campostoma anomalum# Rafinesque: Stations W-4, G-4, C-1, C-3, C-5, C-6,  C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, B-3  (E&F, C-131, C-136).    Although the stoneroller was found in most streams surveyed, it was  taken most often in the Big Caney system, where it occurred at 16 of the  18 stations. In contrast, it was represented at only one of 17 stations  on Grouse Creek. High percentages were found in three creeks--Cedar,  Otter, and Spring. As noted above, these streams are normally clear,  swift and have steep gradients and many rubble and gravel riffles. On  these riffles young stonerollers abounded. Station C-16 on Spring Creek  typifies the habitat in which this species was most abundant. The stream  has an average width of 10 feet and depth of a few inches. The volume of  flow was less than 1 cubic foot per second but turbulence was great.  Water was clear and the bottom was gravel and rubble. Following rains in  June, stonerollers quickly occupied parts of Spring Creek (upstream from  C-16) that had been dry throughout the previous winter.    On April 2 many _C. anomalum_ and _Etheostoma spectabile_ were taken in  shallow pools and riffles in an extensive bedrock-riffle area on Cedar  Creek near station C-12. Most of the females were gravid and the males  were in breeding condition. On June 6 these pools were revisited. Flow  had ceased and the pools were drying up. Young-of-the-year of the two  species were abundant, but only a few mature stonerollers were taken. On  August 24, prolonged drought had drastically altered the stream and all  areas from which stonerollers and darters had been taken were dry.  Seining of other pools which were almost dry revealed no stonerollers.    Collections on May 31, June 15, and June 16 in Otter Creek revealed  large numbers of stonerollers. They were found in riffle areas, in  aquatic vegetation, and especially in detritus alongside banks. Most of  the specimens were young-of-the-year.      #Anguilla bostoniensis# (Le Sueur): An American eel was caught by me in  Grouse Creek in 1949.      #Gambusia affinis# (Baird and Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-1, W-2,  W-3, W-4, W-5, G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, C-1, C-2, C-3,  C-4, C-6, C-15, E-1.    Mosquitofish occurred widely but in varied abundance. Huge populations  were in the shallow sandy backwaters and cut-off pools of the Arkansas  River. In the shallow pools of several intermittent streams such as  station G-8 on Silver Creek this fish also flourished.    _G. affinis_ was taken at every station in the Arkansas, Walnut and  Grouse systems except those stations on two upland tributaries of Grouse  Creek (Crab Creek and Grand Summit Creek). The mosquitofish was not  observed in the clear upland tributaries of Big Caney, nor on upper Big  Caney River itself in May, June, and July. On September 3, however,  _Gambusia_ were taken at station C-15 on Otter Creek and others were  seen at station C-14 on the same date.    Hubbs and Ortenburger (1929b:99) and Cross and Moore (1952:407) observed  that _G. affinis_ usually was absent from small upland tributaries, even  though it was abundant in lower parts of the same river systems.      #Fundulus kansae# (Garman): Stations A-2, A-3, Evermann and Fordice as  _Fundulus zebrinus_.    At station A-2, seven plains killifish were taken together with a great  many _Notropis deliciosus_ and _Gambusia affinis_ in a shallow,  algae-covered channel with slight flow and sand bottom. At station A-3  many young killifish were taken in small shallow pools on December 22.  _Fundulus kansae_ has been found in the lower part of the Walnut River  Basin, especially where petroleum pollution was evident. Eastward from  the Walnut River plains killifish have not been taken.      #Fundulus notatus# (Rafinesque): Stations B-1, G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5,  G-7, G-8, G-10, G-11, G-14, C-1, M-1, E-1, Evermann and Fordice as  _Zygonectes notatus_.    The black-banded topminnow was not taken in the Arkansas River but was  common in the Walnut and Grouse systems. It was common also in Middle  Caney, but in Big Caney and Elk River it was taken only at the lowermost  stations.    This species did not seem to ascend far into smaller tributaries of  Grouse Creek. In Crab Creek it was taken at the lower two of six  stations and in Grand Summit Creek at the lower of two stations.    The highest relative numbers were taken at stations G-3 (17.5 per cent),  G-4 (24 per cent), G-10 (25.75 per cent) and G-11 (41.52 per  cent), on Crab Creek and Grouse Creek. Both upstream and downstream from  these stations, which were within five miles of each other, the relative  abundance dropped off sharply. The bottoms at these stations were mostly  rubble and mud, and water was turbid at three of the stations. At G-10  (June 24) and G-11 (July 16) young-of-the-year were abundant.      #Ictalurus melas# (Girard): Stations W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5, B-1, B-2, B-3,  G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-11, G-12, G-13, G-14, G-17, C-1,  C-9, C-11, C-12, C-14, C-15, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, E-6, N-1,  Evermann and Fordice as _Ameiurus melas_ (C-133).    The black bullhead was taken at slightly more than half of the stations,  and probably was present at others. Larger numbers were taken in Grouse  Creek than in any other stream system. In many small, shallow pools in  the Grouse Creek system young black bullheads shared dominance with  _Gambusia affinis_ in the late summer. _I. melas_ was also abundant in  isolated pools at the extreme upper ends of Crab Creek, Beaver Creek and  Grand Summit Creek. _I. melas_ was most common in areas with silty  bottoms. The species seemed scarce in the main stream of Big Caney River  but was common in some of its tributaries.      #Pylodictis olivaris# (Rafinesque): Stations A-3, G-1, C-5.    Flathead catfish were taken by angling at stations A-3 and C-5. At  station G-1 (September 5) a flathead catfish five inches long was taken  in the four-foot nylon net.      #Ictalurus punctatus# (Rafinesque): Stations A-3, W-2, W-3, G-2, C-5,  E-4.    Channel catfish from stations W-3, A-3, and C-5 were taken on hook and  line. At station G-2 (August 29) twenty young-of-the-year were seined  from the shallow narrow end of a large pool. All collections of both _I.  punctatus_ and _P. olivaris_ were in the larger streams surveyed.      #Ictalurus natalis# (LeSueur): Stations G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-8, G-11,  C-12, C-14, C-15.    The yellow bullhead was taken at only 9 stations, compared with 33  stations for the black bullhead. _I. natalis_ was represented in 7 of  17 stations in the Grouse Creek system but in only 3 of 18 stations in  the Big Caney system. Of the seven records from Grouse Creek four were  from the main stream. At every station where yellow bullheads were  taken, black bullheads were found also and were abundant, usually  several times more abundant than _I. natalis_.    At G-11 on Crab Creek (July 16), _I. natalis_ made up 3.8 per cent of  the fish taken. All were young-of-the-year, existing in a tiny, gravelly  pool containing not more than five gallons of water, and were the only  fish present. Young yellow bullheads were also found in small pools with  gravel bottoms at station G-4 on September 7.      #Labidesthes sicculus# (Cope): Stations G-1, G-2, G-3, G-7, G-10, B-2,  C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-12, E-1, E-2, E-3, E-7, M-1 (E&F, C-131).    The brook silversides was taken, sometimes abundantly, in all stream  systems except the Walnut and Arkansas. At station G-7 on July 8, 41.8  per cent of the fish taken were of this species. _L. sicculus_ was most  abundant in large pools where the bottom was predominantly bedrock and  gravel. The highest concentrations were in the mainstreams of Big Caney,  Grouse, and Elk Rivers. Brook silversides were taken rarely in the  smaller tributaries of these streams.      #Percina phoxocephala# (Nelson): Stations C-2, C-3, C-5, G-1 (C-133).    Slenderhead darters were scarce, and were found only over gravel  bottoms. Specimens were taken from flowing and quiet water, and from  both shallow and deep water.    Larger numbers of _P. phoxocephala_ were taken by the writer in other  collections made during 1956 on the Neosho and Verdigris Rivers over  bottoms of rubble or gravel. Restriction of this darter to the larger  streams follows a pattern observed by Cross (1954a:313) who noted it was  absent from smaller riffles in minor tributaries. Elliott (1947),  however, took one specimen of _P. phoxocephala_ in Spring Creek, a  tributary of Fall River.      #Percina caprodes carbonaria# (Baird and Girard): Stations G-3, G-4,  G-7, G-12, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-9, C-12, C-13, C-14 (J&J, C-131, C-133).    The logperch was generally distributed in the Caney, Elk, and Grouse  systems. This species usually comprised less than 1 per cent of the fish  taken; however, at station G-12 it formed 3.76 per cent of the total.    In many instances the logperch was taken over submerged gravel bars,  often along the edges of the larger pools. At 8 of 13 stations where the  logperch was taken,"]]]
