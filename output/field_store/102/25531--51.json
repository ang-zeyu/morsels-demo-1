Or  round their brush piles an' storage heaps. And when I found a tree  they'd just partly cut down, I'd set a couple of traps, covered up in  leaves, each side of the trunk, where they'd have to step on the pan  when they stood up to gnaw.\"    \"Good for you!\" said Jabe, with cordial approbation. \"Ye'd make a  first-class trapper, 'cause ye've got the right notion. Every one of  them things is done, one time or another, by the old trapper. But  here's one or two wrinkles more killin' yet. An' moreover, if ye trap  a beaver on land ye're like to lose him one way or another. He's got  so much _purchase_, on land, with things to git hold on to; he's jest  as like as not to twist his leg clean off, an' git away. If it's one  of his fore legs, which is small an' slight, ye know, he's most sure  to twist it off. An' sometimes he'll do the trick even with a hind  leg. I've caught lots of beaver as had lost a fore leg, an' didn't  seem none the worse. The fur'd growed over it, an' they was slick an'  hearty. An' I've caught them as had lost a hind leg, an' they was in  good condition. A beaver'll stand a lot, I tell you. But then,  supposin' you git yer beaver, caught so fast he ain't no chance  whatever to git clear. Then, like as not, some lynx, or wildcat, or  fisher, or fox, or even maybe a bear, 'll come along an' help himself  to Mr. Beaver without so much as a by yer leave. No, ye want to git  him in the water; an' as he's just as anxious to git thar as you are  to git him thar, that suits all parties to a T.\"    [Illustration: \"'OR EVEN MAYBE A BEAR.'\"]    \"Good!\" said the Boy,--not that it really seemed to him good, but to  show that he was attending.    \"But,\" continued Jabe, \"what would ye say would most upset the beaver  and make 'em careless?\"    The Boy thought for a moment.    \"Breaking their dam!\" he answered tentatively.    \"_Eg_zactly!\" answered the woodsman. \"Well, now, to ketch beaver sure,  make two or three breaks in their dam, an' set the traps jest a leetle  ways above the break, on the upper slope, where they're sure to step  into 'em when hustlin' round to mend the damage. That gits 'em, every  time. Ye chain each trap to a stake, driven into three or four foot of  water; an' ye drive another stake about a foot an' a half away from  the first. When the beaver finds himself caught, he dives straight for  deep water,--his way of gittin' clear of most of his troubles. But  this time he finds it don't work. The trap keeps a holt, bitin' hard.  An' in his struggle he gits the chain all tangled up 'round the two  stakes, an' drowns himself. There you have him safe, where no lynx nor  fox kin git at him.\"    \"Then, when one of them dies so dreadfully, right there before their  eyes,\" said the Boy, \"I suppose the others skin out and let the  broken dam go! They must be scared to death themselves!\"    \"Not on yer life, they don't!\" responded Jabe. \"The dam's the thing  they care about. They jest keep on hustlin' round; an' they mend up  that dam if it takes half the beaver in the pond to do it. Oh, they're  grit, all right, when it comes to standin' by the dam.\"    \"Hardly seems fair to take them that way, does it?\" mused the Boy  sympathetically.    \"It's a good way,\" asserted Jabe positively, \"quick an' sure! Then, in  winter there's another good an' sure way,--where ye don't want to  clean out the whole house, which is killin' the goose what lays the  golden egg, like the Injuns does! Ye cut a hole in the ice, near the  bank. Then ye git a good, big, green sapling of birch or willow, run  the little end 'way out into the pond under the ice, an' ram the big  end, sharpened, deep into the mud of the bank, so the beaver can't  pull it out. Right under this end you set yer trap. Swimmin' round  under the ice, beaver comes across this fresh-cut sapling an' thinks  as how he's got a good thing. He set right to work to gnaw it off,  close to the bank, to take it back to the house an' please the  family. First thing, he steps right into the trap. An' that's the end  of him. But other beaver'll come along an' take the sapling, all the  same!\"    \"You spoke of the ways the Indians had, of cleaning out the whole  family,\" suggested the Boy, when Jabe had come to a long pause, either  because he was tired of talking or because he had no more to say.    \"Yes, the Injuns' methods was complete. They seemed to have the idee  there'd always be beaver a-plenty, no matter how many they killed. One  way they had was to mark down the bank holes, the burrows, an' then  break open the houses. This, ye must understand, 's in the winter,  when there's ice all over the pond. When they're drove from their  houses, in the winter, they take straight to their burrows in the  bank, where they kin be sure of gittin' their heads above water to  breathe. Then, the Injuns jest drive stakes down in front of the  holes,--an' there they have 'em, every one. They digs down into the  burrows, an' knocks Mr. Beaver an' all the family on the head.\"    \"Simple and expeditious!\" remarked the Boy, with sarcastic approval.    \"But the nestest job the Injuns makes,\" continued Jabe, \"is by  gittin' at the brush pile. Ye know, the beaver keeps his winter  supply of grub in a pile,--a pile of green poles an' saplings an'  branches,--a leetle ways off from the house. The Injun finds this  pile, under the ice. Then, cuttin' holes through the ice, he drives  down a stake fence all 'round it, so close nary a beaver kin git  through. Then he pulls up a stake, on the side next the beaver  house, an' sticks down a bit of a sliver in its place. Now ye kin  guess what happens. In the house, over beyant, the beavers gits  hungry. One on 'em goes to git a stick from the pile an' bring it  inter the house. He finds the pile all fenced off. But a stick he  must have. Where the sliver is, that's the only place he kin git  through. Injun, waitin' on the ice, sees the sliver move, an' knows  Mr. Beaver's gone in. He claps the stake down agin, in place of the  sliver. An' then, of course, there's nawthin' left fer Mr. Beaver to  do but drown. He drowns jest at the place where he come in an'  couldn't git out agin. That seems to knock him out, like, an' he  jest gives up right there. Injun fishes him out, dead, puts the  sliver back, an' waits for another beaver. He don't have to wait  long--an' nine times outer ten he gits 'em all. Ye see, they _must_  git to the brush pile!\"    [Illustration: \"HE DROWNS JEST AT THE PLACE WHERE HE COME IN.\"]    \"I'm glad _you_ don't trap them that way, Jabe!\" said the Boy. \"But  tell me, why did you bring me away out here to _this_ pond, to tell me  all this, when you could have done it just as well at _my_ pond?\"    \"I jest wanted the excuse,\" answered Jabe, \"fer takin' a day off from  cruisin'. Now, come on, an' I'll show ye some more likely ponds.\"          CHAPTER VII    Winter Under Water      FOR three days more the Boy and Jabe remained in the beaver country;  and every hour of the time, except when he had to sleep, the Boy found  full of interest. In the daytime he compared the ponds and the dams  minutely, making measurements and diagrams. At night he lay in hiding,  beside a different pond each night, and gained a rich store of  knowledge of the manners and customs of the little wilderness  engineers. On one pond--his own, be it said--he made a rude raft of  logs, and by its help visited and inspected the houses on the island.  The measurements he obtained here made his note-book pretty complete,  as far as beaver life in summer and fall was concerned.    Then Jabe finished his cruising, having covered his territory. The  packs were made up and slung; the two campers set out on their three  days' tramp back to the settlements; and the solemn autumn quiet  descended once more upon the placid beaver ponds, the shallow-running  brooks, and the low-domed Houses in the Water.    As the weather grew colder; and the earlier frosts began to sheathe  the surface of the pond with clear, black ice, not melting out till  noon; and the bitten leaves, turning from red and gold to brown, fell  with ghostly whisperings through the gray branches, the little beaver  colony in Boy's Pond grew feverishly active. Some subtle prescience  warned them that winter would close in early, and that they must make  haste to finish their storing of supplies. The lengthening of their  new canal completed, their foraging grew easier. Trees fell every  night, and the brush pile reached a size that guaranteed them immunity  from hunger till spring. By the time the dam had been strengthened to  withstand the late floods, there had been some sharp snow-flurries,  and the pond was half frozen over. Then, in haste, the beavers brought  up a quantity of mud and grass roots, and plastered the domes of their  houses thickly till they no longer looked like heaps of sticks, but  rather resembled huge ant-hills. No sooner was this task done than, as  if the beavers had been notified of its coming, the real cold came.  In one night the pond froze to a depth of several inches; and over the  roof of the House in the Water was a casing of armour hard as stone.    The frost continued for several days, till the stone-like roof was a  good foot in thickness, as was the ice over the surface of the pond.  Then a thick, feather-soft, windless snow-fall, lasting twenty-four  hours, served as a blanket against the further piercing of the frost;  and the beavers, warm-housed, well-provisioned, and barricaded against  all their enemies but man, settled themselves down to their long  seclusion from the white, glittering, bitter, outside world.    When the winter had tightened its grip, this outside world was full of  perils. Hungry lynxes, foxes, and fishers (\"black cat,\" the woodsman  called them) hunted through the silent and pallid aisles of the  forest. They all would have loved a meal of warm, fat beaver-meat; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#9)"],[1,"size of  the Common Tern, but has a darker mantle, and the forehead is white,  leaving a black line from the bill to the eye. They nest on islands off  the coast of Alaska, sometimes together with the Arctic Tern. The eggs  are laid upon the bare ground or moss, and are similar to the Arctic  Terns, but average narrower. They are two or three in number and are  laid in June and July. Size 1.70 x 1.15. Data.--Stuart Is., Alaska.  Three eggs in a slight hollow in the moss.    [Illustration 056: Arctic Tern. Roseate Tern. Aleutian Tern.]  [Illustration: Grayish or Brownish.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 55    74. LEAST TERN. _Sterna antillarum._    Range.--From northern South America to southern New England, Dakota and  California, breeding locally throughout its range.    These little Sea Swallows are the smallest of the Terns, being but 9  inches in length. They have a yellow bill with a black tip, a black  crown and nape, and white forehead. Although small, these little Terns  lose none of the grace and beauty of action of their larger relatives.  They nest in colonies on the South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, placing  their eggs upon the bare sand, where they are sometimes very difficult  to see among the shells and pebbles. They are of a grayish or buffy  color spotted with umber and lilac. They number two, three and rarely  four, and are laid in May and June. Size 1.25 x .95. Data.--DeSota  Beach, Fla., May 20, 1884. Three eggs laid on the sandy beach.  Collector, Chas. Graham.      75. SOOTY TERN. _Sterna fuscata._    Range.--Tropical America, north to the South Atlantic States. This  species measures 17 inches in length; it has a brownish black mantle,  wings and tail, except the outer feathers of the latter which are white;  the forehead and under parts are white, the crown and a line from the  eye to the bill, black. This tropical species is very numerous at its  breeding grounds on the small islands of the Florida Keys and the West  Indies. They lay but a single egg, generally placing it on the bare  ground, or occasionally building a frail nest of grasses. The egg has a  pinkish white or creamy ground and is beautifully sprinkled with spots  of reddish brown and lilac. They are laid during May. Size 2.05 x 1.45.  Data.--Clutheria Key, Bahamas, May 28, 1891. Single egg laid on bare  ground near water. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.    [Illustration 057: Light buff.]  [Illustration: Least Tern. Sooty Tern.]  [Illustration: Creamy white.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 56    76. BRIDLED TERN. _Sterna anaetheta._    Range.--Found in tropical regions of both hemispheres; casual or  accidental in Florida. This Tern is similar to the last except that the  nape is white and the white of the forehead extends in a line over the  eye. The Bridled Tern is common on some of the islands of the West  Indies and the Bahamas, nesting in company with the Sooty Terns and  Noddies. The single egg is laid on the seashore or among the rocks. It  is creamy white beautifully marked with brown and lilac. Size 1.85 x  1.25. Data.--Bahamas, May 9, 1892. Single egg laid in a cavity among the  rocks. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.    77. BLACK TERN. _Hydrochelidon nigra surinamensis._    Range.--Temperate America, breeding from the middle portions of the  United States northward to Alaska; south in winter beyond the United  States Border.    The identity of these Terns cannot be mistaken. They are but ten inches  in length; the whole head, neck and under parts are black; the back,  wings and tail are slaty and the under tail coverts are white. Their  dainty figure with their long slender wings gives them a grace and  airiness, if possible, superior to other species of the family. They are  very active and besides feeding upon all manner of marine crustacea,  they capture many insects in the air. They nest in large colonies in  marshes, both along the coast and in the interior, making a nest of  decayed reeds and grasses, or often laying their eggs upon rafts of  decayed vegetation which are floating on the water. The nesting season  commences in May, they laying three eggs of a brownish or greenish  color, very heavily blotched with blackish brown. Size 1.35 x .95.  Data.--Winnebago City, Minn., May 31, 1901. Three eggs. Nest made of a  mass of weeds and rushes floating on water in a swamp. Collector, R. H.  Bullis.    [Illustration 058: Creamy white.]  [Illustration: Black Tern. Noddy. Black Skimmer.]  [Illustration: Deep greenish brown.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 57    78. WHITE-WINGED BLACK TERN. _Hydrochelidon leucoptera._    Range.--Eastern Hemisphere, its addition to American birds being made  because of the accidental appearance of one bird in Wisconsin in 1873.  They nest very abundantly among the lakes and marshes of southern  Europe, placing their eggs the same as the American species, upon masses  of decayed reeds and stalks. They lay three eggs which have a somewhat  brighter appearance than the common Black Terns because of a somewhat  lighter ground color.      79. NODDY. _Anous stolidus._    Range.--Tropical America, north to the Gulf and South Atlantic States.    A peculiar but handsome bird (about fifteen inches long), with a silvery  white head and the rest of the plumage brownish, and the tail rounded.  They breed in abundance on some of the Florida Keys, the West Indies and  the Bahamas. Their nests are made of sticks and grass, and are placed  either in trees or on the ground. They lay but a single egg with a buffy  or cream colored ground spotted with chestnut and lilac. Size 2.00 x  1.30. Atwood's Key, Bahamas, June 1, 1891. Nest made of sticks and  grasses, three feet up a mangrove. Collector, D. P. Ingraham.    [Illustration 059: Greenish buff.]  [Illustration: Buff.]  [Illustration: Noddy.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 58    SKIMMERS. Family RYNCHOPIDAE    Skimmers are Tern-like birds having a very strangely developed bill. The  lower mandible is much longer than the upper and very thin, the upper  edge being as sharp as the lower. The lower mandible is rounded at the  end while the upper is more pointed. Young Skimmers are said to have  both mandibles of the same length, the abnormal development not  appearing until after flight. Skimmers are very graceful birds, and, as  implied by their name, they skim over the surface of the water, rising  and falling with the waves, and are said to pick up their food by  dropping the lower mandible below the surface, its thin edge cutting the  water like a knife. There are four species of Skimmers, only one of  which is found in North America.      80. BLACK SKIMMER. _Rynchops nigra._    Range.--The South Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, breeding from New Jersey  southward. The Black Skimmer is about eighteen inches in length, and  besides the remarkable bill is a bird of striking plumage; the forehead,  ends of the secondaries, tail feathers and under parts are white; the  rest of the plumage is black and the basal half of the bill is crimson.  Skimmers nest in large communities, the same as do the Terns, laying  their eggs in hollows in the sand. They are partially nocturnal in their  habits and their hoarse barking cries may be heard after the shadows of  night have enveloped the earth. Fishermen call them by the names of  \"Cut-water\" and \"Sea Dog.\" The nesting season commences in May and  continues through June and July. They lay from three to five eggs,  having a creamy or yellowish buff ground, blotched with black, chestnut  and lilac. Size 1.75 x 1.30. Data.--Cobb's Is., Va., June 8, 1894. Three  eggs laid in a hollow on the beach. No nest.    [Illustration 060: Buffy yellow.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 59    TUBE-NOSED SWIMMERS. Order III. TUBINARES.    ALBATROSSES. Family DIOMEDEIDAE    Albatrosses are the largest of the sea birds and have an enormous  expanse of wing, the Wandering Albatross, the largest of the family,  sometimes attaining an expanse of fourteen feet. Their nostrils consist  of two slightly projecting tubes, one on each side near the base of the  bill. They are unsurpassed in powers of flight, but are only fair  swimmers and rarely, if ever, dive, getting their food, which consists  of dead animal matter, from the surface of the water.      81. BLACK-FOOTED ALBATROSS. _Diomedea nigripes._    Range.--North Pacific from California northward. This Albatross is  thirty-two inches in length; it is of a uniform sooty brown color  shading into whitish at the base of the bill, which is rounded. Like the  other members of the family, this species is noted for its extended  flights, following vessels day after day without any apparent period of  rest, for the purpose of feeding on the refuse that is thrown overboard.  They breed during our winter on some of the small isolated islands in  the extreme southern portions of the globe. They lay a single white egg  on the bare ground.      82. SHORT-TAILED ALBATROSS. _Diomedea albatrus._    Range.--North Pacific Ocean in summer, from Lower California to Alaska.  With the exception of the Wandering Albatross, which is now regarded as  doubtful as occurring off our coasts, the Short-tailed Albatross is one  of the largest of the group, measuring thirty-six inches in length, and  has an extent of seven feet or more. With the exception of the black  primaries, shoulders and tail, the entire plumage is white, tinged with  straw color on the back of the head. They breed on the guano islands in  the North Pacific off the coasts of Alaska and Japan. They lay a single  white egg on the bare ground or rocks. As with the other members of the  family, the eggs are extremely variable in size, but average about 4.25  x 2.50.    [Illustration 061: Black-footed Albatross.
