It is  confidently stated by those who pretend to know him that he is a Jew,  but he is not claimed by Hebrew writers, who are proud of enrolling  Bergson and Brandes, Spinoza and Strauss in their list. Vainly offering  his life for Italy, he is not somatically, mentally, or emotionally an  Italian. Knowing her history, her traditions, and her reactions as few  of her sons have known them, until the war he had not sung her virtues  or mirrored her wondrous accomplishments of nation-building. His face  has steadily been turned not toward the east, where the sun of her glory  is arising, but toward the west, where he has revelled in the  resurrected glows of sunsets of pagan and Renaissance days. He has  treated his friends disdainfully when it suited his whim; he has meted  out contumely to his adulators when it pleased his fancy; he has  disdained those who have accused him; he has passed unnoticed those who  have sought to belittle him; and he has gone among his superiors as if  he were their king. He has been called everything save Philistine and  fool. He has been called the greatest literary figure of modern Italy  and it is likely that he merits it.    He is a poet, novelist, dramatist, journalist, politician, critic,  propagandist, prophet, aviator, hero, dictator, and self-constituted  arbiter of Italy's destinies.    Neither his peer nor his superior has ever denied him a rare  imagination, an artistic intelligence of extraordinary range, depth and  exquisiteness, a stupendous versatility and productiveness, a tireless  energy, a fearless daring and a supreme contempt for the feelings,  beliefs, and accomplishments of others.    There are two ways of approaching an estimate of D'Annunzio. One is to  analyze him--to set him up as a god or a monster and to dissect him and  study the elements of his complex mechanism, then put them together  patiently and laboriously as one puts together a jigsaw picture-puzzle.  It is the tempting way, but it risks injuring the sensibilities of his  admirers and the judicially minded who are so constituted that they  cannot pass judgment unless they are in possession of all the facts  concerning him and his career: what he did and the circumstances  attending the doing of them, that is, the environment in which they were  done--both that which he created and that which was thrust upon him.  Finally they want to view him in rest and in action. Then they are ready  to render a verdict in much the same way as a jury renders a verdict  with or without the analysis and summing up of the testimony and  evidence by proponent or opponent advocate. The way of synthesis would  be the way to approach an interpretation of D'Annunzio if the man were  under discussion, but here only an estimate of his literary career is  attempted.    There is no dearth of evidence to show that he was a precocious child  and a youth of prodigious intellectual acumen and prehensility, of  boundless self-confidence and fathomless egocentrism. His first  collection of verse, \"Primo Vere\" (\"First Beginnings\"), was published  when he was fifteen years old, and two years later he published a second  edition \"corrected with pen and fire and augmented.\" From the beginning  it was pointed out by critic and commentator that he plagiarized line  and verse from poets of Italy, such as Giambattista Marino, Niccolo  Tommaseo, and Giosue Carducci, and of other countries; but if the  accusations made any impression upon him it was not evident in his  future conduct, for later he took from Verga and Capuana, from Nietzsche  and Tolstoy, from Maeterlinck and Flaubert, from Ibsen and Dostoievsky,  and from countless others that which it pleased him to take.    His fame in Italy as a poet was heralded by the poet Giuseppe Chiarini,  who published an article which did for him what Octave Mirabeau's  article in the _Figaro_ of August 24, 1890, did for Maeterlinck. Before  he had reached his maturity he was hailed as the coming poet, whose  originality was admirable, whose sensuality was shocking but acceptable,  whose versatility was marvellous. There is nothing morbid, decadent, or  blatant in his early poems. In the \"Canto Novo,\" published in 1882, he  displayed the torridity of his temperament, the splendor of his  imagination, the ardency of his loves, and the implacability of his  hatreds. It swept like a fire over Italy. It was a lyric of the joy of  life, \"the immense joy of living, of being strong, of being young, of  biting with eager teeth the fruits of the earth, of looking with flaming  eyes upon the divine face of the world, as a lover looks upon his  mistress.\" It was followed in quick succession by \"Terra Vergine,\"  \"Intermezzo di Rime,\" and \"Il libro delle Vergini\" (\"The Book of the  Virgins\"), which enhanced his reputation and caused the Italians to hail  him intemperately.    He then went to Rome and began work as a journalist, but this did not  interfere with his output of poetry, and by 1892, when he began  publishing romances, he had established, by the publication of \"Isaotta  Guttadauro,\" the \"Elegie romane\" and the \"Odi navali,\" a reputation with  the reading public of being the most appealing, most satisfying poet in  Italy, and the critics were not at all sure he would not surpass  Carducci, who was then considered Italy's greatest poet and whose fame  has steadily increased.    His fame as a poet being established to his own satisfaction he turned  to the field of romance, and in the next five years (1893-1898) there  flowed from the printing-presses a series of romances that veritably  flooded literary Italy: \"L'Innocente,\" \"Il Piacere,\" \"Giovanni  Episcopo,\" \"Trionfo della Morte,\" \"Le Vergini delle Rocce,\" \"Forse che  si forse che no,\" and the \"Novelle della Pescara.\" They had a quality  that is not easily characterized by word or brief description. They were  \"sensuous,\" \"decadent,\" \"daring,\" \"shocking,\" \"brilliant.\" They were  modelled on Flaubert, Prevost, Huysmans; they were saturated with the  philosophy of Nietzsche, the psychology of Ibsen, the mysticism of  Maeterlinck, the morality of Petronius; they reek of the bestialities of  Wilde and Verlaine; they are the glorification of pagan ethics; they are  the apotheosis of lust. But they were read, discussed, admired, praised,  not only in Italy but the world over. I doubt that praise was ever given  so lavishly, so widely, and so unjustifiably as was given to this series  of romances, which to-day, a generation after their publication, are as  constant a reminder of a wayward step which Italian literature took at  the end of the nineteenth century as the linea alba on the torso of a  woman whose reputation for virtue is established and admitted reminds  her of a faux pas of her youth.    In these volumes the author showed that he had a marvellous capacity to  depict states of exalted sensibility; that he had an extraordinary,  almost superhuman sensitiveness to beauty as it is revealed in nature  and in art; that he had a clairvoyant knowledge of the activity of the  unconscious mind of human beings and how it conditions their behavior  under circumstances and environments fortuitous or chosen--in other  words, until it is revealed to them behavioristically; that he had a  comprehensive familiarity with plastic and pictorial art; an intimacy  with ancient history and modern literature that was stupendous, and  withal a capacity to externalize his visions, his emotional elaboration,  and his mental content in words so linked together that the very  juxtaposition of them is a pleasure to the eye and a satisfaction to the  soul.    But that which he knew best of all was the history of eroticism. Not  only was he familiar with its ancestry to the remotest time, but he had  guarded its infant days with such solicitude that he knew every  impression that worldly contact made upon its plastic consciousness, and  when it got its growth he set to work to ornament it so that contact  with it would be the apogee of all beauty, intimacy with it the purpose  of all ambition, union with it the object of all strife.    There are features of his romances that cannot be adequately praised;  there are features that cannot be sufficiently condemned. A poem that  contains no particular thought may excite our profoundest admiration,  just as does a _papier-mache_ triumphal arch or monument; but a romance  or novel depicts some phase or aspect of life, reveals man's aspirations  or accomplishments, his behaviors and reactions under certain  conditions, reflects his nobilities, depicts his frailties, and extols  his ambitions and what he would like to do, experience, or accomplish.  In a general way, it is expected that it shall be tuned to an ethical  pitch that will not give offense to the man of average Christian or  pagan morality, or outrage universally accepted and acceptable  convention. The most successful horticulturist in the world would find  no market for his roses, even though they were more exquisite than those  of all other florists, should he impregnate them with a scent obtained  from the Mustelidae. This is what D'Annunzio did.    It would be very difficult to find a religion, a form of government, a  code of ethics, a type of beauty, a map of life, a canon of morals, a  custom, habit, or a convention that something could not be said in  praise of it. Bolshevism has its attractive facet, even though the  present-day proponents of it have got it so deeply submerged in the mire  of ambition and power, and so defaced with lust for revenge that it  cannot be recognized. There is scarcely any form of those various  indulgences and commissions which are labelled \"vice\" that have not some  commendable and praiseworthy feature, but there is one aberration of  human conduct that has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41958"],[0,"The Microscope (#9)"],[1,"which are  well understood, and if not, will be rendered more intelligible by a  few minutes' examination of a microscope than by the most lengthened  description. One other point remains to be noticed. The movement  produced by the milled head K is not sufficiently delicate to adjust  the focus of very powerful lenses, nor indeed is any rack movement.  Only the finest screws are adapted to this purpose; and even these are  improved by means for reducing the rapidity of the screw's movement.  For this purpose the lower end of the compound body H, which carries  the object-glass, consists of a piece of smaller tube sliding in  parallel guides in the main body, and kept constantly pressed upwards  by a spiral spring but it can be drawn downward by a lever crossing  the body, and acted on by an extremely fine screw whose milled head  is seen at N, and the fineness of which is tripled by means of the  lever through which it acts on the object-glass. The instrument is of  course roughly adjusted by the rack movement, and finished by the  screw, or by such other means as are chosen for the purpose. One very  ingenious contrivance, but applied to the stage, instead of the body  of the microscope, invented by Mr. Powell, will be found described in  the 50th volume of the Transactions of the Society of Arts.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    The greater part of the directions for viewing and illuminating  objects given in reference to the simple microscope are applicable to  the compound. An argand lamp placed in the focus of a large detached  lens so as to throw parallel rays upon the mirror, is the best  artificial light; and for opaque objects the light so thrown up may be  reflected by metallic specula (called, from their inventor,  Lieberkhuns) attached to the object-glasses.    It has been recently proposed by Sir David Brewster and by M. Dujardin  to render the Wollaston condenser achromatic, and they have  accordingly been made with three pairs of achromatic lenses instead of  the single lens before described, with very excellent effect. The  last-mentioned gentleman has also projected an ingenious apparatus,  called the Hyptioscope, attached to the eye-piece for the purpose of  erecting the magnified picture.    The erector commonly applied to the compound microscope consists of a  pair of lenses acting like the erecting eye-piece of the telescope.  But this, though it is convenient for the purpose of dissection, very  much impairs the optical performance of the instrument.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    For drawing the images presented by the microscope the best apparatus  consists of a mirror M (Fig. 23), composed of a thin piece of rather  dark-colored glass cemented on to a piece of plate-glass inclined at  an angle of 45 deg. in front of the eye-glass E. The light escaping from  the eye-glass is assisted in its reflection upwards to the eye by the  dark glass, which effects the further useful purpose of rendering the  paper less brilliant, and thus enabling the eye better to see the  reflected image. The lens L below the reflector is to cause the light  from the paper and pencil to diverge from the same distance as that  received from the eye-glass; in other words, to cause it to reach the  eye in parallel lines.    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    Dr. Wollaston's camera lucida, as shown in Fig. 24, is sometimes  attached to the eye-piece of the microscope for the same purpose. In  this instrument the rays suffer two internal reflections within the  glass prism, as will be seen explained in the article \"Camera Lucida.\"  In this minute figure we have omitted to trace the reflected rays,  merely to avoid confusion.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    Annexed are four engravings of microscopic objects, the true character  of which it is, however, impossible to give in wood, and is difficult  indeed to accomplish by any description of engraving.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    Fig. 25 shows a scale of the small insect called Podura Plumbea, the  common Skiptail, magnified about five hundred times. To define the  markings on this scale clearly is the highest test of a deep  achromatic object-glass; and this drawing is given rather to explain  what the observer should look for, than as a very correct  representation. Fig. 26 is a scale or feather of the Menelaus  Butterfly; Fig. 27 is the hair of a singular insect, the Dermestes;  and Fig. 28 is a longitudinal cutting of fir, showing the circular  glands on the vessels which distinguish coniferous woods. These latter  objects may be seen by half-inch or quarter-inch achromatic glasses.  Opaque objects are generally better exhibited by inch and two-inch  glasses, when a general view of them is required, and by higher powers  when we wish to examine their minute structure. In the latter case the  light must be obtained by condensing lenses instead of the metallic  specula.    Although the reflecting microscope is now very little used, it may be  expected that we should mention it. In this instrument, at Fig. 29,  the object O is reflected by the inclined face of the mirror M, and  the rays are again reflected and converged by the ellipsoidal  reflector R R, which effects the same purpose as the object-glass of  the compound microscope. It forms an image which is not susceptible of  the over-correction as to color before described, and which therefore  becomes colored in passing through the eye-piece. This fact, and the  loss of light by reflection, will probably always render the  reflecting microscope inferior to the achromatic refracting.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]    The solar microscope has been so nearly superseded by the  oxy-hydrogen, that a brief description of the latter must suffice,  particularly as their optical principles are similar.    The primary object in both is to throw an intense light upon the  object, which is sometimes done by mirrors, and sometimes by lenses.  In Fig. 30, L represents the cylinder of burning lime, R R the  reflector, which concentrates the light upon the object O O; the rays  from which, passing through the two plano-convex lenses, are brought  to foci upon a screen placed at a great distance, and upon which is  formed the magnified image.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    Fig. 31 shows a combination of lenses to condense the light upon the  object. In either case the optical arrangements by which the image is  formed admit of the same perfection as those which have been described  for the compound microscopes. A few achromatic glasses for  oxy-hydrogen microscopes have been made, and they will ultimately  become valuable instruments for illustrating lectures on natural  history and physiology. One made by Mr. Ross was exhibited a few  months since at the Society of Arts to illustrate a lecture on the  physiology of woods. It should be observed, however, that the  oxy-hydrogen or solar microscope requires either a spherical screen,  or that the objects should be mounted between spherical glasses, in  order to bring the whole into focus at one time. This latter plan was  adopted on the occasion just mentioned with perfect success.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]"]]]
