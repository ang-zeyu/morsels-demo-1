Fertile eggs  that were in good condition had a characteristically turgid, springy  feel and could be bounced off a hard surface.    Temporary lack of moisture usually did not kill embryos; prolonged  dryness, combined with high temperatures, probably could not be  tolerated. Lynn and Ullrich (1950), by desiccating the eggs of  _Chrysemys picta_ and _Chelydra serpentina_, produced abnormalities in  the young ranging from slight irregularities of the shell to eyeless  monstrosities; eggs desiccated in the latter half of incubation  produced a higher percentage of abnormal young than eggs that were  desiccated earlier.    In 1956, three fertile eggs, from clutches that were at different  stages of incubation, were immersed in water for 48 hours. The eggs  rested on the bottom of the bowl in the same position in which they  had been placed in the incubation dishes; when turned, they returned  invariably to the original position. The embryos in two of the eggs  (one and 27 days old at the time of immersion) were still living ten  days after the eggs were removed from the water; the embryo in the  remaining egg (21 days old at the time of immersion) was dead. Eggs  immersed in water increased in size and weight at the same rate as  eggs in incubation dishes, indicating that absorption of water  probably operates on a threshold principle, the amount absorbed being  no more than normal even under wet conditions.    Natural nests usually are in well-drained areas, but water probably  stands in some nests for short periods after heavy rains. Provided the  nest cavity itself is not damaged, water in the nest is probably more  beneficial than harmful to the eggs; however, nests that are inundated  during floods probably have little chance of survival.      Embryonic Development    Eggs were examined by transmitted light in the course of incubation.  At the time of laying (or removal from oviducts) no embryonic  structures were discernible even in eggs that had been retained in the  oviducts of captive females some weeks past the normal time of laying;  a colorless blastodisc could be seen if eggs were opened. Embryonic  structures first became visible at eight to ten days of incubation; at  this time vascularization of the blastodisc was evident and the eyes  appeared as dark spots. Heart beats were observed in most embryos by  the fifteenth day but were evident in a few as early as the tenth day.  The pulse of a fifteen-day-old embryo averaged 72 beats per minute at  a temperature of 30 degrees. Embryos at fifteen days, measured in a  straight line from cephalic flexure to posteriormost portion of body,  were approximately nine to ten millimeters long and at 22 days were 14  millimeters long. At approximately 35 days the eggs became dark red;  embryonic structures were discernible thereafter only in eggs that had  embryos situated at one end, close to the shell.    Incubation periods for 49 eggs (representing 12 clutches) kept in the  laboratory ranged from 56 to 127 days, depending on the temperature of  the air during the incubation period. In 1955, eggs were kept at my  home in Lawrence where air temperatures were uncomfortably hot in  summer and fluctuations of 20 degrees (Fahrenheit) or more in a  24-hour period were common. The following summer eggs were kept in my  office at the Museum where temperatures were but slightly cooler than  in my home and subject also to wide variation. In 1957 this part of  the Museum was air-conditioned and kept at approximately 75 degrees.  The greater lengths of incubation periods at lower temperatures are  shown in Table 1. Risley (1933:698) found the incubation period of  _Sternotherus odoratus_ to be longer at lower temperatures;  corresponding observations were made by Allard (1935:332) and Driver  (1946:173) on the eggs of _Terrapene carolina_. Cagle (1950:40) and  Cunningham (1939) found no distinct differences in length of  incubation period for eggs of _Pseudemys scripta_ and _Malaclemys  terrapin_, respectively, at different temperatures within the range  tolerated by the eggs.    Most nests observed in the field were in open situations where they  would receive the direct rays of the sun for at least part of the day;  the shorter average incubation periods (59 and 70 days, respectively),  observed in 1955 and 1956, therefore, more nearly reflect the time of  incubation under natural conditions than does the excessively long  period (125 days at 75 degrees) observed in 1957 under cooler, more  nearly even temperatures.

Even in years when summer temperatures are  much cooler than normal, eggs probably hatch by the end of October.  Hatchlings or eggs would have a poor chance of surviving a winter in  nests on exposed cut-banks or in other unprotected situations.  Overwintering in the nest, hatchlings might survive more often than  eggs, since hatchlings could burrow into the walls and floor of the  nest cavity. Unsuitable environmental conditions that delay the  nesting season and retard the rate of embryonic development may, in  some years, be important limiting factors on populations of ornate box  turtles.    In areas where _T. ornata_ and _T. carolina_ are sympatric (for  example, in Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri) the two species occupy  different habitats, _ornata_ preferring open grassland and _carolina_  wooded situations. Under natural conditions, the average incubation  periods of these two species can be expected to differ, _T. carolina_  having a somewhat longer period due to lower temperatures in nests  that are shaded. In the light of these speculations, the remark of  Cahn (1937:102)--that _T. ornata_ nested later in the season (in  Illinois) and compensated for this by having a shorter incubation  period--is understandable.    The range of temperatures tolerated by developing eggs probably varies  with the stage of embryonic development. When temperatures in the  laboratory were 102 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately eight  hours, due to a defect in a thermostat, the young in two eggs of _T.  ornata_, that had begun to hatch on the previous day, were killed, as  were the nearly full-term embryos in a number of eggs of _T. carolina_  (southern Mississippi) kept in the same container. A five-day-old  hatchling of _T. ornata_, kept in the same container, survived the  high temperatures with no apparent ill effects. Cagle (1950:41) found  that eggs of _Pseudemys scripta_ could not withstand temperatures of  10 degrees for two weeks nor would they survive if incubated at 40  degrees. Cunningham (1939) reported that eggs of _Malaclemys terrapin_  could not survive prolonged exposure to temperatures of 35 to 40.6  degrees but tolerated temporary exposure to temperatures as high as  46 degrees.    In the summer of 1955, a clutch of three eggs, all of which contained  nearly full-term embryos, was placed in a refrigerator for 48 hours.  The temperature in the refrigerator was maintained at approximately  4.5 degrees; maximum and minimum temperatures for the 48 hour period  were 2.8 and 9.5 degrees, respectively. When the eggs were removed  from the refrigerator they showed gains in weight and increases in  size comparable to eggs, containing embryos of the same age, used as  controls. The experimental eggs began to hatch two days after they  were removed to normal temperatures--approximately 24 hours later than  the controls.    In the late stages of incubation, the outer layer of the shell becomes  brittle and is covered with a mosaic of fine cracks or is raised into  small welts. Several days before hatching, movements of the embryo  disturb the surface of the shell and cause the outer layer to crumble  away, especially where the head and forequarters of the embryo lie  against the shell. Some embryos could be seen spasmodically thrusting  the head and neck dorsally against the shell.    The role of the caruncle in opening the shell seems to vary among  different species of turtles. Cagle (1950:41) reported that it was  used only occasionally by _Pseudemys scripta_; Allard (1935:332)  thought that it was not used by _Terrapene carolina_; and, the  observations of Booth (1958:262) and Grant (1936:228) indicate that  embryos of _Gopherus agassizi_ use the caruncle at least in the  initial"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#9)"],[1,"are the hams and part  of the viscera from the coelomic cavity. In one case where a wolf was  interrupted while feeding it was apparent that the animal had been  stripping the omental fat from the carcass. This may be the wolf's  favorite part of a deer, for the stomach of one wolf that we examined  in January 1967 contained nothing but such fat.    The average consumption and kill rate of deer by wolves has not yet  been determined, but we have some information bearing on the subject.  Because our data were obtained during a winter of unusually deep snow,  and it was obvious that wolves were killing more deer than they could  eat at the moment (see Mech _et al._, page 51), our figures should be  considered much higher than average. However, they should be useful in  that they probably represent the maximum kill rate not only throughout  the year but also throughout a period of many years.    By observing each of our radiotagged wolves whenever possible and  noting whether or not it was feeding on a kill, we learned that our  wolves generally remained close to their kills for periods of from 1 to  7 days, depending on how recently they had eaten (fig. 32). Thus, when  a wolf was found at a new location each day, the assumption could be  made that the animal did not currently have a kill.    [Illustration: _Figure 32.--Periods spent by radiotagged wolves and  their associates feeding on kills judged to be their own. This does not  include periods when they were known to be feeding on carrion._]    We assumed that wolves found at fresh kills (fig. 33) had made them  unless there was evidence to the contrary as with 1053, the scavenger.  When a wolf was found at one location for several consecutive days but  could not be observed, we assumed it was feeding on a kill, since  whenever wolves were observed remaining in the same location for  several days they were seen feeding. Thus a range of possible number of  kills per wolf was determined, with the lower limit being the known  minimum and the upper limit the possible maximum. When more than one  wolf fed on a kill, as with the pack, the figures were calculated on a  per-wolf basis.    [Illustration: _Figure 33.--Radiotagged wolf (upper left) found at kill  (lower right). (Photo courtesy of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    In this way we obtained data on a total of 468 wolf-days and found a  total kill of 35 to 48 deer (table 7). This averages out to a kill rate  of one deer per 10 to 14 days per wolf. The figure varied considerably  among individuals--1051 had the highest rate of one kill per 6.3 to 7.2  days, and each wolf in 1059's pack had the lowest rate (except for  1053, the scavenger) of one deer per 14.0 to 18.0 days.    It is significant that the pack of five wolves had a lower kill rate  per wolf than did single wolves and pairs. This is explainable because  the ability of wolves to kill deer during early 1969 was much greater  than usual (see Mech _et al._, p. 51). Thus single wolves probably  could kill deer just as easily as could packs, but they did not need to  share them. This differs markedly from the situation on Isle Royale,  where lone wolves usually feed only on moose remains left by packs  (Mech 1966a, Jordan _et al._ 1967).    That lone wolves had more of a food surplus than those in the pack is  confirmed by the figures on the average number of days that the various  wolves fed on kills (table 7). Wolf 1051 spent an average of only 2.2  to 2.4 days feeding at each of his kills, whereas 1059's pack of five  spent an average of 5.8 to 7.5 wolf-days at each kill. Further  confirmation is found in the fact that even when most wolves were  leaving their kills partly uneaten, a pack of 8 to 10 wolves (probably  that to which 1057 belonged) was seen completely devouring a kill.      _Table 7.--Kill rate of deer by radiotagged wolves and their associates_    #: _Number_    --------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   Wolf-days  Wolf                     Wolf-days         Wolf-days   Wolf-days  feeding   #      Wolves   Dates    of data   Kills  per kill[14] feeding   per kill  --------------------------------------------------------------------------            #                 #        #      Mean #       #        Mean #    1051      1   Nov. 26 to   101     14-16    6.3-7.2    33-40      2.2-2.4                Apr. 3    1053[15]  1   Dec. 14 to    75      2-3    25.0-37.5    9-18      4.5-6.0                Mar. 27    1055    1-2   Jan. 9 to     61      4-9     6.7-15.0   13-25      2.8-3.3                Mar. 14    1057    1-13  Jan. 24 to    51      5-7     7.3-10.2   25-33      4.7-5.0                Feb. 28    1059      5   Jan. 25 to   180     10-13   14.0-18.0     75       5.8-7.5                Mar. 14  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Summary  22   Nov. 27 to   468     35-48 [16]9.8-13.4  145-181 [17]3.8-4.1                Apr. 3                  Before       142      7-9 [18]15.7-20.3  39-56       5.1-5.6                Feb. 1                  After        326     28-39     8.4-11.6  106-125     3.2-3.8                Jan. 31  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    FOOTNOTES:    [14] Kill rate per wolf.    [15] Figures for this animal are so low because she was basically a  scavenger.    [16] Average kill rate per wolf for all radiotagged wolves and their  associates, derived by dividing total number of wolf-days by total  number of kills.    [17] Average number of days that each wolf spent at each kill, derived  by dividing total number of wolf-days spent feeding by the total number  of kills.    [18] This figure probably is the closest to the actual kill rate during  most winters.      Therefore it is probable that the kill rate per wolf for members of the  pack of five is much closer to the usual average winter kill rate. It  can still be considered higher than the usual winter rate, however,  because this pack also was leaving some of its kills partly uneaten.    A reasonable approximation of the average kill rate during most winters  would be the rate found for our radiotagged wolves before February 1,  because the relations among the wolves, the deer, and the snow during  that period were not unlike those of most winters. The average kill  rate per wolf before February 1 was estimated at one deer per 15.7 to  20.3 days.    After this period, the rate increased to about one deer per 8.4 to 11.6  days, and an estimated 50 percent of the available food was left  uneaten (see Mech _et al._, page 51). This implies that the kill rate  during February and March was about twice as high as usual. On this  basis, the usual kill rate would be estimated at one deer per 16.8 to  23.2 days, which checks well with the rate found before February (one  deer per 15.7 to 20.3 days). Thus we feel that an estimated kill rate  of about one deer per 18 days per wolf is a close approximation of the  average kill rate for most winters. This is about 50 percent less than  the kill rate of one deer per 4 days estimated by Stenlund (1955) for  two packs of three wolves (one deer per 12 days per wolf). However, it  compares favorably with the actual kill rate of one deer per wolf per  17.6 days found for a pack of eight wolves in Ontario.[19]    Once the average rate of kill is known, the average food consumption  per wolf can be calculated. The average deer (considering both fawns  and adults) from the Superior National Forest during winter weighs  about 113 pounds (calculated from Erickson _et al._ 1961), and an  arbitrary 13 pounds can be deducted from this for inedible portions.  This leaves 100 pounds of deer per wolf per 18 days, or 5.6 pounds per  wolf per day. This figure is much less than the 10 to 14 pounds  estimated consumption rate for wolves feeding on moose on Isle Royale  (Mech 1966a). However, much variation can be expected in an animal  whose physiology must be adapted to a feast-or-famine existence.    Wolves can be maintained in captivity on 2.5 pounds of meat per day,  and large active dogs (_Canis familiaris_) require 3.7 pounds per day,  so it is likely that the minimum daily requirement for wolves in the  wild is about 4.0 pounds per day (Mech 1970). This figure agrees well  with the estimated consumption rate for our study area.    FOOTNOTES:    [19] _Kolenosky, G. B. Wolf movements, activities and predation impact  on a wintering deer population in East-Central Ontario. (Manuscript in  preparation for publication.)_      Relative Population Density    Censusing wolves in a 1.5-million-acre study area is a difficult task,  and we have no direct information on which to base a population  estimate. However, some deductions can be made about the relative  population densities in our study area between the period 1948 to 1953  and the period of the present study, 1967 to 1969.    R. A. Rausch (1967a) hypothesized that the frequency of large packs is  higher when population density is high, and presented evidence  supporting this idea. On this assumption, a comparison of pack-size  distributions between various periods can indicate relative population  densities between periods. The advantage of this method is that it  eliminates the usual type of year-to-year biases in wolf censuses such  as might result from differences in precise census route, type of  aircraft, skill of observers, and other conditions. Only a difference  that would cause a bias in the _size_ of the packs seen would be of  importance.    Therefore, we tested the difference in size distributions of population  units between the 1948-53 study period and the present period (table  1), using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test (Siegel 1956). The  average \"pack\" size in the earlier years was 2.8, compared with 4.2 at  present; thus pack sizes are significantly larger at present (95  percent level). This "]]]
