OEDIPUS  What is the site, to what god dedicate?    STRANGER  Inviolable, untrod; goddesses,  Dread brood of Earth and Darkness, here abide.    OEDIPUS  Tell me the awful name I should invoke?    STRANGER  The Gracious Ones, All-seeing, so our folk  Call them, but elsewhere other names are rife.    OEDIPUS  Then may they show their suppliant grace, for I  From this your sanctuary will ne'er depart.    STRANGER  What word is this?    OEDIPUS                      The watchword of my fate.    STRANGER  Nay, 'tis not mine to bid thee hence without  Due warrant and instruction from the State.    OEDIPUS  Now in God's name, O stranger, scorn me not  As a wayfarer; tell me what I crave.    STRANGER  Ask; your request shall not be scorned by me.    OEDIPUS  How call you then the place wherein we bide?    STRANGER  Whate'er I know thou too shalt know; the place  Is all to great Poseidon consecrate.  Hard by, the Titan, he who bears the torch,  Prometheus, has his worship; but the spot  Thou treadest, the Brass-footed Threshold named,  Is Athens' bastion, and the neighboring lands  Claim as their chief and patron yonder knight  Colonus, and in common bear his name.  Such, stranger, is the spot, to fame unknown,  But dear to us its native worshipers.    OEDIPUS  Thou sayest there are dwellers in these parts?    STRANGER  Surely; they bear the name of yonder god.    OEDIPUS  Ruled by a king or by the general voice?    STRANGER  The lord of Athens is our over-lord.    OEDIPUS  Who is this monarch, great in word and might?    STRANGER  Theseus, the son of Aegeus our late king.    OEDIPUS  Might one be sent from you to summon him?    STRANGER  Wherefore?  To tell him aught or urge his coming?    OEDIPUS  Say a slight service may avail him much.    STRANGER  How can he profit from a sightless man?    OEDIPUS  The blind man's words will be instinct with sight.    STRANGER  Heed then; I fain would see thee out of harm;  For by the looks, marred though they be by fate,  I judge thee noble; tarry where thou art,  While I go seek the burghers--those at hand,  Not in the city.  They will soon decide  Whether thou art to rest or go thy way.  [Exit STRANGER]    OEDIPUS  Tell me, my daughter, has the stranger gone?    ANTIGONE  Yes, he has gone; now we are all alone,  And thou may'st speak, dear father, without fear.    OEDIPUS  Stern-visaged queens, since coming to this land  First in your sanctuary I bent the knee,  Frown not on me or Phoebus, who, when erst  He told me all my miseries to come,  Spake of this respite after many years,  Some haven in a far-off land, a rest  Vouchsafed at last by dread divinities.  \"There,\" said he, \"shalt thou round thy weary life,  A blessing to the land wherein thou dwell'st,  But to the land that cast thee forth, a curse.\"  And of my weird he promised signs should come,  Earthquake, or thunderclap, or lightning flash.  And now I recognize as yours the sign  That led my wanderings to this your grove;  Else had I never lighted on you first,  A wineless man on your seat of native rock.  O goddesses, fulfill Apollo's word,  Grant me some consummation of my life,  If haply I appear not all too vile,  A thrall to sorrow worse than any slave.  Hear, gentle daughters of primeval Night,  Hear, namesake of great Pallas; Athens, first  Of cities, pity this dishonored shade,  The ghost of him who once was Oedipus.    ANTIGONE  Hush! for I see some grey-beards on their way,  Their errand to spy out our resting-place.    OEDIPUS  I will be mute, and thou shalt guide my steps  Into the covert from the public road,  Till I have learned their drift.  A prudent man  Will ever shape his course by what he learns.  [Enter CHORUS]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Ha!  Where is he?  Look around!  Every nook and corner scan!  He the all-presumptuous man,  Whither vanished? search the ground!  A wayfarer, I ween,  A wayfarer, no countryman of ours,  That old man must have been;  Never had native dared to tempt the Powers,            Or enter their demesne,  The Maids in awe of whom each mortal cowers,            Whose name no voice betrays nor cry,            And as we pass them with averted eye,  We move hushed lips in reverent piety.            But now some godless man,                 'Tis rumored, here abides;            The precincts through I scan,                 Yet wot not where he hides,                      The wretch profane!                      I search and search in vain.    OEDIPUS            I am that man; I know you near            Ears to the blind, they say, are eyes.    CHORUS            O dread to see and dread to hear!    OEDIPUS  Oh sirs, I am no outlaw under ban.    CHORUS  Who can he be--Zeus save us!--this old man?    OEDIPUS  No favorite of fate,  That ye should envy his estate,  O, Sirs, would any happy mortal, say,  Grope by the light of other eyes his way,  Or face the storm upon so frail a stay?    CHORUS  (Ant. 1)  Wast thou then sightless from thy birth?  Evil, methinks, and long  Thy pilgrimage on earth.  Yet add not curse to curse and wrong to wrong.            I warn thee, trespass not            Within this hallowed spot,  Lest thou shouldst find the silent grassy glade            Where offerings are laid,  Bowls of spring water mingled with sweet mead.            Thou must not stay,            Come, come away,            Tired wanderer, dost thou heed?  (We are far off, but sure our voice can reach.)            If aught thou wouldst beseech,  Speak where 'tis right; till then refrain from speech.    OEDIPUS  Daughter, what counsel should we now pursue?    ANTIGONE  We must obey and do as here they do.    OEDIPUS  Thy hand then!    ANTIGONE                 Here, O father, is my hand,    OEDIPUS  O Sirs, if I come forth at your command,  Let me not suffer for my confidence.    CHORUS  (Str. 2)  Against thy will no man shall drive thee hence.    OEDIPUS  Shall I go further?    CHORUS                      Aye.    OEDIPUS                           What further still?    CHORUS  Lead maiden, thou canst guide him where we will.

OEDIPUS  Guide me child, where we may range  Safe within the paths of right;  Counsel freely may exchange  Nor with fate and fortune fight.    CHORUS  (Ant. 2)  Halt!  Go no further than that rocky floor.    OEDIPUS  Stay where I now am?    CHORUS                      Yes, advance no more.    OEDIPUS  May I sit down?    CHORUS                 Move sideways towards the ledge,  And sit thee crouching on the scarped edge.    ANTIGONE  This is my office, father, O incline--    OEDIPUS  Ah me! ah me!    ANTIGONE  Thy steps to my steps, lean thine aged frame on mine.    OEDIPUS  Woe on my fate unblest!    CHORUS  Wanderer, now thou art at rest,  Tell me of thy birth and home,  From what far country art thou come,  Led on thy weary way, declare!    OEDIPUS  Strangers, I have no country.  O forbear--    CHORUS  What is it, old man, that thou wouldst conceal?    OEDIPUS  Forbear, nor urge me further to reveal--    CHORUS  Why this reluctance?    OEDIPUS                      Dread my lineage.    CHORUS                                          Say!    OEDIPUS  What must I answer, child, ah welladay!    CHORUS  Say of what stock thou comest, what man's son--    OEDIPUS  Ah me, my daughter, now we are undone!    ANTIGONE  Speak, for thou standest on the slippery verge.    OEDIPUS  I will; no plea for silence can I urge.    CHORUS  Will neither speak?  Come, Sir, why dally thus!    OEDIPUS  Know'st one of Laius'--    CHORUS                           Ha?  Who!    OEDIPUS  Seed of Labdacus--    CHORUS                      Oh Zeus!    OEDIPUS  The hapless Oedipus.    CHORUS                      Art he?    OEDIPUS  Whate'er I utter, have no fear of me.

OEDIPUS  How keep you then your troth?    CHORUS  Heaven's justice never smites  Him who ill with ill requites.  But if guile with guile contend,  Bane, not blessing, is the end.  Arise, begone and take thee hence straightway,  Lest on our land a heavier curse thou lay.    ANTIGONE       O sirs! ye suffered not my father blind,       Albeit gracious and to ruth inclined,       Knowing the deeds he wrought, not innocent,            But with no ill intent;            Yet heed a maiden's moan            Who pleads for him alone;            My eyes, not reft of sight,  Plead with you as a daughter's might  You are our providence,  O make us not go hence!  O with a gracious nod  Grant us the nigh despaired-of boon we crave?            Hear us, O hear,  But all that ye hold dear,  Wife, children, homestead, hearth and God!  Where will you find one, search ye ne'er so well.  Who 'scapes perdition if a god impel!    CHORUS  Surely we pity thee and him alike  Daughter of Oedipus, for your distress;  But as we reverence the decrees of Heaven  We cannot say aught other than we said.    OEDIPUS  O what avails renown or fair repute?  Are they not vanity?  For, look you, now  Athens is held of States the most devout,  Athens alone gives hospitality  And shelters the vexed stranger, so men say.  Have I found so?  I whom ye dislodged  First from my seat of rock and now would drive  Forth from your land,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],[0,"Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#9)"],[1," Park.    A study of the effect of rodents on plants used by deer was initiated in  1956 by Harold R. Shepherd. Three acres were fenced in a fashion  designed to exclude rodents but not deer. An adjacent three acres were  fenced as a control, but not so as to exclude rodents or deer. Eight  trap lines nearby provide an index of rodent fluctuations from year to  year. These studies will need to be continued for a period of ten years  or more, and should provide much information concerning not only deer  but also rodents and their effect on vegetation.      Cervus canadensis nelsoni V. Bailey Wapiti    Wapiti are seen periodically; probably they wander in from the higher  mountains to the northeast and do not remain for long. The following  note was included in the 1921 report of Mr. Jesse L. Nusbaum, then  Superintendent of the Park: \"The first elk ever seen in the Park made  his appearance near the head of Navajo Canyon, August 15 of this year,  and travelled for two miles in front of a Ford car down the main road  before another car, travelling in the opposite direction, scared him  into the timber.\" Additional observations have been recorded as follows:  School Section Canyon (\"fall\" 1935), Knife Edge Road (July, 1940), West  Soda Canyon and Windy Point (December, 1949), Long Canyon (July, 1959),  and Park Entrance (December, 1959). Three of the six observations are in  July and August; therefore movement by wapiti into the Park can not be  attributed entirely to disturbance during the hunting season.      Ovis canadensis canadensis Shaw Bighorn    Some early records of the bighorn were mentioned by C.W. Quaintance  (1935): In a letter of January 20, 1935, John Wetherill said that a  \"Mountain Sheep Canyon\" (now Rock Canyon) was named for a bunch of sheep  that wintered near their camp; and Sam Ahkeah, a Navajo, says the  Indians occasionally find remnants of sheep on the Mesa, which they take  back to their hogans. Cahalane (1948:257) reported that hunting  presumably had eliminated bighorns from the Mesa by 1896; however Jean  Pinkley reports that a large ram was killed on Point Lookout in 1906.    On January 30, 1946, 14 sheep (3 rams, 7 ewes, and 4 lambs) from the  herd at Tarryall, Colorado, were obtained through the Colorado  Department of Game and Fish and were released at 8:30 a.m. at the edge  of the canyon south of Spruce Tree Lodge. The sheep, instead of entering  the canyon as expected, turned north, passed behind the museum, and  eventually disappeared northward on Chapin Mesa. The sheep evidently  divided into at least two bands. On April 24, 1946, three sheep were  seen 2-1/2 mi. N of Rock Springs, and on June 19, 1947, tracks were seen  in Mancos Canyon. In 1947, 1948, and 1949 farmers in Weber Canyon  reported seeing sheep many times on Weber Mountain, and watering at the  Mancos River. In May, 1949, an estimate of 27 sheep on Weber Mountain  was made after several days study by men from the state game department.  The herds continued to increase. In 1956 I saw two bighorns. On August  18, at 6:20 a.m., my wife and I briefly observed a bighorn on the rocks  below Square Tower Ruins. On August 24, I was digging with a small  shovel in rocky soil behind the cabin at Rock Springs, when hoof beats  were heard approaching in the rocky head of the canyon to the east. An  adult ewe came up to the fence around the cabin area and looked at me,  seemingly curious about the noise my shovel had been producing. I  remained motionless and called to my wife, Justine, to come from the  cabin and see the sheep. The ewe seemed not to be disturbed by my voice,  but took flight, returning in the direction from which she had come, the  moment Justine appeared from behind the cabin. Sheep can now be seen on  occasion in any of the deep canyons across the southern half of the  Park. The sheep have caused slight damage in some of the ruins by  bedding down there, and by climbing on walls. As the sheep increase in  numbers this activity may be regarded as a problem. In 1959 an estimated  75 to 100 sheep were in the Park and adjacent areas.          DISCUSSION      The distributions of animals are influenced by geographic, vegetational,  and altitudinal factors. The Mesa Verde is intermediate in geographic  position and altitude between the high Southern Rocky Mountains and the  low southwestern desert. For this reason, we find on the Mesa Verde (1)  a preponderance of species having wide distributions in this part of the  country, and having relatively wide ranges of tolerance for different  habitats, (2) a lesser number of exclusively montane or boreal species  than occur in the higher mountains to the northeast of the Mesa and that  may reach the limits of their ranges here, and (3) a small number of  species of southern or Sonoran affinities. Fifty-four species are  recorded above.    Forty-one of these species are represented by specimens from the Park.  Thirteen additional species in the list have been seen in the Park.    On the Grand Mesa, which is more elevated than, and some 110 miles north  of, the Mesa Verde (see Figure 1), 55 per cent of the species of mammals  have boreal affinities and the other 45 per cent are wide-spread species  (Anderson, 1959:414). Boreal species from the Mesa Verde are _Sorex  vagrans_, _Sylvilagus nuttallii_, _Spermophilus lateralis_, _Marmota  flaviventris_, _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_, _Microtus montanus_, and  _Microtus longicaudus_. These seven species comprise only thirteen per  cent of the mammalian fauna of the Mesa Verde. Other boreal species that  occur in the mountains of Colorado on the Grand Mesa or elsewhere  (Findley and Anderson, 1956:80) and that do not occur on the Mesa Verde  are _Sorex cinereus_, _Sorex palustris_, _Ochotona princeps_, _Lepus  americana_, _Clethrionomys gapperi_, _Phenacomys intermedius_, _Zapus  princeps_, _Martes americana_, _Mustela erminea_, and _Lynx canadensis_.  The 47 species from the Mesa Verde that are not exclusively boreal make  up 87 per cent of the mammalian fauna. Most of these are wide-spread  species and are more abundant in the deserts or other lowlands than in  the coniferous forests of the highlands, for example the eight species  of bats, and _Sylvilagus audubonii_, _Thomomys bottae_, _Taxidea taxus_,  _Bassariscus astutus_, _Canis latrans_, _Cynomys gunnisoni_,  _Reithrodontomys megalotis_, and _Lepus californicus_. A few of the  wide-spread species are more common in the highlands than in the  lowlands, for example _Ursus americanus_, _Felis concolor_, _Castor  canadensis_, _Erethizon dorsatum_, and _Cervus canadensis_, and the  ranges of three of these, the bear, mountain lion and wapiti, are more  restricted today than formerly. A few species find their favorite  habitat and reach their greatest abundance in altitudinally and  vegetationally intermediate areas such as upon the Mesa Verde, or in  special habitats, such as the rock ledges, and crevices that are so  abundant on the Mesa. Examples of this group of species are  _Spermophilus variegatus_, _Peromyscus crinitus_, _Peromyscus truei_,  _Neotoma cinerea_, and _Neotoma mexicana_. One species, _Dipodomys  ordii_, is restricted to the desert. Species that are restricted to the  desert and that occur in Montezuma County, Colorado, but that are not  known from the Mesa Verde are _Ammospermophilus leucurus_, _Perognathus  flavus_, and _Onychomys leucogaster_.    Species known to have changed in numbers in the past 50 years are the  mule deer that has increased, and the prairie dog that has decreased.  Possibly beaver have increased along the Mancos River. The muskrat,  mink, beaver, and raccoon usually occur only along the Mancos River, as  there is no other permanent surface water in the Park.    Species such as the bighorn and the marmot that are rare within the  Park, or those such as the chickaree, the prairie dog, the wandering  shrew, the montane vole, and the long-tailed vole that occupy only small  areas of suitable habitat within the Park are the species most likely to  be eliminated by natural changes, or through the activities of man. For  example parasites introduced through domestic sheep that wander into the  range of bighorns within the Park might endanger the bighorn population.  An increase in grazing activity, road building, and camping in Prater  and Morfield canyons might eliminate the small areas of habitat occupied  by the montane vole and the wandering shrew. Fire in Chickaree Draw  could destroy all the Douglas fir there, and consequently much of the  habitat occupied by the chickaree.    Probably some species inhabit the Mesa that have not yet been found, but  they are probably few, and their discovery will not alter the faunal  pattern in which the few boreal species occupy restricted habitats in  the higher parts of the Mesa, and a preponderance of geographically  wide-spread species occupy all or most of the Mesa, and surrounding  areas. Additional bats are the species most likely to be added to the  list.      28-7577          LITERATURE CITED    ANDERSON, S.  1959. Mammals of the Grand Mesa, Colorado. Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus.  Nat.
