The above is an extract from the REV. H. G. WATKINS'S _Hints to Heads of  Families_, a work well deserving the attentive consideration of  inexperienced housekeepers.    [26-*] The greatest care should be taken by the man of fashion, that his  cook's health be preserved: one hundredth part of the attention usually  bestowed on his dog, or his horse, will suffice to regulate her animal  system.    \"Cleanliness, and a proper ventilation to carry off smoke and steam,  should be particularly attended to in the construction of a kitchen; the  grand scene of action, the fire-place, should be placed where it may  receive plenty of light; hitherto the contrary has prevailed, and the  poor cook is continually basted with her own perspiration.\"--_A. C.,  Jun._    \"The most experienced artists in cookery cannot be certain of their work  without tasting: they must be incessantly tasting. The spoon of a good  cook is continually passing from the stewpan to his tongue; nothing but  frequent tasting his sauces, ragouts, &c. can discover to him what  progress they have made, or enable him to season a soup with any  certainty of success; his palate, therefore, must be in the highest  state of excitability, that the least fault may be perceived in an  instant.    \"But, alas! the constant empyreumatic fumes of the stoves, the necessity  of frequent drinking, and often of bad beer, to moisten a parched  throat; in short, every thing around him conspires quickly to vitiate  the organs of taste; the palate becomes blunted; its quickness of  feeling and delicacy, on which the sensibility of the organs of taste  depends, grows daily more obtuse; and in a short time the gustatory  nerve becomes quite unexcitable.    \"IF YOU FIND YOUR COOK NEGLECT HIS BUSINESS--that his _ragouts_ are too  highly spiced or salted, and his cookery has too much of the '_haut  gout_,' you may be sure that _his index of taste_ wants regulating; his  palate has lost its sensibility, and it is high time to call in the  assistance of the apothecary.    \"'_Purger souvent_' is the grand maxim in all kitchens where _le Maitre  d'Hotel_ has any regard for the reputation of his table. _Les Bons  Hommes de Bouche_ submit to the operation without a murmur; to bind  others, it should be made the first condition in hiring them. Those who  refuse, prove they were not born to become masters of their art; and  their indifference to fame will rank them, as they deserve, among those  slaves who pass their lives in as much obscurity as their own stewpans.\"    To the preceding observations from the \"_Almanach des Gourmands_,\" we  may add, that the _Mouthician_ will have a still better chance of  success, if he can prevail on his master to observe the same _regime_  which he orders for his cook; or, instead of endeavouring to awaken an  idle appetite by reading the index to a cookery book, or an additional  use of the pepper-box and salt-cellar, rather seek it from abstinence or  exercise;--the philosophical _gourmand_ will consider that the edge of  our appetite is generally keen, in proportion to the activity of our  other habits; let him attentively peruse our \"PEPTIC PRECEPTS,\" &c.  which briefly explain the art of refreshing the gustatory nerves, and of  invigorating the whole system. See in the following chapter on  INVITATIONS TO DINNER--A recipe to make FORTY PERISTALTIC PERSUADERS.    [27-*] \"She must be quick and strong of sight; her hearing most acute,  that she may be sensible when the contents of her vessels bubble,  although they be closely covered, and that she may be alarmed before the  pot boils over; her auditory nerve ought to discriminate (when several  saucepans are in operation at the same time) the simmering of one, the  ebullition of another, and the full-toned wabbling of a third.    \"It is imperiously requisite that her organ of smell be highly  susceptible of the various effluvia, that her nose may distinguish the  perfection of aromatic ingredients, and that in animal substances it  shall evince a suspicious accuracy between tenderness and putrefaction;  above all, her olfactories should be tremblingly alive to mustiness and  empyreuma.    \"It is from the exquisite sensibility of her palate, that we admire and  judge of the cook; from the alliance between the olfactory and sapid  organs, it will be seen that their perfection is indispensable.\"--_A.  C., Jun._    [28-*] A facetious _gourmand_ suggests that the old story of \"lighting a  candle to the devil,\" probably arose from this adage--and was an  offering presented to his infernal majesty by some epicure who was in  want of a cook.    [29-*] \"A gentlewoman being at table, abroad or at home, must observe to  keep her body straight, and lean not by any means with her elbows, nor  by ravenous gesture discover a voracious appetite: talk not when you  have _meat_ in your _mouth_; and do not smack like _a pig_, nor venture  to eat _spoonmeat_ so hot that the tears stand in your eyes, which is as  unseemly as the _gentlewoman_ who pretended to have as little a  _stomach_ as she had a _mouth_, and therefore would not swallow her  _pease_ by spoonfuls; but took them one by one, and cut them in two  before she would eat them. It is very uncomely to drink so large a  _draught_ that your _breath_ is almost gone--and are forced to blow  strongly to recover yourself--throwing down your _liquor_ as into a  _funnel_ is an action fitter for a juggler than a _gentlewoman_: thus  much for your observations in general; if I am defective as to  particulars, your own _prudence, discretion, and curious observations_  will supply.\"    \"In CARVING at your own _table_, distribute the best pieces first, and  it will appear very comely and decent to use a _fork_; so touch no piece  of _meat_ without it.\"    \"_Mem._ The English are indebted to TOM CORYAT for introducing THE FORK,  for which they called him _Furcifer_.\"--See his _Crudities_, vol. i. p.  106.--Edit. 1776, 8vo.    [30-*] \"Almost all arts and sciences are more or less encumbered with  vulgar errors and prejudices, which avarice and ignorance have  unfortunately sufficient influence to preserve, by help (or hindrance)  of mysterious, undefinable, and not seldom unintelligible, technical  terms--Anglice, nicknames--which, instead of enlightening the subject it  is professedly pretended they were invented to illuminate, serve but to  shroud it in almost impenetrable obscurity; and, in general, so  extravagantly fond are the professors of an art of keeping up all the  pomp, circumstance, and mystery of it, and of preserving the accumulated  prejudices of ages past undiminished, that one might fairly suppose  those who have had the courage and perseverance to overcome these  obstacles, and penetrate the veil of science, were delighted with  placing difficulties in the way of those who may attempt to follow them,  on purpose to deter them from the pursuit, and that they cannot bear  others should climb the hill of knowledge by a readier road than they  themselves did: and such is _l'esprit de corps_, that as their  predecessors supported themselves by serving it out _gradatim et  stillatim_, and retailing with a sparing hand the information they so  hardly obtained, they find it convenient to follow their example: and,  willing to do as they have been done by, leave and bequeath the  inheritance undiminished to those who may succeed them.\"--See p. 10 of  Dr. KITCHINER _on Telescopes_, 12mo. 1825, printed for Whittaker, Ave  Maria Lane.    [32-*] \"In the present language of cookery, there has been a woful  departure from the simplicity of our ancestors,--such a farrago of  unappropriate and unmeaning terms, many corrupted from the French,  others disguised from the Italian, some misapplied from the German,  while many are a disgrace to the English. What can any person suppose to  be the meaning of _a shoulder of lamb in epigram_, unless it were a poor  dish, for a pennyless poet? _Aspect of fish_, would appear calculated  for an astrologer; and _shoulder of mutton surprised_, designed for a  sheep-stealer.\"--_A. C., Jun._    [33-*] See note to No. 59 how to plump the liver of a goose.    [33-+] \"It is a curious illustration of the _de gustibus non eat  disputandum_, that the ancients considered the _swan_ as a high  delicacy, and abstained from the flesh of the _goose_ as impure and  indigestible.\"--MOUBRAY _on Poultry_, p. 36.          INVITATIONS TO DINNER      In \"the affairs of the mouth\" the strictest punctuality is  indispensable; the GASTRONOMER ought to be as accurate an observer of  time, as the ASTRONOMER. The least delay produces fatal and irreparable  misfortunes.    Almost all other ceremonies and civil duties may be put off for several  hours without much inconvenience, and all may be postponed without  absolute danger. A little delay may try the patience of those who are  waiting; but the act itself will be equally perfect and equally valid.  Procrastination sometimes is rather advantageous than prejudicial. It  gives time for reflection, and may prevent our taking a step which would  have made us miserable for life; the delay of a courier has prevented  the conclusion of a convention, the signing of which might have  occasioned the ruin of a nation.    If, from affairs the most important, we descend to our pleasures and  amusements, we shall find new arguments in support of our assertions.  The putting off of a rendezvous, or a ball, &c. will make them the more  delightful. To _hope_ is to _enjoy_.        \"Man never is, but always to be blest.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#9)"],[1," escaped back  under the ship's stern.    The Greek took both tiller and sheet and continued the chase around  the _Lancashire Queen_, while I attended to Charley, on whose head a  nasty lump was rapidly rising. Our sailor audience was wild with  delight, and to a man encouraged the fleeing Italians. Charley sat up,  with one hand on his head, and gazed about him sheepishly.    \"It will never do to let them escape now,\" he said, at the same time  drawing his revolver.    On our next circuit, he threatened the Italians with the weapon; but  they rowed on stolidly, keeping splendid stroke and utterly  disregarding him.    \"If you don't stop, I'll shoot,\" Charley said menacingly.    [Illustration: \"I suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron.\"]    But this had no effect, nor were they to be frightened into  surrendering even when he fired several shots dangerously close to  them. It was too much to expect him to shoot unarmed men, and this  they knew as well as we did; so they continued to pull doggedly round  and round the ship.    \"We'll run them down, then!\" Charley exclaimed. \"We'll wear them out  and wind them!\"    So the chase continued. Twenty times more we ran them around the  _Lancashire Queen_, and at last we could see that even their iron  muscles were giving out. They were nearly exhausted, and it was only a  matter of a few more circuits, when the game took on a new feature. On  the row to windward they always gained on us, so that they were  half-way down the ship's side on the row to leeward when we were  passing the bow. But this last time, as we passed the bow, we saw them  escaping up the ship's gangway, which had been suddenly lowered. It  was an organized move on the part of the sailors, evidently  countenanced by the captain; for by the time we arrived where the  gangway had been, it was being hoisted up, and the skiff, slung in the  ship's davits, was likewise flying aloft out of reach.    The parley that followed with the captain was short and snappy. He  absolutely forbade us to board the _Lancashire Queen_, and as  absolutely refused to give up the two men. By this time Charley was as  enraged as the Greek. Not only had he been foiled in a long and  ridiculous chase, but he had been knocked senseless into the bottom of  his boat by the men who had escaped him.    \"Knock off my head with little apples,\" he declared emphatically,  striking the fist of one hand into the palm of the other, \"if those  two men ever escape me! I'll stay here to get them if it takes the  rest of my natural life, and if I don't get them, then I promise you  I'll live unnaturally long or until I do get them, or my name's not  Charley Le Grant!\"    And then began the siege of the _Lancashire Queen_, a siege memorable  in the annals of both fishermen and fish patrol. When the _Reindeer_  came along, after a fruitless pursuit of the shad fleet, Charley  instructed Neil Partington to send out his own salmon boat, with  blankets, provisions, and a fisherman's charcoal stove. By sunset this  exchange of boats was made, and we said good-by to our Greek, who  perforce had to go into Benicia and be locked up for his own  violation of the law. After supper, Charley and I kept alternate  four-hour watches till daylight. The fishermen made no attempt to  escape that night, though the ship sent out a boat for scouting  purposes to find if the coast were clear.    By the next day we saw that a steady siege was in order, and we  perfected our plans with an eye to our own comfort. A dock, known as  the Solano Wharf, which ran out from the Benicia shore, helped us in  this. It happened that the _Lancashire Queen_, the shore at Turner's  Shipyard, and the Solano Wharf were the corners of a big equilateral  triangle. From ship to shore, the side of the triangle along which the  Italians had to escape, was a distance equal to that from the Solano  Wharf to the shore, the side of the triangle along which we had to  travel to get to the shore before the Italians. But as we could sail  much faster than they could row, we could permit them to travel about  half their side of the triangle before we darted out along our side.  If we allowed them to get more than half-way, they were certain to  beat us to shore; while if we started before they were half-way, they  were equally certain to beat us back to the ship.    We found that an imaginary line, drawn from the end of the wharf to a  windmill farther along the shore, cut precisely in half the line of  the triangle along which the Italians must escape to reach the land.  This line made it easy for us to determine how far to let them run  away before we bestirred ourselves in pursuit. Day after day we would  watch them through our glasses as they rowed leisurely along toward  the half-way point; and as they drew close into line with the  windmill, we would leap into the boat and get up sail. At sight of our  preparation, they would turn and row slowly back to the _Lancashire  Queen_, secure in the knowledge that we could not overtake them.    To guard against calms--when our salmon boat would be useless--we also  had in readiness a light rowing skiff equipped with spoon-oars. But at  such times, when the wind failed us, we were forced to row out from  the wharf as soon as they rowed from the ship. In the night-time, on  the other hand, we were compelled to patrol the immediate vicinity of  the ship; which we did, Charley and I standing four-hour watches turn  and turn about. The Italians, however, preferred the daytime in which  to escape, and so our long night vigils were without result.    \"What makes me mad,\" said Charley, \"is our being kept from our honest  beds while those rascally lawbreakers are sleeping soundly every  night. But much good may it do them,\" he threatened. \"I'll keep them  on that ship till the captain charges them board, as sure as a  sturgeon's not a catfish!\"    It was a tantalizing problem that confronted us. As long as we were  vigilant, they could not escape; and as long as they were careful, we  would be unable to catch them. Charley cudgelled his brains  continually, but for once his imagination failed him. It was a problem  apparently without other solution than that of patience. It was a  waiting game, and whichever waited the longer was bound to win. To add  to our irritation, friends of the Italians established a code of  signals with them from the shore, so that we never dared relax the  siege for a moment. And besides this, there were always one or two  suspicious-looking fishermen hanging around the Solano Wharf and  keeping watch on our actions. We could do nothing but \"grin and bear  it,\" as Charley said, while it took up all our time and prevented us  from doing other work.    The days went by, and there was no change in the situation. Not that  no attempts were made to change it. One night friends from the shore  came out in a skiff and attempted to confuse us while the two Italians  escaped. That they did not succeed was due to the lack of a little oil  on the ship's davits. For we were drawn back from the pursuit of the  strange boat by the creaking of the davits, and arrived at the  _Lancashire Queen_ just as the Italians were lowering their skiff.  Another night, fully half a dozen skiffs rowed around us in the  darkness, but we held on like a leech to the side of the ship and  frustrated their plan till they grew angry and showered us with abuse.  Charley laughed to himself in the bottom of the boat.    \"It's a good sign, lad,\" he said to me. \"When men begin to abuse, make  sure they're losing patience; and shortly after they lose patience,  they lose their heads. Mark my words, if we only hold out, they'll get  careless some fine day, and then we'll get them.\"    But they did not grow careless, and Charley confessed that this was  one of the times when all signs failed. Their patience seemed equal to  ours, and the second week of the siege dragged monotonously along.  Then Charley's lagging imagination quickened sufficiently to suggest  a ruse. Peter Boyelen, a new patrolman and one unknown to the  fisher-folk, happened to arrive in Benicia, and we took him into our  plan. We were as secret as possible about it, but in some unfathomable  way the friends ashore got word to the beleaguered Italians to keep  their eyes open.    On the night we were to put our ruse into effect, Charley and I took  up our usual station in our rowing skiff alongside the _Lancashire  Queen_. After it was thoroughly dark, Peter Boyelen came out in a  crazy duck boat, the kind you can pick up and carry away under one  arm. When we heard him coming along, paddling noisily, we slipped away  a short distance into the darkness and rested on our oars. Opposite  the gangway, having jovially hailed the anchor-watch of the  _Lancashire Queen_ and asked the direction of the _Scottish Chiefs_,  another wheat ship, he awkwardly capsized himself. The man who was  standing the anchor-watch ran down the gangway and hauled him out of  the water. This was what he wanted, to get aboard the ship; and the  next thing he expected was to be taken on deck and then below to warm  up and dry out. But the captain inhospitably kept him perched on the  lowest gangway step, shivering miserably and with his feet dangling in  the water, till we, out of very pity, rowed in from the darkness and  took him off. The jokes and gibes of the awakened crew sounded  anything but sweet in our ears, and even the two Italians climbed up  on the rail and laughed down at us long and maliciously.    \"That's all right,\" Charley said in a low voice, which I only could  hear. \"I'm mighty glad it's not us that's laughing first. We'll save  our laugh to the end, eh, lad?\"    He clapped a hand on my shoulder as he finished, but it seemed to me  that there was more determination than hope in his voice.    It would have been possible for us to secure the aid of United States  marshals and board the English ship, backed "]]]
