[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#9)"],[1,"    A similar condition is sometimes found, as an abnormality, in  man, which presents itself under the following aspect (Fig.  20): an osseous prominence more or less long, in the shape of a  crochet-needle--supra-epitrochlear process--situated 5 or 6 centimetres  above the epitrochlea; the summit of this process gives attachment to a  fibrous band, which is inserted by its other end into the epitrochlea  and the internal intermuscular aponeurosis. The fibro-osseous ring thus  formed gives passage to the brachial artery and the median nerve, or in  case of a premature division of this artery to the ulnar branch of the  same.[9]      [9] For further details of this anomaly, see Testut, 'The Epitrochlear        Process in Man' (_International Journal of Anatomy and        Physiology_, 1889); A. Nicolas, 'New Studies on the Supratrochlear        Process in Man' (_Review of Biology of the North of France_, t.        iii., 1890-1891).    There is also found in some mammals a perforation of the thin plate of  bone which, in others, separates the olecranon fossa from the coronoid.  This perforation is sometimes found as an abnormality in the human  humerus.    As does the sternum and the skeleton of the shoulder, the humerus of  birds presents differences correlated to the functions which the  thoracic limbs are destined to fulfil. Lying on the side of the thorax,  directed obliquely downwards and backwards (Fig. 21), it is  proportionately longer in individuals of powerful flight than in those  which fly less or not at all. In the vulture it projects beyond the  posterior part of the pelvis; in the cock it does not even reach the  anterior border of the same. To these differences in length are added  differences in volume and in the development of the processes which  serve for muscular attachment, which are more considerable in birds of  powerful flight.    The humerus is so placed that the radial border, external in man and  quadrupeds, looks upwards, with the result that the surface of the bone  of the arm, which in these latter is anterior, in the former looks  outwards. The humeral head, which is turned forwards and a little  inwards, is convex and elongated in the vertical direction. Behind and  above this head is found a crest for the insertion of muscles. It is the  same for the region below, where there is a tuberosity whose inferior  surface presents a pretty large opening which looks inwards to a fossa  from the floor of which a number of minute openings communicate with the  interior of the bone. This is the pneumatic foramen of the humerus.    It is of interest to remember in connection with this subject that in  birds, in keeping with the conditions of flight, every system of organs  is adapted to diminish the weight of the body. We particularly draw  attention to the osseous framework, the structure of which is such that  the weight of the animal is greatly lessened. This condition is secured  by the pneumaticity. The bone consists of a cover of compact tissue,  which, instead of enclosing marrow, is hollowed out by cavities which  contain air, and communicate with special pouches, the air-sacs, which  are appendages of the lungs.[10]      [10] The presence of air in the bones does not seem to be always         associated with the power of flight; as a matter of fact, we find         air spaces in the bones of some birds which do not fly (E. J.         Marey, 'The Flight of Birds,' Paris, 1890, p. 51).    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--SKELETON OF A BIRD (VULTURE): LEFT SURFACE.    1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, cervical vertebrae; 4, spinous processes of the  dorsal vertebrae; 5, coccygeal vertebrae; 6, sternum; 7, keel; 8, superior  ribs; 9, inferior ribs; 10, clavicle; 11, coracoid bone (for the details  of the skeleton of the shoulder, see Fig. 18); 12, humerus; 13, radius;  14, ulna; 15, carpus; 16, hand (for details of the skeleton of this  region, see Fig. 31); 17, ilium; 18, ischium; 19, pubis (for the details  of the pelvis, see Fig. 46); 20, femur; 21, tibia; 22, fibula; 23,  osseous nodule, which some anatomists think represents the calcaneum; it  is the sole vestige of the tarsus; 24, metatarsus; 25, foot; 26, first  toe (for the details of the skeleton of the foot, see Fig. 48).]    The antibrachial extremity of the humerus is flattened from without  inwards. It terminates in two articular surfaces, which articulate with  the radius and ulna.    The olecranon process of the ulna being slightly developed, it follows  that the olecranon fossa is not large; neither is the coronoid.      General View of the Form of the Forearm and Hand    We now proceed to the study of the two regions of the fore-limbs which  present the greatest variety in regard to the number of bones and also  in regard to form and proportions. These two regions are the forearm and  the hand.    It is first of all necessary to say that in man, when the fore-limb  hangs beside the body, and the dorsum of the hand looks backwards, the  two bones of the forearm are parallel, and that this position is known  by the name of _supination_. It is also necessary to remember that there  is another attitude, in which the radius, crossing the ulna, and  carrying the hand with it, displaces the latter in such a way that the  palmar surface looks backwards. This second position is known as  _pronation_.    Let us now suppose that a man wishes to walk in the attitude of a  quadruped. It will be necessary, in order that his upper limbs, being  for the moment anterior ones, may act as members of support, to place  the forearm in pronation, in order that, as is more normal, the hands  may rest on the ground by their palmar surfaces. In this position the  radius, being rotated on its own axis at its upper extremity and around  the ulna in the rest of its extent, shall have its inferior extremity  situated on the inner side of the corresponding extremity of the latter.    Such is the situation of the bones of the forearm and the attitude of  the hand in quadrupeds. In short, quadrupeds have their anterior members  in the position of pronation.    The individual whom we have just supposed placed in the attitude of a  quadruped would be able to maintain this position by pressing on the  ground more or less extensive portions of his hands; the whole palm of  the hand may be applied to the ground (Fig. 22); or the fingers  only--that is to say, the phalanges (Fig. 23); or the extremities of  the fingers only--that is to say, the third phalanges (Fig. 24). This  last position, which is certainly difficult to maintain, should here be  regarded rather as theoretical.    We shall meet with each of these modes of support in certain groups of  animals. Thus, the bear, badger, and the majority of rodents, have the  paws applied to the ground by the whole extent of the palmar surface of  the hand, from the wrist to the tips of the fingers. They are therefore  called plantigrade, from the analogy, in this case, of the palm of the  hand to the plantar surface, or sole of the foot.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING FOR ITS WHOLE EXTENT ON  ITS PALMAR SURFACE: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.]    In others, such as the lion, tiger, panther, cat, wolf, and fox, the  support is made no longer on the whole extent of the palmar surface, but  on the corresponding surface of the fingers only--the metacarpus is  turned back, and, consequently, the wrist--that is to say, the  carpus--is removed from the ground. These are the digitigrades.    Lastly, the ruminants (sheep, oxen, deer, etc.), and also the pig, ass,  and horse, rest on the third phalanx only. In them not only is the  metacarpus turned back, but also the two first phalanges. The wrist is  very far removed from the ground. In these animals, the third phalanx is  enclosed in a case of horn, a nail (the hoof), and because the support  of the limb is on that nail, the name of unguligrades has been given  them. Nevertheless, as the point of support is on the third phalanx,  which is also known by the name of phalangette, we are of opinion that,  in order to specify definitely, although they walk on their fingers, as  do the digitigrades, the support is provided not by the whole extent of  those appendages, they might receive the name of phalangettigrades.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING ON ITS PHALANGES: LEFT  SIDE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.]    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--THE HUMAN HAND RESTING ON THE TIPS OF SOME OF  ITS THIRD PHALANGES: LEFT SIDE, EXTERNAL VIEW.]    It is necessary among the ruminants to make an exception of the camel  and the llama, which are digitigrades.    Just in proportion as the hand is raised from the ground, as we have  just seen in passing from the plantigrades to the digitigrades and  unguligrades, the number of bones of that region diminishes, the bones  of the forearm coalesce, and the ulna tends to disappear; the hand  becomes less and less suitable for grasping, climbing, or digging, so as  to form an organ exclusively adapted for walking and supporting the  body.    Thus, the bear (plantigrade) has five digits, and the power of  performing the movements of supination and pronation. Indeed, we know  with what facility this animal is able to move his paws in every  direction, and climb a tree by grasping it with his fore-limbs. It is  well known, however, that no animal except the ape can perform the  movements of rotation of the radius around the ulna with the same  facility as man; and that none possesses the same degree of suppleness,  extent, and variety of movements of the forearm and hand.    In the digitigrades there is one finger which is but slightly developed,  and which is always removed from the ground--that is, the thumb: there  is also a little less mobility of the radius around the ulna.    In the ungulates the limbs are simply required to perform the movements  of walking, and form veritable columns of support, which become the more  solid as they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#9)"],[1," told, and where they pointed Googarh and his  wives waded into the stream. Finding she was getting out of her depth,  Cookooburrah the laughing jackass cried out: \"Goug gour gah gah. Goug  gour gah gah. Give me a stick. Give me a stick.\"    But from the bank her sons only answered in derision: \"Goug gour gah  gah. Goug gour gah gah.\" And the three hunters were soon engulfed in  the rushing stream, drawn down by the current and drowned.          12.  THE MAYAMAH      The blacks had all left their camp and gone away to attend a borah.  Nothing was left in the camp but one very old dog, too old to travel.  After the blacks had been gone about three days, one night came their  enemies, the Gooeeays, intending to surprise them and kill them.    Painted in all the glory of their war-paint came the Gooeeays, their  hair tied in top-knots and ornamented with feathers and kangaroos'  teeth. Their waywahs of paddy, melon, and kangaroo rat skins cut in  strips, round their waists, were new and strong, holding firmly some of  their boomerangs and woggoorahs, which they had stuck through them.    But prepared as they were for conquest, they found only a deserted camp  containing naught but one old dog. They asked the old dog where the  blacks were gone. But he only shook his head. Again and again they  asked him, and again and again he only shook his head. At last some of  the black fellows raised their spears and their moorillahs or  nullah-nullahs, saying:    \"If you do not tell us where the blacks are gone, we shall kill you.\"    Then spoke the old dog, saying only: \"Gone to the borah.\"    And as he spoke every one of the Gooeeays and everything they had with  them was turned to stone. Even the waywahs round their waists, the  top-knots on their heads, and the spears in their hands, even these  turned to stone. And when the blacks returned to their camp long  afterwards, when the borah was over, and the boys, who had been made  young men, gone out into the bush to undergo their novitiate, each with  his solitary guardian, then saw the blacks, their enemies, the  Gooeeays, standing round their old camp, as if to attack it. But  instead of being men of flesh, they were men of stone--they, their  weapons, their waywahs, and all that belonged to them, stone.    And at that place are to be found stones or mayamahs of great beauty,  striped and marked and coloured as were the men painted.    And the place of the mayamah is on one of the mounts near Beemery.          13.  THE BUNBUNDOOLOOEYS      The mother Bunbundoolooey put her child, a little boy Bunbundoolooey,  who could only just crawl, into her goolay. Goolay is a sort of small  netted hammock, slung by black women on their backs, in which they  carry their babies and goods in general. Bunbundoolooey, the pigeon,  put her goolay across her back, and started out hunting.    When she had gone some distance she came to a clump of bunnia or wattle  trees. At the foot of one of these she saw some large euloomarah or  grubs, which were good to cat. She picked some up, and dug with her yam  stick round the roots of the tree to get more. She went from tree to  tree, getting grubs at every one. That she might gather them all, she  put down her goolay, and hunted further round.    Soon in the excitement of her search, she forgot the goolay with the  child in it, and wandered away. Further and further she went from the  Dunnia clump, never once thinking of her poor birrahlee, or baby. On  and still on she went, until at length she reached a far country.    The birrablee woke up, and crawled out of the goolay. First he only  crawled about, but soon he grew stronger, and raised himself, and stood  by a tree. Then day by day he grew stronger and walked alone, and  stronger still he grew, and could run. Then he grew on into a big boy,  and then into a man, and his mother he never saw while he was growing  from birrahlee to man.    But in the far country at length one day Bunbundoolooey, the mother,  remembered the birrablee she had left.    \"Oh,\" she cried, \"I forgot my birrahlee. I left my birrablee where the  Dunnias grow in a far country. I must go to my birrahlee. My poor  birrahlee! I forgot it. Mad must I have been when I forgot him. My  birrahlee! My birrahlee!\"    And away went the mother as fast as she could travel back to the Dunnia  clump in the far country. When she reached the spot she saw the tracks  of her birrablee, first crawling, then standing, then walking, and then  running. Bigger and bigger were the tracks she followed, until she saw  they were the tracks of a man. She followed them until she reached a  camp. No one was in the camp, but a fire was there, so she waited, and  while waiting looked round. She saw her son had made himself many  weapons, and many opossum rugs, which he had painted gaily inside.    Then at last she saw a man coming towards the camp, and she knew he was  her birrahlee, grown into a man. As he drew near she ran out to meet  him, saying:    \"Bunbundoolooey, I am your mother. The mother who forgot you as a  birrahlee, and left you. But now I have come to find you, my son. Long  was the journey, my son, and your mother was weary, but now that she  sees once more her birrahlee, who has grown into a man, she is no  longer weary, but glad is her heart, and loud could she sing in her  joy. Ah, Bunbundoolooey, my son! Bunbundoolooey, my son!\"    And she ran forward with her arms out, as if to embrace him.    But stern was the face of Bunbundoolooey, the son, and no answer did he  make with his tongue. But he stooped to the ground and picked therefrom  a big stone. This swiftly he threw at his mother, hitting her with such  force that she fell dead to the earth.    Then on strode Bunbundoolooey to his camp.          14.  OONGNAIRWAH AND GUINAREY      Oongnairwah, the diver, and Guinarey, the eagle hawk, told all the  pelicans, black swans, cranes, and many others, that they would take  their net to the creek and catch fish, if some of them would go and  beat the fish down towards the net.    Gladly went the pelicans, black swans, and the rest to the creek. In  they jumped, and splashed the water about to scare the fish down  towards where Oongnairwah and Guinarey were stationed with their net.  Presently little Deereeree, the wagtail, and Burreenjin, the peewee,  who were on the bank sitting on a stump, called out, \"Look out, we saw  the back of an alligator in the water.\" The diver and eagle hawk called  back, \"Go away, then. The wind blows from you towards him. Go back or  he will smell you.\"    But Deereeree and Burreenjin were watching the fishing and did not heed  what was said to them. Soon the alligator smelt them, and he lashed out  with his tail, splashing the water so high, and lashing so furiously,  that all the fishermen were drowned, even Deereeree and Burreenjin on  the bank--not one escaped, And red was the bank of the creek, and red  the stump whereon Deereeree and Burreenjin had sat, with the blood of  the slain. And the place is called Goomade and is red for ever.          15.  NARAHDARN THE BAT      Narahdarn, the bat, wanted honey. He watched until he saw a  Wurranunnah, or bee, alight. He caught it, stuck a white feather  between its hind legs, let it go and followed it. He knew he could see  the white feather, and so follow the bee to its nest. He ordered his  two wives, of the Bilber tribe, to follow him with wirrees to carry  home the honey in. Night came on and Wurranunnah the bee had not  reached home. Narahdarn caught him, imprisoned him under bark, and kept  him safely there until next morning. When it was light enough to see,  Narahdarn let the bee go again, and followed him to his nest, in a  gunnyanny tree. Marking the tree with his comebo that he might know it  again, he returned to hurry on his wives who were some way behind. He  wanted them to come on, climb the tree, and chop out the honey. When  they reached the marked tree one of the women climbed up. She called  out to Narahdarn that the honey was in a split in the tree. He called  back to her to put her hand in and get it out. She put her arm in, but  found she could not get it out again. Narahdarn climbed up to help her,  but found when he reached her that the only way to free her was to cut  off her arm. This he did before she had time to realise what he was  going to do, and protest. So great was the shock to her that she died  instantly. Narahdarn carried down her lifeless body and commanded her  sister, his other wife, to go up, chop out the arm, and get the honey.  She protested, declaring the bees would have taken the honey away by  now.    \"Not so,\" he said; \"go at once.\"    Every excuse she could think of, to save herself, she made. But her  excuses were in vain, and Narahdarn only became furious with her for  making them, and, brandishing his boondi, drove her up the tree. She  managed to get her arm in beside her sister's, but there it stuck and  she could not move it. Narahdarn, who was watching her, saw what had  happened and followed her up the tree. Finding he could not pull her  arm out, in spite of her cries, he chopped it off, as he had done her  sister's. After one shriek, as he drove his comebo through her arm, she  was silent. He said, \"Come down, and I will chop out the bees' nest.\"  But she did not answer him, and he saw that she too was dead. Then he  was frightened, and climbed quickly down the gunnyanny tree; taking her  body to the ground with him, he laid it beside her sister's, and  quickly he hurried from the spot, taking no further thought of the  honey. As he neared his camp, two little sisters of his wives ran out  to meet him, thinking their sisters would be with him, and that they  would give them a taste of the honey they knew they had gone out to  get. But to their surprise Narahdarn came alone, and as he drew near to  them they saw his arms were covered with blood. And his face had a  fierce look on it, which"]]]
