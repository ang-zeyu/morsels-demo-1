[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#9)"],[1,"we hanged our  harps.\" Thus sang the Psalmist of the sorrows of the exiles in Babylon,  and his song has fastened the name of the great and wicked city upon one  of the most familiar willows, while also making it \"weep\"; for the  common weeping willow is botanically named _Salix Babylonica_.    It may be that the forlorn Jews did hang their harps upon the tree we  know as the weeping willow, that species being credited to Asia as a  place of origin; but it is open to doubt, for the very obvious reason  that the weeping willow is distinctly unadapted to use as a harp-rack,  and one is at a loss to know just how the instruments in question would  have been hung thereon. It is probable that the willows along the rivers  of Babylon were of other species, and that the connection of the city  of the captivity and the tears of the exiles with the long, drooping  branches of the noble tree which has thus been sorrowfully named was a  purely sentimental one. Indeed, the weeping willow is also called  Napoleon's willow, because the great Corsican found much pleasure in a  superb willow of the same species which stood on the lonely prison isle  of St. Helena, and from twigs of which many trees in the United States  have been grown.    The willow family presents great contrasts, both physical and  sentimental. It is a symbol both of grief and of grace. The former  characterization is undoubtedly because of the allusion of the one  hundred and thirty-seventh Psalm, as quoted above, thoughtlessly  extended through the centuries; and the latter, as when a beautiful and  slender woman is said to be of \"willowy\" form, obviously because of the  real grace of the long, swinging wands of the same tree. I might hint  that a better reason for making the willow symbolize grief is because  charcoal made from its twigs and branches is an important and almost  essential ingredient of gunpowder, through which a sufficiency of grief  has undoubtedly entered the world!    Willow twigs seem the very essence of fragility, as they break from the  parent tree at a touch; and yet one of the willows furnishes the tough,  pliable and enduring withes from which are woven the baskets of the  world. The willows, usually thin in branch, sparse of somewhat pale  foliage, of so-called mournful mien, are yet bursting with vigor and  life; indeed, the spread and the value of the family is by reason of  this tenacity and virility, which makes a broken twig, floating on the  surface of a turbid stream, take root and grow on a sandy bank where  nothing else can maintain itself, wresting existence and drawing  strength and beauty from the very element whose ravages of flood and  current it bravely withstands.    Apparently ephemeral in wood, growing quickly and perishing as quickly,  the willows nevertheless supply us with an important preservative  element, extracted from their bitter juices. Salicylic acid, made from  willow bark, prevents change and arrests decay, and it is an important  medical agent as well.    [Illustration: A weeping willow in early spring]    Flexible and seemingly delicate as the little tree is when but just  established, there is small promise of the rugged and sturdy trunk that  in a few years may stand where the chance twig lodged. And the color of  the willows--ah! there's a point for full enthusiasm, for this family of  grief furnishes a cheerful note for every month in the year, and runs  the whole scale of greens, grays, yellows and browns, and even adds to  the winter landscape touches of blazing orange and bright red across the  snow. Before ever one has thought seriously of the coming of spring, the  long branchlets of the weeping willow have quickened into a hint of  lovely yellowish green, and those same branchlets will be holding their  green leaves against a wintry blast when most other trees have given up  their foliage under the frost's urgency. Often have the orange-yellow  twigs of the golden osier illumined a somber countryside for me as I  looked from the car window; and close by may be seen other willow bushes  of brown, green, gray, and even purple, to add to the color compensation  of the season. Then may come into the view, as one flies past, a great  old weeping willow rattling its bare twigs in the wind; and, if a stream  is passed, there are sure to be seen on its banks the sturdy trunks of  the white and the black willows at least. Think of an average landscape  with the willows eliminated, and there will appear a great vacancy not  readily filled by another tree.    The weeping willow has always made a strong appeal to me, but never one  of simple grief or sorrow. Its expression is rather of great dignity,  and I remember watching in somewhat of awe one which grew near my  childhood's home, as its branches writhed and twisted in a violent  rain-storm, seeming then fairly to agonize, so tossed and buffeted were  they by the wind. But soon the storm ceased, the sun shone on the  rounded head of the willow, turning the raindrops to quickly vanishing  diamonds, and the great tree breathed only a gentle and benignant peace.  When, in later years, I came to know the moss-hung live-oak of the  Southland, the weeping willow assumed to me a new dignity and value in  the northern landscape, and I have strongly resented the attitude of a  noted writer on \"Art Out of Doors\" who says of it: \"I never once have  seen it where it did not hurt the effect of its surroundings, or at  least, if it stood apart from other trees, where some tree of another  species would not have looked far better.\" One of the great merits of  the tree, its difference of habit, its variation from the ordinary, is  thus urged against it.    [Illustration: The weeping willow in a storm]    I have spoken of the basket willow, which is scientifically _Salix  viminalis_, and an introduction from Europe, as indeed are many of the  family. In my father's nursery grew a great patch of basket willows,  annually cut to the ground to make a profusion of \"sprouts,\" from which  were cut the \"tying willows\" used to bind firmly together for shipment  bundles of young trees. It was an achievement to be able to take a  six-foot withe, and, deftly twisting the tip of it under the heel to a  mass of flexible fiber, tie this twisted portion into a substantial  loop; and to have this novel wooden rope then endure the utmost pull of  a vigorous man, as he braced his feet against the bundle of trees in  binding the withe upon it, gave an impression of anything but weakness  on the part of the willow.    Who has not admired the soft gray silky buds of the \"pussy\" willow,  swelling with the spring's impulse, and ripening quickly into a \"catkin\"  loaded with golden pollen? Nowadays the shoots of this willow are  \"forced\" into bud by the florists, and sold in the cities in great  quantities; but really to see it one must find the low tree or bush by a  stream in the woods, or along the roadside, with a chance to note its  fullness of blossom. It is finest just when the hepaticas are at their  bluest on the warm hillsides; and, one sunny afternoon of a spring  journey along the north branch of the Susquehanna river, I did not know  which of the two conspicuous ornaments of the deeply wooded bank made me  most anxious to jump from the too swiftly moving train.    This pussy-willow has pleasing leaves, and is a truly ornamental shrub  or small tree which will flourish quite well in a dry back yard, as I  have reason to know. One bright day in February I found a pussy-willow  tree, with its deep purple buds showing not a hint of the life within.  The few twigs brought home quickly expanded when placed in water, and  gave us their forecast of the spring. One twig was, out of curiosity,  left in the water after the catkins had faded, merely to see what would  happen. It bravely sent forth leaves, while at the base little white  rootlets appeared. Its vigor appealing to us, it was planted in an arid  spot in our back yard, and it is now, after a year and a half, a  handsome, slender young tree that will give us a whole family of silken  pussy-buds to stroke and admire another spring.    [Illustration: A pussy-willow in a park]    This same little tree is called also the glaucous willow, and it is  botanically _Salix discolor_. It is more distinct than some others of  the family, for the willow is a great mixer. The tree expert who will  unerringly distinguish between the red oak and the scarlet oak by the  precise angle of the spinose margins of the leaves (how I admire an  accuracy I do not possess!) will balk at which is crack willow, or white  willow, or yellow or blue willow. The abundant vigor and vitality and  freedom of the family, and the fact that it is of what is known as the  dioecious habit--that is, the flowers are not complete, fertile and  infertile flowers being borne on separate trees--make it most ready to  hybridize. The pollen of the black willow may fertilize the flower of  the white willow, with a result that certainly tends to grayness on the  worrying head of the botanist who, in after years, is trying to locate  the result of the cross!    [Illustration: Blossoms of the white willow]    There is much variety in the willow flowers--and I wonder how many  observers really notice any other willow \"blossoms\" than those of the  showy pussy? A superb spring day afield took me along a fascinatingly  crooked stream, the Conodoguinet, whose banks furnish a congenial and as  yet protected (because concealed from the flower-hunting vandal) home  for wild flowers innumerable and most beautiful, as well as trees that  have ripened into maturity. An earlier visit at the time the bluebells  were ringing out their silent message on the hillside, in exquisite  beauty, with the lavender phlox fairly carpeting the woods, gave a  glimpse of some promising willows on the other side of the stream.  Twilight and letters to sign--how hateful the desk and its work seem in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#9)"],[1,"had encouraged the  Israelites to take up the conflict, with the words: \"Up to war, I shall  deliver them into your hands.\" After the tribes had again and again  suffered defeat, they recognized the intention of God, to betray  them as a punishment for their sins. They therefore ordained a day  of fasting and convocation before the holy Ark, and Phinehas the  son of Eleazar entreated God in their behalf: \"What means this,  that Thou leadest us astray? Is the deed of the Benjamites right in  Thine eyes? Then why didst Thou not command us to desist from  the combat? But if what our brethren have done is evil in Thy  sight, then why dost Thou cause us to fall before them in battle? O  God of our fathers, hearken unto my voice. Make it known this day  unto Thy servant whether the war waged with Benjamin is  pleasing in Thine eyes, or whether thou desirest to punish Thy  people for its sins. Then the sinners among us will amend their  ways. I am mindful of what happened in the days of my youth, at  the time of Moses. In the zeal of my soul I slew two for the sin of  Zimri, and when his well-wishers sought to kill me, Thou didst  send an angel, who cut off twenty-four thousand of them and  delivered me. But now eleven of Thy tribes have gone forth to do  Thy bidding, to avenge and slay, and, lo, they have themselves  been slain, so that they are made to believe that Thy revelations  are lying and deceitful. O Lord, God of our forefathers, naught is  hidden before Thee. Make it manifest why this misfortune has  overtaken us.\"    God replied to Phinehas at great length, setting forth why eleven  tribes had suffered so heavily. The Lord had wanted to punished  them for having permitted Micah and his mother Delilah to pursue  their evil ways undisturbed, though they were zealous beyond  measure in avenging the wrong done to the woman at Gibeah. As  soon as all those had perished who were guilty of having aided and  abetted Micah in his idolatrous practices, whether directly or  indirectly, God was willing to help them in their conflicts with the  Benjamites.    So it came. In the battle fought soon after, seventy-five thousand  Benjamites fell slain. Only six hundred of the tribe survived. (134)  Fearing to remain in Palestine, the small band emigrated to Italy  and Germany. (135)    At the same time the punishment promised them by God overtook  the two chief sinners. Micah lost his life by fire, and his mother  rotted alive; worms crawled from her body. (136)    In spite of the great mischief caused by Micah, he had one good  quality, and God permitted it to plead for him when the angel  stood up against him as his accusers. He was extremely hospitable.  His house always stood wide open to the wanderer, and to his  hospitality he owed it that he was granted a share in the future  world. (137) In hell Micah is the first in the sixth division, which  is under the guidance of the angel Hadriel, and he is the only one  in the division who is spared hell tortures. (138) Micah's sons was  Jeroboam, whose golden calves were sinful far beyond anything  his father had done. (139)    In those days God spake to Phinehas: \"Thou art one hundred and  twenty years old, thou hast reached the natural term of man's life.  Go now, betake thyself to the mountain Danaben, and remain there  many years. I will command the eagles to sustain thee with food,  so that thou returnest not to men until the time when thou lockest  fast the clouds and openest them again. Then I will carry thee to  the place where those are who were before thee, and there thou  wilt tarry until I visit the world, and bring thee thither to taste of  death.\" (140)    ELKANAH AND HANNAH    The period of the Judges is linked to the period of the Kingdom by  the prophet Samuel, who anointed both Saul and David as kings.  Not only was Samuel himself a prophet, but his forebears also has  been prophets, (1) and both his parents, Elkanah and Hannah, were  endowed with the gift of prophecy. (2) Aside from this gift,  Elkanah possessed extraordinary virtue. He was a second  Abraham, the only pious man of his generation, who saved the  world from destruction when God, made wroth by the idolatry of  Micah, was on the point of annihilating it utterly. (3) His chief  merit was that he stimulated the people by his example to go on  pilgrimages to Shiloh, the spiritual centre of the nation.  Accompanied by his whole household, including kinsmen, he was  in the habit of making the three prescribed pilgrimages annually,  and though he was a man of only moderate means, (4) his retinue  was equipped with great magnificence. In all the towns through  which it passed, the procession caused commotion. The lookers-on  invariably inquired into the reason of the rare spectacle, and  Elkanah told them: \"We are going to the house of the Lord at  Shiloh, for thence come forth the law. Why should you not join  us?\" Such gentle, persuasive words did not fail of taking effect. In  the first year five households undertook the pilgrimage, the next  year ten, and so on until the whole town followed his example.  Elkanah chose a new route every year. Thus he touched at many  towns, and their inhabitants were led to do a pious deed. (5)    In spite of his God-fearing ways, Elkanah's domestic life was not  perfectly happy. He had been married ten years, and his union with  Hannah had not been blessed with offspring. (6) The love he bore  his wife compensated him for his childlessness, but Hannah herself  insisted upon his taking a second wife. Peninnah embraced every  opportunity of vexing Hannah. In the morning her derisive greeting  to Hannah would be: \"Dost thou not mean to rise and wash thy  children, and send them to school?\" (7) Such jeers were to keep  Hannah mindful of her childlessness. Perhaps Peninnah's  intentions were laudable: she may have wanted to bring Hannah to  the point of praying to God for children. (8) However it may have  been forced from her, Hannah's petition for a son was fervent and  devout. She entreats God: \"Lord of the world! Hast Thou created  aught in vain? Our eyes Thou hast destined for sight, our ears for  hearing, our mouth for speech, our nose to smell therewith, our  hands for work. Didst Thou not create these breasts above my  heart to give suck to a babe? (9) O grant me a son, that he may  draw nourishment therefrom. Lord, Thou reignest over all beings,  the mortal and the heavenly beings. The heavenly beings neither  eat nor drink, they do not propagate themselves, nor do they die,  but they live forever. Mortal man eats, drinks, propagates his kind  and dies. If, now, I am of the heavenly beings, let me live forever.  But if I belong to mortal mankind, let me do my part in  establishing the race.\" (10)    Eli the high priest, who at first misinterpreted Hannah's long  prayer, dismissed her with the blessing: \"May the son to be born  unto thee acquire great knowledge in the law.\" (11) Hannah left  the sanctuary, and at once her grief-furrowed countenance  changes. She felt beyond a doubt that the blessing of Eli would be  fulfilled. (12)     THE YOUTH OF SAMUEL    Hannah's prayer was heard. At the end of six months and a few  days (13) Samuel was born to her, in the nineteenth year of her  married life, (14) and the one hundred and thirtieth of her age. (15)  Samuel was of a frail constitution, (16) and required tender care  and nurture. For this reason he and his mother could not  accompany Elkanah on his pilgrimages. Hannah withheld her boy  from the sanctuary for some years. Before Samuel's birth a voice  from heaven had proclaimed that in a short time a great man  would be born, whose name would be Samuel. All men children of  that time were accordingly named Samuel. As they grew up, the  mothers were in the habit of getting together and telling of their  children's doings, in order to determine which of them satisfied the  expectations the prophecy had aroused. When the true Samuel was  born, and by his wonderful deed excelled all his companions, it  became plain to whom the word of God applied. (17) His  preeminence now being undisputed, Hannah was willing to part  with him.    The following incident is an illustration of Samuel's unusual  qualities manifested even in infancy. He was two years old when  his mother brought him to Shiloh to leave him there permanently.  An occasion at once presented itself for the display of his learning  and acumen, which were so great as to arouse the astonishment of  the high priest Eli himself. On entering the sanctuary Samuel  noticed that they were seeking a priest to kill the sacrificial  animal. Samuel instructed the attendants that a non-priest was  permitted to kill the sacrifice. The high priest Eli appeared at the  moment when, by Samuel's directions, the sacrifice was being  killed by a non-priest. Angered by the child's boldness, he was  about to have him executed, regardless of Hannah's prayer for his  life. \"Let him die,\" (18) he said, \"I shall pray for another in his  place.\" Hannah replied: \"I lent him to the Lord. Whatever betide,  he belongs neither to thee nor to me, but to God.\" (19) Only then,  after Samuel's life was secure, Hannah offered up her prayer of  thanksgiving. Beside the expression of her gratitude, it contains  also many prophecies regarding Samuel's future achievements, and  it recited the history of Israel from the beginning until the advent  of Messiah. (20) Her prayer incidentally brought relief to the Sons  of Korah. Since the earth had swallowed them, they had been  constantly sinking lower and lower. When Hannah uttered the  words, \"God bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up,\" (21) they  came to a standstill in their downward course.    Hannah was spared to witness, not only the greatness of her son,  but also the undoing of her rival. Every time Hannah bore a child,  Peninnah lost two of hers, until eight of her ten children had died,  and she would have had to surrender all,"]]]
