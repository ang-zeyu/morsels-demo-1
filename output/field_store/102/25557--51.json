But if he was free, and  could make a title, it was equally the duty of the court not to suffer  Legrand to keep the land, and refuse the payment of the money, upon  the ground that Darnall was incapable of suing or being sued as a  citizen in a court of the United States. The character or citizenship  of the parties had no connection with the question of jurisdiction,  and the matter in dispute had no relation to the citizenship of  Darnall. Nor is such a question alluded to in the opinion of the  court.    Besides, we are by no means prepared to say that there are not many  cases, civil as well as criminal, in which a Circuit Court of the  United States may exercise jurisdiction, although one of the African  race is a party; that broad question is not before the court. The  question with which we are now dealing is, whether a person of the  African race can be a citizen of the United States, and become thereby  entitled to a special privilege, by virtue of his title to that  character, and which, under the Constitution, no one but a citizen can  claim. It is manifest that the case of Legrand and Darnall has no  bearing on that question, and can have no application to the case now  before the court.    This case, however, strikingly illustrates the consequences that would  follow the construction of the Constitution which would give the power  contended for to a State. It would in effect give it also to an  individual. For if the father of young Darnall had manumitted him in  his lifetime, and sent him to reside in a State which recognised him  as a citizen, he might have visited and sojourned in Maryland when he  pleased, and as long as he pleased, as a citizen of the United States;  and the State officers and tribunals would be compelled, by the  paramount authority of the Constitution, to receive him and treat him  as one of its citizens, exempt from the laws and police of the State  in relation to a person of that description, and allow him to enjoy  all the rights and privileges of citizenship, without respect to the  laws of Maryland, although such laws were deemed by it absolutely  essential to its own safety.    The only two provisions which point to them and include them, treat  them as property, and make it the duty of the Government to protect  it; no other power, in relation to this race, is to be found in the  Constitution; and as it is a Government of special delegated powers,  no authority beyond these two provisions can be constitutionally  exercised. The Government of the United States had no right to  interfere for any other purpose but that of protecting the rights of  the owner, leaving it altogether with the several States to deal with  this race, whether emancipated or not, as each State may think  justice, humanity, and the interests and safety of society, require.  The States evidently intended to reserve this power exclusively to  themselves.    No one, we presume, supposes that any change in public opinion or  feeling, in relation to this unfortunate race, in the civilized  nations of Europe or in this country, should induce the court to give  to the words of the Constitution a more liberal construction in their  favor than they were intended to bear when the instrument was framed  and adopted. Such an argument would be altogether inadmissible in any  tribunal called on to interpret it. If any of its provisions are  deemed unjust, there is a mode prescribed in the instrument itself by  which it may be amended; but while it remains unaltered, it must be  construed now as it was understood at the time of its adoption. It is  not only the same in words, but the same in meaning, and delegates the  same powers to the Government, and reserves and secures the same  rights and privileges to the citizen; and as long as it continues to  exist in its present form, it speaks not only in the same words, but  with the same meaning and intent with which it spoke when it came from  the hands of its framers, and was voted on and adopted by the people  of the United States. Any other rule of construction would abrogate  the judicial character of this court, and make it the mere reflex of  the popular opinion or passion of the day. This court was not created  by the Constitution for such purposes. Higher and graver trusts have  been confided to it, and it must not falter in the path of duty.    What the construction was at that time, we think can hardly admit of  doubt. We have the language of the Declaration of Independence and of  the Articles of Confederation, in addition to the plain words of the  Constitution itself; we have the legislation of the different States,  before, about the time, and since, the Constitution was adopted; we  have the legislation of Congress, from the time of its adoption to a  recent period; and we have the constant and uniform action of the  Executive Department, all concurring together, and leading to the same  result. And if anything in relation to the construction of the  Constitution can be regarded as settled, it is that which we now give  to the word \"citizen\" and the word \"people.\"    And upon a full and careful consideration of the subject, the court  is of opinion, that, upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement,  Dred Scott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the  Constitution of the United States, and not entitled as such to sue in  its courts; and, consequently, that the Circuit Court had no  jurisdiction of the case, and that the judgment on the plea in  abatement is erroneous.    We are aware that doubts are entertained by some of the members of the  court, whether the plea in abatement is legally before the court upon  this writ of error; but if that plea is regarded as waived, or out of  the case upon any other ground, yet the question as to the  jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is presented on the face of the bill  of exception itself, taken by the plaintiff at the trial; for he  admits that he and his wife were born slaves, but endeavors to make  out his title to freedom and citizenship by showing that they were  taken by their owner to certain places, hereinafter mentioned, where  slavery could not by law exist, and that they thereby became free, and  upon their return to Missouri became citizens of that State.    Now, if the removal of which he speaks did not give them their  freedom, then by his own admission he is still a slave; and whatever  opinions may be entertained in favor of the citizenship of a free  person of the African race, no one supposes that a slave is a citizen  of the State or of the United States. If, therefore, the acts done by  his owner did not make them free persons, he is still a slave, and  certainly incapable of suing in the character of a citizen.    The principle of law is too well settled to be disputed, that a court  can give no judgment for either party, where it has no jurisdiction;  and if, upon the showing of Scott himself, it appeared that he was  still a slave, the case ought to have been dismissed, and the judgment  against him and in favor of the defendant for costs, is, like that on  the plea in abatement, erroneous, and the suit ought to have been  dismissed by the Circuit Court for want of jurisdiction in that court.    But, before we proceed to examine this part of the case, it may be  proper to notice an objection taken to the judicial authority of this  court to decide it; and it has been said, that as this court has  decided against the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court on the plea in  abatement, it has no right to examine any question presented by the  exception; and that anything it may say upon that part of the case  will be extra-judicial, and mere obiter dicta.    This is a manifest mistake; there can be no doubt as to the  jurisdiction of this court to revise the judgment of a Circuit Court,  and to reverse it for any error apparent on the record, whether it be  the error of giving judgment in a case over which it had no  jurisdiction, or any other material error; and this, too, whether  there is a plea in abatement or not.    The objection appears to have arisen from confounding writs of error  to a State court, with writs of error to a Circuit Court of the United  States. Undoubtedly, upon a writ of error to a State court, unless the  record shows a case that gives jurisdiction, the case must be  dismissed for want of jurisdiction in _this court_. And if it is  dismissed on that ground, we have no right to examine and decide upon  any question presented by the bill of exceptions, or any other part of  the record. But writs of error to a State court, and to a Circuit  Court of the United States, are regulated by different laws, and stand  upon entirely different principles. And in a writ of error to a  Circuit Court of the United States, the whole record is before this  court for examination and decision; and if the sum in controversy is  large enough to give jurisdiction, it is not only the right, but it is  the judicial duty of the court, to examine the whole case as presented  by the record; and if it appears upon its face that any material error  or errors have been committed by the court below, it is the duty of  this court to reverse the judgment, and remand the case. And certainly  an error in passing a judgment upon the merits in favor of either  party, in a case which it was not authorized to try, and over which it  had no jurisdiction, is as grave an error as a court can commit.    The plea in abatement is not a plea to the jurisdiction of this court,  but to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. And it appears by the  record before us, that the Circuit Court committed an error, in  deciding that it had jurisdiction, upon the facts in the case,  admitted by the pleadings. It is the duty of the appellate tribunal to  correct this error; but that could not be done by dismissing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#9)"],[1,"ordeal  of this century. [20]    If one student tries to undermine another, such sinister  rivalry does a vast amount of injury to the Cause. To  fill one's pocket at the expense of his conscience, or to  build on the downfall of others, incapacitates one to  practise or teach Christian Science. The occasional tem- [25]  porary success of such an one is owing, in part, to the im-  possibility for those unacquainted with the mighty Truth  of _Christian_ Science to recognize, as such, the barefaced  errors that are taught--and the damaging effects these  leave on the practice of the learner, on the Cause, and [30]  on the health of the community.    [Page 44.]    Honest students speak the truth \"according to the [1]  pattern showed to thee in the mount,\" and live it: these  are not working for emoluments, and may profitably  teach people, who are ready to investigate this subject,  the rudiments of Christian Science. [5]    _Can Christian Science cure acute cases where there is_  _necessity for immediate relief, as in membranous croup?_    The remedial power of Christian Science is positive,  and its application direct. It cannot fail to heal in  every case of disease, when conducted by one who un- [10]  derstands this Science sufficiently to demonstrate its  highest possibilities.    _If I have the toothache, and nothing stops it until I_  _have the tooth extracted, and then the pain ceases, has_  _the mind, or extracting, or both, caused the pain to_ [15]  _cease?_    What you thought was pain in the bone or nerve, could  only have been a belief of pain in matter; for matter  has no sensation. It was a state of mortal thought made  manifest in the flesh. You call this body matter, when [20]  awake, or when asleep in a dream. That matter can re-  report pain, or that mind is _in_ matter, reporting sensa-  tions, is but a dream at all times. You believed that if  the tooth were extracted, the pain would cease: this de-  mand of mortal thought once met, your belief assumed [25]  a new form, and said, There is no more pain. When  your belief in pain ceases, the pain stops; for matter  has no intelligence of its own. By applying this men-  tal remedy or antidote directly to your belief, you scien-    [Page 45.]    tifically prove the fact that Mind is supreme. This is not [1]  done by will-power, for that is not Science but mesmerism.  The full understanding that God is Mind, and that mat-  ter is but a belief, enables you to control pain. Chris-  tian Science, by means of its Principle of metaphysical [5]  healing, is able to do more than to heal a toothache;  although its power to allay fear, prevent inflammation,  and destroy the necessity for ether--thereby avoiding  the fatal results that frequently follow the use of that  drug--render this Science invaluable in the practice [10]  of dentistry.    _Can an atheist or a profane man be cured by metaphysics,_  _or Christian Science?_    The moral status of the man demands the remedy of  Truth more in this than in most cases; therefore, under [15]  the deific law that supply invariably meets demand, this  Science is effectual in treating moral ailments. Sin is  not the master of divine Science, but _vice versa_; and  when Science in a single instance decides the conflict,  the patient is better both morally and physically. [20]    _If God made all that was made, and it was good, where_  _did evil originate?_    It never originated or existed as an entity. It is but a  false belief; even the belief that God is not what the  Scriptures imply Him to be, All-in-all, but that there [25]  is an opposite intelligence or mind termed evil. This  error of belief is idolatry, having \"other gods before me.\"  In John i. 3 we read, \"All things were made by Him;  and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"    [Page 46.]    The admission of the reality of evil perpetuates the belief [1]  or faith in evil. The Scriptures declare, \"To whom ye  yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are.\"  The leading self-evident proposition of Christian Science  is: good being real, evil, good's opposite, is unreal. This [5]  truism needs only to be tested scientifically to be found  true, and adapted to destroy the appearance of evil to an  extent beyond the power of any doctrine previously  entertained.    _Do you teach that you are equal with God?_ [10]    A reader of my writings would not present this ques-  tion. There are no such indications in the premises or  conclusions of Christian Science, and such a misconcep-  tion of Truth is not scientific. Man is not equal with  his Maker; that which is formed is not cause, but effect, [15]  and has no power underived from its creator. It is pos-  sible, and it is man's duty, so to throw the weight of his  thoughts and acts on the side of Truth, that he be ever  found in the scale _with_ his creator; not weighing  equally with Him, but comprehending at every point, in [20]  divine Science, the full significance of what the apostle  meant by the declaration, \"The Spirit itself beareth wit-  ness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and  if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with  Christ.\" In Science, man represents his divine Prin- [25]  ciple,--the Life and Love that are God,--even as the  idea of sound, in tones, represents harmony; but thought  has not yet wholly attained unto the Science of being,  wherein man is perfect even as the Father, his divine  Principle, is perfect. [30]    [Page 47.]    _How can I believe that there is no such thing as matter,_ [1]  _when I weigh over two hundred pounds and carry about_  _this weight daily?_    By learning that matter is but manifest mortal mind.  You entertain an adipose belief of yourself as substance; [5]  whereas, substance means more than matter: it is the  glory and permanence of Spirit: it is that which is  hoped for but unseen, that which the material senses  cannot take in. Have you never been so preoccupied in  thought when moving your body, that you did this with- [10]  out consciousness of its weight? If never in your waking  hours, you have been in your night-dreams; and these  tend to elucidate your day-dream, or the mythical nature  of matter, and the possibilities of mind when let loose  from its own beliefs. In sleep, a sense of the body ac- [15]  companies thought with less impediment than when  awake, which is the truer sense of being. In Science,  body is the servant of Mind, not its master: Mind is  supreme. Science reverses the evidence of material  sense with the spiritual sense that God, Spirit, is the only [20]  substance; and that man, His image and likeness, is  spiritual, not material. This great Truth does not de-  stroy but substantiates man's identity,--together with  his immortality and preexistence, or his spiritual co-  existence with his Maker. That which has a beginning [25]  must have an ending.    _What should one conclude as to Professor Carpenter's_  _exhibitions of mesmerism?_    That largely depends upon what one accepts as either  useful or true. I have no knowledge of mesmerism, [30]    [Page 48.]    practically or theoretically, save as I measure its demon- [1]  strations as a false belief, and avoid all that works ill. If  mesmerism has the power attributed to it by the gentle-  man referred to, it should neither be taught nor practised,  but should be conscientiously condemned. One thing [5]  is quite apparent; namely, that its so-called power is  despotic, and Mr. Carpenter deserves praise for his public  exposure of it. If such be its power, I am opposed to it,  as to every form of error,--whether of ignorance or  fanaticism, prompted by money-making or malice. It [10]  is enough for me to know that animal magnetism is neither  of God nor Science.    It is alleged that at one of his recent lectures in Bos-  ton Mr. Carpenter made a man drunk on water, and  then informed his audience that he could produce the [15]  effect of alcohol, or of any drug, on the human system,  through the action of mind alone. This honest declara-  tion as to the animus of animal magnetism and the pos-  sible purpose to which it can be devoted, has, we trust,  been made in season to open the eyes of the people to the [20]  hidden nature of some tragic events and sudden deaths  at this period.    _Was ever a person made insane by studying meta-_  _physics?_    Such an occurrence would be impossible, for the [25]  proper study of Mind-healing would cure the insane.  That persons have gone away from the Massachusetts  Metaphysical College \"made insane by Mrs. Eddy's  teachings,\" like a hundred other stories, is a baseless  fabrication offered solely to injure her or her school. [30]  The enemy is trying to make capital out of the follow-    [Page 49.]    ing case. A young lady entered the College class who, [1]  I quickly saw, had a tendency to monomania, and re-  quested her to withdraw before its close. We are cred-  ibly informed that, before entering the College, this  young lady had manifested some mental unsoundness, [5]  and have no doubt she could have been restored by  Christian Science treatment. Her friends employed a  homoeopathist, who had the skill and honor to state, as his  opinion given to her friends, that \"Mrs. Eddy's teach-  ings had not produced insanity.\" This is the only case [10]  that could be distorted into the claim of insanity ever  having occurred in a class of Mrs. Eddy's; while ac-  knowledged and notable cases of insanity have been  cured in her class.    _If all that is mortal is a dream or error, is not_ [15]  _our capacity for formulating a dream, real; is it not_  _God-made; and if God-made, can it be wrong, sinful, or_  _an error?_    The spirit of Truth leads into all truth, and enables  man to discern between the real and the unreal. Enter- [20]  taining the common belief in the opposite of goodness,  and that evil is as real as good, opposes the leadings of  the divine Spirit that are"]]]
