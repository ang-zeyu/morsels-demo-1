[Illustration]      [Illustration: MR. SMITH'S PRIZE HE-CAT.]          THE TORTOISESHELL CAT.      I now come to the section of the short-haired domestic cat, a variety  possessing sub-varieties. Whether these all came from the same origin is  doubtful, although in breeding many of the different colours will breed  back to the striped or tabby colour, and, _per contra_, white  whole-coloured cats are often got from striped or spotted parents, and  _vice versa_. Those that have had any experience of breeding  domesticated animals or birds, know perfectly well how difficult it is  to keep certain peculiarities gained by years of perseverance of  breeding for such points of variation, or what is termed excellence.  Place a few fancy pigeons, for instance, in the country and let them  match how they like, and one would be quite surprised, unless he were a  naturalist, to note the great changes that occur in a few years, and the  unmistakable signs of reversion towards their ancestral stock--that of  the Rock pigeon. But with the cat this is somewhat different, as little  or no attempts have been made, as far as I know of, until cat shows were  instituted, to improve any particular breed either in form or colour.  Nor has it even yet, with the exception of the long-haired cats. Why  this is so I am at a loss to understand, but the fact remains. Good  well-developed cats of certain colours fetch large prices, and are, if I  may use the term, perpetual prize-winners. I will take as an instance  the tortoiseshell tom, he, or male cat as one of the most scarce, and  the red or yellow tabby she-cat as the next; and yet the possessor of  either, with proper care and attention, I have little or no doubt, has  it in his power to produce either variety _ad libitum_. It is now many  years since I remember the first \"tortoiseshell tom-cat;\" nor can I now  at this distance of time quite call to mind whether or not it was not a  tortoiseshell-and-white, and not a tortoiseshell pure and simple. It was  exhibited in Piccadilly. If I remember rightly, I made a drawing of it,  but as it is about forty years ago, of this I am not certain, although I  have lately been told that I did, and that the price asked for the cat  was 100 guineas.    [Illustration: EXAMPLE OF TORTOISESHELL CAT, VERY DARK VARIETY.]    This supposed scarcity was rudely put aside by the appearance, at the  Crystal Palace Show of 1871, of no less than one tortoiseshell he-cat  (exhibited by Mr. Smith) and three tortoiseshell-and-white he-cats, but  it will be observed there was really but only one tortoiseshell he-cat,  the others having white. On referring to the catalogues of the  succeeding shows, no other pure tortoiseshell has been exhibited, and he  ceased to appear after 1873; but tortoiseshell-and-white have been shown  from 1871, varying in number from five to three until 1885. One of  these, a tortoiseshell-and-white belonging to Mr. Hurry, gained no fewer  than nine first prizes at the Crystal Palace, besides several firsts at  other shows; this maintains my statement, that a really good scarce  variety of cats is a valuable investment, Mr. Hurry's cat Totty keeping  up his price of L100 till the end.    As may have been gathered from the foregoing remarks, the points of the  tortoiseshell he-cat are, black-red and yellow in patches, but no  _white_. The colouring should be in broad, well-defined blotches and  solid in colour, not mealy or tabby-like in the marking, but clear,  sharp, and distinct, and the richer and deeper the colours the better.  When this is so the animal presents a very handsome appearance. The eyes  should be orange, the tail long and thick towards the base, the form  slim, graceful, and elegant, and not too short on the leg, to which this  breed has a tendency. Coming then to the actual tortoiseshell he, or  male cat without white, I have never seen but one at the Shows, and that  was exhibited by Mr. Smith. It does not appear that Mr. Smith bred any  from it, nor do I know whether he took any precautions to do so; but if  not, I am still of the opinion that more might have been produced. In  Cassell's \"Natural History,\" it is stated that the tortoiseshell cat is  quite common in Egypt and in the south of Europe. This I can readily  believe, as I think that it comes from a different stock than the usual  short-haired cat, the texture of the hair being different, the form of  tail also. I should much like to know whether in that country, where the  variety is so common, there exists any number of tortoiseshell he-cats.  In England the he-kittens are almost invariably red-tabby or  red-tabby-and-white; the red-tabby she-cats are almost as scarce as  tortoiseshell-and-white he-cats. Yet if red-tabby she-cats can be  produced, I am of opinion that tortoiseshell he-cats could also. I had  one of the former, a great beauty, and hoped to perpetuate the breed,  but it unfortunately fell a victim to wires set by poachers for game.  Again returning to the tortoiseshell, I have noted that, in drawings  made by the Japanese, the cats are always of this colour; that being so,  it leads one to suppose that in that country tortoiseshell he-cats must  be plentiful. Though the drawings are strong evidence, they are not  absolute proof. I have asked several travelling friends questions as  regards the Japanese cats, but in no case have I found them to have  taken sufficient notice for their testimony to be anything else than  worthless. I shall be very thankful for any information on this subject,  for to myself, and doubtless also to many others, it is exceedingly  interesting. Any one wishing to breed rich brown tabbies, should use a  tortoiseshell she-cat with a very brown and black-banded he-cat. They  are not so good from the spotted tabby, often producing merely  tortoiseshell tabbies instead of brown tabbies, or true tortoiseshells.  My remarks as to the colouring of the tortoiseshell he-cat are equally  applicable to the she-cat, which should not have any white. Of the  tortoiseshell-and-white hereafter.    To breed tortoiseshell he-cats, I should use males of a whole colour,  such as either white, black, or blue; and on no account any tabby, no  matter the colour. What is wanted is patches of colour, not tiny streaks  or spots; and I feel certain that, for those who persevere, there will  be successful results.    [Illustration]      [Illustration]          THE TORTOISESHELL-AND-WHITE CAT.      This is a more common mixture of colouring than the tortoiseshell pure  and simple without white, and seems to be widely spread over different  parts of the world. It is the opinion of some that this colour and the  pure tortoiseshell is the original domestic cat, and that the other  varieties of marking and colours are but deviations produced by  crossing with wild varieties. My brother, John Jenner Weir, F.L.S.,  F.Z.S., holds somewhat to this opinion; but, to me, it is rather  difficult to arrive at this conclusion. In fact, I can scarcely  realise the ground on which the theory is based--at the same time, I  do not mean to ignore it entirely. And yet, if this be so, from what  starting-point was the original domestic cat derived, and by what  means were the rich and varied markings obtained? I am fully aware  that by selection cats with large patches of colour may be obtained;  still, there remain the peculiar markings of the tortoiseshell. Nor is  this by any means an uncommon colour, not only in this country, but in  many others, and there also appears to be a peculiar fixedness of  this, especially in the female, but why it is not so in the male I am  at a loss to understand, the males almost invariably coming either  red-tabby or red-tabby-and-white. One would suppose that black or  white would be equally likely; but, as far as my observations take me,  this is not so, though I have seen both pure white, yellow, red, and  black in litters of kittens, but this might be different were the he  parent tortoiseshell.    Some years ago I was out with a shooting party not far from  Snowdon, in Wales, when turning past a large rock I came on a  sheltered nook, and there in a nest made of dry grasses laid six  tortoiseshell-and-white kittens about eight to ten days old. I was  much surprised at this, as I did not know of any house near,  therefore these must have been the offspring of some cat or cats  that were leading a roving or wild life, and yet it had no effect  as to the deviation of the colour. I left them there, and without  observing the sex. I was afterwards sorry, as it is just possible,  though scarcely probable, that one or more of the six, being all  of the same colour, might have proved to be a male. As I left the  neighbourhood a few days after I saw no more of them, nor have I  since heard of any being there; so conclude they in some way were  destroyed.    I have observed in the breed of tortoiseshell or  tortoise-shell-and-white that the hair is of a coarser texture than  the ordinary domestic cat, and that the tail is generally thicker,  especially at the base, though some few are thin-tailed; yet I prefer  the thick and tapering form. Some are very much so, and of a good  length; the legs are generally somewhat short; I do not ever remember  seeing a really long-legged tortoiseshell, though when this is so if  not too long it adds much to its grace of action. I give a drawing of  what I consider to be a GOOD tortoiseshell-and-white tom or he-cat. It  will be observed that there is more white on the chest, belly, and  hind legs than is allowable in the black-and-white cat. This I deem  necessary for artistic beauty, when the colour is laid on in  _patches_, although it should be even, clear, and distinct in its  outline; the larger space of white adds brilliancy to the red, yellow,  and black colouring. The face is one of the parts which should have  some uniformity of colour, and yet not so, but a mere _balancing_"]]]
