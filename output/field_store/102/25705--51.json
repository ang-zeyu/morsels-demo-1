[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],[0,"The Intrusion of Jimmy (#9)"],[1," started almost  literally with nothing. By carefully excluding from his mind every  thought except that of making money, he had risen in the world with  a gruesome persistence which nothing could check. At the age of  fifty-one, he was chairman of Blunt's Stores, L't'd, a member of  Parliament (silent as a wax figure, but a great comfort to the party  by virtue of liberal contributions to its funds), and a knight. This  was good, but he aimed still higher; and, meeting Spennie's aunt,  Lady Julia Coombe-Crombie, just at the moment when, financially, the  Dreevers were at their lowest ebb, he had effected a very  satisfactory deal by marrying her, thereby becoming, as one might  say, Chairman of Dreever, L't'd. Until Spennie should marry money,  an act on which his chairman vehemently insisted, Sir Thomas held  the purse, and except in minor matters ordered by his wife, of whom  he stood in uneasy awe, had things entirely his own way.    One afternoon, a little over a year after the events recorded in the  preceding chapter, Sir Thomas was in his private room, looking out  of the window, from which the view was very beautiful. The castle  stood on a hill, the lower portion of which, between the house and  the lake, had been cut into broad terraces. The lake itself and its  island with the little boat-house in the center gave a glimpse of  fairyland.    But it was not altogether the beauty of the view that had drawn Sir  Thomas to the window. He was looking at it chiefly because the  position enabled him to avoid his wife's eye; and just at the moment  he was rather anxious to avoid his wife's eye. A somewhat stormy  board-meeting was in progress, and Lady Julia, who constituted the  board of directors, had been heckling the chairman. The point under  discussion was one of etiquette, and in matters of etiquette Sir  Thomas felt himself at a disadvantage.    \"I tell you, my dear,\" he said to the window, \"I am not easy in my  mind.\"    \"Nonsense,\" snapped Lady Julia; \"absurd--ridiculous!\"    Lady Julia Blunt, when conversing, resembled a Maxim gun more than  anything else.    \"But your diamonds, my dear.\"    \"We can take care of them.\"    \"But why should we have the trouble? Now, if we--\"    \"It's no trouble.\"    \"When we were married, there was a detective--\"    \"Don't be childish, Thomas. Detectives at weddings are quite  customary.\"    \"But--\"    \"Bah!\"    \"I paid twenty thousand pounds for that rope of diamonds,\" said Sir  Thomas, obstinately. Switch things upon a cash basis, and he was  more at ease.    \"May I ask if you suspect any of our guests of being criminals?\"  inquired Lady Julia, with a glance of chill disdain.    Sir Thomas looked out of the window. At the moment, the sternest  censor could have found nothing to cavil at in the movements of such  of the house-party as were in sight. Some were playing tennis, some  clock-golf, and others were smoking.    \"Why, no,\" he admitted.    \"Of course. Absurd--quite absurd!\"    \"But the servants. We have engaged a number of new servants lately.\"    \"With excellent recommendations.\"    Sir Thomas was on the point of suggesting that the recommendations  might be forged, but his courage failed him. Julia was sometimes so  abrupt in these little discussions! She did not enter into his point  of view. He was always a trifle inclined to treat the castle as a  branch of Blunt's Stores. As proprietor of the stores, he had made a  point of suspecting everybody, and the results had been excellent.  In Blunt's Stores, you could hardly move in any direction without  bumping into a gentlemanly detective, efficiently disguised. For the  life of him, Sir Thomas could not see why the same principle should  not obtain at Dreever. Guests at a country house do not as a rule  steal their host's possessions, but then it is only an occasional  customer at a store who goes in for shop-lifting. It was the  principle of the thing, he thought: Be prepared against every  emergency. With Sir Thomas Blunt, suspiciousness was almost a mania.  He was forced to admit that the chances were against any of his  guests exhibiting larcenous tendencies, but, as for the servants, he  thoroughly mistrusted them all, except Saunders, the butler. It had  seemed to him the merest prudence that a detective from a private  inquiry agency should be installed at the castle while the house was  full. Somewhat rashly, he had mentioned this to his wife, and Lady  Julia's critique of the scheme had been terse and unflattering.    \"I suppose,\" said Lady Julia sarcastically, \"you will jump to the  conclusion that this man whom Spennie is bringing down with him  to-day is a criminal of some sort?\"    \"Eh? Is Spennie bringing a friend?\"    There was not a great deal of enthusiasm in Sir Thomas's voice. His  nephew was not a young man whom he respected very highly. Spennie  regarded his uncle with nervous apprehension, as one who would deal  with his short-comings with vigor and severity. Sir Thomas, for his  part, looked on Spennie as a youth who would get into mischief  unless under his uncle's eye.    \"I had a telegram from him just now,\" Lady Julia explained.    \"Who is his friend?\"    \"He doesn't say. He just says he's a man he met in London.\"    \"H'm!\"    \"And what does, 'H'm!' mean?\" demanded Lady Julia.    \"A man can pick up strange people in London,\" said Sir Thomas,  judicially.    \"Nonsense!\"    \"Just as you say, my dear.\"    Lady Julia rose.    \"As for what you suggest about the detective, it is of course  absolutely absurd.\"    \"Quite so, my dear.\"    \"You mustn't think of it.\"    \"Just as you say, my dear.\"    Lady Julia left the room.    What followed may afford some slight clue to the secret of Sir  Thomas Blunt's rise in the world. It certainly suggests singleness  of purpose, which is one of the essentials of success.    No sooner had the door closed behind Lady Julia than he went to his  writing-table, took pen and paper, and wrote the following letter:    To the Manager, Wragge's Detective Agency. Holborn Bars, London E.  C.    SIR: With reference to my last of the 28th, ult., I should be glad  if you would send down immediately one of your best men. Am making  arrangements to receive him. Kindly instruct him to present himself  at Dreever Castle as applicant for position of valet to myself. I  will see and engage him on his arrival, and further instruct him in  his duties.    Yours faithfully,    THOS. BLUNT.    P. S. I shall expect him to-morrow evening. There is a good train  leaving Paddington at 2:15.    Sir Thomas read this over, put in a comma, then placed it in an  envelope, and lighted a cigar with the air of one who can be  checked, yes, but vanquished, never.          CHAPTER IX    FRIENDS, NEW AND OLD      On the night of the day on which Sir Thomas Blunt wrote and  dispatched his letter to Wragge's Detective Agency, Jimmy Pitt  chanced to stop at the Savoy.    If you have the money and the clothes, and do not object to being  turned out into the night just as you are beginning to enjoy  yourself, there are few things pleasanter than supper at the Savoy  Hotel, London. But, as Jimmy sat there, eying the multitude through  the smoke of his cigarette, he felt, despite all the brightness and  glitter, that this was a flat world, and that he was very much alone  in it.    A little over a year had passed since the merry evening at Police-Captain  McEachern's. During that time, he had covered a good deal of  new ground. His restlessness had reasserted itself. Somebody had  mentioned Morocco in his hearing, and a fortnight later he was in  Fez.    Of the principals in that night's drama, he had seen nothing more.  It was only when, after walking home on air, rejoicing over the  strange chance that had led to his finding and having speech with  the lady of the Lusitania, he had reached Fifty-Ninth Street, that  he realized how he had also lost her. It suddenly came home to him  that not only did he not know her address, but he was ignorant of  her name. Spike had called the man with the revolver \"boss\"  throughout--only that and nothing more. Except that he was a  police-captain, Jimmy knew as little about the man as he had before their  meeting. And Spike, who held the key to the mystery, had vanished.  His acquaintances of that night had passed out of his life like  figures in a waking dream. As far as the big man with the pistol was  concerned, this did not distress him. He had known that massive  person only for about a quarter of an hour, but to his thinking that  was ample. Spike he would have liked to meet again, but he bore the  separation with much fortitude. There remained the girl of the ship;  and she had haunted him with unfailing persistence during every one  of the three hundred and eighty-four days that had passed since  their meeting.    It was the thought of her that had made New York seem cramped. For  weeks, Jimmy had patrolled the likely streets, the Park, and  Riverside Drive, in the hope of meeting her. He had gone to the  theaters and restaurants, but with no success. Sometimes, he had  wandered through the Bowery, on the chance of meeting Spike. He had  seen red heads in profusion, but never again that of his young  disciple in the art of burglary. In the end, he had wearied of the  other friends of the Strollers, had gone out again on his  wanderings. He was greatly missed, especially by that large section  of his circle which was in a perpetual state of wanting a little to  see it through till Saturday. For years, Jimmy had been to these  unfortunates a human bank on which they could draw at will. It  offended them that one of those rare natures which are always good  for two dollars at any hour of the day should be allowed to waste  itself on places like Morocco and Spain--especially Morocco, where,  by all accounts, there were brigands with almost a New York sense of  touch.    They argued earnestly with Jimmy. They spoke of Raisuli and Kaid  MacLean.

But if it gore a slave or serving-woman, let the owner give 30  shillings of silver and let the ox be stoned to death.  22. If anyone dig a well or open up a closed one and does not close it  up again, let him pay for whatever cattle fall in; but let him have the  dead animal for his own use.  23. If an ox wound another man's ox so it is dead, let them sell the  live ox and share the proceeds, and also the flesh of the dead ox. But  if the owner knew the ox was butting and would not restrain it, let him  hand over the other i.e. live ox for it but let him have all the flesh  of the dead ox for his own use.  24. If anyone steal another man's ox and kill or sell it, let him give  two oxen in restitution. And four sheep for one stolen. If he i.e. the  thief does not have anything to give in restitution, let him be sold  himself to raise the money.  25. If a thief break into a man's house by night and is killed there,  he i.e. the house-owner shall not be guilty of manslaughter. But if he  i.e. the house-owner does this after sunrise, he is guilty of  manslaughter, and shall himself perish, unless he acted in  self-defence. If there is found in the possession of the living thief  things he had already stolen, let him make restitution for it two-fold.  26. If anyone damage another man's vineyard or his crops or any part of  his estate, let him pay compensation according to how it is assessed.  27. If a fire is lit in order to burn rubbish, let him who started the  fire pay compensation for any consequent damage.  28. If anyone entrusts any possession to his friend and the friend  appropriates it for himself, let him i.e. the friend clear himself and  prove that he committed no fraud in the matter. If it was livestock,  and he says that raiders took it, or it perished of itself, and if he  has proof, he need not pay up. But if he has no proof, and the original  owner does not believe him, let him make an oath to clear himself.  29. If anyone seduce an uncommitted woman and sleeps with her, let him  pay for her and take her then as his wife. But if the woman's father is  unwilling to let her go, then let the seducer hand over money in  proportion to her dowry.  30. The women who are accustomed to harbour enchanters and wizards and  witches - do not allow them to live.  31. And he that has intercourse with animals shall suffer death.  32. And he that sacrifices to idols, rather than to God alone, let him  suffer death.  33. Do not harass visitors from abroad and foreigners, for you were  formerly strangers on the land of the Egyptians.  34. Do not harm widows and step-children, neither do them any injury.  If you do otherwise, they will call upon Me and I will listen to them,  and then I will slay you with my sword and I will ensure that your  wives shall be widows and your children orphans.  35. If you hand over money as a loan to your comrade who wishes to live  with you, do not coerce him like an underling and do not oppress him  with the interest.  36. If someone has only a single garment to cover and clothe himself  with and he hands it over as a pledge, let it be returned before the  sun sets. If you do not do so then he will call unto Me, and I will  listen to him because I am very clement.  37. Do not reproach you Lord, nor curse the lord of the people.  38. Your tithe i.e. tenth-part of profit and your first-fruits of  moving animals and growing crops, offer to God.  39. All the flesh that wild animals leave, do not eat it but give it to  the dogs.  40. Do not bother to give credence to the word of a false man, and do  not approve his opinions; do not repeat any of his assertions.  41. Do not join in the false judgment and evil aspirations of the many  nor join in their rumours and outcry, against your own conscience, at  the incitement of some ignorant person. Do not support them.  42. If the stray cattle of another man come into your possession,  though it be the property of your enemy, let him know about it.  43. Judge equably, do not lay down one rule for the rich, another for  the poor; do not decide one way for a friend, another for a foe.  44. Always shun falsehood.  45. Never slay a righteous and innocent man.  46. Never accept bribes, for they very often blind the minds of wise  men and pervert their words.  47. Do not behave unkindly to foreigners and visitors from abroad; do  not harass them with unjust acts.  48. Never swear an oath by heathen gods, nor in any circumstances call  upon them.          Alfred also issued a set of laws to cover the whole country  that he derived from laws of various regional kings in England as  follows:  \"1. First we insist that there is particular need that each person  shall keep his oath and his pledge carefully. If anyone be compelled to  give either of these wrongly, either to support treachery to his lord  or to provide any unlawful aid, then it is better to forswear than to  fulfil. But if he pledge himself to that which it is right for him to  fulfil and fails, let him submissively hand over his weapons and his  possessions to his friends to keep, and stay forty days in prison in a  property of the king. Let him undergo there whatever the bishop  prescribes as penance, and let his kinsmen feed him if he himself has  no food. If he has no kin or has no food, let the king's officer feed  him. If one has to compel him to this i.e. to surrender, and otherwise  he is unwilling to co-operate - if they have to bind him he shall  forfeit his weapons and his possessions. If he is slain while  resisting, let him lie uncompensated. If he makes an escape before the  time is up, and he is recaptured, let him stay forty days in prison as  he would have previously. But if he gets away, let him be banished and  excommunicated from all the churches of Christ. Further, if someone has  provided surety for him, let him compensate for the breach of surety as  custom require him, and atone for the breach of pledge as his confessor  imposes in his case.  2. If anyone seek out as sanctuary for any offence any of the monastic  houses to which the king's revenue applies, or any other exempt  community that is worthy of respect he shall have a period of three  days of immunity, unless he wants to negotiate before that. If someone  harms him during that period, either by assault or by fettering him,,  or by a penetrating wound, let the aggressor pay compensation for each  of such attacks according to proper practice, both with wergeld and  with a fine, and 120 shillings to that community, as compensation for  breach of sanctuary, and let his own possessions be forfeit.  3. If anyone violate the king's surety, let him pay compensation for  the original charge as customary law direct, and for the violation of  surety with five pounds of the purer pennies. In the case of breach of  an archbishop's surety or protection, let him compensate with three  pounds. For violation of the surety or protection of another bishop or  official [earldorman], let him make compensation with two pounds.  4. If anyone plot against the king's life, either directly or by  harbouring outlaws or indirectly through the agency of his men, let him  be liable with his life and with all that he owns. If he desire to  prove himself loyal, let him do that by paying a king's wergeld.  Similar protection we ordain for all ranks, both common and noble  [earl]: whoever plots against his master's life shall be liable with  his life and with all that he owns - or let him show his loyalty by  paying his master's wergeld.  5. Also we appoint to every church that a bishop has consecrated this  right of sanctuary: that if a party to a feud run or ride to the  church, then no one may drag him forth for seven days. If however  anyone does that, then let him be liable at the rate of breach of a  king's protection and at the rate of breach of church sanctuary - more  if he take more from the site. [And the sanctuary seeker shall be safe]  if he can survive hunger, and unless he himself try to fight his way  out. If the community have greater need of their church, let them keep  him in another building, and let that not have the more doors than the  church itself; Let the church official ensure that no one give the  sanctuary-seeker food during that period. If he himself is willing to  hand over his weapons to his foes, let them keep him for 30 days and  inform his kin about him. Also it shall count as sanctuary if some man  seek out a church about any offence that had not previously been  revealed, and there confess himself in God's name - let the penalty be  half remitted. He that steal on Sunday or at Yule or at Easter or on  Holy Thursday or on the Rogation days - for each of those we intend  that there should be a double-penalty, as during Lent.  6. If anyone steal something in a church, let him pay a plain  compensation and the fine such as they consider appropriate to the  plain compensation, and let them strike the hand off with which he did  it i.e. the deed. If he wishes to redeem his hand, and they consent to  that, let him pay in proportion to his wergeld.  7. If anyone fights in the king's hall or draw his weapon, and he is  seized, let the penalty be at the king's judgement, either death or  life, as he is willing to grant him. If he escapes and is captured  later, let him pay in proportion to his wergeld, and atone for the  offence with wergeld and fine, as he may deserve by his act.  8. If anyone abducts a nun of a nunnery without the king's or the  bishop's leave, let him pay 120 shillings, half to the king, half to  the bishop and the church patron who had charge of the nun. If she  lives longer than he that abducted her, let her not have any of his  estate. If she bears a child, let that not have any more of the estate  than the mother. If anyone slay her child let him pay the king the  maternal kindred's share; to the paternal kin let him pay their share.  9. If anyone slay a woman with"]]]
