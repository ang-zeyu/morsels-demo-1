Most of the trench injuries are  of the head, and therefore there is a high proportion of killed in  the daily warfare as opposed to an attack. Our Canadian plots fill up  rapidly.          And here is one last note to his mother:      On the eve of the battle of Ypres I was indebted to you for a letter  which said \"take good care of my son Jack, but I would not have you  unmindful that, sometimes, when we save we lose.\" I have that last happy  phrase to thank. Often when I had to go out over the areas that were  being shelled, it came into my mind. I would shoulder the box, and \"go  to it\".          At this time the Canadian division was moving south to take its share in  the events that happened in the La Bassee sector. Here is the record:        Tuesday, June 1st, 1915.    1-1/2 miles northeast of Festubert, near La Bassee.    Last night a 15 pr. and a 4-inch howitzer fired at intervals of five  minutes from 8 till 4; most of them within 500 or 600 yards--a very  tiresome procedure; much of it is on registered roads. In the morning I  walked out to Le Touret to the wagon lines, got Bonfire, and rode to  the headquarters at Vendin-lez-Bethune, a little village a mile  past Bethune. Left the horse at the lines and walked back again. An  unfortunate shell in the 1st killed a sergeant and wounded two men;  thanks to the strong emplacements the rest of the crew escaped. In the  evening went around the batteries and said good-bye. We stood by while  they laid away the sergeant who was killed. Kind hands have made two  pathetic little wreaths of roses; the grave under an apple-tree, and  the moon rising over the horizon; a siege-lamp held for the book. Of  the last 41 days the guns have been in action 33. Captain Lockhart, late  with Fort Garry Horse, arrived to relieve me. I handed over, came up to  the horse lines, and slept in a covered wagon in a courtyard. We were  all sorry to part--the four of us have been very intimate and had agreed  perfectly--and friendships under these circumstances are apt to be the  real thing. I am sorry to leave them in such a hot corner, but cannot  choose and must obey orders. It is a great relief from strain, I must  admit, to be out, but I could wish that they all were.          This phase of the war lasted two months precisely,    and to John McCrae it must have seemed a lifetime since he went into  this memorable action. The events preceding the second battle of Ypres  received scant mention in his letters; but one remains, which brings  into relief one of the many moves of that tumultuous time.        April 1st, 1915.    We moved out in the late afternoon, getting on the road a little after  dark. Such a move is not unattended by danger, for to bring horses and  limbers down the roads in the shell zone in daylight renders them liable  to observation, aerial or otherwise. More than that, the roads are now  beginning to be dusty, and at all times there is the noise which carries  far. The roads are nearly all registered in their battery books, so if  they suspect a move, it is the natural thing to loose off a few rounds.  However, our anxiety was not borne out, and we got out of the danger  zone by 8.30--a not too long march in the dark, and then for the last  of the march a glorious full moon. The houses everywhere are as dark as  possible, and on the roads noises but no lights. One goes on by the long  rows of trees that are so numerous in this country, on cobblestones and  country roads, watching one's horses' ears wagging, and seeing not much  else. Our maps are well studied before we start, and this time we  are not far out of familiar territory. We got to our new billet about  10--quite a good farmhouse; and almost at once one feels the relief of  the strain of being in the shell zone. I cannot say I had noticed it  when there; but one is distinctly relieved when out of it.        Such, then, was the life in Flanders fields in which the verse was born.  This is no mere surmise. There is a letter from Major-General E. W. B.  Morrison, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., who commanded the Brigade at the time,  which is quite explicit. \"This poem,\" General Morrison writes, \"was  literally born of fire and blood during the hottest phase of the second  battle of Ypres. My headquarters were in a trench on the top of the bank  of the Ypres Canal, and John had his dressing station in a hole dug in  the foot of the bank. During periods in the battle men who were shot  actually rolled down the bank into his dressing station. Along from us  a few hundred yards was the headquarters of a regiment, and many times  during the sixteen days of battle, he and I watched them burying their  dead whenever there was a lull. Thus the crosses, row on row, grew  into a good-sized cemetery. Just as he describes, we often heard in the  mornings the larks singing high in the air, between the crash of the  shell and the reports of the guns in the battery just beside us. I have  a letter from him in which he mentions having written the poem to pass  away the time between the arrival of batches of wounded, and partly as  an experiment with several varieties of poetic metre. I have a sketch of  the scene, taken at the time, including his dressing station; and during  our operations at Passchendaele last November, I found time to make a  sketch of the scene of the crosses, row on row, from which he derived  his inspiration.\"    The last letter from the Front is dated June 1st, 1915. Upon that day he  was posted to No. 3 General Hospital at Boulogne, and placed in charge  of medicine with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel as of date 17th April,  1915. Here he remained until the day of his death on January 28th, 1918.          III. The Brand of War      There are men who pass through such scenes unmoved. If they have  eyes, they do not see; and ears, they do not hear. But John McCrae was  profoundly moved, and bore in his body until the end the signs of his  experience. Before taking up his new duties he made a visit to the  hospitals in Paris to see if there was any new thing that might be  learned. A Nursing Sister in the American Ambulance at Neuilly-sur-Seine  met him in the wards. Although she had known him for fifteen years she  did not recognize him,--he appeared to her so old, so worn, his face  lined and ashen grey in colour, his expression dull, his action slow and  heavy.    To those who have never seen John McCrae since he left Canada this  change in his appearance will seem incredible. He was of the Eckfords,  and the Eckford men were \"bonnie men\", men with rosy cheeks. It was  a year before I met him again, and he had not yet recovered from the  strain. Although he was upwards of forty years of age when he left  Canada he had always retained an appearance of extreme youthfulness. He  frequented the company of men much younger than himself, and their youth  was imputed to him. His frame was tall and well knit, and he showed  alertness in every move. He would arise from the chair with every muscle  in action, and walk forth as if he were about to dance.    The first time I saw him he was doing an autopsy at the Montreal General  Hospital upon the body of a child who had died under my care. This must  have been in the year 1900, and the impression of boyishness remained  until I met him in France sixteen years later. His manner of dress  did much to produce this illusion. When he was a student in London he  employed a tailor in Queen Victoria Street to make his clothes; but with  advancing years he neglected to have new measurements taken or to alter  the pattern of his cloth. To obtain a new suit was merely to write a  letter, and he was always economical of time. In those days jackets were  cut short, and he adhered to the fashion with persistent care.    This appearance of youth at times caused chagrin to those patients who  had heard of his fame as a physician, and called upon him for the  first time. In the Royal Victoria Hospital, after he had been appointed  physician, he entered the wards and asked a nurse to fetch a screen so  that he might examine a patient in privacy.    \"Students are not allowed to use screens,\" the young woman warned him  with some asperity in her voice.    If I were asked to state briefly the impression which remains with me  most firmly, I should say it was one of continuous laughter. That is not  true, of course, for in repose his face was heavy, his countenance more  than ruddy; it was even of a \"choleric\" cast, and at times almost livid,  especially when he was recovering from one of those attacks of asthma  from which he habitually suffered. But his smile was his own, and it was  ineffable. It filled the eyes, and illumined the face. It was the smile  of sheer fun, of pure gaiety, of sincere playfulness, innocent of irony;  with a tinge of sarcasm--never. When he allowed himself to speak of  meanness in the profession, of dishonesty in men, of evil in the world,  his face became formidable. The glow of his countenance deepened; his  words were bitter, and the tones harsh. But the indignation would  not last. The smile would come back. The effect was spoiled. Everyone  laughed with him.    After his experience at the front the old gaiety never returned. There  were moments of irascibility and moods of irritation. The desire for  solitude grew upon him, and with Bonfire and Bonneau he would go apart  for long afternoons far afield by the roads and lanes about Boulogne.  The truth is: he felt that he and all had failed, and that the torch  was thrown from failing hands. We have heard much of the suffering, the  misery, the cold, the wet, the gloom of those first three winters; but  no tongue has yet uttered the inner misery of heart that was bred of  those three years of failure to break the enemy's force.    He was not alone in this shadow of deep darkness. Givenchy, Festubert,  Neuve-Ch"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#9)"],[1,"that first  long gaze, vowed to right this deadly wrong in the only way left to a  mortal.    But how strange that such a man, in such a place, should be snatched out  of life by the hand of an assassin! He must think over it, and he could  think best when passing slowly along some quiet by-way or street. So he  closed his door softly, and all unconscious that he was observed from  the window of the outer office, he vaulted across the low fence,  striking noiselessly upon the soft turf on the further side; and, after  a moment of hesitation, turned the corner and went down Main Street.    Past the shops, the fine new church, the two hotels, one new and one  old. Past the little park and around it to the street, terraced and tree  planted, where the more pretentious dwellings and several modish new  houses, built for the summer boarder, stood. It was a balmy night. Every  star seemed out, and there was a moon, bright, but on the wane.    Ferrars walked slowly upon the soft turf, avoiding the boards and stones  of the walks and street crossings. Now and then he paused to look at  some fair garden, lovely in the moonlight, or up at the stars, and once,  at least, at a window, open to the breezes of night and revealing that  which sent Ferrars homeward presently with a question on his lips. He  paced the length of the terraced street, and passed by the cottage  where Hilda Grant waked and wept perchance, and as he re-entered his  room silently and shadow-like, he said to himself--    \"Is it fate or Providence that prompts us to these reasonless acts? I  may be wrong, I may be mistaken, but I could almost believe that I have  found my first clue.\"    And yet he had heard nothing, and yet all he had seen was a woman's  shadow, reflected fitfully by the waning moon, as she paced her room to  and fro, to and fro, like some restless or tormented animal, and now and  then lifted her arms aloft in despair? in malediction? in triumph? in  entreaty?--which?    In spite of his brief rest, if rest it was, Ferrars was astir before  sunrise: but, even so, he found the doctor awake before him, and his  horse in waiting at the side gate.    They drove swiftly and were soon within sight of the Indian Mound.    \"Show me first the place where the body was found,\" Ferrars had said to  his guide as they set out, and when the two stood at this spot, which  some one had marked with two small stakes, and the doctor had answered  some brief questions regarding the road through the fringe of wood, the  mound, and the formation of the lake shore further south or away from  the town, the detective announced his wish to be left alone to pursue  his work in his own way.    \"Your guest will be astir early if I am not much mistaken,\" he said.  \"And you have Miss Grant to look after, and may be wanted for a dozen  reasons before I return. I can easily walk back, and think you will see  me at the breakfast hour, which you must on no account delay.\"    Two hours later, and just as the doctor's man had announced breakfast,  the detective returned, and at once joined the two in the dining-room.    He said nothing of his morning excursion, but the doctor's quick eye  noted his look of gravity, and a certain preoccupation of manner which  Ferrars did not attempt to hide. Before the meal was ended Doctor Barnes  was convinced that something was puzzling the detective, and troubling  him not a little.    After breakfast, and while Brierly was for the moment absent from the  porch where they had seated themselves with their cigars, Ferrars  asked--    \"Where does the lady live who drove Mr. Doran's black pony yesterday. Is  it at an hotel?\"    \"It is at the Glenville, an aristocratic family hotel on the terrace.  She is a Mrs. Jamieson.\"    \"Do you know her?\"    \"She sent for me once to prescribe for some small ailment not long ago.\"    \"Has she been summoned?\"    \"She will be.\"    \"If there was any one in the woods, or approaching the mound by the road  from the south, she should have seen them, or him; even a boat might  have been seen through the trees for some distance southward, could it  not?\"    \"Yes. For two miles from the town the lake is visible from the wood  road. Ah! here comes Doran and our constable.\"    For half an hour the doctor was busy with Doran, the constable, and a  number of other men who had or wished to have some small part to play in  this second act of the tragedy, the end of which no one could foresee.  Then, having dispatched them on their various missions, the doctor set  out to inquire after the welfare of Hilda Grant; and Robert Brierly, who  could not endure his suspense and sorrow in complete inaction, asked  permission to accompany him, thus leaving the detective, who was quite  in the mood for a little solitude just then, in possession of the porch,  three wicker chairs and his cigar.    But not for long. Before he had smoked and wrinkled his brows, as was  his habit when things were not developing to his liking, and pondered  ten minutes alone, he heard the click of the front gate, and turned in  his chair to see a lady, petite, graceful, and dressed in mourning,  coming toward him with quick, light steps. She was looking straight at  him as she came, but as he rose at her approach, she stopped short, and  standing a few steps from the porch, said crisply--    \"Your pardon. I have made a mistake. I am looking for Doctor Barnes.\"    \"He has gone out for a short time only. Will you be seated, madam, and  wait?\"    She advanced a step and stopped irresolute.    \"I suppose I must, unless,\" coming close to the lower step, \"unless you  can tell me, sir, what I wish to know.\"    \"If it is a question of medicine, madam, I fear----\"    \"It is not,\" she broke in, her voice dropping to a lower note. \"It is  about the--the inquiry or examination into the death of the poor young  man who--but you know, of course.\"    \"I have heard. The inquest is held at one o'clock.\"    \"Ah! And do you know if the--the witnesses have been notified as yet?\"    \"They are being summoned now. As the doctor's guest I have but lately  heard him sending out the papers.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" The lady put a tiny foot upon the step as if to mount, and  then withdrew it. \"I think, if I may leave a message with you, sir,\" she  said, \"I will not wait.\"    \"Most certainly,\" he replied.    \"I chanced to be driving through the wood yesterday when the body was  discovered near the Indian Mound, and am told that I shall be wanted as  a witness. I do not understand why.\"    \"Possibly a mere form, which is nevertheless essential.\"    \"I had engaged to go out with a yachting party,\" she went on, \"and  before I withdraw from the excursion I wish to be sure that I shall  really be required. My name is Mrs. Jamieson, and----\"    \"Then I can assure you, Mrs. Jamieson, that you are, or will be wanted,  at least. My friend has sent a summons to a Mrs. Jamieson of the  Glenville House.\"    \"That is myself,\" the lady said, and turned to go. \"Of course then I  must be at hand.\"    She nodded slightly and went away, going with a less appearance of haste  down the street and so from his sight.    When she was no longer visible the detective resumed his seat, and  relighted his cigar, making, as he did so, this very unprofessional  comment--    \"I hate to lose sight of a pretty woman, until I am sure of the colour  of her eyes.\"    And yet Francis Ferrars had never been called, in any sense, a \"ladies'  man.\"          CHAPTER VII.    RENUNCIATION.      Ferrars had predicted that nothing would be gained by the inquest, and  the result proved him a prophet.    Peter Kramer, the poor half-wit who had given the first clue to the  whereabouts of the murdered man, was found, and his confidence won by  much coaxing, and more sweets and shining pennies, the only coin which  Peter would ever recognise as such. But the result was small. Asked had  he seen the teacher, the reply was, \"Yep.\" Asked where, \"Most by Injun  hill.\" Asked what doing, \"Settin' down.\"    \"Had he heard the pistol fired?\" asked the doctor.    \"Un! Uh! Heard nawthin.\"    \"And whom did you see, Peter, besides the teacher?\"    Again the look of affright in the dull eyes, the arm lifted as in  self-protection, and the only word they could coax from his lips was,  \"Ghost!\" uttered in evident fear and trembling.    And this was repeated at the inquest. This, and no more, from Peter.    Mrs. Fry, Charles Brierly's landlady, told how the dead man had appeared  at breakfast, and her testimony did not accord with the statement of her  little daughter.    \"Miss Grant has told me of my little girl's mistake,\" she said. \"Mr.  Brierly was down-stairs unusually early that morning, and he did not  look quite as well as usual. He looked worried, in fact, and ate little.  He was always a small eater, and I said something about his eating even  less than usual, I can't recall the exact words. Nellie of course, did  not observe his worried look, as I did, and quoted me wrong. Mr. Brierly  left the house at once after leaving the table. I did not think of it at  first, but it came to me this morning that as he did not carry any books  with him, he must of course have meant to come back for them, and----\"  She paused.    \"And, of course,\" suggested the coroner, \"he must have had his pistol  upon his person when he came down to breakfast? Is that your meaning?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    The weapon, found near the dead man's hand as it had doubtless fallen  from it, was there in evidence, as it had been picked up with two of the  chambers empty.    That it was not a case of murder for plunder was proven, or so they  thought, by the fact that the dead man's watch was found upon his  person; his pockets containing a small sum of money, pencils, knives,  note book, a small picture case, closed with a spring, and containing  Hilda Grant's picture, and a letter from his brother.    Hilda Grant's brief testimony did not agree with that of Mrs. Fry.    "]]]
