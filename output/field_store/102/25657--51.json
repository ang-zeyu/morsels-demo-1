He was a profuse blasphemer of  God and His saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all  men the most irascible. He was never seen at Church, held all the sacraments  vile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry. On the other  hand he resorted readily to the tavern and other places of evil repute, and  frequented them. He was as fond of women as a dog is of the stick: in the  use against nature he had not his match among the most abandoned. He would  have pilfered and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make  an oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his cups,  whereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and suffering. He was  also a practised gamester and thrower of false dice. But why enlarge so much  upon him? Enough that he was, perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.    The rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this reprobate's  mainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate treatment on  the part of the private persons whom he frequently, and the court which he  unremittingly, outraged. So Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser  Cepparello, with whose way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him  to be the very sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He  therefore sent for him, and thus addressed him:--\"Ser Ciappelletto, I am, as  thou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among those with whom  I have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians, very wily knaves; nor  know I the man whom I could more fitly entrust with the recovery of my money  than thyself. Wherefore, as thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt  undertake this business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and  give thee a reasonable part of what thou shalt recover.\" Ser Ciappelletto,  being out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and about to  lose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without the least demur,  for in truth he had hardly any choice, made his mind up and answered that he  was ready to go. So the bargain was struck. Armed with the power of attorney  and the royal letters commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer  Musciatto and hied him to Burgundy, where he was hardly known to a soul. He  set about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery of the  money, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his nature, as if he  were minded to reserve his severity to the last. While thus occupied, he was  frequently at the house of two Florentine usurers, who treated him with  great distinction out of regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so  happened that he fell sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and  servants in attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the  restoration of his health. But all remedies proved unavailing; for being now  old, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly life, he went  daily from bad to worse like one stricken with a mortal disease. This  greatly disconcerted the two brothers; and one day, hard by the room in  which Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began to talk about him; saying one to  the other:--\"What shall we do with this man? We are hard bested indeed on  his account. If we turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not  only incur grave censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk  must know the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with  which we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during which  time he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet they would see  him suddenly turned out of our house sick unto death. On the other hand he  has been so bad a man that he is sure not to confess or receive any of the  Church's sacraments; and dying thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in  church, but will be cast out into some ditch like a dog; nay, 'twill be all  one if he do confess, for such and so horrible have been his crimes that no  friar or priest either will or can absolve him; and so, dying without  absolution, he will still be cast out into the ditch. In which case the folk  of these parts, who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day  long, and would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a  tumult, and make a raid upon our houses, crying:--'Away with these Lombard  whom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly strip us of our  goods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any case we stand to lose  if this man die.\"    Ser Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they thus spoke,  and whose hearing was sharpened, as is often the case, by his malady,  overheard all that they said about him. So he called them to him, and said  to them:--\"I would not have you disquiet yourselves in regard of me, or  apprehend loss to befall you by my death. I have heard what you have said of  me and have no doubt that 'twould be as you say, if matters took the course  you anticipate; but I am minded that it shall be otherwise. I have committed  so many offences against God in the course of my life, that one more in the  hour of my death will make no difference whatever to the account. So seek  out and bring hither the worthiest and most holy friar you can find, and  leave me to settle your affairs and mine upon a sound and solid basis, with  which you may rest satisfied.\" The two brothers had not much hope of the  result, but yet they went to a friary and asked for a holy and discreet man  to hear the confession of a Lombard that was sick in their house, and  returned with an aged man of just and holy life, very learned in the  Scriptures, and venerable and held in very great and especial reverence by  all the citizens. As soon as he had entered the room where Ser Ciappelletto  was lying, and had taken his place by his side, he began gently to comfort  him: then he asked him how long it was since he was confessed. Whereto Ser  Ciappelletto, who had never been confessed, answered:--\"Father, it is my  constant practice to be confessed at least once a week, and many a week I am  confessed more often; but true it is, that, since I have been sick, now  eight days, I have made no confession, so sore has been my affliction.  \"Son,\" said the friar, \"thou hast well done, and well for thee, if so thou  continue to do; as thou dost confess so often, I see that my labour of  hearkening and questioning will be slight.\" \"Nay but, master friar,\" said  Ser Ciappelletto, \"I say not so; I have not confessed so often but that I  would fain make a general confession of all my sins that I have committed,  so far as I can recall them, from the day of my birth to the present time;  and therefore I pray you, my good father, to question me precisely in every  particular just as if I had never been confessed. And spare me not by reason  of my sickness, for I had far rather do despite to my flesh than, sparing  it, risk the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour redeemed with His  precious blood.\"    The holy man was mightily delighted with these words, which seemed to him to  betoken a soul in a state of grace. He therefore signified to Ser  Ciappelletto his high approval of this practice; and then began by asking  him whether he had ever sinned carnally with a woman. Whereto Ser  Ciappelletto answered with a sigh:--\"My father, I scruple to tell you the  truth in this matter, fearing lest I sin in vain-glory.\" \"Nay, but,\" said  the friar, \"speak boldly; none ever sinned by telling the truth, either in  confession or otherwise.\" \"Then,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"as you bid me  speak boldly, I will tell you the truth of this matter. I am virgin even as  when I issued from my mother's womb.\" \"Now God's blessing on thee,\" said the  friar, \"well done; and the greater is thy merit in that, hadst thou so  willed, thou mightest have done otherwise far more readily than we who are  under constraint of rule.\" He then proceeded to ask, whether he had offended  God by gluttony. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto, heaving a heavy sigh, answered  that he had so offended for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other  devout persons, but at least thrice days in every week, taking nothing but  bread and water, he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much  enjoyment, more particularly when fatigued by devotion or pilgrimage, as  great drinkers quaff their wine; and oftentimes he had felt a craving for  such dainty dishes of herbs as ladies make when they go into the country,  and now and again he had relished his food more than seemed to him meet in  one who fasted, as he did, for devotion. \"Son,\" said the friar, \"these sins  are natural and very trifling; and therefore I would not have thee burden  thy conscience too much with them. There is no man, however holy he may be,  but must sometimes find it pleasant to eat after a long fast and to drink  after exertion.\" \"O, my father,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"say not this to  comfort me. You know well that I know, that the things which are done in the  service of God ought to be done in perfect purity of an unsullied spirit;  and whoever does otherwise sins.\" The friar, well content, replied:--\"Glad I  am that thou dost think so, and I am mightily pleased with thy pure and good  conscience which therein appears; but tell me: hast thou sinned by avarice,  coveting more than was reasonable, or withholding more than was right? My  father,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"I would not have you disquiet yourself,  because I am in the house of these usurers: no part have I in their  concerns; nay, I did but come here to admonish and reprehend them, and wean  them from this abominable traffic; and so, I believe, I had done, had not  God"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#9)"],[1,"observe, then, from her appearing dull and apathetic, refusing her  food, taking to dark corners, or sleeping all day, without attempting to  go out of doors; and, especially if her coat is dry; catch her at once,  and give her an emetic.  Try a little salt and water first, and, if that  will not act, two grains of sulphate of zinc will, given in luke-warm  water.  Afterwards administer as much castor-oil as you would give to a  baby, or two or three grains of grey powder.  Such treatment, taken in  time, will often have the effect of cutting short a serious illness.    _Operations_.--Never hesitate to open an abscess if you think, or  rather, if you are about half sure, there is matter in it.  Afterwards  foment with warm water.  Poultices are unhandy.  If the cat's leg has  been severely lacerated and broken in a trap, and there seems little  likelihood of its being able to heal, cut it off.  Do it quietly,  gently, and firmly; the ragged edge of the bone may be sawn off with a  table-knife made into a saw with a file.  (I cut a man's finger off the  other day with the same instrument.  About a fortnight after, the  commander, sitting at luncheon, made the innocent remark: \"This knife is  rather blunt, steward.  I'm hanged!\" he roared, immediately after, as he  dashed the knife through the open port, \"I'm hanged if it isn't the  doctor's saw!\")    Be sure to leave enough flesh to form a flap to cover the bone; stop the  bleeding with the actual cautery, then sew up and dress the wound in  sticking plaster; only leave room for the egress of matter.  Painful  operations of this sort are always better performed under chloroform.    Lay the cat on her side (rolled in the shawl) on some one else's knee,  pour a little chloroform into a handkerchief, and hold it _near, not on_  pussy's nose, or you will smother her.  As soon as one portion of the  chloroform gets evaporated supply its place with more; in from five to  ten minutes pussy will be in the land of nod.    _Consumption_.--Consumption in the cat is curable, because it is not  necessarily disease of the lungs.  The term is used to denote all sorts  of wasting disease in which pussy falls away in flesh, in coat, and in  general health.  The treatment must be careful--regulation of the diet  and attention to her housing, an occasional mild purgative and dose of  sulphur-butter.  You may give her raw meat steeped in wine if she will  take it; but remember your great sheet-anchor in the care of all these  cases is _cod-liver oil_, a dessert spoonful every day, or even more.  And you may supplement the treatment most advantageously by giving,  twice a day, the sixth of a grain of quinine.    One word of warning to cat-fanciers before I close this chapter.  _Never  ask a veterinary surgeon about your cat_.  Their knowledge of canine  ailments is vastly behind the times; their knowledge of cat diseases is  simply and literally _carte blanche_.  If you want your pussy killed or  tormented to death, _go to a chemist_.  The chemists in this country,  through their ignorance, and impudent assumption of medical knowledge,  slay their thousands annually.  Their ignorant patients, however, go  with their eyes open, and place themselves in chemists' hands.  Well, as  a paternal government refuses to protect the people, let the chemists go  ahead and poison away; but, if warning of mine will be heard and heeded,  they shall not poison our pussies too.    CHAPTER TEN.    DISEASES OF CATS--CONTINUED.    Probably one of the commonest and most distressing of complaints in the  cat is _diarrhoea_; and what makes it all the more distressing, is the  fact that, instead of receiving sympathy and good treatment in her  distress, she is often harshly treated, kicked about, and thrust out of  doors.    Diarrhoea is usually brought about by want of regular feeding, by  improper food, and exposure to wet and cold.  Different sorts of food  will also induce it--such as rancid horseflesh, sour milk, an  over-allowance of fat or liver.  If taken at once, the treatment is  generally very successful; if let go on too long, the cat will rapidly  lose flesh; and the advent of dysentery will make it a charity to put  her out of the way.    Give her at first a small teaspoonful of castor-oil, to which add two  drops of solution of muriate of morphia.  This will often stop it, and  remove all offending matter from the intestines.  If there is no  improvement, repeat the dose on the second morning, and give small doses  of common chalk mixture three times a day, with two drops of laudanum  divided between the three doses.  Let her have nothing but bread and  milk to eat, or a little corn-flour, if she will take it; if not, give  her fish--she won't refuse that.    A few drops of solution of lime added to her milk will do good.    If she be very much reduced in weight, and has no appetite, try two  grains of quinine made into twelve pills with breadcrumb: dose, one  three times a day.  Or you may give cod-liver oil.    _Dysentery_ is a frequent sequel to badly-treated diarrhoea.  It is  simply ulceration of the coats of the bowels, combined with great  emaciation, roughness of coat, dejected look, and loss of appetite.  Unless a very valuable cat, I would not advise you to keep her alive.  You may, however, with patience, bring her round.  Give her, then, a  grain or two of calomel occasionally, and quinine three times a day,  unless she exhibits any tendency to fits.  House her well, and give her  the most generous of diet--raw meat, eggs, etc, and a little port wine  daily, or even a small quantity of brandy.    _Gastritis_, or inflammation of the stomach, is by no means rare in the  cat, and is frequently the result of poison having been given with the  hope of causing death.  The cat simply pines, and gets thin, and refuses  nearly all food, which, when she does eat, causes pain, sickness, and  vomiting.  The bowels, too, are often disordered.  There is nothing  better, in these cases, than the tris-nitrate of bismuth, from one to  three grains to be placed on the tongue twice or thrice daily.  You may  also give occasionally a grain or two of calomel with a little rhubarb  powder.    If there is much emaciation, cod-liver oil may be tried, and a small  allowance of raw meat, cut into little bits; and quinine.    _Bronchitis_.--This is a much more common and dangerous disease than is  generally supposed.  It often attacks cats at a particular age--say, six  or eight months--and, indeed, is somewhat analogous to distemper in the  dog.  It is ushered in by the usual symptoms of a bad cold--staring  coat, watery eyes, and a slight cough.  If the disease be confined to  the lining membranes of the nose and throat, there will be but little  cough, but it usually attacks the bronchi (windpipes) themselves.  There  is pain, a slight swelling of the nose, and mattery exudation from both  nose and eyes.  After a few days of the acute comes _the chronic stage_.  Pussy is now a very wretched and unhappy little object indeed.  She  wanders about the house coughing continually, with her little tongue  protruding.  She gets rapidly thin, and refuses all food; and, if not  attended to, generally seeks some quiet, dark corner in which to die.    _Treatment_.--Great good can be done in the first stage by hot  fomentations applied across the face.  These must be frequent, or they  are of no avail.  Keep pussy indoors, and at first let her diet be low--  simply bread and milk, and occasionally fish.  Give her castor-oil  alone, if there is no diarrhoea; if there is, add to the dose two drops  of solution of muriate of morphia.    As the disease gets chronic, and pussy begins to lose flesh, do  everything you can to support her strength by beef-tea, nourishing food,  and wine.  If the cough is troublesome, get her the following,  compounded by your own chemist:--R. Extr. conii, Pil. scillae, co. aa.,  gr. xv.; Camph., gr. xx.  Mix and make into twenty-four pills, and give  one night and morning.    Latterly give cod-liver oil to complete the cure, which, in this case,  will act like magic.    If the mange is present in any shape, it must be carefully seen to as  directed under that heading.    _Fits_.--These are by no means uncommon among our domestic cats.  They  are of various kinds--fainting fits, delirious fits, and convulsive  fits.    The former are usually caused by weakness, exposure to the weather, and  general ill-treatment, or loss of blood.  All that is required during  the fit is rest and exposure to a current of cool air.  After the fit  you ought to set about getting pussy's bodily health into better  condition by good food, tonics, and oil.    _Delirious_ fits are those in which the poor cat, through mental or  bodily suffering, apparently goes wild, dashing madly through the house,  springing through a window, and finally hiding herself away in some dark  corner.  You must catch her and put her into a quiet room, and do all  you can to soothe her.  Apply smelling-salts to the nostrils, and bleed.  This operation is easily performed by making a puncture through any of  the small veins inside the ear, and fomenting in hot water.  An emetic--  if the cat is not insensible--will, in all probability, do good, as,  both in the delirious and convulsive fits, the stomach and bowels are  generally out of order.    _Convulsive Fits_.--The cat emits a cry as of pain and terror, and falls  down on her side, foaming at the mouth, and with convulsive motions of  all the limbs, accompanied with cries and moans.  Usually ends in a  delirious fit.  During the fit do nothing at all, except prevent pussy  from injuring herself or any one else; and do this gently and firmly.  A  pinch of snuff or smelling-bottle applied to the nose can do no harm.  Afterwards bleed, and keep her in a quiet, cool room, and treat as for  the delirious fit above described.  When pussy has recovered--and  especially if she has"]]]
