We have not dropped the  fortunate expression from any want of its use, but of perception in our  lexicographers. The celebrated Marquis of Lansdowne introduced a useful  word, which has of late been warmly adopted in France as well as in  England--_to liberalise_; the noun has been drawn out of the verb--for  in the marquis's time that was only an abstract conception which is now  a sect; and to _liberalise_ was theoretically introduced before the  _liberals_ arose.[28] It is curious to observe that as an adjective it  had formerly in our language a very opposite meaning to its recent one.  It was synonymous with \"libertine or licentious;\" we have \"a _liberal_  villain\" and \"a most profane and _liberal_ counsellor;\" we find one  declaring \"I have spoken _too liberally_.\" This is unlucky for the  _liberals_, who will not--      Give allowance to our _liberal_ jests    Upon their persons--         BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.    Dr. Priestley employed a forcible, but not an elegant term, to mark the  general information which had begun in his day; this he frequently calls  \"the _spread_ of knowledge.\" Burke attempted to brand with a new name  that set of pert, petulant, sophistical sciolists, whose philosophy the  French, since their revolutionary period, have distinguished as  _philosophism_, and the philosophers themselves as _philosophistes_. He  would have designated them as _literators_, but few exotic words will  circulate; new words must be the coinage of our own language to blend  with the vernacular idiom. Many new words are still wanted. We have no  word by which we could translate the _otium_ of the Latins, the  _dillettante_ of the Italians, the _alembique_ of the French, as an  epithet to describe that sublimated ingenuity which exhausts the mind,  till, like the fusion of the diamond, the intellect itself disappears. A  philosopher, in an extensive view of a subject in all its bearings, may  convey to us the result of his last considerations by the coinage of a  novel and significant expression, as this of Professor Dugald  Stewart--_political religionism_. Let me claim the honour of one pure  neologism. I ventured to introduce the term of FATHER-LAND to describe  our _natale solum_; I have lived to see it adopted by Lord Byron and by  Mr. Southey, and the word is now common. A lady has even composed both  the words and the air of a song on \"Father-land.\" This energetic  expression may therefore be considered as authenticated; and patriotism  may stamp it with its glory and its affection. FATHER-LAND is congenial  with the language in which we find that other fine expression  MOTHER-TONGUE. The patriotic neologism originated with me in Holland,  when, in early life, it was my daily pursuit to turn over the glorious  history of its independence under the title of _Vaderlandsche  Historie_--the history of FATHER-LAND!    If we acknowledge that the creation of some neologisms may sometimes  produce the beautiful, the revival of the dead is the more authentic  miracle; for a new word must long remain doubtful, but an ancient word  happily recovered rests on a basis of permanent strength; it has both  novelty and authority. A collection of _picturesque words_, found among  our ancient writers, would constitute a precious supplement to the  history of our language. Far more expressive than our term of  _executioner_ is their solemn one of the _deathsman_; than our  _vagabond_, their _scatterling_; than our _idiot_ or _lunatic_, their  _moonling_,--a word which, Mr. Gifford observes, should not have been  suffered to grow obsolete. Herrick finely describes by the term  _pittering_ the peculiar shrill and short cry of the grasshopper: the  cry of the grasshopper is pit! pit! pit! quickly repeated. Envy  \"_dusking_ the lustre\" of genius is a verb lost for us, but which gives  a more precise expression to the feeling than any other words which we  could use.    The late Dr. Boucher, in the prospectus of his proposed Dictionary, did  me the honour, then a young writer, to quote an opinion I had formed  early in life of the purest source of neology, which is in the _revival  of old words_.      Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake!    We have lost many exquisite and picturesque expressions through the  dulness of our lexicographers, or by the deficiency in that profounder  study of our writers which their labours require far more than they  themselves know. The natural graces of our language have been  impoverished. The genius that throws its prophetic eye over the  language, and the taste that must come from Heaven, no lexicographer  imagines are required to accompany him amidst a library of old books!

[21] This verse was corrected by Bentley _procudere nummum_, instead      of _producere nomen_, which the critics agree is one of his happy      conjectures.      [22] Henry Cockeram's curious little \"English Dictionarie, or an      Interpretation of hard English words\", 12mo, 1631, professes to give      in its first book \"the choicest words themselves now in use,      wherewith our language is inriched and become so copious.\" Many have      not survived, such as the following:--          Acyrologicall    An improper speech.        Adacted          Driven in by force.        Blandiloquy      Flattering speech.        Compaginate      To set together that which is broken.        Concessation     Loytering.        Delitigate       To scold, or chide vehemently.        Depalmate        To give one a box on the ear.        Esuriate         To hunger.        Strenuitie       Activity.        Curiously enough, this author notes some words as those \"now out of      use, and onely used of some ancient writers,\" but which we now      commonly use. Such are the following:--          Abandon          To forsake or cast off.        Abate            To make lesse, diminish, or take from.      [23] A most striking instance of the change of meaning in a word is      in the old law-term _let_--\"without _let_ or hindrance;\" meaning      void of all opposition. Hence, \"I will _let_ you,\" meant \"I will      hinder you;\" and not as we should now think, \"I will give you free      leave.\"      [24] Shakspeare makes \"Ancient Pistol\" use a new-coined Italian      word, when he speaks of being \"better accommodated;\" to the great      delight of Justice Shallow, who exclaims, \"It comes from      _accommodo_--a good phrase!\" And Ben Jonson, in his \"Tale of a Tub,\"      ridicules Inigo Jones's love of two words he often used:--                       ----If it _conduce_        To the design, whate'er is _feasible_,        I can express.      [25] The term _pluck_, once only known to the prize-ring, has now      got into use in general conversation, and also into literature, as a      term indicative of ready courage.      [26] Such terms as \"_patent_ to the public\"--\"_normal_      condition\"--\"_crass_ behaviour,\" are the inventions of the last few      years.      [27] Shakspeare has a powerfully-composed line in the speech of the      Duke of Burgundy, (_Henry V._ Act v. Sc. 2), when, describing the      fields overgrown with weeds, he exclaims--                             ----The coulter rusts,        That should _deracinate_ such _savagery_.      [28] The \"Quarterly Review\" recently marked the word _liberalise_ in      italics as a strange word, undoubtedly not aware of its origin. It      has been lately used by Mr. Dugald Stewart, \"to _liberalise_ the      views.\"--Dissert. 2nd part, p. 138.          THE PHILOSOPHY OF PROVERBS.      In antique furniture we sometimes discover a convenience which long  disuse had made us unacquainted with, and are surprised by the aptness  which we did not suspect was concealed in its solid forms. We have found  the labour of the workmen to have been as admirable as the material  itself, which is still resisting the mouldering touch of time among  those modern inventions, elegant and unsubstantial, which, often put  together with unseasoned wood, are apt to warp and fly into pieces when  brought into use. We have found how strength consists in the selection  of materials, and that, whenever the substitute is not better than the  original, we are losing something in that test of experience, which all  things derive from duration.    Be this as it may! I shall not unreasonably await for the artists of our  novelties to retrograde into massive greatness, although I cannot avoid  reminding them how often they revive the forgotten things of past times!  It is well known that many of our novelties were in use by our  ancestors! In the history of the human mind there is, indeed, a sort of  antique furniture which I collect, not merely for their antiquity, but  for the sound condition in which I still find them, and the compactness  which they still show. Centuries have not worm-eaten their solidity! and  the utility and delightfulness which they still afford make them look as  fresh and as ingenious as any of our patent inventions.    By the title of the present article the reader has anticipated the  nature of the old furniture to which I allude. I propose to give what,  in the style of our times, may be called the Philosophy of Proverbs--a  topic which seems virgin. The art of reading proverbs has not, indeed,  always been acquired even by some of their admirers; but my  observations, like their subject, must be versatile and unconnected; and  I must bespeak indulgence for an attempt to illustrate a very curious  branch of literature, rather not understood than quite forgotten.    Proverbs have long been in disuse. \"A man of fashion,\" observes Lord  Chesterfield, \"never has recourse to proverbs and vulgar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#9)"],[1,"see  anything particular about you. The stars have not thought of that;  they think that everything which shines has, at least, a wax-candle in  it. But now I am tired,\" said the wind, \"I will now lie down;\" and so  it lay down to rest.    The next day--yes, the next day we will spring over: the next evening  the lamp lay in the arm chair,--and where? At the old watchman's. He  had, for his long and faithful services, begged of the authorities  that he might be allowed to keep the old lamp; they laughed at him  when he begged for it, and then gave him it; and now the lamp lay in  the arm-chair, close by the warm stove, and it was really just as if  it had become larger on that account,--it almost filled the whole  chair. The old folks now sat at their supper, and cast mild looks at  the old lamp, which they would willingly have given a place at the  table with them. It is true they lived in a cellar, a yard or so below  ground: one had to go through a paved front-room to come into the room  they lived in; but it was warm here, for there was list round the door  to keep it so. It looked clean and neat, with curtains round the bed  and over the small windows, where two strange-looking flowerpots stood  on the sill. Christian, the sailor, had brought them from the East or  West Indies; they were of clay in the form of two elephants, the backs  of which were wanting: but in their place there came flourishing  plants out of the earth that was in them; in the one was the finest  chive,--It was the old folks' kitchen-garden,--and in the other was a  large flowering geranium--this was their flower-garden. On the wall  hung a large colored print of \"The Congress of Vienna;\" there they had  all the kings and emperors at once. A Bornholm* clock, with heavy  leaden weights went \"tic-tac!\" and always too fast; but the old folks  said it was better than if it went too slow. They ate their suppers,  and the old lamp, as we have said, lay in the armchair close by the  warm stove. It was, for the old lamp, as if the whole world was turned  upside down. But when the old watchman looked at it, and spoke about  what they had lived to see with each other, in rain and drizzle, in  the clear, short summer nights, and when the snow drove about so that  it was good to get into the pent-house of the cellar,--then all was  again in order for the old lamp, it saw it all just as if it were now  present;--yes! the wind had blown it up right well,--it had  enlightened it.    ------    * Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic is famous for its  manufactures of clocks, potteries, and cement; it contains also  considerable coal mines, though not worked to any extent. It is  fertile in minerals, chalks, potters' clay of the finest quality, and  other valuable natural productions; but, on account of the jealous  nature of the inhabitants, which deters foreigners from settling  there, these productions are not made so available or profitable as  they otherwise might be.    ------    The old folks were so clever and industrious, not an hour was quietly  dozed away; on Sunday afternoons some book was always brought forth,  particularly a book of travels, and the old man read aloud about  Africa, about the great forests and the elephants that were there  quite wild; and the old woman listened so attentively, and now and  then took a side glance at the clay elephants--her flower-pots. \"I can  almost imagine it!\" said she; and the lamp wished so much that there  was a wax candle to light and be put in it, so that she could plainly  see everything just as the lamp saw it; the tall trees, the thick  branches twining into one another, the black men on horseback, and  whole trains of elephants, which, with their broad feet, crushed the  canes and bushes.    \"Of what use are all my abilities when there is no wax candle?\" sighed  the lamp; \"they have only train oil and tallow candles, and they are  not sufficient.\"    One day there came a whole bundle of stumps of wax candles into the  cellar, the largest pieces were burnt, and the old woman used the  smaller pieces to wax her thread with when she sewed; there were wax  candle ends, but they never thought of putting a little piece in the  lamp.    \"Here I stand with my rare abilities,\" said the lamp; \"I have  everything within me, but I cannot share any part with them. They know  not that I can transform the white walls to the prettiest  paper-hangings, to rich forests, to everything that they may wish for.  They know it not!\"    For the rest, the lamp stood in a corner, where it always met the eye,  and it was neat and well scoured; folks certainly said it was an old  piece of rubbish; but the old man and his wife didn't care about that,  they were fond of the lamp.    One day it was the old watchman's birth day; the old woman came up to  the lamp, smiled, and said, \"I will illuminate for him,\" and the  lamp's cowl creaked, for it thought, \"They will now be enlightened!\"  But she put in train oil, and no wax candle; it burnt the whole  evening; but now it knew that the gift which the stars had given it,  the best gift of all, was a dead treasure for this life. It then  dreamt--and when one has such abilities, one can surely dream,--that  the old folks were dead, and that it had come to an ironfounder's to  be cast anew; it was in as much anxiety as when it had to go to the  town-hall to be examined by the authorities; but although it had the  power to fall to pieces in rust and dust, when it wished it, yet it  did not do it; and so it came into the furnace and was re-cast as a  pretty iron candlestick, in which any one might set a wax candle. It  had the form of an angel, bearing a nosegay, and in the centre of the  nosegay they put a wax taper and it was placed on a green  writing-table; and the room was so snug and comfortable: there hung  beautiful pictures--there stood many books; it was at a poet's, and  everything that he wrote, unveiled itself round about: the room became  a deep, dark forest,--a sun-lit meadow where the stork stalked about;  and a ship's deck high aloft on the swelling sea!    \"What power I have!\" said the old lamp, as it awoke. \"I almost long to  be re-cast;--but no, it must not be as long as the old folks live.  They are fond of me for the sake of my person. I am to them as a  child, and they have scoured me, and they have given me train oil.  After all, I am as well off as 'The Congress,'--which is something so  very grand.\"    From that time it had more inward peace, which was merited by the old  street-lamp.    ------------        THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK.    Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but  that was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant  it for Charles, and it is all well enough if one do but know it. He  had now to take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much less  than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same  time; but these two things would not do together at all. There sat the  poor little fellow with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all  the songs he knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the  geography-book that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to  have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them  all that is possible to be known.    His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little  Augusta on her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly  that he pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker,  but his mother had no money to buy a candle.    \"There goes the old washerwoman over the way,\" said his mother, as she  looked out of the window. \"The poor woman can hardly drag herself  along, and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain: be a  good boy, Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?\"    So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again  into the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no  thought of such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old  turn-up bedstead; in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson,  and of Zealand, and of all that his master had told him. He ought, to  be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he  could not do. He therefore put his geography-book under his pillow,  because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants  to learn one's lesson; but one cannot, however, rely upon it entirely.  Well there he lay, and thought an thought, and all at once it was just  as if some one kissed his eyes and mouth: he slept, and yet he did not  sleep; it was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild  eyes and said, \"It were a great sin if you were not to know your  lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided me, I therefore will now help  you; and the loving God will do so at all times.\" And all of a sudden  the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and scratching.    \"Kickery-ki! kluk! kluk! kluk!\"--that was an old hen who came creeping  along, and she was from Kjoge. I am a Kjoger hen,\"* said she, and then  she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the  battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth  talking about.    ------    * Kjoge a town in the bay of Kjoge \"To see the Kjoge hens,\" is an  expression similar to \"showing a child London,\" which is said to be  done by taking his head in both hands, and so lifting him off the  ground. At the invasion of the English in 1807, an encounter of a no  very glorious nature took place between the British troops and the  undisciplined Danish militia.    ------    \"Kribledy, krabledy--plump!\" down fell somebody: it was a wooden bird,  the popinjay used at the shooting-matches at Prastoe. Now _he_ said  that there were just as many inhabitants as he had nails in his body;  and he was very proud. \"Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.*  Plump! here I lie"]]]
