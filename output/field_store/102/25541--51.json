At the turn to the straight     Where the favourites fail,    And every atom of weight     Is telling its tale;    As some grim old stayer hard-pressed     Runs true to his breed,    And with head just in front of the rest     Fights on in the lead;    When the jockeys are out with the whips,     With a furlong to go;    And the backers grow white to the lips --     Do you think THEY don't know?      Do they know?  As they come back to weigh     In a whirlwind of cheers,    Though the spurs have left marks of the fray,     Though the sweat on the ears    Gathers cold, and they sob with distress     As they roll up the track,    They know just as well their success     As the man on their back.    As they walk through a dense human lane,     That sways to and fro,    And cheers them again and again,     Do you think THEY don't know?          The Passing of Gundagai          'I'll introdooce a friend!' he said,     And if you've got a vacant pen    You'd better take him in the shed    And start him shearing straight ahead,     He's one of these here quiet men.      'He never strikes -- that ain't his game;     No matter what the others try    HE goes on shearing just the same.    I never rightly knew his name --     We always call him \"Gundagai\"!'      Our flashest shearer then had gone     To train a racehorse for a race,    And while his sporting fit was on    He couldn't be relied upon,     So 'Gundagai' shore in his place.      Alas for man's veracity!     For reputations false and true!    This 'Gundagai' turned out to be,    For strife and all-round villainy,     The very worst I ever knew!      He started racing Jack Devine,     And grumbled when I made him stop.    The pace he showed was extra fine,    But all those pure-bred ewes of mine     Were bleeding like a butcher's shop.      He cursed the sheep, he cursed the shed,     From roof to rafter, floor to shelf;    As for my mongrel ewes, he said,    I ought to get a razor blade     And shave the blooming things myself.      On Sundays he controlled a 'school',     And played 'two-up' the livelong day;    And many a young confiding fool    He shore of his financial wool;     And when he lost he would not pay.      He organised a shearers' race,     And 'touched' me to provide the prize.    His packhorse showed surprising pace    And won hands down -- he was The Ace,     A well-known racehorse in disguise.      Next day the bruiser of the shed     Displayed an opal-tinted eye,    With large contusions on his head.    He smiled a sickly smile, and said     He'd 'had a cut at \"Gundagai\"!'      But just as we were getting full     Of 'Gundagai' and all his ways,    A telegram for 'Henry Bull'    Arrived.  Said he, 'That's me -- all wool!     Let's see what this here message says.'      He opened it, his face grew white,     He dropped the shears and turned away.    It ran, 'Your wife took bad last night;    Come home at once -- no time to write,     We fear she may not last the day.'      He got his cheque -- I didn't care     To dock him for my mangled ewes;    His store account -- we 'called it square'.    Poor wretch! he had enough to bear,     Confronted by such dreadful news.      The shearers raised a little purse     To help a mate, as shearers will,    'To pay the doctor and the nurse,    And if there should be something worse --     To pay the undertaker's bill.'      They wrung his hand in sympathy,     He rode away without a word,    His head hung down in misery.    A wandering hawker passing by     Was told of what had just occurred.      'Well! that's a curious thing,' he said,     'I've known that feller all his life --    He's had the loan of this here shed!    I know his wife ain't nearly dead,     Because he HASN'T GOT A WIFE!'           .    .    .    .    .      You should have heard the whipcord crack     As angry shearers galloped by,    In vain they tried to fetch him back.    A little dust along the track     Was all they saw of 'Gundagai'.          The Wargeilah Handicap          Wargeilah town is very small,     There's no cathedral nor a club,    In fact the township, all in all,     Is just one unpretentious pub;    And there, from all the stations round,    The local sportsmen can be found.      The sportsmen of Wargeilah side     Are very few but very fit:    There's scarcely any sport been tried     But what they held their own at it    In fact, to search their records o'er,    They held their own and something more.      'Twas round about Wargeilah town     An English new-chum did infest:    He used to wander up and down     In baggy English breeches drest --    His mental aspect seemed to be    Just stolid self-sufficiency.      The local sportsmen vainly sought     His tranquil calm to counteract,    By urging that he should be brought     Within the Noxious Creatures Act.    'Nay, harm him not,' said one more wise,    'He is a blessing in disguise!      'You see, he wants to buy a horse,     To ride, and hunt, and steeplechase,    And carry ladies, too, of course,     And pull a cart and win a race.    Good gracious! he must be a flat    To think he'll get a horse like that!      'But since he has so little sense     And such a lot of cash to burn,    We'll sell him some experience     By which alone a fool can learn.    Suppose we let him have The Trap    To win Wargeilah Handicap!'      And here, I must explain to you     That, round about Wargeilah run,    There lived a very aged screw     Whose days of brilliancy were done:    A grand old warrior in his prime --    But age will beat us all in time.      A trooper's horse in seasons past     He did his share to keep the peace,    But took to falling, and at last     Was cast for age from the Police.    A publican at Conroy's Gap    Then bought and christened him The Trap.      When grass was good, and horses dear,     He changed his owner now and then    At prices ranging somewhere near     The neighbourhood of two pound ten:    And manfully he earned his keep    By yarding cows and ration sheep.      They brought him in from off the grass     And fed and groomed the old horse up;    His coat began to shine like glass --     You'd think he'd win the Melbourne Cup.    And when they'd got him fat and flash    They asked the new-chum -- fifty -- cash!      And when he said the price was high,     Their indignation knew no bounds.    They said, 'It's seldom you can buy     A horse like that for fifty pounds!    We'll refund twenty if The Trap    Should fail to win the handicap!'      The deed was done, the price was paid,     The new-chum put the horse in train:    The local sports were much afraid     That he would sad experience gain,    By racing with some shearer's hack,    Who'd beat him half-way round the track.      So, on this guileless English spark     They did most fervently impress    That he must keep the matter dark,     And not let any person guess    That he was purchasing The Trap    To win Wargeilah Handicap.      They spoke of 'spielers from The Bland',     And 'champions from the Castlereagh',    And gave the youth to understand     That all of these would stop away,    And spoil the race, if they should hear    That they had got The Trap to fear.      'Keep dark!  They'll muster thick as flies     When once the news gets sent around    We're giving such a splendid prize --     A Snowdon horse worth fifty pound!    They'll come right in from Dandaloo,    And find -- that it's a gift to you!'           .    .    .    .    .      The race came on -- with no display,     Nor any calling of the card,    But round about the pub all day     A crowd of shearers, drinking hard,    And using language in a strain    'Twere flattery to call profane.      Our hero, dressed in silk attire --     Blue jacket and a scarlet cap --    With boots that shone like flames of fire,     Now did his canter on The Trap,    And walked him up and round about,    Until the other steeds came out.      He eyed them with a haughty look,     But saw a sight that caught his breath!    It was!  Ah John!  The Chinee cook!     In boots and breeches!  Pale as death!    Tied with a rope, like any sack,    Upon a piebald pony's back!      The next, a colt -- all mud and burrs!     Half-broken, with a black boy up,    Who said, 'You gim'me pair o' spurs,     I win the bloomin' Melbourne Cup!'    These two were to oppose The Trap    For the Wargeilah Handicap!      They're off!  The colt whipped down his head,     And humped his back and gave a squeal,    And bucked into the drinking shed,     Revolving like a Cath'rine wheel!    Men ran like rats!  The atmosphere    Was filled with oaths and pints of beer!      But up the course the bold Ah John     Beside The Trap raced neck and neck:    The boys had tied him firmly on,     Which ultimately proved his wreck,    The saddle turned, and, like a clown,    He rode some distance upside down.      His legs around the horse were tied,     His feet towards the heavens were spread,    He swung and bumped at every stride     And ploughed the ground up with his head!    And when they rescued him, The Trap    Had won Wargeilah Handicap!      And no enquiries we could make     Could tell by what false statements swayed    Ah John was led to undertake     A task so foreign to his trade!    He only smiled and said, 'Hoo Ki!    I stop topside, I win all 'li!'      But never, in Wargeilah Town,     Was heard so eloquent a cheer    As when the President came down,     And toasted, in Colonial Beer,    'The finest rider on the course!    The winner of the Snowdon Horse!'      'You go and get your prize,' he said,     'He's with a wild mob, somewhere round    The mountains near The Watershed;     He's honestly worth fifty pound,    A noble horse, indeed, to win,    But none of US can run him in!

And I see it. Over to the left, very faint and far below, a pin-prick  of light.    Light in the polar wastes of a sparsely inhabited planet, and since we  are still five miles up it is a very powerful light too.    No doubt about it, as we descend farther; about fifty miles from our  objective there are men, quite a lot of them.    I think it is just then that I understand, _really_ understand, the  hazard of what we are doing. This is not an exercise. This is in dead  earnest, and if we have missed an essential factor or calculated  something wrong the result will be not a bad mark or a failed exam, or  even our personal deaths, but incalculable harm and misery to millions  of people we never even heard of.    Dead earnest. How in Space did we ever have cheek enough for this?    The lights might be the essential factor we have missed, but there is  nothing we can do about them now.    Mr. Yardo suddenly chuckles and points to the screen.    \"There you are, girlies! He's down!\"    There, grayly dim, is the map the colonel showed us; and right on the  faint line of the cliff-edge is a small brilliant dot.    The map is expanding rapidly, great lengths of coastline shooting out  of sight at the edge of the screen. Mr. Yardo has the cross-hairs  centered on the dot which is _Gilgamesh_. The dot is changing shape;  it is turning into a short ellipse, a longer one. The gyros are  leaning her out over the sea.    I look at my chronometer; 12.50 hours exactly. B looks, too, and grips  my hand.    Thirty seconds later the Andite has not blown; first fuse safety  turned off. Surely she is leaning far enough out by now?    We are hovering at five hundred feet. I can actually see the white  edge of the sea beating at the cliff. Mr. Yardo keeps making small  corrections; there is a wind out there trying to blow us away. It is  cloudy here: I can see neither moons nor stars.    Mr. Yardo checks the radio. Nothing yet.    I stare downwards and fancy I can see a metallic gleam.    Then there is a wordless shout from Mr. Yardo; a bright dot hurtles  across the screen and at the same time I see a streak of blue flame  tearing diagonally downwards a hundred feet away.    The hopper shudders to a flat concussion in the air, we are all thrown  off balance, and when I claw my way back to the screen the moving dot  is gone.    So is _Gilgamesh_.    B says numbly, \"But it wasn't a meteor. It can't have been.\"    \"It doesn't matter what it was,\" I say. \"It was some sort of missile,  I think. They must be even nearer to war than we thought.\"    We wait. What for, I don't know. Another missile, perhaps. No more  come.    At last Mr. Yardo stirs. His voice sounds creaky.    \"I guess,\" he says, then clears his throat, and tries again. \"I guess  we have to go back up.\"    B says, \"Lizzie, who was it? Do you know?\"    Of course I do. \"Do you think M'Clare was going to risk one of us on  that job? The volunteering was a fake. He went himself.\"    B whispers, \"You're just guessing.\"    \"Maybe,\" says Mr. Yardo, \"but I happened to see through that face  plate of his. It was the professor all right.\"    He has his hand on the controls when my brain starts working again. I  utter a strangled noise and dive for the hatch into the cargo hold. B  tries to grab me but I get it open and switch on the light.    Fifty-fifty chance--I've lost.    _No_, this is the one we came in and the people who put in the new  cargo did not clear out my fish-boat, they just clamped it neatly to  the wall.    I dive in and start to pass up the package. B shakes her head.    \"No, Lizzie. We can't. Don't you remember? If we got caught, it would  give everything away. Besides ... there isn't any chance--\"    \"Take a look at the screen,\" I tell her.    Sharp exclamation from Mr. Yardo. B turns to look, then takes the  package and helps me back.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Yardo maneuvers out over the sea till the thing is in the middle  of the screen; then drops to a hundred feet. It is sticking out of the  water at a fantastic angle and the waves are hardly moving it. The  nose of a ship.    \"The antigrav,\" whispers B. \"The Andite hasn't blown yet.\"    \"Ten minutes,\" says Mr. Yardo thoughtfully. He turns to me with sudden  briskness. \"What's that, Lizzie girl? A fish-boat? Good. We may need  it. Let's have a look.\"    \"It's mine,\" I tell him.    \"Now look--\"    \"Tailor made,\" I say. \"You might get into it, though I doubt it. You  couldn't work the controls.\"    It takes him fifteen seconds to realize there is no way round it; he  is six foot three and I am five foot one. Even B would find it hard.    His face goes grayish and he stares at me helplessly. Finally he nods.    \"All right, Lizzie. I guess we have to try it. Things certainly can't  be much worse than they are. We'll go over to the beach there.\"    On the beach there is wind and spray and breakers but nothing  unmanageable; the cliffs on either side keep off the worst of the  force. It is queer to feel moving air after eighteen days in a ship.  It takes six minutes to unpack and expand the boat and by that time it  is ten minutes since the missile hit and the Andite has not blown.    I crawl into the boat. In my protective clothing it is a fairly tight  fit. We agree that I will return to this same point and they will  start looking for me in fifty minutes' time and will give up if I have  not returned in two hours. I take two Andite cartridges to deal with  all eventualities and snap the nose of the boat into place. At first I  am very conscious of the two little white cigars in the pouch of my  suit, but presently I have other things to think about.    I use the \"limbs\" to crawl the last few yards of shingle into the  water and on across the sea bottom till I am beyond the line of  breakers; then I turn on the motor. I have already set the controls to  \"home\" on _Gilgamesh_ and the radar will steer me off any  obstructions. This journey in the dark is as safe as my trip around  the reefs before all this started--though it doesn't feel that way.    It takes twelve minutes to reach _Gilgamesh_, or rather the fragment  that antigrav is supporting; it is about half a mile from the beach.    The radar stops me six feet from her and I switch it off and turn to  Manual and inch closer in.    Lights, a very small close beam. The missile struck her about one  third of her length behind the nose. I know, because I can see the  whole of that length. It is hanging just above the water, sloping at  about 30 deg. to the horizontal. The ragged edge where it was torn from  the rest is just dipping into the sea.    If anyone sees this, I don't know what they will make of it but no one  could possibly think an ordinary spaceship suffered an ordinary crash,  and very little investigation would show up the truth.    I reach up with the forward set of \"limbs\" and grapple on to the  break. I now have somehow to get the hind set of \"limbs\" up without  losing my grip. I can't.    It takes several minutes to realize that I can just open the nose and  crawl out.    Immediately a wave hits me in the face and does its best to drag me  into the sea. However the interior of the ship is relatively sheltered  and presently I am inside and dragging the boat up out of reach.    I need light. Presently I manage to detach one of the two from the  boat. I turn it down to minimum close beam and hang it round my neck;  then I start up the black jag-edged tunnel of the ship.    I have to get to the nose, find the fuse, change the setting to twenty  minutes--maximum possible--and get out before it blows--out of the  water I mean. The fish-boat is not constructed to take explosions even  half a mile away. But the first thing is to find the fuse and I cannot  make out how _Gilgamesh_ is lying and therefore cannot find the door  through this bulkhead; everything is ripped and twisted. In the end I  find a gap between the bulkhead itself and the hull, and squeeze  through that.    In the next compartment things are more recognizable and I eventually  find the door. Fortunately ships are designed so that you can get  through doors even when they are in the ceiling; actually here I have  to climb up an overhang, but the surface is provided with rungs which  make it not too bad. Finally I reach the door. I shall have to use  antigrav to get down ... why didn't I just turn it on and jump? I  forgot I had it.    The door was a little way open when the missile struck; it buckled in  its grooves and is jammed fast. I can get an arm through. No more. I  switch on antigrav and hang there directing the light round the  compartment. No rents anywhere, just buckling. This compartment is  divided by a partition and the door through that is open. There will  be another door into the nose on the other side.    I bring back my feet ready to kick off on a dive through that doorway.    Behind me, something stirs.           *       *       *       *       *    My muscles go into a spasm like the one that causes a falling dream,  my hold tears loose and I go tumbling through the air, rebound from a  wall, twist, and manage to hook one foot in the frame of the door I  was aiming for. I pull myself down and turn off the antigrav; then I  just shake for a bit.    The sound was--    This is stupid, with everything torn to pieces in this ship there is  no wonder if bits shake loose and drop around--    But it was not a metallic noise, it was a kind of soft dragging, very  soft, that ended in a little thump.    Like a--    Like a loose piece of plastic dislodged from its angle of rest and  slithering down, pull yourself together Lizzie Lee.    I look through the door into the other half of this level. Shambles.  Smashed machinery every which way, blocking the door, blocking  everything. No way through at all.    Suddenly I remember the tools. Mr. Yardo loaded the fish-boat with all  it would take. I crawl back"]]]
