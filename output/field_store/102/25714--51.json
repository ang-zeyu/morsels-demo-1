Do your worst, Bram, I'll never crucify  truth to save my life. And I'll laugh at your spalacotherium when your  beetles are eating me.\"    Bram yelled and shrieked, he stamped up and down the cavern, shaking his  fists at Dodd. At last, with a final torrent of objurgation, he  disappeared.    \"A pleasant customer,\" said Tommy. \"We'll have to make that bridge, Jim,  no question about it, even if it means death in the petrol fire.\"    \"Fire's dying down fast,\" answered Dodd. \"Haidia ought to be here soon.\"    \"If Bram hasn't got her.\"    \"Bram got--that girl? If Bram harms a hair of her head I'll kill him  with worse tortures than he's ever dreamed of,\" answered Dodd, leaping  up, white with rage.    \"You mean you--?\" Tommy began.    \"Love her? Yes, I love her,\" shouted Dodd. \"She's a girl in a million.  Just the sort of helpmate I need to assist me in my work when we get  back. I tell you, Tommy, I didn't know what love meant before I saw  Haidia. I laughed at it as a romantic notion. 'Oh lyric love, half angel  and half bird!'\" he quoted, beginning to stride up and down the cavern,  while Tommy watched him in amazement.    And at this moment a complete beetle entered the cave. Complete, because  it had a plastron, or breast-shell, as well as a back-shell, or  carapace.           *       *       *       *       *    A double breast-shell! A new species of beetle? An executioner beetle,  sent by Bram to summon them to the torture? Tommy shuddered, but Dodd,  lost in his love ecstasy, was ignorant of the creature's advent.    \"'Oh lyric love--'\" he shouted again, as he twirled on his heel, to run  smack into the monster. The crack of Dodd's head against the  beetle-shell re-echoed through the cave.    The double plastron dropped, the carapace fell down: Haidia stood  revealed. The lovers, folded in each other's arms, passed momentarily  into a trance.    It was Tommy who separated them. \"We'll have to make a move,\" he said.  \"I think the fire's as low as it ever gets. Why did you bring the  shells, Haidia?\"    \"To save us all from the beetles,\" answered the girl. \"When they see us  in the shells, they will not know we are human. That is what makes it so  hard to have to be eaten by those beetles, when they are such  dumb-bells,\" she added, reproducing another of Tommy's words.    \"Come,\" she continued bravely, \"let us see if we can pass the fire.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The roaring fountain made the air a veritable inferno. Overhead the  rocks were red-hot. A cascade of sparks tumbled in a fiery shower from  the rock roof. Dodd, holding Haidia in his arms, to protect her,  staggered ahead, with Tommy in the rear. Only the beetle-shells, which  acted as non-conductors of the heat, made that fiery passage possible.    There was one moment when it seemed to Tommy as if he must let go, and  drop into that raging furnace underneath. He heard Dodd bawling hoarsely  in front of him, he nerved himself to a last effort, beating fiercely at  his blazing hair--and then the heat was past, and he had dropped  unconscious upon a bed of cool earth beside a rushing river.    He was vaguely aware of being carried in Dodd's arms, but a long time  seemed to have passed before he grew conscious again. He opened his eyes  in utter darkness. Dodd was whispering in his ear.    \"Tommy, old man, how are you feeling now?\" Dodd asked.    \"All--right,\" Tommy muttered. \"How's Haidia?\"    \"Still unconscious, poor girl. We've got to get out of here. I heard  Bram yelling in the distance. He's discovered our flight. There may be  another way out of the cave, and, if so, he'll stop at nothing to get  us. See if you can stand, but keep your head low. There's a low roof of  rock above us.\"    \"There's water,\" said Tommy, listening to the roar of a torrent that  seemed to be rushing past them.    \"It's a stream, and I believe these shells will float and bear our  weight. We've got to try. We've got to put everything to the touch now,  Tommy. I'm going to lay Haidia on one of the shells, poor girl, and  start her off. Then I'll follow, and you can bring up the rear.\"    \"I'm with you,\" said Tommy, getting upon his feet, and uttering an  exclamation of pain as, forgetful of Dodd's injunction, he let his head  strike the rock roof overhead.           *       *       *       *       *    In the darkness he felt the outlines of his beetle-shell lying beside  the torrent. He could hear Dodd in front of him, grunting as he raised  Haidia's unconscious form in his arms and deposited her in her shell.  Tommy got his own shell into the stream, and held it there as the waters  swirled around it.    \"Ready?\" he heard Dodd call.    Before he could answer, there sounded from not far away, yet strangely  muffled by the rocks, Bram's bellow of fury. Bram was evidently fully  drugged and beside himself. Inarticulate threats came floating through  the rocky chamber.    \"Bram seems to have lost his head temporarily,\" called Dodd, laughing.  \"A madman, Tommy. He insists that the marsupial lion--\"    \"Yes, I heard you telling him about it,\" answered Tommy. \"You handed it  to him straight. However, more about the marsupial lion later. I'm  ready.\"    \"Then let 'er go,\" called Dodd, and his words were swallowed up by the  sound of the hollow shell striking against the rocky bank as he launched  his strange craft into the water.    Tommy set one foot into the hollow of his shell, and let himself go.    Instantly the shell shot forward with fearful velocity. It was all Tommy  could do to balance himself, for it seemed more unstable than a canoe.  Once or twice he thought he heard Dodd shouting ahead of him, but his  cries were drowned in the rush of the torrent.           *       *       *       *       *    Suddenly a light appeared in the distance. Tommy thought it was another  of the petroleum fountains, and his heart seemed to stand still. But  then he gave a gasp of relief. It was a cluster of luminous fungi, ten  or twelve feet tall, emitting a glow equal to that of a dozen 40-watt  electric bulbs.    By that infernal light Tommy could see that the stream curved sharply.  It was about fifty feet in width, and the low rock roof had receded to  some fifteen feet overhead. Instead of a tunnel, there was nothing on  either side of them but a vast tract of marshy ground thinly coated with  the red grass.    As Tommy looked, he saw the shell that carried the unconscious body of  Haidia strike the bank beside the phosphorescent growth. He could see  the girl lying in the hollow of the shell, as pale as death, her eyes  closed. Dodd was close behind. As the swirl of the current caught his  shell, he turned to shout a warning to Tommy.    And Tommy noticed a singular thing, of which his sense of balance had  already warned him, though he had hardly given conscious thought to the  matter. _The river was running up-hill!_    Of course it was, since the center of gravity was in the shell of the  earth, and not in the center!    But, again, the shell of the earth was under their feet!    Then Tommy hit on the solution to the problem. If the river was running  up-hill, that meant that they must be near the exterior of the earth. In  other words, they had passed the center of gravity: they must be within  a mile or so of the exit from Submundia!           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy was about to shout his discovery to Dodd when his shell grounded  beside the two others, at the base of the clump of fungi.    Huge, straight, hollow stems they were, with mushroom caps, and, like  all fungi, fly-blown, for Tommy could see worms nearly a foot in length  crawling in and out of the porous stalks. The stench from the growth was  nauseating and overpowering, utterly sickening.    \"Push off and let's get out of here!\" Tommy called to Dodd, who was  balancing his shell against the bank, and trying to peer into Haidia's  face.    At that moment he caught sight of something that made his blood turn  cold!    It was an insect fully fifteen feet in height, three times that of a  beetle, lurking among the fungi. He saw a hugely elongated neck, a  three-cornered head with a pair of tentacles, and two pairs of legs as  long as a giraffe's. But what gave the added touch of horror was that  the monster, balancing itself on its hind legs, had its forelegs  extended in the attitude of one holding a prayer-book!    That attitude of devotion was so terrible that Tommy uttered a wild cry  of terror. At the same time another cry broke from Dodd's lips.    \"God, a praying mantis!\" he shouted, struggling madly to push off his  shell and Haidia's.    The next moment, as if shot from a catapult, the hideous monster  launched itself into the air straight toward them.

I'll be with you as soon as I finish getting  this weight.\"    Carnes sat on the edge of a bench and watched with admiration the long  nervous hands and the slim tapering fingers of the famous scientist.
