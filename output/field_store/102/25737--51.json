A generation that had lived through the  French Revolution and the Napoleonic era needed some one to lead them  back to moral sanity, and this was the greatest of Manzoni's works.    Like Gioberti, like D'Azeglio, like Victor Emmanuel, Manzoni was a  staunch Catholic as well as a true Italian. A close friend, Signor  Bonghi, said of him: \"He had two faiths, one in the future of  Catholicism, another in the future of Italy, and the one, whatever was  said, whatever happened, never disturbed the other. In anxious moments,  when the harmony between the two was least visible, he expected it the  most, and never allowed his faith in one or the other to be shaken. Rome  he wished to be the abode of the King; Rome he wished also to be the  abode of the Pope. Obedient to the Divine Authority of the Pontificate,  no one passed a more correct judgment upon its civil character, or  defended with more firmness, when speaking upon the subject, the right  of the State.\"    That he was the poet of resignation, as Monnier declared, is disproved  by his dramas and his novel. The martial lyrics of the plays burn with a  spirit only too evidently fired by the contemporary subjection of Italy  to Austria and France. Take for example the first and last verses of one  of the lyrics in the Adelchi, as rendered into English by Miss Ellen  Clarke:      \"From moss-covered ruin of edifice nameless,    From forests, from furnaces idle and flameless,      From furrows bedewed with the sweat of the slave,    A people dispersed doth arouse and awaken,    With senses all straining and pulses all shaken,      At a sound of strange clamor that swells like a wave.      In visages pallid, and eyes dim and shrouded,    As blinks the pale sun through a welkin beclouded,      The might of their fathers a moment is seen;    In eye and in countenance doubtfully blending;    The shame of the present seems dumbly contending      With pride in the thought of a past that hath been.             *       *       *       *       *      And deem ye, poor fools! that the need and the guerdon    That lured from afar were to lighten your burden,      Your wrongs to abolish, your fate to reverse?    Go! back to the wrecks of your palaces stately,    To the forges whose glow ye extinguished so lately,      To the field ye have tilled in the sweat of your curse!      The victor and vanquished in amity knitted,    Have doubled the yoke to your shoulders refitted;      One tyrant had quelled you, and now ye have twain:    They cast forth the lot for the serf and the cattle,    They throne on the sods that yet bleed from their battle,      And the soil and the hind are their servants again.\"    Could Manzoni have meant such words to speak other than of the Austrians  and Bourbons who were grinding Italians into servitude? Could his  marvelous meter, which has been said in its \"plunging\" to suggest a  charge of horses, have been meant other than to drive his countrymen  to self assertion? Manzoni was patriot as well as artist, and read  his times with no unskilful eye. When Victor Emmanuel visited Milan  in 1859 he said that he should like to meet the poet, and, when told  that the latter was ill, declared that he would go to him. Manzoni,  however, would not hear of this, and as soon as he was able called  upon the King. The sovereign's marks of regard and respect overwhelmed  the poet. Later he said of the meeting, \"I see in the character of the  King the intervention of Providence. He is exactly the sovereign that  circumstances require to accomplish the resurrection of Italy. He has  rectitude, courage, incorruptible honesty, and disinterestedness; he  seeks not glory or fortune for himself, but for his country. He is  so simple, never caring to appear great, that he does not meet the  admiration of those who seek to find in princes and heroes theatrical  actions and grandiloquent words. He is natural because he is true, and  this makes his enemies say that he is wanting in regal majesty. To found  Italian unity he has risked his throne, and his life.\"    Manzoni's prophecies came true and he himself had no small part in  accomplishing that great end towards which so many men of diverse forces  worked. As well as king and statesman, warrior and prophet, the man of  letters taught his people how to find their independence.          [Illustration: GIOBERTI]          GIOBERTI, THE PHILOSOPHER      Gioberti's signal gift to his countrymen was his great book, \"II Primato  d'Italia,\" a statement of the causes of Italy's early primacy among  European nations, and a philosophic theory for her regeneration. Like  Savonarola he flayed the vices of his time and preached redemption  through Christian living, but, unlike the great Fra, he undertook to  teach that the Church was no less fitted to be the seat of statecraft  than of religion. It was this that gained him the ear of Rome as well as  that of Piedmont, and made it seem for a moment as though he had found  the solution of Italy's troubles.    The effect of the \"Primato\" was felt from Turin to Naples. \"The book,\"  said Minghetti, the statesman of a later decade, \"seemed to some an  extravagance, to others a revelation. The truth is, that while many of  its ideas were peculiar to the author, and partook of his character,  his studies, and his profession, the substance of it responded to a  sentiment still undefined, but which had been slowly developing in the  minds of Italians. The idea of nationality had, in the previous years,  spread far and wide through many channels, open and secret, and the  desire of a great and free country had taken possession of the majority  of the younger men; but the methods hitherto employed had proved so  inefficient that weariness and disgust had followed. Experience had  proved that conspiracies, secret societies, and partial insurrections  were of no utility--that they made the governments more severe, retarded  civil progress, arrested the increase of public prosperity, plunged many  families into misery, and did not even win the approbation of civilized  nations.    \"The rumors of wars and of European insurrections which were circulated  every spring time, the mystic declamations of Mazzini in the name of  God and the people, ... all these things showed that the time had come  to try another method, more serious, more practical, and surer....  Gioberti, a Piedmontese exile for the sake of liberty, had taken part  in the earliest phases of the \"Giovine Italia\" or had been in relation  with its chiefs, but had wearied of that pompous and impotent society.  His intellect had anticipated that change which had been imperceptibly  operating and now began to appear widely ... but obscurely in the  consciousness of many men. This opportuneness and coincidence of  the ideas of the author with the spirit of the day gave his book  a special importance.... The purpose of the book was to prove that  Italy, although it had lost all political value for the outside world,  contained all the conditions of moral and political revival, and that  to effect this change there was no need of revolutions, invasions, or  imitations of the foreigner, since political revival is limited to three  heads--unity, independence, and liberty--the first two of which might be  obtained by a confederation of the various states under the presidency  of the Pope, and the last by means of internal reforms in each state,  effected by their respective Princes without danger or diminution of  their real power.\"    Vincenzo Gioberti was born in Turin April 5, 1801, and was the only  child of parents of very moderate means. At an early age it was decided  that he should prepare for the priesthood, and his education was  entrusted to the fathers of the Oratory in Turin. His nature was more  conformable to the teaching of churchmen than was that of Alfieri or  Manzoni, and whereas both the latter had chafed under the discipline  and mental training of the Church schools the young Gioberti became a  thoughtful student. He differed from Mazzini, a contemporary studying  at Genoa, in that although he early learned that the condition of his  country was wretched, his mind could only conceive of improvement by  orderly and temperate steps. He was a brilliant scholar, and during the  years of his training for the priesthood he delved deep into the history  of philosophy, and studied closely the writings of the fathers and  doctors of the Roman Church. In 1825 he was ordained a priest.    The young priest, a man of a serious and reflective mind, turned his  attention to the affairs of his country, and gradually entered upon a  careful study of the literature of the day, and the political theories  that were then agitating men's minds. He took part in scholastic  discussions of religious and political subjects, and in time widened his  acquaintance in Turin so that he came in contact with the leaders of  thought in the Sardinian capital. As he met men and spoke his thoughts  more freely it came to be seen that he was occupied above everything  else with the problem of freeing Italy from the foreign overlords, and  this gradually marked him as a free-thinking priest. At first, however,  he did not incur the enmity of the clerical party, for, although his  conception of Italian freedom consisted in emancipation not alone from  the arms of foreign masters, but from all modes of thought which were  alien to the nation's genius, and detrimental to its national authority,  this authority was always associated in his mind with the idea of Papal  supremacy, but a supremacy intellectual rather than political.    The reign of Charles Albert of Piedmont was a continual battle between  the conservative party and the enlightened liberals. The leaders of the  conservatives were clerics, in large measure Jesuits, who kept in close  touch with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T.

At last  Cape Horn and its swelling seas were left behind, and we reached  Valparaiso in about sixty days from Rio.  We anchored in the open  roadstead, and spent there about ten days, visiting all the usual  places of interest, its foretop, main-top, mizzen-top, etc.  Halleck and Ord went up to Santiago, the capital of Chili, some  sixty miles inland, but I did not go.  Valparaiso did not impress  me favorably at all.  Seen from the sea, it looked like a long  string of houses along the narrow beach, surmounted with red banks  of earth, with little verdure, and no trees at all.  Northward the  space widened out somewhat, and gave room for a plaza, but the mass  of houses in that quarter were poor.  We were there in November,  corresponding to our early spring, and we enjoyed the large  strawberries which abounded.  The Independence frigate, Commodore  Shubrick, came in while we were there, having overtaken us, bound  also for California.  We met there also the sloop-of-war levant,  from California, and from the officers heard of many of the events  that had transpired about the time the navy, under Commodore Sloat,  had taken possession of the country.    All the necessary supplies being renewed in Valparaiso, the voyage  was resumed.  For nearly forty days we had uninterrupted favorable  winds, being in the \"trades,\" and, having settled down to sailor  habits, time passed without notice.  We had brought with us all the  books we could find in New York about California, and had read them  over and over again: Wilkes's \"Exploring Expedition;\" Dana's \"Two  Years before the Mast;\" and Forbes's \"Account of the Missions.\"  It  was generally understood we were bound for Monterey, then the  capital of Upper California.  We knew, of course, that General  Kearney was enroute for the same country overland; that Fremont was  therewith his exploring party; that the navy had already taken  possession, and that a regiment of volunteers, Stevenson's, was  to follow us from New York; but nevertheless we were impatient to  reach our destination.  About the middle of January the ship began  to approach the California coast, of which the captain was duly  cautious, because the English and Spanish charts differed some  fifteen miles in the longitude, and on all the charts a current of  two miles an hour was indicated northward along the coast.  At last  land was made one morning, and here occurred one of those accidents  so provoking after a long and tedious voyage.  Macomb, the master  and regular navigator, had made the correct observations, but  Nicholson during the night, by an observation on the north star,  put the ship some twenty miles farther south than was the case by  the regular reckoning, so that Captain Bailey gave directions to  alter the course of the ship more to the north, and to follow the  coast up, and to keep a good lookout for Point Pinos that marks the  location of Monterey Bay.  The usual north wind slackened, so that  when noon allowed Macomb to get a good observation, it was found  that we were north of Ano Nuevo, the northern headland of Monterey  Bay.  The ship was put about, but little by little arose one of  those southeast storms so common on the coast in winter, and we  buffeted about for several days, cursing that unfortunate  observation on the north star, for, on first sighting the coast,  had we turned for Monterey, instead of away to the north, we would  have been snugly anchored before the storm.  But the southeaster  abated, and the usual northwest wind came out again, and we sailed  steadily down into the roadstead of Monterey Bay.  This is shaped  somewhat like a fish hook, the barb being the harbor, the point  being Point Pinos, the southern headland.  Slowly the land came out  of the water, the high mountains about Santa Cruz, the low beach of  the Saunas, and the strongly-marked ridge terminating in the sea in  a point of dark pine-trees.  Then the line of whitewashed houses of  adobe, backed by the groves of dark oaks, resembling old  apple-trees; and then we saw two vessels anchored close to the  town.  One was a small merchant-brig and another a large ship  apparently dismasted.  At last we saw a boat coming out to meet us,  and when it came alongside, we were surprised to find Lieutenant  Henry Wise, master of the Independence frigate, that we had left at  Valparaiso.  Wise had come off to pilot us to our anchorage.  While  giving orders to the man at the wheel, he, in his peculiar fluent  style, told to us, gathered about him, that the Independence had  sailed from Valparaiso a week after us and had been in Monterey a  week; that the Californians had broken out into an insurrection;  that the naval fleet under Commodore Stockton was all down the  coast about San Diego; that General Kearney had reached the  country, but had had a severe battle at San Pascual, and had been  worsted, losing several officers and men, himself and others  wounded; that war was then going on at Los Angeles; that the whole  country was full of guerrillas, and that recently at Yerba Buena  the alcalde, Lieutenant Bartlett, United States Navy, while out  after cattle, had been lassoed, etc., etc.  Indeed, in the short  space of time that Wise was piloting our ship in, he told us more  news than we could have learned on shore in a week, and, being  unfamiliar with the great distances, we imagined that we should  have to debark and begin fighting at once.  Swords were brought  out, guns oiled and made ready, and every thing was in a bustle  when the old Lexington dropped her anchor on January 26, 1847, in  Monterey Bay, after a voyage of one hundred and ninety-eight days  from New York.  Every thing on shore looked bright and beautiful,  the hills covered with grass and flowers, the live-oaks so serene  and homelike, and the low adobe houses, with red-tiled roofs and  whitened walls, contrasted well with the dark pine-trees behind,  making a decidedly good impression upon us who had come so far to  spy out the land.  Nothing could be more peaceful in its looks than  Monterey in January, 1847.  We had already made the acquaintance of  Commodore Shubrick and the officers of the Independence in  Valparaiso, so that we again met as old friends.  Immediate  preparations were made for landing, and, as I was quartermaster and  commissary, I had plenty to do.  There was a small wharf and an  adobe custom-house in possession of the navy; also a barrack of two  stories, occupied by some marines, commanded by Lieutenant Maddox;  and on a hill to the west of the town had been built a two-story  block-house of hewed logs occupied by a guard of sailors under  command of Lieutenant Baldwin, United States Navy.  Not a single  modern wagon or cart was to be had in Monterey, nothing but the old  Mexican cart with wooden wheels, drawn by two or three pairs of  oxen, yoked by the horns.  A man named Tom Cole had two or more of  these, and he came into immediate requisition.  The United States  consul, and most prominent man there at the time, was Thomas O.  Larkin, who had a store and a pretty good two-story house occupied  by his family.  It was soon determined that our company was to land  and encamp on the hill at the block-house, and we were also to have  possession of the warehouse, or custom-house, for storage.  The  company was landed on the wharf, and we all marched in full dress  with knapsacks and arms, to the hill and relieved the guard under  Lieutenant Baldwin.  Tents and camp-equipage were hauled up, and  soon the camp was established.  I remained in a room at the  customhouse, where I could superintend the landing of the stores  and their proper distribution.  I had brought out from New York  twenty thousand dollars commissary funds, and eight thousand  dollars quartermaster funds, and as the ship contained about six  months' supply of provisions, also a saw-mill, grist-mill, and  almost every thing needed, we were soon established comfortably.  We found the people of Monterey a mixed set of Americans, native  Mexicans, and Indians, about one thousand all told.  They were kind  and pleasant, and seemed to have nothing to do, except such as  owned ranches in the country for the rearing of horses and cattle.  Horses could be bought at any price from four dollars up to  sixteen, but no horse was ever valued above a doubloon or Mexican  ounce (sixteen dollars).  Cattle cost eight dollars fifty cents for  the best, and this made beef net about two cents a pound, but at  that time nobody bought beef by the pound, but by the carcass.    Game of all kinds--elk, deer, wild geese, and ducks--was abundant;  but coffee, sugar, and small stores, were rare and costly.    There were some half-dozen shops or stores, but their shelves were  empty.  The people were very fond of riding, dancing, and of shows  of any kind.  The young fellows took great delight in showing off  their horsemanship, and would dash along, picking up a half-dollar  from the ground, stop their horses in full career and turn about on  the space of a bullock's hide, and their skill with the lasso was  certainly wonderful.  At full speed they could cast their lasso  about the horns of a bull, or so throw it as to catch any  particular foot.  These fellows would work all day on horseback in  driving cattle or catching wildhorses for a mere nothing, but all  the money offered would not have hired one of them to walk a mile.  The girls were very fond of dancing, and they did dance gracefully  and well.  Every Sunday, regularly, we had a baile, or dance, and  sometimes interspersed through the week.    I remember very well, soon after our arrival, that we were all  invited to witness a play called \"Adam and Eve.\"   Eve was  personated by a pretty young girl known as Dolores Gomez, who,  however, was dressed very unlike Eve, for she was covered with "]]]
