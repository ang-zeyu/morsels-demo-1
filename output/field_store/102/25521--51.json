I am not an emigration-tout, and have no interest in painting my picture  in too vivid colours, and in these remarks I have transgressed against  some of the ordinary colonial views on the subject; but I have done so  with intention, because I consider them not entirely in the right. The  colonist says--we don't want gentlemen here, we want MEN! But he forgets  that the unfortunate individual he disparages has often more real  manhood at bottom than the class below him. Therefore, the middle-class  emigrant must remember the qualities most required in him--pluck,  energy, and resolution.    I have met many middle-class men in the colony, and all contrived to  bear out the view I have put forward by their own condition. Those who  come to grief do so from their own failings and deficiencies. Some growl  and grumble a little now and then, and think they would rather be back  in England; but, when they reflect upon the condition they would  probably be occupying at home in the ordinary course of things, they are  forced to admit that they are better off. At any rate, such bitter and  terrible distress as overtook so many thousands in Britain a year or two  ago, could scarcely fall to the lot of the same people under any  circumstances, if they were industrious colonists. But I have digressed  inordinately, and must get back to Auckland forthwith.    The barracks are empty at last, and all our fellow-voyagers have found  each his or her starting-point in the new life. Our own little party of  cuddy-passengers is dispersed as well. Some have gone off to join  friends in the country, some are gone on to distant parts of the colony,  some have gone this way or that, scattering to work in all directions;  only a couple of us are left, and it is time that we should begin to  follow the plan we have conceived for ourselves.    Parting with shipmates, with the faces that have been so long familiar  to us, seems to have severed the last link that bound us to the old  country, the old home, and the old ways. We shall meet with many of them  again, no doubt, but then the old \"Englishness\" will have disappeared,  and we shall be at one with those who now are strangers to us, we too  shall be New Zealanders. Henceforth all before us and around us is  strange and new, an untried, unknown world. We are about to enter on a  life totally different to that we have hitherto led, and it is a life  that we have got to make ours for the time to come; for there is no  thought in our minds of retreat, even if we find the unknown more  distasteful than we think. But, courage! \"Hope points before to guide us  on our way,\" and, as yet, there is nothing in the prospect but what is  bright and inspiriting, surely; nothing to diminish our youthful energy,  nothing to daunt our British pluck! The past lies behind us, with its  sweet and tender recollections, and with a softened sense of  remembrance of those failures and sadnesses and bitternesses that are  linked with them. Now our cry must be \"Forward!\" for a page in the book  of our lives is completely turned down, and we may imagine there is  endorsed upon it, \"Sacred to the memory of auld lang syne!\"    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: 1882. The railway now runs northward to Helensville,  connecting Auckland with the Kaipara; and is being pushed on to  Whangarei. To the south, it penetrates far into the Waikato country, and  it is only a question of a few years before Auckland, New Plymouth,  Wellington, and Napier will be joined by rail.]    [Footnote 2: 1882. During the last year or two, there has been some  depression in New Zealand, and, for the first time in her history, many  labourers have had difficulty in getting work. But that crisis is now  past, and things are rapidly returning--as they were bound to do--to  former conditions, such as I have described.]          CHAPTER III.    GOING UP COUNTRY.      I and my last remaining shipmate certainly came out here without any  very clear idea of what we were going to do. We came to make our  fortunes, of course, after the manner of all new-chums, but as to how we  were to set about it, and what were to be the first steps we should  take, we had the very vaguest notion.    However, our condition of existence as new-chums sat very lightly upon  us. Hope! We were all hope; we were hope incarnate! We felt that we were  bound to win. It seemed, though, that the beginning must be made in some  fashion that was, to say the least of it, unpleasant, now that we were  face to face with the reality. Plenty of work offered, but none of it  seemed to be of a particularly engaging kind; and, moreover, the wage  offered us was extremely paltry, so we considered. For we belonged to  that much maligned middle-class, which, in the chrysalis or new-chum  stage, is so greatly contemned by colonists.    But it happened that, long long ago, a certain schoolfellow of ours had  gone forth into the colonial world. He was in the sixth form when we  were in the first, or thereabouts; but, as his family and ours were  neighbours in the old home, there had been enough intimacy between us.  It was owing to his letters home that we had determined on emigration.  He had been apprised of our coming, so now we were not surprised to  receive a message from him through a resident in Auckland. This was an  invitation to join him at a distant settlement called Te Pahi, there to  make a beginning at pioneer farm work, and see what might turn up.    We found on inquiry that little or nothing was known in Auckland of Te  Pahi. It was a new township in the Kaipara district, lying sixty or  eighty miles north of Auckland. That was about the sum of what we could  learn of our destination, except that there were very few settlers in  the Kaipara, and that communication between it and Auckland was not very  good. Somewhat later than this date--in fact, to be precise, in 1875--an  Auckland newspaper wrote of the Kaipara under the title of Terra  Incognita. So that when we decided on going there, we felt that we were  about to penetrate an almost unexplored country. But we found out what  were the means of transit, and prepared to set out without further  delay.    Now that we were on the point of starting into the bush, and entering  into the realities of our new life, we began to encounter the  difficulties of our situation. The first that met us would be more  annoying were it not for the ludicrousness of it. It was the baggage  difficulty, a thing that took us quite by surprise; for, till then, we  had never appreciated the word \"transport\" at its full meaning. Like  most home-living Britons, hitherto surrounded by every facility for  locomotion of persons and goods, we had utterly failed to understand  that in a new country things are wholly different in this respect. One  can get about one's self easily enough; travel can always be  accomplished somehow, even if one has to walk; but it is quite another  thing to move baggage. In a roadless country, where labour is scarce and  dear, the conveyance of goods from place to place is a difficult matter.  It can be done, of course, but the cost of it is frightful.    Our old schoolfellow, who, by the way, will be known under the  appellation of \"Old Colonial\" in these pages, had apparently had some  experience of new-chums before. His agent in Auckland had been  instructed to see to us, and one of that person's first inquiries was  regarding our impedimenta.    We had been out-fitted in London by the world-renowned firm of Argent  and Joy. There being no experience to guide us, we had placed ourselves  unreservedly in the hands of the firm, and had been provided by them  with a sumptuous stock of what they were pleased to term necessaries.  Altogether, these formed a goodly pile. Our bedroom at the hotel was  cram full of boxes, trunks, and portmanteaus; and their contents were  now spread out for the inspection of our adviser.    \"Good gracious!\" was his exclamation when he surveyed our property, and  then he mused awhile.    \"Look here!\" he said suddenly. \"I've got some distressing intelligence  to break to you. Prepare your minds for a shock. This inheritance is a  _dead horse_. Chuck it overboard at once!\" And he waved his hand  impressively over our belongings.    We did not understand; we thought this was some new kind of joke--which  it was, but not to us. We asked for explanations; all that we wanted was  to know how we were to get these things up to the Kaipara. Our colonial  friend sighed deeply, and proceeded mournfully to expound the position.  He told us that we could not afford to possess more personals than were  absolutely necessary, and these ought to pack into one box of easily  portable size. In the first place, the freight of our baggage into the  bush would cost us something approaching to the expense of our passage  out from England. In the second place, we were not going to a house of  our own, but were going to work on different farms, and might be moving  about a good deal. We could not carry such a cargo about with us, for  the cost of doing so would be simply ruinous. It appeared, too, that we  could not even keep the things until we _had_ got a house of our own to  store them in. For, our only resource, with that in view, would be to  warehouse them in Auckland, and the expense of even this dead weight  would make too large a hole in our possible earnings. Finally, there was  hardly anything in our entire outfit that would be of much practical use  to us.    Aghast and grieving, we comprehended at last that we should have to rid  ourselves of the too heavy burden with which Messrs. Argent and  Joy had weighted us, in consideration of that prodigious and  ever-to-be-regretted cheque. There was no help for it. An Israelitish  dealer, who happily abided in the city, would have to be called in. And  it could scarcely be said that he bought our property of us; it was a  nearer approach to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29084"],[0,"The Cook and Housekeeper's Complete and Universal Dictionary; Including a System (#9)"],[1,"STILLA. Bake codlins, or any other sour apples, but without  burning them; pulp them through a sieve into a bowl, and beat them for  four hours. Sweeten the fruit with honey, and beat it four hours more;  the longer it is beaten the better. Pour a thin layer of the mixture on  a cloth spread over a tray, and bake it in a slow oven, with bits of  wood placed under the tray. If not baked enough on one side, set it  again in the oven; and when quite done, turn it. Pour on it a fresh  layer of the mixture, and proceed with it in like manner, till the whole  is properly baked. Apple postilla is also made by peeling the apples and  taking out the cores after they are baked, sweetening with sugar, and  beating it up with a wooden spoon till it is all of a froth. Then put it  on two trays, and bake it for two hours in an oven moderately hot. After  this another layer of the beaten apples is added, and pounded loaf sugar  spread over. Sometimes a still finer sort is made, by beating yolks of  eggs to a froth, and then mixing it with the apple juice.      APPLE PUDDING. Butter a baking dish, put in the batter, and the apples  whole, without being cut or pared, and bake in a quick oven. If the  apples be pared, they will mix with the batter while in the oven, and  make the pudding soft. Serve it up with sugar and butter. For a superior  pudding, grate a pound of pared apples, work it up with six ounces of  butter, four eggs, grated lemon peel, a little sugar and brandy. Line  the dish with good paste, strew over it bits of candied peel, put in the  pudding, and bake it half an hour. A little lemon juice may be added, a  spoonful of bread crumbs, or two or three Naples biscuits. Another way  is, to pare and quarter four large apples, boil them tender, with the  rind of a lemon, in so little water that it may be exhausted in the  boiling. Beat the apples fine in a mortar, add the crumb of a small  roll, four ounces of melted butter, the yolks of five and the whites of  three eggs, the juice of half a lemon, and sugar to taste. Beat all  together, and lay it in a dish with paste to turn out, after baking.      APPLE PUFFS. Pare the fruit, and either stew them in a stone jar on a  hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, mix the pulp of the apple with  sugar and lemon peel shred fine, taking as little as possible of the  apple juice. Bake them in thin paste, in a quick oven: if small, a  quarter of an hour will be sufficient. Orange or quince marmalade is a  great improvement; cinnamon pounded, or orange flower-water, will make  an agreeable change.      APPLE SAUCE. Pare, core, and slice some apples; put them in a stone jar,  into a saucepan of water, or on a hot hearth. If the latter, put in a  spoonful or two of water, to prevent burning. When done, mash them up,  put in a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, and a little brown sugar.  Serve it in a sauce tureen, for goose and roast pork.      APPLE TRIFLE. Scald some apples, pass them through a sieve, and make a  layer of the pulp at the bottom of a dish; mix the rind of half a lemon  grated, and sweeten with sugar. Or mix half a pint of milk, half a pint  of cream, and the yolk of an egg. Scald it over the fire, and stir it  all the time without boiling; lay it over the apple pulp with a spoon,  and put on it a whip prepared the day before.      APPLE WATER. Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling  water on them, or on roasted apples. Strain it well, and sweeten it  lightly. When cold, it is an agreeable drink in a fever.      APPLE WINE. To every gallon of apple juice, immediately as it comes from  the press, add two pounds of lump sugar; boil it as long as any scum  rises, then strain it through a sieve, and let it cool. Add some yeast,  and stir it well; let it work in the tub for two or three weeks, or till  the head begins to flatten; then skim off the head, draw off the liquor  clear, and tun it. When made a year, rack it off, and fine it with  isinglass. To every eight gallons add half a pint of the best rectified  spirits of wine, or a pint of brandy.      APRICOTS DRIED. Pare thin and halve four pounds of apricots, put them in  a dish, and strew among them three pounds of fine loaf-sugar powdered.  When the sugar melts, set the fruit over a stove to do very gently; as  each piece becomes tender, take it out, and put it into a china bowl.  When all are done, and the boiling heat a little abated, pour the syrup  over them. In a day or two remove the syrup, leaving only a little in  each half. In a day or two more turn them, and so continue daily till  quite dry, in the sun or in a warm place. Keep the apricots in boxes,  with layers of fine paper.      APRICOTS PRESERVED. There are various ways of doing this: one is by  steeping them in brandy. Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready  a quarter of the weight of loaf sugar in fine powder. Put the fruit into  an ice-pot that shuts very close, throw the sugar over it, and then  cover the fruit with brandy. Between the top and cover of the pot, fit  in a piece of thick writing paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water,  and heat it without boiling, till the brandy be as hot as you can bear  your finger in it. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy on it.  When cold, put a bladder over, and tie it down tight.--Apricots may also  be preserved in jelly. Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it; weigh an  equal quantity of sugar in fine powder, and strew over it. Next day boil  very gently till they are clear, remove them into a bowl, and pour in  the liquor. The following day, mix it with a quart of codlin liquor,  made by boiling and straining, and a pound of fine sugar. Let it boil  quickly till it comes to a jelly; put the fruit into it, give it one  boil, skim it well, and distribute into small pots.--A beautiful  preserve may also be made in the following manner. Having selected the  finest ripe apricots, pare them as thin as possible, and weigh them. Lay  them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards. Prepare an equal  weight of loaf sugar finely pounded, and strew it over them; in the mean  time break the stones, and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain  twelve hours, put it into a preserving pan, with the sugar and juice,  and also the kernels. Let it simmer very gently till it becomes clear;  then take out the pieces of apricot singly as they are done, put them  into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels over them. The scum must  be taken off as it rises, and the pots covered with brandy paper.--Green  apricots are preserved in a different way. Lay vine or apricot leaves at  the bottom of the pan, then fruit and leaves alternately till full, the  upper layer being thick with leaves. Then fill the pan with spring  water, and cover it down, that no steam may escape. Set the pan at a  distance from the fire, that in four or five hours the fruit may be  soft, but not cracked. Make a thin syrup of some of the water, and drain  the fruit. When both are cold, put the fruit into the pan, and the syrup  to it; keep the pan at a proper distance from the fire till the  apricots green, but on no account boil or crack them. Remove the fruit  very carefully into a pan with the syrup for two or three days, then  pour off as much of it as will be necessary, boil with more sugar to  make a rich syrup, and add a little sliced ginger to it. When cold, and  the thin syrup has all been drained from the fruit, pour the thick over  it. The former will serve to sweeten pies.      APRICOT CHEESE. Weigh an equal quantity of pared fruit and sugar, wet  the latter a very little, and let it boil quickly, or the colour will be  spoiled. Blanch the kernels and add them to it: twenty or thirty minutes  will boil it. Put it in small pots or cups half filled.      APRICOT JAM. When the fruit is nearly ripe, pare and cut some in halves;  break the stones, blanch the kernels, and put them to the fruit. Boil  the parings in a little water, and strain it: to a pound of fruit add  three quarters of a pound of fine sifted sugar, and a glass of the water  in which the parings were boiled. Stir it over a brisk fire till it  becomes rather stiff: when cold, put apple jelly over the jam, and tie  it down with brandy paper.      APRICOT PUDDING. Halve twelve large apricots, and scald them till they  are soft. Meanwhile pour on the grated crumbs of a penny loaf a pint of  boiling cream; when half cold, add four ounces of sugar, the yolks of  four beaten eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pound the apricots in a  mortar, with some or all of the kernels; then mix the fruit and other  ingredients together, put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding in  half an hour.      AROMATIC VINEGAR. Mix with common vinegar a quantity of powdered chalk  or whiting, sufficient to destroy the acidity; and when the white  sediment is formed, pour off the insipid liquor. The powder is then to  be dried, and some oil of vitriol poured upon it, as long as white acid  fumes continue to ascend. This substance forms the essential ingredient,  the fumes of which are particularly useful in purifying rooms and places  where any contagion is suspected.      ARROW ROOT. This valuable article has often been counterfeited: the  American is the best, and may generally be known by its colour and  solidity. If genuine, the arrow root is very nourishing, especially for  weak bowels. Put into a saucepan half a pint of water, a glass of  sherry, or a spoonful of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar. Boil it  up once, then mix it by degrees into a dessert-spoonful of arrow root,  previously rubbed smooth with two spoonfuls of cold water. Return the  whole into the saucepan, stir and boil it three minutes.      ARSENIC. The fatal effects of mineral poisons are too often experienced,  and for want of timely assistance but seldom counteracted.
