He paid also special attention to two  bright white spots upon the planet, and he showed that these formed round  the planet's poles and increased in size as the winter of each several  hemisphere drew on and diminished again with the advance of summer,  behaving therefore as do the snow caps of our own polar regions.    The next stage in the development of our knowledge of Mars must be  ascribed to the two German astronomers, Beer and Maedler, who made a series  of drawings in the years 1830, 1832 and 1837, by means of a telescope of 4  inches aperture, from which they were able to construct a chart of the  entire globe. This chart may be considered classic, for the features which  it represents have been observed afresh at each succeeding opposition.  Mars, therefore, possesses a permanent topography, and some of the  markings in question can be identified, not only in the rough sketches  made by Sir William Herschel, but even in those made by Hooke and Cassini  as far back as the year 1666. In the forty years that followed, the planet  was studied by many of the most skilled observers, particularly by Mr. J.  N. Lockyer in 1862, and the Rev. W. R. Dawes in 1864. In 1877, the late  Mr. N. E. Green, drawing-master to Queen Victoria, and a distinguished  painter in water colours, made a series of sketches of the planet from a  station in the island of Madeira 2000 feet above sea-level. When the  opposition was over, Mr. Green collected together a large number of  drawings, and formed a chart of the planet, much richer in detail than any  that had preceded it, and from his skill, experience and training as an  artist he reproduced the appearance of the planet with a fidelity that had  never been equalled before and has never been surpassed since. At this  time it was generally assumed that Mars was a miniature of our own world.  The brighter districts of its surface were supposed to be continents, the  darker, seas. As Sir William Herschel had already pointed out long before,  the little world evidently had its seasons, its axis being inclined to the  plane of its orbit at much the same angle as is the case with the Earth;  it had its polar caps, presumably of ice and snow; its day was but very  little longer than that of the Earth; and the only important difference  seemed to be that it had a longer year, and was a little further off the  Sun. But the general conclusion was that it was so like the Earth in its  conditions that we had practically found out all that there was to know;  all that seemed to be reserved for future research was that a few minor  details of the surface might be filled in as the power of our telescopes  was increased.    But fortunately for progress, this sense of satisfaction was to be rudely  disturbed. As Mars, in its progress round the Sun, receded from the Earth,  or rather as the Earth moved away from it, the astronomers who observed so  diligently during the autumn of 1877 turned their attention to other  objects. One of them, however, Schiaparelli, the most distinguished  astronomer on the continent of Europe, still continued to watch the  planet, and, as the result of his labours, he published some months later  the first of a magnificent series of _Memoirs_, bringing to light what  appeared to be a new feature. His drawings not only showed the \"lands\" and  \"seas,\" that is to say the bright and dark areas, that Green and his  predecessors had drawn, but also a number of fine, narrow, dark lines  crossing the \"lands\" in every direction. These narrow lines are the  markings which have since been so celebrated as the \"canals of Mars,\" and  the discussion as to the real nature of these canals has focussed  attention upon Mars in a way that, perhaps, nothing else could have done.  Before 1877 the study of planetary markings was left almost entirely to  the desultory labours of amateurs, skilled though many of them were; since  1877, the most powerful telescopes of the great public observatories of  the world have been turned upon Mars, and the most skilful and experienced  of professional astronomers have not been ashamed to devote their time to  it.    There is no need to pass in review the whole of the immense mass of  observations that have been accumulated since Schiaparelli brought out the  first of his great Memoirs. That Memoir gave rise to an immediate  controversy, for many astronomers of skill and experience had observed the  planet in 1877 without detecting the network of lines which Schiaparelli  had revealed, and it was natural that they should feel some reluctance in  accepting results so strange and novel. But little by little this  controversy has passed. We now know that the \"canals\" vary much in their  visibility, and \"curiously enough the canals are most conspicuous, not at  the time the planet is nearest to the Earth and its general features are  in consequence best seen, but as the planet goes away the canals come out.  The fact is that the orbital position and the seasonal epoch conspire to a  masking of the phenomena.\" This was the chief reason why Schiaparelli's  discoveries seemed at first to stand so entirely without corroboration;  the \"canals\" did not become conspicuous until after most observers had  desisted from following the planet. Another reason was that, in 1877, Mars  was low down in the sky for northern observatories, and good definition is  an essential for their recognition. But the careful examination of  drawings made in earlier oppositions, especially those made by Dawes and  Green, afforded confirmation of not a few of Schiaparelli's \"canals\"; even  in 1877 a few of the easiest and most conspicuous had been delineated by  other astronomers before any rumour of Schiaparelli's work had come  abroad, and as Mars came under observation again and again at successive  oppositions, the number of those who were able to verify Schiaparelli's  discoveries increased. It has now long been known that the great Italian  astronomer was not the victim of a mere optical illusion; there were  actual markings on the planet Mars where he had represented them; markings  which, when seen under like conditions and with equal instrumental  equipment, did present the appearance of straight, narrow lines. The  \"canals of Mars\" are not mere figments of the imagination, but have a real  objective basis.    As this controversy has passed away, another and a very different one has  arisen out of an unfortunate mistranslation of the term chosen by  Schiaparelli to indicate these linear streaks. In conformity with the type  of nomenclature adopted by previous areographers who had divided Mars into  \"seas,\" \"continents,\" \"islands,\" \"isthmuses,\" \"straits\" and the like,  Schiaparelli had called the narrow lines he detected \"_canali_\", that is  to say \"channels,\" but without intending to convey the idea of artificial  construction. Indeed, he himself was careful to point out that these  designations \"were not intended to prejudge the nature of the spot, and  were nothing but an artifice for helping the memory and for shortening  descriptions.\" And he added, \"We speak in the same way of the lunar seas,  although we well know that there are no true seas on the Moon.\" But  \"_canali_\" was unhappily rendered in English as \"canals,\" instead of  \"channels.\" \"Channel\" would have left the nature of the marking an open  question, but, in English, \"canal\" means an artificial waterway. Here then  the question as to whether or no Mars is inhabited comes definitely before  us. Have we sufficient grounds for believing that the \"canals\" are  artificial constructions, or may they be merely natural formations?    In 1894, Mr. Percival Lowell founded at Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A., a  well-equipped observatory for the special study of Mars, and he has  continued his scrutiny of the planet from that time to the present with  the most unrelaxing perseverance. The chief results that he has obtained  have been the detection of many new \"canals\"; the discovery of a number of  dark, round dots, termed by him \"oases,\" at the junctions of the \"canals\";  and the demonstration that the \"canals\" and certain of the dusky regions  are subject to strictly seasonal change, as really as the polar caps  themselves. In addition, he has formed the conclusion, which he has  supported with much ingenuity and skill, that the regularity of the  \"canals\" and \"oases\" quite precludes the possibility of their being  natural formations. Hence there has arisen the second controversy: that on  the nature of the \"canals\"; for Mr. Lowell considers that their presence  proves the existence of inhabitants on Mars, who, by means of a Titanic  system of irrigation, are fighting a losing battle against the gradual  desiccation of their planet.    In a paper published in the _International Scientific Review_, \"Scientia,\"  in January, 1910, Mr. Lowell gave a summary of his argument.        \"Organic life needs water for its existence. This water we see exists      on Mars, but in very scant amount, so that if life of any sort exists      there, it must be chiefly dependent on the semi-annual unlocking of      the polar snows for its supply, inasmuch as there are no surface      bodies of it over the rest of the planet. Now the last few years,      beginning with Schiaparelli in 1877, and much extended since at      Flagstaff, have shown:        \"The surface of the planet to be very curiously meshed by a fine      network of lines and spots.        \"Now if one considers first the appearance of this network of lines      and spots, and then its regular behaviour, he will note that its      geometrism precludes its causation on such a scale by any natural      process and, on the other hand, that such is precisely the aspect      which an artificial irrigating system, dependent upon the melting of      the polar snows, would assume.

In short,  let it be what it will, so it comes quickly; for the weight of armour  and the fatigue of travel are not to be supported without recruiting  food.\" Thereupon they laid the cloth at the inn-door for the benefit  of the fresh air, and the landlord brought him a piece of the salt  fish, but ill-watered and as ill-dressed; and as for the bread, it was  as mouldy and brown as the knight's armour.    While he was at supper, a pig-driver happened to sound his  cane-trumpet, or whistle of reeds, four or five times as he came near  the inn, which made Don Quixote the more positive that he was in a  famous castle, where he was entertained with music at supper, that  the country girls were great ladies, and the innkeeper the governor of  the castle, which made him applaud himself for his resolution, and his  setting out on such an account. The only thing that vexed him was,  that he was not yet dubbed a knight; for he fancied he could not  lawfully undertake any adventure till he had received the order of  knighthood.          CHAPTER III.    _An account of the pleasant method taken by Don Quixote to be dubbed a  knight._      Don Quixote's mind being disturbed with that thought, he abridged even  his short supper; and as soon as he had done, he called his host, then  shut him and himself up in the stable, and falling at his feet, \"I  will never rise from this place,\" cried he, \"most valorous knight,  till you have graciously vouchsafed to grant me a boon, which I will  now beg of you, and which will redound to your honour and the good of  mankind.\" The innkeeper, strangely at a loss to find his guest at his  feet, and talking at this rate, endeavoured to make him rise; but all  in vain, till he had promised to grant him what he asked. \"I expected  no less from your great magnificence, noble sir,\" replied Don Quixote;  \"and therefore I make bold to tell you, that the boon which I beg, and  you generously condescend to grant me, is, that to-morrow you will be  pleased to bestow the honour of knighthood upon me. This night I will  watch my armour in the chapel of your castle, and then in the morning  you shall gratify me, that I may be duly qualified to seek out  adventures in every corner of the universe, to relieve the distressed,  according to the laws of chivalry and the inclinations of  knights-errant like myself.\" The innkeeper, who, as I said, was a  sharp fellow, and had already a shrewd suspicion of his guest's  disorder, was fully convinced of it when he heard him talk in this  manner; and, to make sport he resolved to humour him, telling him he  was much to be commended for his choice of such an employment, which  was altogether worthy a knight of the first order, such as his gallant  deportment discovered him to be: that he himself had in his youth  followed that profession, ranging through many parts of the world in  search of adventures, till at length he retired to this castle, where  he lived on his own estate and those of others, entertaining all  knights-errant of what quality or condition soever, purely for the  great affection he bore them, and to partake of what they might share  with him in return. He added, that his castle at present had no chapel  where the knight might keep the vigil of his arms, it being pulled  down in order to be new built; but that he knew they might lawfully  be watched in any other place in a case of necessity, and therefore he  might do it that night in the court-yard of the castle; and in the  morning all the necessary ceremonies should be performed, so that he  might assure himself he should be dubbed a knight, nay as much a  knight as any one in the world could be. He then asked Don Quixote  whether he had any money? \"Not a cross,\" replied the knight, \"for I  never read in any history of chivalry that any knight-errant ever  carried money about him.\" \"You are mistaken,\" cried the innkeeper;  \"for admit the histories are silent in this matter, the authors  thinking it needless to mention things so evidently necessary as money  and clean shirts, yet there is no reason to believe the knights went  without either; and you may rest assured, that all the knights-errant,  of whom so many histories are full, had their purses well lined to  supply themselves with necessaries, and carried also with them some  shirts, and a small box of salves to heal their wounds; for they had  not the conveniency of surgeons to cure them every time they fought in  fields and deserts, unless they were so happy as to have some sage or  magician for their friend to give them present assistance, sending  them some damsel or dwarf through the air in a cloud, with a small  bottle of water of so great a virtue, that they no sooner tasted a  drop of it, but their wounds were as perfectly cured as if they had  never received any. But when they wanted such a friend in former ages,  the knights thought themselves obliged to take care that their squires  should be provided with money and other necessaries; and if those  knights ever happened to have no squires, which was but very seldom,  then they carried those things behind them in a little bag. I must  therefore advise you,\" continued he, \"never from this time forwards to  ride without money, nor without the other necessaries of which I spoke  to you, which you will find very beneficial when you least expect it.\"  Don Quixote promised to perform all his injunctions; and so they  disposed every thing in order to his watching his arms in the great  yard. To which purpose the knight, having got them all together, laid  them in a horse-trough close by a well; then bracing his target, and  grasping his lance, just as it grew dark, he began to walk about by  the horse-trough with a graceful deportment. In the mean while, the  innkeeper acquainted all those that were in the house with the  extravagancies of his guest, his watching his arms, and his hopes of  being made a knight. They all marvelled very much at so strange a kind  of folly, and went on to observe him at a distance; where, they saw  him sometimes walk about with a great deal of gravity, and sometimes  lean on his lance, with his eyes all the while fixed upon his arms. It  was now undoubted night, but yet the moon did shine with such a  brightness, as might almost have vied with that of the luminary which  lent it her; so that the knight was wholly exposed to the spectators'  view. While he was thus employed, one of the carriers who lodged in  the inn came out to water his mules, which he could not do without  removing the arms out of the trough. With that, Don Quixote, who saw  him make towards them, cried out to him aloud, \"O thou, whoever thou  art, rash knight, that prepares to lay thy hands on the arms of the  most valorous knight-errant that ever wore a sword, take heed; do not  audaciously attempt to profane them with a touch, lest instant death  be the too sure reward of thy temerity.\" But the carrier regarded not  these threats; and laying hold of the armour without any more ado,  threw it a good way from him; though it had been better for him to  have let it alone; for Don Quixote no sooner saw this, but lifting up  his eyes to heaven, and thus addressing his thoughts, as it seemed, to  his lady Dulcinea; \"Assist me, lady,\" cried he, \"in the first  opportunity that offers itself to your faithful slave; nor let your  favour and protection be denied me in this first trial of my valour!\"  Repeating such-like ejaculations, he let slip his target, and lifting  up his lance with both his hands, he gave the carrier such a terrible  knock on his inconsiderate head with his lance, that he laid him at  his feet in a woful condition; and had he backed that blow with  another, the fellow would certainly have had no need of a surgeon.  This done, Don Quixote took up his armour, laid it again in the  horse-trough, and then walked on backwards and forwards with as great  unconcern as he did at first.    Soon after another carrier, not knowing what had happened, came also  to water his mules, while the first yet lay on the ground in a trance;  but as he offered to clear the trough of the armour, Don Quixote,  without speaking a word, or imploring any one's assistance, once more  dropped his target, lifted up his lance, and then let it fall so  heavily on the fellow's pate, that without damaging his lance, he  broke the carrier's head in three or four places. His outcry soon  alarmed and brought thither all the people in the inn, and the  landlord among the rest; which Don Quixote perceiving, \"Thou Queen of  Beauty,\" cried he, bracing on his shield, and drawing his sword, \"thou  courage and vigour of my weakened heart, now is the time when thou  must enliven thy adventurous slave with the beams of thy greatness,  while this moment he is engaging in so terrible an adventure!\" With  this, in his opinion, he found himself supplied with such an addition  of courage, that had all the carriers in the world at once attacked  him, he would undoubtedly have faced them all. On the other side, the  carriers, enraged to see their comrades thus used, though they were  afraid to come near, gave the knight such a volley of stones, that he  was forced to shelter himself as well as he could under the covert of  his target, without daring to go far from the horse-trough, lest he  should seem to abandon his arms. The innkeeper called to the carriers  as loud as he could to let him alone; that he had told them already he  was mad, and consequently the law would acquit him, though he should  kill them. Don Quixote also made yet more noise, calling them false  and treacherous villains, and the lord of the castle base and  unhospitable, and a discourteous knight, for suffering a knight-errant  to be so abused. \"I would make thee know,\" cried he, \"what a  perfidious wretch thou art, had I but received the order of  knighthood; but for"]]]
