A. cothurnata resembles in many points A. frostiana and it will afford  the collector a very interesting study to note the points of difference.  I found the two species growing on Cemetery Hill. Figure 26 is from  plants collected in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fisher. Found in  September and October.      _Amanita rubescens. Fr._    THE REDDISH AMANITA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 27.--Amanita rubescens. One-third natural size,  caps a dingy reddish-brown, stains reddish when bruised.]    Rubescens is from _rubesco_, to become red. It is so called because of  the dingy reddish color of the entire plant, and also because when the  plant is handled or bruised it quickly changes to a reddish color. It is  often a large bulky plant and rather uninviting.    The pileus is four to six inches broad, dingy reddish, often becoming  pale flesh color, fleshy, oval to convex, then expanded; sprinkled with  small pale warts, unequal, mealy, scattered, white, easily separating;  margin even, faintly striate, especially in wet weather; flesh soft,  white, becoming red when broken.    The gills are white or whitish, free from the stem but reaching it and  forming at times decurrent lines upon it, thin, crowded.    The stem is four or five inches long, nearly cylindrical, solid, though  inclined to be soft within, tapering from the base up, with a bulbous  base which often tapers abruptly below, containing reddish scales, color  dull red. It has seldom any distinct evidence of a volva at the base but  abundant evidence on the cap. Ring large, superior, white, and fragile.    The plant is quite variable in color, sometimes becoming almost white  with a slight reddish or brownish tint. The strong distinguishing  character of the species is the almost entire absence of any remains of  the volva at the base of the stem. By this, and by the dull red hues and  the bruised portions quickly changing to a reddish color, it is easily  distinguished from any of the poisonous Amanitas.    According to Cordier it is largely used as an article of food in France.  Stevenson and Cooke speak well of it. I noticed the small Bohemian boys  gathered it about Salem, Ohio, not having been in this country more than  a week and not being able to speak a word of English. It convinced me  that it was an article of diet in Bohemia and that our species is  similar to theirs. I have found the plants in woods about Bowling Green  and Sidney, Ohio. The plants in Figure 27 were collected on Johnson's  Island, Sandusky, Ohio, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is found  from June to September.      _Amanita aspera. Fr._    ROUGH AMANITA.    Aspera means rough. The pileus is convex, then plane; warts minute,  somewhat crowded, nearly persistent; margin even, rather thin,  increasing in thickness toward the stem; scarcely umbonate, reddish with  various tints of livid and gray; flesh rather solid, white, with tints  of reddish-brown immediately next to the epidermis.    The gills are free, with sometimes a little tooth behind, running down  the stem, white, broad in front.    The stem is white, squamulose, bulb rugulose, ring superior and entire.  The spores are 8x6u.    When the flesh is bruised or eaten by insects it assumes a reddish-brown  color, and in this respect it resembles A. rubescens. The odor is strong  but the taste is not unpleasant. In woods from June till October. The  collector should be sure he knows the plant before he eats it.      _Amanita caesarea. Scop._    THE ORANGE AMANITA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 28.--Amanita caesarea. From a drawing showing the  different stages of the plant. Caps, gills, stem and collar yellow,  volva white.]    [Illustration: _Photo by H. C. Beardslee._    Figure 29.--Amanita caesarea.]    The Orange Amanita is a large, attractive, and beautiful plant. I have  marked it edible, but no one should eat it unless he is thoroughly  acquainted with all the species of the genus Amanita, and then with  great caution. It is said to have been Caesar's favorite mushroom. The  pileus is smooth, hemispherical, bell-shaped, convex, and when fully  expanded nearly flat, the center somewhat elevated and the margin  slightly curved downward; red or orange, fading to yellow on the margin;  usually the larger and well-developed specimens have the deeper and  richer color, the color being always more marked in the center of the  pileus; margin distinctly striate; gills rounded at the stem end and not  attached to the stem, yellow, free and straight. The color of the gills  of matured plants usually is an index to the color of the spores but it  is an exception in this case as the spores are white.    The stem and the flabby membranaceous collar that surrounds it toward  the top are yellow like the gills, the depth of the color varying more  with the size of the plant than is the case with color of the cap.  Sometimes in small and inferior plants the color of both stem and gills  is nearly white, and if the volva is not distinct it is difficult to  distinguish it from the fly mushroom, which is very poisonous. The stem  is hollow, with a soft cottony pith in the young plants.    In very young plants the edge of the collar is attached to the margin of  the cap and conceals the gills, but with the upward growth of the stem  and the expansion of the cap the collar separates from the margin and  remains attached to the stem, where it hangs down upon it like a ruffle.    The expanded cap is usually from three to six inches broad, the stem  from four to six inches long and tapering upward.    When in the button stage, the plant is ovate; and the white color of the  volva, which now entirely surrounds the plant, presents an appearance  much like a hen's egg in size, color, and shape. As the parts within  develop, the volva ruptures in its upper part, the stem elongates and  carries upward the cap, while the remains of the volva surrounds the  base of the stem in the form of a cup.    When the volva first breaks at the apex, it reveals the point of the cap  with its beautiful red color and in contrast with the white volva makes  quite a pretty plant, but with advancing age the red or orange red fades  to a yellow. In drying the specimens the red often entirely disappears.  In young, as well as in old plants, the margin is often prominently  marked with striations, as will be seen in Figures 28 and 29. The flesh  of the plant is white but more or less stained with yellow next to the  epidermis and the gills, which are of that color.    The plant grows in wet weather from July to October. It grows in thin  woods and seems to prefer pine woods and sandy soil. I have found it  from the south tier of counties to the north of our state. It is not,  however, a common plant in Ohio.    From its several names--Caesar's Agaric, Imperial Mushroom, Cibus Deorum,  Kaiserling--one would infer that for ages it had been held in high  esteem as an esculent.    Too great caution cannot be used in distinguishing it from the very  poisonous fly mushroom.      _Amanita spreta. Pk._    HATED AMANITA. POISONOUS.    Spreta, hated. The pileus at first is nearly ovate, slightly umbonate,  then convex, smooth, sometimes fragments of the volva adhering, the  margin striate, whitish or pale-brown toward and on the umbo, soft, dry,  more or less furrowed on the margin.    The flesh is white, thin on the edges, and increasing in thickness  toward the center. Gills close, white, reaching the stem.    The stem is equal, smooth, annulate, stuffed or hollow, whitish, finely  striate at the top from the decurrent lines of the gills, not bulbous at  the base, the volva rather large and inclined to yellowish color. The  spores are elliptical.    The plant resembles the dark forms of the Amanitopsis in having the  marked striations and the entire and closely fitting volva at the base,  but can be easily distinguished by its ring. I found it on Cemetery Hill  in company with the Amanitopsis. It does not seem to root as deep in the  ground as the Amanitopsis. It is very poisonous and should be carefully  studied so that it may be readily recognized and avoided.    It is found in open woods from July to September.      _Amanitopsis. Roze._    Amanitopsis is from _Aminita_ and _opsis_, resembling; so called because  it resembles the Amanita. The principal feature wherein the genus  differs from the Amanita is the absence of a collar on the stem. Its  species are included among the Amanita by many authors. The spores are  white. The gills are free from the stem, and it has a universal veil at  first completely enveloping the young plant, which soon breaks it,  carrying remnants of it on the pileus, where they appear as scattered  warts. It differs from the Lepiota in having a volva.      _Amanitopsis vaginata. Bull._    THE SHEATHED AMANITOPSIS. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 30.--Amanita vaginata. One-third natural size.  Notice a portion of the volva adhering to the cap.]    Vaginata--from _vagina_, a sheath. The plant is edible but should be  used with very great caution. It is quite variable in color, ranging  from white to mouse color, brownish or yellowish.    The pileus is ovate at first, bell-shaped, then convex and expanded,  thin, quite fragile, smooth, when young with a few fragments of the  volva adhering to its surface, deeply and distinctly striate.    The gills are free, white, then pallid, ventricose, broadest in front,  irregular. The flesh is white, but in the darker forms stained under the  easily separating skin. The spores are white and nearly round, 7-10u.    The stem is cylindrical, even or slightly tapering upward, hollow or  stuffed, smooth or sprinkled with downy scales, not bulbous at the base.    The volva is long, thin, fragile, forming a permanent sheath which is  quite soft and readily adheres to the base of the stem.    The striations on the margin are deep and distinct,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29233"],[0,"The 2008 CIA World Factbook (#9)"],[1,"cells resulting in  cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death due to  damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to the brain;  endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of cases and the  majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths occurring in sub-  Saharan Africa.    Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease associated  with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of fever and severe  headache; occasionally produces shock and hemorrhage leading to death  in 5% of cases.
