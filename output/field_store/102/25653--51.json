This explains why salts are usually inactive and  neutral in character, while acids and bases are active agents.  Thus we see why the most positive or the most negative elements  in general have the strongest affinities, while those  intermediate in the list are inactive, and have weak affinities;  why alloys of the metals are weak compounds; why a neutral  substance, like water, has such a weak affinity for the salts  which it holds in solution; and why an aqueous solution is  regarded as a mechanical mixture rather than a chemical compound.  In this view, the division line between chemistry and physics is  not a distinct one. These will be better understood after  studying the chapters on acids, bases and salts.    Chapter XIV.    UNION BY VOLUME.    66. Avogadro's Law of Gases.--Equal volumes of all gases, the  temperature and pressure being the same, have the same number of  molecules. This law is the foundation of modern chemistry. A  cubic centimeter of O has as many molecules as a cubic centimeter  of H, a liter of N the same number as a liter of steam, under  similar conditions. Compare the number of molecules in 5 l. of  N2O with that in 10 l. Cl. 7 cc. vapor of I to 6 cc. vapor of S.  The half-molecules of two gases have, of course, the same  relation to each other, and in elements the half-molecule is  usually the atom.    The molecular volumes--molecules and the surrounding space--of  all gases must therefore be equal, as must the half-volumes.  Notice that this law applies only to gases, not to liquids or  solids. Let us apply it to the experiment for the electrolysis of  water. In this we found twice as much H by volume as O.  Evidently, then, steam has twice as many molecules of H as of O,  and twice as many half-molecules, or atoms. If the molecule has  one atom of O, it must have two of H, and the formula will be  H2O.    Suppose we reverse the process and synthesize steam, which can be  done by passing an electric spark through a mixture of H and O in  a eudiometer over mercury; we should need to take twice as much H  as O. Now when 2 cc. of H combine thus with 1 cc. of O, only 2  cc.of steam are produced. Three volumes are condensed into two  volumes, and of course three molecular volumes into two, three  atomic volumes into two. This may be written as follows:--    H + H + O = H2O.    This is a condensation of one-third.    If 2 l. of chlorhydric acid gas be analyzed, there will result 1  l. of H and 1 l. of Cl. The same relation exists between the  molecules and the atoms, and the reaction is:--    HCl = H + Cl.    Reverse the process, and 1 l. of H unites with 1 l. of Cl to  produce 2 l. of the acid gas; there is no condensation, and the  symbol is HCl. In seven volumes HCl how many of each constituent?    The combination of two volumes of H with one volume of S is found  to produce two volumes of hydrogen sulphide. Therefore two atoms  of H combine with one of S to form a molecule whose symbol is  H2S.    H + H + S = H2S.    What is the condensation in this case?    PROBLEMS.    (1) How many liters of S will it take to unite with 4 l. of H?  How much H2S will be formed?    (2) How many liters of H will it take to combine with 5 l. of S?  How much H2S results?    (3) In 6 l. H2S how many liters H, and how much S? Prove.    (4) In four volumes H2S how many volumes of each constituent?    (5) If three volumes of H be mixed with two volumes of S, so as  to make H2S, how much will be formed? How much of either element  will be left? An analysis of 2 cc. of ammonia gives 1 cc. N and 3  cc. H. The symbol must then be NH3, the reaction,--    NH3 = N + H + H + H.    What condensation in the synthesis of NH3?    In 12 cc. NH3 how many cubic centimeters of each element? In 2  1/2 cc? How much H by volume is required to combine with nine  volumes of N? How many volumes of NH3 are produced?    In elements that have not been weighed in the gaseous state, as  C, the evidence of atomic volume is not direct, but we will  assume it. Thus two volumes of marsh gas would separate into one  of C and four of H. What is its symbol and supposed condensation?  Two volumes of alcohol vapor resolve into two of C, six of H, and  one of O. What is its symbol? its condensation?    The symbol itself of a compound will usually show what its  condensation is; e.g. HCl, HBr, HF, etc., have two atoms; hence  there will be no shrinkage. In H2O, SO2, CO2, the molecule has  three atoms condensed into the space of two, or one-third  shrinkage. In NH3 four volumes are crowded into the space of two,  a condensation of one-half.    P, As, Hg, Zn, have exceptional atomic volumes.    Chapter XV.    ACIDS AND BASES.    66. What Acids Are.    Experiment 39.--Pour a few drops of chlorhydric acid, HCl, into a  clean evaporating-dish. Add 5 cc. H2O, and stir. Touch a drop to  the tongue, noting the taste. Dip into it the end of a piece of  blue litmus paper, and record the result. Thoroughly wash the  dish, then pour in a few drops of nitric acid, HNO3, and 5 cc.  H2O, and stir. Taste, and test with blue litmus. Test in the same  way sulphuric acid, H2SO4. Name two characteristics of an acid.  In a vertical line write the formulae of the acids above. What  element is common to them all? Is the rest of the formula  positive or negative?    67. An Acid is a substance composed of H and a negative element  or radical. It has usually a sour taste, and turns blue litmus  red. Litmus is a vegetable extract obtained from lichens in  Southern Europe. Acids have the same action on many other  vegetable pigments. Are the following acid formulae, and why?  H2SO3, HBr, HNO2, H3PO3, H4SiO4. Most acids have O as well as H.  Complete the symbols for acids in the following list, and name  them, from the type given:--        HCl, chlorhydric acid.    HN03, nitric acid.  ?Br,      ?            ?Cl?       ?  ?I,          ?            ?Br?       ?  ?F,          ?             ?I?        ?  H3PO4, phosphoric acid.    H3PO3, phosphorous acid.  ?As?      ?             ?As?       ?    Complete these equations:--    H2SO3 - H2O = ?       |       2 HN03 - H2O = ?  H2SO4 - H2O = ?       |       2 HNO2 - H2O = ?  H2CO3 - H2O = ?       |       2 H3AsO4 - 3 H2O = ?      Are the products in each case metallic or non-metallic oxides?  They are called anhydrides. Notice that each is formed by the  withdrawal of water from an acid. Reverse the equations; as, SO3  + H2O = ?    68. An Anhydride is what remains after water has been removed  from an acid; or, it is the oxide of a non- metallic element,  which, united with water, forms an acid. SO2 is sulphurous  anhydride, SO2 sulphuric anhydride, the ending ic meaning more O,  or negative element, than ous. Name the others above.    Anhydrides were formerly called acids,--anhydrous acids, in  distinction from hydrated ones, as CO2 even now is often called  carbonic acid.    Experiment 40.--Hold a piece of wet blue litmus paper in the  fumes of SO2, and note the acid test. Try the same with dry  litmus paper.    Experiment 41.--Burn a little S in a receiver of air containing  10 cc. H2O, and loosely covered, as in the O experiment. Then  shake to dissolve the SO2. H2O + SO2 = H2SO3. Apply test paper.    69. Naming Acids.--Compare formulae H2SO3 and H2SO4. Of two acids  having the same elements, the name of the one with least O, or  negative element, ends in ous, the other in ic. H2SO3 is  sulphurous acid, H2SO4, sulphuric acid. Name H3PO4 and H3PO3;  H3AsO3 and H3ASO4; HNO2 and HNO3.    If there are more than two acids in a series, the prefixes hypo,  less, and per, more, are used. The following is such a series:  HClO, HClO2, HClO3, HClO4.    HClO3 is chloric acid; HClO2, chlorous; HClO, hypochlorous; HClO4  perchloric. Hypo means less of the negative element than ous; per  means more of the negative element than ic. Name: H3PO4 (ic),  H3PO3, H3PO2. Also HBrO (HBrO2 does not exist), HBrO3 (ic),  HBrO4.    What are the three most negative elements? Note their occurrence  in the three strongest and most common acids. Hereafter note the  names and symbols of all the acids you see.    70. What Bases Are.    Experiment 42.--Put a few drops of NH4OH into an evaporating-  dish. Add 5 cc. H2O, and stir. Taste a drop. Dip into it a piece  of red litmus paper, noting the effect. Cleanse the dish, and  treat in the same way a few drops NaOH solution, recording the  result. Do the same with KOH. Acid stains on the clothing, with  the exception of those made by HNO3, maybe removed by NH4OH.  H2SO4, however, rapidly destroys the fiber of the cloth.    Name two characteristics of a base. In the formulae of those  bases, what two common elements? Name the radical. Compare those  symbols with the symbol for water, HOH. Is (OH) positive or  negative? Is the other part of each formula positive or negative?  What are two constituents, then, of a base? Bases are called  hydrates. Write in a vertical line five positive elements. Note  the valence of each, and complete the formula for its base. Affix  the names. Can you see any reason why the three bases above given  are the strongest?    Taking the valences of Cr and Fe, write symbols for two sets of  hydrates, and name them. Try to recognize and name every base  hereafter met with.    A Base is a substance which is composed of a metal, or positive  radical, and OH. It generally turns red litmus blue, and often  has an acrid taste.    An Alkali is a base which is readily soluble in water. The three  principal alkalies are NH4OH, KOH, and NaOH.    Alkali Metals are those which form alkalies. Name three.    An Alkaline Reaction is the turning of red litmus blue.    An Acid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],[0,"Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#9)"],[1,"logic failed completely: it believed  that there was only one form of simple proposition (_i.e._ of  proposition not stating a relation between two or more other  propositions), namely, the form which ascribes a predicate to a subject.  This is the appropriate form in assigning the qualities of a given  thing--we may say \"this thing is round, and red, and so on.\" Grammar  favours this form, but philosophically it is so far from universal that  it is not even very common. If we say \"this thing is bigger than that,\"  we are not assigning a mere quality of \"this,\" but a relation of \"this\"  and \"that.\" We might express the same fact by saying \"that thing is  smaller than this,\" where grammatically the subject is changed. Thus  propositions stating that two things have a certain relation have a  different form from subject-predicate propositions, and the failure to  perceive this difference or to allow for it has been the source of many  errors in traditional metaphysics.    The belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the  subject-predicate form--in other words, that every fact consists in some  thing having some quality--has rendered most philosophers incapable of  giving any account of the world of science and daily life. If they had  been honestly anxious to give such an account, they would probably have  discovered their error very quickly; but most of them were less anxious  to understand the world of science and daily life, than to convict it of  unreality in the interests of a super-sensible \"real\" world. Belief in  the unreality of the world of sense arises with irresistible force in  certain moods--moods which, I imagine, have some simple physiological  basis, but are none the less powerfully persuasive. The conviction born  of these moods is the source of most mysticism and of most metaphysics.  When the emotional intensity of such a mood subsides, a man who is in  the habit of reasoning will search for logical reasons in favour of the  belief which he finds in himself. But since the belief already exists,  he will be very hospitable to any reason that suggests itself. The  paradoxes apparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of  mysticism, and are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is  to be in accordance with insight. It is in this way that logic has been  pursued by those of the great philosophers who were mystics--notably  Plato, Spinoza, and Hegel. But since they usually took for granted the  supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines were  presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their disciples  to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from which they  sprang. Nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they remained--to  borrow a useful word from Mr Santayana--\"malicious\" in regard to the  world of science and common sense. It is only so that we can account for  the complacency with which philosophers have accepted the inconsistency  of their doctrines with all the common and scientific facts which seem  best established and most worthy of belief.    The logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are  inherent in anything malicious. While the mystic mood is dominant, the  need of logic is not felt; as the mood fades, the impulse to logic  reasserts itself, but with a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or  at least to prove that it _was_ insight, and that what seems to  contradict it is illusion. The logic which thus arises is not quite  disinterested or candid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the  daily world to which it is to be applied. Such an attitude naturally  does not tend to the best results. Everyone knows that to read an author  simply in order to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to  read the book of Nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is  just as unlikely to lead to understanding. If our logic is to find the  common world intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired  by a genuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among  metaphysicians.    Traditional logic, since it holds that all propositions have the  subject-predicate form, is unable to admit the reality of relations: all  relations, it maintains, must be reduced to properties of the apparently  related terms. There are many ways of refuting this opinion; one of the  easiest is derived from the consideration of what are called  \"asymmetrical\" relations. In order to explain this, I will first explain  two independent ways of classifying relations.    Some relations, when they hold between A and B, also hold between B and  A. Such, for example, is the relation \"brother or sister.\" If A is a  brother or sister of B, then B is a brother or sister of A. Such again  is any kind of similarity, say similarity of colour. Any kind of  dissimilarity is also of this kind: if the colour of A is unlike the  colour of B, then the colour of B is unlike the colour of A. Relations  of this sort are called _symmetrical_. Thus a relation is symmetrical  if, whenever it holds between A and B, it also holds between B and A.    All relations that are not symmetrical are called _non-symmetrical_.  Thus \"brother\" is non-symmetrical, because, if A is a brother of B, it  may happen that B is a _sister_ of A.    A relation is called _asymmetrical_ when, if it holds between A and B,  it _never_ holds between B and A. Thus husband, father, grandfather,  etc., are asymmetrical relations. So are _before_, _after_, _greater_,  _above_, _to the right of_, etc. All the relations that give rise to  series are of this kind.    Classification into symmetrical, asymmetrical, and merely  non-symmetrical relations is the first of the two classifications we had  to consider. The second is into transitive, intransitive, and merely  non-transitive relations, which are defined as follows.    A relation is said to be _transitive_, if, whenever it holds between A  and B and also between B and C, it holds between A and C. Thus _before_,  _after_, _greater_, _above_ are transitive. All relations giving rise to  series are transitive, but so are many others. The transitive relations  just mentioned were asymmetrical, but many transitive relations are  symmetrical--for instance, equality in any respect, exact identity of  colour, being equally numerous (as applied to collections), and so on.    A relation is said to be _non-transitive_ whenever it is not transitive.  Thus \"brother\" is non-transitive, because a brother of one's brother may  be oneself. All kinds of dissimilarity are non-transitive.    A relation is said to be _intransitive_ when, if A has the relation to  B, and B to C, A never has it to C. Thus \"father\" is intransitive. So is  such a relation as \"one inch taller\" or \"one year later.\"    Let us now, in the light of this classification, return to the question  whether all relations can be reduced to predications.    In the case of symmetrical relations--_i.e._ relations which, if they  hold between A and B, also hold between B and A--some kind of  plausibility can be given to this doctrine. A symmetrical relation which  is transitive, such as equality, can be regarded as expressing  possession of some common property, while one which is not transitive,  such as inequality, can be regarded as expressing possession of  different properties. But when we come to asymmetrical relations, such  as before and after, greater and less, etc., the attempt to reduce them  to properties becomes obviously impossible. When, for example, two  things are merely known to be unequal, without our knowing which is  greater, we may say that the inequality results from their having  different magnitudes, because inequality is a symmetrical relation; but  to say that when one thing is _greater_ than another, and not merely  unequal to it, that means that they have different magnitudes, is  formally incapable of explaining the facts. For if the other thing had  been greater than the one, the magnitudes would also have been  different, though the fact to be explained would not have been the same.  Thus mere _difference_ of magnitude is not _all_ that is involved,  since, if it were, there would be no difference between one thing being  greater than another, and the other being greater than the one. We shall  have to say that the one magnitude is _greater_ than the other, and thus  we shall have failed to get rid of the relation \"greater.\" In short,  both possession of the same property and possession of different  properties are _symmetrical_ relations, and therefore cannot account for  the existence of _asymmetrical_ relations.    Asymmetrical relations are involved in all series--in space and time,  greater and less, whole and part, and many others of the most important  characteristics of the actual world. All these aspects, therefore, the  logic which reduces everything to subjects and predicates is compelled  to condemn as error and mere appearance. To those whose logic is not  malicious, such a wholesale condemnation appears impossible. And in fact  there is no reason except prejudice, so far as I can discover, for  denying the reality of relations. When once their reality is admitted,  all _logical_ grounds for supposing the world of sense to be illusory  disappear. If this is to be supposed, it must be frankly and simply on  the ground of mystic insight unsupported by argument. It is impossible  to argue against what professes to be insight, so long as it does not  argue in its own favour. As logicians, therefore, we may admit the  possibility of the mystic's world, while yet, so long as we do not have  his insight, we must continue to study the everyday world with which we  are familiar. But when he contends that our world is impossible, then  our logic is ready to repel his attack. And the first step in creating  the logic which is to perform this service is the recognition of the  reality of relations.   "]]]
