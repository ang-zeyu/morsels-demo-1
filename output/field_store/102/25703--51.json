Joseph Haydn once said, when the worth of  \"Don Giovanni\" was under discussion: \"This I do know, that Mozart  is the greatest composer in the world today.\")    100. \"Nobody can do everything,--jest and terrify, cause laughter  or move profoundly,--like Joseph Haydn.\"    (Reported by Nissen [the biographer who married Mozart's widow.  H.E.K.].)    101. \"Keep your eyes on him; he'll make the world talk of himself  some day!\"    (A remark made by Mozart in reference to Beethoven in the spring  of 1787. It was the only meeting between the two composers. [The  prophetic observation was called out by Beethoven's improvisation  on a theme from \"Le Nozze di Figaro.\" H.E.K.])    102. \"Attwood is a young man for whom I have a sincere affection  and esteem; he conducts himself with great propriety, and I feel  much pleasure in telling you that he partakes more of my style  than any scholar I ever had, and I predict that he will prove a  sound musician.\"    (Remarked in 1786 to Michael Kelly, who was a friend of Attwood  and a pupil of Mozart at the time. [Thomas Attwood was an English  musician, born in 1765. He was chorister of the Chapel Royal at  the age of nine, and at sixteen attracted the attention of the  Prince of Wales, afterward George IV., who sent him to Italy to  study. He studied two years in Naples and one year in Vienna with  Mozart. Returned to London he first composed for the theatre and  afterward largely for the church. He and Mendelssohn were devoted  friends. H.E.K.])    103. \"If the oboist Fischer did not play better when we heard him  in Holland (1766) than he plays now, he certainly does not  deserve the reputation which he has. Yet, between ourselves, I  was too young at the time to pronounce a judgment; I remember  that he pleased me exceedingly, and the whole world. It is  explained easily enough if one but realizes that tastes have  changed mightily since then. You would think that he plays  according to the old school; but no! he plays like a wretched  pupil....And then his concertos, his compositions! Every  ritornello lasts a quarter of an hour; then the hero appears,  lifts one leaden foot after the other and plumps them down  alternately. His tone is all nasal, and his tenuto sounds like an  organ tremulant.\"    (Vienna, April 4, 1787, to his father. Johann Christian  Fischer--1733-1800--was a famous oboist and composer for his  instrument. [Fischer was probably the original of the many artists  of whom the story is told that, having been invited by a nobleman  to dinner, he was asked if he had brought his instrument with him,  replied that he had not, for that his instrument never ate. Kelly  tells the story in his \"Reminiscences\" and makes Fischer the hero.  H.E.K.])    104. \"I know nothing new except that Gellert has died in Leipsic  and since then has written no more poetry.\"    (Milan, January 26, 1770. Wolfgang was on a concert tour with his  father who admired Gellert's writings and had once exchanged  letters with him. The lad seems to have felt ironical.)    105. \"Now I am also acquainted with Herr Wieland; but he doesn't  know me as well as I know him, for he has not heard anything of  mine. I never imagined him to be as he is. He seems to me to be a  little affected in speech, has a rather childish voice, a fixed  stare, a certain learned rudeness, yet, at times, a stupid  condescension. I am not surprised that he behaves as he does here  (and as he would not dare do in Weimar or elsewhere), for the  people look at him as if he had fallen direct from heaven. All  stand in awe, no one talks, everyone is silent, every word is  listened to when he speaks. It is a pity that he keeps people in  suspense so long, for he has a defect of speech which compels him  to speak very slowly and pause after every six words. Otherwise  his is, as we all know, an admirable brain. His face is very  ugly, pockmarked, and his nose rather long. He is a little taller  than papa.\"    (Mannheim, December 27, 1777, to his father. On November 22,  Mozart had reported: \"In the coming carnival 'Rosamunde' will be  performed--new poetry by Herr Wieland, new music by Herr  Schweitzer.\" On January 10, 1778, he writes: \"'Rosamunde' was  rehearsed in the theatre today; it is--good, but nothing more. If  it were bad you could not perform it at all; just as you can't  sleep without going to bed!\")    106. \"Now that Herr Wieland has seen me twice he is entirely  enchanted. The last time we met, after lauding me as highly as  possible, he said, 'It is truly a piece of good fortune for me to  have met you here,' and pressed my hand.\"    (Mannheim, January 10, 1778.)    107. \"Now I give you a piece of news which perhaps you know  already; that godless fellow and arch-rascal, Voltaire, is  dead--died like a dog, like a beast. That is his reward!\"    (Paris, July 3, 1778, to his father, who, like the son, was a man  of sincere piety and abhorred Voltaire's atheism.)    108. \"When God gives a man an office he also gives him sense;  that's the case with the Archduke. Before he was a priest he was  much wittier and intelligent; spoke less but more sensibly. You  ought to see him now! Stupidity looks out of his eyes, he talks  and chatters eternally and always in falsetto. His neck is  swollen,--in short he has been completely transformed.\"    (Vienna, November 17, 1781, to his father. The person spoken of  was Archduke Maximilian, who afterward became Archbishop of  Cologne, and was the patron of Beethoven. [The ambiguity of the  opening statement is probably due to carelessness in writing, or  Mozart's habit of using double negatives. H.E.K.])        WOLFGANG, THE GERMAN        Mozart's Germanism is a matter of pride to the German people. To  him \"German\" was no empty concept, as it was to the majority of  his contemporaries. He is therefore honored as a champion of  German character and German art, worthy as such to stand beside  Richard Wagner. Properly to appreciate his patriotism it is  necessary to hear in mind that in Mozart's day Germany was a  figment of the imagination, the French language, French manners  and Italian music being everywhere dominant. Wagner, on the  contrary, was privileged to see the promise of the fulfillment of  his strivings in the light of the German victories of 1870-1871.  When the genius of Germany soared aloft she carried Wagner with  her; Wagner's days of glory in August, 1876, were conditioned by  the great war with France. How insignificant must the patronage  of Joseph II, scantily enough bestowed on Mozart in comparison  with that showered on Salieri, appear, when we recall the  Maecenas Ludwig II.        109. \"Frequently I fall into a mood of complete listlessness and  indifference; nothing gives me great pleasure. The most  stimulating and encouraging thought is that you, dearest father,  and my dear sister, are well, that I am an honest German, and  that if I am not always permitted to talk I can think what I  please; but that is all.\"    (Paris, May 29, 1778, to his father.)    110. \"The Duke de Guines was utterly without a sense of honor and  thought that here was a young fellow, and a stupid German to  boot,--as all Frenchmen think of the Germans,--he'll be glad to  take it. But the stupid German was not glad and refused to take  the money. For two lessons he wanted to pay me the fee of one.\"    (Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father. Mozart had given lessons in  composition to the Duke's daughter. See No. 51.)    111. \"An Italian ape, such as he is, who has lived in German  countries and eaten German bread for years, ought to speak  German, or mangle it, as well or ill as his French mouth will  permit.\"    (Said of the violoncellist Duport, the favorite of King William  I, of Prussia, in 1789, when Mozart was in Berlin and Duport  asked him to speak French.)    112. \"I pray God every day to give me grace to remain steadfast  here, that I may do honor to myself and the entire German nation,  to His greater honor and glory, and that He permit me to make my  fortune so that I may help you out of your sorry condition, and  bring it to pass that we soon meet again and live together in  happiness and joy. But His will be done on earth as in heaven.\"    (Paris, May 1, 1778, to his father who had plunged himself in  debt and was giving lessons in order to promote the career of his  son. His sister also helped nobly.)    113. \"If this were a place where the people had ears, hearts to  feel, and a modicum of musical understanding and taste, I should  laugh heartily at all these things; as it is I am among nothing  but cattle and brutes (so far as music is concerned). How should  it be otherwise since they are the same in all their acts and  passions? There is no place like Paris. You must not think  that I exaggerate when I talk thus of music. Turn to whom you  please,--except to a born Frenchman,--you shall hear the same  thing, provided you can find some one to turn to. Now that I am  here I must endure out of regard for you. I shall thank God  Almighty if I get out of here with a sound taste.\"    (Paris, May 1, 1778.)    114. \"How popular I would be if I were to lift the national  German stage to recognition in music! And this would surely  happen for I was already full of desire to write when I heard the  German Singspiel.\"    (Munich, October 2, 1777. [A Singspiel is a German opera with  spoken dialogue. H.E.K.])    115. \"If there were but a single patriot on the boards with me, a  different face would be put on the matter. Then, mayhap, the  budding National Theatre would blossom, and that would be an  eternal disgrace to Germany,--if we Germans should once begin to  think German, act German, speak German, and--even sing German!!!\"    (Vienna, March 21, 1785, to the playwright Anton Klein of  Mannheim. It was purposed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#9)"],[1,"ry, its primary form and  import, its meaning for those who projected it.  The thing sank  into their minds, to issue forth again with all the tangle about it of  medieval sentiment and ideas.  In the Doni Madonna in the  Tribune of the Uffizii, Michelangelo actually brings the pagan  religion, and with it the unveiled human form, the sleepy-looking  fauns of a Dionysiac revel, into the presence of the Madonna, as  simpler painters had introduced there other products of the earth,  birds or flowers, while he has given to that Madonna herself  much of the uncouth energy of the older and more primitive  \"Mighty Mother.\"    This picturesque union of contrasts, belonging properly to the art  of the close of the fifteenth century, pervades, in Pico della  Mirandola, an actual person, and that is why the figure of Pico is  so attractive.  He will not let one go; he wins one on, in spite of  one's self, to turn again to the pages of his forgotten books,  although we know already that the actual solution proposed in  them will satisfy us as little as perhaps it satisfied him.  It is said  that in his eagerness for mysterious learning he once paid a great  sum for a collection of cabalistic manuscripts, which turned out  to be forgeries; and [49] the story might well stand as a parable of  all he ever seemed to gain in the way of actual knowledge.  He  had sought knowledge, and passed from system to system, and  hazarded much; but less for the sake of positive knowledge than  because he believed there was a spirit of order and beauty in  knowledge, which would come down and unite what men's  ignorance had divided, and renew what time had made dim.  And  so, while his actual work has passed away, yet his own qualities  are still active, and himself remains, as one alive in the grave,  caesiis et vigilibus oculis, as his biographer describes him, and  with that sanguine, clear skin, decenti rubore interspersa, as with  the light of morning upon it; and he has a true place in that group  of great Italians who fill the end of the fifteenth century with their  names, he is a true humanist.  For the essence of humanism is  that belief of which he seems never to have doubted, that nothing  which has ever interested living men and women can wholly lose  its vitality--no language they have spoken, nor oracle beside  which they have hushed their voices, no dream which has once  been entertained by actual human minds, nothing about which  they have ever been passionate, or expended time and zeal.    1871.      SANDRO BOTTICELLI    [50] IN Leonardo's treatise on painting only one contemporary is  mentioned by name--Sandro Botticelli.  This pre-eminence may  be due to chance only, but to some will rather appear a result of  deliberate judgment; for people have begun to find out the charm  of Botticelli's work, and his name, little known in the last  century, is quietly becoming important.  In the middle of the  fifteenth century he had already anticipated much of that  meditative subtlety, which is sometimes supposed peculiar to the  great imaginative workmen of its close.  Leaving the simple  religion which had occupied the followers of Giotto for a century,  and the simple naturalism which had grown out of it, a thing of  birds and flowers only, he sought inspiration in what to him were  works of the modern world, the writings of Dante and Boccaccio,  and in new readings of his own of classical stories: or, if he  painted religious incidents, painted them with an under-current of  original sentiment, which touches you as the real matter of the  picture through the veil of its ostensible subject.  What [51] is the  peculiar sensation, what is the peculiar quality of pleasure, which  his work has the property of exciting in us, and which we cannot  get elsewhere?  For this, especially when he has to speak of a  comparatively unknown artist, is always the chief question which  a critic has to answer.    In an age when the lives of artists were full of adventure, his life  is almost colourless.  Criticism indeed has cleared away much of  the gossip which Vasari accumulated, has touched the legend of  Lippo and Lucrezia, and rehabilitated the character of Andrea del  Castagno.  But in Botticelli's case there is no legend to dissipate.  He did not even go by his true name: Sandro is a nickname, and  his true name is Filipepi, Botticelli being only the name of the  goldsmith who first taught him art.  Only two things happened to  him, two things which he shared with other artists:--he was  invited to Rome to paint in the Sistine Chapel, and he fell in later  life under the influence of Savonarola, passing apparently almost  out of men's sight in a sort of religious melancholy, which lasted  till his death in 1515, according to the received date.  Vasari says  that he plunged into the study of Dante, and even wrote a  comment on the Divine Comedy.  But it seems strange that he  should have lived on inactive so long; and one almost wishes that  some document might come to light, which, fixing the date of his  death earlier, might relieve one, in thinking of him, of his  dejected old age.    [52] He is before all things a poetical painter, blending the charm  of story and sentiment, the medium of the art of poetry, with the  charm of line and colour, the medium of abstract painting.  So he  becomes the illustrator of Dante.  In a few rare examples of the  edition of 1481, the blank spaces, left at the beginning of every  canto for the hand of the illuminator, have been filled, as far as  the nineteenth canto of the Inferno, with impressions of engraved  plates, seemingly by way of experiment, for in the copy in the  Bodleian Library, one of the three impressions it contains has  been printed upside down, and much awry, in the midst of the  luxurious printed page.  Giotto, and the followers of Giotto, with  their almost childish religious aim, had not learned to put that  weight of meaning into outward things, light, colour, everyday  gesture, which the poetry of the Divine Comedy involves, and  before the fifteenth century Dante could hardly have found an  illustrator.  Botticelli's illustrations are crowded with incident,  blending, with a naïve carelessness of pictorial propriety, three  phases of the same scene into one plate.  The grotesques, so often  a stumbling-block to painters, who forget that the words of a  poet, which only feebly present an image to the mind, must be  lowered in key when translated into visible form, make one regret  that he has not rather chosen for illustration the more subdued  imagery of the Purgatorio.  Yet in the [53] scene of those who  \"go down quick into hell,\" there is an inventive force about the  fire taking hold on the upturned soles of the feet, which proves  that the design is no mere translation of Dante's words, but a true  painter's vision; while the scene of the Centaurs wins one at  once, for, forgetful of the actual circumstances of their  appearance, Botticelli has gone off with delight on the thought of  the Centaurs themselves, bright, small creatures of the woodland,  with arch baby faces and mignon forms, drawing tiny bows.    Botticelli lived in a generation of naturalists, and he might have  been a mere naturalist among them.  There are traces enough in  his work of that alert sense of outward things, which, in the  pictures of that period, fills the lawns with delicate living  creatures, and the hillsides with pools of water, and the pools of  water with flowering reeds.  But this was not enough for him; he  is a visionary painter, and in his visionariness he resembles  Dante.  Giotto, the tried companion of Dante, Masaccio,  Ghirlandajo even, do but transcribe, with more or less refining,  the outward image; they are dramatic, not visionary painters; they  are almost impassive spectators of the action before them.  But  the genius of which Botticelli is the type usurps the data before it  as the exponent of ideas, moods, visions of its own; in this  interest it plays fast and loose with those data, rejecting some and  [54] isolating others, and always combining them anew.  To him,  as to Dante, the scene, the colour, the outward image or gesture,  comes with all its incisive and importunate reality; but awakes in  him, moreover, by some subtle law of his own structure, a mood  which it awakes in no one else, of which it is the double or  repetition, and which it clothes, that all may share it, with visible  circumstance.    But he is far enough from accepting the conventional orthodoxy  of Dante which, referring all human action to the simple formula  of purgatory, heaven and hell, leaves an insoluble element of  prose in the depths of Dante's poetry.  One picture of his, with  the portrait of the donor, Matteo Palmieri, below, had the credit  or discredit of attracting some shadow of ecclesiastical censure.  This Matteo Palmieri, (two dim figures move under that name in  contemporary history,) was the reputed author of a poem, still  unedited, La Città Divina, which represented the human race as  an incarnation of those angels who, in the revolt of Lucifer, were  neither for Jehovah nor for His enemies, a fantasy of that earlier  Alexandrian philosophy about which the Florentine intellect in  that century was so curious.  Botticelli's picture may have been  only one of those familiar compositions in which religious  reverie has recorded its impressions of the various forms of  beatified existence--Glorias, as they were called, like that [55] in  which Giotto painted the portrait of Dante; but somehow it was  suspected of embodying in a picture the wayward dream of  Palmieri, and the chapel where it hung was closed.  Artists so  entire as Botticelli are usually careless about philosophical  theories, even when the philosopher is a Florentine of the  fifteenth century, and his work a poem in terza rima.  But  Botticelli, who wrote a commentary on Dante, and became the  disciple of "]]]
