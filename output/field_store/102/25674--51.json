The argument was a good one, the more that  we may \"suppose\" almost anything, but it must be said that no trace of  any of these creatures has so far been found outside of the strata in  which they have long been known to occur, and all the probabilities are  opposed to this theory. Still, if some of these creatures _had_ been  spared, they might well have passed for sea-serpents, even though  Zeuglodon, the one most like a serpent in form, was the one most  remotely related to snakes.    Zeuglodon, the yoke-tooth, so named from the shape of its great cutting  teeth, was indeed a strange animal, and if we wonder at the Greenland  Whale, whose head is one-third its total length, we may equally wonder  at Zeuglodon, with four feet of head, ten feet of body, and forty feet  of tail. No one, seeing the bones of the trunk and tail for the first  time, would suspect that they belonged to the same animal, for while the  vertebrae of the body are of moderate size, those of the tail are, for  the bulk of creature, the longest known, measuring from fifteen to  eighteen inches in length, and weighing in a fossil condition fifty to  sixty pounds. In life, the animal was from fifty to seventy feet in  length, and not more than six or eight feet through the deepest part of  the body, while the tail was much less; the head was small and pointed,  the jaws well armed with grasping and cutting teeth, and just back of  the head was a pair of short paddles, not unlike those of a fur seal. It  is curious to speculate on the habits of a creature in which the tail  so obviously wagged the dog and whose articulations all point to great  freedom of movement up and down. This may mean that it was an active  diver, descending to great depths to prey upon squid, as the Sperm-Whale  does to-day, while it seems quite certain that it must have reared at  least a third of its great length out of water to take a comprehensive  view of its surroundings. And if size is any indication of power, the  great tail, which obviously ended in flukes like those of a whale, must  have been capable of propelling the beast at a speed of twenty or thirty  miles an hour. Something of the kind must have been needed in order that  the small head might provide food enough for the great tail, and it has  been suggested that inability to do this was the reason why Zeuglodon  became extinct. On the other hand, it has been ingeniously argued that  the huge tail served to store up fat when food was plenty, which was  drawn upon when food became scarce. The fur seals do something similar  to this, for the males come on shore in May rolling in blubber, and  depart in September lean and hungry after a three months' fast.    Zeuglodons must have been very numerous in the old Gulf of Mexico, for  bones are found abundantly through portions of our Southern States; it  was also an inhabitant of the old seas of southern Europe, but, as we  shall see, it gave place to the great fossil shark, and this in turn  passed out of existence. Still, common though its bones may be, stories  of their use for making stone walls--and these stories are still in  circulation--resolve themselves on close scrutiny into the occasional  use of a big vertebra to support the corner of a corn-crib.    The scientific name of Zeuglodon is _Basilosaurus cetoides_, the  whale-like king lizard--the first of these names, _Basilosaurus_, having  been given to it by the original describer, Dr. Harlan, who supposed the  animal to have been a reptile. Now it is a primary rule of nomenclature  that the first name given to an animal must stick and may not be  changed, even by the act of a zooelogical congress, so Zeuglodon must, so  far as its name is concerned, masquerade as a reptile for the rest of  its paleontological life. This, however, really matters very little,  because scientific names are simply verbal handles by which we may grasp  animals to describe them, and Dr. Le Conte, to show how little there may  be in a name, called a beetle Gyascutus. Owen's name of Zeuglodon,  although not tenable as a scientific name, is too good to be wasted, and  being readily remembered and easily pronounced may be used as a popular  name.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Koch's Hydrarchus, Composed of Portions of the  Skeleton of Several Zeuglodons.]    One might think that a creature sixty or seventy feet long was amply  long enough, but Dr. Albert Koch thought otherwise, and did with  Zeuglodon as, later on, he did with the Mastodon, combining the vertebrae  of several individuals until he had a monster 114 feet long! This he  exhibited in Europe under the name of Hydrarchus, or water king, finally  disposing of the composite creature to the Museum of Dresden, where it  was promptly reduced to its proper dimensions. The natural make-up of  Zeuglodon is sufficiently composite without any aid from man, for the  head and paddles are not unlike those of a seal, the ribs are like those  of a manatee, and the shoulder blades are precisely like those of a  whale, while the vertebrae are different from those of any other animal,  even its own cousin and lesser contemporary Dorudon. There were also  tiny hind legs tucked away beneath skin, but these, as well as many  other parts of the animal's structure were unknown, until Mr. Charles  Schuchert collected a series of specimens for the National Museum, from  which it was possible to restore the entire skeleton. Owing to a rather  curious circumstance the first attempt at a restoration was at fault;  among the bones originally obtained by Mr. Schuchert there were none  from the last half of the tail, an old gully having cut off the hinder  portion of the backbone and destroyed the vertebrae. Not far away,  however, was a big lump of stone containing several vertebrae of just the  right size, and these were used as models to complete the papier-mache  skeleton shown at Atlanta, in 1894. But a year after Mr. Schuchert  collected a series of vertebrae, beginning with the tip of the tail, and  these showed conclusively that the first lot of tail vertebrae belonged  to a creature still undescribed and one probably more like a whale than  Zeuglodon himself, whose exact relationships are a little uncertain, as  may be imagined from what was said of its structure. Mixed with the  bones of Zeuglodon was the shell of a turtle, nearly three feet long,  and part of the backbone of a great water-snake that must have been  twenty-five feet long, both previously quite unknown. One more curious  thing about Zeuglodon bones remains to be told, and then we are done  with him; ordinarily a fossil bone will break indifferently in any  direction, but the bones of Zeuglodon are built, like an onion, of  concentric layers, and these have a great tendency to peel off during  the preparation of a specimen.           *       *       *       *       *    And now, as the wheels of time and change rolled slowly on, sharks again  came uppermost, and the warmer Eocene and Miocene oceans appear to have  fairly teemed with these sea wolves. There were small sharks with  slender teeth for catching little fishes, there were larger sharks with  saw-like teeth for cutting slices out of larger fishes, and there were  sharks that might almost have swallowed the biggest fish of to-day  whole, sharks of a size the waters had never before contained, and  fortunately do not contain now. We know these monsters mostly by their  teeth, for their skeletons were cartilaginous, and this absence of their  remains is probably the reason why these creatures are passed by while  the adjectives huge, immense, enormous are lavished on the Mosasaurs and  Plesiosaurs--animals that the great-toothed shark, _Carcharodon  megalodon_, might well have eaten at a meal. For the gaping jaws of one  of these sharks, with its hundreds of gleaming teeth must, at a moderate  estimate, have measured not less than six feet across.    The great White Shark, the man-eater, so often found in story books, so  rarely met with in real life, attains a length of thirty feet, and a man  just makes him a good, satisfactory lunch. Now a tooth of this shark is  an inch and a quarter long, while a tooth of the huge _Megalodon_ is  commonly three, often four, and not infrequently five inches long.  Applying the rule of three to such a tooth as this would give a shark  120 feet long, bigger than most whales, to whom a man would be but a  mouthful, just enough to whet his sharkship's appetite. Even granting  that the rule of three unduly magnifies the dimensions of the brute, and  making an ample reduction, there would still remain a fish between  seventy-five and one hundred feet long, quite large enough to satisfy  the most ambitious of _tuna_ fishers, and to have made bathing in the  Miocene ocean unpopular. Contemporary with the great-toothed shark was  another and closely related species that originated with him in Eocene  times, and these two may possibly have had something to do with the  extinction of Zeuglodon. This species is distinguished by having on  either side of the base of the great triangular cutting teeth a little  projection or cusp, like the \"ear\" on a jar, so that this species has  been named _auriculatus_, or eared. The edges of the teeth are also more  saw-like than in those of its greater relative, and as the species must  have attained a length of fifty or sixty feet it may, with its better  armature, have been quite as formidable. And, as perhaps the readers of  these pages may know, the supply of teeth never ran short. Back of each  tooth, one behind another arranged in serried ranks, lay a reserve of  six or seven smaller, but growing teeth, and whenever a tooth of the  front row was lost, the tooth immediately behind it took its place, and  like a well-trained soldier kept the front line unbroken. Thus the teeth  of sharks are continually developing at the back, and all the teeth are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#9)"],[1,"did not expose them  now, it was because he kept them as a good general keeps his reserve,  for the purpose of deciding the victory.    Mme. Gypsy was intelligent enough to divine these reasons.    \"Reasons for my hiding! Prosper wishes, then, to keep everyone in  ignorance of our intimacy.\"    She remained thoughtful for a moment; then a ray of light seemed to  cross her mind, and she cried:    \"Oh, I understand now! Fool that I was for not seeing it before! My  presence here, where I have been for a year, would be an overwhelming  charge against him. An inventory of my possessions would be taken--of my  dresses, my laces, my jewels--and my luxury would be brought against him  as a crime. He would be asked to tell where he obtained so much money to  lavish all these elegancies on me.\"    The detective bowed, and said:    \"That is true, madame.\"    \"Then I must fly, monsieur, at once. Who knows that the police are not  already warned, and may appear at any moment?\"    \"Oh,\" said Fanferlot with easy assurance, \"you have plenty of time; the  police are not so very prompt.\"    \"No matter!\"    And, leaving the detective alone in the parlor, Mme. Nina hastily  ran into her bedroom, and calling her maid, her cook, and her little  footman, ordered them to empty her bureau and chests of their contents,  and assisted them to stuff her best clothing and jewels into her trunks.    Suddenly she rushed back to Fanferlot and said:    \"Everything will be ready to start in a few minutes, but where am I to  go?\"    \"Did not M. Bertomy say, my dear lady, to the other end of Paris? To a  hotel, or furnished apartments.\"    \"But I don't know where to find any.\"    Fanferlot seemed to be reflecting; but he had great difficulty in  concealing his delight at a sudden idea that flashed upon him; his  little black eyes fairly danced with joy.    \"I know of a hotel,\" he said at last, \"but it might not suit you. It is  not elegantly furnished like this room.\"    \"Would I be comfortable there?\"    \"Upon my recommendation you would be treated like a queen, and, above  all, concealed.\"    \"Where is it?\"    \"On the other side of the river, Quai Saint Michel, the Archangel, kept  by Mme. Alexandre.\"    Mme. Nina was never long making up her mind.    \"Here are pen and paper; write your recommendation.\"    He rapidly wrote, and handed her the letter.    \"With these three lines, madame, you can make Mme. Alexandre do anything  you wish.\"    \"Very good. Now, how am I to let Cavaillon know my address? It was he  who should have brought me Prosper's letter.\"    \"He was unable to come, madame,\" interrupted the detective, \"but I will  give him your address.\"    Mme. Gypsy was about to send for a carriage, but Fanferlot said he was  in a hurry, and would send her one. He seemed to be in luck that day;  for a cab was passing the door, and he hailed it.    \"Wait here,\" he said to the driver, after telling him that he was a  detective, \"for a little brunette who is coming down with some trunks.  If she tells you to drive her to Quai Saint Michel, crack your whip; if  she gives you any other address, get down from your seat, and arrange  your harness. I will keep in sight.\"    He stepped across the street, and stood in the door of a wine-store.  He had not long to wait. In a few minutes the loud cracking of a whip  apprised him that Mme. Nina had started for the Archangel.    \"Aha,\" said he, gayly, \"I told _her_, at any rate.\"          IV    At the same hour that Mme. Nina Gypsy was seeking refuge at the  Archangel, so highly recommended by Fanferlot the Squirrel, Prosper  Bertomy was being entered on the jailer's book at the police office.    Since the moment when he had resumed his habitual composure, he had not  faltered.    Vainly did the people around him watch for a suspicious expression, or  any sign of giving way under the danger of his situation.    His face was like marble.    One would have supposed him insensible to the horrors of his condition,  had not his heavy breathing, and the beads of perspiration standing on  his brow, betrayed the intense agony he was suffering.    At the police office, where he had to wait two hours while the  commissary went to receive orders from higher authorities, he entered  into conversation with the two bailiffs who had charge of him.    At twelve o'clock he said he was hungry, and sent to a restaurant near  by for his breakfast, which he ate with a good appetite; he also drank  nearly a bottle of wine.    While he was thus occupied, several clerks from the prefecture, who  have to transact business daily with the commissary of police, curiously  watched him. They all formed the same opinion, and admiringly said to  each other:    \"Well, he is made of strong material, he is!\"    \"Yes, my dandy looks too lamb-like to be left to his own devices. He  ought to have a strong escort.\"    When he was told that a coach was waiting for him at the door, he at  once got up; but, before going out, he requested permission to light a  cigar, which was granted.    A flower-girl stood just by the door, with her stand filled with all  varieties of flowers. He stopped and bought a bunch of violets. The  girl, seeing that he was arrested, said, by way of thanks:    \"Good luck to you, my poor gentleman!\"    He appeared touched by this mark of interest, and replied:    \"Thanks, my good woman, but 'tis a long time since I have had any.\"    It was magnificent weather, a bright spring morning. As the coach went  along Rue Montmartre, Prosper kept his head out of the window, at the  same time smilingly complaining at being imprisoned on such a lovely  day, when everything outside was so sunny and pleasant.    \"It is singular,\" he said, \"I never felt so great a desire to take a  walk.\"    One of the bailiffs, a large, jovial, red-faced man, received this  remark with a hearty burst of laughter, and said:    \"I understand.\"    To the court clerk, while he was going through the formalities of the  commitment, Prosper replied with haughty brevity to the indispensable  questions asked him.    But when he was ordered to empty his pockets on the table, and they  began to search him, his eyes flashed with indignation, and a single  tear dropped upon his flushed cheek. In an instant he had recovered his  stony calmness, and stood up motionless, with his arms raised in the air  so that the rough creatures about him could more conveniently ransack  him from head to foot, to assure themselves that he had no suspicious  object hid under his clothes.    The search would have, perhaps, been carried to the most ignominious  lengths, but for the intervention of a middle-aged man of rather  distinguished appearance, who wore a white cravat and gold spectacles,  and was sitting quite at home by the fire.    He started with surprise, and seemed much agitated, when he saw Prosper  brought in by the bailiffs; he stepped forward, and seemed about to  speak to him, then suddenly changed his mind, and sat down again.    In spite of his own troubles, Prosper could not help seeing that this  man kept his eyes fastened upon him. Did he know him? Vainly did he try  to recollect having met him before.    This man, treated with all the deference due to a chief, was no less a  personage than M. Lecoq, a celebrated member of the detective corps.    When the men who were searching Prosper were about to take off his  boots, saying that a knife might be concealed in them. M. Lecoq waved  them aside with an air of authority, and said:    \"You have done enough.\"    He was obeyed. All the formalities being ended, the unfortunate cashier  was taken to a narrow cell; the heavily barred door was swung to and  locked upon him; he breathed freely; at last he was alone.    Yes, he believed himself to be alone. He was ignorant that a prison is  made of glass, that the accused is like a miserable insect under the  microscope of an entomologist. He knew not that the walls have stretched  ears and watchful eyes.    He was so sure of being alone that he at once gave vent to his  suppressed feelings, and, dropping his mask of impassibility, burst  into a flood of tears. His long-restrained anger now flashed out like a  smouldering fire.    In a paroxysm of rage he uttered imprecations and curses. He dashed  himself against the prison-walls like a wild beast in a cage.    Prosper Bertomy was not the man he appeared to be.    This haughty, correct gentleman had ardent passions and a fiery  temperament.    One day, when he was about twenty-four years of age, he had become  suddenly fired by ambition. While all of his desires were repressed,  imprisoned in his low estate, like an athlete in a strait-jacket, seeing  around him all these rich people with whom money assumed the place of  the wand in the fairy-tale, he envied their lot.    He studied the beginnings of these financial princes, and found that at  the starting-point they possessed far less than himself.    How, then, had they succeeded? By force of energy, industry, and  assurance.    He determined to imitate and excel them.    From this day, with a force of will much less rare than we think, he  imposed silence upon his instincts. He reformed not his morals, but his  manners; and so strictly did he conform to the rules of decorum, that  he was regarded as a model of propriety by those who knew him, and had  faith in his character; and his capabilities and ambition inspired the  prophecy that he would be successful in attaining eminence and wealth.    And the end of all was this: imprisoned for robbery; that is, ruined!    For he did not attempt to deceive himself. He knew that, guilty or  innocent, a man once suspected is as ineffaceably branded as the  shoulder of a galley-slave.    Therefore what was the use of struggling? What benefit was a triumph  which could not wash out the stain?    When the jailer brought him his supper, he found him lying on his  pallet, with his face buried in the pillow, weeping bitterly."]]]
