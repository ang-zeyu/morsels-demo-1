[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#9)"],[1," began pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets.  Instead  of opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a  good-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all  sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.    Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and  the Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to  follow her.  At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass  again, and as the little man realized that they were all about to be  entombed in the mountain he said to the children:    \"My dears, what shall we do?  Jump out and fight?\"    \"What's the use?\" replied Dorothy.  \"I'd as soon die here as live much  longer among these cruel and heartless people.\"    \"That's the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds.  \"I've had enough of the Mangaboos.\"    \"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm with you, whatever you decide.  But  we can't live long in this cavern, that's certain.\"    Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,  patted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed them  carefully in his inside pocket.    Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns.  The rays of the  colored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinks  had been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the  Land of the Mangaboos.    \"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I'll explore it and see,\" replied the boy.    So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy and  the Wizard followed at his side.  The cavern did not come to an end, as  they had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glass  mountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the side  opposite the Mangaboo country.    \"It isn't a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it it  might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black  pocket we are now in.  I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid  to enter this cavern because it is dark; but we have our lanterns to  light the way, so I propose that we start out and discover where this  tunnel in the mountain leads to.\"    The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the  boy began to harness Jim to the buggy.  When all was in readiness the  three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along  the way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted  lantern so the horse could see where to go.    Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed  the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor  was usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any  accident.  Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather  steep and tiresome.    \"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" said  Dorothy.  \"I didn't know this mountain was so tall.\"    \"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"  added Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started.\"    But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with  his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the  lanterns to save the oil.    To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for  all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had  made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays.  The sides of  the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and  the floor became more level.  Jim hastened his lagging steps at this  assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments  more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to  face with a new and charming country.          8.  The Valley of Voices      By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful  valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another  rugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty  green hills at the ends.  It was all laid out into lovely lawns and  gardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful  and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there.  There were  orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our  world.  Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their  flower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the  quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld.  None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had  ample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.    As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were  enraptured by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft  air, which they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of  the tunnel.  Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before  they noticed two very singular and unusual facts about this valley.  One was that it was lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon  was in the arched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a  clear and perfect light.  The second and even more singular fact was  the absence of any inhabitant of this splendid place.  From their  elevated position they could overlook the entire valley, but not a  single moving object could they see.  All appeared mysteriously  deserted.    The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to  granite.  With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the  loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and  orchards and gardens began.  The nearest cottage was still some  distance away.    \"Isn't it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out of  the buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.    \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb.  \"We were lucky to get away from those  dreadful vegetable people.\"    \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we  were obliged to live here always.  We couldn't find a prettier place,  I'm sure.\"    He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and  Jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very  contented in his new surroundings.    \"We can't walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried  it and failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and  the Wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth then they  had been in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and  natural.    \"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.    The little man shook his bald head.    \"Can't imagine, my dear,\" he replied.    They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the  creature anywhere.  Slowly they walked along the path toward the  nearest cottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim  pausing at every step for another mouthful of grass.    Presently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves,  in the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach.  The fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so  appetizing and delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:    \"What is it, do you s'pose?\"    The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could  reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had  rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.    \"It's good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn't have  gobbled it up so greedily.\"    \"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.    They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.    \"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away.  But I didn't  see them go; did you?\"    \"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.    \"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.    Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the  Wizard could not discover a single piglet.    \"Where are you?\" he asked.    \"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice.  \"Can't you see us?\"    \"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.    \"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.    The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the  small fat body of one of his pets.  He picked it up, but could not see  what he held.    \"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly.  \"The piglets have become  invisible, in some curious way.\"    \"I'll bet it's because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten.    \"It wasn't a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy.  \"I only hope it wasn't  poison.\"    \"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets.    \"We'll eat all we can find of them,\" said another.    \"But WE mus'n't eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we too  may become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another of  the strange fruit we must avoid it.\"    Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put  them away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could  feel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for  the present.    The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they  presently reached.  It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly  over the broad front porch.  The door stood open and a table was set in  the front room, with four chairs drawn up to it.  On the table were  plates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits.  The  meat was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange  antics and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way.  But not a  single person appeared to be in the room.    \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood  in the doorway.    A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to  the plates with a clatter.  One of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4204"],[0,"The Elements of Geology (#9)"],[1,"above is deposited by  evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called STALACTITES.  As the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same  way thicker masses called STALAGMITES, which may grow to join the  stalactites above, forming pillars. A stalagmitic crust often  seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns, together  with whatever relics of cave dwellers, either animals or men, it  may contain.    Can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of  single drops are often hollow pipes?    THE ZONE OF CEMENTATION. With increasing depth subterranean water  becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more  highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above. At  such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks,  cementing their grains together, and in crevices and fissures,  forming mineral veins. Thus below the zone of solution where the  work of water is to dissolve, lies the zone of cementation where  its work is chemical deposit. A part of the invisible load of  waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at  greater depths.    As the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the  work of rain and streams, rocks which have lain deep within the  zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution. Thus  there are exposed to view limestones, whose cracks were filled  with calcite (crystallized carbonate of lime), with quartz or  other minerals, and sandstones whose grains were well cemented  many feet below the surface.    CAVITY FILLING. Small cavities in the rocks are often found more  or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by  water in its constant circulation underground. The process may be  illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of  evaporating brine, but in the latter instance the solution is not  renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks. A cavity thus  lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a GEODE.    CONCRETIONS. Ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may  gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses  called concretions. Thus silica disseminated through limestone is  gathered into nodules of flint. While geodes grow from the outside  inwards, concretions grow outwards from the center. Nor are they  formed in already existing cavities as are geodes. In soft clays  concretions may, as they grow, press the clay aside. In many other  rocks concretions are made by the process of REPLACEMENT. Molecule  by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion  substituted in its place. The concretion may in this way preserve  intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock. Clays  and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate, of iron  carbonate, or of iron sulphide. Some fossil, such as a leaf or  shell, frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion  grows.    Why are building stones more easily worked when \"green\" than after  their quarry water has dried out?    DEPOSITS OF GROUND WATER IN ARID REGIONS. In arid lands where  ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there  evaporates, it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held  in solution. White limy incrustations of this nature cover  considerable tracts in northern Mexico. Evaporating beneath the  surface, ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose  sand and gravel. Such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in  western Kansas and Nebraska, where they are known as \"mortar  beds.\"    THERMAL SPRINGS. While the lower limit of surface drainage is sea  level, subterranean water circulates much below that depth, and is  brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure. In many  instances springs have a higher temperature than the average  annual temperature of the region, and are then known as thermal  springs. In regions of present or recent volcanic activity, such  as the Yellowstone National Park, we may believe that the heat of  thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas, perhaps not far  below the surface. But when hot springs occur at a distance of  hundreds of miles from any volcano, as in the case of the hot  springs of Bath, England, it is probable that their waters have  risen from the heated rocks of the earth's interior. The springs  of Bath have a temperature of 120 degrees F., 70 degrees above the  average annual temperature of the place. If we assume that the  rate of increase in the earth's internal heat is here the average  rate, 1 degree F. to every sixty feet of descent, we may conclude  that the springs of Bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two  hundred feet.    Water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought  back by hydrostatic pressure. It is absorbed by highly heated  rocks deep below the surface. From time to time some of this deep-  seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic  eruptions.    SURFACE DEPOSITS OF SPRINGS. Where subterranean water returns to  the surface highly charged with minerals in solution, on exposure  to the air it is commonly compelled to lay down much of its  invisible load in chemical deposits about the spring. These are  thrown down from solution either because of cooling, evaporation,  the loss of carbon dioxide, or the work of algae.    Many springs have been charged under pressure with carbon dioxide  from subterranean sources and are able therefore to take up large  quantities of lime carbonate from the limestone rocks through  which they pass. On reaching the surface the pressure is relieved,  the gas escapes, and the lime carbonate is thrown down in deposits  called TRAVERTINE. The gas is sometimes withdrawn and the deposit  produced in large part by the action of algae and other humble  forms of plant life.    At the Mammoth Hot Springs in the valley of the Gardiner River,  Yellowstone National Park, beautiful terraces and basins of  travertine are now building, chiefly by means of algae which cover  the bottoms, rims, and sides of the basins and deposit lime  carbonate upon them in successive sheets. The rock, snow-white  where dry, is coated with red and orange gelatinous mats where the  algae thrive in the over-flowing waters.    Similar terraces of travertine are found to a height of fourteen  hundred feet up the valley side. We may infer that the springs  which formed these ancient deposits discharged near what was then  the bottom of the valley, and that as the valley has been deepened  by the river the ground water of the region has found lower and  lower points of issue.    In many parts of the country calcareous springs occur which coat  with lime carbonate mosses, twigs, and other objects over which  their waters flow. Such are popularly known as petrifying springs,  although they merely incrust the objects and do not convert them  into stone.    Silica is soluble in alkaline waters, especially when these are  hot. Hot springs rising through alkaline siliceous rocks, such as  lavas, often deposit silica in a white spongy formation known as  SILICEOUS SINTER, both by evaporation and by the action of algae  which secrete silica from the waters. It is in this way that the  cones and mounds of the geysers in the Yellowstone National Park  and in Iceland have been formed.    Where water oozes from the earth one may sometimes see a rusty  deposit on the ground, and perhaps an iridescent scum upon the  water. The scum is often mistaken for oil, but at a touch it  cracks and breaks, as oil would not do. It is a film of hydrated  iron oxide, or LIMONITE, and the spring is an iron, or chalybeate,  spring. Compounds of iron have been taken into solution by ground  water from soil and rocks, and are now changed to the insoluble  oxide on exposure to the oxygen of the air.    In wet ground iron compounds leached by ground water from the soil  often collect in reddish deposits a few feet below the surface,  where their downward progress is arrested by some impervious clay.  At the bottom of bogs and shallow lakes iron ores sometimes  accumulate to a depth of several feet.    Decaying organic matter plays a large part in these changes. In  its presence the insoluble iron oxides which give color to most  red and yellow rocks are decomposed, leaving the rocks of a gray  or bluish color, and the soluble iron compounds which result are  readily leached out,--effects seen where red or yellow clays have  been bleached about some decaying tree root.    The iron thus dissolved is laid down as limonite when oxidized, as  about a chalybeate spring; but out of contact with the air and in  the presence of carbon dioxide supplied by decaying vegetation, as  in a peat bog, it may be deposited as iron carbonate, or SIDERITE.    TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNDERGROUND WATERS. In order to realize the vast  work in solution and cementation which underground waters are now  doing and have done in all geological ages, we must gain some  conception of their amount. At a certain depth, estimated at about  six miles, the weight of the crust becomes greater than the rocks  can bear, and all cavities and pores in them must be completely  closed by the enormous pressure which they sustain. Below a depth  of even three or four miles it is believed that ground water  cannot circulate. Estimating the average pore spaces of the  different rocks of the earth's crust above this depth, and the  average per cents of their pore spaces occupied by water, it has  been recently computed that the total amount of ground water is  equal to a sheet of water one hundred feet deep, covering the  entire surface of the earth.            CHAPTER III    RIVERS AND VALLEYS      THE RUN-OFF. We have traced the history of that portion of the  rainfall which soaks into the ground; let us now return to that  part which washes along the surface and is known as the RUN-OFF.  Fed by rains and melting snows, the run-off gathers into courses,"]]]
