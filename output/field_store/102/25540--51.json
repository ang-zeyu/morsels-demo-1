[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#9)"],[1,"was  everywhere rife. Meetings were broken up, negro quarters attacked,  property destroyed, murders committed.    Fair-minded men became abolitionists on account of the crusade against  the rights of white men quite as much as from their interest in the  rights of negroes. Salmon P. Chase of Ohio was led to espouse the cause  by observing the attacks upon the freedom of the press in Cincinnati.  Gerrit Smith witnessed the breaking up of an anti-slavery meeting in  Utica, New York, and thereafter consecrated his time, his talents, and  his great wealth to the cause of liberty. Wendell Phillips saw Garrison  in the hands of a Boston mob, and that experience determined him to make  common cause with the martyr. And the murder of Lovejoy in 1837 made  many active abolitionists.    It is difficult to imagine a more inoffensive practice than giving  to negro girls the rudiments of an education. Yet a school for this  purpose, taught by Miss Prudence Crandall in Canterbury, Connecticut,  was broken up by persistent persecution, a special act of the  Legislature being passed for the purpose, forbidding the teaching  of negroes from outside the State without the consent of the town  authorities. Under this act Miss Crandall was arrested, convicted, and  imprisoned.    Having eliminated free discussion from the South, the Southern States  sought to accomplish the same object in the North. In pursuance of a  resolution of the Legislature, the Governor of Georgia offered a reward  of five thousand dollars to any one who should arrest, bring to trial,  and prosecute to conviction under the laws of Georgia the editor of  the Liberator. R. G. Williams, publishing agent for the American  Anti-Slavery Society, was indicted by a grand jury of Tuscaloosa County,  Alabama, and Governor Gayle of Alabama made a requisition on Governor  Marcy of New York for his extradition. Williams had never been in  Alabama. His offense consisted in publishing in the New York Emancipator  a few rather mild utterances against slavery.    Governor McDuffie of South Carolina in an official message declared  that slavery was the very corner-stone of the republic, adding that  the laboring population of any country, \"bleached or unbleached,\" was  a dangerous element in the body politic, and predicting that within  twenty-five years the laboring people of the North would be virtually  reduced to slavery. Referring to abolitionists, he said: \"The laws of  every community should punish this species of interference with death  without benefit of clergy.\" Pursuant to the Governor's recommendation,  the Legislature adopted a resolution calling upon non-slaveholding  States to pass laws to suppress promptly and effectively all abolition  societies. In nearly all the slave States similar resolutions  were adopted, and concerted action against anti-slavery effort was  undertaken. During the winter of 1835 and 1836, the Governors of the  free States received these resolutions from the South and, instead of  resenting them as an uncalled-for interference with the rights of free  commonwealths, they treated them with respect. Edward Everett, Governor  of Massachusetts, in his message presenting the Southern documents to  the Legislature, said: \"Whatever by direct and necessary operation is  calculated to excite an insurrection among the slaves has been held, by  highly respectable legal authority, an offense against this Commonwealth  which may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor at common law.\" Governor Marcy  of New York, in a like document, declared that \"without the power to  pass such laws the States would not possess all the necessary means for  preserving their external relations of peace among themselves.\" Even  before the Southern requests reached Rhode Island, the Legislature had  under consideration a bill to suppress abolition societies.    When a committee of the Massachusetts Legislature had been duly  organized to consider the documents received from the slave States, the  abolitionists requested the privilege of a hearing before the committee.  Receiving no reply, they proceeded to formulate a statement of their  case; but before they could publish it, they were invited to appear  before the joint committee of the two houses. The public had been  aroused by the issue and there was a large audience. The case for  the abolitionists was stated by their ablest speakers, among whom was  William Lloyd Garrison. They labored to convince the committee that  their utterances were not incendiary, and that any legislative censure  directed against them would be an encouragement to mob violence and the  persecution which was already their lot. After the defensive arguments  had been fully presented, William Goodell took the floor and proceeded  to charge upon the Southern States which had made these demands a  conspiracy against the liberties of the North. In the midst of great  excitement and many interruptions by the chairman of the committee, he  quoted the language of Governor McDuffie's message, and characterized  the documents lying on the table before him as \"fetters for Northern  freemen.\" Then, turning to the committee, he began, \"Mr. Chairman, are  you prepared to attempt to put them on?\"--but the sentence was only half  finished when the stentorian voice of the chairman interrupted him: \"Sit  down, sir!\" and he sat down. The committee then arose and left the room.  But the audience did not rise; they waited till other abolitionists  found their tongues and gave expression to a fixed determination to  uphold the liberties purchased for them by the blood of their fathers.  The Massachusetts Legislature did not comply with the request of  Governor McDuffie of South Carolina to take the first step towards the  enslavement of all laborers, white as well as black. And Rhode Island  refused to enact into law the pending bill for the suppression of  anti-slavery societies. They declined to violate the plain requirements  of their Constitution that the interests of slavery might be promoted.  Not many years later they were ready to strain or break the Constitution  for the sake of liberty.    In the general crusade against liberty churches proved more pliable  than States. The authority of nearly all the leading denominations  was directed against the abolitionists. The General Conference of the  Methodist Episcopal Church passed in 1836 a resolution censuring two of  their members who had lectured in favor of modern abolitionism. The  Ohio Conference of the same denomination had passed resolutions urging  resistance to the anti-slavery movement. In June, 1836, the New York  Conference decided that no one should be chosen as deacon or elder who  did not give pledge that he would refrain from agitating the church on  the subject.    The same spirit appeared in theological seminaries. The trustees of Lane  Seminary, near Cincinnati, Ohio, voted that students should not organize  or be members of anti-slavery societies or hold meetings or lecture or  speak on the subject. Whereupon the students left in a body, and many  of the professors withdrew and united with others in the founding of an  anti-slavery college at Oberlin.    A persistent attack was also directed against the use of the United  States mails for the distribution of anti-slavery literature. Mob  violence which involved the post-office began as early as 1830, when  printed copies of Miss Grimke's Appeal to the Christian Women of the  South were seized and burned in Charleston. In 1835 large quantities of  anti-slavery literature were removed from the Charleston office and  in the presence of the assembled citizens committed to the flames.  Postmasters on their own motion examined the mails and refused  to deliver any matter that they deemed incendiary. Amos Kendall,  Postmaster-General, was requested to issue an order authorizing such  conduct. He replied that he had no legal authority to issue such an  order. Yet he would not recommend the delivery of such papers. \"We owe,\"  said he, \"an obligation to the laws, but a higher one to the communities  in which we live, and if the former be perverted to destroy the latter,  it is patriotism to disregard them. Entertaining these views, I cannot  sanction, and will not condemn, the step you have taken.\" This is an  early instance of the appeal to the \"higher law\" in the pro-slavery  controversy. The higher law was invoked against the freedom of the  press. The New York postmaster sought to dissuade the Anti-slavery  Society from the attempt to send its publications through the mails into  Southern States. In reply to a request for authorization to refuse to  accept such publications, the Postmaster-General replied: \"I am  deterred from giving an order to exclude the whole series of abolition  publications from the Southern mails only by a want of legal power, and  if I were situated as you are, I would do as you have done.\"    Mr. Kendall's letters to the postmasters of Charleston and New York  were written in July and August, 1835. In December of the same year,  presumably with full knowledge that a member of his Cabinet was  encouraging violations of law in the interest of slavery, President  Jackson undertook to supply the need of legal authorization. In his  annual message he made a savage attack upon the abolitionists and  recommended to Congress the \"passing of such a law as will prohibit,  under severe penalties, the circulation in the Southern States, through  the mail, of incendiary publications.\"    This part of the President's message was referred to a select committee,  of which John C. Calhoun was chairman. The chairman's report was against  the adoption of the President's recommendation because a subject of  such vital interest to the States ought not to be left to Congress.  The admission of the right of Congress to decide what is incendiary,  asserted the report, carries with it the power to decide what is  not incendiary and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#9)"],[1,"trong; when he is serious, he is like Samson in a wig. Call him a  legislator, a reasoner, and the conductor of the affairs of a great  nation, and it seems to me as absurd as if a butterfly were to teach  bees to make honey. That he was an extraordinary writer of small poetry,  and a diner-out of the highest lustre, I do most readily admit. After  George Selwyn, and perhaps Tickell, there has been no such man for the  last half-century.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE AUTHORSHIP OF \"WAVERLEY.\"      Mrs. Murray Keith, a venerable Scotch lady, from whom Sir Walter Scott  derived many of the traditionary stories and anecdotes wrought up in  his novels, taxed him one day with the authorship, which he, as usual,  stoutly denied. \"What!\" exclaimed the old lady, \"d'ye think I dinna ken  my ain groats among other folk's kail?\"           *       *       *       *       *      QUID PRO QUO.    Campbell relates:--\"Turner, the painter, is a ready wit. Once at a  dinner where several artists, amateurs, and literary men were convened,  a poet, by way of being facetious, proposed as a toast the health of the  _painters_ and _glaziers_ of Great Britain. The toast was drunk; and  Turner, after returning thanks for it, proposed the health of the  British _paper-stainers_.\"           *       *       *       *       *      HOPE'S \"ANASTASIUS.\"    Lord Byron, in a conversation with the Countess of Blessington, said  that he wept bitterly over many pages of _Anastasius_, and for two  reasons: first, that _he_ had not written it; and secondly, that _Hope_  had; for it was necessary to like a man excessively to pardon his  writing such a book; as, he said, excelling all recent productions, as  much in wit and talent as in true pathos. Lord Byron added, that he  would have given his two most approved poems to have been the author of  _Anastasius_.           *       *       *       *       *      SMART REPARTEE.    Walpole relates, after an execution of _eighteen_ malefactors, a woman  was hawking an account of them, but called them _nineteen_. A gentleman  said to her, \"Why do you say _nineteen_? there were but _eighteen_  hanged.\" She replied, \"Sir, I did not know _you_ had been reprieved.\"           *       *       *       *       *      COLTON'S \"LACON.\"    This remarkable book was written upon covers of letters and scraps  of paper of such description as was nearest at hand; the greater  part at a house in Princes-street, Soho. Colton's lodging was a  penuriously-furnished second-floor, and upon a rough deal table,  with a stumpy pen, our author wrote.    Though a beneficed clergyman, holding the vicarage of Kew, with  Petersham, in Surrey, Colton was a well-known frequenter of the  gaming-table; and, suddenly disappearing from his usual haunts in  London about the time of the murder of Weare, in 1823, it was strongly  suspected he had been assassinated. It was, however, afterwards  ascertained that he had absconded to avoid his creditors; and in 1828  a successor was appointed to his living. He then went to reside in  America, but subsequently lived in Paris, a professed gamester; and it  is said that he thus gained, in two years only, the sum of 25,000_l_. He  blew out his brains while on a visit to a friend at Fontainebleau, in  1832; bankrupt in health, spirits, and fortune.           *       *       *       *       *      BUNYAN'S COPY OF \"THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.\"    There is no book, except the Bible, which Bunyan is known to have  perused so intently as the _Acts and Monuments_ of John Fox, the  martyrologist, one of the best of men; a work more hastily than  judiciously compiled, but invaluable for that greater and far more  important portion which has obtained for it its popular name of _The  Book of Martyrs_. Bunyan's own copy of this work is in existence, and  valued of course as such a relic of such a man ought to be. It was  purchased in the year 1780, by Mr. Wantner, of the Minories; from him it  descended to his daughter, Mrs. Parnell, of Botolph-lane; and it was  afterwards purchased, by subscription, for the Bedfordshire General  Library.    This edition of _The Acts and Monuments_ is of the date 1641, 3 vols,  folio, the last of those in the black-letter, and probably the latest  when it came into Bunyan's hands. In each volume he has written his name  beneath the title-page, in a large and stout print-hand. Under some of  the woodcuts he has inserted a few rhymes, which are undoubtedly his own  composition; and which, though much in the manner of the verses that  were printed under the illustrations of his own _Pilgrim's Progress_,  when that work was first adorned with cuts, (verses worthy of such  embellishments,) are very much worse than even the worst of those.  Indeed, it would not be possible to find specimens of more miserable  doggerel.    Here is one of the Tinker's tetrasticks, penned in the margin, beside  the account of Gardiner's death:--     \"The blood, the blood that he did shed    Is falling one his one head;    And dredfull it is for to see    The beginers of his misere.\"    One of the signatures bears the date of 1662; but the verses must  undoubtedly have been some years earlier, before the publication of his  first tract. These curious inscriptions must have been Bunyan's first  attempts in verse: he had, no doubt, found difficulty enough in tinkering  them to make him proud of his work when it was done; otherwise, he would  not have written them in a book which was the most valuable of all his  goods and chattels. In later days, he seems to have taken this book for  his art of poetry. His verses are something below the pitch of Sternhold  and Hopkins. But if he learnt there to make bad verses, he entered fully  into the spirit of its better parts, and received that spirit into as  resolute a heart as ever beat in a martyr's bosom.[2]     [2] Southey's Life of John Bunyan.           *       *       *       *       *      LITERARY LOCALITIES.    Leigh Hunt pleasantly says:--\"I can no more pass through Westminster,  without thinking of Milton; or the Borough, without thinking of Chaucer  and Shakspeare; or Gray's Inn, without calling Bacon to mind; or  Bloomsbury-square, without Steele and Akenside; than I can prefer  brick and mortar to wit and poetry, or not see a beauty upon it beyond  architecture in the splendour of the recollection. I once had duties to  perform which kept me out late at night, and severely taxed my health  and spirits. My path lay through a neighbourhood in which Dryden lived,  and though nothing could be more common-place, and I used to be tired to  the heart and soul of me, I never hesitated to go a little out of the  way, purely that I might pass through Gerard-street, and so give myself  the shadow of a pleasant thought.\"           *       *       *       *       *      CREED OF LORD BOLINGBROKE.    Lord Brougham says:--\"The dreadful malady under which Bolingbroke  long lingered, and at length sunk--a cancer in the face--he bore with  exemplary fortitude, a fortitude drawn from the natural resources of  his vigorous mind, and unhappily not aided by the consolations of any  religion; for, having early cast off the belief in revelation, he had  substituted in its stead a dark and gloomy naturalism, which even  rejected those glimmerings of hope as to futurity not untasted by the  wiser of the heathens.\"    Lord Chesterfield, in one of his letters, which has been published by  Earl Stanhope, says that Bolingbroke only doubted, and by no means  rejected, a future state.           *       *       *       *       *      BUNYAN'S PREACHING.    It is said that Owen, the divine, greatly admired Bunyan's preaching;  and that, being asked by Charles II. \"how a learned man such as he could  sit and listen to an itinerant tinker?\" he replied: \"May it please your  Majesty, could I possess that tinker's abilities for preaching, I would  most gladly relinquish all my learning.\"           *       *       *       *       *      HONE'S \"EVERY-DAY BOOK.\"    This popular work was commenced by its author after he had renounced  political satire for the more peaceful study of the antiquities of our  country. The publication was issued in weekly sheets, and extended  through two years, 1824 and 1825. It was very successful, the weekly  sale being from 20,000 to 30,000 copies.    In 1830, Mr. Southey gave the following tribute to the merits of the  work, which it is pleasurable to record; as these two writers, from  their antipodean politics, had not been accustomed to regard each  other's productions with any favour. In closing his _Life of John  Bunyan_, Mr. Southey says:--    \"In one of the volumes, collected from various quarters, which were sent  to me for this purpose, I observe the name of William Hone, and notice  it that I may take the opportunity of recommending his _Every-day Book  and Table Book_ to those who are interested in the preservation of  our national and local customs. By these curious publications, their  compiler has rendered good service in an important department of  literature; and he may render yet more, if he obtain the encouragement  which he well deserves.\"           *       *       *       *       *      BUNYAN'S ESCAPES.    Bunyan had some providential escapes during his early life. Once, he  fell into a creek of the sea, once out of a boat into the river Ouse,  near Bedford, and each time he was narrowly saved from drowning. One  day, an adder crossed his path. He stunned it with a stick, then forced  open its mouth with a stick and plucked out the tongue, which he supposed  to be the sting, with his fingers; \"by which act,\" he says, \"had not God  been merciful unto me, I might, by my desperateness, have brought myself  to an end.\" If this, indeed, were an adder, and not a harmless snake,  his escape from the fangs was more remarkable than he himself was aware  of. A circumstance, which was likely to impress him more deeply, occurred"]]]
