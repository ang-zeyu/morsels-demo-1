[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#9)"],[1,"ss. All  Europe knows that the British minister has endeavored to frustrate  the negotiations at Luneville. In vain was it declared to him  that France was ready to enter into a separate negotiation. This  declaration only produced a refusal under the pretext that England  could not abandon her ally. Since then, when that ally consented to  treat without England, that government sought other means to delay  a peace so necessary to the world. It raises pretensions contrary  to the dignity and rights of all nations. The whole commerce of  Asia, and of immense colonies, does not satisfy its ambition. All  the seas must submit to the exclusive sovereignty of England.\"  As William Pitt received the tidings of this discomfiture of his  allies, in despairing despondency, he exclaimed, \"Fold up the map  of Europe. In need not again be opened for twenty years.\"    While these great affairs were in progress, Napoleon, in Paris, was  consecrating his energies with almost miraculous power, in developing  all the resources of the majestic empire under his control. He  possessed the power of abstraction to a degree which has probably  never been equaled. He could concentrate all his attention for  any length of time upon one subject, and then, laying that aside  entirely, without expending any energies in unavailing anxiety,  could turn to another, with all the freshness and the vigor of an  unpreoccupied mind. Incessant mental labor was the luxury of his  life. \"Occupation,\" said he, \"is my element. I am born and made for  it. I have found the limits beyond which I could not use my legs.  I have seen the extent to which I could use my eyes. But I have  never known any bounds to my capacity for application.\"    The universality of Napoleon's genius was now most conspicuous. The  revenues of the nation were replenished, and all the taxes arranged  to the satisfaction of the people. The Bank of France was reorganized,  and new energy infused into its operations. Several millions of  dollars were expended in constructing and perfecting five magnificent  roads radiating from Paris to the frontiers of the empire. Robbers,  the vagabonds of disbanded armies, infested the roads, rendering  traveling dangerous in the extreme. \"Be patient,\" said Napoleon.  \"Give me a month or two. I must first conquer peace abroad. I will  then do speedy and complete justice upon these highwaymen.\" A very  important canal, connecting Belgium with France, had been commenced  some years before. The engineers could not agree respecting the  best direction of the cutting through the highlands which separated  the valley of the Oise from that of the Somme. He visited the spot  in person: decided the question promptly, and decided it wisely,  and the canal was pressed to its completion. He immediately caused  three new bridges to be thrown across the Seine at Paris. He  commenced the magnificent road of the Simplon, crossing the rugged  Alps with a broad and smooth highway, which for ages will remain a  durable monument of the genius and energy of Napoleon. In gratitude for  the favors he had received from the monks of the Great St. Bernard,  he founded two similar establishments for the aid of travelers,  one on Mount Cenis, the other on the Simplon, and both auxiliary  to the convent on the Great St. Bernard. Concurrently with these  majestic undertakings, he commenced the compilation of the civil  code of France. The ablest lawyers of Europe were summoned to this  enterprise, and the whole work was discussed section by section  in the Council of State, over which Napoleon presided. The lawyers  were amazed to find that the First Consul was as perfectly familiar  with all the details of legal and political science, as he was with  military strategy.    Bourrienne mentions, that one day, a letter was received from an  emigrant, General Durosel, who had taken refuge in the island of  Jersey. The following is an extract from the letter:    \"You can not have forgotten, general, that when your late father  was obliged to take your brothers from the college of Autun, he was  unprovided with money, and asked of me one hundred and twenty-five  dollars, which I lent him with pleasure. After his return, he had  not an opportunity of paying me, and when I left Ajaccio, your  mother offered to dispose of some plate, in order to pay the debt.  To this I objected, and told her that I would wait until she could  pay me at her convenience. Previous to the Revolution, I believe  that it was not in her power to fulfill her wish of discharging the  debt. I am sorry to be obliged to trouble you about such a trifle.  But such is my unfortunate situation, that even this trifle is of  some importance to me. At the age of eighty-six, general, after  having served my country for sixty years, I am compelled to take  refuge here, and to subsist on a scanty allowance, granted by the  English government to French emigrants. I say emigrants , for I am  obliged to be one against my will.\"    Upon hearing this letter read, Napoleon immediately and warmly  said, \"Bourrienne, this is sacred. Do not lose a moment. Send the  old man ten times the sum. Write to General Durosel, that he shall  immediately be erased from the list of emigrants. What mischief  those brigands of the Convention have done. I can never repair it  all.\" Napoleon uttered these words with a degree of emotion which  he had rarely before evinced. In the evening he inquired, with much  interest of Bourrienne, if he had executed his orders.    Many attempts were made at this time to assassinate the First Consul.  Though France, with the most unparalleled unanimity surrounded him  with admiration, gratitude, and homage, there were violent men in  the two extremes of society, among the Jacobins and the inexorable  Royalists, who regarded him as in their way. Napoleon's escape from  the explosion of the infernal machine, got up by the Royalists,  was almost miraculous.    On the evening of the 24th of December, Napoleon was going to the  Opera, to hear Haydn's Oratorio of the Creation, which was to be  performed for the first time. Intensely occupied by business, he was  reluctant to go; but to gratify Josephine, yielded to her urgent  request. It was necessary for his carriage to pass through a narrow  street. A cart, apparently by accident overturned, obstructed the  passage. A barrel suspended beneath the cart, contained as deadly  a machine as could be constructed with gun-powder and all the  missiles of death. The coachman succeeded in forcing his way by  the cart. He had barely passed when an explosion took place, which  was all over Paris, and which seemed to shake the city to its  foundations. Eight persons were instantly killed, and more than sixty  were wounded, of whom about twenty subsequently died. The houses  for a long distance, on each side of the street, were fearfully  shattered, and many of them were nearly blown to pieces. The  carriage rocked as upon the billows of the sea, and the windows  were shattered to fragments. Napoleon had been in too many scenes  of terror to be alarmed by any noise or destruction which gunpowder  could produce. \"Ha!\" said he, with perfect composure; \"we are blown  up.\" One of his companions in the carriage, greatly terrified,  thrust his head through the demolished window, and called loudly  to the driver to stop. \"No, no!\" said Napoleon; \"drive on.\" When  the First Consul entered the Opera House, he appeared perfectly  calm and unmoved. The greatest consternation, however, prevailed  in all parts of the house, for the explosion had been heard, and  the most fearful apprehensions were felt for the safety of the  idolized Napoleon. As soon as he appeared, thunders of applause,  which shook the very walls of the theatre, gave affecting testimony  of the attachment of the people to his person. In a few moments,  Josephine, who had come in her private carriage, entered the box.  Napoleon turned to her with perfect tranquillity, and said, \"The  rascals tried to blow me up. Where is the book of the Oratorio?\"    Napoleon soon left the Opera and returned to the Tuileries. He  found a vast crowd assembled there, attracted by affection for his  person, and anxiety for his safety. The atrocity of this attempt  excited universal horror, and only increased the already almost  boundless popularity of the First Consul. Deputations and addresses  were immediately poured in upon him from Paris and from all the  departments of France, congratulating him upon his escape. It was  at first thought that this conspiracy was the work of the Jacobins.  There were in Paris more than a hundred of the leaders of the  execrable party, who had obtained a sanguinary notoriety during  the reign of terror. They were active members of a Jacolin Club,  a violent and vulgar gathering continually plotting the overthrow  of the government, and the assassination of the First Consul. They  were thoroughly detested by the people, and the community was glad  to avail itself of any plausible pretext for banishing them from  France. Without sufficient evidence that they were actually guilty  of this particular outrage, in the strong excitement and indignation  of the moment a decree was passed by the legislative bodies, sending  one hundred and sixty of these bloodstained culprits into exile.  The wish was earnestly expressed that Napoleon would promptly punish  them by his own dictatorial power. Napoleon had, in fact, acquired  such unbounded popularity, and the nation was so thoroughly impressed  with a sense of his justice, and his wisdom, the whatever he said  was done. He, however, insisted that the business should be conducted  by the constituted tribunals and under the regular forms of law.  \"The responsibility of this measure,\" said Napoleon, \"must rest  with the legislative body. The consuls are irresponsible. But  the ministers are not. Any one of them who should sign an arbitrary  decree, might hereafter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#9)"],[1," the coast, see the airship put  together again, and start for the interior.\"    \"So am I,\" declared Tom, as he got out his electric rifle, and began  to put it together, for he wanted to show Mr. Anderson how it  worked.    They had a pleasant and uneventful voyage for two weeks. The weather  was good, and, to tell the truth, it was rather monotonous for Tom  and the others, who were eager to get into activity again. Then came  a storm, which, while it was not dangerous, yet gave them plenty to  think and talk about for three days. Then came more calm weather,  when the Soudalar plowed along over gently heaving billows.    They were about a week from their port of destination, which was  Majumba, on the African coast, when, one afternoon, as Tom and the  others were in their cabin, they heard a series of shouts on deck,  and the sound of many feet running to and fro.    \"Something has happened!\" exclaimed the young inventor.    Tom raced for the companionway, and was soon on deck, followed by  Mr. Durban and the others. They saw a crowd of sailors and  passengers leaning over the port rail.    \"What's the matter?\" asked Tom, of the second mate, who was just  passing.    \"Fight between a killer and a whale,\" was the reply. \"The captain  has ordered the ship to lay-to so it can be watched.\"    Tom made his way to the rail. About a quarter of a mile away there  could be observed a great commotion in the ocean. Great bodies  seemed to be threshing about, beating the water to foam, and, with  the foam could be seen bright blood mingled. Occasionally two jets  of water, as from some small fountain, would shoot upward.    \"He's blowing hard!\" exclaimed one of the sailors. \"I guess he's  about done for!\"    \"Which one?\" asked Tom.    \"The whale,\" was the reply. \"The killer has the best of the big  fellow,\" and the sailor quickly explained how the smaller killer  fish, by the peculiarity of its attack, and its great ferocity,  often bested its larger antagonist.    The battle was now at its height, and Tom and the others were  interested spectators. At times neither of the big creatures could  be seen, because of the smother of foam in which they rolled and  threshed about. The whale endeavored to sound, or go to the bottom,  but the killer stuck to him relentlessly.    Suddenly, however, as Tom looked, the whale, by a stroke of his  broad tail, momentarily stunned his antagonist. Instantly realizing  that he was free the great creature, which was about ninety feet  long, darted away, swimming on the surface of the water, for he  needed to get all the air possible.    Quickly acquiring momentum, the whale came on like a locomotive,  spouting at intervals, the vapor from the blowholes looking not  unlike steam from some submarine boat.    \"He looks to be heading this way,\" remarked Mr. Durban to Tom.    \"He is,\" agreed the young inventor, \"but I guess he'll dive before  he gets here. He only wants to get away from the killer. Look, the  other one is swimming this way, too!\"    \"Bless my harpoon, but he sure is!\" called Mr. Damon. \"They'll renew  the fight near here.\"    But he was mistaken, for the killer, after coming a little distance  after the whale, suddenly turned, hesitated for a moment, and then  disappeared in the depths of the ocean.    The whale, however, continued to come on, speeding through the water  with powerful strokes. There was an uneasy movement among some of  the passengers.    \"Suppose he strikes the ship,\" suggested one woman.    \"Nonsense! He couldn't,\" said her husband.    \"The old man had better get under way, just the same,\" remarked a  sailor near Tom, as he looked up at the bridge where the captain was  standing.    The \"old man,\" or commander, evidently thought the same thing, for,  after a glance at the oncoming leviathan, which was still headed  directly for the vessel, he shoved the lever of the telegraph signal  over to \"full speed ahead.\"    Hardly had he done so than the whale sank from sight.    \"Oh, I'm so glad!\" exclaimed the woman who had first spoken of the  possibility of the whale hitting the ship, \"I am afraid of those  terrible creatures.\"    \"They're as harmless as a cow, unless they get angry,\" said her  husband.    Slowly the great ship began to move through the water. Tom and his  friends were about to go back to their cabin, for they thought the  excitement over, when, as the young inventor turned from the rail,  he felt a vibration throughout the whole length of the steamer, as  if it had hit on a sand-bar.    Instantly there was a jangling of bells in the engine room, and the  Soudalar lost headway.    \"What's the matter?\" asked several persons.    They were answered a moment later, for the big whale, even though  grievously wounded in his fight with the killer, had risen not a  hundred feet away from the ship, and was coming toward it with the  speed of an express train.    \"Bless my blubber!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"We must have hit the whale, or  it hit us under the water and now it's going to attack us!\"    He had no more than gotten the words out of his mouth ere the great  creature of the deep came on full tilt at the vessel, struck it a  terrific blow which made it tremble from stem to stern, and careen  violently.    There was a chorus of frightened cries, sailors rushed to and fro,  the engine-room bells rang violently, and the captain and mates  shouted hoarse orders.    \"Here he comes again!\" yelled Mr. Durban, as he hurried to the side  of the ship. \"The whale takes us for an enemy, I guess, and he's  going to ram us again!\"    \"And if he does it many times, he'll start the plates and cause a  leak that won't be stopped in a hurry!\" cried a sailor as he rushed  past Tom.    The young inventor looked at the oncoming monster for a moment, and  then started on the run for his cabin.    \"Here! Where are you going?\" cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not  answer.          CHAPTER X    OFF IN THE AIRSHIP      As Tom Swift hurried down the companionway he again felt the ship  careen as the whale struck it a powerful blow, and he was almost  knocked off his feet. But he kept on.    Below he found some frightened men and women, a number of whom were  adjusting life preservers about them, under the impression that the  ship had struck a rock and was going down. They had not been up on  deck, and did not know of the battle between the killer and the  whale, nor what followed.    \"Oh, I know we're sinking!\" cried one timid woman. \"What has  happened?\" she appealed to Tom.    \"It will be all right in a little while,\" he assured her.    \"But what is it? I want to know. Have we had a collision.\"    \"Yes, with a whale,\" replied Tom, as he grabbed up something from  his stateroom, and again rushed up on deck. As he reached it the  whale came on once more, and struck the ship another terrific blow.  Then the monster sank and could be seen swimming back, just under  the surface of the water, getting ready to renew the attack.    \"He's going to ram us again!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my machine  oil! Why doesn't the captain do something?\"    At that moment the commander cried from the bridge:    \"Send a man below, Mr. Laster, to see if we are making any water.  Then tell half a dozen of the sailors to get out the rifles, and see  if they can't kill the beast. He'll put us in Davy Jones's locker if  he keeps this up! Lively now, men!\"    The first mate, Mr. Laster, called out the order. A sailor went  below to see if the ship was leaking much, and the captain rang for  full speed ahead. But the Soudalar was slow in getting under way  again, and, even at top speed she was no match for the whale, which  was again rushing toward the vessel.    \"Quick with those rifles!\" cried the captain. \"Fire a volley into  the beast!\"    \"There's no need!\" suddenly called Mr. Damon, who had caught sight  of Tom Swift, and the object which the lad carried.    \"No need?\" demanded the commander. \"Why, has the whale sunk, or made  off?\"    \"No,\" answered the eccentric man, \"the whale is still coming on, but  Tom Swift will fix him. Get there, Tom, and let him have a good  one!\"    \"What sort of a gun is that?\" demanded the commander as the young  inventor took his place at the rail, which was now almost deserted.    Tom did not answer. Bracing himself against the rolling and heaving  of the vessel, which was now under about half speed, Tom aimed his  electric rifle at the oncoming leviathan. He looked at the automatic  gage, noted the distance and waiting a moment until the crest of a  wave in front of the whale had subsided, he pressed the button.    If those watching him expected to hear a loud report, and see a  flash of flame, they were disappointed. There was absolutely no  sound, but what happened to the whale was most surprising.    The great animal stopped short amid a swirl of foam, and the next  instant it seemed to disintegrate. It went all to pieces, just as  had the dummy figure which Tom on one occasion fired at with his  rifle and as had the big packing-cases. The whale appeared to  dissolve, as does a lump of sugar in a cup of hot tea, and, five  seconds after Tom Swift had fired his electric gun, there was not a  sign of the monster save a little blood on the calm sea.    \"What--what happened?\" asked the captain in bewilderment. \"Is--is  that monster gone?\"    \"Completely gone!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Bless my powder horn, Tom, but  I knew you could do it!\"    \"Is that a new kind of whale gun, firing an explosive bullet?\"  inquired the commander, as he came down off the bridge and shook  hands with Tom. \"If it is, I'd like to buy one. We may be rammed  again by another whale.\"    \"This is my new, electric rifle,\" explained the young inventor  modestly, \"and it fires wireless charges of electricity instead of  bullets. I'm sorry I can't let you have it, as it's the only one I  have. But I guess no more whales will ram us. That one was evidently  crazed by the attack of the killer, and doubtless"]]]
