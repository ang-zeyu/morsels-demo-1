The girl evidently was  suffering from loss of sleep; her case was not further  investigated until after a long rest.    The next day Hazel started in by saying, ``It's enough to  convince anybody that I was not in the hospital when Mrs. B. and  I went there and found out that they said I had not been there.  Truthfully I don't know where I was.  If I was not there I must  have been some place or I must have been in a trance.''  The long  stories told in the next few days need not be gone into.  They  contained descriptions of life with her family in several towns  when she was a child, of her graduation from the high school in  Des Moines, and of her experience as a nurse in Cincinnati and  Chicago.  Our cross-examination disclosed that she knew a good  many facts about obstetrics, in which she said she had had  training, and about the cities where she said she had lived.  For  instance, she gave a description of the Cliff House at San  Francisco, the seals on the rocks there, the high school in Des  Moines, and so on.  She also knew about life at army posts.  The  point that made us skeptical was when in mentioning the names of  railroads she placed the wrong towns upon them.  For instance,  she told us her brother worked on the L. S. & M. S. at Kenosha.    Hazel's stories were successfully maintained for several days  until a shrewd detective, who got her to tell some street numbers  in Chicago, ferreted out her family.  She had persistently denied  the existence of any of them in Chicago, and, indeed, stated that  her father and mother had died years previously.  One of the most  convincing things about her was her poise; she displayed an  attitude of sincerity combined with a show of deep surprise when  her word was questioned.  For example, the moment before her  mother was brought in to see her, she was asked what she would  say if anyone asserted that her mother was in the next room.  Her  instantaneous, emphatic response was, ``She would have to rise  out of her grave to be there.''    We soon learned that not a single detail the girl had given about  her family was true.  She was born and brought up in Chicago and  had never been outside of the city.  She had never studied  nursing nor had she ever nursed anybody.  In public school she  had reached eighth grade.    Hazel came of an intelligent family and we were able to get a  good account of the family and developmental history.  Heredity  seems completely negative as far as any nervous or mental  abnormalities are concerned.  She is one of seven children, four  of whom are living, three having died in infancy.  The father had  just recently died of tuberculosis.  There has been no trouble  with the other children of any significance for us.  Pregnancy  with Hazel was healthy, but the mother suffered a considerable  shock when she stood on a passenger boat by the side of a man who  jumped overboard and committed suicide.  The birth was difficult.  The child weighed 12 lbs.  Instruments were used; it was a breech  presentation.  At 2 years of age Hazel was very ill with  gastritis and what was said to be spinal meningitis.  She had  some convulsions then.  Had both walked and talked when she was  about 16 months of age.  During childhood she had a severe  strabismus and at 8 years of age was operated upon for it.  Vision has always been practically nil in one eye.  Several  diseases of childhood she had in mild form.  After she was 2  years of age she had no more convulsions, or spasms, or attacks  of any kind.  From the standpoint of general nervousness Hazel  was said to be one of the calmest in the family, although she was  accustomed to drink five or six cups of coffee a day.  Menstruation at 13 years, no irregularity.    On examination we found a very well nourished and well developed  young woman of slouchy attitude and normal expression.  Vision  very defective in one eye and 10/20, even with glasses, in the  other.  Slight strabismus.  General strength good.  Examination  otherwise negative except for the fact that she had been infected  with the diplococcus of Neisser.    Mental tests proved her to have quite normal ability.  Neither  special ability nor disabilities of significance were discovered.  For present discussion it is of interest to note that in the  ``Aussage'' Test she gave a functional account, enumerating 16  items, 2 of which were incorrect, and accepted none of the  suggestions which were offered.    The mother and sister brought out the facts that Hazel had been  giving an assumed name recently and lying about her age.  She had  alleged that she was married.  In the last year she had run away  from home on several occasions.  At one time had written to her  mother about her happy married life.  One letter reads, ``Dearest  Mother:--I can picture your dear face when you receive my letter.  I know you have your doubts about the matter, the same as I had  the first few days.  But mama, you know I love him and I have the  satisfaction of being a married woman before Annie is.''  In the  letter she describes the appearance of her imaginary husband,  tells about her new dress and gloves and ``the prettiest little  wedding ring that was ever made.''  In another letter she says,  ``It is just one o'clock A.M. and Jack has just gone to sleep and  so I stole a little time to write,'' etc.  (It was later shown by  the stationery used, and by the girl's final confession, that  these letters were written in the rest room of a department  store.)    Hazel's lying began, it seems, when she was a little girl.  She  would come home from school and out of whole cloth relate  incidents which occurred on the way home.  One of her earliest  efforts was about being chased by a white horse.  The mother  states that for years she has had to check Hazel because she  recognized her remarkable tendencies in this direction.  The  father's death was somewhat of a shock and it seems that after  this the girl's other delinquencies began.  Prior to the time she  first went away from home she had some sort of hysterical spells  when she said she could see her father lying in his coffin before  her in the room.  Her behavior became quite outrageous with some  young man in her own household at just about this time.  Not that  she was immoral, although she once suddenly blurted out in the  parlor a grave self-accusation:  ``Now, John, mother thinks you  must be careful.  You know I am a prostitute.''  When we first  saw her she had been away from home four times, on this last  occasion for three weeks.  Before she went she had said she  wanted to kill herself.  Mother had notified the police but no  trace of her was found.    From Hazel's own story told at this time and even after she  became more stable it seems very likely that her bad tendencies  began with her acquaintance with a certain rather notorious  woman.  Her mother came to believe that this was undoubtedly the  fact.  Our inquiry into beginnings brought to light the fact that  Hazel while a school girl for long associated with this woman who  taught her about sex immoralities.  ``I don't believe my mother  knows what this Mrs. R. did to me or she would have her arrested.  She started me on all this.  When I was about 11 years old I  first knew of those things.  The first I ever heard was from that  woman's daughter.  I never said anything to my mother.  I was  always ashamed of myself to say anything about it.  After I got  to working with factory girls I heard a lot about it.''  The  mother told us later that she thought it probable from what she  now knew that this Mrs. R. may have been largely responsible for  Hazel's tendency to delinquency.  Hazel kept this association of  several years' standing quite to herself.  The mother remembers  now how Hazel once stayed for hours after school and told a story  in explanation that they felt sure was untrue.  The teachers used  to tell the mother that Hazel seemed as if she couldn't pay  attention to her school work.  One teacher reported to us that  she remembers Hazel as a girl who seemed peculiar and hysterical.  The other girls called her queer and used to steer clear of her.    The mother reports Hazel as being for several years impulsive,  erratic, talkative, untidy, and rather dishonest in other small  ways besides lying--all this in spite of vigorous home  discipline.  The girl at one time under the influence of revival  meetings left the religious faith of her parents.  However, they  thought if any form of religion would make her better it would be  all right.    At our last interview with Hazel before she was sent away, an  interview which she prefaced by saying, ``I want to apologize for  everything I did,'' the girl showed herself unable to avoid  prevarications.  Coming back, for instance, to the subject of her  schooling she tells us how she won a graduating medal.  This her  mother said was untrue.    About her own lying tendencies she confessed that sometimes she  hardly knew whether things were really so or not.  Asked about  her knowledge of other cities; ``I read a whole lot and learn  things in that way.  I used to have to write compositions and  imagine we were going places.  I was pretty good at that.''  One  felt very uncertain about Hazel's mental condition when in almost  the same breath she denied having said anything about the seals  on the rocks at San Francisco, or about obstetrical cases, but,  of course, the denial may have been itself another falsification.  Her knowledge of army affairs was gained through her acquaintance  with young soldiers.  An unusual amount of what she heard or read  was photographed with the greatest clearness in her mind and was  recalled most vividly.    A peculiarity of Hazel's case which was quite obvious was her  lack of apperception concerning her own interests.  Her lies all  along, after her identity was discovered, were so easy to trace,  and they so quickly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44941"],[0,"The Government of God (#9)"],[1,"s, regulating their morals, setting them a correct  example, and teaching them correct principles; but more especially  in preserving the _purity_ of his own body. And why? Because, if he  abuses his body, and corrupts himself, he not only injures himself, but  his partner and associates, and entails misery incalculable upon his  posterity, who are doomed to inherit the father's misery; and this is  not only associated with time, but with eternity. Hence the Lord has  given laws regulating marriage and chastity of the strictest kind, and  entailed the severest punishment upon those, who, in different ages  have abused this sacred ordinance. For example, the curse of Sodom and  Gomorrah: and the terrible judgements pronounced against those who  should corrupt and defile their bodies, let any one read Deut. xxii.  13-30. And Paul says, \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and  that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple  of God, him shall God destroy.\" 1 Cor. iii. 16, 17. Whoremongers and  adulterers shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 1 Cor. vi. 9,  10; and Heb. xiii. 4. And why? Because man being made a free agent over  his own body, that he might exalt himself and posterity, both in time  and in eternity, if he abuses that power, he not only affects himself,  but unborn bodies and spirits, corrupting the world, and opening the  flood gates of vice, immorality, and estrangement from God. Hence the  children of Israel were told not to marry with the surrounding nations,  lest their seed should be corrupted, and the people turned to idolatry,  which would lead to the forgetfulness of God, to an ignorance of his  purposes and designs, and cause them to lose sight of the object of  their creation, and corrupt themselves; and to the introduction of  every other evil, as a natural consequence. But where the order of God  is carried out, it places things in a lovely position.    What is more amiable and pleasant than those pure, innocent, endearing  affections which God has placed in the hearts of the man and woman, who  are united together in lawful matrimony? With a love and confidence  pure as the love of God, because it springs from him, and is his gift;  with bodies chaste, and virtuous; and an offspring, lovely, healthy,  innocent, and uncontaminated; confiding in each other, they live  together in the fear of God, enjoying nature's gifts uncorrupted and  undefiled as the driven snow, or the crystal stream. But how would this  enjoyment be enhanced, if they understood their destiny; could unravel  the designs of God, and contemplate an eternal union, in another state  of existence; a connexion with their offspring, commenced here to  endure for ever, and all their ties, relationships, and affections  strengthened! A mother feels great delight in beholding her child,  and gazing on its lovely infant form. How would her bosom swell with  ecstacy at the contemplation of that child being with her for ever!  And if we only understood our position, this was the object for which  we came into the world. And the object of the kingdom of God is, to  re-establish all those holy principles.    Chastity and purity are things of the greatest importance to the  world. Hence the Prophet says, \"Because the Lord hath been witness  between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt  treacherously; yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.  And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the Spirit. And  wherefore one? that he might _seek a godly seed_. Therefore take heed  to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his  youth.\" Mal. ii. 14, 15. Here, then, the object of purity is pointed  out clearly; and what is it? that God might preserve a godly seed. St.  Paul says, \"What? know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is  one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.... Flee fornication.  Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth  fornication, sinneth against his own body. What? know ye not that your  body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have  of God, and ye are not your own.\" 1 Cor. vi. 16-20. And in the next  chapter he speaks of the same things which Malachi does concerning a  pure seed. \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife,  and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your  children unclean; _but now are they holy_.\"    The legislators of all civilized nations have seen the necessity of  sustaining these things, and consequently have passed, generally,  very rigid laws for the protection of female virtue, and the support  of the marriage contract. Hence Acts have been passed and enforced,  disinheriting those who were not born in wedlock. This, in some  instances, has produced a salutary effect. Ministers of the various  churches have also used their influence, in a great measure, in support  of virtuous principles. These have had their effect in assisting to  stem the torrent of iniquity. But as the nations themselves have  forsaken God, how can they expect to stop this crying evil; for the  very legislators who pass these laws are in many instances guilty  themselves; and when kings, princes, and rulers, corrupt themselves,  how can they expect the people to be pure? for no matter how rigid  law may be, corrupt persons will always find means to evade it. And,  indeed, so far have these abominations gone, that it seems to be an  admitted fact, that these things cannot be controlled; and, although  there are laws relative to matrimonial alliances, yet there are some  nations, called Christian, who actually give licence for prostitution,  and all the degradation and misery associated with it. Nor are these  things connected with the lower ranks of life only; wantonness and  voluptuousness go hand in hand, and revel unchecked in courts, among  the nobles and kings of the earth. The statesman, the politician,  and the merchant, the mechanic and the labourer, have all corrupted  themselves. The world is full of adultery, intrigues, fornication,  and abominations. Let any one go to the masked balls in the principal  theatres in Paris, and he will see thousands of people of both sexes,  impudently, shamelessly, and unblushingly, manifesting their lewd  dispositions. Indeed, debauch and wantonness bear full sway, not  to speak of the dens of abomination that exist elsewhere. London  abounds with unfortunate beings, led on by example, seduction, and  misery, to their fallen, degraded condition. The same thing exists  throughout England, France, the United States, and all nations. Hence  millions of youth corrupt themselves, engender the most loathsome  diseases, and curse their posterity with their sin, who, in their  turn, rise up and tread in the corrupt steps of their fathers. Not  to say anything of the thousands of lovely beings whom God designed  for companions of man in time and in eternity, and for raising up  a pure offspring, who are corrupted, degraded, polluted, fallen,  poor, miserable wretches; outcasts of society, insulted, oppressed,  despised, and abused; dragging out a miserable existence; led on from  one degree of degradation to another, till death, as a friend, closes  their wretched career, and yet without hope. Thus, man that was made  pure, in the image of his Maker, that could stand proudly erect as the  representative of God, pure, and uncontaminated, is debased, fallen,  corrupt, diseased, and sunk below the brute creation; a creature of  lust and passion, and a slave to his unbridled appetites. I write  plainly on this subject; and I do it because it is a curse to the  world, and God will have a reckoning with the nations for these  things. In vain, then, men legislate on these matters: the nations  have corrupted themselves, and these things are beyond their control.  Men must be governed by higher, and purer motives than merely human  enactments. If the world understood its true position, and the eternal  consequences to them and their seed, they would feel different. They  would feel that they were eternal beings; that they were responsible  to God, both for their bodies and spirits. Nothing but a knowledge of  man's fall and true position, and the development of the kingdom of  God, can restore him to his proper state, restore the order and economy  of God, and place man again in his natural position on the earth.    Having spoken of man as an eternal being, we will now examine what  relation he has to this earth; for it is the government of God that we  wish to keep our minds upon. This earth is man's eternal inheritance,  where he will exist after the resurrection, for it is destined to be  purified and become celestial. I know that this position is considered  strange by many, because it is generally supposed that we are going to  heaven; that heaven is the final destination of the righteous; and that  when we leave this world, we never return. Hence Wesley says--        \"Beyond the bounds of time and space,      Look forward to that heavenly place,      The Saints' secure abode;\"    and this is an opinion generally believed by the Christian world.    We shall therefore commence by enquiring, Where is heaven? Can any one  point out its location? I would remark, that it is a word of almost  unlimited signification; nevertheless we will investigate the matter  a little. We read, that in the beginning \"God created the heavens and  the earth;\" and furthermore, that he called the \"firmament heaven.\"  From the above we learn, that the heavens were created by the Lord,  and that the heavens were created at, or about the same time as the  earth, and that the firmament is called heaven. We are further told  concerning the firmament, that \"God separated the waters that were  below the firmament, from those that were above the firmament.\" Hence,  when God destroyed the world with a flood, \"He opened the"]]]
