Type locality not given, for the  specimen was purchased from a dealer in Hamburg. The type locality was  first restricted to \"Acapulco,\" Guerrero, by Smith (1941:119), then to  Laguna Coyuca, Guerrero, Mexico, by Smith and Taylor (1950:331).    _Diagnosis._--Three or four dorsal dark stripes, each involving two or  more adjacent scale-rows; never having brown or black on the 1st  scale-row; seven supralabials immaculate white or pale tannish-white.    _Variation._--One hundred seventy-one specimens have 149 to 181 (163.7  +- 6.33) ventrals. One hundred fifty-three of these having complete  tails have 55 to 76 (64.8 +- 4.90) subcaudals; the number of ventrals  plus subcaudals varies from 214 to 245 (228.5). In 170 specimens the  reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal scales takes place between ventrals 84  and 118 (102.3 +- 6.60). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the number of  subcaudals; 58 females have 55 to 66 (60.0) and 95 males have 59 to 76  (67.8) subcaudals. The longest specimen (AMNH 68004) is a male from  Escurano, Oaxaca, Mexico, having a body length of 668 mm., a tail  length of 182 mm. and a total length of 850 mm. A juvenile (CNHM  40435) from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico, has a body length of 133 mm.,  a tail length of 31 mm. and a total length of 164 mm.    Variation in coloration is of such magnitude that it has been used as  the basis for recognition of subspecies. Unfortunately, until this  time, most specimens reported upon in the literature represented the  two extremes of variation. After examining the coloration of 174  specimens with respect to geographic distribution, I conclude that  only one highly variable species is represented. Specimens from the  northern and western parts of the range (Michoacan, Colima, and  Durango) have the color pattern of _C. vittatus_ as described by  Peters (1860:518-521); these snakes have four narrow black stripes on  a white or pale tan background, and an immaculate white venter. The  lateral dark stripe, which on the head passes through the eye, is  present on the dorsal half of the 3rd and the ventral half of the 4th  scale-rows; the dorsolateral dark stripe, which passes along the  middle of the head and splits on the nape, is present on the middle of  the 8th scale-row. The other extreme in color pattern consists of  three broad stripes; the two dorsolateral stripes are fused. This  pattern is prevalent in specimens from the area around Tehuantepec,  Oaxaca. The lateral stripes include the dorsal half to two-thirds of  the 2nd, all of the 3rd and 4th, and half of the 5th scale-rows; the  fused dorsolateral stripes sometimes cover all of the area dorsal to  and including the dorsal third of the 7th scale-row.    Snakes from areas between Tehuantepec and the margins of the  distribution of this species are variously intermediate between the  extremes described above. In some snakes from these areas the lateral  stripes are broad and include either the dorsal half of the 2nd  scale-row or the ventral half of the 5th scale-row, but not both on  the same specimen. Also, the dorsolateral stripes are broad and  include most of the 9th and a part of the 10th scale-rows. Many  specimens from the area around Tehuantepec, where the three-striped  pattern is prevalent, have an intermediate pattern. Some have white on  the center of the 10th scale-row or lateral stripes that are not so  broad as to include the 3rd and 4th and half of each of the 2nd and  5th scale-rows.    The supralabials are immaculate white or pale tan, except that in some  specimens the dorsalmost part of some supralabials are dark brown or  black as they are included in the ventral boundary of the dark stripe  that passes through the eye. There are no dusky markings on the chin  or on any of the ventral scales.    There is no ontogenetic change in color pattern; juveniles have the  same coloration as adults from the same geographic area.    Color in life is not greatly different from that of preserved  specimens. One specimen (UMMZ 114483) from 10.8 miles south of Oaxaca,  had in life black stripes, a pale yellowish tan dorsal ground-color  and a pale off-white venter.    An excellent photograph of this species appears in Schmidt and Inger  (1957:230) under the name _Conophis lineatus_.    _Remarks._--I have been unable to find variation of geographic  importance in scutellation in this species. A wide range of variation  in the characters of scutellation is present in specimens from most  localities; it shows no significant clinal or geographic trends. As I  have stated previously, in the discussion of variation, coloration has  been the feature primarily used by previous workers to distinguish two  \"subspecies\" for this species; _C. vittatus vittatus_ having four  black stripes and _C. vittatus viduus_ having three black stripes.  Most of the three-striped snakes occur in the vicinity of Tehuantepec,  Oaxaca, whereas the four-striped snakes are found near the margins of  the range of the species in Durango, Colima, Michoacan, Morelos and  Puebla. Specimens that would have to be considered intergrades between  the \"subspecies\" are found in Michoacan, Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas.  At the time the subspecies were proposed only specimens from  Tehuantepec or from marginal areas were known. Utilizing the large  number of specimens of this species presently available, geographic  variation is found to be clinal, from those with three stripes from  near Tehuantepec, through several intermediate patterns present on  specimens from single localities in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas, to  those with four dark stripes in areas farthest removed to the north  and west from Tehuantepec. Since only coloration shows geographic  variation, and since this variation represents a continuous cline,  subspecies cannot be recognized for this species.    The presence and position of the three or four dark stripes on the  body and the absence of brown on the 1st scale-row or on the ventral  scales, in combination with the generic characters, distinguish  _Conophis vittatus_ from all other Mexican snakes. The only other  snake that occurs in western Mexico that has been confused with _C.  vittatus_ is _Coniophanes piceivittus taylori_, which has 25, instead  of 19, scale-rows.    _Distribution._--Semi-arid habitats on Pacific slopes from extreme  southern Durango southeastward to Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, and  inland in the eastern Balsas Basin to Morelos and western Puebla  (fig. 5).

A day is at hand, a dangerous day for the recluse obliged to  quit its excellent retreat and face the perils of the surface. Eating  is not everything: we have to get out of this. The larva, so  well-equipped with tools and muscular strength, finds no difficulty in  going where it pleases, by boring through the wood; but does the coming  Capricorn, whose short spell of life must be spent in the open air,  possess the same advantages? Hatched inside the trunk, will the  long-horned insect be able to clear itself a way of escape?    That is the difficulty which the worm solves by inspiration. Less  versed in things of the future, despite my gleams of reason, I resort  to experiment with a view to fathoming the question. I begin by  ascertaining that the Capricorn, when he wishes to leave the trunk, is  absolutely unable to make use of the tunnel wrought by the larva. It is  a very long and very irregular maze, blocked with great heaps of wormed  wood. Its diameter decreases progressively from the final blind alley  to the starting-point. The larva entered the timber as slim as a tiny  bit of straw; it is to-day as thick as my finger. In its three years'  wanderings it always dug its gallery according to the mould of its  body. Evidently, the road by which the larva entered and moved about  cannot be the Capricorn's exit-way: his immoderate antennae, his long  legs, his inflexible armour-plates would encounter an insuperable  obstacle in the narrow, winding corridor, which would have to be  cleared of its wormed wood and, moreover, greatly enlarged. It would be  less fatiguing to attack the untouched timber and dig straight ahead.  Is the insect capable of doing so? We shall see.    I make some chambers of suitable size in oak logs chopped in two; and  each of my artificial cells receives a newly transformed Cerambyx, such  as my provisions of firewood supply, when split by the wedge, in  October. The two pieces are then joined and kept together with a few  bands of wire. June comes. I hear a scraping inside my billets. Will  the Capricorns come out, or not? The delivery does not seem difficult  to me: there is hardly three-quarters of an inch to pierce. Not one  emerges. When all is silence, I open my apparatus. The captives, from  first to last, are dead. A vestige of sawdust, less than a pinch of  snuff, represents all their work.    I expected more from those sturdy tools, their mandibles. But, as I  have said elsewhere, the tool does not make the workman. In spite of  their boring-implements, the hermits die in my cases for lack of skill.  I subject others to less arduous tests. I enclose them in spacious  reed-stumps, equal in diameter to the natal cell. The obstacle to be  pierced is the natural diaphragm, a yielding partition two or three  millimetres thick. (.078 to .117 inch.--Translator's Note.) Some free  themselves; others cannot. The less vibrant ones succumb, stopped by  the frail barrier. What would it be if they had to pass through a  thickness of oak?    We are now persuaded: despite his stalwart appearance, the Capricorn is  powerless to leave the tree-trunk by his unaided efforts. It therefore  falls to the worm, to the wisdom of that bit of an intestine, to  prepare the way for him. We see renewed, in another form, the feats of  prowess of the Anthrax, whose pupa, armed with trepans, bores through  rock on the feeble Fly's behalf. Urged by a presentiment that to us  remains an unfathomable mystery, the Cerambyx-grub leaves the inside of  the oak, its peaceful retreat, its unassailable stronghold, to wriggle  towards the outside, where lives the foe, the Woodpecker, who may  gobble up the succulent little sausage. At the risk of its life, it  stubbornly digs and gnaws to the very bark, of which it leaves no more  intact than the thinnest film, a slender screen. Sometimes, even, the  rash one opens the window wide.    This is the Capricorn's exit-hole. The insect will have but to file the  screen a little with its mandibles, to bump against it with its  forehead, in order to bring it down; it will even have nothing to do  when the window is free, as often happens. The unskilled carpenter,  burdened with his extravagant head-dress, will emerge from the darkness  through this opening when the summer heats arrive.    After the cares of the future come the cares of the present. The larva,  which has just opened the aperture of escape, retreats some distance  down its gallery and, in the side of the exit-way, digs itself a  transformation-chamber more sumptuously furnished and barricaded than  any that I have ever seen. It is a roomy niche, shaped like a flattened  ellipsoid, the length of which reaches eighty to a hundred millimetres.  (3 to 4 inches.--Translator's Note.) The two axes of the cross-section  vary: the horizontal measures twenty-five to thirty millimetres (.975  to 1.17 inch.--Translator's Note.); the vertical measures only fifteen.  (.585 inch.--Translator's Note.) This greater dimension of the cell,  where the thickness of the perfect insect is concerned, leaves a  certain scope for the action of its legs when the time comes for  forcing the barricade, which is more than a close-fitting mummy-case  would do.    The barricade in question, a door which the larva builds to exclude the  dangers from without, is two-and even three-fold. Outside, it is a  stack of woody refuse, of particles of chopped timber; inside, a  mineral hatch, a concave cover, all in one piece, of a chalky white.  Pretty often, but not always, there is added to these two layers an  inner casing of shavings. Behind this compound door, the larva makes  its arrangements for the metamorphosis. The sides of the chamber are  rasped, thus providing a sort of down formed of ravelled woody fibres,  broken into minute shreds. The velvety matter, as and when obtained, is  applied to the wall in a continuous felt at least a millimetre thick.  (.039 inch.--Translator's Note.) The chamber is thus padded throughout  with a fine swan's-down, a delicate precaution taken by the rough worm  on behalf of the tender pupa.    Let us hark back to the most curious part of the furnishing, the  mineral hatch or inner door of the entrance. It is an elliptical  skull-cap, white and hard as chalk, smooth within and knotted without,  resembling more or less closely an acorn-cup. The knots show that the  matter is supplied in small, pasty mouthfuls, solidifying outside in  slight projections which the insect does not remove, being unable to  get at them, and polished on the inside surface, which is within the  worm's reach. What can be the nature of that singular lid whereof the  Cerambyx furnishes me with the first specimen? It is as hard and  brittle as a flake of lime-stone. It can be dissolved cold in nitric  acid, discharging little gaseous bubbles. The process of solution is a  slow one, requiring several hours for a tiny fragment. Everything is  dissolved, except a few yellowish flocks, which appear to be of an  organic nature. As a matter of fact, a piece of the hatch, when  subjected to heat, blackens, proving the presence of an organic glue  cementing the mineral matter. The solution becomes muddy if oxalate of  ammonia be added; it then deposits a copious white precipitate. These  signs indicate calcium carbonate. I look for urate of ammonia, that  constantly recurring product of the various stages of the  metamorphoses. It is not there: I find not the least trace of murexide.  The lid, therefore, is composed solely of carbonate of lime and of an  organic cement, no doubt of an albuminous character, which gives  consistency to the chalky paste.    Had circumstances served me better, I should have tried to discover in  which of the worm's organs the stony deposit dwells. I am however,  convinced: it is the stomach, the chylific ventricle, that supplies the  chalk. It keeps it separated from the food, either as original matter  or as a derivative of the ammonium urate; it purges it of all foreign  bodies, when the larval period comes to an end, and holds it in reserve  until the time comes to disgorge it. This freestone factory causes me  no astonishment: when the manufacturer undergoes his change, it serves  for various chemical works. Certain Oil-beetles, such as the Sitaris,  locate in it the urate of ammonia, the refuse of the transformed  organism; the Sphex, the Pelopaei, the Scoliae use it to manufacture  the shellac wherewith the silk of the cocoon is varnished. Further  investigations will only swell the aggregate of the products of this  obliging organ.    When the exit-way is prepared and the cell upholstered in velvet and  closed with a threefold barricade, the industrious worm has concluded  its task. It lays aside its tools, sheds its skin and becomes a nymph,  a pupa, weakness personified, in swaddling-clothes, on a soft couch.  The head is always turned towards the door. This is a trifling detail  in appearance; but it is everything in reality. To lie this way or that  in the long cell is a matter of great indifference to the grub, which  is very supple, turning easily in its narrow lodging and adopting  whatever position it pleases. The coming Capricorn will not enjoy the  same privileges. Stiffly girt in his horn cuirass, he will not be able  to turn from end to end; he will not even be capable of bending, if  some sudden wind should make the passage difficult. He must absolutely  find the door in front of him, lest he perish in the casket. Should the  grub forget this little formality, should it lie down to its nymphal  sleep with its head at the back of the cell, the Capricorn is  infallibly lost: his cradle becomes a hopeless dungeon.    But there is no fear of this danger: the knowledge of our bit of an  intestine is too sound in things of the future for the grub to neglect  the formality of keeping its head to the door. At the end of spring,  the Capricorn, now in possession of his full strength, "]]]
