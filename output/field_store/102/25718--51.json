Thus thought Teresa Nu[~n]a  when the brave and honoured Diego Lainez besought her hand; she gave it  to him with joy, for by doing so the honour of her house would be  increased, and, above all, her noble aspirations would find their  realisation. From that time forward she was, more than ever before, the  mother of the unfortunate; and when nature gave her another right to  that sweet name, when she was called such by the rosy lips of her child,  she considered herself the happiest woman in this world. It is easy,  then, to imagine the love she felt for Rodrigo, she whose heart was a  treasure of love and tenderness for all, and the pleasure she would feel  in again clasping to her heart that handsome and gentle youth after some  months of separation from him. He had scarcely dismounted in the  courtyard of the castle when she ran to meet him, and both were reunited  in a close embrace.    \"How is it, my son,\" asked Teresa of the youth, \"that your father has  not come with you, for had he done so my happiness would be complete?\"    \"Do not be uneasy, dear mother,\" replied Rodrigo; \"last night I left him  well, and much honoured by the king, at Leon, to which city Don Fernando  has returned.\"    \"I am rejoiced, son of my soul, on account of the affection which Don  Fernando feels for your father, and the favours which he confers on him;  however, I would be more rejoiced if I could have him always by my side,  for if the love which I always had for him made me weep during his  absence when he was still vigorous and young, it makes me doubly sad  when he is away from me now that he is feeble and old. I fear that the  disquietudes of a Court life may injure his health, or that he may be  injured by the plots which his rivals and enemies get up against him.\"    \"As to that, have no fear, mother. Our rivals know that, even if the  hand of Diego Lainez is weak to avenge injuries, it is not so with that  of his son. Who will dare to insult Diego, now that a knight's sword has  been girt on Rodrigo?\"    \"Oh, my son!\" exclaimed Teresa, again embracing the youth, full of  delight, as much for the generous impulse which the words of her son  manifested as for the news that he had been made a knight. \"How is it  that the eyes of your mother did not sooner notice your sword-belt?  When, my son, were you so honoured?\"    \"Only yesterday, dear mother, and much honoured indeed, for the king  girt on my sword, the queen gave me my steed, and the Infanta Do[~n]a  Urraca buckled on my spurs.\"    \"Oh, how great an honour you will become to the order into which you  have been received!\"    \"Such, I trust, shall be soon, mother; for I only come to take leave of  you before setting out for the frontiers to fight against the Moorish  power; for oh, my mother, I want riches, I want a throne!\"    \"I well can understand those noble aspirations, as the blood of the  Counts of Castile flows in your veins. Proceed, then, to the war, even  though parting from you will make your mother's heart bleed, as I would  wish to keep you always near me. However, let no ambition dazzle you,  beyond that of serving your country and the faith of your forefathers.  You say that you desire riches, that you desire a throne. Why do you  desire a throne, my son?\"    \"I desire it, dear mother, in order to raise myself above that ambitious  count, who looks on me as one too poor and humble to merit the hand of  his daughter.\"    \"Ah, my son, you have then not yet conquered that love, the realising of  which has become almost an impossibility, and which has caused such  inquietudes both in your soul and in those of your parents? You have not  yet forgotten Ximena?\"    \"Forget her? forget her? Never, my mother! In vain have I tried to do  so; in vain have I sought to erase her image from my heart; in vain have  I tried to think that to love Ximena was almost the same as to humble  myself before her father, a humiliation unworthy of the race of Vivar;  but this love still dominates me, stronger and more vigorous than ever.  Forget her? forget her? Had I but loved her a day, a month, a year, and  not almost during my whole life; were Ximena and I the maiden and the  youth, whose union might appease paternal rancours or satisfy paternal  ambitions, and in which love had little part; were she less beautiful,  less discreet, less honoured than she is--then perhaps I could forget  her; but you, my mother, know how deep is the love which unites us; for  you, whose eyes were ever fixed on us, have seen it spring up and  increase, and you have even fanned its flame by keeping us ever near  each other, and by letting us see the pleasure and the pride which a  similar love caused you. I promised you, indeed, when I left your arms  to betake myself to the Court, that I would endeavour to forget her, and  I even said to you that I had hopes that I might be able to do so; but I  was mistaken, dear mother. Many days passed without my seeing her, but  none that I did not think on her; and that day on which my father  brought me with him to the Court was the happiest of my life, and proved  to me that separation had only made our love stronger. Had you seen her  eclipsing with her beauty that of the fairest dames of Leon, and  receiving the homage of the bravest and best cavaliers, you could not  ask me, mother, Have you forgotten her?\"    Teresa was now convinced, if indeed she had not already been so, that  the love of her son was above all reasonings, and she did not try to  overcome it with hers. She thought it better, therefore, to endeavour to  remove the pain from his burning heart by pouring on it some drops of  the balsam of hope.    \"Do not forget her, then, my son,\" she said to the excited youth,  caressing him with her hand, and with a look full of love and  tenderness. \"This love will elevate your soul and strengthen your heart.  Summon our friends and vassals, and go fight against the infidel, for  the glory and the power which you will achieve shall throw into the  shade, as you have said, the ambitious Don Gome, and Ximena will become  your bride. The contentions which separate her family and ours are not  of that kind which, between honourable rivals, cannot be terminated  without honour being stained. Go, my Rodrigo, go to your repose, for  indeed you require it after so long a journey, and to-morrow we shall  see what can be done to promote your happiness; for your mother, more  experienced than you in the affairs of this world, will aid you with her  love and advice.\"    Teresa and her son again lovingly embraced each other, and the youth  retired to take off his armour in order to seek repose; not, however,  without having related to her the adventure at the Inn of the Moor, and  having recommended to her care the maiden who had sought the hospitality  of the castle.    Having described the reception which was given to Rodrigo at Vivar, we  must also describe that which Fernan received.    Almost at the same time that our travellers rode into the courtyard of  the castle, there entered after them a large number of girls and young  men, vassals of the grandee of Vivar, who, having seen Rodrigo arrive,  and having recognised, by his armour, that he was now a knight, came to  welcome him and offer him their congratulations on account of the order  of chivalry which he had received, playing rustic instruments and  singing joyous songs. As soon as Rodrigo dismounted he ascended to the  upper apartments, leaving the young girl, his guest, with his squire, in  order that he might place her under the care of the servants of his  mother, as we have already mentioned. Fernan then proceeded to the  stables, to see that the horses were properly attended to. When he  returned to the courtyard the male and female peasants began to pour in,  and amongst the latter he saw one so graceful and pretty that he would  have fallen in love with her at once, if his heart had not been captured  beforehand, by her charms. As it was a long time since he had seen her,  he forgot where he was, and running up to her, gave her a warm embrace,  which the girl did not try to avoid, as she was rather fond of the brave  squire, and love, particularly amongst country-people, often goes beyond  the bounds of decorum. At that very moment Mayorica heard the music and  the cheering in the courtyard; she ran to her window, which looked out  on it, and was much enraged, with good cause, when she saw Fernan so  warmly embracing the peasant girl. \"Ah, traitor!\" she exclaimed; and  when he heard that cry, the squire let go the girl, who, uttering  another cry, suddenly ran off from her companions and from the castle,  not without threatening both with her look and hand the unlucky Fernan,  who did not notice this, however, on account of the perturbation of his  mind.    The good squire remained as if thunderstruck for some moments, but he  soon recovered his habitual serenity, and began to consider, whilst  ascending the stairs, what he should do to escape the strong language  and, perhaps, the nails of Mayorica.    \"What a fool I am,\" he said to himself, \"not to be able to restrain my  impetuous feelings, when prudence should counsel me to do so!\" and he  tugged at his hair out of pure vexation with himself. \"A fool, and ten  times a fool,\" he continued, \"not to remember the unreasonableness of  women. O ye women, cause of all my troubles! but it was I myself, donkey  that I am, that was the cause of the present one. Why do I not cast both  of you off, or turn Moor, so as to have three, and none of them to tear  my beard if I love the others.

Utterson sighed. \"Is there never  anything else?\" he asked.    Poole nodded. \"Once,\" he said. \"Once I heard it weeping!\"    \"Weeping? how that?\" said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill  of horror.    \"Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,\" said    63)    the butler. \"I came away with that upon my heart, that I could  have wept too.\"    But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe  from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the  nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near  with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up  and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night.    \"Jekyll,\" cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \"I demand to see  you.\" He paused a moment, but there came no reply. \"I give you  fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall  see you,\" he resumed; \"if not by fair means, then by foul! if not  of your consent, then by brute force!\"    \"Utterson,\" said the voice, \"for God's sake, have mercy!\"      \"Ah, that's not Jekyll's voice--it's Hyde's!\" cried Utterson.  \"Down with the door, Poole!\"    Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the  building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and  hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the  cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and  the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was  tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was  not until the fifth, that the lock burst in sunder and the wreck  of the door fell inwards on the carpet.    64)      The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that  had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the  cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire  glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin  strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the  business-table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea:  the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glazed  presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in  London.    Right in the midst there lay the body of a man sorely contorted  and still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its  back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in  clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor's bigness;  the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but  life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the  strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew  that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.    \"We have come too late,\" he said sternly, \"whether to save or  punish. Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us  to find the body of your master.\"    The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the  theatre, which filled almost the whole ground story and was  lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper  story at one end and looked upon the    65)    court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the  by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a  second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets  and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined.  Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by  the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The  cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from  the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll's predecessor; but even  as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness  of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which  had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace  of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.    Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \"He must be buried  here,\" he said, hearkening to the sound.    \"Or he may have fled,\" said Utterson, and he turned to examine  the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on  the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.    \"This does not look like use,\" observed the lawyer.    \"Use!\" echoed Poole. \"Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as  if a man had stamped on it.\"    \"Ay,\" continued Utterson, \"and the fractures, too, are rusty.\"  The two men looked at each other with a scare. \"This is beyond  me,    66)    Poole,\" said the lawyer. \"Let us go back to the cabinet.\"    They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional  awe-struck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to  examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were  traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white  salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in  which the unhappy man had been prevented.    \"That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\" said  Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise  boiled over.    This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn  cosily up, and the tea-things stood ready to the sitter's elbow,  the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf;  one lay beside the tea-things open, and Utterson was amazed to  find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several  times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand, with  startling blasphemies.    Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers  came to the cheval glass, into whose depths they looked with an  involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing  but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a  hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and  their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.    67)    \"This glass have seen some strange things, sir,\" whispered Poole.    \"And surely none stranger than itself,\" echoed the lawyer in the  same tones. \"For what did Jekyll\"--he caught himself up at the  word with a start, and then conquering the weakness--\"what  could Jekyll want with it?\" he said.    \"You may say that!\" said Poole. Next they turned to the  business-table. On the desk among the neat array of papers, a  large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the  name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several  enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the  same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months  before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of  gift in case of disappearance; but, in place of the name of  Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement, read the  name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back  at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched  upon the carpet.    \"My head goes round,\" he said. \"He has been all these days in  possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see  himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\"    He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor's  hand and dated at the top.    68)    \"O Poole!\" the lawyer cried, \"he was alive and here this day. He  cannot have been disposed of in so short a space, he must be  still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and  in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? Oh, we must  be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some  dire catastrophe.\"    \"Why don't you read it, sir?\" asked Poole.    \"Because I fear,\" replied the lawyer solemnly. \"God grant I have  no cause for it!\" And with that he brought the paper to his eyes  and read as follows:      \"MY DEAR UTTERSON,--When this shall fall into your hands, I  shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the  penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances  of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be  early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned  me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more,  turn to the confession of                      \"Your unworthy and unhappy friend,                                          \"HENRY JEKYLL.\"      \"There was a third enclosure?\" asked Utterson.    \"Here, sir,\" said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable  packet sealed in several places.    69)    The lawyer put it in his pocket. \"I would say nothing of this  paper. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save  his credit. It is now ten; I must go home and read these  documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we  shall send for the police.\"    They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and  Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire  in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two  narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.    70)                                  DR. LANYON'S NARRATIVE    ON the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the  evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of  my colleague and old school-companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good  deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of  correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the  night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that  should justify formality of registration. The contents increased  my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:                                     \"10th December, 18---    \"DEAR LANYON, You are one of my oldest friends; and although we  may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot  remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There  was never a day when, if you had said to me, 'Jekyll, my life, my  honour, my reason, depend upon you,' I would not have sacrificed  my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour my reason,  are all at your mercy;    71)    if you fail me to-night I am lost."]]]
