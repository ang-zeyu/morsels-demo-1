Daily they  scanned the pitiless blue sea for a glimpse of Ribaut's returning  sail.  No sail appeared, and daily their supplies dwindled away.  Had  it not been for the friendly Redmen they might all have perished.  For the Indians were generous, and as long as they had food themselves  they shared it with their white friends.  But at length they could  spare no more.  Indeed they had already given the Pale-faces so much  food that they themselves, they said, would be forced to roam the  woods in search of roots and herbs to keep them from starving until  harvest was ripe.  They told the Frenchmen, however, of two rich  and powerful chiefs who held sway over land which lay to the south,  where they might obtain endless supplies of corn and vegetables.    This was indeed good news to the Frenchmen.  And guided by their  Indian friends they lost no time in setting out to beg food from  those dusky potentates.    When the Frenchmen reached the wigwams of one of these chiefs they  were received with great honour.  They found that their Redskin  friends had spoken truly.  Here there was food in abundance; and  after a great feast they returned joyfully to the fort, carrying  with them a great supply of corn and beans, and - what was still  better - a promise from the friendly chief that he would give them  more food whenever they had need of it.    Once more the colonists rejoiced in plenty.  But not for long.  For  the very night they arrived home their storehouse took fire, and  all the food which they had brought with such joy was destroyed.    Again famine stared them in the face.  In their plight they once more  appealed to the savage chief who supplied their wants as generously  as before; promising them that as long as his meal should last they  should never want.  So for the time being the colonists were saved  from starvation.    But another danger now threatened them, for quarrels arose among  the men.  Albert de Pierria who had been set over them as captain  proved to be cruel and despotic.  He oppressed the men in many ways,  hanging and imprisoning at will those who displeased him.  Soon the  men began to murmur under his tyranny.  Black looks greeted Albert  de Pierria: he answered them with blacker deeds.  At length one  day for some misdeed he banished a soldier to a lonely island, and  left him there to die of hunger.  This was more than the colonists  could well bear.  Their smouldering anger burst forth, and seizing  the tyrant they put him to death.  Then they chose one of their  number called Nicolas Barre to be their captain.    They were rid of their tyrant, and that brought peace for a time  to the little colony.  But the men had grown to hate the place.  The  land which had once seemed to them so fair now seemed no better  than a prison, and they longed to escape from it.    They had, however, no ship, and although all around them tall  trees grew no one of them knew anything of ship building.  Still, so  strong was their desire to leave the hated spot that they resolved  to build one.    They set to work with. a will.  Soon the sound of saw and hammer  awoke the silence of the forest.  High and low, noble and peasant,  all worked together, the Indians, even, lending a hand.    At length their labours were over and the rough little ship was  afloat.  It made but a sorry appearance.  The planks were rough-hewn  by the hatchet, and caulked with the moss which grew in long  streamers on the trees.  The cordage was Indian made, and the sails  were patched together from shirts and bedclothes.  Never before had  men thought to dare the ocean waves in so crazy a craft.  But the  colonists were in such eagerness to be gone that they chose rather  to risk almost certain death upon the ocean than remain longer in  their vast prison house.    So they loaded the ship with as much food as they could collect,  and saying farewell to their Indian friends, they spread their  patchwork sails, and glided out to sea drunken with joy at the  thought of returning to France.    At first the wind blew fair, and the little ship sped gaily  homeward.  Then came a calm.  The sun burned overhead, no faintest  breeze stirred the slack sails, and the ship lay as if at anchor  upon the glassy waters.  And as the ship lay motionless the slender  stock of food grew less and less.  Soon there was nothing left but  maize, and little of that.  At first a tiny handful was each man's  daily portion; then it was counted by grains.  But jealously hoarded  although it was the maize at length gave out, and there was nothing  left to eat but their leather shoes and jerkins.    Then to the pain of hunger was added the pain of thirst, for the  water barrels were emptied to the last drop.  Unable to endure the  torture some drank the sea, water and so died in madness.  Beneath  the burning sun every timber of the crazy little ship warped and  started, and on all sides the sea flowed in.  Still through all  their agony the men clung to life.  And sick with hunger, maddened  with thirst as they were they laboured unceasingly bailing out  the water.  But they laboured now with despair in their hearts, and  they gave up hope of ever seeing their beloved France again.  Then  at length the pitiless sun was overcast, a wild wind arose, and  the glassy sea, whipped to fury, became a waste of foam and angry  billows.  The tiny vessel was tossed about helplessly and buffeted  this way and that.    \"In the turning of a hand,\" says an old writer, \"the waves filled  their vessel half full of water, and bruised it upon one side.\"    The wretched men now gave themselves up for lost.  They cared no  longer to bail, but cast themselves down into the bottom of the  boat, and let it drift where it would.  Only one man among them did  not utterly lose heart.  He set himself now to encourage the others,  telling them that if only the wind held, in three days they would  see the shores of France.    This man was so full of hope that at length he aroused the others  from their despair.  Once more they began the weary work of bailing,  and in spite of all the fury of the wind and waves the little vessel  kept afloat.    At last the storm passed.  Once more the fainting wanderers righted  their vessel, and turned the prow towards the shores of France.  But three days passed, and no land was seen, and they became more  despairing than before.    For now the last grain of corn was eaten, the last drop of water  drunk.  Mad with thirst, sick with hunger, the men strained their  weary eyes over the rolling waste of waters.  No land was in sight.  Then a terrible thought crept into one mind after another.  In a low  hoarse whisper one man and then another spoke out his thought-that  one man should die for his fellows.    So deep were they sunk in woe that all were of one mind.  So lots  were cast, and the man upon whom the lot fell was killed.    These tortured wayfarers had become cannibals.    Kept alive in this terrible fashion the men sailed on, and  at length a faint grey streak appeared on the horizon.  It was the  long-looked-for shore of France.  But the joy was too great for  their over-strained minds.  The sight of land seemed to rob them of  all power of thought or action.  With salvation in sight they let  the little vessel drift aimlessly this way and that.    While they thus drifted aimlessly a white sail hove in sight, and  an English vessel bore down upon them.  In the English vessel there  happened to be a Frenchman who had sailed with Ribaut on his first  voyage to Florida.  He soon recognised his countrymen in spite of  their sorry plight, and they were brought aboard the English vessel.  And when they had been given food and drink, and were somewhat  revived, they told their tale of misery.    The Englishmen were in doubt for some time as to what it was best  to do.  In the end they decided to set the most feeble on the shores  of France, and to carry the others prisoners to the Queen of England,  who at that time was about to send an expedition to Florida.    So ended the first attempt of the French to found a colony in North  America.    __________            Chapter 8 - How The French Founded a Colony in Florida          Two years after Ribaut's ill-fated expedition another company of  Frenchmen set sail for America.  This time Reté de Laudonnière was  captain.  He had been with Ribaut two years before, and now again  he landed on the same spot where Ribaut had first landed, and set  up the arms of France.    As they saw his ship come the Indians ran down to the beach welcoming  him with cries of excitement and joy, and taking him by the hand  the chief led him to the pillar which Jean Ribaut had set up.  It was  wreathed in flowers, and baskets of corn stood before it.  For the  Indians looked upon it as an idol, and made offerings to it.  They  kissed it with a great show of reverence, and begged the Frenchmen  to do the same. \"Which we would not deny them,\" says Laudonnière,  who himself tells the story, \"to the end we might draw them to be  more in friendship with us.\"    Laudonnière was so delighted with the natives' friendly greeting  that he resolved to found his colony among these kindly Indians.  So a little way up the river which Ribaut had named the river of  May, but which is now the St.  John's, he built a fort.    It was late one evening in June when the Frenchmen reached the  spot where they intended to build the fort; wearied with their long  march through the forest they lay down upon the ground and were  soon fast asleep.    But at day-break Laudonnière was astir.  He commanded a trumpet to  be sounded, and when all the men were aroused and stood together  he bade them give thanks to God for their safe arrival.  So standing  beneath the waving palms, with the deep blue sky arching overhead,  the men sang a psalm of thanksgiving and praise.

CREEL CENSUS      Fifty-three fishermen were interviewed in the 1957 creel census  period, and 152 in 1958. Only those fishermen using pole and line were  interviewed. In the area censused, much additional fishing is done  with set-lines, that are checked periodically by the owners.    In the 1958 census, 22 checks along approximately 80 miles of river  were made, and seven of these trips were made without seeing one  fisherman. The average fishing pressure for the entire area was  estimated at one fisherman per 7.9 miles of stream, or one fisherman  per 15.7 miles of shoreline.    Seven species of fish were identified from fishermen's creels in 1957  and 1958. These, in order of abundance were: channel catfish; carp;  freshwater drum; flathead catfish; shovelnose sturgeon; smallmouth  buffalo; and river carpsucker. Shovelnose sturgeon occurred in  fishermen's creels only in April, 1957, and freshwater drum occurred  more frequently in the spring-census of 1957 than in the summer of  1958.    Sixty-two of the fishermen interviewed in 1958 were fishing for  \"anything they could catch,\" 68 were fishing specifically for catfish,  and 22 sought species other than catfish. The order of preference was  as follows: channel catfish, 21.1 per cent; flathead catfish, 15.1 per  cent; unspecified catfish, 12.5 per cent; carp, 9.2 per cent;  freshwater drum, 1.3 per cent; and unspecified, 40.8 per cent. The  kinds of fish desired by those fishermen checked in 1957 were not  ascertained.    Of all fishermen checked in 1957 and 1958, 165 were men, 17 were  women, and 24 were children. Ninety-three per cent were fishing from  the bank, five per cent were fishing from bridges, and two per cent  were wading. All but two per cent of those checked were fishing  \"tightline\"; the remainder fished with a cork.    The ten baits most commonly used, in order of frequency, were worms,  doughballs, minnows, liver, beef-spleen, chicken-entrails, coagulated  blood, crayfish, shrimp, and corn.    For purposes of later comparison the data on angler success (Table 4)  have been divided according to areas: Area I, below Tuttle Creek Dam;  Area II, in the Tuttle Creek Reservoir area; and Area III, above the  reservoir. Areas I and III received the most fishing pressure,  especially Station 4-S (in Area I), and Station 56-S (in Area III).    In Area I, the success ranged from 0.91 fish per fisherman-day in 1957  to 0.26 fish per fisherman-day in 1958. The 1957 census was made in  April and May, when fishing in warm-water streams is considered better  than in July (Harrison, 1956:203). The 1958 census was from late June  through July, and stream-flow in this period was continuously above  normal. Therefore, fewer people fished the river, and catches were  irregular. Catches in 1958 ranged from 0.26 fish per fisherman-day in  Area I to 0.44 fish per fisherman-day in Area III. In 1951, in the  Republican River of Kansas and Nebraska, the average fisherman-day  yielded 0.36 fish, 0.09 fish per man-hour, and 0.06 fish per pole-hour  (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1952:13-14). The average  fisherman-day in the Republican River study was 3.0 hours, whereas the  average on the Big Blue River was 2.2 hours for all areas in 1958  (Table 4).       TABLE 4.

In the Republican River, 24 per cent of the  fishing parties were successful (1.64 persons per party) (U. S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, _loc. cit._). The average distance that each fisherman  had traveled to fish in the Big Blue River was 15.7 miles.

Probably the fishes that inhabit the backwaters, creek-mouths, and  borrow-pits in the Big Blue River Basin (gars, shad, carpsucker,  buffalo, carp, sunfishes, and white bass) will increase in abundance  as soon as Tuttle Creek Reservoir is formed. Also, as in eastern  Oklahoma reservoirs (see Finnell, _et al_., 1956:61-73), populations  of channel and flathead catfish should increase. Because of the  presence of brood-stock of the major sport-fishes of Kansas (channel  and flathead catfish, bullhead, bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass,  and white bass), stocking of these species would be an economic waste:  exception might be made for the white bass. It may be above Tuttle  Creek Dam, but was not found there.    I do recommend immediate introduction of walleye, and possibly  northern pike (_Esox lucius_ Linnaeus), the latter species having been  successfully stocked in Harlan County Reservoir, Nebraska, in recent  years (Mr. Donald D. Poole, personal communication). These two species  probably are native to Kansas, but may have been extirpated as  agricultural development progressed. Reservoirs may again provide  habitats suitable for these species in the State.    If Tuttle Creek Reservoir follows the pattern found in most Oklahoma  reservoirs, large populations of \"coarse fish\"--fishes that are,  however, commercially desirable--will develop (Finnell, _et al._,  _loc. cit._). To utilize this resource, and possibly to help control  \"coarse fish\" populations for the betterment of sport-fishing, some  provision for commercial harvest should be made in the reservoir.          SUMMARY      1. The Big Blue River Basin in northeastern Kansas was studied between  March 30, 1957, and August 9, 1958. The objectives were to record the  species of fish present and their relative abundance in the stream,  and to obtain a measure of angling success prior to closure of Tuttle  Creek Dam.    2. Fifty-nine stations were sampled one or more times, using seines,  hoop and fyke nets, wire traps, experimental gill nets, rotenone, and  an electric fish shocker.    3. Forty-eight species of fish were obtained, and five others have  been recorded in literature or found in museums. One species,  _Carpiodes forbesi_, is recorded from Kansas for the first time.    4. _Notropis lutrensis_ was the most abundant fish in the Big Blue  River Basin, followed by _Notropis deliciosus_ and _Ictalurus  punctatus_. The most abundant sport-fishes were _I. punctatus_,  _I. melas_, and _Pylodictis olivaris_, respectively.    5. The spawning behavior of _Notropis lutrensis_ is described.    6. A creel census at major points of access to the Big Blue River, was  taken in 1957 (below Tuttle Creek Dam) and in 1958 (above, in, and  below the dam-site). Fishing pressure averaged one fisherman per 15.7  miles of shoreline. The average length of the fisherman-day averaged  2.2 hours, with an average of 0.33 fish per fisherman-day being caught  in 1958. The average number of fish per man-hour in 1958 was 0.14 and  15.8 per cent of the fishermen were successful. Distances traveled in  order to fish ranged from 0 to 197 miles (airline) and averaged 15.7  miles.    7. The primary recommendation is that studies be continued, to  document changes that result from impoundment. Because brood-stock of  the major sport-fishes is already present, stocking is unnecessary,  except for walleye and northern pike. Also, I recommend commercial  harvest of non-game food-fishes.          LITERATURE CITED      BAILEY, R. M.       1956.
