Ye  shall come on board my brig for half an hour, till the ebb sets, and  drink a bowl with me.\"    Now, I longed to see the inside of a ship more than words can tell; but  I was not going to put myself in jeopardy, and I told him my uncle and I  had an appointment with a lawyer.    \"Ay, ay,\" said he, \"he passed me word of that. But, ye see, the boat'll  set ye ashore at the town pier, and that's but a penny stonecast from  Rankeillor's house.\" And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in  my ear: \"Take care of the old tod;* he means mischief. Come aboard till  I can get a word with ye.\" And then, passing his arm through mine, he  continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: \"But, come, what can I  bring ye from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour's can command.  A roll of tobacco? Indian feather-work? a skin of a wild beast? a stone  pipe? the mocking-bird that mews for all the world like a cat? the  cardinal bird that is as red as blood?--take your pick and say your  pleasure.\"         * Fox.    By this time we were at the boat-side, and he was handing me in. I did  not dream of hanging back; I thought (the poor fool!) that I had found  a good friend and helper, and I was rejoiced to see the ship. As soon as  we were all set in our places, the boat was thrust off from the pier  and began to move over the waters: and what with my pleasure in this new  movement and my surprise at our low position, and the appearance of the  shores, and the growing bigness of the brig as we drew near to it, I  could hardly understand what the captain said, and must have answered  him at random.    As soon as we were alongside (where I sat fairly gaping at the ship's  height, the strong humming of the tide against its sides, and the  pleasant cries of the seamen at their work) Hoseason, declaring that he  and I must be the first aboard, ordered a tackle to be sent down from  the main-yard. In this I was whipped into the air and set down again on  the deck, where the captain stood ready waiting for me, and instantly  slipped back his arm under mine. There I stood some while, a little  dizzy with the unsteadiness of all around me, perhaps a little afraid,  and yet vastly pleased with these strange sights; the captain meanwhile  pointing out the strangest, and telling me their names and uses.    \"But where is my uncle?\" said I suddenly.    \"Ay,\" said Hoseason, with a sudden grimness, \"that's the point.\"    I felt I was lost. With all my strength, I plucked myself clear of him  and ran to the bulwarks. Sure enough, there was the boat pulling for the  town, with my uncle sitting in the stern. I gave a piercing cry--\"Help,  help! Murder!\"--so that both sides of the anchorage rang with it, and  my uncle turned round where he was sitting, and showed me a face full of  cruelty and terror.    It was the last I saw. Already strong hands had been plucking me back  from the ship's side; and now a thunderbolt seemed to strike me; I saw a  great flash of fire, and fell senseless.          CHAPTER VII    I GO TO SEA IN THE BRIG \"COVENANT\" OF DYSART    I came to myself in darkness, in great pain, bound hand and foot, and  deafened by many unfamiliar noises. There sounded in my ears a roaring  of water as of a huge mill-dam, the thrashing of heavy sprays, the  thundering of the sails, and the shrill cries of seamen. The whole world  now heaved giddily up, and now rushed giddily downward; and so sick and  hurt was I in body, and my mind so much confounded, that it took me a  long while, chasing my thoughts up and down, and ever stunned again by  a fresh stab of pain, to realise that I must be lying somewhere bound in  the belly of that unlucky ship, and that the wind must have strengthened  to a gale. With the clear perception of my plight, there fell upon me a  blackness of despair, a horror of remorse at my own folly, and a passion  of anger at my uncle, that once more bereft me of my senses.    When I returned again to life, the same uproar, the same confused and  violent movements, shook and deafened me; and presently, to my other  pains and distresses, there was added the sickness of an unused landsman  on the sea. In that time of my adventurous youth, I suffered many  hardships; but none that was so crushing to my mind and body, or lit by  so few hopes, as these first hours aboard the brig.    I heard a gun fire, and supposed the storm had proved too strong for us,  and we were firing signals of distress. The thought of deliverance, even  by death in the deep sea, was welcome to me. Yet it was no such matter;  but (as I was afterwards told) a common habit of the captain's, which  I here set down to show that even the worst man may have his kindlier  side. We were then passing, it appeared, within some miles of Dysart,  where the brig was built, and where old Mrs. Hoseason, the captain's  mother, had come some years before to live; and whether outward or  inward bound, the Covenant was never suffered to go by that place by  day, without a gun fired and colours shown.    I had no measure of time; day and night were alike in that ill-smelling  cavern of the ship's bowels where I lay; and the misery of my situation  drew out the hours to double. How long, therefore, I lay waiting to hear  the ship split upon some rock, or to feel her reel head foremost into  the depths of the sea, I have not the means of computation. But sleep at  length stole from me the consciousness of sorrow.    I was awakened by the light of a hand-lantern shining in my face. A  small man of about thirty, with green eyes and a tangle of fair hair,  stood looking down at me.    \"Well,\" said he, \"how goes it?\"    I answered by a sob; and my visitor then felt my pulse and temples, and  set himself to wash and dress the wound upon my scalp.    \"Ay,\" said he, \"a sore dunt*. What, man? Cheer up! The world's no done;  you've made a bad start of it but you'll make a better. Have you had any  meat?\"         * Stroke.    I said I could not look at it: and thereupon he gave me some brandy and  water in a tin pannikin, and left me once more to myself.    The next time he came to see me, I was lying betwixt sleep and waking,  my eyes wide open in the darkness, the sickness quite departed, but  succeeded by a horrid giddiness and swimming that was almost worse  to bear. I ached, besides, in every limb, and the cords that bound me  seemed to be of fire. The smell of the hole in which I lay seemed to  have become a part of me; and during the long interval since his last  visit I had suffered tortures of fear, now from the scurrying of the  ship's rats, that sometimes pattered on my very face, and now from the  dismal imaginings that haunt the bed of fever.    The glimmer of the lantern, as a trap opened, shone in like the heaven's  sunlight; and though it only showed me the strong, dark beams of the  ship that was my prison, I could have cried aloud for gladness. The man  with the green eyes was the first to descend the ladder, and I noticed  that he came somewhat unsteadily. He was followed by the captain.  Neither said a word; but the first set to and examined me, and dressed  my wound as before, while Hoseason looked me in my face with an odd,  black look.    \"Now, sir, you see for yourself,\" said the first: \"a high fever, no  appetite, no light, no meat: you see for yourself what that means.\"    \"I am no conjurer, Mr. Riach,\" said the captain.    \"Give me leave, sir,\" said Riach; \"you've a good head upon your  shoulders, and a good Scotch tongue to ask with; but I will leave you no  manner of excuse; I want that boy taken out of this hole and put in the  forecastle.\"    \"What ye may want, sir, is a matter of concern to nobody but yoursel',\"  returned the captain; \"but I can tell ye that which is to be. Here he  is; here he shall bide.\"    \"Admitting that you have been paid in a proportion,\" said the other, \"I  will crave leave humbly to say that I have not. Paid I am, and none too  much, to be the second officer of this old tub, and you ken very well if  I do my best to earn it. But I was paid for nothing more.\"    \"If ye could hold back your hand from the tin-pan, Mr. Riach, I would  have no complaint to make of ye,\" returned the skipper; \"and instead  of asking riddles, I make bold to say that ye would keep your breath to  cool your porridge. We'll be required on deck,\" he added, in a sharper  note, and set one foot upon the ladder.    But Mr. Riach caught him by the sleeve.    \"Admitting that you have been paid to do a murder----\" he began.    Hoseason turned upon him with a flash.    \"What's that?\" he cried. \"What kind of talk is that?\"    \"It seems it is the talk that you can understand,\" said Mr. Riach,  looking him steadily in the face.    \"Mr. Riach, I have sailed with ye three cruises,\" replied the captain.  \"In all that time, sir, ye should have learned to know me: I'm a stiff  man, and a dour man; but for what ye say the now--fie, fie!--it comes  from a bad heart and a black conscience. If ye say the lad will die----\"    \"Ay, will he!\" said Mr. Riach.    \"Well, sir, is not that enough?\" said Hoseason. \"Flit him where ye  please!\"    Thereupon the captain ascended the ladder; and I, who had lain silent  throughout this strange conversation, beheld Mr. Riach turn after him  and bow as low as to his knees in what was plainly a spirit of derision.  Even in my then state of sickness, I perceived two things: that the  mate was touched with liquor, as the captain hinted, and that (drunk or  sober) he was like to prove a valuable friend.    Five minutes afterwards my bonds were cut, I was hoisted on a man's  back, carried up to the forecastle, and laid in a bunk on some  sea-blankets; where the first thing that I did was to lose my senses.    It was a blessed thing indeed to open my eyes again upon the daylight,  and to find myself in the society of men. The forecastle was a roomy  place enough, set all about with berths, in which the men of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#9)"],[1,"friendship, then robbery and massacre,  then slavery, and finally extermination, was the unvarying  programme. And so, instead of winning favor and loyalty with their  consequent happiness and prosperity from the native tribes,  Spanish conquerors implanted in the possessors of the country an  over-mastering and ineradicable hatred, which grew with  association, until in colony after colony the bonds were burst by  violence.    When Great Britain lost her American colonies by reason of her  misgovernment and oppression of them, it was a lesson which her  people never forgot. From that day, the colonial policy of the  British government was altered, and the spirit of liberality and  generosity began to dominate. To-day, every colony of Great  Britain that enjoys representative government--Canada, Australia,  Cape Colony and many others, owes to the United States the liberty  which Great Britain grants.    But Spain could learn no such lessons. Her cruelty and  misgovernment aroused colony after colony to rebellion ending in  freedom, but her policies remained unaltered. One by one  possessions of fabulous wealth dropped away until at last this old  crone of nations has been left to shiver alone by her fireside,  abandoned in her misery by all the children whose memory of her is  nothing but that of vicious cruelty. The only pity to which Spain  is entitled, is the pity that is due for her ignorance and her  mistakes, not pity for the penalties that these have brought upon  her.    Spain was once the intellectual leader of the world, as well as  the pioneer of discovery. Spanish universities were centers of  learning long before northern Europe had its intellectual birth.  Spanish mariners sailed every sea and Spanish adventurers explored  every land. If learning and advancement bring obligations, as they  are admitted to do, it was Spain's obligation to be a leader in  strife for liberty of mind and body, but the two most notable  things in her history are the Spanish inquisition against freedom  of thought, and the Spanish ferocities which enslaved a new world  for many a year. Now she has reaped the harvest of her own  misdeeds.    THE EARLY SETTLEMENT OF CUBA.    Every one knows that Columbus was not looking for a western  hemisphere, but for the Orient, and that when he found Cuba he  believed he had reached the East Indies and the islands of gold  and spice which had been reported from that mysterious land. His  first island discoveries he believed to be the outlying portions  of that eastern archipelago and when the natives told him of a  greater land near by, which he reached a few days later, he  believed that at last he had reached Cipango, as Japan then was  called.    The first name given to the island was Juana, in honor of Prince  Juan, the son of Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castile.  After Ferdinand's death, in his honor the name was changed to  Fernandina. Still later it received the name of Santiago, as a  mark of reverence for the patron saint of Spain, and another  change was made a few years afterward, when the inhabitants, as a  proof of their piety, called it Ave Maria, in honor of the Holy  Virgin. In spite of all this effort at establishing a Spanish  name, the original Indian name of Cuba, which it bore when the  great navigator first landed on its shores, has asserted itself  triumphantly through all the centuries and is now ineradicable.    According to the accounts given by Spanish writers who were  contemporary with the discovery, and the century immediately  following, the aboriginal inhabitants of Cuba were a generous,  gentle, hospitable people, by no means energetic, but heartily  cordial and courteous to the strangers who reached their shores.  The mildness of their climate did not stimulate them to much  activity in cultivation of the soil, because tropical fruits and  vegetables came with scarcely an effort on the part of the  natives. Their implements and utensils were crude and their life  simple.    The system of government was by no means complicated. The island  was divided into nine independent principalities, each under a  Cacique, all living in harmony, and warfare being almost unknown.  Their religion was a peaceful one, without human sacrifices or  cannibalism, but the priests had great power through their  pretense of influence with spirits good and evil.    Of all the people discovered by the Spanish in their colonization  of the western hemisphere, the Cubans were the most tractable to  the influences of Christianity so far as their willingness to  accept the doctrines was concerned. Christianity, as practiced by  the Spanish conquerors, was scarcely that of the highest type of  the faith, and the inducements to accept it were somewhat violent.  Nevertheless it must be noted that it is from Spanish sources this  testimony as to the docility of the Cuban natives comes. Under  these circumstances it becomes a magnified crime that the Spanish  conquerors absolutely exterminated the hundreds of thousands of  native Cubans whom they found at the time of the discovery, and  that within little more than a century, there was absolutely not a  trace of native stock to be found anywhere in the island.    When Columbus first rested his eyes on the island of Cuba it  seemed to him an enchanted land. He was charmed with its lofty  mountains, its beautiful rivers, and its blossoming groves, and in  his account of the voyage he said: \"Everything is green as April  in Andalusia. The singing of the birds is such that it seems as if  one would never desire to depart. There are flocks of parrots that  obscure the sun. There are trees of a thousand species, each  having its particular fruit, and all of marvelous flavor.\"    Columbus was first of the opinion that he had found an island, but  after following the shores for many miles he concluded that it was  a continent. He retained the latter belief until his death, for it  was not until 1508 that the island was circumnavigated, when it  was discovered that it was of about the same area as England. In a  subsequent expedition he reached the coast of South America, but  he had no appreciation of the magnitude of that continent, and to  him Cuba was the grandest of his discoveries in the New World.    Cuba was twice visited by Columbus after its discovery, in April,  1494, and again in 1502, and these visits but confirmed his first  opinion regarding the salubrity of the climate and the wealth of  the soil. His sailors wrested from the natives large sums of gold  and silver, and this led to the mistaken belief that mines of  great richness were within their grasp.    SPAIN'S HEARTLESS TREATMENT OF COLUMBUS.    Biography furnishes no parallel to the life of Columbus. Great men  there have been who have met with injustice and disappointments,  but there is perhaps no other instance of a man whom  disappointments and injustice did not dishearten and disgust; who  had his greatness recognized in his lifetime, and yet was robbed  of the rewards that it entitled him to.    It is probable that before his death Columbus confided his belief  in the wealth to be found in Cuba to his son Diego Columbus, for  in 1511 the latter fitted out an expedition for the purpose of  colonizing the island. This company consisted of about 300 men,  under Diego Velasquez, who had accompanied the great explorer on  his second voyage. The first settlement was made at Baracoa, in  the extreme eastern section, and this village was regarded as the  capital of the colony for several years. In the meantime extensive  settlements had been made by the Spaniards in the island of  Jamaica, and in 1514 the towns of Santiago and Trinidad were  founded on the southern coast of Cuba, in order that the  inhabitants of the two colonies might be brought into closer  communication. As immigration increased, other towns of importance  sprung up, and the island became the base for the various  operations against Mexico. Baracoa grew largely in population, and  the towns of Puerto Principe and Sancti Espiritus were established  in the central section, and San Juan de los Remedios on the north  coast. In July, 1515, the city of San Cristobal de la Habana was  planted, deriving its name from the great Discoverer, but this  name was transferred in 1519 to the present capital, and the  original town was called Batabano.    In 1518 the capital was fixed at Baracoa, which had by this time  become a city of considerable importance, and the diocese of the  colony. In 1522 both the seat of government and the bishopric were  removed to Santiago de Cuba. In 1538 Havana was reduced to ashes  by a French privateer; and to prevent a similar disaster in  future, the Castillo de la Fuerza, a fortress which still exists,  was built by Fernando de Soto, governor of Cuba, and afterwards  famous for his explorations in the southern and western portions  of North America, as well as for the discovery of the Mississippi.    Using a modern expression, this great fortress, added to her  almost perfect harbor, gave Havana a wonderful \"boom,\" and the  city experienced a remarkable growth. The Spanish merchantmen were  actively employed in carrying the wealth of Mexico to the  Peninsula, and Havana was a convenient port for them to secure  supplies of provisions and water. In 1549 Gonzales Perez de Angulo  was appointed governor of the island, and he was so impressed with  the beauties of the city, that he chose it as his residence.  Several of his successors followed his example, and in 1589 it was  legally made the capital of Cuba.    EARLY GOVERNMENT OF CUBA.    The early records of the island were kept in so imperfect a manner  that it is not possible to give an accurate account of the early  governors and their lieutenants. It is certain, however, that the  seat of government was at Santiago de Cuba, and that Havana and  other towns of minor importance were ruled by lieutenants. In  1538,"]]]
