For many years it was the opinion of all ranks of people, that the  Hudson's Bay Company were averse to making discoveries of every kind;  and being content with the profits of their small capital, as it was  then called, did not want to increase their trade. What might have been  the ideas of former members of the Company respecting the first part of  these charges I cannot say, but I am well assured that they, as well as  the present members, have always been ready to embrace every plausible  plan for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38418"],[0,"From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America (#9)"],[1,"ures, far down to the southeast. Just above my position the  bluff graded down in even decline to Mitchell's Ford, the position  assigned for Bonham's brigade, the latter being on the concave of the  river, six hundred yards retired from my left and at the crossing of the  direct road between Centreville and Manassas Junction. At the Junction  well-constructed battery epaulements were prepared for defence.    The bluff of the north bank was first designated as my most suitable  ground, and I was ordered to open the front, lay out and construct  trenches, to be concealed by green pine-boughs. The regiments were from  Richmond, Lynchburg, and Alexandria,--more familiar with the amenities of  city life than with the axe, pick, spade, or shovel. They managed,  however, to bring down as many as half a dozen spreading second-growth  pines in the course of two days' work, when General Beauregard concluded  that the advanced position of the brigade would mar his general plan, and  ordered the line to be taken along the river bank of the south side, under  the woodland, and close under the bluff, a position only approvable as  temporary under accepted rules of warfare, but this proved a favorable  exception between the raw forces of the contending armies. In addition to  the two brigades on my right, the Sixth Brigade, under Colonel Jubal A.  Early, was posted (with artillery) near the fords. As proximate but  separate commands, stood General Theo. Holmes, thirty miles off to the  right, with a brigade, a battery, and cavalry, at and about Acquia Creek,  and General J. E. Johnston, sixty miles away, over the Blue Ridge  Mountains. Holmes's should have been an outpost, but he had ranked  Beauregard in the old service, and as a point of etiquette was given a  separate command. Johnston's command should have been an outlying  contingent, but he had been assigned to the Shenandoah Valley when,  because threatened with immediate invasion, it was of first importance.  Beauregard was subsequently assigned to Manassas Junction, which, under  later developments, became the strategic point. As Johnston was his  senior, another delicate question arose, that was not solved until the  tramp of McDowell's army was heard on the Warrenton Turnpike.    The armies preparing for the first grand conflict were commanded by West  Point graduates, both of the class of 1838,--Beauregard and McDowell. The  latter had been assigned to command of the Federal forces at Washington,  south of the Potomac, in the latter part of May, 1861. The former had  assumed command of the Confederates at Manassas Junction about the 1st of  June.    McDowell marched on the afternoon of the 16th of July at the head of an  army of five divisions of infantry, supplemented by nine field batteries  of the regular service, one of volunteers, besides two guns operating  separately, and seven companies of regular cavalry. In his infantry  columns were eight companies of regulars and a battalion of marines, an  aggregate of thirty-five thousand men.    Beauregard stood behind Bull Run with seven brigades, including Holmes,  who joined on the 19th, twenty-nine guns, fourteen hundred cavalry,--an  aggregate of twenty-one thousand nine hundred men, all volunteers. To this  should be added, for the battle of the 21st, reinforcements aggregating  eight thousand five hundred men, under General Johnston, making the sum of  the aggregate, thirty thousand four hundred.    The line behind Bull Run was the best between Washington and the Rapidan  for strategy, tactics, and army supplies.    General Beauregard gave minute instructions to his brigade commanders of  his position and general plan, which in itself was admirable. Bonham was  to retire from Fairfax Court-House, as the enemy advanced, and take his  place behind Mitchell's Ford on the Centreville and Manassas Junction  road. It was proposed that he should engage his rear-guard so as to try to  bring on the battle against him, as he approached his crossing of Bull  Run, when the brigades along the Run on his right should cross, wheel to  the left and attack on the enemy's left and rear.    We had occasional glimpses behind the lines about Washington, through  parties who managed to evade the eyes of guards and sentinels, which told  of McDowell's work since May, and heard on the 10th of July that he was  ready to march. Most of us knew him and of his attainments, as well as of  those of Beauregard, to the credit of the latter, so that on that point we  were quite satisfied. But the backing of an organized government, and an  army led by the foremost American war-chief, that consummate  strategist, tactician, and organizer, General Scott, together with the  splendid equipment of the field batteries, and the presence of the force  of regulars of infantry, gave serious apprehension.      [Illustration: John B. Richardson. Captain Washington Artillery of New  Orleans; whose battery fired the first gun at Manassas, July, 1861, and  claims the last gun at Appomattox.]      On the 16th of July notice came that the advance of McDowell's army was  under definite orders for the next day. My brigade was at once ordered  into position at Blackburn's Ford, and all others were ordered on the  alert. Cocke's detachments were recalled from the fords between Mitchell's  and Stone Bridge, and Evans was left to hold the bridge. Bonham withdrew  from Fairfax Court-House as McDowell advanced. He retired behind the Run  at Mitchell's Ford, his vedettes following after exchanging shots with the  enemy's advance on the 18th. Early that morning a section of the  Washington Artillery was posted on a rear line behind Blackburn's Ford,  and trailed across towards the left, so as to flank fire against the  direct advance upon Bonham at Mitchell's Ford.    At eight o'clock A.M. on the 18th, McDowell's army concentrated about  Centreville, his immediate objective being Manassas Junction. From  Centreville the Warrenton Turnpike bears off a little south of west,  crossing Bull Run at Stone Bridge (four miles). The Manassas Junction road  due south crosses at Mitchell's Ford (three miles). Other farm roads  turned to the fords above and below Mitchell's. His orders to General  Tyler, commanding the advance division, were to look well to the roads on  the direct route to Manassas Junction and _via_ the Stone Bridge, to  impress an advance upon the former, but to have care not to bring on a  general engagement. At the same time he rode towards his left to know of  the feasibility of a turning move around the Confederates' right. There  were three moves by which it was supposed he could destroy the  Confederates,--first, by turning their right; second, by direct and  forcible march to the Junction; third, by turning their left. McDowell's  orders to his leading divisions indicated that he had settled down to a  choice as to the two opposite flanking moves; but to justify either he  must first test the feasibility of the direct route. The ride to his left  disclosed rough ground, rocky heights cut by streamlets, and covered by  heavy forest tangle, as formidable to military manoeuvres of raw troops as  armed battlements. According to preconceived plans, this eliminated the  question of the flanking move by the Confederate right.    Under the instructions, as General Tyler construed them, he followed the  Confederates to the heights of Centreville, overlooking the valley of Bull  Run, with a squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry. From the  heights to the Run, a mile away, the field was open, and partially  disclosed the Confederate position on his right. On the left the view was  limited by a sparse growth of spreading pines. On the right was Mitchell's  Ford, on the left Blackburn's. To have a better knowledge of the latter,  he called up a brigade of infantry under General Richardson, Ayres's  battery of six field-guns, and two twenty-pound rifle guns under Benjamin.  The artillery was brought into action by the twenty-pound rifle guns, the  first shot aimed at the section of the Washington Artillery six-pounders  in rear of Blackburn's Ford, showing superior marksmanship, the ball  striking close beside the guns, and throwing the dust over the caissons  and gunners.    It was noticed that the enemy was far beyond our range, his position  commanding, as well as his metal, so I ordered the guns withdrawn to a  place of safety, till a fairer opportunity was offered them. The guns were  limbered and off before a second shot reached them. Artillery practice of  thirty minutes was followed by an advance of infantry. The march was made  quite up to the bluff overlooking the ford, when both sides opened fire.    The first pouring-down volleys were most startling to the new troops.  Part of my line broke and started at a run. To stop the alarm I rode with  sabre in hand for the leading files, determined to give them all that was  in the sword and my horse's heels, or stop the break. They seemed to see  as much danger in their rear as in front, and soon turned and marched back  to their places, to the evident surprise of the enemy. Heavy firing was  renewed in ten or fifteen minutes, when the Federals retired. After about  twenty minutes a second advance was made to the top of the bluff, when  another rousing fusillade followed, and continued about as long as the  first, with like result. I reinforced the front line with part of my  reserve, and, thinking to follow up my next success, called for one of the  regiments of the reserve brigade.    Colonel Hays, of the Seventh Louisiana Regiment, was sent, but was not in  time for the next attack. He was in position for the fourth, and did his  share in that fight. After the fourth repulse I ordered the advance, and  called for the balance of the reserve brigade. The Fourth Brigade, in  their drills in evolution, had not progressed as far as the passage of  defiles. The pass at the ford was narrow, unused, and "]]]
