One can however scarcely decide if his       obstinate moroseness be a precaution against drunkenness, or       the effect of spirituous liquors taken in excess. At some of       the taverns are three gentlemen, dressed in black, with       white cravats, who sing after one of them has struck the       table with a little hammer; they are as serious as       Protestant ministers or money-changers.\"    English food--         \"Thick stupefying beer, meat almost raw and horribly spiced;       strong libations of port wine, followed by       plum-pudding--such is the meat of these islanders.\"    How the English eat--         \"They eat at every hour, every where, and incessantly. The       iron constitution of their complaisant stomachs enables them       to feed in a manner which would satisfy wolves and lions.       The delicate repast of a fair and sentimental young lady       would be too much for a couple of Parisian street porters.\"    Stables and museums--         \"Stables are clean and brilliant as museums ought to be; and       the museums are as filthy as stables in Provence.\"    The Queen's stables--         \"They form a college of horses, with pedantic grooms for       professors, and a harness room for a library:\"    English omnibuses--         \"The omnibuses of London are worn out, ill built, and       remarkably dirty. Even in wet weather nobody is ever allowed       to enter the interior so long as any places are vacant       outside. We had expected to find them built of mahogany and       lined with velvet.\"    London--         \"London, wholly devoted to private interests, offers nothing       to the heart or mind. The city is too large; a man is lost       in it; you elbow thousands of people without the hope of       meeting any one you know. Even if you have a large fortune       you would be ignored. Originality is there without effect;       vanity without an object; and the desire of shining is       chimerical. Intelligence has therefore only one opening,       politics; pride only one object, the national sentiment; but       as the people must feel enthusiasm for something, they adore       horses; and as they must admire somebody, they burn incense       under Lord Wellington's nose.\"    After midnight--         \"At midnight the English leave the taverns, the public       gardens, the theatres, and the open air balls, and fill up       the supper saloons (not very reputable places), and the       oyster rooms, where they eat till morning. After sunrise,       the policemen are occupied in picking up in the gutters       drunkards of both sexes, and all conditions.\"    London rain--         \"It is tallow melted in water, and perfectly black.\"    A bad quarter--         \"Between Cornhill Street and Thames Street, there lives what       is called the populace of London; there pauperism is       frightful. The wretched inhabitants of that district are       brawlers, drunkards, and prize-fighters.\"    At Westminster Abbey--         \"Shakspeare slumbers at a few steps from Richard II. The       tombs bear traces of Presbyterian mutilations; but in other       places the Calvinists scattered the bones of the deceased       Bishops of Geneva. Such is the intolerance of the       Protestants that they have not admitted the statue of Byron       to the Abbey, and his shadow may be heard groaning at the       door.\"    At Her Majesty's Theatre--         \"To go with a blue cravat is _shocking_. When the doors are       open, blows with the fist and the elbow are given without       regard to age or sex. It is the peculiar fashion of entering       which the natives have. If a Frenchman be recognized the       people cry _French dog_. In the pit, the man behind you will       place his foot on your shoulder. The ladies are plunged up       to the neck in boxes. In the theatre there is an echo, which       produces an abominable effect; but such is the vile musical       taste of the English that they have never found it out. In       the saloon you hear the continual hissing of teakettles.\"    The English Parliament--         \"The House of Commons at present meets in a hole. The peers       are in their new chamber. It is small, not monumental, and       heavily ornamented. It reminds one of our tea shops, or a       _boudoir_. The lords, when assembled, are generally placed       on their backs, or rather lean on the back of the neck, and       keep their legs above their heads. The Queen's throne, like       constitutional royalty, is a gilded cage.\"    The new Houses of Parliament--         \"They are an immense architectural plaything, and the       English only admire them because they cost a vast sum.\"    English love of titles--         \"One of my friends gave me a letter of introduction to Sir       William P----, _Esquire_. I left the letter with my card at       the Reform Club, Pall Mall. Two hours after Sir William came       to my residence; but as I was not at home he wrote a line,       and addressed it to me with the flattering designation of       _Esquire_. England is the country of legal equality; but       this sort of equilibrium does not extend to social usages;       and although our _penchant_ for distinctions seems puerile       to the English, it would be easy to prove that they are not       exempt from it. They have not, as we have, the love of       uniforms, laced coats, epaulettes, or decorations; their       button-holes often carry a flower, but never a rosette or       knot of ribbon. But every body pretends to the title of       _Sir_, which was formerly reserved exclusively to members of       the House of Commons, to Baronets, and to some public       functionaries. As, however, the title _Sir_ has become too       vulgar, every body calls himself _Esquire_ to distinguish       himself from his neighbor. This remark, nevertheless, does       not concern my friend Sir William, for he is really an       Esquire.\"    English soldiers--         \"The noise which announces their approach is very singular.       Picture to yourself the monotonous music of a bear's dance,       executed by twenty fifers, whilst a man beats a big drum.       The coats of the infantry are too short, and are surmounted       with large white epaulettes. The men sway their bodies about       to the beating of the drum, and carry their heads so stiffly       that they appear to be balancing spoons on their noses. All       the officers and non-commissioned officers carry long sticks       with ivory handles.\"    Resemblance of Englishmen one to another--         \"All Englishmen are alike. They live in the same way, are       subject to the same logical rules, condemned to the same       amusements. The proof that there exists only one character       amongst them, and that they have only one way of living, is,       that it is impossible, on seeing them, to divine their       profession. A lord, a minister, a domestic, a street singer,       a merchant, an admiral, a soldier, a general, an artist, a       judge, a prize-fighter, and a clergyman, have all the same       appearance, the same language, the same costume, and the       same bearing. Each one has the air of an Englishman, and       nothing more. They live in the same way, work at the same       hours, eat at the same time, and of the same sort of food,       and are all sequestrated when away from home from the       society of women.\"    The French at London--         \"At London the French labor under two subjects of anxiety,       caused by their national prejudices. Accustomed to consider       themselves as the first people in the world, to dazzle some,       to despise others, and to display every where the confident       pride of their supremacy, they, on treading the British       soil, experience the impression of a greatness not borrowed       from them; they are astonished at finding a people as       remarkable as ours, as original as we are, and carrying to a       still prouder degree the sentiment of their pre-eminence.       Then our countrymen become disquieted; the intolerance of       their national faith becomes mitigated; they are ill at       ease, and for the first time in their lives feel constraint.       Ceasing to believe themselves amongst slaves as in Italy,       amongst vassals as in Belgium, or amongst innkeepers as in       Switzerland or Germany, they endeavor to resemble sovereigns       visiting other sovereigns, and by forced politeness render       them involuntary homage.\"    Feeling of the English toward the French--         \"They honor us with a marked attention, though they are       indifferent to the rest of mankind. Our opinions respecting       them cause them anxiety. They either admire us       enthusiastically, or disparage us bitterly; but, in reality,       they are obsequious and servile toward us!\"    After a good deal of the numerous statues to Wellington, this at  English admiration of Waterloo--         \"The trumpet of Waterloo which has been sounded in London       every where incessantly, and in every tone, during       thirty-five years, diminishes the grandeur of the English       nation. This intoxication seems that of a people who, never       having won more than one battle, and despairing to conquer a       second time, cannot recover from their surprise, nor bear in       patience an unhoped-for glory.\"    How the English judge Napoleon--         \"Public opinion has avenged the prisoner of St Helena; but       does it follow that in 1815 the English protested with       sufficient energy against his imprisonment! No. Englishmen       are naturally indifferent and indulgent as regards their       foreign neighbors, so long as patriotism or private interest       is not at stake. Napoleon was the most terrible of their       enemies; he placed England within ten steps of bankruptcy,       and seriously menaced national manufactures.

Malays engaged in the search for camphor  eat their food dry and take care not to pound their salt fine. The  reason is that the camphor occurs in the form of small grains  deposited in the cracks of the trunk of the camphor tree.  Accordingly it seems plain to the Malay that if, while seeking for  camphor, he were to eat his salt finely ground, the camphor would be  found also in fine grains; whereas by eating his salt coarse he  ensures that the grains of the camphor will also be large. Camphor  hunters in Borneo use the leathery sheath of the leaf-stalk of the  Penang palm as a plate for food, and during the whole of the  expedition they will never wash the plate, for fear that the camphor  might dissolve and disappear from the crevices of the tree.  Apparently they think that to wash their plates would be to wash out  the camphor crystals from the trees in which they are imbedded. The  chief product of some parts of Laos, a province of Siam, is lac.  This is a resinous gum exuded by a red insect on the young branches  of trees, to which the little creatures have to be attached by hand.  All who engage in the business of gathering the gum abstain from  washing themselves and especially from cleansing their heads, lest  by removing the parasites from their hair they should detach the  other insects from the boughs. Again, a Blackfoot Indian who has set  a trap for eagles, and is watching it, would not eat rosebuds on any  account; for he argues that if he did so, and an eagle alighted near  the trap, the rosebuds in his own stomach would make the bird itch,  with the result that instead of swallowing the bait the eagle would  merely sit and scratch himself. Following this train of thought the  eagle hunter also refrains from using an awl when he is looking  after his snares; for surely if he were to scratch with an awl, the  eagles would scratch him. The same disastrous consequence would  follow if his wives and children at home used an awl while he is out  after eagles, and accordingly they are forbidden to handle the tool  in his absence for fear of putting him in bodily danger.    Among the taboos observed by savages none perhaps are more numerous  or important than the prohibitions to eat certain foods, and of such  prohibitions many are demonstrably derived from the law of  similarity and are accordingly examples of negative magic. Just as  the savage eats many animals or plants in order to acquire certain  desirable qualities with which he believes them to be endowed, so he  avoids eating many other animals and plants lest he should acquire  certain undesirable qualities with which he believes them to be  infected. In eating the former he practises positive magic; in  abstaining from the latter he practises negative magic. Many  examples of such positive magic will meet us later on; here I will  give a few instances of such negative magic or taboo. For example,  in Madagascar soldiers are forbidden to eat a number of foods lest  on the principle of homoeopathic magic they should be tainted by  certain dangerous or undesirable properties which are supposed to  inhere in these particular viands. Thus they may not taste hedgehog,  \"as it is feared that this animal, from its propensity of coiling up  into a ball when alarmed, will impart a timid shrinking disposition  to those who partake of it.\" Again, no soldier should eat an ox's  knee, lest like an ox he should become weak in the knees and unable  to march. Further, the warrior should be careful to avoid partaking  of a cock that has died fighting or anything that has been speared  to death; and no male animal may on any account be killed in his  house while he is away at the wars. For it seems obvious that if he  were to eat a cock that had died fighting, he would himself be slain  on the field of battle; if he were to partake of an animal that had  been speared, he would be speared himself; if a male animal were  killed in his house during his absence, he would himself be killed  in like manner and perhaps at the same instant. Further, the  Malagasy soldier must eschew kidneys, because in the Malagasy  language the word for kidney is the same as that for \"shot\"; so shot  he would certainly be if he ate a kidney.    The reader may have observed that in some of the foregoing examples  of taboos the magical influence is supposed to operate at  considerable distances; thus among the Blackfeet Indians the wives  and children of an eagle hunter are forbidden to use an awl during  his absence, lest the eagles should scratch the distant husband and  father; and again no male animal may be killed in the house of a  Malagasy soldier while he is away at the wars, lest the killing of  the animal should entail the killing of the man. This belief in the  sympathetic influence exerted on each other by persons or things at  a distance is of the essence of magic. Whatever doubts science may  entertain as to the possibility of action at a distance, magic has  none; faith in telepathy is one of its first principles. A modern  advocate of the influence of mind upon mind at a distance would have  no difficulty in convincing a savage; the savage believed in it long  ago, and what is more, he acted on his belief with a logical  consistency such as his civilised brother in the faith has not yet,  so far as I am aware, exhibited in his conduct. For the savage is  convinced not only that magical ceremonies affect persons and things  afar off, but that the simplest acts of daily life may do so too.  Hence on important occasions the behaviour of friends and relations  at a distance is often regulated by a more or less elaborate code of  rules, the neglect of which by the one set of persons would, it is  supposed, entail misfortune or even death on the absent ones. In  particular when a party of men are out hunting or fighting, their  kinsfolk at home are often expected to do certain things or to  abstain from doing certain others, for the sake of ensuring the  safety and success of the distant hunters or warriors. I will now  give some instances of this magical telepathy both in its positive  and in its negative aspect.    In Laos when an elephant hunter is starting for the chase, he warns  his wife not to cut her hair or oil her body in his absence; for if  she cut her hair the elephant would burst the toils, if she oiled  herself it would slip through them. When a Dyak village has turned  out to hunt wild pigs in the jungle, the people who stay at home may  not touch oil or water with their hands during the absence of their  friends; for if they did so, the hunters would all be  \"butter-fingered\" and the prey would slip through their hands.    Elephant-hunters in East Africa believe that, if their wives prove  unfaithful in their absence, this gives the elephant power over his  pursuer, who will accordingly be killed or severely wounded. Hence  if a hunter hears of his wife's misconduct, he abandons the chase  and returns home. If a Wagogo hunter is unsuccessful, or is attacked  by a lion, he attributes it to his wife's misbehaviour at home, and  returns to her in great wrath. While he is away hunting, she may not  let any one pass behind her or stand in front of her as she sits;  and she must lie on her face in bed. The Moxos Indians of Bolivia  thought that if a hunter's wife was unfaithful to him in his absence  he would be bitten by a serpent or a jaguar. Accordingly, if such an  accident happened to him, it was sure to entail the punishment, and  often the death, of the woman, whether she was innocent or guilty.  An Aleutian hunter of sea-otters thinks that he cannot kill a single  animal if during his absence from home his wife should be unfaithful  or his sister unchaste.    The Huichol Indians of Mexico treat as a demi-god a species of  cactus which throws the eater into a state of ecstasy. The plant  does not grow in their country, and has to be fetched every year by  men who make a journey of forty-three days for the purpose.  Meanwhile the wives at home contribute to the safety of their absent  husbands by never walking fast, much less running, while the men are  on the road. They also do their best to ensure the benefits which,  in the shape of rain, good crops, and so forth, are expected to flow  from the sacred mission. With this intention they subject themselves  to severe restrictions like those imposed upon their husbands.  During the whole of the time which elapses till the festival of the  cactus is held, neither party washes except on certain occasions,  and then only with water brought from the distant country where the  holy plant grows. They also fast much, eat no salt, and are bound to  strict continence. Any one who breaks this law is punished with  illness, and, moreover, jeopardises the result which all are  striving for. Health, luck, and life are to be gained by gathering  the cactus, the gourd of the God of Fire; but inasmuch as the pure  fire cannot benefit the impure, men and women must not only remain  chaste for the time being, but must also purge themselves from the  taint of past sin. Hence four days after the men have started the  women gather and confess to Grandfather Fire with what men they have  been in love from childhood till now. They may not omit a single  one, for if they did so the men would not find a single cactus. So  to refresh their memories each one prepares a string with as many  knots as she has had lovers. This she brings to the temple, and,  standing before the fire, she mentions aloud all the men she has  scored on her string, name after name. Having ended her confession,  she throws the string into"]]]
