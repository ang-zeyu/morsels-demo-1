We can only glance in passing at the literature of the Lost Cause, the  Loyalist or \"Tory\" pleadings for allegiance to Britain. It was written  by able and honest men, like Boucher and Odell, Seabury, Leonard and  Galloway. They distrusted what Seabury called \"our sovereign Lord the  Mob.\" They represented, in John Adams's opinion, nearly one-third of the  people of the colonies, and recent students believe that this estimate  was too low. In some colonies the Loyalists were clearly in the  majority. In all they were a menacing element, made up of the  conservative, the prosperous, the well-educated, with a mixture,  of course, of mere placemen and tuft-hunters. They composed weighty  pamphlets, eloquent sermons, and sparkling satire in praise of the old  order of things. When their cause was lost forever, they wrote gossipy  letters from their exile in London or pathetic verses in their new  home in Nova Scotia and Ontario. Their place in our national life and  literature has never been filled, and their talents and virtues are  never likely to receive adequate recognition. They took the wrong fork  of the road.    There were gentle spirits, too, in this period, endowed with  delicate literary gifts, but quite unsuited for the clash of  controversy--members, in Crevecoeur's touching words, of the \"secret  communion among good men throughout the world.\" \"I am a lover of peace,  what must I do?\" asks Crevecoeur in his \"Letters from an American  Farmer.\" \"I was happy before this unfortunate Revolution. I feel that I  am no longer so, therefore I regret the change. My heart sometimes seems  tired with beating, it wants rest like my eyelids, which feel oppressed  with so many watchings.\" Crevecoeur, an immigrant from Normandy, was  certainly no weakling, but he felt that the great idyllic American  adventure which he described so captivatingly in his chapter entitled  \"What is an American\"--was ending tragically in civil war. Another  whitesouled itinerant of that day was John Woolman of New Jersey, whose  \"Journal,\" praised by Charles Lamb and Channing and edited by Whittier,  is finding more readers in the twentieth century than it won in the  nineteenth. \"A man unlettered,\" said Whittier, \"but with natural  refinement and delicate sense of fitness, the purity of whose heart  enters into his language.\" Woolman died at fifty-two in far-away York,  England, whither he had gone to attend a meeting of the Society of  Friends.    The three tall volumes of the Princeton edition of the poems of Philip  Freneau bear the sub-title, \"Poet of the American Revolution.\" But our  Revolution, in truth, never had an adequate poet. The prose-men, such as  Jefferson, rose nearer the height of the great argument than did the  men of rhyme. Here and there the struggle inspired a brisk ballad like  Francis Hopkinson's \"Battle of the Kegs,\" a Hudibrastic satire like  Trumbull's \"McFingal,\" or a patriotic song like Timothy Dwight's  \"Columbia.\" Freneau painted from his own experience the horrors of the  British prison-ship, and celebrated, in cadences learned from Gray  and Collins, the valor of the men who fell at Eutaw Springs. There was  patriotic verse in extraordinary profusion, but its literary value is  slight, and it reveals few moods of the American mind that are not more  perfectly conveyed through oratory, the pamphlet, and the political  essay. The immediate models of this Revolutionary verse were the minor  British bards of the eighteenth century, a century greatly given to  verse-writing, but endowed by Heaven with the \"prose-reason\" mainly.  The reader of Burton E. Stevenson's collection of \"Poems of American  History\" can easily compare the contemporary verse inspired by the  events of the Revolution with the modern verse upon the same historic  themes. He will see how slenderly equipped for song were most of the  later eighteenth-century Americans and how unfavorable to poetry was the  tone of that hour.    Freneau himself suffered, throughout his long career, from the  depressing indifference of his public to the true spirit of poetry.  \"An old college mate of mine,\" said James Madison--who was by tradition  Freneau's roommate at Princeton in the class of 1771--\"a poet and man  of literary and refined tastes, knowing nothing of the world.\" When  but three years out of college, the cautious Madison wrote to another  friend: \"Poetry wit and Criticism Romances Plays &c captivated me much:  but I begin to discover that they deserve but a moderate portion of  a mortal's Time and that something more substantial more durable more  profitable befits our riper age.\" Madison was then at the ripe age of  twenty-three! Professor Pattee, Freneau's editor, quotes these words to  illustrate the \"common sense\" atmosphere of the age which proved fatal  to Freneau's development. Yet the sturdy young New Yorker, of Huguenot  descent, is a charming figure, and his later malevolence was shown only  to his political foes. After leaving Princeton he tries teaching,  the law, the newspaper, the sea; he is aflame with patriotic zeal; he  writes, like most American poets, far too much for his own reputation.  As the editor of the \"National Gazette\" in Philadelphia, he becomes  involved in the bitter quarrel between his chief, Jefferson, and  Alexander Hamilton. His attachment to the cause of the French Revolution  makes him publish baseless attacks upon Washington. By and by he retires  to a New Jersey farm, still toying with journalism, still composing  verses. He turns patriotic poet once more in the War of 1812; but the  public has now forgotten him. He lives on in poverty and seclusion,  and in his eightieth year loses his way in a snowstorm and perishes  miserably--this in 1832, the year of the death of the great Sir Walter  Scott, who once had complimented Freneau by borrowing one of his best  lines of poetry.    It is in the orations and pamphlets and state papers inspired by the  Revolutionary agitation that we find the most satisfactory expression  of the thought and feeling of that generation. Its typical literature is  civic rather than aesthetic, a sort of writing which has been incidental  to the accomplishing of some political, social, or moral purpose,  and which scarcely regards itself as literature at all. James Otis's  argument against the Writs of Assistance in Massachusetts in 1761, and  Patrick Henry's speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765, mark  epochs in the emotional life of these communities. They were reported  imperfectly or not at all, but they can no more be ignored in an  assessment of our national experience than editorials, sermons, or  conversations which have expressed the deepest feelings of a day and  then have perished beyond resurrection.    Yet if natural orators like Otis and Henry be denied a strictly  \"literary\" rating because their surviving words are obviously inadequate  to account for the popular effect of their speeches, it is still  possible to measure the efficiency of the pamphleteer. When John Adams  tells us that \"James Otis was Isaiah and Ezekiel united,\" we must take  his word for the impression which Otis's oratory left upon his mind.  But John Adams's own writings fill ten stout volumes which invite our  judgment. The \"truculent and sarcastic splendor\" of his hyperboles  need not blind us to his real literary excellencies, such as clearness,  candor, vigor of phrase, freshness of idea. A testy, rugged, \"difficult\"  person was John Adams, but he grew mellower with age, and his latest  letters and journals are full of whimsical charm.    John Adams's cousin Samuel was not precisely a charming person. Bigoted,  tireless, secretive, this cunning manipulator of political passions  followed many tortuous paths. His ability for adroit misstatement of an  adversary's position has been equaled but once in our history. But to  the casual reader of his four volumes, Samuel Adams seems ever to be  breathing the liberal air of the town-meeting: everything is as plainly  obvious as a good citizen can make it. He has, too, the large utterance  of the European liberalism of his day. \"Resolved,\" read his Resolutions  of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts in 1765, \"that there  are certain essential rights of the British constitution of government  which are founded in the law of God and nature and are the common rights  of mankind.\" In his statement of the Rights of the Colonists (1772) we  are assured that \"among the natural rights of the colonists are these,  First, a right to Life; secondly to Liberty; thirdly to Property....  All men have a Right to remain in a State of Nature as long as they  please... . When Men enter into Society, it is by voluntary consent.\"  Jean-Jacques himself could not be more bland, nor at heart more fiercely  demagogic.    \"Tom\" Paine would have been no match for \"Sam\" Adams in a town-meeting,  but he was an even greater pamphleteer. He had arrived from England in  1774, at the age of thirty-eight, having hitherto failed in most of  his endeavors for a livelihood. \"Rebellious Staymaker; unkempt,\" says  Carlyle; but General Charles Lee noted that there was \"genius in his  eyes,\" and he bore a letter of introduction from Franklin commending him  as an \"ingenious, worthy young man,\" which obtained for him a position  on the \"Pennsylvania Magazine.\" Before he had been a year on American  soil, Paine was writing the most famous pamphlet of our political  literature, \"Common Sense,\" which appeared in January, 1776. \"A style  hitherto unknown on this side of the Atlantic,\" wrote Edmund Randolph.  Yet this style of familiar talk to the crowd had been used seventy years  earlier by Defoe and Swift, and it was to be employed again by a gaunt  American frontiersman who was born in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#9)"],[1,"as many  poorly built. When properly built they will last for years, requiring  but little mending each fall at the opening of the trapping season.  Taken all in all we do not know that a certain number of deadfalls  take up any more time than an equal number of steel traps. In fact  more deadfalls can be set in a day, after they are built, than steel  traps.    When it is stated that you will perhaps do as well at home as  elsewhere, this, of course, depends upon where you are located, how  many trappers there are in your section, etc. If there is but little  to be caught then you had best go elsewhere, but trappers have been  known in thickly settled sections to catch from $50 to $300 worth of  fur in a season, lasting from November 1 to March 15. Of course in  the far north, where trapping can be carried on from October 15 to  June 15, or eight months, the catch is much larger, and as the  animals caught are more valuable, the catch of a single trapper is  sometimes as high as $600 to $1,000.    The trapper who stays near home has the advantage of knowing the  territory. If he was to visit a strange section, altho a good  trapping locality, he would not do so well as if he were acquainted  with the locality and knew the locations of the best dens. Then again  his expenses are heavier if he goes into a strange section, yet If  there is but little game near your home, and you are going to make a  business of trapping, go and look up a good trapping section. Under  these conditions it is best for two or three to go together. There is  no necessity of carrying but little baggage other than your gun, for  at the season of the year that prospecting is done there is but  little difficulty in killing enough game to live on.    After you have once found a good trapping section, and built your  cabin, deadfalls and snares, you can go there fall after fall with  your line of steel traps, resetting your deadfalls with but little  repairs for years. You will also become better acquainted with the  territory each season and will make larger catches. Do not think that  you have caught all the game the first season, for generally upon  your return the next fall you will find signs of game as numerous as  ever.    In locating new trapping grounds, if two or three are together and it  is a busy time in September, let one of the party go in advance  prospecting. This will save much valuable time when you make the  start for the fall and winter trapping campaign. It will pay you to  know where you are going before you make the final start.        CHAPTER XII.    WHERE TO BUILD.    In determining where to set deadfalls or locate snares if you will  keep in mind the dens where each winter you have caught fur-bearing  animals, or their tracks have often been seen in the snow or mud, and  build your traps and construct snares at or near such places you are  pretty sure to not go astray.    The location, of course, depends largely upon what kind of game you  are trying to catch. If mink or coon, there is no better place than  along streams where there are dens. If there should be a small branch  leading off from the main stream, at the mouth of this is often an  excellent place to locate a trap. It should not be too near the water  as a rise would damage or perhaps float off at least part of your  trap. Sometimes farther up this small stream there are bluffs and  rocks; at such places, if there are dens, is just the place to build  deadfalls. If there are several dens, and the bluff extends along  several hundred feet, it perhaps will pay to build two or three traps  here.    In cleared fields, woods or thickets skunk are found anywhere that  there are dens you can construct a trap. While, as a rule, the thinly  settled districts are the best trapping sections, yet skunk, muskrat  and red fox are found in greatest numbers in settled sections, while  opossum, raccoon and mink are found in fairly well settled districts.  It is therefore not necessary that you should go to the wilderness to  make fairly good catches. While the trapper in the wilderness has the  advantage of no one disturbing his deadfalls, yet he has  disadvantages. The trapper who means business need not go hundreds of  miles away, but if he will build a line of traps along some stream  where there are mink, or in the thickets and along rocky buffs for  skunk, raccoon, opossum, etc., he will be surprised at results.    In some sections land owners may not allow trapping, but usually they  will, especially if you take the pains to ask before you commence  building or setting your traps.    The fact that you have your traps scattered over a large territory  gives you better chances of making good catches, for most animals  travel quite a distance from night to night. You may have traps at  some stream that is eight or ten miles from your home and a mink may  come along that does most of its seeking for food miles farther up or  down this stream, nearer, perhaps, where it was raised, and you get  him. Thus you see by going only ten miles away you may catch animals  that really live twenty. Just how far a mink may travel up or down a  creek or river I do not know, but it is certain that they go many  miles and traps may make a catch of a mink that lives many, many  miles away. Of course along small streams they may not go so far.  Often, however, they continue their travels from one stream to  another.    If you are an expert trapper you can very easily detect, if you are  in a good locality, especially if in the fall--September and October.  These are the two months when the most prospecting is done. Going  along streams at this season tracks are plainly seen and in the  forests at dens signs, such as hair, bones and dung. Often you will  come upon signs where some bird has been devoured and you know that  some animal has been in the locality. Old trappers readily detect all  these signs and new ones can learn by experience.    It is not absolutely necessary to build traps at or near dens. Some  years ago, I remember when doing considerable trapping in Southern  Ohio, I came upon a deadfall built near a small stream that ran thru  a woods. I looked around for dens, but saw none. Why this trap had  been built there was a puzzle to me. One day I happened upon the  owner of the trap and asked him what he expected to catch in that  trap.    In reply he pointed to a bush some rods distant in which hung the  carcasses of two opossum and one coon--caught in the trap. While  there were no dens near, it was a favorite place for animals to cross  or else they came there for water. This same trap was the means of  this old trapper taking two or three animals each winter, while other  traps at dens near caught less. There is much in knowing where to set  traps, but keep your eyes open for signs and you will learn where to  build traps and set snares sooner or later.      * * *    Yes, boys, the deadfall is a splendid trap if made right, says an  Arkansas trapper. I will tell you how to make one that will catch  every mink and coon that runs the creek. Take a pole four feet long  and four inches through, next get a log six inches through and eight  feet long. Use eight stakes and two switches. Use the figure four  trigger, but the notches are cut different. Both of the notches are  cut on the top side of the long trigger and a notch cut in the  upright trigger and down the long trigger. The paddle part is sixteen  inches long. When the trap is set the paddle wants to be level and  one-half inch higher than small logs, then your two switches comes in  this to keep the paddle from hitting the bark on side logs.      [Illustration: TRAIL OR DEN TRAP.]    Next is where to set. If along a creek, find a place where the water  is within three feet of the bank, set your trap up and down the creek  at edge of water, dam up from back end of paddle to bank with brush  or briars, then from front end into water three or four feet. You  will find the upright trigger has to be a good deal longer than the  notch trigger. You can use round triggers if you want to by nailing a  shingle five inches wide on the long trigger stick. Be sure and have  your paddle muddy if setting along creeks. You want to put a little  stone back beyond paddle, so when the trap falls it will not burst  paddle. Now you have a trap easy made and sure to catch any animal  that steps on paddle, which is five inches wide and sixteen long. You  don't need any bait, but you can use bait by throwing it under  paddle. This trap is hard to beat for small game.      * * *    I make a deadfall that sets without bait, writes an Illinois trapper.  It is made like any other only different triggers. Set it across  path, over or in front of den or remove a rail and set it in the  corner of a fence where game goes thru. Use thread in dry weather,  fine wire for wet. Two logs for bottom is better than one, make  triggers high enough to suit the animal you wish to catch; if he hits  the string or wire he is yours.        CHAPTER XIII.    THE PROPER BAIT.    Bait is sometimes difficult to get, but usually the trapper will get  enough with his gun and steel traps to keep his line of deadfalls  well baited, without difficulty. In trapping, all animals caught  after the pelt is taken off should be hung up so that other animals  cannot reach them, but will visit your traps.    There are two objects in hanging up bait: First, other animals coming  along are apt to eat them and not visit your deadfall; second, should  you run out of bait you can cut a piece from the animal hanging up,  bait your trap and go to the next. While bait of this kind is not  recommended, sometimes it comes to this or nothing. Fresh bait is  what is wanted at all times, yet the trapper cannot always get what  he knows is best and consequently must do the next best. Perhaps by  his next visit he has bait in abundance.    The writer has known trappers to use a piece of "]]]
