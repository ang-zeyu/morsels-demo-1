[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3800"],[0,"Ethics (#9)"],[1," For instance, if the motion which  objects we see communicate to our nerves be conducive to health,  the objects causing it are styled beautiful; if a contrary  motion be excited, they are styled ugly.    Things which are perceived through our sense of smell are  styled fragrant or fetid; if through our taste, sweet or bitter,  full--flavored or insipid; if through our touch, hard or soft,  rough or smooth, &c.    Whatsoever affects our ears is said to give rise to noise,  sound, or harmony.  In this last case, there are men lunatic  enough to believe, that even God himself takes pleasure in  harmony; and philosophers are not lacking who have persuaded  themselves, that the motion of the heavenly bodies gives rise to  harmony--all of which instances sufficiently show that everyone  judges of things according to the state of his brain, or rather  mistakes for things the forms of his imagination.  We need no  longer wonder that there have arisen all the controversies we  have witnessed, and finally skepticism: for, although human  bodies in many respects agree, yet in very many others they  differ; so that what seems good to one seems bad to another;  what seems well ordered to one seems confused to another; what  is pleasing to one displeases another, and so on.  I need not  further enumerate, because this is not the place to treat the  subject at length, and also because the fact is sufficiently well  known.  It is commonly said: \"So many men, so many minds;  everyone is wise in his own way; brains differ as completely as  palates.\"  All of which proverbs show, that men judge of things  according to their mental disposition, and rather imagine than  understand: for, if they understood phenomena, they would, as  mathematicians attest, be convinced, if not attracted, by what I  have urged.    We have now perceived, that all the explanations commonly  given of nature are mere modes of imagining, and do not indicate  the true nature of anything, but only the constitution of the  imagination; and, although they have names, as though they were  entities, existing externally to the imagination, I call them  entities imaginary rather than real; and, therefore, all  arguments against us drawn from such abstractions are easily  rebutted.    Many argue in this way.  If all things follow from a  necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there  so many imperfections in nature? such, for instance, as things  corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity,  confusion, evil, sin, &c.  But these reasoners are, as I have  said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be  reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not  more or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human  senses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to  mankind.  To those who ask why God did not so create all men,  that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but  this: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of  every degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more  strictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to  suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an  infinite intelligence, as I have shown in Prop. xvi.    Such are the misconceptions I have undertaken to note; if  there are any more of the same sort, everyone may easily  dissipate them for himself with the aid of a little reflection.          Part II.    ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND      PREFACE        I now pass on to explaining the results, which must  necessarily follow from the essence of God, or of the eternal and  infinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in Part  i., Prop. xvi., that an infinite number must follow in an  infinite number of ways), but only those which are able to lead  us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind  and its highest blessedness.      DEFINITIONS    DEFINITION I.  By body I mean a mode which expresses in a certain  determinate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is  considered as an extended thing.  (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv.,  Coroll.)    DEFINITION II.  I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing  that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also,  and, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also;  in other words, that without which the thing, and which itself  without the thing, can neither be nor be conceived.    DEFINITION III. By idea, I mean the mental conception which is  formed by the mind as a thinking thing.    Explanation.--I say conception rather than perception, because  the word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in  respect to the object; whereas conception seems to express an  activity of the mind.    DEFINITION IV.  By an adequate idea, I mean an idea which, in so  far as it is considered in itself, without relation to the  object, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.    Explanation.--I say intrinsic, in order to exclude that mark  which is extrinsic, namely, the agreement between the idea and  its object (ideatum).    DEFINITION V.  Duration is the indefinite continuance of  existing.    Explanation.--I say indefinite, because it cannot be  determined through the existence itself of the existing thing, or  by its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the existence of  the thing, but does not take it away.    DEFINITION VI.  Reality and perfection I use as synonymous terms.    DEFINITION VII.  By particular things, I mean things which are  finite and have a conditioned existence; but if several  individual things concur in one action, so as to be all  simultaneously the effect of one cause, I consider them all, so  far, as one particular thing.      AXIOMS    I.  The essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that  is, it may, in the order of nature, come to pass that this or  that man does or does not exist.    II.  Man thinks.    III.  Modes of thinking, such as love, desire, or any other of  the passions, do not take place, unless there be in the same  individual an idea of the thing loved, desired, &c.  But the idea  can exist without the presence of any other mode of thinking.    IV.  We perceive that a certain body is affected in many ways.    V.  We feel and perceive no particular things, save bodies and  modes of thought.    N.B.  The Postulates are given after the conclusion of Prop.  xiii.      PROPOSITIONS    PROP. I.  Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking  thing.    Proof.--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are  modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature  of God (Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Coroll.).  God therefore possesses  the attribute (Pt. i., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved  in all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby.  Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God,  which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Pt. i., Def.  vi.).  In other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.    Note.--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we  are able to conceive an infinite thinking being.  For, in  proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more  thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or  perfection.  Therefore a being, which can think an infinite  number of things in an infinite number of ways, is, necessarily,  in respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore, from the  consideration of thought alone, we conceive an infinite being,  thought is necessarily (Pt. i., Deff. iv. and vi.) one of the  infinite attributes of God, as we were desirous of showing.    PROP. II.  Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an  extended thing.    Proof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of  the last.    PROP. III.  In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his  essence, but also of all things which necessarily follow from his  essence.    Proof.--God (by the first Prop. of this Part) can think an  infinite number of things in infinite ways, or (what is the same  thing, by Prop. xvi., Part i.) can form the idea of his essence,  and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all  that is in the power of God necessarily is (Pt. i., Prop. xxxv.).  Therefore, such an idea as we are considering necessarily is, and  in God alone.  Q.E.D.  (Part i., Prop. xv.)    Note.--The multitude understand by the power of God the free  will of God, and the right over all things that exist, which  latter are accordingly generally considered as contingent.  For  it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to  reduce them to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often  likened to the power of kings.  But this doctrine we have refuted  (Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Corolls. i. and ii.), and we have shown  (Part i., Prop. xvi.) that God acts by the same necessity, as  that by which he understands himself; in other words, as it  follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit),  that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same  necessity, that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We  further showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that God's power is  identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as  impossible for us to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive  him as non--existent.  If we might pursue the subject further, I  could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to  God is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the  multitude as a man, or in the likeness of a man), but involves a  negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over the same  ground so often.  I would only beg the reader again and again, to  turn over frequently in his mind what I have said in Part I from  Prop. xvi. to the end.  No one will be able to follow my meaning,  unless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power of  God with the human power and right of kings."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38003"],[0,"Color Key to North American Birds (#9)"],[1,"from Nova Scotia to Greenland; winters south to Great Lakes and South  Carolina.
