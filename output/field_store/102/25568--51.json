Here, again, the proper vowel  production must be sought for, and obtained. The difficulties will be  varied in this respect with the locality. Often I have met with  doh-_oo_. This, as well as ray-_ee_, and other faults that need not be  specified, can be corrected at once. The beautiful intonation we had at  Swanley I attribute in a large measure to the care bestowed on the  production of vowel sounds. There must be no division of opinion among  the singers as to how any particular vowel sound should be emitted. If  there be not unity in this respect the intonation suffers.    The earlier exercises should be sung in unison, a correct division into  1st, 2nd, and 3rd trebles being impossible until the boys have acquired  sufficient confidence to show _what_ they are naturally. I have for a  long time used with advantage the single chant form for exercises,  making them myself.    [Illustration: KEY F. {|d1:-|l:t |d1:-||d1:-|t:1 |s:t |d1:-||]    In order to avoid waste of time in learning exercises they should be  _short_, so that they can be caught up at once.    To get boys to sing in the register below (the Lower Thin) is the next  step, the exercises now being confined between [Illustration: musical  notation] and formed in the same way as those in the higher region. The  difficulty is greater in getting rough boys to use this part of the  vocal score correctly. The best way I have found to get them to  discover it, is to sing [Illustration: KEY F. s f m r d]--beginning at  C1, to koo. The notes are at first weak, and there is a tendency to  \"squork,\" if I may so term it. These exercises must be sung softly at  first, and at this stage the schoolmaster can render valuable help if he  will get his boys to read from their lesson books in this register  instead of in the one below it.    I have to acknowledge a debt of gratitude to one of our best and most  painstaking teachers for giving me this hint. The reading will at first  be weak, and in a monotone, and there being no flexibility, the boys  will have difficulty in forming the usual cadence at the end of  sentences, but practice will soon strengthen the weakness, and make this  register as strong as the one below it. Between the one above and the  one below, this \"middle\" one is apt to be overlooked altogether, and I  have heard some fairly pleasing singing where it has not been recognised  at all.    The third register (Upper Thick) should now receive attention, and in  order to find it the pupils should cultivate it upwards with such  exercises as--    [Illustration: &c.    KEY A[b]. d_1 r_1 d_1 d_1 r_1 m_1 &c.    Koo koo koo koo koo koo]    Within the limits of a short paper, it is impossible to give more fully  all the needful directions for training the voices to cover up breaks,  and to change from one register to another.    Suitable tunes should now be selected, so that the aim of the exercises  may be extended. Remember that it is easiest to _leap_ from one register  to a higher, a stepwise ascent being an insidious snare. Koo and  afterwards laa such tunes as:--    [Illustration: KEY C.    {| s:m |d1:s |m1:-.r1|d1:s |l:l |s:d1 |s:f |m:-||    KEY E[b].    {|m:r |f:m |r:-|m:-||l:s |t:d1 |s:-|f:-||    {|m:r |f:m |r:-|l:-||d1:s |m:r |d:-|-:-||]    Many ready-made exercises are to be found in any chant book, which can  be used to strengthen the voice and build it. For voice exercise I like  a high reciting note at the beginning, D1, C1, E[b]1, as by this we  ensure getting the right register for the high notes, which will be a  matter of doubt for some time if the question of suitability of melody  be left out of calculation.    I strongly recommend the use of the time names. For some years I was  prejudiced against them, but after trying them, believe them to be of  the greatest value.    The teacher should give manual signs for his short exercises. Time is  wasted unnecessarily if the teacher has to turn and write on the board.  The objection to working through a book, only using prescribed  exercises, is chiefly this--no book writer can provide for all the  permutations and combinations that may arise during the actual work of  teaching; it is impossible for him to anticipate them. This does not in  the least detract from the value of the book, which must be the best  _general_ guide for by far the larger part of our teachers.    I have referred to the teaching of vowel sounds, and would say a word  about consonants. My practice has been to guard against giving undue  prominence to any individual letter, and to encourage always a _simple  unaffected utterance_ in singing. Rolling \"r's\" is very well, but to  precede the vowel with a sound not unlike the noise caused by springing  a police rattle is neither artistic nor pleasing. My custom was to first  let the pupils sing a vowel, say _aa_, and require it to be held on as  long as my hand was still. A sharp movement of the hand directed when  the consonant should appear, as _aa--t_, &c., the appearance and  disappearance being as close together as possible. It is a difficulty  with beginners to sing such words as \"night,\" \"bright,\" &c., holding on  the middle part, or vowel. I demonstrated that the singer has nothing  left to sing after having too soon disposed of the vowel. I also gave  exercises in prefixing a consonant to a vowel. Other points of detail  will arise, such as in the word \"sing.\" The habit here is to make the  \"ng\" sound throughout the greater part of the durance of the singing of  the word. By analysing, and showing by copying the bad model, the  teacher will convince the pupil that \"ng\" held on is unpleasant. In  singing laa, laa, laa, &c., at first pupils lower and raise the jaw.  This should be at once stopped. But it is impossible to anticipate every  difficulty that will arise under this head. I have said enough to  indicate generally my method. I do not propose to enter into the  question of breathing. One thing I would say--do not try pupils by  requiring them to sing long notes at first, but do get them at the  beginning to \"phrase\" to your pattern. This will from the first get the  will to control the breath taking.    By all means introduce certificates. By the examination of individuals,  the teacher will get truer knowledge of his learners' powers, and will  be enabled to give advice of greater value because of its assured need.  Let the examination be in public--before the other pupils--and so help  to beget confidence in the pupil, without which success will be limited.  The teacher should never do anything to destroy the confidence of his  pupils, though I am bound to admit that I have not always been free from  irritability and impatience in my dealings with pupils. The work is  trying, the nerves of a teacher of singing are throughout highly  strung, and very little cause is necessary to upset his equilibrium. He  should therefore be ever on his guard to check any tendency to show  impatience.    Never get a pupil to sing alone for the sake of showing his defects to  others. No one can _sing_ who does not possess a sense of his power to  do so. There should be encouraged an _abandon_ sort of manner. A  gentleman once said to me, \"I see how you make your boys sing; you tell  them they can do it, and that makes them do it.\" The rigid watching of  the beat of the conductor should not be too closely insisted on. No  machine-like singing should satisfy, even though it be _correct_. The  correctness of a great painter's production is not everything, and  neither is it with the singer. There should an atmosphere of the liberty  of freedom.    At Swanley my work was lessened by the interest that all my colleagues  took in it. A moral force was constantly brought to bear on the boys,  which made them work with a will and a determination to excel. Their  success was the same in other departments of work, though not so  prominently placed. The music teacher who has in himself the power to  draw out the latent feeling of his pupils is the one who will best  succeed. I would draw my remarks to a close with this advice:--Make your  choir as large as possible. Take all who will come into it, and do not  go through the form of \"trying\" voices that have never tried themselves,  and of which you can form no opinion. For adults this is a necessity,  but for children it is better to get one or two per cent. of naturally  defective learners, rather than to turn away all but those showing  undoubtedly exceptional ability.          CHAPTER X.    THE SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.      My object is to help those whose difficulties are greatest; who, so far  from being able to pick out boys of musical talent and fine voice, are  obliged to accept the material that offers, often of the poorest musical  description. The country boy is a more healthy animal than his brother  of the town, and there is no fault to be found with the natural volume  of his voice provided he can be taught to place his registers rightly,  to avoid straining the thick or chest register, to pronounce and phrase  properly. This is, however, what the Americans call \"a large order.\"    I have been fortunate in collecting information from several  choirmasters in agricultural districts, who have conquered the  difficulties of this task. First, I quote Mr. W. Critchley, choirmaster  and schoolmaster at Hurst, near Reading:--    \"The rural choir-boy differs somewhat from his brethren of the town in  the following particulars. As a rule, he is duller, and slower in his  perception; he is attentive and docile, but sluggish; he retains what he  is taught, and therefore, as far as mere knowledge and memory are  concerned, it 'pays' to take him in hand. His voice is strong, but  rough, and this undisciplined strength is the cause of most of the  trouble he gives. Moreover, he is exposed to the weather very largely,  and this causes "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032"],[0,"Second Variety (#9)"],[1,"y. If  anything happened. If the bunker fell.\"    \"That was you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where is the ship? Is it here?\"    \"We're standing on it.\" Hendricks ran his hands over the surface of  the well stones. \"The eye-lock responds to me, not to anybody else.  It's my ship. Or it was supposed to be.\"    There was a sharp click. Presently they heard a low grating sound from  below them.    \"Step back,\" Hendricks said. He and Tasso moved away from the well.    A section of the ground slid back. A metal frame pushed slowly up  through the ash, shoving bricks and weeds out of the way. The action  ceased, as the ship nosed into view.    \"There it is,\" Hendricks said.    The ship was small. It rested quietly, suspended in its mesh frame,  like a blunt needle. A rain of ash sifted down into the dark cavity  from which the ship had been raised. Hendricks made his way over to  it. He mounted the mesh and unscrewed the hatch, pulling it back.  Inside the ship the control banks and the pressure seat were visible.           *       *       *       *       *    Tasso came and stood beside him, gazing into the ship. \"I'm not  accustomed to rocket piloting,\" she said, after awhile.    Hendricks glanced at her. \"I'll do the piloting.\"    \"Will you? There's only one seat, Major. I can see it's built to carry  only a single person.\"    Hendricks' breathing changed. He studied the interior of the ship  intently. Tasso was right. There was only one seat. The ship was built  to carry only one person. \"I see,\" he said slowly. \"And the one person  is you.\"    She nodded.    \"Of course.\"    \"Why?\"    \"_You_ can't go. You might not live through the trip. You're injured.  You probably wouldn't get there.\"    \"An interesting point. But you see, I know where the Moon Base is. And  you don't. You might fly around for months and not find it. It's well  hidden. Without knowing what to look for--\"    \"I'll have to take my chances. Maybe I won't find it. Not by myself.  But I think you'll give me all the information I need. Your life  depends on it.\"    \"How?\"    \"If I find the Moon Base in time, perhaps I can get them to send a  ship back to pick you up. _If_ I find the Base in time. If not, then  you haven't a chance. I imagine there are supplies on the ship. They  will last me long enough--\"    Hendricks moved quickly. But his injured arm betrayed him. Tasso  ducked, sliding lithely aside. Her hand came up, lightning fast.  Hendricks saw the gun butt coming. He tried to ward off the blow, but  she was too fast. The metal butt struck against the side of his head,  just above his ear. Numbing pain rushed through him. Pain and rolling  clouds of blackness. He sank down, sliding to the ground.           *       *       *       *       *    Dimly, he was aware that Tasso was standing over him, kicking him with  her toe.    \"Major! Wake up.\"    He opened his eyes, groaning.    \"Listen to me.\" She bent down, the gun pointed at his face. \"I have to  hurry. There isn't much time left. The ship is ready to go, but you  must tell me the information I need before I leave.\"    Hendricks shook his head, trying to clear it.    \"Hurry up! Where is the Moon Base? How do I find it? What do I look  for?\"    Hendricks said nothing.    \"Answer me!\"    \"Sorry.\"    \"Major, the ship is loaded with provisions. I can coast for weeks.  I'll find the Base eventually. And in a half hour you'll be dead. Your  only chance of survival--\" She broke off.    Along the slope, by some crumbling ruins, something moved. Something  in the ash. Tasso turned quickly, aiming. She fired. A puff of flame  leaped. Something scuttled away, rolling across the ash. She fired  again. The claw burst apart, wheels flying.    \"See?\" Tasso said. \"A scout. It won't be long.\"    \"You'll bring them back here to get me?\"    \"Yes. As soon as possible.\"    Hendricks looked up at her. He studied her intently. \"You're telling  the truth?\" A strange expression had come over his face, an avid  hunger. \"You will come back for me? You'll get me to the Moon Base?\"    \"I'll get you to the Moon Base. But tell me where it is! There's only  a little time left.\"    \"All right.\" Hendricks picked up a piece of rock, pulling himself to a  sitting position. \"Watch.\"    Hendricks began to scratch in the ash. Tasso stood by him, watching  the motion of the rock. Hendricks was sketching a crude lunar map.           *       *       *       *       *    \"This is the Appenine range. Here is the Crater of Archimedes. The  Moon Base is beyond the end of the Appenine, about two hundred miles.  I don't know exactly where. No one on Terra knows. But when you're  over the Appenine, signal with one red flare and a green flare,  followed by two red flares in quick succession. The Base monitor will  record your signal. The Base is under the surface, of course. They'll  guide you down with magnetic grapples.\"    \"And the controls? Can I operate them?\"    \"The controls are virtually automatic. All you have to do is give the  right signal at the right time.\"    \"I will.\"    \"The seat absorbs most of the take-off shock. Air and temperature are  automatically controlled. The ship will leave Terra and pass out into  free space. It'll line itself up with the moon, falling into an orbit  around it, about a hundred miles above the surface. The orbit will  carry you over the Base. When you're in the region of the Appenine,  release the signal rockets.\"    Tasso slid into the ship and lowered herself into the pressure seat.  The arm locks folded automatically around her. She fingered the  controls. \"Too bad you're not going, Major. All this put here for you,  and you can't make the trip.\"    \"Leave me the pistol.\"    Tasso pulled the pistol from her belt. She held it in her hand,  weighing it thoughtfully. \"Don't go too far from this location. It'll  be hard to find you, as it is.\"    \"No. I'll stay here by the well.\"    Tasso gripped the take-off switch, running her fingers over the smooth  metal. \"A beautiful ship, Major. Well built. I admire your  workmanship. You people have always done good work. You build fine  things. Your work, your creations, are your greatest achievement.\"    \"Give me the pistol,\" Hendricks said impatiently, holding out his  hand. He struggled to his feet.    \"Good-bye, Major.\" Tasso tossed the pistol past Hendricks. The pistol  clattered against the ground, bouncing and rolling away. Hendricks  hurried after it. He bent down, snatching it up.    The hatch of the ship clanged shut. The bolts fell into place.  Hendricks made his way back. The inner door was being sealed. He  raised the pistol unsteadily.           *       *       *       *       *    There was a shattering roar. The ship burst up from its metal cage,  fusing the mesh behind it. Hendricks cringed, pulling back. The ship  shot up into the rolling clouds of ash, disappearing into the sky.    Hendricks stood watching a long time, until even the streamer had  dissipated. Nothing stirred. The morning air was chill and silent. He  began to walk aimlessly back the way they had come. Better to keep  moving around. It would be a long time before help came--if it came at  all.    He searched his pockets until he found a package of cigarettes. He lit  one grimly. They had all wanted cigarettes from him. But cigarettes  were scarce.    A lizard slithered by him, through the ash. He halted, rigid. The  lizard disappeared. Above, the sun rose higher in the sky. Some flies  landed on a flat rock to one side of him. Hendricks kicked at them  with his foot.    It was getting hot. Sweat trickled down his face, into his collar. His  mouth was dry.    Presently he stopped walking and sat down on some debris. He  unfastened his medicine kit and swallowed a few narcotic capsules. He  looked around him. Where was he?    Something lay ahead. Stretched out on the ground. Silent and unmoving.    Hendricks drew his gun quickly. It looked like a man. Then he  remembered. It was the remains of Klaus. The Second Variety. Where  Tasso had blasted him. He could see wheels and relays and metal parts,  strewn around on the ash. Glittering and sparkling in the sunlight.    Hendricks got to his feet and walked over. He nudged the inert form  with his foot, turning it over a little. He could see the metal hull,  the aluminum ribs and struts. More wiring fell out. Like viscera.  Heaps of wiring, switches and relays. Endless motors and rods.    He bent down. The brain cage had been smashed by the fall. The  artificial brain was visible. He gazed at it. A maze of circuits.  Miniature tubes. Wires as fine as hair. He touched the brain cage. It  swung aside. The type plate was visible. Hendricks studied the plate.    And blanched.    IV--IV.    For a long time he stared at the plate. Fourth Variety. Not the  Second. They had been wrong. There were more types. Not just three.  Many more, perhaps. At least four. And Klaus wasn't the Second  Variety.    But if Klaus wasn't the Second Variety--    Suddenly he tensed. Something was coming, walking through the ash  beyond the hill. What was it? He strained to see. Figures. Figures  coming slowly along, making their way through the ash.    Coming toward him.    Hendricks crouched quickly, raising his gun. Sweat dripped down into  his eyes. He fought down rising panic, as the figures neared.    The first was a David. The David saw him and increased its pace. The  others hurried behind it. A second David. A third. Three Davids, all  alike, coming toward him silently, without expression, their thin legs  rising and falling. Clutching their teddy bears.    He aimed and fired. The first two Davids dissolved into particles. The  third came on. And the figure behind it. Climbing silently toward him  across the gray ash. A Wounded Soldier, towering over the David. And--           *       *       *       *       *    And behind the Wounded Soldier came two Tassos, walking side by side.  Heavy belt, Russian army pants, shirt, long hair.
