If the          sinner's punishment here has been insufficient to re-          form him, the good man's heaven would be a hell to  36:1    the sinner. They, who know not purity and affection by          experience, can never find bliss in the blessed company of  36:3    Truth and Love simply through translation          into another sphere. Divine Science reveals          the necessity of sufficient suffering, either before or after  36:6    death, to quench the love of sin. To remit the penalty          due for sin, would be for Truth to pardon error. Escape          from punishment is not in accordance with God's govern-  36:9    ment, since justice is the handmaid of mercy.            Jesus endured the shame, that he might pour his          dear-bought bounty into barren lives. What was his  36:12   earthly reward? He was forsaken by all save John,          the beloved disciple, and a few women who bowed in          silent woe beneath the shadow of his cross. The earthly  36:15   price of spirituality in a material age and the great moral          distance between Christianity and sensualism preclude          Christian Science from finding favor with the worldly-  36:18   minded.                              Righteous retribution            A selfish and limited mind may be unjust, but the un-          limited and divine Mind is the immortal law of justice as  36:21   well as of mercy. It is quite as impossible for          sinners to receive their full punishment this          side of the grave as for this world to bestow on the right-  36:24   eous their full reward. It is useless to suppose that the          wicked can gloat over their offences to the last moment          and then be suddenly pardoned and pushed into heaven,  36:27   or that the hand of Love is satisfied with giving us only          toil, sacrifice, cross-bearing, multiplied trials, and mock-          ery of our motives in return for our efforts at well doing.                               Vicarious suffering    36:30   Religious history repeats itself in the suf-          fering of the just for the unjust. Can God          therefore overlook the law of righteousness which de-  37:1    stroys the belief called sin? Does not Science show that          sin brings suffering as much to-day as yesterday? They  37:3    who sin must suffer. \"With what measure ye mete, it          shall be measured to you again.\"                               Martyrs inevitable            History is full of records of suffering. \"The blood of  37:6    the martyrs is the seed of the Church.\" Mortals try in          vain to slay Truth with the steel or the stake,          but error falls only before the sword of Spirit.  37:9    Martyrs are the human links which connect one stage with          another in the history of religion. They are earth's lumi-          naries, which serve to cleanse and rarefy the atmosphere of  37:12   material sense and to permeate humanity with purer ideals.          Consciousness of right-doing brings its own reward; but          not amid the smoke of battle is merit seen and appreciated  37:15   by lookers-on.                               Complete emulation            When will Jesus' professed followers learn to emulate          him in /all/ his ways and to imitate his mighty works?  37:18   Those who procured the martyrdom of that          righteous man would gladly have turned his          sacred career into a mutilated doctrinal platform. May  37:21   the Christians of to-day take up the more practical im-          port of that career! It is possible, - yea, it is the duty          and privilege of every child, man, and woman, - to follow  37:24   in some degree the example of the Master by the demon-          stration of Truth and Life, of health and holiness. Chris-          tians claim to be his followers, but do they follow him in  37:27   the way that he commanded? Hear these imperative com-          mands: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father          which is in heaven is perfect!\" \"Go ye into all the world,  37:30   and preach the gospel to every creature!\" \"/Heal the          sick/!\"                            Jesus' teaching belittled            Why has this Christian demand so little inspiration  38:1    to stir mankind to Christian effort? Because men are          assured that this command was intended only for a par-  38:3    ticular period and for a select number of fol-          lowers. This teaching is even more pernicious          than the old doctrine of foreordination, - the election of a  38:6    few to be saved, while the rest are damned; and so it will          be considered, when the lethargy of mortals, produced          by man-made doctrines, is broken by the demands of  38:9    divine Science.            Jesus said: \"These signs shall follow them that be-          lieve; . . . they shall lay hands on the sick, and they  38:12   shall recover.\" Who believes him? He was addressing          his disciples, yet he did not say, \" These signs shall follow          /you/,\" but /them/- \"them that believe\" in all time to come.  38:15   Here the word /hands/ is used metaphorically, as in the text,          \"The right hand of the Lord is exalted.\" It expresses          spiritual power; otherwise the healing could not have  38:18   been done spiritually. At another time Jesus prayed, not          for the twelve only, but for as many as should believe          \"through their word.\"                               Material pleasures    38:21   Jesus experienced few of the pleasures of the physical          senses, but his sufferings were the fruits of other peo-          ple's sins, not of his own. The eternal Christ,  38:24   his spiritual selfhood, never suffered. Jesus          mapped out the path for others. He unveiled the Christ,          the spiritual idea of divine Love. To those buried in the  38:27   belief of sin and self, living only for pleasure or the grati-          fication of the senses, he said in substance: Having eyes          ye see not, and having ears ye hear not; lest ye should un-  38:30   derstand and be converted, and I might heal you. He          taught that the material senses shut out Truth and its          healing power.                                Mockery of truth    39:1    Meekly our Master met the mockery of his unrecog-          nized grandeur. Such indignities as he received, his fol-  39:3    lowers will endure until Christianity's last          triumph. He won eternal honors. He over-          came the world, the flesh, and all error, thus proving  39:6    their nothingness. He wrought a full salvation from sin,          sickness, and death. We need \"Christ, and him cruci-          fied.\" We must have trials and self-denials, as well as  39:9    joys and victories, until all error is destroyed.                                A belief suicidal            The educated belief that Soul is in the body causes          mortals to regard death as a friend, as a stepping-stone  39:12   out of mortality into immortality and bliss.          The Bible calls death an enemy, and Jesus          overcame death and the grave instead of yielding to them.  39:15   He was \"the way.\" To him, therefore, death was not          the threshold over which he must pass into living          glory.                                Present salvation    39:18   \"/Now/,\" cried the apostle, \"is the accepted time; be-          hold, /now/ is the day of salvation,\" - meaning, not that          now men must prepare for a future-world salva-  39:21   tion, or safety, but that now is the time in which          to experience that salvation in spirit and in life. Now is          the time for so-called material pains and material pleas-  39:24   ures to pass away, for both are unreal, because impossible          in Science. To break this earthly spell, mortals must get          the true idea and divine Principle of all that really exists  39:27   and governs the universe harmoniously. This thought is          apprehended slowly, and the interval before its attain-          ment is attended with doubts and defeats as well as  39:30   triumphs.                                 Sin and penalty            Who will stop the practice of sin so long as he believes          in the pleasures of sin? When mortals once admit that  40:1    evil confers no pleasure, they turn from it. Remove error          from thought, and it will not appear in effect. The ad-  40:3    vanced thinker and devout Christian, perceiv-          ing the scope and tendency of Christian healing          and its Science, will support them. Another will say:  40:6    \"Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient          season I will call for thee.\"            Divine Science adjusts the balance as Jesus adjusted  40:9    it. Science removes the penalty only by first removing          the sin which incurs the penalty. This is my sense of          divine pardon, which I understand to mean God's method  40:12   of destroying sin. If the saying is true, \"While there's          life there's hope,\" its opposite is also true, While there's          sin there's doom. Another's suffering cannot lessen our  40:15   own liability. Did the martyrdom of Savonarola make          the crimes of his implacable enemies less criminal?                              Suffering inevitable            Was it just for Jesus to suffer? No; but it was  40:18   inevitable, for not otherwise could he show us the way          and the power of Truth. If a career so great          and good as that of Jesus could not avert a  40:21   felon's fate, lesser apostles of Truth may endure human          brutality without murmuring, rejoicing to enter into          fellowship with him through the triumphal arch of  40:24   Truth and Love.                               Service and worship            "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#9)"],[1," great merit, for the times in which he  flourished; and being placed at Perugia, under Pietro, he soon became  master of his style, as Vasari observes, and had then probably already  formed the design of excelling him. I was informed in Citta di Castello,  that at the age of seventeen he painted the picture of S. Nicholas of  Tolentino in the church of the Eremitani. The style was that of  Perugino, but the composition differed from that of the age, being the  throne of our Saviour surrounded by saints. The Beato (beatified saint)  is there represented, while the Virgin and St. Augustine, concealed in  part by a cloud, bind his temples with a crown; there are two angels at  the right hand, and two at the left, graceful, and in different  attitudes; with inscriptions variously folded, on which are inscribed  some words in praise of S. Eremitano. Above is the Eternal Father  surrounded by a majestic choir of angels. The actors of the scene appear  to be in a temple, the pillars of which are ornamented in the minute and  laboured style of Mantegna, and the ancient manner is still perceptible  in the folds of the drapery, though there is an evident improvement in  the design, as in the figure of Satan, who lies under the feet of the  saint. This figure is free from the singular deformity with which the  ancient painters represented him; and has the genuine features of an  Ethiopian. To this picture another of this period may be added in the  church of S. Domenico; a Crucifixion, with two attendant angels; the one  receives in a cup the sacred blood which flows from the right hand, the  other, in two cups, collects that of the left hand and the side; the  weeping mother and disciples contribute their aid, while the Magdalen  and an aged saint kneeling in silence contemplate the solemn mystery;  above is the Deity. These figures might all pass for those of Pietro,  except the Virgin, the beauty of which he never equalled, unless perhaps  in the latter part of his life. Another specimen of this period is  noticed by the Abate Morcelli, (de Stylo Inscript. Latin, p. 476). He  states, that in the possession of Sig. Annibale Maggiori, a nobleman of  Fermo, he saw the picture of a Madonna, raising with both hands a veil  of delicate texture from the holy Infant, as he lies in a cradle asleep.  Nigh at hand is S. Joseph, whose eyes rest in contemplation on the happy  scene, and on his staff the same writer detected an inscription in  extremely minute characters, R. S. V. A. A. XVII. P. _Raphael Sanctius  Urbinas an. aetatis 17 pinxit_. This must have been the first attempt of  the design which he perfected at a more mature age, and which is in the  Treasury of Loreto, where the holy Infant is represented, not in the act  of sleeping, but gracefully stretching out his hand to the Virgin: of  the same epoch I judge the _tondini_ to be, which I shall describe in  the course of a few pages, when I refer to the Madonna della Seggiola.    Vasari informs us, that before executing these two pictures, he had  already painted in Perugia an Assumption in the church of the  Conventuals, with three subjects from the life of Christ in the grado;  which may however be doubted, as it is a more perfect work. This picture  possesses all the best parts of the style of Vannucci; but the varied  expressions which the apostles discover on finding the sepulchre void,  are beyond the reach of that artist's powers. Raffaello still further  excelled his master, as Vasari observes, in the third picture painted  for Citta di Castello. This is the marriage of the Virgin, in the church  of S. Francesco. The composition very much resembles that which he  adopted in a picture of the same subject in Perugia; but there is  sufficient of modern art in it to indicate the commencement of a new  style. The two espoused have a degree of beauty which Raffaello scarcely  surpassed in his mature age, in any other countenances. The Virgin  particularly is a model of celestial beauty. A youthful band festively  adorned accompany her to her espousals; splendour vies with elegance;  the attitudes are engaging, the veils variously arranged, and there is a  mixture of ancient and modern drapery, which at so early a period cannot  be considered as a fault. In the midst of these accompaniments the  principal figure triumphantly appears, not ornamented by the hand of  art, but distinguished by her native nobility, beauty, modesty, and  grace. The first sight of this performance strikes us with astonishment,  and we involuntarily exclaim, how divine and noble the spirit that  animates her heavenly form! The group of the men of the party of S.  Joseph are equally well conceived. In these figures we see nothing of  the stiffness of the drapery, the dryness of execution, and the peculiar  style of Pietro, which sometimes approaches to harshness: all is action,  and an animating spirit breathes in every gesture and in every  countenance. The landscapes are not represented with sterile and  impoverished trees, as in the backgrounds of Pietro; but are drawn from  nature, and finished with care. The round temple in the summit is  ornamented with columns, and executed, Vasari observes, with such  admirable art, that it is wonderful to observe the difficulties he has  willingly incurred. In the distance are beautiful groups, and there is a  figure of a poor man imploring charity depicted to the life, and, more  near, a youth, a figure which proves the artist to have been master of  the then novel art of foreshortening. I have purposely described these  specimens of the early years of Raphael, more particularly than any  other writer, in order to acquaint the reader with the rise of his  divine talents. In the labours of his more mature years, the various  masters whose works he studied may each claim his own; but in his first  flight he was exclusively supported by the vigour of his own talents.  The bent of his genius, which was not less voluptuous and graceful than  it was noble and elevated, led him to that ideal beauty, grace, and  expression, which is the most refined and difficult province of  painting. To insure success in this department neither study nor art is  sufficient. A natural taste for the beautiful, an intellectual faculty  of combining the several excellences of many individuals in one perfect  whole, a vivid apprehension, and a sort of fervour in seizing the sudden  and momentary expressions of passion, a facility of touch, obedient to  the conceptions of the imagination; these were the means which nature  alone could furnish, and these, as we have seen, he possessed from his  earliest years. Whoever ascribes the success of Raffaello to the effects  of study, and not to the felicity of his genius, does not justly  appreciate the gifts which were lavished on him by nature.[29]    He now became the admiration of his master and his fellow scholars; and  about the same time Pinturicchio, after having painted with so much  applause at Rome before Raffaello was born, aspired to become, as it  were, his scholar in the great work at Siena. He did not himself possess  a genius sufficiently elevated for the sublime composition which the  place required; nor had Pietro himself sufficient fertility, or a  conception of mind equal to so novel an undertaking. It was intended to  represent the life and actions of AEneas Silvius Piccolomini, afterwards  Pope Pius II.; the embassies entrusted to him by the council of  Constance to various princes; and by Felix, the antipope, to Frederick  III., who conferred on him the laurel crown; and also the various  embassies which he undertook for Frederick himself to Eugenius IV., and  afterwards to Callistus IV., who created him a Cardinal. His subsequent  exaltation to the Papacy, and the most remarkable events of his reign,  were also to be represented; the canonization of S. Catherine; his  attendance on the Council of Mantua, where he was received in a princely  manner by the Duke; and finally his death, and the removal of his body  from Ancona to Rome. Never perhaps was an undertaking of such magnitude  entrusted to a single master. The art itself had not as yet attempted  any great flight. The principal figures in composition generally stood  isolated, as Pietro exhibited them in Perugia, without aiming at  composition. In consequence of this the proportions were seldom true,  nor did the artists depart much from sacred subjects, the frequent  repetition of which had already opened the way to plagiarism. Historical  subjects of this nature were new to Raffaello, and to him, unaccustomed  to reside in a metropolis, it must have been most difficult, in painting  so many as eleven pictures, to imitate the splendour of different  courts, and as we may say, the manners of all Europe, varying the  composition agreeably to the occasion. Nevertheless, being conducted by  his friend to Siena, he made the sketches and cartoons of _all_ these  subjects, says Vasari in his life of Pinturicchio, and that he made the  sketches of the whole is the common report at Siena. In the life of  Raffaello he states that he made _some of the designs and cartoons for  this work_, and that the reason of his not continuing them, was his  haste to proceed to Florence, to see the cartoons of Da Vinci and  Bonarruoti. But I am more inclined to the first statement of Vasari,  than the subsequent one. In April, 1503, Raffaello was employed in the  Library, as is proved by the will of Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini.[30]  While the Library was yet unfinished, Piccolomini was elected Pope on  the twenty-first day of September; and his coronation following on the  eighth of October, Pinturicchio commemorated the event on the outside of  the Library, in the part opposite to the duomo. Bottari remarks, that in  this facade we may detect not only the design, but in many of the heads  the colouring also of Raffaello. It appears probable therefore that he  remained to"]]]
