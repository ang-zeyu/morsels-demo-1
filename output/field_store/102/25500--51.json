Close tight then, and let  stand a month longer, then rack off, filter last runnings through triple  cheese cloth, bottle and cork tight. Keep where it is dark and warm,  rather than cool, but away from any sort of taints.    _Muscadine Wine_: Troublesome, but worth the trouble. Wash dead-ripe  muscadines, and pop them one by one, out of the skins. Throw away the  skins, after squeezing all juice from them--if the pulp stood with them  their burning, musky taste would ruin it. Cover it with half its bulk of  boiling water. Let stand a day and night, then strain, and add to each  gallon of juice three pounds of white rock-candy. Stir every day until  the candy dissolves. Cover with cloth until it is through fermenting.  Back off, bottle immediately, and seal, or tie down the corks. The wine  in perfection is a pale pink, very clear, and of a peculiar but  indescribably delicious flavor.    _Fruit Vinegars_: Any sort of acid fruit--as strawberries, raspberries,  gooseberries, currants, black or red, affords a refreshing drink. Pick,  wash, put over the fire to scald--when it has boiled a minute or two add  half as much cold water as fruit, and bring again to a boil. Skim clean,  take from fire and let stand till next day. Strain, then measure juice,  add two to three pounds sugar to the gallon, according to tartness  desired, put over the fire, and simmer for twenty minutes, skimming  clean. Boil in it spices most liked, tied up in thin muslin. If it seems  watery, boil another twenty minutes till the syrup shows rather rich,  then add, after taking from the fire, a quart of cider vinegar for each  gallon of syrup, mix well, bottle while still hot in small bottles, cork  and seal. Mixed half and half with ice water, or poured over finely  broken ice, or as a flavoring to tea, hot or cold, this is refreshing,  particularly in hot weather. Use in tea a spoonful to the cup or glass.    _Boiled Cider_: Reduce new sweet cider one-half by gentle boiling,  skimming it clean as it boils, then bottle, putting a clove or two, a  grain of alspice and a blade of mace in each bottle. Cork, seal and keep  in a cool place. This is especially valuable for use in mincemeat, or  for flavoring sauces for nursery puddings. A variant is to add sugar  towards the last, enough to make a thinnish syrup, which is of itself a  good sauce for simple desserts.          [Illustration: _Paste, Pies, Puddings_]      _The Philosophy of Pie-Crust_: Pie-crust perfection depends on several  things--good flour, good fat, good handling, most especially good  baking. A hot oven, quick but not scorching, expands the air betwixt  layers of paste, and pops open the flour-grains, making them absorb the  fat as it melts, thereby growing crisp and relishful instead of hard and  tough. The lighter and drier the flour the better--in very damp weather  it is best oven-dried, then cooled before mixing. Shortening, whether  lard, butter, or clarified drippings, should be very cold--unless your  recipe demands that it be softened or melted. Milk or water used in  mixing ought to be likewise well chilled, unless the shortening is  soft--in that case match its temperature. The regular rule is half-pint  ice water to the pound of flour, using chilled shortening. If the fat is  semi-fluid the paste must be mixed softer, using say, three parts of a  pint to the pound.    Baking powder or soda and cream tartar, or soda alone with sour cream or  buttermilk for wetting, makes crust light and short with less butter,  therefore is an economy. Genuine puff paste is requisite for the finest  tarts, pies, etc., etc., but light short crust answers admirably for  most things. Sift flour twice or even thrice for any sort of paste. Sift  soda or baking powder well through it, but not salt. Make the salt fine,  drop in the bottom of the mixing bowl, before the last sifting, and mix  lightly through the flour before adding the shortening. Rub in  shortening very lightly, using only the finger-tips--the palms melt or  soften it. Add milk or water, a little at a time, mixing it in with a  broad-bladed knife rather than the hands. Mix lightly--so the paste  barely sticks together. Put in first one-third of the shortening--this,  of course, for puff paste. Half a pound of butter or lard to the pound  of flour makes a very good paste, but to have it in full richness, use  three-quarters of a pound. Wash butter well to remove the salt, and  squeeze out water by wringing it in a well-floured cloth. If there is a  strong taste, or any trace of rancidity, wash well, kneading through and  through, in sweet milk, then rinse out the milk with cold water to which  a little borax has been added. Rinse again in clear cold water--this  should remove ill-flavor without injury to anybody's stomach. But be  very sure the last rinsing is thorough--borax, though wholly harmless,  adds nothing to digestibility.    The end of the repeated rollings out and foldings demanded by real puff  paste is to enclose between the layers of paste as much air as possible.  Hence the chillings between rollings. Hence also the need of pinching  edges well together after foldings, and rolling always _from_ you,  never back and forth. Roll out paste into a long narrow strip after the  first mixing, divide the remaining shortening into three equal portions,  keep very cold, and as needed cut into small bits, which spread evenly  on top of the rolled paste, which must be lightly dredged with flour.  Fold in three evenly, one thickness on another, turn so the folded edges  may be to right and left while rolling, pinch the other edges well  together and roll again into a long strip, moving the rolling-pin always  from you. Repeat until all the butter is used, then set on ice for an  hour to harden. In baking beware opening the oven door until the paste  has risen fully and becomes slightly crusted over.    Baking powder crust must not stand--the gas which aerates it begins  forming and escaping the minute it is wet up. It also requires a hot  oven and delicate handling. Half a pound of shortening and a teaspoon of  baking powder, to the pound of flour, mixed stiff or soft, according to  the consistency of the fat, properly handled and baked, make crust good  enough for anybody.    _French Puff Paste_: This is like the famous little girl--either very  good indeed or horrid. Therefore beware undertaking it until you have  experience or the confidence of absolute ignorance for your help. Either  may take you on to success--when half-knowledge or half-confidence will  spell disaster. You need for it, two pounds, thrice sifted flour, two  pounds well-washed and very cold butter, four egg-yolks well chilled,  and half a pint, more or less, of ice water, also a saltspoon of fine  salt. Rub four ounces of butter lightly into the flour, shape the rest  into a flattish oblong and set on ice. Wet the flour with the egg-yolks  and water, adding them alternately, work smooth, handling as lightly as  possible, then roll out half an inch thick, dredge lightly with flour,  lay on the ball of cold butter, fold paste over it smoothly, flatten  lightly with strokes of the rolling-pin, then roll out as thin as  possible without making the butter break through. Fold again in three,  roll again, as thin as you can. Repeat folding and rolling, then set on  ice half an hour, folding in three. Roll and fold twice again, chill  again for twenty minutes, then give two more rolls and foldings. Chill  if possible before using. If all things have worked well you will have  crust that is an experience.    _Every Day Pie Crust_: One pound flour, six ounces shortening--lard or  clarified dripping, pinch salt, half-pint ice water. Mix flour, salt and  water to a smooth dough, using a broad knife, roll out thin, spread with  a third of the fat, fold in three, roll out again, add another third of  fat, roll, add the last fat, roll again, fold and chill for ten minutes  before using.    _Cobblers_: Make from any sort of fruit in season--peaches, apples,  cherries, plums or berries. Green gooseberries are inadvisable, through  being too tart and too tedious. Stone cherries, pare peaches or apples  and slice thin, halve plums if big enough, and remove stones--if not,  wash, drain well, and use whole. Line a skillet or deep pie pan--it must  be three inches deep at least, liberally with short crust, rolled  rather more than a quarter-inch thick. Fit well, then prick all over  with a blunt fork. Fill with the prepared fruit, put on an upper crust a  quarter-inch thick and plenty big enough, barely press the crust edges  together, prick well with a fork all over the top, and cook in a hot  oven half to three-quarters of an hour, according to size. Take up,  remove top crust, lay it inverted upon another plate, sweeten the hot  fruit liberally, adding if you like, a spoonful of brandy, adding also a  good lump of the best butter. Mix well through the fruit, then dip out  enough of it to make a thick layer over the top crust. Grate nutmeg over  apple pies, or strew on a little powdered cinnamon. A few blades of mace  baked with the fruit accent the apple flavor beautifully. Cherries take  kindly to brandy, but require less butter than either peaches or apples.  Give plums plenty of sugar with something over for the stones. Cook a  few stones with them for flavor, even if you take away the bulk. Do the  same with cherries, using, say, a dozen pits to the pie.    Serve cobbler hot or cold. If hot, serve with it hard brandy sauce, made  by creaming together a cup of sugar, a tablespoonful of butter, then  working in two tablespoonfuls of brandy or good whiskey. Right here is  perhaps the place to say once for all, good whiskey is far and away  better in anything than poor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#9)"],[1," reports were true, journeyed to the south. In due time  he came to Odin's palace, where he was expected, and where he was  deluded by the vision of Har, Iafn-har, and Thridi, three divinities,  enthroned one above the other. The gatekeeper, Gangler, answered all  his questions, and gave him a long explanation of Northern mythology,  which is recorded in the Younger Edda, and then, having finished his  instructions, suddenly vanished with the palace amid a deafening noise.    According to other very ancient poems, Odin's sons, Weldegg, Beldegg,  Sigi, Skiold, Saeming, and Yngvi, became kings of East Saxony, West  Saxony, Franconia, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and from them are  descended the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, and the royal families of the  Northern lands. Still another version relates that Odin and Frigga had  seven sons, who founded the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy. In the course of  time this mysterious king was confounded with the Odin whose worship  he introduced, and all his deeds were attributed to the god.    Odin was worshipped in numerous temples, but especially in the  great fane at Upsala, where the most solemn festivals were held,  and where sacrifices were offered. The victim was generally a horse,  but in times of pressing need human offerings were made, even the  king being once offered up to avert a famine.          \"Upsal's temple, where the North      Saw Valhal's halls fair imag'd here on earth.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      The first toast at every festival here was drunk in his honour, and,  besides the first of May, one day in every week was held sacred to  him, and, from his Saxon name, Woden, was called Woden's day, whence  the English word \"Wednesday\" has been derived. It was customary for  the people to assemble at his shrine on festive occasions, to hear  the songs of the scalds, who were rewarded for their minstrelsy by  the gift of golden bracelets or armlets, which curled up at the ends  and were called \"Odin's serpents.\"    There are but few remains of ancient Northern art now extant, and  although rude statues of Odin were once quite common they have all  disappeared, as they were made of wood--a perishable substance, which  in the hands of the missionaries, and especially of Olaf the Saint,  the Northern iconoclast, was soon reduced to ashes.          \"There in the Temple, carved in wood,      The image of great Odin stood.\"                Saga of King Olaf (Longfellow).      Odin himself is supposed to have given his people a code of laws  whereby to govern their conduct, in a poem called Havamal, or the  High Song, which forms part of the Edda. In this lay he taught  the fallibility of man, the necessity for courage, temperance,  independence, and truthfulness, respect for old age, hospitality,  charity, and contentment, and gave instructions for the burial of  the dead.          \"At home let a man be cheerful,      And toward a guest liberal;      Of wise conduct he should be,      Of good memory and ready speech;      If much knowledge he desires,      He must often talk on what is good.\"                Havamal (Thorpe's tr.).              CHAPTER III: FRIGGA      The Queen of the Gods    Frigga, or Frigg, daughter of Fiorgyn and sister of Joerd, according to  some mythologists, is considered by others as a daughter of Joerd and  Odin, whom she eventually married. This wedding caused such general  rejoicing in Asgard, where the goddess was greatly beloved, that ever  after it was customary to celebrate its anniversary with feast and  song, and the goddess being declared patroness of marriage, her health  was always proposed with that of Odin and Thor at wedding feasts.    Frigga was goddess of the atmosphere, or rather of the clouds, and as  such was represented as wearing either snow-white or dark garments,  according to her somewhat variable moods. She was queen of the gods,  and she alone had the privilege of sitting on the throne Hlidskialf,  beside her august husband. From thence she too could look over all  the world and see what was happening, and, according to the belief  of our ancestors, she possessed the knowledge of the future, which,  however, no one could ever prevail upon her to reveal, thus proving  that Northern women could keep a secret inviolate.          \"Of me the gods are sprung;      And all that is to come I know, but lock      In my own breast, and have to none reveal'd.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      She was generally represented as a tall, beautiful, and stately woman,  crowned with heron plumes, the symbol of silence or forgetfulness, and  clothed in pure white robes, secured at the waist by a golden girdle,  from which hung a bunch of keys, the distinctive sign of the Northern  housewife, whose special patroness she was said to be. Although she  often appeared beside her husband, Frigga preferred to remain in her  own palace, called Fensalir, the hall of mists or of the sea, where  she diligently plied her wheel or distaff, spinning golden thread or  weaving long webs of bright-coloured clouds.    In order to perform this work she made use of a marvellous jewelled  spinning wheel or distaff, which at night shone brightly in the sky as  a constellation, known in the North as Frigga's Spinning Wheel, while  the inhabitants of the South called the same stars Orion's Girdle.    To her hall Fensalir the gracious goddess invited husbands and wives  who had led virtuous lives on earth, so that they might enjoy each  other's companionship even after death, and never be called upon to  part again.          \"There in the glen, Fensalir stands, the house      Of Frea, honour'd mother of the gods,      And shows its lighted windows and the open doors.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      Frigga was therefore considered the goddess of conjugal and  motherly love, and was specially worshipped by married lovers and  tender parents. This exalted office did not entirely absorb her  thoughts however, for we are told that she was very fond of dress,  and whenever she appeared before the assembled gods her attire was  rich and becoming, and her jewels chosen with much taste.        The Stolen Gold    Frigga's love of adornment once led her sadly astray, for, in her  longing to possess some new ornament, she secretly purloined a piece  of gold from a statue representing her husband, which had just been  placed in his temple. The stolen metal was entrusted to the dwarfs,  with instructions to fashion a marvellous necklace for her use. This,  when finished, was so resplendent that it greatly enhanced her charms,  and even increased Odin's love for her. But when he discovered the  theft of the gold he angrily summoned the dwarfs and bade them reveal  who had dared to touch his statue. Unwilling to betray the queen of  the gods, the dwarfs remained obstinately silent, and, seeing that  no information could be elicited from them, Odin commanded that the  statue should be placed above the temple gate, and set to work to  devise runes which should endow it with the power of speech and enable  it to denounce the thief. When Frigga heard these tidings she trembled  with fear, and implored her favourite attendant, Fulla, to invent some  means of protecting her from Allfather's wrath. Fulla, who was always  ready to serve her mistress, immediately departed, and soon returned,  accompanied by a hideous dwarf, who promised to prevent the statue  from speaking if Frigga would only deign to smile graciously upon  him. This boon having been granted, the dwarf hastened off to the  temple, caused a deep sleep to fall upon the guards, and while they  were thus unconscious, pulled the statue down from its pedestal and  broke it to pieces, so that it could never betray Frigga's theft,  in spite of all Odin's efforts to give it the power of speech.    Odin, discovering this sacrilege on the morrow, was very angry indeed;  so angry that he left Asgard and utterly disappeared, carrying away  with him all the blessings which he had been wont to shower upon gods  and men. According to some authorities, his brothers, as we have  already seen, took advantage of his absence to assume his form and  secure possession of his throne and wife; but although they looked  exactly like him they could not restore the lost blessings, and allowed  the ice-giants, or Jotuns, to invade the earth and bind it fast in  their cold fetters. These wicked giants pinched the leaves and buds  till they all shrivelled up, stripped the trees bare, shrouded the  earth in a great white coverlet, and veiled it in impenetrable mists.    But at the end of seven weary months the true Odin relented and  returned, and when he saw all the evil that had been done he drove  the usurpers away, forced the frost-giants to relax their grip of the  earth and to release her from her icy bonds, and again showered all  his blessings down upon her, cheering her with the light of his smile.        Odin Outwitted    As has already been seen, Odin, although god of wit and wisdom, was  sometimes no match for his wife Frigga, who, womanlike, was sure to  obtain her way by some means. On one occasion the august pair were  seated upon Hlidskialf, gazing with interest upon the Winilers and  Vandals, who were preparing for a battle which was to decide which  people should henceforth have supremacy. Odin gazed with satisfaction  upon the Vandals, who were loudly praying to him for victory; but  Frigga watched the movements of the Winilers with more attention,  because they had entreated her aid. She therefore turned to Odin  and coaxingly inquired whom he meant to favour on the morrow; he,  wishing to evade her question, declared he would not decide, as it  was time for bed, but would give the victory to those upon whom his  eyes first rested in the morning.    This answer was shrewdly calculated, for Odin knew that his couch  was so turned that upon waking he would face the"]]]
