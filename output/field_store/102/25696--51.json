The _Merrimac_ commenced the action by discharging a broadside at the  _Congress_, one shell from which killed or disabled a number of men at the  guns, and then kept on towards the _Cumberland_, which she approached with  full steam on, striking her on the port side near the bow, her stem  knocking two of the ports into one, and her ram striking the vessel under  the water-line. Almost instantaneously a large shell was discharged from  her forward gun, which raked the gun-deck of the doomed ship, and killed  ten men. Five minutes later the ship began to sink by the head, a large  hole having been made by the point of the ram, through which the water  rushed in. As the _Merrimac_ rounded and rapidly came up again, she once  more raked the _Cumberland_, killing or wounding sixteen more men.  Meantime the latter was endeavouring to defend herself, and poured  broadside after broadside into the _Merrimac_; but the balls, as one of  the survivors tells us, bounced \"upon her mailed sides like india-rubber,  apparently making not the least impression except to cut off her  flagstaff, and thus bring down the Confederate colours. None of her crew  ventured at that time on her outside to replace them, and she fought  thenceforward with only her pennant flying.\"(18) Shortly after this, the  _Merrimac_ again attacked the unfortunate ship, advancing with her  greatest speed, her ram making another hole below the water-line. The  _Cumberland_ began to fill rapidly. The scene on board is hardly to be  described in words. It was one of horrible desperation and fruitless  heroism. The decks were slippery with human gore; shreds of human flesh,  and portions of the body, arms, legs, and headless trunks were scattered  everywhere. Below, the cockpit was filled with wounded, whom it would be  impossible to succour, for the ship was sinking fast. Meantime the men  stuck to their posts, powder was still served out, and the firing kept up  steadily, several of the crew lingering so long in the after shell-room,  in their eagerness to pass up shell, that they were drowned there. The  water had now reached the main gun-deck, and it became evident that the  contest was nearly over. Still the men lingered, anxious for one last  shot, when their guns were nearly under water.      \"Shall we give them a broadside, my boys, as she goes?        Shall we send yet another to tell,    In iron-tongued words, to Columbia's foes,        How bravely her sons say 'Farewell?'\"    The word was passed for each man to save himself. Even then, one man, an  active little fellow, named Matthew Tenney, whose courage had been  conspicuous during the action, determined to fire once more, the next gun  to his own being then under water, the vessel going down by the head. He  succeeded, but at the cost of his life, for immediately afterwards,  attempting to scramble out of the port-hole, the water suddenly rushed in  with such force that he was washed back and drowned. Scores of poor  fellows were unable to reach the upper deck, and were carried down with  the vessel. The _Cumberland_ sank in water up to the cross-trees, and went  down _with her flag still flying from the peak_.(19) The whole number lost  was not less than 120 souls. Her top-masts, with the pennant flying far  above the water, long marked the locality of one of the bravest and most  desperate defences ever made      \"By men who knew that all else was wrong        But to die when a sailor ought.\"    The _Cumberland_ being utterly demolished, the _Merrimac_ turned her  attention to the _Congress_. The Southerners showed their chivalric  instincts at this juncture by not firing on the boats, or on a small  steamer, which were engaged in picking up the survivors of the  _Cumberland's_ crew. The officers of the _Congress_, seeing the fate of  the _Cumberland_, determined that the _Merrimac_ should not, at least,  sink their vessel. They therefore got all sail on the ship, and attempted  to run ashore. The _Merrimac_ was soon close on them, and delivered a  broadside, which was terribly destructive, a shell killing, at one of the  guns, every man engaged except one. Backing, and then returning several  times, she delivered broadside after broadside at less than 100 yards'  distance. The _Congress_ replied manfully and obstinately, but with little  effect. One shot is supposed to have entered one of the ironclad's  port-holes, and dismounted a gun, as there was no further firing from that  port, and a few splinters of iron were struck off her sloping mailed roof,  but this was all. The guns of the _Merrimac_ appeared to have been  specially trained on the after-magazine of the _Congress_, and shot after  shot entered that part of the ship. Thus, slowly drifting down with the  current, and again steaming up, the _Merrimac_ continued for an hour to  fire into her opponent. Several times the _Congress_ was on fire, but the  flames were kept under. At length the ship was on fire in so many places,  and the flames gathering with such force, that it was hopeless and  suicidal to keep up the defence any longer. The national flag was sadly  and sorrowfully hauled down, and a white flag hoisted at the peak. The  _Merrimac_ did not for a few minutes see this token of surrender, and  continued to fire. At last, however, it was discerned through the clouds  of smoke, and the broadsides ceased. A tug that had followed the  _Merrimac_ out of Norfolk then came alongside the _Congress_, and ordered  the officers on board. This they refused, hoping that, from the nearness  of the shore, they would be able to escape. Some of the men, to the  number, it is believed, of about forty, thought the tug was one of the  Northern (Federal) vessels, and rushed on board, and were, of course, soon  carried off as prisoners. By the time that all the able men were off  ashore and elsewhere, it was seven o'clock in the evening, and the  _Congress_ was a bright sheet of flame fore and aft, her guns, which were  loaded and trained, going off as the fire reached them. A shell from one  struck a sloop at some distance, and blew her up. At midnight the fire  reached her magazines, containing five tons of gunpowder, and, with a  terrific explosion, her charred remains blew up. Thus had the _Merrimac_  sunk one and burned a second of the largest of the vessels of the enemy.    Having settled the fate of these two ships, the _Merrimac_ had, about 5  o'clock in the afternoon, started to tackle the _Minnesota_. Here, as was  afterwards proved, the commander of the former had the intention of  capturing the latter as a prize, and had no wish to destroy her. He,  therefore, stood off about a mile distant, and with the _Yorktown_ and  _Jamestown_, threw shot and shell at the frigate, doing it considerable  damage, and killing six men. One shell entered near her waist, passed  through the chief engineer's room, knocking two rooms into one, and  wounded several men; a shot passed through the main-mast. At nightfall the  _Merrimac_, satisfied with her afternoon's work of death and destruction,  steamed in under Sewall's Point. \"The day,\" said the Baltimore _American_,  \"thus closed most dismally for our side, and with the most gloomy  apprehensions of what would occur the next day. The _Minnesota_ was at the  mercy of the _Merrimac_, and there appeared no reason why the iron monster  might not clear the Roads of our fleet, destroy all the stores and  warehouses on the beach, drive our troops into the fortress, and command  Hampton Roads against any number of wooden vessels the Government might  send there. Saturday was a terribly dismal night at Fortress Monroe.\"    But about nine o'clock that evening Ericsson's battery, the _Monitor_,(20)  arrived in Hampton Roads, and hope revived in the breasts of the  despondent Northerners. She was not a very formidable-looking craft, for,  lying low on the water, with a plain structure amidships, a small  pilot-house forward, and a diminutive funnel aft, she might have been  taken for a raft. It was only on board that her real strength might be  discovered. She carried armour about five inches thick over a large part  of her, and had practically two hulls, the lower of which had sides  inclining at an angle of 51 deg. from the vertical line. It was considered  that no shot could hurt this lower hull, on account of the angle at which  it must strike it. The revolving turret, an iron cylinder, nine feet high,  and twenty feet in diameter, eight or nine inches thick everywhere, and  about the portholes eleven inches, was moved round by steam-power. When  the two heavy Dahlgren guns were run in for loading, a kind of pendulum  port fell over the holes in the turret. The propeller, rudder, and even  anchor, were all hidden.    This was a war of surprises and sudden changes. It is doubtful if the  Southerners knew what to make of the strange-looking battery which steamed  towards them next morning, or whether they despised it. The _Merrimac_ and  the _Monitor_ kept on approaching each other, the former waiting until she  would choose her distance, and the latter apparently not knowing what to  make of her queer-looking antagonist. The first shot from the _Monitor_  was fired when about one hundred yards distant from the _Merrimac_, and  this distance was subsequently reduced to fifty yards; and at no time  during the furious cannonading that ensued were the vessels more than two  hundred yards apart. The scene was in plain view from Fortress Monroe, and  in the main facts all the spectators agree. At first the fight was very  furious, and the guns of the _Monitor_ were fired rapidly. The latter  carried only two guns, to its opponent's eight, and received two or three  shots for every one she gave. Finding that she was much more formidable  than she looked, the _Merrimac_ attempted to run her down; but her  superior speed and quicker handling enabled her to dodge and turn "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#9)"],[1," direction from Brownsville is unknown; probably the locality  was on the road between that town and San Fernando, Tamaulipas, which  is south-southwest of Brownsville.      =Pteronotus rubiginosus mexicanus= (Miller)    Mustached Bat         1902. _Chilonycteris mexicana_ Miller, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.       Philadelphia, 54:401, September 12, type from San Blas,       Nayarit.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southern part of state in       areas of tropical forest.    Most individuals of this species were taken in mist nets. Northwest of  El Encino for example, bats were collected from a net placed in \"a  strategic position across a narrow opening\" (Schaldach, fieldnotes) in  a cave near the headwaters of the Rio Sabinas; along the same river at  Rancho Pano Ayuctle some were taken in a net stretched across a little  creek (arroyo). In the cave near El Encino the collector (Schaldach)  estimated the population of _P. rubiginosus_ at between two and three  hundred; at Ojo de Agua this bat was found in the deepest part of a  cave in association with _Myotis nigricans_.    Two June-taken females from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were lactating,  and weighed 17 and 18 grams.    The generic name _Pteronotus_ is employed instead of _Chilonycteris_  following Burt and Stirton (1961:24-25). The specific name  _rubiginosus_ is used in accordance with de la Torre (1955:696).  Tamaulipan specimens are assigned to _P. r. mexicana_ because they do  not differ from specimens of that subspecies from Nayarit, except that  the coloration of Tamaulipan specimens averages slightly darker in both  color phases.    Specimens of this subspecies from the Sierra de Tamaulipas, previously  recorded by Anderson (1956:349), are the northernmost reported in  eastern Mexico.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 31: Sierra de       Tamaulipas, 2 mi.

According to field-notes of Schaldach _et al._, individuals of _P. d.  fulvus_ appear when it is almost dark (about 6:30 p. m. in December and  January), ordinarily fly about 25 feet above the ground, but  occasionally are seen at heights of between 60 and 70 feet (near tops  of the largest cypress trees). Most bats flew in a straight line for 10  to 20 yards, then zig-zagged, and repeated the same movements. All  specimens examined are in the brown color phase.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 11: Rancho       Santa Rosa, 25 km. N, 13 km. W Cd.

Specimens from La Mula were obtained in a small cave, which was  inhabited also by _Desmodus rotundus_ and _Tadarida brasiliensis_. The  specimens from Miquihuana were captured in a mine by a native. Those  from four kilometers north of Joya Verde also were taken from a mine.  Females obtained in August at La Mula were lactating.    Specimens examined are indistinguishable from _C. mexicana_ from Oaxaca  and Jalisco. Baker (1956:172) found no differences between Coahuilan  and Tamaulipan specimens. Most Tamaulipan specimens are dark grayish,  but some are brownish and some are intermediate between the two colors  mentioned.

Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were taken in mist nets in  which _Pteronotus rubiginosus_, _Lasiurus borealis_, or _Centurio  senex_ also were captured. The specimen from Rancho Santa Rosa was shot  as it flew at a height of six feet.    Tamaulipan specimens of _Mormoops megalophylla_ are here assigned to  _M. m. megalophylla_ instead of to _M. m. senicula_ following Villa and  Jimenez (1961:503), who regarded _senicula_ as indistinguishable from  _megalophylla_.    Weight of four specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas averaged 16.2  (15-18) grams.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 5: Sierra de       Tamaulipas, 3 mi. S, 16 mi.

Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were taken in a cave along with  _Desmodus rotundus_ and _Tadarida laticaudata_. Specimens from 20 miles  north of El Mante were collected from a cave about 50 yards deep.  Weights of two females from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were 9 and 12  grams.

Washington, 13:126, April 6.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably throughout southern       part of state, but presently known only from one locality.    The specimens herein reported were taken in a cave. They provide the  first record of the species from Tamaulipas and are assigned to the  subspecies _nivalis_ on the basis of their brownish color and small  size in comparison with specimens of _L. n. longala_ from Coahuila (see  also description and measurements of _longala_ given by Stains,  1957:356). None of the specimens suggests intergradation in color  between _nivalis_ and _longala_, but some are slightly larger than  specimens of the former from Veracruz.    Twelve females taken on August 27, 1961, were pregnant. Each carried a  single embryo, the embryos averaging 15.7 (12-20) mm. in crown-rump  length. The average weight of the 12 females was 26.9 (24.5-30.0)  grams; 10 males weighed an average of 24.6 (21-28) grams.         _Measurements._--Average and extremes of ten specimens (5       males and 5 females) are as follows: 78.2 (76-80); 0.0; 16.4       (15-17); 16.7 (16-19); length of forearm, 48.4 (45.2-54.3);       length of third finger, 100.8 (99.2-103.7); greatest length       of skull, 26.8 (25.9-27.6); zygomatic breadth (6 only), 10.9       (10.7-11.1); least interorbital constriction, 4.6 (4.5-4.9);       mastoid breadth, 10.8 (10.5-11.2); length of maxillary       tooth-row, 8.7 (8.4-9.0).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 28: all from       6.5 mi.
