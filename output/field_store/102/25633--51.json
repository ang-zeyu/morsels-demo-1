[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#9)"],[1,"of the _De  Revolutionibus_, proof of its influence is to be found in such widely  separated places as London and the great Spanish University of  Salamanca. In 1551, Robert Recorde, court physician to Edward and to  Mary and teacher of mathematics, published in London his _Castle of  Knowledge_, an introduction to astronomy and the first book printed in  England describing the Copernican system.[190] He evidently did not  consider the times quite ripe for a full avowal of his own allegiance  to the new doctrine, but the remarks of the _Maister_ and the  _Scholler_ are worth repeating:[191]         \"MAISTER: ... howbeit Copernicus a man of great learning, of       much experience, and of wonderfull diligence in observation,       hath renewed the opinion of Aristarchus Samius, affirming       that the earth, not onely moveth circularly about his owne       centre, but also may be, yea and is, continually out of the       precise centre of the world eight and thirty hundred       thousand miles: but because the understanding of that       controversie depends of profounder knowledge than in this       Introduction may be uttered conveniently, I wil let it passe       til some other time.         \"SCHOLLER: Nay sit, in good faith, I desire not to heare       such vaine fantasies, so farre against the common reason,       and repugnant to the content of all the learned multitude of       Writers, and therefore let it passe for ever and a day       longer.         \"MAISTER: You are too yong to be a good judge in so great a       matter: it passeth farre your learning, and their's also,       that are much better learned than you, to improuve his       supposition by good arguments, and therefore you were best       condemne nothing that you do not well understand: but an       other time, as I saide, I will so declare his supposition,       that you shall not onely wonder to heare it, but also       peradventure be as earnest then to credite it, as you are       now to condemne it: in the meane season let us proceed       forward in our former order....\"    [Footnote 190: _Dict. of Nat. Biog._: \"Recorde.\"]    [Footnote 191: Quoted (p. 135), from the edition of 1596 in the  library of Mr. George A. Plimpton. See also Recorde's _Whetstone of  Witte_ (1557) as cited by Berry, 127.]    This little book, reprinted in 1556 and in 1596, and one of the most  popular of the mathematical writings in England during that century,  must have interested the English in the new doctrine even before  Bruno's emphatic presentation of it to them in the eighties.    Yet the English did not welcome it cordially. One of the most popular  books of this period was Sylvester's translation (1591) of DuBartas's  _The Divine Weeks_ which appeared in France in 1578, a book loved  especially by Milton.[192] DuBartas writes:[193]        \"Those clerks that think--think how absurd a jest!      That neither heavens nor stars do turn at all,      Nor dance around this great, round earthly ball,      But the earth itself, this massy globe of our's,      Turns round about once every twice twelve hours!      And we resemble land-bred novices      New brought aboard to venture on the seas;      Who at first launching from the shore suppose      The ship stands still and that the firm earth goes.\"    [Footnote 192: DuBartas: _The Divine Weeks_ (Sylvester's trans. edited  by Haight): Preface, pp. xx-xxiii and note.]    [Footnote 193: _Op. cit._: 72.]    Quite otherwise was the situation in the sixteenth century at the  University of Salamanca. A new set of regulations for the University,  drawn up at the King's order by Bishop Covarrubias, was published in  1561. It contained the provision in the curriculum that \"Mathematics  and Astrology are to be given in three years, the first, Astrology,  the second, Euclid, Ptolemy or Copernicus _ad vota audientium_,\" which  also indicates, as Vicente de la Fuente points out, that at this  University \"the choice of the subject-matter to be taught lay not with  the teachers but with the students, a rare situation.\"[194] One  wonders what happened there when the professors and students received  word[195] from the Cardinal Nuncio at Madrid in 1633 that the  Congregations of the Index had decreed the Copernican doctrine was  thereafter in no way to be held, taught or defended.    [Footnote 194: La Fuente: _Historia de la Universidades ... de  Espana_: II, 314.]    [Footnote 195: _Doc. 86_ in Favaro: 130.]    One of the graduates of this University, Father Zuniga,[196] (better  known as Didacus a Stunica), wrote a commentary on Job that was  licensed to be printed in 1579, but was not published until 1584 at  Toledo. Another edition appeared at Rome seven years later. It  evidently was widely read for it was condemned _donec corrigatur_ by  the Index in 1616 and the mathematical literature of the next half  century contains many allusions to his remarks on Job: IX: 6; \"Who  shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.\"  After commenting here upon the greater clarity and simplicity of the  Copernican theory, Didacus a Stunica then states that the theory is  not contradicted by Solomon in Ecclesiastes, as that \"text signifieth  no more but this, that although the succession of ages, and  generations of men on earth be various, yet the earth itself is still  one and the same, and continueth without any sensible variation\" ...  and \"it hath no coherence with its context (as Philosophers show) if  it be expounded to speak of the earth's immobility. The motion that  belongs to the earth by way of speech is assigned to the sun even by  Copernicus himself, and those who are his followers.... To conclude,  no place can be produced out of Holy Scriptures which so clearly  speaks the earth's immobility as this doth its mobility. Therefore  this text of which we have spoken is easily reconciled to this  opinion. And to set forth the wonderful power and wisdom of God who  can indue the frame of the whole earth (it being of monstrous weight  by nature) with motion, this our Divine pen-man added; 'And the  pillars thereof tremble:' As if he would teach us, from the doctrine  laid down, that it is moved from its foundations.\"[197]    [Footnote 196: _Diccionario Enciclopedico Hispano-Americano de  literatura, ciencias y artes_ (Barcelona, 1898).]    [Footnote 197: Quoted in Salusbury: _Math. Coll._: I, 468-470 (1661),  as a work inaccessible to most readers at that time because of its  extreme rarity. It remained on the Index until the edition of 1835.]    French thinkers, like the English, did not encourage the new doctrine  at this time. Montaigne[198] was characteristically indifferent: \"What  shall we reape by it, but only that we neede not care which of the two  it be? And who knoweth whether a hundred yeares hence a third opinion  will arise which happily shall overthrow these two praecedent?\" The  famous political theorist, Jean Bodin, (1530-1596), was as thoroughly  opposed to it as DuBartas had been. In the last year of his life,  Bodin wrote his _Universae Naturae Theatrum_[199] in which he discussed  the origin and composition of the universe and of the animal,  vegetable, mineral and spiritual kingdoms. These five books (or  divisions) reveal his amazing ideas of geology, physics and astronomy  while at the same time they show a mind thoroughly at home in Hebrew  and Arabian literature as well as in the classics. His answer to the  Copernican doctrine is worth quoting to illustrate the attitude of one  of the keenest thinkers in a brilliant era:         \"THEORIST: Since the sun's heat is so intense that we read       it has sometimes burned crops, houses and cities in       Scythia,[200] would it not be more reasonable that the sun       is still and the earth indeed revolves?         \"MYSTIC: Such was the old idea of Philolaus, Timaeus,       Ecphantes, Seleucus, Aristarchus of Samos, Archimedes and       Eudoxus, which Copernicus has renewed in our time. But it       can easily be refuted by its shallowness although no one has       done it thoroughly.         \"THE.: What arguments do they rely on who hold that the       earth is revolved and that the sun forsooth is still?         \"MYS.: Because the comprehension of the human mind cannot       grasp the incredible speed of the heavenly spheres and       especially of the tenth sphere which must be ten times       greater than that of the eighth, for in twenty-four hours it       must traverse 469,562,845 miles, so that the earth seems       like a dot in the universe. This is the chief argument.       Besides this, we get rid entirely of epicycles in       representing the motions of the planets and what is taught       concerning the motion of trepidation in the eighth sphere       vanishes. Also, there is no need for the ninth and tenth       spheres. There is one argument which they have omitted but       which seems to me more efficacious than any, viz.: rest is       nobler than movement, and that celestial and divine things       have a stable nature while elemental things have motion,       disturbance and unrest; therefore it seems more probable       that the latter move rather than the former. But while       serious absurdities result from the idea of Eudoxus, far       more serious ones result from that of Copernicus.         \"THE.: What are these absurdities?         \"MYS.: Eudoxus knew nothing of trepidation, so his idea       seems to be less in error. But Copernicus, in order to       uphold his own hypothesis, claims the earth has three       motions, its diurnal and annual ones, and trepidation; if we       add to these the pull of weight towards the center, we are       attributing four natural motions to one and the same body.       If this is granted, then the very foundations of physics       must fall into ruins; for all are agreed upon this that each       natural body has but one motion of its own, and that all      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#9)"],[1,"ster, the steward, to place my name on the list of  the persons of his household who would accompany him. My preparations  did not require much time; for I was delighted with the idea of being  attached to the personal service of so great a man, and in imagination  saw myself already beyond the Alps. But the First Consul set out without  me. Pfister, by a defect of memory, perhaps intentional, had forgotten  to place my name on the list. I was in despair, and went to relate, with  tears, my misfortune to my excellent mistress, who was good enough to  endeavor to console me, saying, \"Well, Constant, everything is not lost;  you will stay with me. You can hunt in the park to pass the time; and  perhaps the First Consul may yet send for you.\" However, Madame  Bonaparte did not really believe this; for she thought, as I did,  although out of kindness she did not wish to say this to me, that the  First Consul having changed his mind, and no longer wishing my services  on the campaign, had himself given the counter orders. However, I soon  had proof to the contrary. In passing through Dijon, on his way to Mt.  St. Bernard, the First Consul asked for me, and learning that they had  forgotten me, expressed his dissatisfaction, and directed Bourrienne to  write immediately to Madame Bonaparte, requesting her to send me on  without delay.    One morning, when my chagrin was more acute than ever, Madame Bonaparte  sent for me, and said, holding Bourrienne's letter in her hand,  \"Constant, since you have determined to quit us to make the campaign, you  may rejoice, for you are now about to leave. The First Consul has sent  for you. Go to the office of Maret, and ascertain if he will not soon  send a courier. You will accompany him.\" I was inexpressibly delighted  at this good news, and did not try to conceal my pleasure. \"You are very  well satisfied to leave us,\" said Madame Bonaparte with a kind smile.  \"It is not leaving Madame, but joining the First Consul, which delights  me.\"--\"I hope so,\" replied she. \"Go, Constant; and take good care of  him.\" If any incentive had been needed, this injunction of my noble  mistress would have added to the zeal and fidelity with which I had  determined to discharge my new duties. I hurried without delay to the  office of Maret, secretary of state, who already knew me, and had shown  his good-will for me. \"Get ready at once,\" said he; \"a courier will set  out this evening or to-morrow morning.\" I returned in all haste to  Malmaison, and announced to Madame Bonaparte my immediate departure. She  immediately had a good post-chaise made ready for me, and Thibaut (for  that was the name of the courier I was to accompany) was directed to  obtain horses for me along the route. Maret gave me eight hundred francs  for the expenses of my trip, which sum, entirely unexpected by me, filled  me with wonder, for I had never been so rich. At four o'clock in the  morning, having heard from Thibaut that everything was ready, I went to  his house, where the post-chaise awaited me, and we set out.    I traveled very comfortably, sometimes in the postchaise, sometimes on  horseback; I taking Thibaut's place, and he mine. I expected to overtake  the First Consul at Martigny; but his traveling had been so rapid, that I  caught up with him only at the convent of Mt. St. Bernard. Upon our  route we constantly passed regiments on the march, composed of officers  and soldiers who were hastening to rejoin their different corps. Their  enthusiasm was irrepressible,--those who had made the campaign of Italy  rejoiced at returning to so fine a country; those who had not yet done so  were burning with impatience to see the battlefields immortalized by  French valor, and by the genius of the hero who still marched at their  head. All went as if to a festival, and singing songs they climbed the  mountains of Valais. It was eight o'clock in the morning when I arrived  at headquarters. Pfister announced me; and I found the general-in-chief  in the great hall, in the basement of the Hospice. He was taking  breakfast, standing, with his staff. As soon as he saw me, he said,  \"Here you are, you queer fellow! why didn't you come with me?\" I excused  myself by saying that to my great regret I had received a counter order,  or, at least, they had left me behind at the moment of departure. \"Lose  no time, my friend; eat quickly; we are about to start.\" From this  moment I was attached to the personal service of the First Consul, in the  quality of ordinary valet; that is to say, in my turn. This duty gave me  little to do; Hambard, the head valet of the First Consul, being in the  habit of dressing him from head to foot.    Immediately after breakfast we began to descend the mountain, many  sliding down on the snow, very much as they coast at the garden Beaujon,  from top to bottom of the Montagnes Russes, and I followed their example.  This they called \"sledding.\" The general-in-chief also descended in this  manner an almost perpendicular glacier. His guide was a young  countryman, active and courageous, to whom the First Consul promised a  sufficiency for the rest of his days. Some young soldiers who had  wandered off into the snow were found, almost dead with cold, by the  dogs sent out by the monks, and carried to the Hospice, where they  received every possible attention, and their lives were saved. The First  Consul gave substantial proof of his gratitude to the good fathers for a  charity so useful and generous. Before leaving the Hospice, where he had  found tables loaded with food already prepared awaiting the soldiers as  soon as they reached the summit of the mountain, he gave to the good  monks a considerable sum of money, in reward for the hospitality he and  his companions in arms had received, and an order on the treasury for an  annuity in support of the convent.    The same day we climbed Mount Albaredo; but as this passage was  impracticable for cavalry and artillery, he ordered them to pass outside  the town of Bard, under the batteries of the fort. The First Consul had  ordered that they should pass it at night, and on a gallop; and he had  straw tied around the wheels of the caissons and on the feet of the  horses, but even these precautions were not altogether sufficient to  prevent the Austrians hearing our troops. The cannon of the fort rained  grape-shot incessantly; but fortunately the houses of the town sheltered  our soldiers from the enemy's guns, and more than half the army passed  without much loss. I was with the household of the First Consul, which  under the care of General Gardanne flanked the fort.    The 23d of May we forded a torrent which flowed between the town and the  fort, with the First Consul at our head, and then, followed by General  Berthier and some other officers, took the path over the Albaredo, which  overlooked the fort and the town of Bard. Directing his field-glass  towards the hostile batteries, from the fire of which he was protected  only by a few bushes, he criticised the dispositions which had been made  by the officer in charge of the siege of the fort, and ordered changes,  which he said would cause the place to fall into our hands in a short  time. Freed now from the anxiety which this fort had caused him, and  which he said had prevented his sleeping the two days he had passed in  the convent of Maurice, he stretched himself at the foot of a fir-tree  and took a refreshing nap, while the army was making good its passage.  Rising from this brief interval of repose, he descended the mountain and  continued his march to Ivree, where we passed the night.    The brave General Lannes, who commanded the advance guard, acted somewhat  in the capacity of quartermaster, taking possession of all the places  which barred the road. Only a few hours before we entered he had forced  the passage of Ivree.    Such was this miraculous passage of St. Bernard. Horses, cannon,  caissons, and an immense quantity of army stores of all kinds,  everything, in fact, was drawn or carried over glaciers which appeared  inaccessible, and by paths which seemed impracticable even for a single  man. The Austrian cannon were not more successful than the snow in  stopping the French army. So true is it that the genius and perseverance  of the First Consul were communicated, so to speak, to the humblest of  his soldiers, and inspired them with a courage and a strength, the  results of which will appear fabulous to posterity.    On the 2d of June, which was the day after the passage of the Ticino, and  the day of our entrance into Milan, the First Consul learned that the  fort of Bard had been taken the evening before, showing that his  dispositions had led to a quick result, and the road of communication by  the St. Bernard was now free from all obstructions. The First Consul  entered Milan without having met much resistance, the whole population  turned out on his entrance, and he was received with a thousand  acclamations. The confidence of the Milanese redoubled when they learned  that he had promised the members of the assembled clergy to maintain the  catholic worship and clergy as already established, and had compelled  them to take the oath of fidelity to the cisalpine republic.    The First Consul remained several days in this capital; and I had time to  form a more intimate acquaintance with my colleagues, who were, as I have  said, Hambard, Roustan, and Hebert. We relieved each other every  twenty-four hours, at noon precisely. As has always been my rule when  thrown into association with strangers, I observed, as closely as  circumstances permitted, the character and temper of my comrades, so  that I could regulate my conduct in regard to them, and know in advance  what I might have to fear or hope from association with them.    Hambard had an unbounded devotion for the First Consul, whom he had  followed to Egypt, but unfortunately his temper was gloomy and  misanthropic, which made "]]]
