[Illustration: THE FORCE OF TREE GROWTH.]    The disruptive power of tree roots, growing in the crevices of rocks,  is well known. Masses of stone weighing many tons are often dislodged  in this way from the faces of cliffs, and no one gives them more than  a passing glance. When, however, the sanctity of the tomb is  invaded, despite the graven warning of the occupant, the case is very  different, and superstitious people are apt to think there must be  something in it more than accident and the unconscious expression of  the resistless force of growing vegetation.    The engraving herewith is copied from a photograph sent to us by  a European correspondent, of a grave in the Garten churchyard, in  Hanover, Germany, the invasion of which by a birch tree has been the  occasion of much wonderment by country people, who come from great  distances to examine it.    The monument, so unfeelingly disrupted, was erected in 1782, and bears  on its base the following inscription: \"This grave, which was bought  for all eternity, must never be opened.\" A chance birch seed, lodging  in a crevice of the monument, has displayed the irony of nature in  slowly yet surely thwarting the desire of the person who designed it  for a perpetual memorial. All the joints are separated, the strong  iron clamps are broken, and the birch tree has embraced the upper  large block, which weighs about one and a quarter tons, and the  tree is driving its roots below, gradually but surely tilting the  structure.           *       *       *       *       *          PERSEVERANCE WITH THE DROWNED.    In a recent communication to the French Academy, Professor Fort  asserts that he was enabled to restore to life a child three years  old, by practicing artificial respiration on it four hours, commencing  three hours and a half after apparent death. He mentions also a case  in which Dr. Fournol, of Billancourt, reanimated, in July, 1878, an  apparently drowned person by four hours of artificial respiration  begun one hour after the patient was taken from the water. At this  season, when cases of drowning are apt to be frequent, the possible  benefit that may come from a persevering effort to revive victims  of drowning, should encourage friends not to despair of their  resuscitation, even after several hours of seemingly fruitless labor.           *       *       *       *       *          SIMPLE TEST FOR CHLORAL HYDRATE.    A new test for chloral hydrate has been devised by Frank Ogston,  namely, yellow sulphide of ammonium. On adding this reagent to a  solution of chloral of moderate strength there is at first no change  noticed, but in a short time the colorless solution acquires an orange  yellow color, and on longer standing turns brown and evolves a gas  of very disagreeable odor. Ogston's experiments show that a solution  containing ten milligrammes turns brown in six hours, and gives the  peculiar odor. With one milligramme the orange-yellow color appears  in twelve hours, but no odor. Croton chloral gives the same reactions,  but chloroform, chloric ether, and formic acid do not.           *       *       *       *       *          NATURAL HISTORY NOTES.    _The Propagation of Oysters._--At the recent meeting in this city  of the American Fish Cultural Association, a paper was read on the  propagation of the oyster, by Dr. W. J. Brook, of the Johns Hopkins  University. The manner in which this propagation takes place had never  before, he said, been thoroughly understood. Through studies made by  him last summer, however, great light was thrown on the subject. He  found that the American oysters do not breed their young in the  shell, as had been supposed, and that consequently the eggs can be  impregnated artificially. An average oyster contains from six to nine  million eggs, and one of large size may contain fifty millions. The  plan pursued by him in fertilizing these eggs was to chop the male  and female oyster up together; thus the fluids are mixed and the  impregnation is made complete. The process of development immediately  begins, and goes on so rapidly that a change may be noted every  fifteen seconds. In a very few hours the embryo is sufficiently formed  to swim in the water. The shells at first are very small, and are not  adjacent to each other. They grow very rapidly, closing down over the  sides, and finally unite and form the hinge. In the short space of  twenty-four hours the young oyster is able to take food, and from  three days to a week it attains perfect form. During its early life it  is a swimming animal. The oyster is able to reproduce its species at  the end of a year's growth, and it is marketable at the age of three  years.           *       *       *       *       *          S. P. RUGGLES.    S. P. Ruggles died at Lisbon, N. H., May 28. He was principally known  as the inventor of the Ruggles printing press, which was among the  first of machine presses. His invention was what printers call an  \"upside-down press,\" the type being upside down when in the bed. About  twenty-five years ago Mr. Ruggles sold out his interest for nearly  $200,000, and since then has not been in active business. He was the  inventor of the raised alphabet for the blind, and always showed great  interest in the amelioration of the condition of the sightless. He was  also a great friend of mechanical education, and has written much on  the subject.           *       *       *       *       *          SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.--1879-1880.

In presenting the following report, the judges desire to make some  explanations, which, we trust, will excuse them in the minds of the  impartial for any apparent neglect in the form of their report, and  for the limited number of tests made of the horological exhibits.    The judges were appointed too late to do the full amount required,  inasmuch as the number of exhibits was so much in excess of any  reasonable allotment for examination and report before the closing of  the Exhibition.    Commencing their labors, however, immediately after the first  call, the examinations were not complete until March 3d, which only  permitted a time test to be made of nine days in a single position.  This single position was objected to by some of the exhibitors,  but ill-advisedly, for the ratings observed in the watches of the  objecting exhibitors were of such character as to establish in the  minds of the judges the conclusion that their watches would not have  made so good a comparative showing if there had been more time to  observe the ratings in other positions.    Great care was taken by the individual judges in making up their note  books during the examination of the watches, and scrutinizing the  inherent and comparative merits of exhibits under the ten different  heads unanimously agreed upon, as follows:    1. Originality.  2. Invention and discovery.  3. Utility and quality of material.  4. Skill in workmanship.  5. Fitness for purposes intended.  6. Adaptation to public wants.  7. Economy.  8. Cost.  9. Finish and elegance of cases.  10. Time-keeping qualities.    It was agreed the judges should use the number 100 as expressing the  highest degree of excellence in each of these ten elements of inherent  and comparative merit, and adjudge individually to each of the several  exhibits such rating as their respective judgments would warrant after  careful examination; each set of opinions being made a portion of  this report, and in the _resume_ the mean average being taken as the  unanimous verdict of the judges.    It was also decided we should take up each exhibit in the order  originally examined, and, beginning with the first element of merit  (originality), each judge should in numbers express his judgment of  the inherent and comparative merit attaching to each exhibit in this  one element; this being done, to proceed with each succeeding element  in order and in the same manner. The five judgments being complete and  in numbers, the aggregated verdict is arrived at simply by addition  and division.    This is not only a verdict as to the inherent and comparative merits  of each exhibit, but also a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38516"],[0,"The Children's Life of the Bee (#9)"],[1,"to be noted among  the bees which make it quite certain that they can tell each other  things that go much further than a mere yes or no. In the hive, for  instance, the wonderful way in which they divide up their work, the way  in which the work is combined, one bee holding herself in readiness to  take the place of another who has finished her own particular job and is  waiting for her--these things all prove that they must be able to let  each other know. I have often marked bees that went out in the morning  collecting food; and found that, in the afternoon, if there was no  special abundance of flowers, these same bees would take on another job  altogether; would either be fanning and heating the brood-cells, or  perhaps adding themselves to the mysterious, motionless curtain in whose  midst the sculptors and waxmakers would be at work. In the same way I  have found that bees which for one whole day would be gathering nothing  but pollen would, on the next, evidently in obedience to some order that  had been given, devote themselves entirely to the search for nectar.      Day after day, the sun will scarcely have risen when the explorers of  the dawn return to the hive, which awakes to receive the glad tidings of  what is happening on the earth. \"The lime-trees are blossoming to-day on  the banks of the canal.\" \"The grass by the roadside is gay with white  clover.\", \"The sage and the lotus are about to open.\" \"The mignonette,  the lilies, are overflowing with pollen.\" The news is handed in to  headquarters, and arrangements are quickly made to divide up the work.  Five thousand of the strongest and most active will be sent to the  lime-trees, while three thousand juniors sally forth to the clover.  Those who yesterday were gathering nectar will to-day give a rest to  their tongues and the glands of their sac, and will bring back red  pollen from the mignonette or yellow pollen from the tall lilies; for  you will never find a bee gathering or mixing up pollens of a different  color or species, and indeed it is one of the special cares of the hive  to keep the different-hued pollens apart in separate store-rooms.    The workers set out, in long black files, each one flying straight to  its own particular task. George de Layens stoutly declares that they  have been told where to go to, and which flowers they are to visit; that  they are aware how much nectar each flower will give, and know its  precise value. It is their business to collect the greatest possible  amount of honey; and if we watch the different directions in which the  bees fly, we will find that they divide themselves up most carefully  among the flowers which offer the best chance of a prosperous harvest.  As these vary day by day, so will the different orders be given. In the  spring, for instance, when the fields are still bare, the bees will  flock to the flowers in the woods, and eagerly visit the gorse and the  violets, langworts and anemones. But, a few days later, when cabbage and  colza are beginning to flower, the bees will turn their attention to  these alone, neglecting the woods almost entirely, for all the abundance  that still may be found there. They know that the colza and cabbage  flowers are richer in honey, and therefore give them the preference;  thus deciding, day by day, what plants they shall visit, their one idea  being to amass the greatest value of treasure in the least possible  time.      You may ask, perhaps, what does it matter to us whether the bees have or  have not a real intelligence of their own? I think that it matters a  very great deal. If we could be quite certain that other creatures  beside ourselves are able to think or to reason it would give us  something of the emotion that came over Robinson Crusoe when he saw the  print of a human foot on the sandy shore of his island. Like him, we  should seem less alone. And when we study, when we try to understand,  the intelligence of the bees, we are at the same time trying to  understand what is the most wonderful thing in ourselves; the power that  enables the will to effect its purpose, and overcome obstacles in its  way.      We will now go on with the story of the hive, take it up where we left  it, and lift a fold of the curtain of bees which are hanging, head  downwards, from the dome. A curious kind of sweat, as white as snow and  airier than the down on the wing of a bird, is beginning to show itself.  This is the wax that is forming; but it is unlike the wax that we know;  it has no weight, it is amazingly pure, being, as it were, the soul of  the honey, which is itself the essence of the flowers.    It is very difficult to follow, stage by stage, the manufacture of wax  by the swarm, or even the use to which they put it, for all this comes  to pass in the very blackest depth of the mass of bees all huddled  together. We know that the honey in the sac of the bees that are  clinging to each other turns itself into wax, but we have no idea how  this is done. All we can tell is that they will stay in this position,  never stirring or making the least movement, for eighteen or twenty-four  hours, and that the hive becomes so hot that it is almost as though a  fire had been lit. And then at last white and transparent scales show  themselves at the opening of four little pockets that every bee has  underneath its stomach.    When the bodies of most of the bees forming the curtain have thus been  adorned with ivory tablets, we shall suddenly see one of them detach  herself from the crowd, and eagerly, hurriedly, clamber over the backs  of the motionless crowd till she has reached the top of the dome. To  this she will fix herself firmly, banging away with her head at those of  her neighbors who seem to interfere with her movements. Then, she will  seize with her mouth and her claws one of the scales that hang from her  body, and set to work at it like a carpenter planing a soft piece of  wood. She will pull it out, flatten it, bend it and roll it, moistening  it with her tongue and licking it into shape; and, when at last she has  got it to be just what she wanted, she will fix it to the highest point  of the dome, thus laying the stone, the foundation, of the new city; for  we have here a city that is being built downwards from the sky, and not  from the earth upwards, like the cities of men. To this beginning she  will add other morsels of wax, which she takes from beneath her belt;  and at last, with one final lick of the tongue, one last touch of her  feelers, she will go, as suddenly as she came, and disappear among the  crowd. Another bee will at once take her place, carry on the work from  the point where the first has left it; she will go through her own  carpentering, just like her sister, and add to or improve the first  one's job if she thinks this is called for. And then a third will  follow, a fourth and a fifth, all coming from different corners, all  eager and earnest, till numbers and numbers have taken their turn, none  of them finishing the work but each adding her share to the task in  which all combine.      A small lump of wax, as yet quite formless, hangs down from the top of  the hive. As soon as it is sufficiently thick, we shall see another bee  coming out of the mass. This one is very sure of herself, puts on a  little side as it were; and she is watched very closely by the eager  crowd below. She is one of the sculptors or carvers; she does not make  any wax herself, her job being to deal with the material which the  others have provided. She marks out the first cell, settles where it  shall be; digs into the block for a moment, putting the wax she has  taken out from the hole on the borders around it; and then she goes,  making way for another, who is impatiently waiting her turn, and will go  on with the work that a third will continue, while others close by are  digging away at the wax on the opposite side. And very soon we shall be  able to see the outline of the new comb. In shape it will be something  like our own tongue, if you can imagine this to be made up of little  six-sided cells, which all lie back to back. When the first cells have  been built, the architects put on the ceiling, and then start building a  second row, and a third and a fourth, and so on, gallery on the top of  gallery, and the dimensions so carefully worked out that there will  always be ample space, when the comb is finished, for the bees to move  freely between its walls.    It happens, however, sometimes that a mistake has been made; that too  much space, or too little, will have been left between the combs. The  bees will do the best they can to set matters right; they will slant the  one comb that is too near the other, or fill up the space that has been  left with a new comb specially shaped.      The bees build four different kinds of cells. There are the royal cells,  rather like an acorn in shape; the large cells in which the males are  reared, and provisions stored when flowers are plentiful; the small  cells used as cradles for the workerbees and also as ordinary  store-rooms. These last are the most common kind, and about four-fifths  of the buildings will be composed of them. Then there are also a certain  number of what are known as \"transition-cells,\" irregular in shape,  which connect the larger cells with the smaller.    Each cell, with the exception of the transition ones, is worked out  absolutely to scale, with extraordinary accuracy. It is a kind of  six-sided tube, and two layers of these tubes form the comb. It is in  these tubes that the honey is stored; and to prevent it from spilling,  the bees tilt the tubes slightly forward. Each cell is solidly built,  and the position of one to the other has been carefully thought out and  arranged. Indeed, such wonderful skill and ingenuity is shown in the  construction of the cells that it is difficult to believe that instinct  alone is sufficient to account for it. The wasps,"]]]
