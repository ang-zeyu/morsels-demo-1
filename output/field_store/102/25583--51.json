[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33044"],[0,"Birds from North Borneo (#9)"],[1,"illot): Wrinkled Hornbill.--On October 3,  1962, a pair was seen in the primary forest at the Cocoa Research  Station.    _=Aceros undulatus undulatus=_ (Shaw): Wreathed Hornbill.--_Specimens_,  2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum 5 mm., October 2, 1962,  MCT 2981; [Male] testis 10 x 11 mm., October 2, 1962, MCT 2982.         This, the most common hornbill at Quoin Hill and at Kalabakan,       occurred in primary forest.    _=Anthracoceros malayanus=_ (Raffles): Black Hornbill.--A flock of five  was seen at the Cocoa Research Station rest house on September 6 and 13,  1962.    _=Buceros rhinoceros=_ Linnaeus: Rhinoceros Hornbill.--It was fairly  common at the Cocoa Research Station, where several were observed in  July and August.    _=Rhinoplax vigil=_ (Forster): Helmeted Hornbill.--The Helmeted Hornbill  was rarely observed, but almost every day we heard its call when we were  on the east coast. It was also heard in the forest on the west coast  around Tenom, but is not common there owing to hunting by the natives.  Skulls of this and the preceding species were on sale in a shop at  Tenom, despite laws prohibiting the killing of these species.    _=Calorhamphus fuliginosus tertius=_ Chasen and Kloss: Brown  Barbet.--_Specimens_, 7: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum 2  mm., 38.8 gm., brood patch, July 7, 1962, MCT 2610; [Female], 40.0 gm.,  August 1, 1962, MCT 2702; [Female], 44.8 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2703;  [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., September 25, 1962 (paired with MCT 2956), MCT  2955; [Female], September 1, 1962, MCT 2846, [Female], September 25,  1962, MCT 2956; [Female]?, November 30, 1962, MCT 3436.         These barbets were common at the Cocoa Research Station both in       secondary forest and cocoa, usually in groups of three or four.       They were seen also at Kalabakan where the birds fed in the top of       a 100-foot tree in the primary forest.         In describing this bird, Smythies (1960:322) said the male's bill       is black. The one male that I took had an orange bill and at no       time did I observe any black-billed birds at the Cocoa Research       Station; this black bill perhaps is a character of the subspecies       _C. f. fuliginosus_.    _=Megalaima henrici brachyrhyncha=_ Neumann: Yellow-crowned  Barbet.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 72.8 gm.,  August 1, 1962, MCT 2696; [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., 83.2 gm., August 2,  1962, MCT 2705; [Male] testis 6 x 5 mm., 73.7 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT  2706.         This barbet was common at the Cocoa Research Station and its call       could be heard at any time of day until dusk. Smythies (1960:324)       described this call as _took-took-took-took-trrrroook_. All birds       of this species that I watched and listened to, however, were       calling thus: _trrrroook-took-took-took-took_. The number of       _tooks_ varies, but is generally four and can be as high as seven.       This species was heard at all stations on the east coast. At       Kalabakan, one was heard calling all day long from the top of a       70-foot tree.         Comparison of my specimens with those in the U. S. National Museum       revealed that _M. h. brachyrhyncha_ was readily distinguishable       from the nominate race by measurements. The average length of bill       in my specimens was 23 mm., whereas the average length in two       specimens from Sumatra and Siam in the U. S. National Museum was 27       mm. The Bornean specimens differ also in having the blue patch on       the head larger and darker than in _M. h. henrici_. _M. h.       brachyrhyncha_ certainly seems to be a valid race on the basis of       the available specimens.    _=Megalaima chrysopogon chrysopsis=_ Goffin: Gold-whiskered  Barbet.--_Specimens_, 10: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ovum  2 mm., 164.4 gm., July 21, 1962, MCT 2627; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm.,  156.0 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2697; [Female], 177.2 gm., August 1,  1962, MCT 2701; [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm., 172.6 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT  2717; ?, 182.2 gm., August 2, 1962, MCT 2718; [Female], 181.5 gm., MCT  2721; [Male] testis 10 x 8 mm., 148.5 gm., August 8, 1962, MCT 2741;  [Male], June 23, 1963, ADG 155; [Female], May 25, 1963, ADG 109. Tiger  Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT 3324.         Next to the Brown Barbet, this was perhaps the most common barbet       at the Cocoa Research Station and was often the only bird heard in       the heat of the day. On three occasions birds were observed       clinging to the side of a tree as a woodpecker might, pecking away       at dead wood. This species was seen both in the cocoa and primary       forest.    _=Megalaima mystacophanes mystacophanes=_ (Temminck): Gaudy  Barbet.--_Specimens_, 8: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 60.3 gm.,  July 25, 1962; [Male] testis 8 x 5 mm., 79.2 gm., August 9, 1962, MCT  2749; [Male] testis 9 x 5 mm., September 1, 1962, MCT 2845; [Female],  September 25, 1962, MCT 2950; [Female], April 30, 1963, ADG 88. 12 mi. N  Kalabakan: [Male], October 20, 1962, MCT 3103. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male]  testis 8 x 6 mm., December 25, 1962, MCT 3530; [Female], December 25,  1962, MCT 3537.         This common bird lived in the secondary and primary forest and       cocoa. I saw it at all localities. At least two calls were given by       this species. One was a simple _took_ with a long pause between       calls; the other was as described by Smythies (1960:323).         The birds fed from high in trees down to nearly ground level. This       species like _M. chrysopogon_, clung to the sides of trees and       pecked at dead wood.    _=Megalaima australis duvauceli=_ (Lesson): Little Barbet.--_Specimens_,  3: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 7 x 5 mm., 35.2 gm., August 1,  1962, MCT 2692; [Male] testis 9 x 5 mm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2699;  [Female] ovary granular, 33.0 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2704.         I was unable to make detailed observations on this species. All       specimens were taken from a high feeding tree, where it was       impossible to identify them before hand.    _=Indicator archipelagicus=_ Temminck: Malaysian  Honey-guide.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] ovary  minute, 29 November 1962, MCT 3394. Tenom: [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm.,  January 5, 1963, MCT 3580.         The specimen from the Cocoa Research Station was taken in a net in       the cocoa and the Tenom bird was taken in a net in the middle of       Tenom, both in garden areas. These two specimens differ in       coloration from Bornean birds in the U. S. National Museum; I think       the difference results from \"foxing\" of the older specimens.       Specimens have been taken previously in North Borneo on the       Bengkoka River, Lumbidan, and on the Mengalong River (Smythies,       1957:669). Mary Norman saw this honey-guide once at the Quoin       Estate in 1962 (Smythies, 1963:279).    _=Sasia abnormis=_ (Temminck): Rufous Piculet.--_Specimens_, 13: Cocoa  Research Station: [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm., molting, July 10, 1962, MCT  2612; [Female], September 24, 1962, MCT 2940; [Female], December 1,  1962, MCT 3411; [Male], July 9, 1963, ADG 177; [Male], July 7, 1963, ADG  166; [Male], June 14, 1963, ADG 135. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female],  October 17, 1962, MCT 3061. 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Male], December 19, 1962,  MCT 3470; [Female], December 23, 1962, MCT 3517; [Male], December 24,  1962, MCT 3529; [Female], December 27, 1962, MCT 3541. Oil Palm Research  Station: [Female], August 24, 1963, ADG 257; [Male], August 15, 1963,  ADG 242.         The piculet was common in the secondary undergrowth near the Cocoa       Research Station, and was taken once in the primary forest. One       bird was seen sitting on a small branch about 10 feet up at a right       angle to the branch. It did not ascend the tree like a woodpecker.       This species was also taken in the moss forest near Tenom.    _=Picus puniceus observandus=_ (Hartert): Crimson-winged  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 65.8 gm.,  July 27, 1962, MCT 2671; [Male], September 27, 1962, MCT 2973.         This woodpecker was observed twice, both times in primary forest at       the Cocoa Research Station.    _=Picus mentalis humei=_ (Hargitt): Checkered-throated  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 93.3  gm., July 23, 1962, MCT 2642; sex?, 107.0 gm., August 5, 1962, MCT 2733.         I saw this bird only twice, in primary forest.    _=Picus miniaceus malaccensis=_ Latham: Banded Red  Woodpecker.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 8 x 5  mm., 79.5 gm., August 4, 1962, MCT 2722.         On August 4 I saw two birds of this species together in badly       disturbed primary forest and took the specimen listed above.    _=Micropternus brachyurus badiosus=_ (Bonaparte): Rufous  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 5: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] brood  patch, 4 to 5 old collapsed follicles, 73.2 gm., July 3, 1962, MCT 2584;  [Female], 65.4 gm., July 25, 1962, MCT 2658; [Male] testis 2 x 1 mm.,  66.7 gm., July 25, 1962, MCT 2659. Tiger Estate: [Male], June 23, 1963,  ADG 158; [Female], June 23, 1963, ADG 159.         I saw this woodpecker but twice, both times at the Cocoa Research       Station. A female taken from a dead tree in the cocoa may have been       just finishing nesting activities, judging from the size of the       ova. A pair seen feeding on the ground near a brush pile in       secondary forest was collected. The stomachs contained ants.    _=Dendrocopos canicapillus aurantiiventris=_ (Salvadori): Oriental Pygmy  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: sex?, July 22,  1962, MCT 2635; [Male] testis 3 x 2 mm., 23.5 gm., molting, August 25,  1962, MCT 2807.         On July 22 four individuals were feeding on dead trees in the       cocoa. They made a _cheep cheep_ sound, rattling calls, and       drummed. On August 25, 1962, two were feeding in dead trees in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#9)"],[1,"eoples, but they are addicted to much drinking of  rice-spirit. Their social organisation is very loose, their chiefs  having but little authority. Besides those who call themselves Muruts,  we class under the same general name several tribes which we regard as  closely allied to them; namely, the Adangs in the head of the Limbang;  the Kalabits about the head of the Baram; the Sabans and Kerayans at  the head of the Kerayan river; the Libuns; the Lepu Asings at the  head of the Bahau; Tagals and Dusuns in the most northerly part;  the Trings of the Barau and Balungan rivers on the east.    (6) The Punans, among whom we include, beside the Punans proper, the  Ukits and a few other closely allied but widely scattered small groups,  are the only people who do not dwell in villages established on the  banks of the rivers. They live in small groups of twenty or thirty  persons, which wander in the jungle. Each such group is generally  made up of a chief and his descendants. The group will spend a few  weeks or months at a time in one spot (to which generally they are  attracted by the presence of wild sago), dwelling in rude shelters of  sticks and leaves, and then moving on, but generally remaining within  some one area, such as the basin of one of the upper tributaries  of a large river. They are found throughout the interior of Borneo,  but are difficult to meet with, as they remain hidden in the depths  of the forests. Unlike all the other peoples, they cultivate no PADI  (rice), and they do not make boats or travel on the rivers. They  support themselves by hunting with the blow-pipe, by gathering  the wild jungle fruits, and by collecting the jungle products and  bartering them with the more settled peoples. In physical characters  they closely resemble the Kenyahs, being well-built and vigorous;  their skin is of very light yellow colour, and their features are  regular and well shaped. Mentally they are characterised by extreme  shyness and timidity and reserve. They are quite inoffensive and never  engage in open warfare; though they will avenge injuries by stealthy  attacks on individuals with the blow-pipe and poisoned darts. Their  only handicrafts are the making of baskets, mats, blow-pipes, and the  implements used for working the wild sago; but in these and in the use  of the blow-pipe they are very expert. All other manufactured articles  used by them -- cloths, swords, spears -- are obtained by barter from  the other peoples. Unlike all the other peoples, they have no form of  sepulture, but simply leave the corpse of a comrade in the rude shelter  in which he died. They sing and declaim rude melancholy songs or dirges  with peculiar skill and striking effect. Their language is distinctive,  but is apparently allied to the Kenyah and Klemantan tongues.    We propose to deal with the topics of each of our descriptive chapters  by giving as full as possible an account of the Kayans, and adding to  this some observations as to the principal diversities of custom and  culture presented by the other peoples. For, if we should attempt  to describe in detail each of these peoples with all their local  diversities, this book would attain an inordinate length. The Kayans  are in most respects the most homogeneous of these peoples, the  most conservative and distinctive, and present perhaps the richest  and most interesting body of belief and custom and art; while many  of their customs and arts have been adopted by their neighbours,  or are indigenous with them.    We may conclude this chapter by describing briefly in general terms  the physical characters, and the habits and customs that are common  to all or most of these pagan tribes.    These peoples present no very great differences of physical  character. All are of medium height; their skin-colour ranges from  a rich medium brown to a very pale CAFE-AU-LAIT, hardly deeper than  the colour of cream. Their hair is nearly black or very dark brown,  and generally quite lank, but in some cases wavy or even almost  curly. Their faces show in nearly all cases, though in very diverse  degrees, some of the well-known mongoloid characters, the wide  cheek-bones, the small oblique eyes, the peculiar fold of the upper  eyelid at its nasal end, and the scanty beard. In some individuals  these traces are very slight and in fact not certainly perceptible. The  nose varies greatly in shape, but is usually rather wide at the  nostrils, and in very many cases the plane of the nostrils is tilted  a little upwards and forwards. On the other hand some individuals,  especially among the Kenyahs, have distinctly aquiline and well-formed  noses. Amongst all these peoples, especially the Kenyahs, Punans,  and Klemantans, there are to be seen a few individuals of very regular  well-shaped features of European type.    Although as regards physical characters all these peoples have much in  common, yet each of them presents peculiarities which are obvious to  the eye of an experienced observer, and enable him without hesitation  to assign to their proper groups the majority of individuals; and  such recognition on mere inspection is of course rendered easier by  the relatively slight peculiarities of dress and ornament proper to  each group.    The pure-bred Kenyah presents, perhaps, the most clearly marked as  well as the finest physical type. His skin, is the colour of rich  cream with a very small dash of coffee. The hair of his head varies  from slightly wavy to curly, and is never very abundant or long in the  men. The rest of his body is almost free from hair, and what little  grows upon the face is carefully plucked out (not, leaving even the  eyebrows and eyelashes). This practice is common to all the peoples of  the interior except the Sea Dayaks. His stature is about 1600 mm.; his  weight about 136 pounds. His limbs are distinctly short in proportion  to his body; his trunk is well developed and square, and both limbs  and trunk are well covered with rounded muscles. His movements are  quick and vigorous, and he is hardy and capable of sustaining prolonged  toil and hardship. His head is moderately round (Index 79), his face  broad but well shaped. The expression of his face is bold and open.    The Kayan has a rather darker skin of a redder tone. His legs are not  so disproportionately short, but in all other respects his body is less  well proportioned, graceful, and active than the Kenyah's. His features  are less regular and rather coarser and heavier; his expression is  serious, reserved, and cautious.    The Murut is nearly as fair skinned as the Kenyah, perhaps a little  ruddier in tone. His most characteristic feature is the length of his  leg and lack of calf, in both of which respects he contrasts strongly  with the Kenyah. The length of his leg raises his stature above the  average. His intonation is characteristic, namely, somewhat whining;  whereas the Kenyah's speech is crisp and staccato.    The Klemantans present a greater variety of physical types, being  a less homogeneous group. Roughly they may be said to present all  transitions from the Kenyah to the Murut type. In the main they are  less muscular and active than the Kenyah. It is amongst them that  the upward and forward direction of the plane of the nostrils is  most marked.    The Punan presents, again, a well-marked type. His skin is even fairer  than the Kenyah's, and is distinguished by a distinctly greenish  tinge. He is well proportioned, graceful, and muscular, and his  features are in many cases very regular and pleasing. His expression  is habitually melancholy and strikingly wary and timid. In spite of  his homeless nomadic life he generally appears well nourished and  clean, and he seems less subject to sores and to the skin diseases  which so often disfigure the other peoples, especially the Muruts,  Kayans, and Sea Dayaks.[29]    All these peoples, with the exception of the Punans and similar nomads,  live in village communities situated with few exceptions on the banks  of the rivers. The populations of these villages vary from 20 or 30  persons only in the smallest, to 1500 or even more in a few of the  largest; while the average village comprises about 30 families which,  with a few slaves and dependants, make a community of some 200 to 300  persons. Each such community is presided over by a chief. A number of  villages of one people are commonly grouped within easy reach of one  another on the banks of a river. But no people exclusively occupies  or claims exclusive possession of any one territory or waterway. With  the exception of the Sea Dayaks, all these different peoples may here  and there be found in closely adjoining villages; and in some rivers  the villages of the different peoples are freely intermingled over  considerable areas. The segregation of the Sea Dayak villages seems  to be due to the truculent treacherous nature of the Sea Dayak,  which renders him obnoxious as a neighbour to the other peoples,  and leads him to feel the need of the support of his own people in  large numbers. All find their principal support and occupation in the  cultivation of PADI (rice), and all supplement this with the breeding  of a few pigs and fowls and, in the north of the island, buffalo,  with hunting and fishing, and with the collection of jungle produce  -- gutta-percha, rubber, rattan canes, camphor, sago. These jungle  products they barter or sell for cash to the Malay and Chinese traders.    They have no written records, and but vague traditions of their  past history and migrations. There is no political organisation  beyond a loose coherence and alliance for defence and offence of the  village communities of any one people in neighbouring parts of the  country -- a coherence which at times is greatly strengthened by the  personal ascendency of the chief of some one village over neighbouring  chiefs. One of the most notable examples of such personal ascendency"]]]
