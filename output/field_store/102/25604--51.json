Under the  immediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would  occur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of  the snowy almond-tree. The constant shade in my study has delayed the  awakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,  which synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme. We now have, around  my working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a buzzing  crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment. I enjoin the  household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects' laboratory, to  do no more sweeping, no more dusting. They might disturb the swarm and  make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted. I suspect that  the maid, wounded in her self-esteem at seeing so much dust accumulating  in the master's study, did not always respect my prohibitions and came  in stealthily, now and again, to give a little sweep of the broom.  At any rate, I came across a number of Osmiae who seemed to have been  crushed under foot while taking a sunbath on the floor in front of the  window. Perhaps it was I myself who committed the misdeed in a heedless  moment. There is no great harm done, for the population is a numerous  one; and, notwithstanding those crushed by inadvertence, notwithstanding  the parasites wherewith many of the cocoons are infested,  notwithstanding those who may have come to grief outside or been unable  to find their way back, notwithstanding the deduction of one-half which  we must make for the males: notwithstanding all this, during four or  five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae which is much too  large to allow of my watching their individual operations. I content  myself with a few, whom I mark with different-coloured spots to  distinguish them; and I take no notice of the others, whose finished  work will have my attention later.    The first to appear are the males. If the sun is bright, they flutter  around the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;  blows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing  on the floor, then shake the dust off their wings and fly away. I find  them, opposite my window, in the refreshment-bar of the lilac-bush,  whose branches bend with the weight of their scented panicles. Here the  Bees get drunk with sunshine and draughts of honey. Those who have had  their fill come home and fly assiduously from tube to tube, placing  their heads in the orifices to see if some female will at last make up  her mind to emerge.    One does, in point of fact. She is covered with dust and has the  disordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the  deliverance. A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.  All crowd round her. The lady responds to their advances by clashing her  mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in succession. The  suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to keep up their  dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces. Then the beauty retires  into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on the threshold. A  fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play with her jaws; a  fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can to flourish their  own pincers. The Osmiae have a strange way of declaring their passion:  with that fearsome gnashing of their mandibles, the lovers look as  though they meant to devour each other. It suggests the thumps affected  by our yokels in their moments of gallantry.    The ingenious idyll is soon over. By turns greeting and greeted with a  clash of jaws, the female leaves her gallery and begins impassively to  polish her wings. The rivals rush forward, hoist themselves on top of  one another and form a pyramid of which each struggles to occupy the  base by toppling over the favoured lover. He, however, is careful not  to let go; he waits for the strife overhead to calm down; and, when the  supernumeraries realize that they are wasting their time and throw up  the game, the couple fly away far from the turbulent rivals. This is all  that I have been able to gather about the Osmia's nuptials.    The females, who grow more numerous from day to day, inspect the  premises; they buzz outside the glass galleries and the reed dwellings;  they go in, stay for a while, come out, go in again and then fly away  briskly into the garden. They return, first one, then another. They halt  outside, in the sun, on the shutters fastened back against the wall;  they hover in the window-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a  glance at them, only to set off again and to return soon after. Thus  do they learn to know their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in  their memory. The village of our childhood is always a cherished spot,  never to be effaced from our recollection. The Osmia's life endures  for a month; and she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in  a couple of days. 'Twas there that she was born; 'twas there that she  loved; 'tis there that she will return. Dulces reminiscitur Argos. ('Now  falling by another's wound, his eyes He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks  and dies.'--\"Aeneid,\" Book 10 Dryden's translation.)    At last each has made her choice. The work of construction begins; and  my expectations are fulfilled far beyond my wishes. The Osmiae build  nests in all the retreats which I have placed at their disposal. The  glass tubes, which I cover with a sheet of paper to produce the shade  and mystery favourable to concentrated toil, do wonderfully well. All,  from first to last, are occupied. The Osmiae quarrel for the possession  of these crystal palaces, hitherto unknown to their race. The reeds  and the paper tubes likewise do wonderfully. The number provided is  too small; and I hasten to increase it. Snail-shells are recognized as  excellent abodes, though deprived of the shelter of the stone-heap; old  Chalicodoma-nests, down to those of the Chalicodoma of the Shrubs (Cf.  \"The Mason-bees\": chapters 4 and 10.--Translator's Note.), whose cells  are so small, are eagerly occupied. The late-comers, finding nothing  else free, go and settle in the locks of my table-drawers. There are  daring ones who make their way into half-open boxes containing ends of  glass tubes in which I have stored my most recent acquisitions: grubs,  pupae and cocoons of all kinds, whose evolution I wished to study.  Whenever these receptacles have an atom of free space, they claim the  right to build there, whereas I formally oppose the claim. I hardly  reckoned on such a success, which obliges me to put some order into  the invasion with which I am threatened. I seal up the locks, I shut my  boxes, I close my various receptacles for old nests, in short I remove  from the building-yard any retreat of which I do not approve. And now, O  my Osmiae, I leave you a free field!    The work begins with a thorough spring-cleaning of the home. Remnants  of cocoons, dirt consisting of spoilt honey, bits of plaster from broken  partitions, remains of dried Mollusc at the bottom of a shell: these and  much other insanitary refuse must first of all disappear. Violently the  Osmia tugs at the offending object and tears it out; and then off she  goes, in a desperate hurry, to dispose of it far away from the study.  They are all alike, these ardent sweepers: in their excessive zeal, they  fear lest they should block up the place with a speck of dust which they  might drop in front of the new house. The glass tubes, which I myself  have rinsed under the tap, are not exempt from a scrupulous cleaning.  The Osmia dusts them, brushes them thoroughly with her tarsi and then  sweeps them out backwards. What does she pick up? Not a thing. It makes  no difference: as a conscientious housewife, she gives the place a touch  of the broom nevertheless.    Now for the provisions and the partition-walls. Here the order of the  work changes according to the diameter of the cylinder. My glass tubes  vary greatly in dimensions. The largest have an inner width of a dozen  millimetres (Nearly half an inch.--Translator's Note.); the narrowest  measure six or seven. (About a quarter of an inch.--Translator's Note.)  In the latter, if the bottom suit her, the Osmia sets to work bringing  pollen and honey. If the bottom do not suit her, if the sorghum-pith  plug with which I have closed the rear-end of the tube be too irregular  and badly-joined, the Bee coats it with a little mortar. When this small  repair is made, the harvesting begins.    In the wider tubes, the work proceeds quite differently. At the moment  when the Osmia disgorges her honey and especially at the moment when,  with her hind-tarsi, she rubs the pollen-dust from her ventral brush,  she needs a narrow aperture, just big enough to allow of her passage.  I imagine that, in a straitened gallery, the rubbing of her whole body  against the sides gives the harvester a support for her brushing-work.  In a spacious cylinder, this support fails her; and the Osmia starts  with creating one for herself, which she does by narrowing the channel.  Whether it be to facilitate the storing of the victuals or for any other  reason, the fact remains that the Osmia housed in a wide tube begins  with the partitioning.    Her division is made by a dab of clay placed at right angles to the  axis of the cylinder, at a distance from the bottom determined by the  ordinary length of a cell. This wad is not a complete round; it is more  crescent-shaped, leaving a circular space between it and one side of the  tube. Fresh layers are swiftly added to the dab of clay; and soon the  tube is divided by a partition which has a circular opening at the side  of it, a sort of dog-hole through which the Osmia will proceed to knead  the Bee-bread. When the victualling is finished and the egg laid upon  the heap, the hole is closed and the filled-up partition becomes the  bottom of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#9)"],[1,"oil. If the weather was fine, they  passed directly from the Thermae into the gymnasium, and engaged in some  gentle exercise previous to taking the midday meal. Between two and three  in the afternoon was the favorite hour for this ancient luxury. Swimming  was a favorite exercise, and a knowledge of it was regarded as necessary to  every educated man. Their common expression, when speaking of an ignorant  person, was, \"He can neither read nor swim.\"    [Sidenote: 30. The Sun-bath? The story of Pliny?]    30. THE SUN-BATH.--Some also were accustomed daily to anoint themselves,  and lie or walk in apartments arranged for the purpose, with naked bodies  exposed to the direct rays of the sun. There is an interesting allusion to  this practice, in a letter of the younger Pliny to the historian Tacitus,  describing the destruction of Pompeii by an eruption of Vesuvius. \"My  uncle,\" (Pliny the elder,) \"was at that time in command of the fleet at  Misenum. On the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother  desired him to notice a cloud which seemed of unusual shape and dimensions.  He had just returned from _taking the benefit of the sun_, and after a cold  bath, and a slight repast, had retired to his study.\" Then follows a  description of the destruction of Pompeii, and the death of the elder  Pliny.    [Sidenote: 31. Benefit of the sun? Effect upon plants? Skin?]    31. We may judge somewhat of \"the benefits of the sun,\" by observing the  unnatural and undeveloped condition of plants and animals which are  deprived of light. Plants become blanched and tender; the fish of {51}  subterranean lakes, where no light enters, are undersized, and have no  eyes; tadpoles kept in the dark do not develop into frogs; men growing up  in mines are sallow, pale, and deformed. Besides the well-known effect of  solar light in tanning the skin, it also makes it thicker and better able  to resist exposure; though the complexion may be thereby injured, the  health gains more than compensates for the loss of beauty. \"To make good  the loss of the lily, where the sun has cast his ray, he seldom fails to  plant the rose.\"    [Sidenote: 32. Direction about clothing? Exposing limbs of children?  Clothing, night and day?]    32. CLOTHING.--In reference to clothing, we are far more apt, in our  changeful climate, to use too little than too much. An aphorism of  Boerhaave, worth remembering, if not of adopting, is, \"We should put off  our winter clothing on midsummer's day, and put it on again the day after.\"  He also says, \"Only fools and beggars suffer from the cold; the latter not  being able to get sufficient clothes, the others not having the sense to  wear them.\" The practice of exposing the limbs and necks of young children,  for the alleged purpose of \"hardening\" them, is quite hazardous. It is not  to be denied that some seem to be made tough by the process; but it is so  only with the rugged children, the delicate ones will invariably suffer  under this fanciful treatment. As has been stated before, the skin is  constantly acting, by night as well as by day. It is therefore conducive  both to cleanliness and comfort to change entirely the clothing on retiring  for the night. The day-clothing should be aired during the night, and the  bedding should be aired in the morning, for the same reason.    [Sidenote: 33. Cosmetics? Painters' colic?]    33. POISONOUS COSMETICS.--The extensive use of _cosmetics_ for the  complexion is a fertile source of disease. The majority of these  preparations contain certain poisonous mineral substances, chiefly lead.  Now, the skin rapidly absorbs the fine particles of lead, and the system  {52} experiences the same evil effects that are observed among the  operatives in lead works and painters, namely, \"painters' colic,\" and  paralysis of the hands, called \"wrist-drop.\"    34. Certain hair-dyes also contain lead, together with other noxious and  filthy ingredients. These do not work as great harm as the cosmetics, since  they are purposely kept away from the skin, but they rob the hair of its  vitality. Eye-washes, too, are made from solutions of lead, and many an eye  has been ruined by their use. They deposit a white metallic scale on the  surface of the eye, which becomes a permanent obstruction to the vision.

The term food? Source of food? Need of preparing food?]    1. THE SOURCE OF FOOD.--The term _food_ includes all those substances,  whether liquid or solid, which are necessary for the nourishment of the  body. The original source of all food is the earth, which the poet has  fitly styled the \"Mother of all living.\" In her bosom, and in the  atmosphere about her, are contained all the elements on which life depends.  But man is unable to obtain nourishment directly from such crude chemical  forms as he finds in the inorganic world. They must, with a few exceptions,  be prepared for his use, by being transformed into new and higher  combinations, more closely resembling the tissues of his own body.    [Sidenote: 2. Usefulness and hurtfulness of plants? What then must man do?  Parts of the same plant or tree?]    2. This transformation is effected, first, by the vegetable world. But all  plants are not alike useful to man; while some are absolutely hurtful.  Accordingly, he must learn to discriminate between that which is poisonous  and that which is life-supporting. Again, all parts of the same plant or  tree are not alike beneficial: in some, the fruit, in others, the leaves,  and in others, the seeds only are sufficiently refined for his use. These  he must learn to select; he must also learn the proper modes of preparing  each kind for his table, whether by cooking or other processes. {54}    [Sidenote: 3. Certain forms of vegetable creation? Example of the bee?  Cattle? The inference?]    3. Again, certain forms of the vegetable creation which are unfit, in their  crude state, for man's food, and which he rejects, are chosen as food by  some of the lower animals, and are, by them, made ready for his use. Thus  the bee takes the clover, that man cannot eat, and from it collects honey.  The cattle eat the husks of corn and the dried grass, that are by far too  coarse for man, and in their own flesh convert them into tissues closely  resembling his muscular tissue. In this way, by the aid of the transforming  processes of the vegetable and animal creations, the simple chemical  elements of the mineral kingdom are elaborated into our choice articles of  food.    [Sidenote: 4. What classification? Define organic substances. Inorganic.  Organic, how spoken of? The inorganic? Water and salt?]    4. INORGANIC SUBSTANCES.--The substances we use as food are classified as  _organic_ and _inorganic_. By organic substances are meant those derived  from living forms, such as vegetables and animals. Inorganic substances are  those simpler inanimate forms which belong to the mineral kingdom. The  former alone are commonly spoken of as food, but the latter enter very  largely into the constitution of the body, and must therefore be present in  our food. With the exception of two articles, water and common salt, these  substances only enter the system when blended with organic substances.    [Sidenote: 5. Water in physiology? Where found?
