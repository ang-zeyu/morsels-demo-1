These beautiful candies are very popular; they are pleasing both to the  eye and the palate when they are well made, but they must be kept air  tight or they will soon lose all their attractiveness and become a  sticky mass, as they have a great tendency to \"sweat.\" In order to  prevent this as much as possible it is advisable to use a little borax  in each boil. The process is simple enough, but must be worked quickly,  in fact the beauty depends upon the rapid manipulation of the sugar over  the hook; keep the eye fixed on the color; as soon as it becomes a  glossy satin with a close grain it is finished; lift it off the hook  immediately and return to the slab for casing. Do not carry on the  pulling operation until it becomes spongy, and be careful not to use too  much color; the tints should be light and delicate when finished.  Machines are made for cutting buttercups, price $6.00 and $14.00, each  machine. Crimped edge machine, $20.00 each. _Get our price list._      VANILLA BUTTERCUPS.      7 lbs. Best White Sugar.    2 lbs. Fondant Paste.    1 lb. Desiccated Cocoanut, fine.    Green color.    1 teaspoonful Cream of Tartar.    1 quart water.    Borax.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar, water and cream of tartar in the boiling pan  and boil up to crack 310 in the ordinary way; while the pan is on the  fire, take the fondant paste and work into it the desiccated cocoanut,  with a little essence of vanilla, and lay aside till required. When the  boil has reached the required degree pour the sugar on the slab, color  it light green, and when partly cool, pull over the hook until it  becomes a delicate satin tint; return it to the slab, press the boil  out, lay the fondant paste in the centre and case it all around with the  pulled sugar; now carefully work the one end of the boil down to a point  as for sticks and draw it out in lengths, required thickness: lay them  on the machine and press gently until cut through; the buttercups are  then ready for packing. It is advisable to work small boils of these  goods, as the casing being boiled soon gets brittle; keep turning the  bulk round on the plate so as to keep the fondant paste exactly in the  centre.

The hounds come to the very spot and  halt and cast about; and halt and cast in vain. Their spell is broken by  the merry stream, and the wild thing lives its life.    And this was one of the great secrets that Raggylug learned from his  mother--\"after the Brierrose, the Water is your friend.\"    One hot, muggy night in August, Molly led Rag through the woods. The  cotton-white cushion she wore under her tail twinkled ahead and was his  guiding lantern, though it went out as soon as she stopped and sat on  it. After a few runs and stops to listen, they came to the edge of the  pond. The hylas in the trees above them were singing 'sleep, sleep,'  and away out on a sunken log in the deep water, up to his chin in the  cooling bath, a bloated bullfrog was singing the praises of a 'jug o'  rum.'    \"Follow me still,\" said Molly, in rabbit, and 'flop' she went into the  pond and struck out for the sunken log in the middle. Rag flinched but  plunged with a little 'ouch,' gasping and wobbling his nose very fast  but still copying his mother. The same movements as on land sent him  through the water, and thus he found he could swim, On he went till he  reached the sunken log and scrambled up by his dripping mother on the  high dry end, with a rushy screen around them and the Water that  tells no tales. After this on warm black nights when that old fox from  Springfield came prowling through the Swamp, Rag would note the place of  the bullfrog's voice, for in case of direst need it might be a guide  to safety. And thenceforth the words of the song that the bullfrog sang  were 'Come, come, in danger come.'    This was the latest study that Rag took up with his mother--it was  really a post-graduate course, for many little rabbits never learn it at  all.    VI    No wild animal dies of old age. Its life has soon or late a tragic end.  It is only a question of how long it can hold out against its foes. But  Rag's life was proof that once a rabbit passes out of his youth he is  likely to outlive his prime and be killed only in the last third of  life, the downhill third we call old age.    The Cottontails had enemies on every side. Their daily life was a  series of escapes. For dogs, foxes, cats, skunks, coons, weasels, minks,  snakes, hawks, owls, and men, and even insects were all plotting to kill  them. They had hundreds of adventures, and at least once a day they had  to fly for their lives and save themselves by their legs and wits.    More than once that hateful fox from Springfield drove them to taking  refuge under the wreck of a barbedwire hog-pen by the spring. But once  there they could look calmly at him while he spiked his legs in vain  attempts to reach them.    Once or twice Rag when hunted had played off the hound against a skunk  that had seemed likely to be quite as dangerous as the dog.    Once he was caught alive by a hunter who had a hound and a ferret to  help him. But Rag had the luck to escape next day, with a yet deeper  distrust of ground holes. He was several times run into the water by the  cat, and many times was chased by hawks and owls, but for each kind  of danger there was a safeguard. His mother taught him the principal  dodges, and he improved on them and made many new ones as he grew older.  And the older and wiser he grew the less he trusted to his legs, and the  more to his wits for safety.    Ranger was the name of a young hound in the neighborhood. To train him  his master used to put him on the trail of one of the Cottontails. It  was nearly always Rag that they ran, for the young buck enjoyed the runs  as much as they did, the spice of danger in them being just enough for  zest. He would say:    \"Oh, mother! here comes the dog again, I must have a run to-day.\"    \"You are too bold, Raggy, my son!\" she might reply. \"I fear you will  run once too often.\"    \"But, mother, it is such glorious fun to tease that fool dog, and it's  all good training. I'll thump if I am too hard pressed, then you can  come and change off while I get my second wind.\"    On he would come, and Ranger would take the trail and follow till Rag  got tired of it. Then he either sent a thumping telegram for help, which  brought Molly to take charge of the dog, or he got rid of the dog by  some clever trick. A description of one of these shows how well Rag had  learned the arts of the woods.    He knew that his scent lay best near the ground, and was strongest when  he was warm. So if he could get off the ground, and be left in peace for  half an hour to cool off, and for the trail to stale, he knew he  would be safe. When, therefore, he tired of the chase, he made for the  Creekside brier-patch, where he 'wound'--that is, zig-zagged--till he  left a course so crooked that the dog was sure to be greatly delayed in  working it out. He then went straight to D in the woods, passing one hop  to windward of the high log E. Stopping at D, he followed his back trail  to F; here he leaped aside and ran toward G. Then, returning on his  trail to J, he waited till the hound passed on his trail at I. Rag then  got back on his old trail at H, and followed it to E, where, with a  scentbaulk or great leap aside, he reached the high log, and running to  its higher end, he sat like a bump.    Ranger lost much time in the bramble maze, and the scent was very poor  when he got it straightened out, and came to D. Here he began to circle  to pick it up, and after losing much time, struck the trail which ended  suddenly at G. Again he was at fault, and had to circle to find the  trail. Wider and wider circles, until at last, he passed right under the  log Rag was on. But a cold scent, on a cold day, does not go downward  much. Rag never budged nor winked, and the hound passed.    Again the dog came round. This time he crossed the low part of the log,  and stopped to smell it. 'Yes, clearly it was rabbity,' but it was a  stale scent now; still he mounted the log.    It was a trying moment for Rag, as the great hound came sniff-sniffing  along the log. But his nerve did not forsake him; the wind was right; he  had his mind made up to bolt as soon as Ranger came half way up. But he  didn't come. A yellow cur would have seen the rabbit sitting there, but  the hound did not, and the scent seemed stale, so he leaped off the log,  and Rag had won.    VII    Rag had never seen any other rabbit than his mother. Indeed he had  scarcely thought about there being any other. He was more and more away  from her now, and yet he never felt lonely, for rabbits do not hanker  for company. But one day in December, while he was among the red dogwood  brush, cutting a new path to the great Creekside thicket, he saw all  at once against the sky over the Sunning Bank the head and ears of a  strange rabbit. The newcomer had the air of a well-pleased discoverer  and soon came hopping Rag's way along one of his paths into his Swamp.  A new feeling rushed over him, that boiling mixture of anger and hatred  called jealousy.    The stranger stopped at one of Rag's rubbing-trees--that is, a tree  against which he used to stand on his heels and rub his chin as far up  as he could reach. He thought he did this simply because he liked it;  but all buckrabbits do so, and several ends are served. It makes the  tree rabbity, so that other rabbits know that this swamp already belongs  to a rabbit family and is not open for settlement. It also lets the next  one know by the scent if the last caller was an acquaintance, and the  height from the ground of the rubbing-places shows how tall the rabbit  is.    Now to his disgust Rag noticed that the new-comer was a head taller  than himself, and a big, stout buck at that. This was a wholly new  experience and filled Rag with a wholly new feeling. The spirit of  murder entered his heart; he chewed very hard at nothing in his mouth,  and hopping forward onto a smooth piece of hard ground he struck slowly:    'Thump--thump--thump,' which is a rabbit telegram for 'Get out of my  swamp, or fight.'    The new-comer made a big V with his ears, sat upright for a few  seconds, then, dropping on his fore-feet, sent along the ground a  louder, stronger, 'Thump--thump--thump.'    And so war was declared.    They came together by short runs side-wise, each one trying to get the  wind of the other and watching for a chance advantage. The stranger was  a big, heavy buck with plenty of muscle, but one or two trifles such as  treading on a turnover and failing to close when Rag was on low ground  showed that he had not much cunning and counted on winning his battles  by his weight. On he came at last and Rag met him like a little fury. As  they came together they leaped up and struck out with their hind feet.  Thud, thud they came, and down went poor little Rag. In a moment the  stranger was on him with his teeth and Rag was bitten, and lost several  tufts of hair before he could get up. But he was swift of foot and got  out of reach. Again he charged and again he was knocked down and bitten  severely. He was no match for his foe, and it soon became a question of  saving his own life.    Hurt as he was, he sprang away, with the stranger in full chase, and  bound to kill him as well as to oust him from the Swamp where he was  born. Rag's legs were good and so was his wind. The stranger was big and  so heavy that he soon gave up the chase, and it was well for poor Rag  that he did, for he was getting stiff from his wounds as well as tired.  From that day began a reign of terror for Rag. His training had been  against owls, dogs, weasels, men, and so on, but what to do when chased  by another rabbit, he did not know. All he knew was to lie low till he  was found, then run.    Poor little Molly was completely terrorized; she could not help Rag and  sought only to hide. But the big buck soon found her out. She tried to  run from him, but she was not now so swift as Rag. The stranger made no  attempt to kill her, but he made love to her,"]]]
