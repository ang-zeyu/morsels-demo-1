It was Samhain-tide, and the feast of Tara was being held, at which all  that was wise or skilful or well-born in Ireland were gathered together.    This is how Tara was when Tara was. There was the High King's palace  with its fortification; without it was another fortification enclosing  the four minor palaces, each of which was maintained by one of the four  provincial kings; without that again was the great banqueting hall, and  around it and enclosing all of the sacred hill in its gigantic bound ran  the main outer ramparts of Tara. From it, the centre of Ireland, four  great roads went, north, south, east, and west, and along these roads,  from the top and the bottom and the two sides of Ireland, there moved  for weeks before Samhain an endless stream of passengers.    Here a gay band went carrying rich treasure to decorate the pavilion of  a Munster lord. On another road a vat of seasoned yew, monstrous as a  house on wheels and drawn by an hundred laborious oxen, came bumping and  joggling the ale that thirsty Connaught princes would drink. On a road  again the learned men of Leinster, each with an idea in his head that  would discomfit a northern ollav and make a southern one gape and  fidget, would be marching solemnly, each by a horse that was piled high  on the back and widely at the sides with clean-peeled willow or oaken  wands, that were carved from the top to the bottom with the ogham signs;  the first lines of poems (for it was an offence against wisdom to commit  more than initial lines to writing), the names and dates of kings, the  procession of laws of Tara and of the sub-kingdoms, the names of places  and their meanings. On the brown stallion ambling peacefully yonder  there might go the warring of the gods for two or ten thousand years;  this mare with the dainty pace and the vicious eye might be sidling  under a load of oaken odes in honour of her owner's family, with a  few bundles of tales of wonder added in case they might be useful; and  perhaps the restive piebald was backing the history of Ireland into a  ditch.    On such a journey all people spoke together, for all were friends, and  no person regarded the weapon in another man's hand other than as an  implement to poke a reluctant cow with, or to pacify with loud wallops  some hoof-proud colt.    Into this teem and profusion of jolly humanity Fionn slipped, and if his  mood had been as bellicose as a wounded boar he would yet have found  no man to quarrel with, and if his eye had been as sharp as a jealous  husband's he would have found no eye to meet it with calculation or  menace or fear; for the Peace of Ireland was in being, and for six weeks  man was neighbour to man, and the nation was the guest of the High King.  Fionn went in with the notables.    His arrival had been timed for the opening day and the great feast of  welcome. He may have marvelled, looking on the bright city, with its  pillars of gleaming bronze and the roofs that were painted in many  colours, so that each house seemed to be covered by the spreading wings  of some gigantic and gorgeous bird. And the palaces themselves, mellow  with red oak, polished within and without by the wear and the care of  a thousand years, and carved with the patient skill of unending  generations of the most famous artists of the most artistic country of  the western world, would have given him much to marvel at also. It  must have seemed like a city of dream, a city to catch the heart, when,  coming over the great plain, Fionn saw Tara of the Kings held on its  hill as in a hand to gather all the gold of the falling sun, and to  restore a brightness as mellow and tender as that universal largess.    In the great banqueting hall everything was in order for the feast. The  nobles of Ireland with their winsome consorts, the learned and artistic  professions represented by the pick of their time were in place. The  Ard-Ri, Corm of the Hundred Battles, had taken his place on the raised  dais which commanded the whole of that vast hall. At his Right hand his  son Art, to be afterwards as famous as his famous father, took his seat,  and on his left Goll mor mac Morna, chief of the Fianna of Ireland, had  the seat of honour. As the High King took his place he could see every  person who was noted in the land for any reason. He would know every one  who was present, for the fame of all men is sealed at Tara, and behind  his chair a herald stood to tell anything the king might not know or had  forgotten.    Conn gave the signal and his guests seated themselves.    The time had come for the squires to take their stations behind their  masters and mistresses. But, for the moment, the great room was seated,  and the doors were held to allow a moment of respect to pass before the  servers and squires came in.    Looking over his guests, Conn observed that a young man was yet  standing.    \"There is a gentleman,\" he murmured, \"for whom no seat has been found.\"    We may be sure that the Master of the Banquet blushed at that.    \"And,\" the king continued, \"I do not seem to know the young man.\"    Nor did his herald, nor did the unfortunate Master, nor did anybody; for  the eyes of all were now turned where the king's went.    \"Give me my horn,\" said the gracious monarch.    The horn of state was put to his hand.    \"Young gentleman,\" he called to the stranger, \"I wish to drink to your  health and to welcome you to Tara.\"    The young man came forward then, greater-shouldered than any mighty  man of that gathering, longer and cleaner limbed, with his fair curls  dancing about his beardless face. The king put the great horn into his  hand.    \"Tell me your name,\" he commanded gently.    \"I am Fionn, the son of Uail, the son of Baiscne,\" said the youth.    And at that saying a touch as of lightning went through the gathering  so that each person quivered, and the son of the great, murdered captain  looked by the king's shoulder into the twinkling eye of Goll. But no  word was uttered, no movement made except the movement and the utterance  of the Ard-Ri'.    \"You are the son of a friend,\" said the great-hearted monarch. \"You  shall have the seat of a friend.\"    He placed Fionn at the right hand of his own son Art.        CHAPTER XII    It is to be known that on the night of the Feast of Samhain the doors  separating this world and the next one are opened, and the inhabitants  of either world can leave their respective spheres and appear in the  world of the other beings.    Now there was a grandson to the Dagda Mor, the Lord of the Underworld,  and he was named Aillen mac Midna, out of Shi' Finnachy, and this Aillen  bore an implacable enmity to Tara and the Ard-Ri'.    As well as being monarch of Ireland her High King was chief of the  people learned in magic, and it is possible that at some time Conn had  adventured into Tir na n-Og, the Land of the Young, and had done some  deed or misdeed in Aillen's lordship or in his family. It must have been  an ill deed in truth, for it was in a very rage of revenge that Aillen  came yearly at the permitted time to ravage Tara.    Nine times he had come on this mission of revenge, but it is not to be  supposed that he could actually destroy the holy city: the Ard-Ri'  and magicians could prevent that, but he could yet do a damage so  considerable that it was worth Conn's while to take special extra  precautions against him, including the precaution of chance.    Therefore, when the feast was over and the banquet had commenced, the  Hundred Fighter stood from his throne and looked over his assembled  people.    The Chain of Silence was shaken by the attendant whose duty and honour  was the Silver Chain, and at that delicate chime the halt went silent,  and a general wonder ensued as to what matter the High King would submit  to his people.    \"Friends and heroes,\" said Conn, \"Aillen, the son of Midna, will come  to-night from Slieve Fuaid with occult, terrible fire against our  city. Is there among you one who loves Tara and the king, and who will  undertake our defence against that being?\"    He spoke in silence, and when he had finished he listened to the same  silence, but it was now deep, ominous, agonized. Each man glanced  uneasily on his neighbour and then stared at his wine-cup or his  fingers. The hearts of young men went hot for a gallant moment and were  chilled in the succeeding one, for they had all heard of Aillen out of  Shl Finnachy in the north. The lesser gentlemen looked under their brows  at the greater champions, and these peered furtively at the greatest of  all. Art og mac Morna of the Hard Strokes fell to biting his fingers,  Cona'n the Swearer and Garra mac Morna grumbled irritably to each other  and at their neighbours, even Caelte, the son of Rona'n, looked down  into his own lap, and Goll Mor sipped at his wine without any twinkle  in his eye. A horrid embarrassment came into the great hall, and as the  High King stood in that palpitating silence his noble face changed  from kindly to grave and from that to a terrible sternness. In another  moment, to the undying shame of every person present, he would have been  compelled to lift his own challenge and declare himself the champion of  Tara for that night, but the shame that was on the faces of his people  would remain in the heart of their king. Goll's merry mind would help  him to forget, but even his heart would be wrung by a memory that he  would not dare to face. It was at that terrible moment that Fionn stood  up.    \"What,\" said he, \"will be given to the man who undertakes this defence?\"    \"All that can be rightly asked will be royally bestowed,\" was the king's  answer.    \"Who are the sureties?\" said Fionn.    \"The kings of Ireland, and Red Cith with his magicians.\"    \"I will undertake the defence,\" said Fionn.
