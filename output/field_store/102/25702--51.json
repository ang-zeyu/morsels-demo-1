Angelo in 1527, and died in 1529, after  his return to Spain.    Note 3. This painter, Gio. Francesco Penni, surnamed Il Fattore, aided  Raphael in his Roman frescoes and was much beloved by him. Together with  Giulio Romano he completed the imperfect Stanze of the Vatican.    Note 4. Cellini here alludes to the Sistine Chapel and to the Villa  Farnesina in Trastevere, built by the Sienese banker, Agostino Chigi. It  was here that Raphael painted his Galatea and the whole fable of Cupid  and Psyche.    XX    WHILE I was working at this piece, Lucagnolo, of whose ability I have  before spoken, showed considerable discontent, telling me over and over  again that I might acquire far more profit and honour by helping him to  execute large plate, as I had done at first. I made him answer that,  whenever I chose, I should always be capable of working at great silver  pieces; but that things like that on which I was now engaged were not  commissioned every day; and beside their bringing no less honour than  large silver plate, there was also more profit to be made by them. He  laughed me in the face, and said: Wait and see, Benvenuto; for by the  time that you have finished that work of yours, I will make haste to  have finished this vase, which I took in hand when you did the jewel;  and then experience shall teach you what profit I shall get from my  vase, and what you will get from your ornament. I answered that I was  very glad indeed to enter into such a competition with so good a  craftsman as he was, because the end would show which of us was  mistaken. Accordingly both the one and the other of us, with a scornful  smile upon our lips, bent our heads in grim earnest to the work, which  both were now desirous of accomplishing; so that after about ten days,  each had finished his undertaking with great delicacy and artistic skill.    Lucagnolos was a huge silver piece, used at the table of Pope Clement,  into which he flung away bits of bone and the rind of divers fruits,  while eating; an object of ostentation rather than necessity. The vase  was adorned with two fine handles, together with many masks, both small  and great, and masses of lovely foliage, in as exquisite a style of  elegance as could be imagined; on seeing which I said it was the most  beautiful vase that ever I set eyes on. Thinking he had convinced me,  Lucagnolo replied: Your work seems to me no less beautiful, but we  shall soon perceive the difference between the two. So he took his vase  and carried it to the Pope, who was very well pleased with it, and  ordered at once that he should be paid at the ordinary rate of such  large plate. Meanwhile I carried mine to Madonna Porzia, who looked at  it with astonishment, and told me I had far surpassed my promise. Then  she bade me ask for my reward whatever I liked; for it seemed to her my  desert was so great that if I craved a castle she could hardly  recompense me; but since that was not in her hands to bestow, she added  laughing that I must beg what lay within her power. I answered that the  greatest reward I could desire for my labour was to have satisfied her  ladyship. Then, smiling in my turn, and bowing to her, I took my leave,  saying I wanted no reward but that. She turned to the Roman lady and  said: You see that the qualities we discerned in him are companied by  virtues, and not vices. They both expressed their admiration, and then  Madonna Porzia continued: Friend Benvenuto, have you never heard it  said that when the poor give to the rich, the devil laughs? I replied:  Quite true! and yet, in the midst of all his troubles, I should like  this time to see him laugh; and as I took my leave, she said that this  time she had no will to bestow on him that favour.    When I came back to the shop, Lucagnolo had the money for his vase in a  paper packet; and on my arrival he cried out: Come and compare the  price of your jewel with the price of my plate. I said that he must  leave things as they were till the next day, because I hoped that even  as my work in its kind was not less excellent than his, so I should be  able to show him quite an equal price for it.    XXI    ON the day following, Madonna Porzia sent a major-domo of hers to my  shop, who called me out, and putting into my hands a paper packet full  of money from his lady, told me that she did not choose the devil should  have his whole laugh out: by which she hinted that the money sent me was  not the entire payment merited by my industry, and other messages were  added worthy of so courteous a lady. Lucagnolo, who was burning to  compare his packet with mine, burst into the shop; then in the presence  of twelve journeymen and some neighbours, eager to behold the result of  this competition, he seized his packet, scornfully exclaiming Ou! ou!  three or four times, while he poured his money on the counter with a  great noise. They were twenty-five crowns in giulios; and he fancied  that mine would be four or five crowns 'di moneta.' [1] I for my part,  stunned and stifled by his cries, and by the looks and smiles of the  bystanders, first peeped into my packet; then, after seeing that it  contained nothing but gold, I retired to one end of the counter, and,  keeping my eyes lowered and making no noise at all, I lifted it with  both hands suddenly above my head, and emptied it like a mill hopper.  [2] My coin was twice as much as his; which caused the onlookers, who  had fixed their eyes on me with some derision, to turn round suddenly to  him and say: Lucagnolo, Benvenutos pieces, being all of gold and twice  as many as yours, make a far finer effect. I thought for certain that,  what with jealousy and what with shame, Lucagnolo would have fallen dead  upon the spot; and though he took the third part of my gain, since I was  a journeyman (for such is the custom of the trade, two-thirds fall to  the workman and one-third to the masters of the shop), yet inconsiderate  envy had more power in him than avarice: it ought indeed to have worked  quite the other way, he being a peasants son from Iesi. He cursed his  art and those who taught it him, vowing that thenceforth he would never  work at large plate, but give his whole attention to those brothel  gewgaws, since they were so well paid. Equally enraged on my side, I  answered, that every bird sang its own note; that he talked after the  fashion of the hovels he came from; but that I dared swear that I should  succeed with ease in making his lubberly lumber, while he would never be  successful in my brothel gewgaws. [3] Thus I flung off in a passion,  telling him that I would soon show him that I spoke truth. The  bystanders openly declared against him, holding him for a lout, as  indeed he was, and me for a man, as I had proved myself.    Note 1. 'Scudi di giuli' and 'scudi di moneta.' The 'giulio' was a  silver coin worth 56 Italian centimes. The 'scudi di moneta' was worth  10 'giulios.' Cellini was paid in golden crowns, which had a much higher  value. The 'scuda' and the 'ducato' at this epoch were reckoned at [7]  'lire,' the 'lira' at 20 'soldi.'    Note 2. The packet was funnel-shaped, and Cellini poured the coins out  from the broad end.    Note 3. The two slang phrases translated above are 'bordellerie' and  'coglionerie.'    XXII    NEXT day, I went to thank Madonna Porzia, and told her that her ladyship  had done the opposite of what she said she would; for that while I  wanted to make the devil laugh, she had made him once more deny God. We  both laughed pleasantly at this, and she gave me other commissions for  fine and substantial work.    Meanwhile, I contrived, by means of a pupil of Raffaello da Urbino, to  get an order from the Bishop of Salamanca for one of those great  water-vessels called 'acquereccia,' which are used for ornaments to  place on sideboards. He wanted a pair made of equal size; and one of  them he entrusted to Lucagnolo, the other to me. Giovan Francesco, the  painter I have mentioned, gave us the design. [1] Accordingly I set hand  with marvellous good-will to this piece of plate, and was accommodated  with a part of his workshop by a Milanese named Maestro Giovan Piero  della Tacca. Having made my preparations, I calculated how much money I  should need for certain affairs of my own, and sent all the rest to  assist my poor father.    It so happened that just when this was being paid to him in Florence, he  stumbled upon one of those Radicals who were in the Eight at the time  when I got into that little trouble there. It was the very man who had  abused him so rudely, and who swore that I should certainly be sent into  the country with the lances. Now this fellow had some sons of very bad  morals and repute; wherefore my father said to him: Misfortunes can  happen to anybody, especially to men of choleric humour when they are in  the right, even as it happened to my son; but let the rest of his life  bear witness how virtuously I have brought him up. Would God, for your  well-being, that your sons may act neither worse nor better toward you  than mine do to me. God rendered me able to bring them up as I have  done; and where my own power could not reach, twas He who rescued them,  against your expectation, out of your violent hands. On leaving the  man, he wrote me all this story, begging me for Gods sake to practise  music at times, in order that I might not lose the fine accomplishment  which he had taught me with such trouble. The letter so overflowed with  expressions of the tenderest fatherly affection, that I was moved to  tears of filial piety, resolving, before he died, to gratify him amply  with regard to music. Thus God grants us those lawful blessings which we  ask in prayer, nothing doubting.    Note 1. That is, Il Fattore. See above, p. 34.

Athenians visiting the Macedonian capital would hear, and  from time to time actually see, something of a religious custom, in  which the habit of an earlier world might seem to survive.  As they  saw the lights flitting over the mountains, [58] and heard the wild,  sharp cries of the women, there was presented, as a singular fact in  the more prosaic actual life of a later time, an enthusiasm otherwise  relegated to the wonderland of a distant past, in which a supposed  primitive harmony and understanding between man and nature renewed  itself.  Later sisters of Centaur and Amazon, the Maenads, as they  beat the earth in strange sympathy with its waking up from sleep, or  as, in the description of the Messenger, in the play of Euripides,  they lie sleeping in the glen, revealed among the morning mists, were  themselves indeed as remnants--flecks left here and there and not yet  quite evaporated under the hard light of a later and commoner day--of  a certain cloud-world which had once covered all things with a veil  of mystery.  Whether or not, in what was often probably coarse as  well as extravagant, there may have lurked some finer vein of ethical  symbolism, such as Euripides hints at--the soberer influence, in the  Thiasus, of keen air and animal expansion, certainly, for art, and a  poetry delighting in colour and form, it was a custom rich in  suggestion.  The imitative arts would draw from it altogether new  motives of freedom and energy, of freshness in old forms.  It is from  this fantastic scene that the beautiful wind-touched draperies, the  rhythm, the heads suddenly thrown back, of many a Pompeian wall-  painting and sarcophagus-frieze are originally derived; and that  melting languor, that perfectly [59] composed lassitude of the fallen  Maenad, became a fixed type in the school of grace, the school of  Praxiteles.    The circumstances of the place thus combining with his peculiar  motive, Euripides writes the Bacchanals.  It is this extravagant  phase of religion, and the latest-born of the gods, which as an  amende honorable to the once slighted traditions of Greek belief, he  undertakes to interpret to an audience composed of people who, like  Scyles, the Hellenising king of Scythia, feel the attraction of Greek  religion and Greek usage, but on their quainter side, and partly  relish that extravagance.  Subject and audience alike stimulate the  romantic temper, and the tragedy of the Bacchanals, with its  innovations in metre and diction, expressly noted as foreign or  barbarous--all the charm and grace of the clear-pitched singing of  the chorus, notwithstanding--with its subtleties and sophistications,  its grotesques, mingled with and heightening a real shudder at the  horror of the theme, and a peculiarly fine and human pathos, is  almost wholly without the reassuring calm, generally characteristic  of the endings of Greek tragedy: is itself excited, troubled,  disturbing--a spotted or dappled thing, like the oddly dappled fawn-  skins of its own masquerade, so aptly expressive of the shifty,  twofold, rapidly-doubling genius of the divine, wild creature  himself.  Let us listen and watch the strange masks coming and going,  for a while, [60] as far as may be as we should do with a modern  play.  What are its charms?  What is still alive, impressive, and  really poetical for us, in the dim old Greek play?    The scene is laid at Thebes, where the memory of Semele, the mother  of Dionysus, is still under a cloud.  Her own sisters, sinning  against natural affection, pitiless over her pathetic death and  finding in it only a judgment upon the impiety with which, having  shamed herself with some mortal lover, she had thrown the blame of  her sin upon Zeus, have, so far, triumphed over her.  The true and  glorious version of her story lives only in the subdued memory of the  two aged men, Teiresias the prophet, and her father Cadmus, apt now  to let things go loosely by, who has delegated his royal power to  Pentheus, the son of one of those sisters--a hot-headed and impious  youth.  So things had passed at Thebes; and now a strange  circumstance has happened.  An odd sickness has fallen upon the  women: Dionysus has sent the sting of his enthusiasm upon them, and  has pushed it to a sort of madness, a madness which imitates the true  Thiasus.  Forced to have the form without the profit of his worship,  the whole female population, leaving distaff and spindle, and headed  by the three princesses, have deserted the town, and are lying  encamped on the bare rocks, or under the pines, among the solitudes  of Cithaeron.  And it is just at this point that the divine child,  [61] supposed to have perished at his mother's side in the flames,  returns to his birthplace, grown to manhood.    Dionysus himself speaks the prologue.  He is on a journey through the  world to found a new religion; and the first motive of this new  religion is the vindication of the memory of his mother.  In  explaining this design, Euripides, who seeks always for pathetic  effect, tells in few words, touching because simple, the story of  Semele--here, and again still more intensely in the chorus which  follows--the merely human sentiment of maternity being not forgotten,  even amid the thought of the divine embraces of her fiery bed-fellow.  It is out of tenderness for her that the son's divinity is to be  revealed.  A yearning affection, the affection with which we see him  lifting up his arms about her, satisfied at last, on an old Etruscan  metal mirror, has led him from place to place: everywhere he has had  his dances and established his worship; and everywhere his presence  has been her justification.  First of all the towns in Greece he  comes to Thebes, the scene of her sorrows: he is standing beside the  sacred waters of Dirce and Ismenus: the holy place is in sight: he  hears the Greek speech, and sees at last the ruins of the place of  her lying-in, at once his own birth-chamber and his mother's tomb.  His image, as it detaches itself little by little from the episodes  of the play, and is further characterised by the [62] songs of the  chorus, has a singular completeness of symbolical effect.  The  incidents of a fully developed human personality are superinduced on  the mystical and abstract essence of that fiery spirit in the flowing  veins of the earth--the aroma of the green world is retained in the  fair human body, set forth in all sorts of finer ethical lights and  shades--with a wonderful kind of subtlety.  In the course of his long  progress from land to land, the gold, the flowers, the incense of the  East, have attached themselves deeply to him: their effect and  expression rest now upon his flesh like the gleaming of that old  ambrosial ointment of which Homer speaks as resting ever on the  persons of the gods, and cling to his clothing--the mitre binding his  perfumed yellow hair--the long tunic down to the white feet, somewhat  womanly, and the fawn-skin, with its rich spots, wrapped about the  shoulders.  As the door opens to admit him, the scented air of the  vineyards (for the vine-blossom has an exquisite perfume) blows  through; while the convolvulus on his mystic rod represents all  wreathing flowery things whatever, with or without fruit, as in  America all such plants are still called vines.  \"Sweet upon the  mountains,\" the excitement of which he loves so deeply and to which  he constantly invites his followers--\"sweet upon the mountains,\" and  profoundly amorous, his presence embodies all the voluptuous  abundance of Asia, its beating [63] sun, its \"fair-towered cities,  full of inhabitants,\" which the chorus describe in their luscious  vocabulary, with the rich Eastern names--Lydia, Persia, Arabia Felix:  he is a sorcerer or an enchanter, the tyrant Pentheus thinks: the  springs of water, the flowing of honey and milk and wine, are his  miracles, wrought in person.    We shall see presently how, writing for that northern audience,  Euripides crosses the Theban with the gloomier Thracian legend, and  lets the darker stain show through.  Yet, from the first, amid all  this floweriness, a touch or trace of that gloom is discernible.  The  fawn-skin, composed now so daintily over the shoulders, may be worn  with the whole coat of the animal made up, the hoofs gilded and tied  together over the right shoulder, to leave the right arm disengaged  to strike, its head clothing the human head within, as Alexander, on  some of his coins, looks out from the elephant's scalp, and Hercules  out of the jaws of a lion, on the coins of Camarina.  Those  diminutive golden horns attached to the forehead, represent not  fecundity merely, nor merely the crisp tossing of the waves of  streams, but horns of offence.  And our fingers must beware of the  thyrsus, tossed about so wantonly by himself and his chorus.  The  pine-cone at its top does but cover a spear-point; and the thing is a  weapon--the sharp spear of the hunter Zagreus--though hidden now by  the fresh leaves, and that button of pine-cone (useful also to dip in  [64] wine, to check the sweetness) which he has plucked down, coming  through the forest, at peace for a while this spring morning.    And the chorus emphasise this character, their songs weaving for the  whole piece, in words more effective than any painted scenery, a  certain congruous background which heightens all; the intimate sense  of mountains and mountain things being in"]]]
