That  did not lessen my annoyance; and Regis Hastur's interference, and the  foolish grin on the girl's face, made me boil over.    I wanted to question her further about the sight of trailmen on the  bridge, but decided against it. We had been spared attack on the rapids,  so it wasn't impossible that a group, not hostile, was simply watching  our progress--maybe even aware that we were on a peaceful mission.    But I didn't believe it for a minute. If I knew anything about the  trailmen, it was this--one could not judge them by human standards at  all. I tried to decide what I would have done, as a trailman, but my  brain wouldn't run that way at the moment.    The Darkovan brothers had built up the fire with a thoroughly reckless  disregard of watching eyes. It seemed to me that the morale and fitness  of the shivering crew was of more value at the moment than caution; and  around the roaring fire, feeling my soaked clothes warming to the blaze  and drinking boiling hot tea from a mug, it seemed that we were right.  Optimism reappeared; Kyla, letting Hjalmar dress her hands which had  been rubbed raw by the slipping lianas, made jokes with the men about  her feat of acrobatics.    We had made camp on the summit of an outlying arm of the main ridge of  the Hellers, and the whole massive range lay before our eyes, turned to  a million colors in the declining sun. Green and turquoise and rose, the  mountains were even more beautiful than I remembered. The shoulder of  the high slope we had just climbed had obscured the real mountain massif  from our sight, and I saw Kendricks' eyes widen as he realized that this  high summit we had just mastered was only the first step of the task  which lay before us. The real ridge rose ahead, thickly forested on the  lower slopes, then strewn with rock and granite like the landscape of an  airless, deserted moon. And above the rock, there were straight walls  capped with blinding snow and ice. Down one peak a glacier flowed, a  waterfall, a cascade shockingly arrested in motion. I murmured the  trailman's name for the mountain, aloud, and translated it for the  others:    \"The Wall Around the World.\"    \"Good name for it,\" Lerrys murmured, coming with his mug in his hand to  look at the mountain. \"Jason, the big peak there has never been climbed,  has it?\"    \"I can't remember.\" My teeth were chattering and I went back toward the  fire. Regis surveyed the distant glacier and murmured, \"It doesn't look  too bad. There could be a route along that western _arete_--Hjalmar,  weren't you with the expedition that climbed and mapped High Kimbi?\"    The giant nodded, rather proudly. \"We got within a hundred feet of the  top, then a snowstorm came up and we had to turn back. Some day we'll  tackle the Wall Around the World--it's been tried, but no one ever  climbed the peak.\"    \"No one ever will,\" Lerrys stated positively, \"There's two hundred feet  of sheer rock cliff, Prince Regis, you'd need wings to get up. And  there's the avalanche ledge they call Hell's Alley--\"    Kendricks broke in irritably, \"I don't care whether it's ever been  climbed or ever will be climbed, we're not going to climb it now!\" He  stared at me and added, \"I hope!\"    \"We're not.\" I was glad of the interruption. If the youngsters and  amateurs wanted to amuse themselves plotting hypothetical attacks on  unclimbable sierras, that was all very well, but it was, if nothing  worse, a great waste of time. I showed Kendricks a notch in the ridge,  thousands of feet lower than the peaks, and well-sheltered from the  icefalls on either side.    \"That's Dammerung; we're going through there. We won't be on the  mountain at all, and it's less than 22,000 feet high in the  pass--although there are some bad ledges and washes. We'll keep clear of  the main tree-roads if we can, and all the mapped trailmen's villages,  but we may run into wandering bands--\" abruptly I made my decision and  gestured them around me.    \"From this point,\" I broke the news, \"we're liable to be attacked. Kyla,  tell them what you saw.\"           *       *       *       *       *    She put down her mug. Her face was serious again, as she related what  she had seen on the bridge. \"We're on a peaceful mission, but they don't  know that yet. The thing to remember is that they do not wish to kill,  only to wound and rob. If we show fight--\" she displayed a short ugly  knife, which she tucked matter-of-factly into her shirt-front, \"they  will run away again.\"    Lerrys loosened a narrow dagger which until this moment I had thought  purely ornamental. He said, \"Mind if I say something more, Jason? I  remember from the 'Narr campaign--the trailmen fight at close quarters,  and by human standards they fight dirty.\" He looked around fiercely, his  unshaven face glinting as he grinned. \"One more thing. I like elbow  room. Do we have to stay roped together when we start out again?\"    I thought it over. His enthusiasm for a fight made me feel both annoyed  and curiously delighted. \"I won't make anyone stay roped who thinks he'd  be safer without it,\" I said, \"we'll decide that when the time comes,  anyway. But personally--the trailmen are used to running along narrow  ledges, and we're not. Their first tactic would probably be to push us  off, one by one. If we're roped, we can fend them off better.\" I  dismissed the subject, adding, \"Just now, the important thing is to dry  out.\"    Kendricks remained at my side after the others had gathered around the  fire, looking into the thick forest which sloped up to our campsite. He  said, \"This place looks as if it had been used for a camp before. Aren't  we just as vulnerable to attack here as we would be anywhere else?\"    He had hit on the one thing I hadn't wanted to talk about. This clearing  was altogether too convenient. I only said, \"At least there aren't so  many ledges to push us off.\"    Kendricks muttered, \"You've got the only blaster!\"    \"I left it at Carthon,\" I said truthfully. Then I laid down the law:    \"Listen, Buck. If we kill a single trailman, except in hand-to-hand  fight in self-defense, we might as well pack up and go home. We're on a  peaceful mission, and we're begging a favor. Even if we're attacked--we  kill only as a last resort, and in hand-to-hand combat!\"    \"Damned primitive frontier planet--\"    \"Would you rather die of the trailmen's disease?\"    He said savagely, \"We're apt to catch it anyway--here. You're immune,  you don't care, you're safe! The rest of us are on a suicide  mission--and damn it, when I die I want to take a few of those monkeys  with me!\"           *       *       *       *       *    I bent my head, bit my lip and said nothing. Buck couldn't be blamed for  the way he felt. After a moment I pointed to the notch in the ridge  again. \"It's not so far. Once we get through Dammerung, it's easy going  into the trailmen's city. Beyond there, it's all civilized.\"    \"Maybe _you_ call it civilization,\" Kendricks said, and turned away.    \"Come on, let's finish drying our feet.\"    And at that moment they hit us.           *       *       *       *       *    Kendricks' yell was the only warning I had before I was fighting away  something scrabbling up my back. I whirled and ripped the creature away,  and saw dimly that the clearing was filled to the rim with an explosion  of furry white bodies. I cupped my hands and yelled, in the only  trailman dialect I knew, \"Hold off! We come in peace!\"    One of them yelled something unintelligible and plunged at me--another  tribe! I saw a white-furred, chinless face, contorted in rage, a small  ugly knife--a female! I ripped out my own knife, fending away a savage  slash. Something tore white-hot across the knuckles of my hand; the  fingers went limp and my knife fell, and the trailman woman snatched it  up and made off with her prize, swinging lithely upward into the  treetops.    I searched quickly, gripped with my good hand at the bleeding knuckles,  and found Regis Hastur struggling at the edge of a ledge with a pair of  the creatures. The crazy thought ran through my mind that if they killed  him all Darkover would rise and exterminate the trailmen and it would  all be my fault. Then Regis tore one hand free, and made a curious  motion with his fingers.    It looked like an immense green spark a foot long, or like a fireball.  It exploded in one creature's white face and she gave a wild howl of  terror and anguish, scrabbled blindly at her eyes, and with a despairing  shriek, ran for the shelter of the trees. The pack of trailmen gave a  long formless wail, and then they were gathering, flying, retreating  into the shadows. Rafe yelled something obscene and then a bolt of  bluish flame lanced toward the retreating pack. One of the humanoids  fell without a cry, pitching senseless over the ledge.    I ran toward Rafe, struggling with him for the shocker he had drawn from  its hiding-place inside his shirt. \"You blind damned fool!\" I cursed  him, \"you may have ruined everything--\"    \"They'd have killed him without it,\" he retorted wrathfully. He had  evidently failed to see how efficiently Regis defended himself. Rafe  motioned toward the fleeing pack and sneered, \"Why don't you go with  your friends?\"    With a grip I thought I had forgotten, I got my hand around Rafe's  knuckles and squeezed. His hand went limp and I snatched the shocker and  pitched it over the ledge.    \"One word and I'll pitch you after it,\" I warned. \"Who's hurt?\"    Garin was blinking senselessly, half-dazed by a blow; Regis' forehead  had been gashed and dripped blood, and Hjalmar's thigh sliced in a clean  cut. My own knuckles were laid bare and the hand was getting numb. It  was a little while before anybody noticed Kyla, crouched over speechless  with pain.

The woods and groves  are searched through and through, and no doubt the privacy of many a  squirrel and many a wood mouse is intruded upon. What cozy nooks and  retreats they do spy out, so much more attractive than the painted hive  in the garden, so much cooler in summer and so much warmer in winter!    The bee is in the main an honest citizen; she prefers legitimate to  illegitimate business; she is never an outlaw until her proper sources  of supply fail; she will not touch honey as long as honey-yielding  flowers can be found; she always prefers to go to the fountain-head, and  dislikes to take her sweets at second hand. But in the fall, after the  flowers have failed, she can be tempted. The bee-hunter takes advantage  of this fact; he betrays her with a little honey. He wants to steal her  stores, and he first encourages her to steal his, then follows the thief  home with her booty. This is the whole trick of the bee-hunter. The bees  never suspect his game, else by taking a circuitous route they could  easily baffle him. But the honey-bee has absolutely no wit or cunning  outside of her special gifts as a gatherer and storer of honey. She is a  simple-minded creature, and can be imposed upon by any novice. Yet it is  not every novice that can find a bee-tree. The sportsman may track his  game to its retreat by the aid of his dog, but in hunting the honey-bee  one must be his own dog, and track his game through an element in which  it leaves no trail. It is a task for a sharp, quick eye, and may test  the resources of the best wood-craft. One autumn when I devoted much  time to this pursuit, as the best means of getting at nature and the  open-air exhilaration, my eye became so trained that bees were nearly  as easy to it as birds. I saw and heard bees wherever I went. One day,  standing on a street corner in a great city, I saw above the trucks  and the traffic a line of bees carrying off sweets from some grocery or  confectionery shop.    One looks upon the woods with a new interest when he suspects they hold  a colony of bees. What a pleasing secret it is; a tree with a heart  of comb-honey, a decayed oak or maple with a bit of Sicily or Mount  Hymettus stowed away in its trunk or branches; secret chambers where  lies hidden the wealth of ten thousand little freebooters, great nuggets  and wedges of precious ore gathered with risk and labor from every field  and wood about.    But if you would know the delights of bee-hunting, and how many sweets  such a trip yields beside honey, come with me some bright, warm, late  September or early October day. It is the golden season of the year,  and any errand or pursuit that takes us abroad upon the hills or by  the painted woods and along the amber colored streams at such a time is  enough. So, with haversacks filled with grapes and peaches and apples  and a bottle of milk,--for we shall not be home to dinner,--and armed  with a compass, a hatchet, a pail, and a box with a piece of comb-honey  neatly fitted into it--any box the size of your hand with a lid will do  nearly as well as the elaborate and ingenious contrivance of the regular  bee-hunter--we sally forth. Our course at first lies along the highway,  under great chestnut-trees whose nuts are just dropping, then through an  orchard and across a little creek, thence gently rising through a long  series of cultivated fields toward some high, uplying land, behind which  rises a rugged wooded ridge or mountain, the most sightly point in all  this section. Behind this ridge for several miles the country is wild,  wooded, and rocky, and is no doubt the home of many wild swarms of  bees. What a gleeful uproar the robins, cedar-birds, high-holes, and  cow black-birds make amid the black cherry-trees as we pass along. The  raccoons, too, have been here after black cherries, and we see their  marks at various points. Several crows are walking about a newly  sowed wheat field we pass through, and we pause to note their graceful  movements and glossy coats. I have seen no bird walk the ground with  just the same air the crow does. It is not exactly pride; there is no  strut or swagger in it, though perhaps just a little condescension; it  is the contented, complaisant, and self-possessed gait of a lord over  his domains. All these acres are mine, he says, and all these crops; men  plow and sow for me, and I stay here or go there, and find life sweet  and good wherever I am. The hawk looks awkward and out of place on the  ground; the game birds hurry and skulk, but the crow is at home and  treads the earth as if there were none to molest him or make him afraid.    The crows we have always with us, but it is not every day or every  season that one sees an eagle. Hence I must preserve the memory of one I  saw the last day I went bee-hunting. As I was laboring up the side of a  mountain at the head of a valley, the noble bird sprang from the top of  a dry tree above me and came sailing directly over my head. I saw him  bend his eye down upon me, and I could hear the low hum of his plumage,  as if the web off every quill in his great wings vibrated in his strong,  level flight. I watched him as long as my eye could hold him. When he  was fairly clear of the mountain he began that sweeping spiral movement  in which he climbs the sky. Up and up he went without once breaking his  majestic poise till he appeared to sight some far-off alien geography,  when he bent his course thitherward and gradually vanished in the blue  depths. The eagle is a bird of large ideas, he embraces long distances;  the continent is his home. I never look upon one without emotion; I  follow him with my eye as long as I can. I think of Canada, of the Great  Lakes, of the Rocky Mountains, of the wild and sounding sea-coast. The  waters are his, and the woods and the inaccessible cliffs. He pierces  behind the veil of the storm, and his joy is height and depth and vast  spaces.    We go out of our way to touch at a spring run in the edge of the woods,  and are lucky to find a single scarlet lobelia lingering there. It seems  almost to light up the gloom with its intense bit of color. Beside  a ditch in a field beyond we find the great blue lobelia (Lobelia  syphilitica), and near it amid the weeds and wild grasses and purple  asters the most beautiful of our fall flowers, the fringed gentian. What  a rare and delicate, almost aristocratic look the gentian has amid its  coarse, unkempt surroundings. It does not lure the bee, but it lures and  holds every passing human eye. If we strike through the corner of yonder  woods, where the ground is moistened by hidden springs and where there  is a little opening amid the trees, we shall find the closed gentian, a  rare flower in this locality. I had walked this way many times before  I chanced upon its retreat; and then I was following a line of bees. I  lost the bees but I got the gentians. How curiously this flower looks,  with its deep blue petals folded together so tightly--a bud and yet a  blossom. It is the nun among our wild flowers, a form closely veiled  and cloaked. The buccaneer bumble-bee sometimes tries to rifle it of  its sweets. I have seen the blossom with the bee entombed in it. He  had forced his way into the virgin corolla as if determined to know its  secret, but he had never returned with the knowledge he had gained.    After a refreshing walk of a couple of miles we reach a point where we  will make our first trial--a high stone wall that runs parallel with the  wooded ridge referred to, and separated from it by a broad field. There  are bees at work there on that goldenrod, and it requires but little  maneuvering to sweep one into our box. Almost any other creature rudely  and suddenly arrested in its career and clapped into a cage in this way  would show great confusion and alarm. The bee is alarmed for a moment,  but the bee has a passion stronger than its love of life or fear of  death, namely, desire for honey, not simply to eat, but to carry home  as booty. \"Such rage of honey in their bosom beats,\" says Virgil. It is  quick to catch the scent of honey in the box, and as quick to fall to  filling itself. We now set the box down upon the wall and gently remove  the cover. The bee is head and shoulders in one of the half-filled  cells, and is oblivious to everything else about it. Come rack, come  ruin, it will die at work. We step back a few paces, and sit down upon  the ground so as to bring the box against the blue sky as a background.  In two or three minutes the bee is seen rising slowly and heavily from  the box. It seems loath to leave so much honey behind and it marks the  place well. It mounts aloft in a rapidly increasing spiral, surveying  the near and minute objects first, then the larger and more distant,  till having circled about the spot five or six times and taken all its  bearings it darts away for home. It is a good eye that holds fast to the  bee till it is fairly off. Sometimes one's head will swim following it,  and often one's eyes are put out by the sun. This bee gradually drifts  down the hill, then strikes away toward a farm-house half a mile away,  where I know bees are kept. Then we try another and another, and the  third bee, much to our satisfaction, goes straight toward the woods. We  could see the brown speck against the darker background for many yards.  The regular bee-hunter professes to be able to tell a wild bee from a  tame one by the color, the former, he says, being lighter. But there is  no difference; they are both alike in color and in manner. Young bees  are lighter than old, and that is all there is of it. If a bee  lived many years in the woods it would doubtless come to have some  distinguishing marks, but the life of a bee is only a few months at the  farthest, and no change is wrought in this brief time.    Our bees are all soon back, and more with them, for"]]]
