If he had lived and done  nothin', then he would be a 'tirely different person to dis very day, I  knows dat.    \"Does I 'member President Lincoln? I sho' does, but not so much, 'cause  I was too young to have much sense. I has heard my mammy and daddy say  he was a good man and wanted everybody to be free, both white and black.  Dere was a heap of poor white folks in slavery time, and some of them  lived mighty hard, worse than the slaves sometimes. You knows blood is  thick and it is gwine to turn to its kind befo' helpin' de others. They  say slavery was wrong but what 'bout hard times? Dat is de worse kind of  slavery, I thinks. All dis hollerin' 'round 'bout freedom they has,  shucks, all dat kind of talk ain't nothin'. When you has work and some  money in your pocket so you can go to de store and buy some meat and  bread, then you has de best freedom there is, don't tell me.    \"President Roosevelt is 'nother good man. He has looked down on de poor  and 'tressed in dis land wid mercy; has give work and food to de poor  people when nobody else would. He sho' has turnt dis country 'round and  tried so hard to make things right wid de people. When he turn dis way  and turn dat way, them men up there where he is, try to stop him from  helpin' us, but de Blessed Master is gwine to hold his hands up. They  ain't gwine to be able to stop him, 'cause he has done so much good in  de world. Dat man is gwine to be 'membered by de people always, but them  dat has fought him and worked against him is sho' gwine to be forgot.  Nobody wants to 'member them for de evil they has done. You knows dat if  you sows evil you is sho' gwine to gather evil in time. They ain't gwine  sow much longer; their harvest time is right out dere in sight, but de  President is gwine to live on wid us.    \"I's gettin' old now, I has to draw on de 'membrance of de past, tottle  'long in de present and stare wid dese old eyes out dere into what is to  come (future). I has rheumatism and high blood pressure, so you see I's  in for a troublesome time from now on to dat last day. I's livin' wid my  niece now, in her own home, dat is some pleasure to me in my old age.\"          Jimmie Johnson          *Interview with \"Uncle\" Jimmie Johnson (90)*      *172 E. Park Ave., Spartanburg, S.C.*      --_F.S. DuPre, Spartanburg, S.C._    \"I was born in Virginia, but Dr. L.C. Kennedy bought me, my mother and  brothers and we moved to Spartanburg. My father stayed in Virginia. Dr.  Kennedy lived near where North Church Street and Kennedy Place now is,  and I lived in a two-room house in his back yard. I was just a baby at  the time. My old masser was as good and kind to me as he could be, so  was my missus. My mother died when I was ten years old, and Missus was  just like a mother to me all the time. When I got old enough I used to  do some things around the yard for Masser and Missus.    \"Masser was an Episcopalian, and I went to Sunday School where the rock  church now stands (Church of the Advent). Miss Mary Legg was my teacher,  and she was a saintly woman. She was a niece of old Masser. Old Missus  used to come to the house where I lived and teach me my alphabet. After  I got older, I used to take care of Masser's horse and buggy for him;  used to hitch-up the horse for him and go with him on his ways to see a  patient. Bless his heart, he let me take my Webster's blue back speller  and my history with me when I would drive with him. I would study those  books and Masser would tell me how to pronounce the hard words. That is  the way I got my education. Masser would tell Missus that Jimmie was a  smart boy, that he had no father nor mother and that they must be good  to him. They sure was. I never wanted for a thing. Sometimes on our  drives Masser would tell me some Latin words, but I never did study  Latin--just English.    \"My masser would say that Jimmie had sense, was a good boy, so Missus  would let me practice on her organ or her piano in the house. I got  pretty good on these, so when I got to be a young man, I taught lessons  on both the reed organ and the melodian, then on the piano. I taught the  rudiments of music and piano for about 25 years.    \"When the Yankee soldiers come to Spartanburg it scared me. They kept  telling me that they were not going to hurt me, but I got a pile of  brick-bats and put them under the house. I told Missus I wasn't going to  let any of the soldiers hurt her. The Yankee soldiers did not bother me.  They came all around our house, but every one of them was quiet and  orderly. They took some of Missus' sugar and hams, but did not kill any  of the chickens. I told them not to take the sugar, but they took it and  the hams anyhow.    \"Missus told me that I was free, but I told her I was going to stay on  where I was and protect her until I died. And when Masser died, I  grieved and grieved about him. I loved him dearly and I know he loved  me. He was good and kind to me always. He never whipped me, not once. I  grieve about my masser to this day. He was a kind gentleman.    \"No, I never married, and I haven't got anybody kin to me now. My  brothers all died and I am the only one left. I adopted four children. I  taught them music and we got on pretty well after Missus died. I stayed  with her until she died. I told Masser I was going to stay with them  even if I was free, and I did. When Masser died, I had no one to love  but Missus. I taught music and gave piano lessons, but I can't do that  now, as I am too old. Lately I tried to cut some wood. I would cut a  lick, then rest; cut a lick, then rest, so I gave it up.    \"Lord bless your soul! I am so glad you told who you are, and you talk  like Masser Dan. You know he and I used to play together as boys. He  would give me anything he had. Honey, come around and see me again. I is  sure glad to see you. What did you say your name was?\" Upon being told,  his face would light up with a smile, and he would repeat just what he  had said before. He was then asked when he got to be a poet. \"Law'  chile, my old missus told me I was going to be a poet.\"    This ninety-year-old ex-slave then sat down at the piano and played for  the writer.          Mary Johnson          *I*      *Interview with Mary Johnson (85)*      *Newberry, S.C.*      --_G.L. Summer, Newberry, S.C._    \"I was born seven miles from Newberry, near Jalapa. I was a slave of  John Johnson and his wife, Polly (Dorroh) Johnson. They was good to dere  slaves. My daddy was Daniel and my mudder Elisa Johnson who was slaves  of marster John Johnson. My mudder come from Georgia when she was 14  years old, bought by Marse Johnson. We lived in a little one-room house  in dere yard. The mistress learned me to card and spin, and to weave  when I was a child. When I was old enough, dey put me in de field to  work, hoe and pick cotton. We got no money for working, but got our  place to live, some victuals and a few clothes to wear. We had no  garden, but helped de mistress in her garden and she give us something  to eat from it. We had homespun dresses; we made not much underclothes,  but sometimes in awful cold weather, we had red flannel underskirts.    \"Nigger boys in slavery when dere work was done in evening, sometime  went hunting and caught rabbits, squirrels or 'possums.    \"We got up at sun-up in mornings and worked 'till sun-down. We had  Saturday afternoon off to do anything we wanted to do. At Christmas  time, we got dat day off, and de master would have a big dinner wid all  kinds good things to eat, spread out in de yard.    \"We never did learn to read and write--had no nigger school and had no  nigger church, but sometimes de white folks would have us go to dere  church and set in back seat or gallery.    \"The white folks had cotton pickings and corn shuckings often and we  helped. Dey had good dinners for them coming to it. De childrens, white  and black played marbles sometimes, and played base. Us slave children  played base and jumped from one base to another before could be caught;  and we sing: 'Can I git to Molly's bright? Three course and ten. Can I  get there by candle-light? yes, if your legs are long and light.'    \"Marse John's youngest son got to be a doctor. He was a good man and  helped us when we was sick. He did not gibe herbs much, but some of de  ole folks used 'life everlasting', now called rabbit tobacco, for cure  of bad colds or pneumonia. Dey boiled it and make a plaster and put it  on sore places of chest. Dey used holly bush or spice bush bark, boiled  to a tea and drunk for sickness.    \"De padderrollers come in dat section, they rode at night and if caught,  a nigger, when he was out of his place, would be took in and told dat he  would get 25 lashes if he was caught again. When de war was over, de  Yankees went through but didn't bother us; but dey stold horses, mules,  cows and supplies. When freedom come, we left the place, 'cause marse  Johnson and some his folks went to Mississippi. We hired out to Kirk  Richards nearby.    \"De Ku Klux was not a bother. Dey jus marched sometimes at night, wid  long white sheets over dem and all over de horses. Dere heads were  covered with small holes for eyes, nose and mouth, and had long white  ears like a horses ears.    \"I think Abe Lincoln was a fine man, and Jeff Davis was good too. Slaver  did good to nigger, made him careful and know how to work.\"        *II*      *Interview with Mary Johnson (85)*      *Newberry, S.C.*      --_G.L.

To quantify the magnitude of this difference,  we compared the measured value for _Procyon lotor_ with one calculated  for it from a mass-specific least-squares regression equation (Eq. 6;  R squared = 0.78) derived from data for those procyonids with lower than  predicted [.H]_{b}: _Potos flavus_, _Procyon cancrivorus_,  _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, and _Bassariscus astutus_ (Table 7).

Although this does appear to be the case for  diet specialists, the analysis is not so clear-cut for omnivorous  species (McNab, 1986a). His analysis also indicates that an animal's  \"behavior\" (i.e., whether it is terrestrial, arboreal, subterranean,  aquatic, etc.), secondarily modifies the influence of food habits on  [.H]_{b}. For example, terrestrial frugivores have [.H]_{b}'s that are  very near predicted values, whereas arboreal frugivores have rates  that are much lower than predicted (McNab, 1986a).

All six species  clearly have mixed diets. Compared to other species, _Procyon lotor_  is highly catholic in its diet, taking food from almost twice as  many categories as _Nasua narica_, three times as many as _Procyon  cancrivorus_, _Nasua nasua_, and _Bassariscus astutus_, and nine times  as many as _Potos flavus_.    For those species for which food habit data are quantified, we used  Eisenberg's (1981:247-251) substrate/feeding matrix method, where  \"substrate\" is analogous to McNab's (1986a) \"behavior,\" to construct  the following feeding categories that are based on the major food  groups utilized by each species (Table 9).      1. _Potos flavus:_ (1) arboreal/frugivore, insectivore.      2. _Procyon cancrivorus:_ (1) semiaquatic/crustacivore,       molluscivore, insectivore, piscivore, carnivore.      3. _Nasua nasua:_ (1) terrestrial/insectivore, arachnidivore,       carnivore, frugivore.      4. _Bassariscus astutus:_ (1) terrestrial/carnivore, insectivore,       frugivore.      5. _Procyon lotor:_ (1) terrestrial/carnivore, granivore,       frugivore, insectivore; and (2) semiaquatic/crustacivore,       molluscivore, insectivore, piscivore, carnivore.    FOOD HABITS AND BASAL METABOLISM.--The most important foods in the  diet of _Procyon lotor_ are vertebrates, nuts, seeds, and fruits  (Table 9). These are the same foods that are eaten by those dietary  specialists that have [.H]_{b}'s equivalent to, or higher than, values  predicted for them by the Kleiber equation (McNab, 1986a). The most  important foods in the diets of _Potos flavus_, _Procyon cancrivorus_,  and _Nasua nasua_ are invertebrates and fruit (Table 9), and these  foods are eaten by dietary specialists that have lower than predicted  [.H]_{b}'s (McNab, 1986a). Major foods in the diet of _Bassariscus  astutus_ are terrestrial vertebrates, insects, and fruit (Table 9).  Dietary specialists that eat terrestrial vertebrates have higher than  predicted [.H]_{b}'s, whereas those that feed on insects have [.H]_{b}'s  that are lower than predicted (McNab, 1986a). Year-round utilization of  vertebrates by _Bassariscus astutus_ suggests that it also should"]]]
