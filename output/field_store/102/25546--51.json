We can furnish any article or book as premium for subscriptions for    \"Birds.\"                      Address,            #_Nature Study Publishing Co.    Chicago, Ill._#          #Nature Study Publishing Company.#    The Nature Study Publishing Company is a corporation of educators and  business men organized to furnish correct reproductions of the colors  and forms of nature to families, schools, and scientists. Having  secured the services of artists who have succeeded in photographing  and reproducing objects in their natural colors, by a process whose  principles are well known but in which many of the details are held  secret, we obtained a charter from the Secretary of State in November,  1896, and began at once the preparation of photographic color plates  for a series of pictures of birds.    The first product was the January number of \"BIRDS,\" a monthly  magazine, containing ten plates with descriptions in popular language,  avoiding as far as possible scientific and technical terms. Knowing  the interest children have in our work, we have included in each  number a few pages of easy text pertaining to the illustrations. These  are usually set facing the plates to heighten the pleasure of the  little folks as they read.    Casually noticed, the magazine may appear to be a children's  publication because of the placing of this juvenile text. But such is  not the case. Those scientists who cherish with delight the famous  handiwork of Audubon are no less enthusiastic over these beautiful  pictures which are painted by the delicate and scientifically accurate  fingers of Light itself. These reproductions are true. There is no  imagination in them nor conventionalism. In the presence of their  absolute truth any written description or work of human hands shrinks  into insignificance. The scientific value of these photographs can not  be estimated.    To establish a great magazine with a world-wide circulation is no  light undertaking. We have been steadily and successfully working  towards that end. Delays have been unavoidable. What was effective for  the production of a limited number of copies was inadequate as our  orders increased. The very success of the enterprise has sometimes  impeded our progress. Ten hundred teachers in Chicago paid  subscriptions in ten days. Boards of Education are subscribing in  hundred lots. Improvements in the process have been made in almost  every number, and we are now assured of a brilliant and useful future.    When \"BIRDS\" has won its proper place in public favor we shall be  prepared to issue a similar serial on other natural objects, and look  for an equally cordial reception for it.      #PREMIUMS.#    To teachers we give duplicates of all the pictures on separate sheets  for use in teaching or for decoration.    To other subscribers we give a color photograph of one of the most  gorgeous birds, the Golden Pheasant.    Subscriptions, $1.50 a year including one premium. Those wishing both  premiums may receive them and a year's subscription for $2.00.    We have just completed an edition of 50,000 back numbers to  accommodate those who wish their subscriptions to date back to  January, 1897, the first number.    We will furnish the first volume, January to June inclusive, well  bound in cloth, postage paid, for $1.25. In Morocco, $2.25.      #AGENTS.#    10,000 agents are wanted to travel or solicit at home.    We have prepared a fine list of desirable premiums for clubs which any  popular adult or child can easily form. Your friends will thank you  for showing them the magazine and offering to send their money. The  work of getting subscribers among acquaintances is easy and  delightful. Agents can do well selling the bound volume. Vol. 1 is the  best possible present for a young person or for anyone specially  interested in nature.    Teachers and others meeting them at institutes do well as our agents.  The magazine sells to teachers better than any other publication  because they can use the extra plates for decoration, language work,  nature study, and individual occupation.                                NATURE STUDY PUBLISHING COMPANY,                                    277 Dearborn Street, CHICAGO.          #OUR PREMIUMS#      THE GOLDEN PHEASANT, a picture of wonderful beauty, almost life-size,  in a natural scene, plate 13 x 18 inches, on card 19 x 25 inches, is  given to Annual Subscribers. The price on this picture in art stores  is $3.50.    Instead of the GOLDEN PHEASANT, teachers who prefer may have duplicate  pictures of each bird each month, on a separate sheet, to use in the  school-room.      #OUR SPECIAL SUMMER OFFER#    To subscribers whose cash for subscriptions reaches us before  September 1, 1897, we will send both the Golden Pheasant and the  duplicate pictures. The Golden Pheasant is admired by every one as a  work of art. The duplicate pictures can be framed with good effect, or  given to some of your friends. Through June, July and August, we are  sending these pictures to all our subscribers. Enclose them in letters  to your friends, and ask them to subscribe through you. Tell them you  are getting subscriptions for \"Birds,\" in order to secure some  premium--a choice book, a camera with complete outfit, a bicycle or  anything else you want, whether in our list or not. During the summer  vacation, any one can get ninety subscriptions, which will insure you  one of the best wheels you or your friends ever have ridden.    Price of \"Birds,\" with Golden Pheasant and one hundred and twenty  pictures (ten each month), $1.50. This offer is made until September  1, 1897.                   #Nature Study Publishing Co.,#                         #CHICAGO, ILL.#"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],[0,"The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#9)"],[1,"there's fun of some sort in being  anybody, even a-a-a--\"    \"Even a _what?_\" Henrietta snapped. \"Were you going to say a _Hen?_\"    \"I was,\" Spot replied. \"But I remembered that it wouldn't be polite.\"    \"I should say not!\" Henrietta Hen cackled. \"I should say not!\" And then,  being very angry, she hurried off to tell the rooster what had happened.    \"I'll have to be careful how I talk to these farmyard folks,\" Spot  muttered. \"They haven't had a chance to learn some of the things that I  know.    \"For I've been to the village and seen the world--and the circus, too,\"  added old dog Spot.
