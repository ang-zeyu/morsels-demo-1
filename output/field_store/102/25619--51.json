[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#9)"],[1,"actually exists as an  invisible world within which the visible world is immersed like an  island in an unexplored ocean, and that it is peopled by more species of  living beings than this world, because incomparably more vast and varied  in its possibilities.    We should be prepared in hearing the evidence to meet with some  contradictions and a good deal of confusion, for many of the people who  believe in such a strange world as we have just described, and who think  they sometimes have entered it or have seen some of its inhabitants,  have often had no training at all in schools or colleges. But when we  hear legendary tales which have never been recorded save in the minds  of unnumbered generations of men, we ought not on that account to  undervalue them; for often they are better authorities and more  trustworthy than many an ancient and carefully inscribed manuscript in  the British Museum; and they are probably far older than the oldest book  in the world. Let us, then, for a time, forget that there are such  things as libraries and universities, and betake ourselves to the Celtic  peasant for instruction, living close to nature as he lives, and  thinking the things which he thinks.    But the peasant will not be our only teacher, for we shall also hear  much of first importance from city folk of the highest intellectual  training. It has become, perhaps always has been in modern times, a  widespread opinion, even among some scholars, that the belief in fairies  is the property solely of simple, uneducated country-folk, and that  people who have had 'a touch of education and a little common sense  knocked into their heads', to use the ordinary language, 'wouldn't be  caught believing in such nonsense.' This same class of critics used to  make similar remarks about people who said there were ghosts, until the  truth of another 'stupid superstition' was discovered by psychical  research. So in this chapter we hope to correct this erroneous opinion  about the Fairy-Faith, an opinion chiefly entertained by scholars and  others who know not the first real fact about fairies, because they have  never lived amongst the people who believe in fairies, but derive all  their information from books and hearsay. In due order the proper sort  of witnesses will substantiate this position, but before coming to their  testimony we may now say that there are men and women in Dublin, in  other parts of Ireland, in Scotland, in the Isle of Man, and in  Brythonic lands too, whom all the world knows as educated leaders in  their respective fields of activity, who not only declare their belief  that fairies were, but that fairies are; and some of these men and women  say that they have the power to see fairies as real spiritual beings.    In the evidence about to be presented there has been no selecting in  favour of any one theory; it is presented as discovered. The only  liberty taken with some of the evidence has been to put it into better  grammatical form, and sometimes to recast an ambiguous statement when I,  as collector, had in my own mind no doubt as to its meaning.  Translations have been made as literal as possible; though sometimes it  has been found better to offer the meaning rather than what in English  would be an obscure colloquialism or idiomatic expression. The method  pursued in seeking the evidence has been to penetrate as deeply and in  as natural a way as possible the thoughts of the people who believe in  fairies and like beings, by living among them and observing their  customs and ways of thought, and recording what seemed relevant to the  subject under investigation--chance expressions, and legends told under  various ordinary conditions--rather than to collect long legends or  literary fairy-stories. For these last the reader is referred to the  many excellent works on Celtic folk-lore. We have sought to bring  together, as perhaps has not been done before, the philosophy of the  belief in fairies, rather than the mere fairy-lore itself, though the  two cannot be separated. In giving the evidence concerning fairies, we  sometimes give evidence which, though akin to it and thus worthy of  record, is not strictly fairy-lore. All that we have omitted from the  materials in the form first taken down are stories and accounts of  things not sufficiently related to the world of Faerie to be of value  here.    In no case has testimony been admitted from a person who was known to be  unreliable, nor even from a person who was thought to be unreliable.  Accordingly, the evidence we are to examine ought to be considered good  evidence so far as it goes; and since it represents almost all known  elements of the Fairy-Faith and contains almost all the essential  elements upon which the advocates of the Naturalistic Theory, of the  Pygmy Theory, of the Druid Theory, of the Mythological Theory, as well  as of our own Psychological Theory, must base their arguments, we  consider it very adequate evidence. Nearly every witness is a Celt who  has been made acquainted with the belief in fairies through direct  contact with people who believe in them, or through having heard  fairy-traditions among his own kindred, or through personal  psychological experiences. And it is exceedingly fortunate for us that  an unusually large proportion of these Celtic witnesses are actual  percipients and natural seers, because the eliminations from the  Fairy-Faith to be brought about in chapter iii by means of an  anthropological analysis of evidence will be so extensive that,  scientifically and strictly speaking, there will remain as a residual or  unknown quantity, upon which our final conclusion must depend, solely  the testimony of reliable seer-witnesses. That is to say, no method of  anthropological dissection of the evidence can force aside consideration  of the ultimate truth which may or may not reside in the testimony of  sane and thoroughly reliable seer-witnesses.    Old and young, educated and uneducated, peasant and city-bred, testify  to the actual existence of the Celtic Fairy-Faith; and the evidence from  Roman Catholics stands beside that from Protestants, the evidence of  priests supports that of scholars and scientists, peasant seers have  testified to the same kind of visions as highly educated seers; and what  poets have said agrees with what is told by business men, engineers, and  lawyers. But the best of witnesses, like ourselves, are only human, and  subject to the shortcomings of the ordinary man, and therefore no claim  can be made in any case to infallibility of evidence: all the world over  men interpret visions pragmatically and sociologically, or hold beliefs  in accord with their own personal experiences; and are for ever  unconsciously immersed in a sea of psychological influences which  sometimes may be explainable through the methods of sociological  inquiry, sometimes may be supernormal in origin and nature, and hence to  be explained most adequately, if at all, through psychical research. Our  study is a study of human nature itself, and, moreover, often of human  nature in its most subtle aspects, which are called psychical; and the  most difficult problem of all is for human nature to interpret and  understand its own ultimate essence and psychological instincts. Our  whole aim is to discover what reasonableness may or may not stand behind  a belief so vast, so ancient, so common (contrary to popular non-Celtic  opinion) to all classes of Celts, and so fundamental a shaping force in  European history, religion, and social institutions.    When we state our conviction that the Fairy-Faith is common to all  classes of Celts, we do not state that it is common to all Celts. The  materialization of the age has affected the Fairy-Faith as it has  affected all religious beliefs the world over. This has been pointed out  by Dr. Hyde, by Dr. Carmichael, and by Mr. Jenner in their respective  introductions for Ireland, Scotland, and Cornwall. Nevertheless, the  Fairy-Faith as the folk-religion of the Celtic peoples is still able to  count its adherents by hundreds of thousands. Even in many cases where  Christian theology has been partially or wholly discarded by educated  Celts, in the country or in the city, as being to them in too many  details out of harmony with accepted scientific truths, the belief in  fairies has been jealously retained, and will, so it would seem, be  retained in the future.    We are now prepared to hear about the _Daoine Maithe_, the 'Good  People', as the Irish call their _Sidhe_ race; about the 'People of  Peace', the 'Still-Folk' or the 'Silent Moving Folk', as the Scotch call  their _Sith_ who live in green knolls and in the mountain fastnesses of  the Highlands; about various Manx fairies; about the _Tylwyth Teg_, the  'Fair-Family' or 'Fair-Folk', as the Welsh people call their fairies;  about Cornish Pixies; and about _Fees_ (fairies), _Corrigans_, and the  Phantoms of the Dead in Brittany. And along with these, for they are  very much akin, let us hear about ghosts--sometimes about ghosts who  discover hidden treasure, as in our story of the _Golden Image_--about  goblins, about various sorts of death-warnings generally coming from  apparitions of the dead, or from banshees, about death-candles and  phantom-funerals, about leprechauns, about hosts of the air, and all  kinds of elementals and spirits--in short, about all the orders of  beings who mingle together in that invisible realm called Fairyland.      II. IN IRELAND         Introduction by DOUGLAS HYDE, LL.D., D. Litt., M.R.I.A. (_An       Craoibhin Aoibhinn_), President of the Gaelic League; author of _A       Literary History of Ireland_, &c.    Whatever may be thought of the conclusions drawn by Mr. Wentz from his  explorations into the Irish spirit-world, there can be no doubt as to  the accuracy of the data from which he draws them. I have myself been  for nearly a quarter of a century collecting, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#9)"],[1,"meeting, seized Christabel and dragged her down  the aisle, past the platform, other men following with Annie Kenney,  both girls still calling for an answer to their question. On the  platform the Liberal leaders sat silent and unmoved while this  disgraceful scene was taking place, and the mob were shouting and  shrieking from the floor.    Flung into the streets, the two girls staggered to their feet and began  to address the crowds, and to tell them what had taken place in a  Liberal meeting. Within five minutes they were arrested on a charge of  obstruction and, in Christabel's case, of assaulting the police. Both  were summonsed to appear next morning in a police court, where, after a  trial which was a mere farce, Annie Kenney was sentenced to pay a fine  of five shillings, with an alternative of three days in prison, and  Christabel Pankhurst was given a fine of ten shillings or a jail  sentence of one week.    Both girls promptly chose the prison sentence. As soon as they left the  court-room I hurried around to the room where they were waiting, and I  said to my daughter: \"You have done everything you could be expected to  do in this matter. I think you should let me pay your fines and take you  home.\" Without waiting for Annie Kenney to speak, my daughter exclaimed:  \"Mother, if you pay my fine I will never go home.\" Before going to the  meeting she had said, \"We will get our question answered or sleep in  prison to-night.\" I now knew her courage remained unshaken.    Of course the affair created a tremendous sensation, not only in  Manchester, where my husband had been so well known and where I had so  long held public office, but all over England. The comments of the press  were almost unanimously bitter. Ignoring the perfectly well-established  fact that men in every political meeting ask questions and demand  answers of the speakers, the newspapers treated the action of the two  girls as something quite unprecedented and outrageous. They generally  agreed that great leniency had been shown them. Fines and jail-sentences  were too good for such unsexed creatures. \"The discipline of the  nursery\" would have been far more appropriate. One Birmingham paper  declared that \"if any argument were required against giving ladies  political status and power it had been furnished in Manchester.\"  Newspapers which had heretofore ignored the whole subject now hinted  that while they had formerly been in favour of women's suffrage, they  could no longer countenance it. The Manchester incident, it was said,  had set the cause back, perhaps irrevocably.    This is how it set the cause back. Scores of people wrote to the  newspapers expressing sympathy with the women. The wife of Sir Edward  Grey told her friends that she considered them quite justified in the  means they had taken. It was stated that Winston Churchill, nervous  about his own candidacy in Manchester, visited Strangeways Gaol, where  the two girls were imprisoned, and vainly begged the governor to allow  him to pay their fines. On October 20, when the prisoners were released,  they were given an immense demonstration in Free-Trade Hall, the very  hall from which they had been ejected the week before. The Women's  Social and Political Union received a large number of new members. Above  all, the question of women's suffrage became at once a live topic of  comment from one end of Great Britain to the other.    We determined that from that time on the little \"Votes For Women\"  banners should appear wherever a prospective member of the Liberal  Government rose to speak, and that there should be no more peace until  the women's question was answered. We clearly perceived that the new  Government, calling themselves Liberal, were reactionary so far as women  were concerned, that they were hostile to women's suffrage, and would  have to be fought until they were conquered, or else driven from office.    We did not begin to fight, however, until we had given the new  Government every chance to give us the pledge we wanted. Early in  December the Conservative Government had gone out, and Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal leader, had formed a new Cabinet. On  December 21 a great meeting was held in Royal Albert Hall, London, where  Sir Henry, surrounded by his cabinet, made his first utterance as Prime  Minister. Previous to the meeting we wrote to Sir Henry and asked him,  in the name of the Women's Social and Political Union, whether the  Liberal Government would give women the vote. We added that our  representatives would be present at the meeting, and we hoped that the  Prime Minister would publicly answer the question. Otherwise we should  be obliged publicly to protest against his silence.    Of course Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman returned no reply, nor did his  speech contain any allusion to women's suffrage. So, at the conclusion,  Annie Kenney, whom we had smuggled into the hall in disguise, whipped  out her little white calico banner, and called out in her clear, sweet  voice: \"Will the Liberal Government give women the vote?\"    At the same moment Theresa Billington let drop from a seat directly  above the platform a huge banner with the words: \"Will the Liberal  Government give justice to working-women?\" Just for a moment there was a  gasping silence, the people waiting to see what the Cabinet Ministers  would do. They did nothing. Then, in the midst of uproar and conflicting  shouts, the women were seized and flung out of the hall.    This was the beginning of a campaign the like of which was never known  in England, or, for that matter, in any other country. If we had been  strong enough we should have opposed the election of every Liberal  candidate, but being limited both in funds and in members we  concentrated on one member of the Government, Mr. Winston Churchill. Not  that we had any animus against Mr. Churchill. We chose him simply  because he was the only important candidate standing for constituencies  within reach of our headquarters. We attended every meeting addressed by  Mr. Churchill. We heckled him unmercifully; we spoiled his best points  by flinging back such obvious retorts that the crowds roared with  laughter. We lifted out little white banners from unexpected corners of  the hall, exactly at the moment when an interruption was least desired.  Sometimes our banners were torn from our hands and trodden under foot.  Sometimes, again, the crowds were with us, and we actually broke up the  meeting. We did not succeed in defeating Mr. Churchill, but he was  returned by a very small majority, the smallest of any of the Manchester  Liberal candidates.    We did not confine our efforts to heckling Mr. Churchill. Throughout the  campaign we kept up the work of questioning Cabinet Ministers at  meetings all over England and Scotland. At Sun Hall, Liverpool,  addressed by the Prime Minister, nine women in succession asked the  important question, and were thrown out of the hall; this in the face of  the fact that Sir Campbell-Bannerman was an avowed suffragist. But we  were not questioning him as to his private opinions on the suffrage; we  were asking him what his Government were willing to do about suffrage.  We questioned Mr. Asquith in Sheffield, Mr. Lloyd-George in Altrincham,  Cheshire, the Prime Minister again in Glasgow, and we interrupted a  great many other meetings as well. Always we were violently thrown out  and insulted. Often we were painfully bruised and hurt.    What good did it do? We have often been asked that question, even by the  women our actions spurred into an activity they had never before thought  themselves capable of. For one thing, our heckling campaign made women's  suffrage a matter of news--it had never been that before. Now the  newspapers were full of us. For another thing, we woke up the old  suffrage associations. During the general election various groups of  non-militant suffragists came back to life and organised a gigantic  manifesto in favour of action from the Liberal Government. Among others,  the manifesto was signed by the Women's Co-operative Guild with nearly  21,000 members; the Women's Liberal Federation, with 76,000 members; the  Scottish Women's Liberal Federation, with 15,000 members; the  North-of-England Weavers' Association, with 100,000 members; the British  Women's Temperance Association, with nearly 110,000 members; and the  Independent Labour Party with 20,000 members. Surely it was something to  have inspired all this activity.    We decided that the next step must be to carry the fight to London, and  Annie Kenney was chosen to be organiser there. With only two pounds,  less than ten dollars, in her pocket the intrepid girl set forth on her  mission. In about a fortnight I left my official work as registrar in  the hands of a deputy and went down to London to see what had been  accomplished. To my astonishment I found that Annie, working with my  daughter Sylvia, had organised a procession of women and a demonstration  to be held on the opening day of Parliament. The confident young things  had actually engaged Caxton Hall, Westminster; they had had printed a  large number of handbills to announce the meeting, and they were busily  engaged in working up the demonstration. Mrs. Drummond, who had joined  the Union shortly after the imprisonment of Annie Kenney and Christabel,  sent word from Manchester that she was coming to help us. She had to  borrow the money for her railroad-fare, but she came, and, as ever  before and since, her help was invaluable.    How we worked, distributing handbills, chalking announcements of the  meeting on pavements, calling on every person we knew and on a great  many more we knew only by name, canvassing from door to door!    At length the opening day of Parliament arrived. On February 19, 1906,  occurred the first suffrage procession in London. I think there were  between three and four hundred women in that procession, poor"]]]
