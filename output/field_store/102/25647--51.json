For my own part, I admired him  for performing that solemn office himself rather than hiring an underling  to do it. But if he had been a book-auctioneer, I might have been  prejudiced against him.    Not so ignoble and inhuman perhaps as that of the slave-seller, still the  business must breed a sort of callousness which is abhorrent to the genial  Book-Worm. How I hate the glib rattle of his tongue, the mouldiness of his  jests and the transparency of his puffery! I should think he would hate  himself. It must be worse than acting Hamlet or Humpty Dumpty a hundred  consecutive nights. Dante had no punishment for the Book-Worm in hell,  if I remember right, but if he deserved any pitiless reprobation, it would  be found in compelling him to cry off books to all eternity. Grant that  the auctioneer is a person of sensibility and acquainted with good books,  then his calling must give him many a pang as he observes the ignorance  and carelessness of his audience. It is better and more fitting that he  should know little of his wares. He ought to be well paid for his work,  and he is--no man gets so much for mere talk except the lawyer, and  perhaps not even he. I do not so much complain of his favoritism. When  there is something especially desirable going, I frequently fail to catch  his eye, and my rival gets the prize. But in this he is no worse than  the Speaker. On the other hand he sometimes loads me up with a thing that  I do not want, and in possession of which I would be unwilling to be found  dead, pretending that I winked at him--a species of imposition which it is  impolitic to resent for fear of being entirely ignored. These  discretionary favors are regarded as a practical joke and must not be  declined. But what I do complain of is his commercial stolidity,  surpassing that of Charles Surface when he sold the portraits of his  ancestors. The \"bete noir\" of the book trade is      THE STOLID AUCTIONEER.        Let not a sad ghost      From the scribbling host    Revisit this workaday sphere;      He'll find in the sequel      All talents are equal    When they come to the auctioneer.        Not a whit cares he      What the book may be,    Whether missal with glorious show,      A folio Shakespeare,      Or an Elzevir,    Or a Tupper, or E. P. Roe.        Without any qualms      He knocks down the Psalms,    Or the chaste Imitatio,      And takes the same pains      To enhance his gains    With a ribald Boccaccio.        He rattles them off,      Not stopping to cough,    He shows no distinction of person;      One minute's enough      For similar stuff    Like Shelley and Ossian Macpherson.        A Paradise Lost      Is had for less cost    Than a bulky \"fifteener\" in Greek,      And Addison's prose      Quite frequently goes    For a tenth of a worthless \"unique.\"        This formula stale      Of his will avail    For an epitaph meet for his rank,      When dropping his gavel      He falls in the gravel,    \"Do I hear nothing more?--gone--to--?    I speak feelingly, but I think it is pardonable. I once went through an  auction sale of my own books, and while I lost money on volumes on which I  had bestowed much thought, labor and expense, I made a profit on Gibbon's  \"Decline and Fall\" in tree-calf. I do not complain of the loss; what I was  mortified by was the profit. But the auctioneer was not at all abashed; in  fact he seemed rather pleased, and apparently regarded it as a feather in  his cap. I have always suspected that the shameless purchaser was Silas  Wegg.          XI.    THE BOOKSELLER.      Considering his importance in modern civilization, it is singular that so  little has been recorded of the Bookseller in literature. Shakespeare has  a great deal to say of books of various kinds, but not a word, I believe,  of the Bookseller. It is true that Ursa Major gave a mitigated growl of  applause to the booksellers, if I recollect my Boswell right, and he  condescended to write a life of Cave, but bookseller in his view meant  publisher. It is true that Charles Knight wrote a book entitled \"Shadows  of the Old Booksellers,\" but here too the characters were mainly  publishers, and his account of them is indeed shadowy. The chief thing  that I recall about any of the booksellers thus celebrated is that Tom  Davies had \"a pretty wife,\" which is probably the reason why Doctor  Johnson thought Tom would better have stuck to the stage. So far as I  know, the most vivid pen-pictures of booksellers are those depicting the  humble members of the craft, the curb-stone venders. They are much more  picturesque than their more affluent brethren who are used to the luxury  of a roof.          Rummaging over the contents of an old stall, at a half book, half old      iron shop in Ninety-four alley, leading from Wardour street to Soho,      yesterday, I lit upon a ragged duodecimo, which has been the strange      delight of my infancy; the price demanded was sixpence, which the      owner (a little squab duodecimo of a character himself) enforced with      the assurance that his own mother should not have it for a farthing      less. On my demurring to this extraordinary assertion, the dirty      little vender reinforced his assertion with a sort of oath, which      seemed more than the occasion demanded. \"And now,\" said he, \"I have      put my soul to it.\" Pressed by so solemn an asseveration, I could no      longer resist a demand which seemed to set me, however unworthy, upon      a level with his nearest relations; and depositing a tester, I bore      away the battered prize in triumph.        --Essays of Elia.      Monsieur Uzanne, who has treated of the elegancies of the Fan, the Muff,  and the Umbrella, has more recently given the world a quite unique series  of studies among the bookstalls and the quays of Paris--\"The Book Hunter  in Paris\"--and this too one finds more entertaining than any account of  Quaritch's or Putnam's shop would be.    I must bear witness to the honesty and liberality of booksellers. When one  considers the hundreds of catalogues from which he has ordered books at a  venture, even from across the ocean, and how seldom he has been misled or  disappointed in the result, one cannot subscribe to a belief in the dogma  of total depravity. I remember some of my booksellers with positive  affection. They were such self-denying men to consent to part with their  treasures at any price. And as a rule they are far more careless than  ordinary merchants about getting or securing their pay. To be sure it is  rather ignoble for the painter of a picture, or the chiseller of a statue,  or the vender of a fine book, to affect the acuteness of tradesmen in the  matter of compensation. The excellent bookseller takes it for granted, if  he stoops to think about it, that if a man orders a Caxton or a Grolier he  will pay for it, at his convenience. It was this unthinking liberality  which led a New York bookseller to give credit to a distinguished  person--afterwards a candidate for the Presidency--to a considerable  amount, and to let the account stand until it was outlawed, and his  sensibilities were greviously shocked, when being compelled to sue for his  due, his debtor pleaded the statute of limitations! His faith was not  restored even when the acute buyer left a great sum of money by his will  to found a public library, and the legacy failed through informality.    I have only one complaint to make against booksellers. They should teach  their clerks to recognize The Book-Worm at a glance. It is very  annoying, when I go browsing around a book-shop, to have an attendant come  up and ask me, who have bought books for thirty years, if he can \"show me  anything\"--just as if I wanted to see anything in particular--or if  \"anybody is waiting on me\"--when all I desire is to be let alone. Some  booksellers, I am convinced, have this art of recognition, for they let me  alone, and I make it a rule always to buy something of them, but never  when their employees are so annoyingly attentive. I do not object to being  watched; it is only the implication that I need any assistance that  offends me. It is easy to recognize the Book-Worm at a glance by the care  with which he handles the rare books and the indifference with which he  passes the standard authors in holiday bindings.    Once I had a bookseller who had a talent for drawing, which he used to  exercise occasionally on the exterior of an express package of books. One  of these wrappings I have preserved, exhibiting a pen-and-ink drawing of a  war-ship firing a big gun at a few small birds. Perhaps this was  satirically intended to denote the pains and time he had expended on so  small a sale. But I will now immortalize him.    The most striking picture of a bookseller that I recall in all literature  is one drawn by M. Uzanne, in the charming book mentioned above, which I  will endeavor to transmute and transmit under the title of      THE PROPHETIC BOOK.      \"La Croix,\" said the Emperor, \"cease to beguile;      These bookstalls must go from my bridges and quays;    No longer shall tradesmen my city defile      With mouldering hideous scarecrows like these.\"      While walking that night with the bibliophile,      On the Quai Malaquais by the Rue de Saints Peres,    The Emperor saw, with satirical smile,      Enkindling his stove, in the chill evening air,      With leaves which he tore from a tome by his side,      A bookseller ancient, with tremulous hands;    And laying aside his imperial pride,      \"What book are you burning?\" the Emperor demands.      For answer Pere Foy handed over the book,      And there as the headlines saluted his glance,    Napoleon read, with a stupefied look,      \"Account of the Conquests and Victories of France.\"      The dreamer imperial swallowed his ire;      Pere Foy still remained at his musty old stand,    Till France was environed by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#9)"],[1,"sand, is lost. The war  thus made is an equal one: you attack him on his own ground in his  fortress where he is acquainted with every passage, gallery, and  casement; he is armed to the teeth and armour-plated, and can drive a  road forward, downward, or upward with extraordinary rapidity. It is  true you may have many terriers, but he has an advantage over your  forces. Only one of your dogs can engage at a time, and the badger has  the advantage of weight, size, knowledge of the ground, and familiarity  with the dark--in fact, in every respect except those of courage and  endurance, which in some terriers may equal his own. The other method,  less sure, depends on taking the badger off his guard, and is more in  the character of an ambuscade under cover of night. When the badgers are  away from home you block up their earths, placing sacks with running  nooses in the mouth, in the most frequented holes. Station one of your  party near the \"set,\" and you may either take a small pack of hounds and  draw the country for a few miles round, and hunt him like a fox, getting  a run across country and a fine cry; or you may beat the neighbouring  coverts with men and dogs of any description that are trained to hunt  the badger.    In the following, taken from an article which appeared in a newspaper,  there is a good account of night hunting.    \"Owing to his shy and retiring habits, rather than to the scarcity of  the animal, probably less is known about the badger than about any wild  animal left in England at the present time. There is a prevalent notion  that the badger is exceedingly rare, and also that he is harmless;  neither of these ideas is quite correct. In the west especially the  badger is fairly common, but escapes notice owing to his retiring  disposition. Whether he does harm to feathered game or not is a moot  point, but his tracks have been distinctly noticed round plundered  nests; it is certain, however, that he does great damage to ground game  by digging out 'stops' of young rabbits in the spring and summer.    \"When hunted after the fashion generally adopted in the west, he affords  excellent sport to those who are prepared to face a long tramp and the  loss of some of their night's rest. The prosaic way of digging them out  of the earth involves much labour, and has in it no element of sport;  while attempting to catch badgers in traps is about as feasible as  trying to catch birds by putting salt on their tails. Driving them into  sacks fixed in the earth is unsatisfactory, as a good game dog is  necessary to press the badger hard, or he will turn from the earth and  seek shelter elsewhere; while, if you have a good dog, the sacks are  unnecessary except for the reception of the badger when caught by the  dog.    \"The paraphernalia of the chase are simple, namely, a good dog, a pair  of badger-tongs, and a sack. A really good dog is very difficult to  obtain; the favourite kind is a cross-bred bull-terrier, about forty  pounds in weight; pure-bred bull-terriers, for some reason or other, do  not seem to give satisfaction. The 'tongs' have wooden handles, and iron  heads with blunt teeth for grasping the badger when held by the dog. For  a successful hunt it is necessary to observe which way the badger  travels from the earth. A favourite spot is the slope of a hill, or  high-lying fields, where they may be easily tracked by the 'roots,'  _i.e._ small holes which they scratch in the ground in search of  beetles and roots of various kinds. They rarely descend into low-lying  meadows, except to drink. Choose a starlight night with a slight breeze  blowing, and approach the earth up the wind. Do not hurry your dog; if  he knows his work, he will range freely, but he often takes a long time  to puzzle out the track. If you miss him, go on slowly in the direction  in which you last saw him, often stopping to listen.    \"'What was that?' The dry sticks crack in a hedge far below you. 'Hark!  two sharp eager barks; what does it mean?' Why, that Grip is wheeling  out in a half-circle to gain slightly on the badger, and then to dash in  and get him by the head. Run now as you never ran before. Head over  heels into a ditch; never mind, up and on again--the best dog can't hold  a badger for ever. There they are out in the open, Grip with a tight  hold of the badger by the side of the head, with his legs tucked back  out of harm's way. Grasp him with the tongs as near the neck as  possible. Take off the dog, some one. Hold the bag. Hoist our  grey-coated friend into the air, and lower him into the sack; he weighs  at least thirty pounds. The dog is hardly marked, and you haven't torn  more than three rents in your nether garments getting through that last  thorn hedge. Altogether, every one agrees that it was a satisfactory  little run.    \"The old English sheep-dog I have known do well for the other method.  The badger when pursued makes straight for home, blunders headlong into  the hole, only to find that his efforts to get in are closing the mouth  of the sack, that retreat or fighting are alike in vain, and that he is  an imprisoned bagman, without having struck a blow in self-defence. It  is not uncommon for a badger thus pursued to stand at bay, when a good  dog may keep him in play, or hold on, till you come up and secure him.  No doubt there is amusement and excitement in this moonlight chase, and  to some it is preferable to the arduous labour with pick, spade, axe,  and terrier.\"    To my mind, however, there is something more interesting and exciting in  the long-sustained conflict and labour of the latter, for which you  require perseverance, wit, patience, and courage on the part of man and  terrier. The courage and endurance that a good terrier will display when  need requires before such a foe, will fill his owner's heart with joy  and pride. A good terrier is a veritable treasure; the price of a sure,  game, and determined one is far above rubies. Picture what it means for  a small terrier to enter into the bowels of the earth to find, to cope  with, and for long hours in dust and darkness in the tortuous maze to  keep up an unequal fight with an enormously superior foe, whose grunts  and clattering teeth add terror to his charges down the echoing ways.  Yet I have had not a few that, hour after hour, on their backs or their  sides, would lie up to a badger, keeping him cornered, and continuously  give tongue with no voice to direct them. Should the badger charge, such  a terrier would rather die than let him leave the corner to which he has  been driven, and will return fighting and facing his huge opponent,  driving him inch by inch into the _cul de sac_, caring neither for bite  nor wounds, and making noise enough to let you know where the battle  rages. It is no part of his duty to tackle the badger. A good terrier  knows this, and will only resort to his teeth should the badger attempt  to force a passage. If it comes to close quarters, such a terrier will  draw back his fore-legs under his body, take the attack full in the  face, and trust to seizing the badger by the neck. A badger when  attacked generally bites upwards, _i. e._ he lowers his head and turns  the back of his head downwards. Nothing makes the heart beat faster  than, with head to the earth, to hear the din of this subterranean  warfare carried along the dark galleries to the day. You have sent in  one of your best terriers; he has tried by cajolery and caresses, by  cries, by straining at his chain to be allowed the honourable  distinction of first blood. You have dispatched him with your blessing,  and he has quickly and silently started on his journey into the unknown.  You listen to him forcing his passage, drawing himself round corners,  scratching away some accumulation or fall from the roof, and hear his  eager panting as he winds his foe. Presently you hear a low sharp bark,  then another, then two or three more, next a bumping, thumping noise; it  is the badger, who has waited to see who the intruder is, and, rousing  himself, is retreating. The terrier barks no more, but you can hear the  thump-thump of the badger, followed by the efforts of the dog to keep up  with him. They are now a long way in, and you can plainly hear the bark  again. Soon the fight draws nearer, and the terrier's cry comes to your  ear with regularity and clearness; but the badger is only disputing the  way, he has not yet been driven with his back against the wall. The  terrier redoubles his activity, you can hear him feinting at the badger,  sharp give-and-take, but no foolish attempt to lay hold. After ten  minutes the badger again retreats, probably up the hill, and you have to  listen on the surface or at the higher holes of the set till you can  hear them again. At last you catch a faint sound, they are still moving,  now stationary, now further on; then they seem to stay in one place.  There is the steady yap-yap-yap of the dog just distinguishable to the  ear.    Quick, every hand to work. A trench six feet deep, or deeper if  necessary, must be cut across the set to cut off the badger from the  passages. With pick, spade, and shovel the work goes on, while some one  listens to know whether the scene of battle moves. If it does, the  badger may have found a side gallery, and gone far enough, or he may  have charged the dog. He may have passed by a different road beneath  your feet in the trench; but if the terrier has succeeded in keeping him  face to face and engaged, yet not driving him so hard as to make him  charge, you may be successful in an hour or two, and find that your  cutting intersects the passage in which the badger and the terrier are  engaged. If the badger suspects you are cutting off his only means of  escape he will charge and fight, and the terrier will sometimes be  unable to back fast enough; then there will be a meeting of teeth and  jaws, the badger holding the dog through the head, jaw, or nose."]]]
