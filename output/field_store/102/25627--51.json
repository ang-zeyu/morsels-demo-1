CAUTIONS AS TO YOUTH.      In relation to _early_ sexual association, it cannot be doubted, that,  when the instinct of reproduction begins to be developed, the reserve  which parents, relatives, and instructers, adopt on this subject, is often  the means of producing injurious effects; because, a system of concealment  on this subject, as observed in the preceding chapter, is quite  impracticable. Discoveries made by young persons in obscene books, the  unguarded language or shameless conduct of grown-up persons, even the wild  flights of an imagination which is then easily excited, will have the most  fatal consequences.    Parents or instructers ought, therefore, at that critical period, to give  rational explanations as to the nature and the object of the propensity,  the mechanism of reproduction in various vegetable and animal beings, and  the fatal consequences to which this propensity may lead. Such procedure,  if well conducted, cannot but have the most beneficial results; because,  in order that a sane person should avoid any danger, it is only necessary  that he should see it distinctly.    The advantage, it has been observed, which the parent, relative, or  instructer, derives, from himself in forming the adolescent in the new  faculty which is developed in him, is to prevent his choosing, among  corrupt servants or ignorant youths of his own age, the confidants of his  passion. The parent or instructer, moreover, is then justly entitled to,  and has gratefully given to him, the entire confidence of the adolescent;  and he is thereby enabled exactly to appreciate the degree of power of the  propensity which he desires to divert or to guide.    Such being the case, it is the business of the parent to present a true  picture of the effects of too early association of this kind, on the  stature, the various development of the figure, the muscular power, the  quality of the voice, the health, the moral sense, and especially on the  acuteness, the power, the dignity, and the courage, of the mind.    In doing this, it would be as stupid as injurious to employ the slightest  degree of false representation, of unjust reprimand, or too much of what  is called moralizing, which is often only the contemptible cant of a being  who cannot reason, especially when it takes the place of a simple and  powerful statement of facts. All of these would only render the young man  a dissembler, and would compel him to choose another confidant.    Among other considerations, varying according to the circumstances of the  case, those stated below may with advantage be presented.    At a certain period in the life both of plants and animals, varying  according to their kind and the climate they live in, they are fit for  and disposed to the reproduction of their species. The sexes in both are  then attracted to each other. In plants, the powder termed pollen, in  animals a peculiar liquid which, deriving its name by analogy from the  seeds of plants, is termed seminal, is secreted by the male plant or  animal, and, by organs differently formed in each kind, is cast upon ova  or eggs either contained within, or deposited by, the female. The details  of this process are among the most beautiful and interesting of the living  economy. In mankind, the attainment of this period is termed puberty.    It is with this critical period, and his conduct during it, that all that  the youth deems most valuable, all that can decide his fortunes and his  happiness in the world, his stature, figure, strength, voice, health, and  mental powers, are most intimately connected.    In regard to stature, the body appears to complete its increase in height  chiefly at the age of puberty, and during the first years which succeed  that age. To be assured of the powerful influence of his own conduct, at  this period, upon his stature, the youth has only to compare the tall men  and women of the country as in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland,  Cumberland, and the Scottish borders, where they have not been overworked,  with the stunted and dwarfed creatures of the metropolis, where a  stranger, when he first enters it, is apt to think he sees so many ugly  boys and girls, whereas, they are full-grown London men and women. Half  the population of the metropolis is affected in this way; and it is the  obvious consequence of the acceleration of puberty by confinement,  stimulating food, indecent plays, and sexual association.    In regard to the perfect development and beauty of the figure, the youth  is probably aware that the most beautiful races of horses and dogs rapidly  deteriorate, if men do not carefully maintain them by continence as well  as by crossing. The too early employment, the depraved abuses, the injury,  or the removal, of the sexual organs, are all of them causes still more  certain of deformity. The latter of these causes acts, of course, most  obviously; and it is evidenced in the almost universal malformation of  eunuchs, geldings, &c.    That, in regard to bodily strength, sexual continence adds energy to the  muscular fibre, is clearly seen by observing the most ardent quadrupeds  previous to the time of the union of their sexes. But, this being past,  precisely in the same proportion does the act of reproduction debilitate  and break down the strongest animal. Many male animals even fall almost  exhausted by a single act of union with the opposite sex.    Every classical student has read the beautiful allegory of Hercules, who,  having spun at the knees of Omphale ([Greek: omphalos] the navel, here put  for the most essential part of the female generative organ), thereby lost  his strength: this beautifully expresses the abasement of power amid the  indulgences of love. Euripides also depicts the terrible Achilles as timid  before women, and respectful with Clytemnestra and Iphigenia. Hence, when  a foolish lord reproached the poet Dryden with having given too much  timidity toward women to a personage in one of his tragedies, and added  that he knew better how to employ his time with the ladies, the poet  answered: \"You now acknowledge that you are no hero, which I intended that  personage to be.\"    As to voice, which depends on the muscles of respiration, and more  immediately on those of the mouth and throat, as general strength does on  the muscles of the whole body, both merely affording expressions of the  mind, the influence of the sexual union upon it is prodigious. How  entirely it is altered by the removal of the testes in eunuchs is known to  every one: in corresponding proportion, is it altered by every act of the  generative organs, but especially by sexual indulgence during puberty. The  horrible voice of early libertines and prostitutes presents an alarming  example of this. To those who value voice in conversation, in the  delightful and humanizing exercise of music, or in the grander efforts of  public speaking, nothing more need be said.    As to health, the less we are prodigal of life, the longer we preserve it.  Every one capable of observing may see that the stag loses his horns and  his hair after procreation; that birds fall into moulting and sadness; and  that male insects even perish after this effort, as if they yielded their  individual life to their progeny. Indeed, everything perishes so much the  more readily, as it has thus transmitted life to its descendants, or has  cast it away in vain pleasures.    In mankind, as in other animals, to procreate is in effect to die to one's  self, and to leave one's life to posterity; especially, if this takes  place in early life. It is then that man becomes bald and bent; and that  the charms of woman fade. Even in advanced age, epicures are so well aware  of this, that they are known to abstain from amorous excess, as the  acknowledged cause of premature death.    In relation to mind--as the generative power is the source of several  characteristics of genius, the exhaustion of that power at an early age  must take away these characteristics. Genius as surely languishes and is  extinguished amid early sexual indulgence, as do the faculties of voice  and locomotion, which are merely its signs and expressions.    It is thus with all our faculties, locomotive, vital, mental, at an early  age. They are strengthened by all that they do not dissipate; and that  which their organs too abundantly dispense is not only taken immediately  from their own power, and mediately from that of the other organs, but it  ensures the permanent debility of the whole.    It is true that the strong passions which are modified or characterized by  the sexual impulse, excite the imagination and impel the mind to sublime  exertions; but the sole means of either obtaining or preserving such  impulsion is, to shun the indulgence of pleasure in early life, and its  waste at later periods.    It has accordingly been observed, that the passion of love appears to be  most excessive in animals which least excel in mental faculties. Thus the  beasts which are the most lascivious, the ass, the boar, &c., are also the  most stupid; and idiots and cretins display a sensuality which brutifies  them still more. Hence, the Homeric fable that Circe transformed men into  beasts.    It would also appear that the most stupid animals, swine, rabbits, &c., in  general produce the greatest number of young; while men of genius have  engendered the fewest. It is remarked that none of the greatest men of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#9)"],[1," and Oaxaca and from the Atlantic slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental  in northern Oaxaca.

A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to  point above insertion of forearm, covering upper edge of tympanum;  tympanum round, its diameter equal to its distance from eye. Forearm  moderately robust, having faint dermal fold on wrist; row of low,  rounded tubercles along ventrolateral edge of forearm; pollex only  slightly enlarged, bearing triangular patch of moderate-sized,  pointed, horn-covered spines (38 on right, 43 on left); second finger  noticeably shorter than fourth; subarticular tubercles round, distal  one on fourth finger bifid; discs of fingers of moderate size, that of  third finger slightly smaller than diameter of tympanum; vestigial web  between first and second fingers; other fingers one-third webbed.  Heels broadly overlapping when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal  articulation reaches to middle of eye; distinct, but low, tarsal fold  extending length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle elevated, flat,  and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle small and round, near base  of fourth toe; row of low indistinct tubercles from heel to base of  fifth toe; subarticular tubercles round; length of toes from shortest  to longest 1-2-3-5-4, the third and fifth being about equal in length;  third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc; fourth toe webbed to base  of penultimate phalanx; discs of toes slightly smaller than those on  fingers. Anal opening near upper edge of thighs; opening bordered  laterally by moderately heavy dermal folds and ventrolaterally by  tubercles. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of forelimbs and shanks  smooth; that of throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs  granular. Ventrolateral glands barely evident. Tongue ovoid, barely  notched behind and slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-3,  situated on V-shaped elevations between round inner nares; openings  to vocal sac large, one situated along inner posterior edge of each  mandibular ramus.    Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs grayish tan with dark  brown reticulations on head and body and dark brown transverse bars or  spots on limbs; first and second fingers cream color; third and fourth  fingers and webbing on hands pale grayish brown; anterior surfaces of  thighs reddish tan; posterior surfaces of thighs yellowish tan; tarsi  and toes pale grayish tan with brown flecks; webbing on foot pale  brown; faint white stripe along ventrolateral edges of tarsi and  forearms; narrow white line above and beside anal opening; no white  stripe on edge of upper lip; axilla pale flesh-color; throat, chest,  and ventral surfaces of limbs pale creamy gray; belly white with  scattered brown flecks; flanks grayish white with dark brown flecks;  ventral surfaces of tarsi dark brown; ventrolateral glands grayish  tan.    In life the dorsal ground-color of the head, body, fore limbs, and  thighs was yellowish tan (Pinkish Buff); dorsal surfaces of shanks and  tarsi pale yellowish tan (Pale Pinkish Buff); markings on head and  back brown (Snuff Brown) to dark brown (Chocolate); dark bands on  limbs brown (Tawny-Olive); first and second fingers creamy tan (Light  Pinkish Cinnamon); posterior surfaces of thighs creamy tan (Light  Pinkish Cinnamon); third and fourth fingers and webbing on hand  grayish brown (Avellaneous); webbing on feet dark brown (Olive Brown);  axilla pale pink (Hydrangea Pink); flanks buff (Cream-Buff) becoming  yellow (Lemon Chrome) in groin; spots on flanks dark brown (Clove  Brown); iris dull grayish bronze (Orange-Citrine).    _Variation._--The distal subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth  finger is bifid in about two-thirds of the specimens; in the rest it  is round. The posterior edge of the tongue varies from being  emarginate to shallowly notched. In most specimens the row of  tubercles along the outer edge of the tarsus is made up of discrete  tubercles, but in some individuals the tubercles form a nearly  continuous dermal fold. Most specimens have the vomerine teeth  situated on V-shaped elevations, but in some individuals the  elevations are more nearly transversely situated between the inner  nares.    All 42 specimens from Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala, have dark brown  spots and flecks on the venter. Some individuals have only a few  flecks on the throat and a few large spots on the flanks, as does KU  64125. Other specimens, such as KU 64132, have dense spotting over the  entire venter. The color of the dorsum varies from pale tan to dark  brown with darker brown markings; the white line above the anus is  present in all specimens, but in some it is indistinct. KU 58053 and  64127 have a dark brown dorsum with large pale tan, square blotches;  in life the blotches were pale tan (Pinkish Buff); the rest of the  dorsum was dark brown (Sayal Brown). KU 58052 is dark brown with many  small white flecks on the dorsum; in life the dorsum was deep olive  brown (Dark Olive).    Aside from the differences mentioned above, all specimens from  Guatemala are similar in coloration. Three specimens from Honduras  (MCZ 21300 and UMMZ 113102-3) have unspotted white venters. MCZ 21300,  the holotype of _P. spinipollex_, lacks a white stripe above the anal  opening, whereas the stripe is indistinct in UMMZ 113102-3.    _Description of tadpole._--The following description is based on KU  60053 from Fina Los Alpes, Depto. Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (Figs. 4D  and 6D). No limb buds; total length, 37.2 mm.; body length, 12.2 mm.;  body length/total length, 32.8 per cent. Body rounded, not depressed,  as wide as deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally;  eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils barely protuberant and  directed anterolaterally, somewhat closer to eye than snout; spiracle  sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin  low, bluntly rounded posteriorly; greatest depth of caudal musculature  about one-half depth of caudal fin; musculature extends nearly to tip  of tail.    Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of  papillae on lips; six or seven rows of papillae laterally; beaks  moderately developed, bearing fine blunt serrations; slender lateral  projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/7; upper rows subequal in  length; fourth row interrupted medially; lower rows 1-4 equal in  length to upper rows; lower rows 5-7 decreasing in length; first lower  row interrupted medially.    Top of head and tip of snout brown; venter creamy gray; caudal  musculature tan; caudal fin transparent; faint cream-colored, narrow,  crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body, not bordered  posteriorly by dark brown mark; brown flecks scattered on caudal  musculature and caudal fin; only a few flecks on anterior half of  ventral caudal fin; eye bronze-color in life.    _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions as compared with  tadpoles of other species is given in Table 2. Of the 57 tadpoles of  this species that I have examined, 21 have only six lower tooth-rows,  although in some of these specimens a faint ridge for a seventh row is  present. In those specimens having "]]]
