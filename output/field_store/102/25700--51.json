Sir  Edmund Bedingfield built it in the reign of Richard III., and Sir  Richard Bedingfield resides there at the present time. The octagonal  towers which flank the entrance gate rise from the broad moat to a  considerable height. There is a quaint projecting turret on the eastern  side which adds considerably to the picturesque outline of stepped  gables and quaint battlements. High above the ponderous oak gates the  machicolation behind the arch that joins the towers shows ample  provision for a liberal supply of molten lead, and in an old guard-room  may be seen the ancient armour and weapons to which the retainers of the  Hall were wont to have recourse in case of siege. The room recalls  somehow the defence of the tower of Tillietudlem in _Old Mortality_, and  one can picture the little household guard running the old culverins  and sakers into position on the battlements.    The great mullioned window beneath the Tudor arch and over the entrance  gate belongs to the \"King's room,\" a fine old tapestried chamber  containing the bed, with green and gold hangings, where Henry VII.  slept; and it is no difficult matter to repeople it in the imagination  with the inhabitants of that time in their picturesque costumes. There  is a richness in the colouring of the faded tapestry and hangings in  contrast with the red-brick Tudor fireplace far more striking than if  the restorer had been allowed a liberal hand. It is like a bit of  Haddon, and such rooms are as rarely met with nowadays as unrestored  churches. The remarkable hiding-place at Oxburgh we have described in  detail elsewhere.[14] It is situated in the little projecting turret of  the eastern tower, and is so cleverly constructed beneath the solid  brick floor, that no one would believe until they saw the solid masonry  move upwards that there was sufficient space beneath to conceal a man.  The Bedingfields are an old Roman Catholic family, and it is usually in  the mansions of those of that faith that these ingenious contrivances  are to be seen.    A priest's hole was discovered quite recently in Snowre Hall, a curious  Tudor house some ten miles to the west of Oxburgh. It is entered through  a shaft from the roof, and measures five feet by six feet and four feet  high, and beneath it is an inner and smaller hiding-place. Mr. Pratt (in  whose family the house has been for two centuries) when he made the  discovery had to remove four barrow-loads of jackdaws' nests. The  discovery of this secret room is an interesting sequel to the fact that  on April 29, 1646, Charles I. slept at Snowre Hall. It will be  remembered that before he delivered himself up to the Scots army, he  spent some days wandering about the eastern counties in disguise, like  his son did in the western counties five years later. The owner of the  house in those days was a Mr. Ralph Skipwith, who, to put the spies that  were lurking about the vicinity off the track, provided the king with  his own grey riding-jacket in place of the clergyman's black coat he was  wearing, for that disguise had been widely advertised by his enemies.  Dr. Hudson, who was acting as scout, joined Charles and his companion,  Mr. Ashburnham, at Downham Market, where the \"King's Walk\" by the town  side, where they met, may still be seen. It is recorded by Dr. Stukeley  that Charles scratched some motto or secret instructions to his friends  on a pane of glass in the Swan Inn, where he put up awaiting Hudson's  return from Southwell. The fugitives proceeded thence to the Cherry Inn  at Mundford, some fourteen miles from Downham, and back to Crimplesham,  where they halted at an inn to effect the disguise above referred to.  The regicide Miles Corbet, who was on the track with Valentine Walton,  gave information as follows:    \"Since our coming to Lyn we have done what service we were able. We have  taken some examinations, and it doth appeare to us that Mr. Hudson, the  parson that came from Oxford with the king, was at Downham in Norfolk  with two other gentlemen upon Thursday the last of April. We cannot yet  learn where they were Friday night; but Saturday morning, the 2 of May  they came to a blind alehouse at Crimplesham, about 8 miles from Lyn.  From thence Mr. Hudson did ride on Saturday to Downham again, and there  two soldiers met with him, and had private speech with him. Hudson was  then in a scarlet coat. Ther he met with Mr. Ralf Skipwith of his former  acquaintance, and with him he did exchange his horse; and Skipwith and  the said Hudson did ride to Southrie ferrie a privat way to go towards  Ely; and went by the way to Crimplesham, and ther were the other  two--one in a parsons habit, which by all description was the king.  Hudson procured the said Skipwith to get a gray coat for the Dr. (as he  called the king), which he did. And ther the king put off his black coat  and long cassock, and put on Mr. Skipwith his gray coat. The king bought  a new hat at Downham, and on Saturday went into the Isle of Ely.  Wherever they came they were very private and always writing. Hudson  tore some papers when they came out of the house. Hudson did enquire for  a ship to go to the north or Newcastel, but could get none. We hear at  the same time there were 6 soldiers and officers as is thought at  Oxborough at another blind alehouse.\"[15]    It is worthy of remark that Miles Corbet, whom Pepys saw on the morning  of April 19, 1662, looking \"very cheerful\" upon his way to Tyburn, was a  native of Norfolk, and his monument may be seen in Sprowston Church near  Norwich.    The \"Swan\" at Downham still exists, but it was modernised some fifteen  years ago. It would be interesting to know what became of the historical  pane of glass.

NOOKS IN WARWICKSHIRE AND  BORDERLAND      The outline of Warwickshire is something in the form of a turnip, and  the stem of it, which, like an isthmus, projects into Gloucestershire  and Oxfordshire, contains many old-world places.    Long Compton, the most southern village of all, is grey and straggling  and picturesque, with orchards on all sides, and a fine old church, amid  a group of thatched cottages, whose interior was restored or mangled at  a period when these things were not done with much antiquarian taste. We  have pleasant recollections of a sojourn at the \"Old Red Lion,\" where  mine host in 1880, a typical Warwickshire farmer, was the most  hospitable and cheery to be found in this or any other county: an  innkeeper of the old school that it did one's heart good to see.    But this welcome house of call is by no means the only Lion of the  neighbourhood, for on the ridge of the high land which forms the  boundary of Oxfordshire are the \"Whispering Knights,\" the \"King's  Stone,\" and a weird Druidical circle. These are the famous Rollright  Stones, about which there is a story that a Danish prince came over to  invade England, and when at Dover he consulted the oracle as to the  chances of success. He was told that      \"When Long Compton you shall see,    You shall King of England be.\"    Naturally he and his soldiers made a bee-line for Long Compton, and,  arriving at the spot where the circle is now marked by huge boulders, he  was so elated that he stepped in advance of his followers, who stood  round him, saying, \"It is not meet that I should remain among my  subjects, I will go before.\" But for his conceit some unkind spirit  turned the whole party into stone, which doesn't seem quite fair.  \"King's Stone\" stands conspicuous from the rest on the other side of the  road, and, being very erect, looks as if the prince still prided himself  upon his folly. The diameter of the circle is over a hundred feet. In an  adjoining field is a cluster of five great stones. These are the  \"Whispering Knights\"; and the secret among themselves is that they will  not consent to budge an inch, and woe to the farmer who attempts to  remove them. The story goes that one of the five was once carted off to  make a bridge; but the offender had such a warm time of it that he  speedily repented his folly and reinstated it.    There is a delightful walk across the fields from Long Compton to Little  Compton, with a glorious prospect of the Gloucestershire and  Warwickshire hills. This village used to be in the former county, but  now belongs to Warwickshire. Close to the quaint saddle-back towered  church stands the gabled Elizabethan manor-house, with the Juxon arms  carved over the entrance. Its exterior has been but little altered since  the prelate lived here in retirement after the execution of Charles I. A  gruesome relic was kept in one of the rooms, the block upon which the  poor monarch's head was severed. This and King Charles' chair and some  of the archbishop's treasured books disappeared from the manor-house  after the death of his descendant Lady Fane. Internally the house has  been much altered, but there are many nooks and corners to carry the  memory back to the hunting bishop, for his pack of hounds was one of the  best managed in the country. Upon one occasion a complaint was made to  the Lord Protector that Juxon's hounds had followed the scent through  Chipping Norton churchyard at the time of a puritanical assembly there.  But Oliver would hear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#9)"],[1,"\"    9 The Lord said again to Adam, \"O Adam, when you were in the garden,  these trials did not come to you.    10 But since you transgressed My commandment, all these sufferings have  come over you.    11 Now, also, does your flesh require food and drink; drink then of  that water that flows by you on the face of the earth.    12 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.    13 And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned from the river of  water to the cave.  It was noon-day; and when they drew near to the  cave, they saw a large fire by it.      * This phrase indicates that the bleeding will take place in an  elevated position above the populace.  This is believed to be a  reference to the cross whereby Christ bled profusely above the people  below.    ** Golgotha (goal-goth-uh) was the hill outside the walls of Jerusalem  where Jesus was crucified. Its exact location is not precisely known,  but the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is believed to have been  constructed on this hill.    *** Reference: John 6:25 and 7:38          Chapter XLIII - The Devil attempts arson.    1 Then Adam and Eve were afraid, and stood still.  And Adam said to  Eve, \"What is that fire by our cave?  We have done nothing in it to  cause this fire.    2 We neither have bread to bake therein, nor broth to cook there.  As  to this fire, we have never known anything like it, neither do we know  what to call it.    3 But ever since God sent the cherub with a sword of fire that flashed  and lightened in his hand, from fear of which we fell down and were  like corpses, have we not seen the like.    4 But now, O Eve, behold, this is the same fire that was in the  cherub's hand, which God has sent to keep the cave in which we live.    5 O Eve, it is because God is angry with us, and will drive us from it.    6 O Eve, we have again transgressed His commandment in that cave, so  that He had sent this fire to burn around it, and to prevent us from  going into it.    7 If this be really so, O Eve, where shall we live?  And where shall we  flee from before the face of the Lord?  Since, in regards to the  garden, He will not let us live in it, and He has deprived us of the  good things thereof; but He has placed us in this cave, in which we  have borne darkness, trials and hardships, until at last we have found  comfort therein.    8 But now that He has brought us out into another land, who knows what  may happen in it?  And who knows but that the darkness of that land may  be far greater than the darkness of this land?    9 Who knows what may happen in that land by day or by night? And who  knows whether it will be far or near, O Eve?  Where it will please God  to put us, may be far from the garden, O Eve?  Or where God will  prevent us from beholding Him, because we have transgressed His  commandment, and because we have made requests of Him at all times?    10 O Eve, if God will bring us into a strange land other than this, in  which we find consolation, it must be to put our souls to death, and  blot out our name from the face of the earth.    11 O Eve, if we are further alienated from the garden and from God,  where shall we find Him again, and ask Him to give us gold, incense,  myrrh, and some fruit of the fig-tree?    12 Where shall we find Him, to comfort us a second time?  Where shall  we find Him, that He may think of us, as regards the covenant He has  made on our behalf?\"    13 Then Adam said no more. And they kept looking, He and Eve, towards  the cave, and at the fire that flared up around it.    14 But that fire was from Satan.  For he had gathered trees and dry  grasses, and had carried and brought them to the cave, and had set fire  to them, in order to consume the cave and what was in it.    15 So that Adam and Eve should be left in sorrow, and he should cut off  their trust in God, and make them deny Him.    16 But by the mercy of God he could not burn the cave, for God sent His  angel around the cave to guard it from such a fire, until it went out.    17 And this fire lasted from noon-day until the break of day.  That was  the forty-fifth day.          Chapter XLIV - The power of fire over man.    1 Yet Adam and Eve were standing and looking at the fire, and unable to  come near the cave from their dread of the fire.    2 And Satan kept on bringing trees and throwing them into the fire,  until the flames of the fire rose up on high, and covered the whole  cave, thinking, as he did in his own mind, to consume the cave with  much fire.  But the angel of the Lord was guarding it.    3 And yet he could not curse Satan, nor injure him by word, because he  had no authority over him, neither did he take to doing so with words  from his mouth.    4 Therefore the angel tolerated him, without saying one bad word, until  the Word of God came who said to Satan, \"Go away from here; once before  you deceived My servants, and this time you seek to destroy them.    5 Were it not for My mercy I would have destroyed you and your hosts  from off the earth. But I have had patience with you, until the end of  the world.\"    6 Then Satan fled from before the Lord.  But the fire went on burning  around the cave like a coal-fire the whole day; which was the  forty-sixth day Adam and Eve had spent since they came out of the  garden.    7 And when Adam and Eve saw that the heat of the fire had somewhat  cooled down, they began to walk towards the cave to get into it as they  usually did; but they could not, by reason of the heat of the fire.    8 Then they both began crying because of the fire that separated them  from the cave, and that came towards them, burning.  And they were  afraid.    9 Then Adam said to Eve, \"See this fire of which we have a portion in  us:  which formerly yielded to us, but no longer does so, now that we  have transgressed the limit of creation, and changed our condition, and  our nature is altered.  But the fire is not changed in its nature, nor  altered from its creation.  Therefore it now has power over us; and  when we come near it, it scorches our flesh.\"          Chapter XLV - Why Satan didn't fulfil his promises.  Description of  hell.    1 Then Adam rose and prayed to God, saying, \"See, this fire has  separated us from the cave in which You have commanded us to live; but  now, behold, we cannot go into it.\"    2 Then God heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said:--    3 \"O Adam, see this fire!  How different the flame and heat thereof are  from the garden of delights and the good things in it!    4 When you were under My control, all creatures yielded to you; but  after you have transgressed My commandment, they all rise over you.\"    5 God said again to him, \"See, O Adam, how Satan has exalted you!  He  has deprived you of the Godhead, and of an exalted state like Me, and  has not kept his word to you; but has, after all, become your enemy.  He is the one who made this fire in which he meant to burn you and Eve.    6 Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with you, not even one  day; but has deprived you of the glory that was on you--when you  yielded to his command?    7 Do you think, Adam, that he loved you when he made this agreement  with you?  Or that he loved you and wished to raise you on high?    8 But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to you; but he  wished to make you come out of light into darkness; and from an exalted  state to degradation; from glory to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and  from rest to fasting and fainting.\"    9 God also said to Adam, \"See this fire kindled by Satan around your  cave; see this wonder that surrounds you; and know that it will  encompass about both you and your descendants, when you obey his  command; that he will plague you with fire; and that you will go down  into hell after you are dead.    10 Then you will see the burning of his fire, that will be burning  around you and likewise your descendants.  You will not be delivered  from it until My coming; just like you cannot go into your cave right  now because of the great fire around it; not until My Word comes and  makes a way for you on the day My covenant is fulfilled.    11 There is no way for you at present to come from this life to rest,  not until My Word comes, who is My Word.  Then He will make a way for  you, and you shall have rest.\" Then God called with His Word to the  fire that burned around the cave, that it split itself in half, until  Adam had gone through it.  Then the fire parted itself by God's order,  and a way was made for Adam*.    12 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.      * Reference: Exodus 14:21,22 and Joshua 3:15-17          Chapter XLVI - \"How many times have I delivered you out of his hand . .  .\"    1 Then Adam and Eve began again to come into the cave.  And when they  came to the way between the fire, Satan blew into the fire like a  whirlwind, and caused the burning coal-fire to cover Adam and Eve; so  that their bodies were singed; and the coal-fire scorched them*.    2 And from the burning of the fire Adam and Eve screamed, and said, \"O  Lord, save us!  Leave us not to be consumed and plagued by this burning  fire; neither require us for having transgressed Your commandment.\"    3 Then God looked at their bodies, on which Satan had caused fire to  burn, and God sent His angel that stayed the burning fire.  But the  wounds remained on their bodies.    4 And God said to Adam, \"See Satan's love for you, who pretended to  give you the Godhead and greatness; and, behold, he burns you with  fire, and seeks to destroy you from off the earth.    5 Then look at Me, O Adam; I created you, and how many times have I  delivered you out of his hand?  If not, wouldn't  he have destroyed  you?\"    6 God said again to Eve, \"What is that he promised you in the garden,  saying, 'As soon as you eat from the tree, your eyes will be opened,  and you shall become like gods, knowing good and evil.'  But look!  He  has burnt your bodies with fire, and has made you taste the taste of  fire,"]]]
