Should it be gone, look carefully around the place;  sometimes you will see the feather 10 or 20 feet from the place you  have placed the pill, and there or elsewhere you should see a place  where the fox has been digging a hole. Examine the hole carefully and  you may find the poison, as often when not hungry he will hide it for  some other time, or for his friend. If you have reason to believe  that a fox took the pill, and owing to stormy weather you cannot find  him, you must survey the grounds as soon as the snow commences to  melt, and by looking carefully along the fences you will often find  them. Always keep trace of your pills; the best places to put these  is in the middle of a lake or field; the black feather will attract  the attention of the foxes at once, and they will make immediately  for any black spots they see in a field or on a lake.    To shoot them in winter: Get a complete suit made of white cotton,  including cap, smear your suit with scent, or have some balls of  cotton wool smeared with it and tie these around your belt with a  good string in such a way that you can remove them at will. In a fine  moonlight, take your snow shoes and go where the foxes are traveling,  and the moment you see one or hear one bark, circle around him so  that the wind will carry the scent. He will come towards you and will  stop at a certain distance from you, and as you notice him on the  alert, stop moving. The fox will put his head up and will look in all  directions in order to locate where the nest of the plump mice are,  and as you notice this sound the squeal of the field mouse; the fox  will at once run toward you; then shoot him. I use BB shot for foxes.    Where foxes are plentiful, a hunter of some experience can bag  several in three or four hours. I have killed as many as four in  three hours. A good wind, fine moonlight, and lots of foxes, a fellow  will have fine sport. In shooting foxes, keep as much as possible on  the small hills so as to survey more land. While I was living in the  country I had good sport shooting them in the spring, in the high  snow banks along the fences.    Foxes are fond of playing at such places, especially when there is a  crust to carry them. This generally comes in Canada at the latter end  of February and during the month of March. I have often killed them  at bait. Horse meat is fine bait for them. I once killed two big  foxes at one shot. A hunter can always approach a fox when he is  feeding, providing he knows how.    When I trap fox I do it on a large scale. I always set a combination  of traps and snares. I carry a good supply of wire snares. The twine  must be of dark color. In making a trail for fox, I take advantage of  every good place I find either for trap or snares, either between  bunches of weeds, trees, stones, stumps, roots, logs, fences, etc.,  where Mr. Fox will have to pass to follow my trail. On the rail or  other board fences I use the twine snare, and on a barbed wire fence,  the wire snare. In setting a twine snare, I always use a drop log or  stone, and so fixed that as soon as the fox pulls the weight drops,  and he is lifted and hung at once. I use ordinary wire fence staples  and two to each set, one placed so that when the weight falls the  neck of the fox is carried close to the staple and held there, and  the other staple close to the drop. The drop must be placed so that  it cannot reach the ground, and must weigh about three times as much  as any fox.    Any fox that puts his head in the loop is sure to stay there. In the  bush, I take advantage of all shanty roads, and I use spring poles  when I find a suitable tree. I just trim the head and use a wire  snare so that the squirrels, etc., will not bother it.    I set traps at the baits and in the middle of the fields in the same  way as poison, with bits of liver around it, and I cover the trap  with a light coat of snow with the same little shovel, and under the  pan I place some cotton wool with a few drops of scent, and should,  while the fox is picking up the pieces of liver, not step on the  trap, he is sure to scratch for the mouse under the pan, and the trap  will mouse him.        CHAPTER XII.    MY FIRST FOX.    I presume that almost every boy trapper in North America has an  ardent wish to trap one of these cunning sharp witted animals, and I  remember I thought when a boy if I could only catch a fox in a trap  my reputation as a trapper would be made, says F. W. Howard, of  Wisconsin.    Boys, you must not be discouraged if, after following the methods you  hear, you fail to take a fox, for probably most of you have only  traps enough to make one set; any of us older trappers I think will  admit that it is rather a difficult feat to make one set and take a  fox in a reasonably short time. Most of the trappers who use these  sets have likely from a dozen to fifty traps out for fox at one time.    I have sometimes taken foxes in traps set for skunk, coon and mink,  so that one may say that with a large number of traps out, even  though not set with the care and precautions usually taken to catch a  fox, the large number of chances open enable one to take here and  there a blundering and unwary fellow. I trapped my first fox when  about twelve years old, by following a method given me by my  grandfather, who was, in his day, a famous New England fox hunter. He  was a very old man at that time, but when I expressed to him my  heart's desire, asking him how and where to set the trap (I had but  one suitable for fox) he told me to get my father to let me take the  oxen and plow, to make a couple of furrows in our back pasture.  Following his instructions I boiled the trap in weak lye and then  daubed it over with fresh cow manure. The back pasture spoken of was  a place where foxes traveled, and I presume that there was no week in  the year that at least two or three foxes did not cross there.      [Illustration: CAUGHT IN A NO 1.]    Now, this is a very important point, if you are making but one set  especially, be sure and find a location for the set near some den or  ledge where foxes live, or at some point where you know they are in  the habit of crossing. But to continue, under my aged instructor's  direction I plowed two furrows across the pasture in the form of an  X. \"Now,\" said he, \"any fox that comes along will get down and run in  the furrows. Set your traps where they cross, and I shouldn't wonder  if you found one up here some fine morning.\" I scooped out a shallow  hole of a size to hold the trap and clog, put a bunch of wool under  the pan so it would spring easily, and covered all slightly and  smoothly with dirt; Granddad then placed some lumps of dirt in such a  way that a fox would be apt to step over them into the trap, if  coming from any direction. He cautioned me in visiting the trap to  walk by it some distance away.    \"How long do you think it will be before we catch a fox?\", I asked.  \"Maybe not for a week, and maybe not at all, but I tell you boy, if  you want to catch a fox you have got to stick to it.\" You can imagine  my delight the next morning on finding a fine red fox tangled up  among some huckleberry bushes near by, and you may be sure I thought  Granddad the greatest trapper in the world, and myself the next.    I caught two more foxes at the same set before snow came, and will  say that I have always found this method one of the surest, but of  course very few boys are situated so as to have pastures that foxes  cross, and which they can plow furrows in.    Foxes are generally suspicious of a dead bait; however, at a bait  which they have been in the habit of visiting, generally some  carcass, they are more easily caught than at a freshly placed bait or  carcass, and it is a good plan, if you try taking a fox in this way,  to put out the carcass or large baits long enough in advance for them  to get into the practice of coming to them; then place your traps, if  possible, just before a fall of snow, and you are almost certain of  catching one. The traps should always be set with care and treated as  already described, to cover the scent of iron, as a fox considers the  scent of man and iron a dangerous combination, and they undoubtedly  know about traps and fear them.      [Illustration: CAUGHT ON HIS OWN FARM.]    I like to use a live bait for fox and bobcats, and a rabbit is about  the best for this purpose, because they are easily secured. They form  the principal game of these animals and they are nearly always  looking for them. It is, I think, safe to say, that each grown fox or  bobcat kill two hundred each on an average every year. The sight or  hot scent of any game these animals are accustomed to hunt excites  them, and their faculties are at once concentrated on how to capture  and get on the outside of said game as soon as possible. Under such  conditions, they fall more easy prey to trappers' wiles. Select a  point where you know foxes hunt, or not far from some den or ledge  which they use. Find a hollow log or some tree that has a hollow butt  with an opening; in either case, plug the hollow securely so the  rabbit will have to stay up near the opening, put in some carrots, or  ears of corn, and cover the hole with woven wire, having about an  inch mesh, or some barb wire stapled across will sometimes answer;  they may in some cases be afraid of the wire, but I have had  excellent success with this method, and my opinion is that the sight  of live game makes them reckless (on one occasion I caught a fox in a  wooden box about eight inches square and three or four feet long,  having a wire door, hinged at the top and slanting in,--a  self-setter--the trap had a live rabbit inside and was set along a creek,  for the purpose of taking a mink alive and uninjured).    If this method is used as a snow set, brush out all tracks, and  whether on snow or bare ground, always make as few tracks and leave  as little sign"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#9)"],[1,"tration: A FEW GOOD ONES.]    A meadow brook, not too large, with low, spongy banks, can be worked  to best advantage. Look the ground well over in advance, acquainting  yourself with the haunts of the game, and all the holes and other  places in which a mink is likely to take refuge when pursued. For an  outfit you need at least a crowbar and shovel (sometimes a sharp  pointed, hardwood stick can be made to answer for the former) and  each man should have a gun.    Go to the brook in the early morning, before the scent has had time  to cool. Allow the dog to hunt along the borders and under the banks,  and when he picks up a track, work along with him until he has the  game in hiding. You will find it necessary to assist him  considerably, as mink by no means always travel on land. When one  takes to the water, as they usually do at short intervals, the trail  is broken beyond the ability of the strongest nosed dog to follow at  such times as this, that is when Mr. Mink takes the brook for it, one  should go ahead with the dog and find where he resumed dry footing.  It will probably not be far, for he is in and out every few yards or  so, and if you go far without striking the trail you had better turn  back, for he is most likely hiding in the bank somewhere behind you.    After locating the hole where he is hiding, let the dog dig him out  while a man stands a little distance up and down the brook  respectively, with gun ready cocked for him when he comes along. If  the hole extends some distance back into the bank, the rear end may  usually be reached, after a few trials, by thrusting the bar down  from overhead, which will have the effect to send the hunted animal  forth in a hurry. Often, however, the spade will have to be brought  into requisition and used freely before the object is accomplished.    At first he will probably forsake one hole only to take refuge in  another, but when he finds that you are really after him, and that  there is, moreover, a dog in the racket, he will try the dodge of  swimming under water. Then is your time. Watch for him at the shallow  places, where he will prove an easy mark. Have guns loaded light and  aim to have charge strike a little to one side of body. The  concussion will be sufficient to stop him, and the fur will not be  injured as in firing point blank. It is exciting sport for the mink  is like \"greased lightning\" in his movements, and if given the least  chance will outwit both dog and man and escape.    An old New Hampshire gunner told us that he and his partner once got  sixteen mink this way in one week, the best of which brought them  twelve to fifteen dollars a skin. He knew absolutely nothing about  trapping so resorted to this method instead. We have mentioned spade,  bar and guns as comprising the necessary outfit, but of course various  other implements of one's own invention and manufacture can often be  used to advantage. Some make great account of a piece of wire with a  sharp hook at one end for thrusting into the hole and drawing the  mink to the light, as a trout from the water. Others use a long  handled spear to thrust under banks, or to pinion the game when going  through shallows. A truly barbarous practice besides the further  objections of greatly damaging the pelt of the animals taken thus.      [Illustration: BROKE THE FASTENING.]    Another mode of capturing the mink is to lie about the streams on wet  and foggy days and shoot him. They travel a great deal in such  weather. By selecting a spot where you can keep well hidden, yet  commanding a long stretch of beach under some overhanging bank, you  stand a good chance to secure a shot if you have plenty of patience.  Of course you would not be apt to get many in a day, but one mink  represents a pretty good day's work at the price they are selling  now.    One characteristic of the animal should be borne in mind when  pursuing this method of hunting him, and that is his persistency in  going whichever way he wishes to go. If a mink starts to go up a  brook he's going up before he gets through with it, or lose his life  trying; and down the same. The more anybody or anything tries to  prevent him, the more desperate and reckless he grows in his efforts  to accomplish his aim. So if one sees you and turns back startled  don't follow him, but just crouch down in a convenient hiding place  and wait for him. The chances are ninety to one that he will soon be  back again.    I have known trappers to have good success taking mink with a common  box trap such as is used in catching rats about the house and barn,  and I am inclined to think that aside from its bulkiness this is a  pretty good sort of trap. Some use poison as for the wolf, but the  use of this on animals was always repugnant to me.    Perhaps the queerest method of which I ever heard was that mentioned  by a gentleman in Illinois. He claimed to have caught mink with an  ordinary fish hook, baited, and attached to a piece of wire.    I do not believe, however, that any of the methods mentioned in this  article are equal for effectiveness and true sport to the regular way  with steel trap or deadfall. Some of them, it seems to me, I could  not be induced to make use of on any account. And yet, as already  stated, one might find himself in circumstances that would justify  their adoption.        CHAPTER XII.    ILLINOIS TRAPPER'S METHOD.    I for one will say that the mink is a very shy animal, but I do claim  he can be caught if you study him and set your trap in the right  place. I will suppose that you are trapping along a small stream. All  you need is plenty of traps, a belt with a small hatchet attached, a  small caliber pistol, and a pair of hip rubber boots. A pair of these  boots are as necessary in a trapper's outfit as the main spring is in  the watch or clock. Be sure to have your traps in good working order.    Oh yes, I forgot the scent. This you can make yourself by cutting up  a couple of cats and muskrats in fine pieces and let them rot good,  then add some fish oil and four or five different kinds of oil that  you can buy at a drug store. To make this scent all the better you  had better put in about one-half pound of limburger cheese. Now then  you got her to smelling just right, and every mink that gets a whiff  of this perfume will say, oh joy, and hike off in the other direction  as fast as his legs can carry him. I took a little bottle of this  great scent with me once on a trapping trip. I carried it in my coat  pocket. I was leaning over some roots setting a trap when the cork  came out of the bottle--well, you know the rest. I never need to hunt  for this coat when I want to put it on, for it always makes itself  known.    You are now ready to set your traps. You might take a couple of dogs  and several small boys to help track up the ground. This the mink can  see and smell, and it makes them easier to catch. Now then with your  traps on your back, get down into the water, and be careful when  going in and out of the water and not make tracks in mud and on side  of bank.    The place to set your trap is on the edge of the water. Walk along in  the water and examine every hole just even with the water's edge.  Some of the holes may come out several inches under water. Set your  trap here in water 2 1/2 inches deep, turn spring to right and cover  trap with a muddy leaf, fasten trap with a stick run through ring,  and have chain stretched out in deep water as far as it will reach.  You will see that you haven't touched a thing but your trap and  stake. As for the trap, the running water will clean it of any scent  you may have left on by handling, but the stake I splash with water  and wash a little. If in setting the trap you touch or step on the  bank, wash out your tracks with water.    Now then move on, and if you come to a tree on the bank that has lots  of roots just even with the water, examine it close, for here is a  good place for a mink den. If you find a hole set your trap as  before, being careful to leave things as they were. A place where the  bank guides the mink into the water is a good set. If you set a trap  and have reason to think that the mink will walk around it, then  stick up small sticks and little bushes so as to make a fence to  guide your mink into the trap. A mink is not afraid of it, for he  sees bushes in the water, and it will not scare him a bit.    The way just spoken of, of sticking sticks across the water, is a  very important way to catch mink, and I advise all trappers to give  it a little more thought. If you trap along a ditch or very small  stream just try it. Stick your sticks across the stream just like a  little fence, leaving three gaps, one at each end and one in the  middle. Set your three traps in here, and I bet you will get nearly  every mink that goes up that stream. Of course, stand in the water  while you are doing all of this, and your success will be doubly  better.    When you put out a line of traps where there are mink, hide every  trap as carefully as you can. Suppose you set a trap uncovered at  what you suppose to be a muskrat hole, you don't know but what some  mink might come along, and on entering the hole he sees the  trap--well, it don't take him long to leave the place. Then boys, the  very next hole that mink goes into he will look for another trap. You  don't need to fool a mink very often until he becomes educated, and  then catch him if you can.      [Illustration: TRAPPING DOWN STREAM.]    To catch mink successfully you must have open water. I very seldom  set for mink when water is all frozen up. Did you ever notice that  you made your best catch of mink on a snowy or rainy night? Now, why  is this? It is because your tracks and scent were either washed out  or covered up by snow. A mink is not a hard animal to catch if you  have water and weather just right, and you are careful about setting  your trap. But he is a very shy animal, "]]]
