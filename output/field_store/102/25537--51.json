The bird had no opportunity to see the road along which it was  carried, or to get the general direction, except at the time of  starting, when the boy carried him a few rods openly.    He was placed with the ducks in a spring run, under a tree in a  secluded place on the river slope, about a hundred yards from the  highway. The two ducks treated him very contemptuously. It was easy to  see that the drake was homesick from the first hour, and he soon left  the presence of the scornful ducks.    Then we shut the three in the barn together, and kept them there a  day and a night. Still the friendship did not ripen; the ducks and the  drake separated the moment we let them out. Left to himself, the drake  at once turned his head homeward, and started up the hill for the  highway.    Then we shut the trio up together again for a couple of days, but with  the same results as before. There seemed to be but one thought in the  mind of the drake, and that was home.    Several times we headed him off and brought him back, till finally on  the third or fourth day I said to my son, \"If that drake is really  bound to go home, he shall have an opportunity to make the trial, and  I will go with him to see that he has fair play.\" We withdrew, and the  homesick mallard started up through the currant patch, then through  the vineyard toward the highway which he had never seen.    When he reached the fence, he followed it south till he came to the  open gate, where he took to the road as confidently as if he knew for  a certainty that it would lead him straight to his mate. How eagerly  he paddled along, glancing right and left, and increasing his speed at  every step! I kept about fifty yards behind him. Presently he met a  dog; he paused and eyed the animal for a moment, and then turned to  the right along a road which diverged just at that point, and which  led to the railroad station. I followed, thinking the drake would soon  lose his bearings, and get hopelessly confused in the tangle of roads  that converged at the station.    But he seemed to have an exact map of the country in his mind; he soon  left the station road, went around a house, through a vineyard, till  he struck a stone fence that crossed his course at right angles; this  he followed eastward till it was joined by a barbed wire fence, under  which he passed and again entered the highway he had first taken. Then  down the road he paddled with renewed confidence: under the trees,  down a hill, through a grove, over a bridge, up the hill again toward  home.    Presently he found his clue cut in two by the railroad track; this was  something he had never before seen; he paused, glanced up it, then  down it, then at the highway across it, and quickly concluded this  last was his course. On he went again, faster and faster.    He had now gone half the distance, and was getting tired. A little  pool of water by the roadside caught his eye. Into it he plunged,  bathed, drank, preened his plumage for a few moments, and then started  homeward again. He knew his home was on the upper side of the road,  for he kept his eye bent in that direction, scanning the fields. Twice  he stopped, stretched himself up, and scanned the landscape intently;  then on again. It seemed as if an invisible cord was attached to him,  and he was being pulled down the road.    Just opposite a farm lane which led up to a group of farm buildings,  and which did indeed look like his home lane, he paused and seemed to  be debating with himself. Two women just then came along; they lifted  and flirted their skirts, for it was raining, and this disturbed him  again and decided him to take to the farm lane. Up the lane he went,  rather doubtingly, I thought.    In a few moments it brought him into a barn-yard, where a group of hens  caught his eye. Evidently he was on good terms with hens at home, for  he made up to these eagerly as if to tell them his troubles; but the  hens knew not ducks; they withdrew suspiciously, then assumed a  threatening attitude, till one old \"dominic\" put up her feathers and  charged upon him viciously.    Again he tried to make up to them, quacking softly, and again he was  repulsed. Then the cattle in the yard spied this strange creature and  came sniffing toward it, full of curiosity.    The drake quickly concluded he had got into the wrong place, and  turned his face southward again. Through the fence he went into a  plowed field. Presently another stone fence crossed his path; along  this he again turned toward the highway. In a few minutes he found  himself in a corner formed by the meeting of two stone fences. Then he  turned appealingly to me, uttering the soft note of the mallard. To  use his wings never seemed to cross his mind.    Well, I am bound to confess that I helped the drake over the wall, but  I sat him down in the road as impartially as I could. How well his  pink feet knew the course! How they flew up the road! His green head  and white throat fairly twinkled under the long avenue of oaks and  chestnuts.    At last we came in sight of the home lane, which led up to the  farmhouse one hundred or more yards from the road. I was curious to  see if he would recognize the place. At the gate leading into the lane  he paused. He had just gone up a lane that looked like that and had  been disappointed. What should he do now? Truth compels me to say that  he overshot the mark: he kept on hesitatingly along the highway.    It was now nearly night. I felt sure the duck would soon discover his  mistake, but I had not time to watch the experiment further. I went  around the drake and turned him back. As he neared the lane this time  he seemed suddenly to see some familiar landmark, and he rushed up it  at the top of his speed. His joy and eagerness were almost pathetic.    I followed close. Into the house yard he rushed with uplifted wings,  and fell down almost exhausted by the side of his mate. A half hour  later the two were nipping the grass together in the pasture, and he,  I have no doubt, was eagerly telling her the story of his adventures.                                             V                            FACTORS IN ANIMAL LIFE      The question that the Californian schoolchildren put to me, \"Have the  birds got sense?\" still \"sticks in my crop.\"    Such extraordinary sense has been attributed to most of the wild  creatures by several of our latter day nature-writers, that I have  been moved to examine the whole question more thoroughly than ever  before, and to find out, as far as I can, just how much and what kind  of sense the birds and four-footed beasts have.    In this and in some following chapters I shall make an effort to use  my own sense to the best advantage in probing that of the animals,  which has, as I think, been so vastly overrated.    When sentiment gets overripe, it becomes sentimentalism. The sentiment  for nature which has been so assiduously cultivated in our times is  fast undergoing this change, and is softening into sentimentalism  toward the lower animals. Many a wholesome feeling can be pushed so  far that it becomes a weakness and a sign of disease. Pity for the  sufferings of our brute neighbors may be a manly feeling; and then  again it may be so fostered and cosseted that it becomes maudlin and  unworthy. When hospitals are founded for sick or homeless cats and  dogs, when all forms of vivisection are cried down, when the animals  are humanized and books are written to show that the wild creatures  have schools and kindergartens, and that their young are instructed  and disciplined in quite the human way by their fond parents; when we  want to believe that reason and not instinct guides them, that they  are quite up in some of the simpler arts of surgery, mending or  amputating their own broken limbs and salving their wounds,--when, I  say, our attitude toward the natural life about us and our feeling for  it have reached the stage implied by these things, then has sentiment  degenerated into sentimentalism, and our appreciation of nature lost  its firm edge.    No doubt there is a considerable number of people in any community  that are greatly taken with this improved anthropomorphic view of wild  nature now current among us. Such a view tickles the fancy and touches  the emotions. It makes the wild creatures so much more interesting.  Shall we deny anything to a bird or beast that makes it more  interesting, and more worthy of our study and admiration?    This sentimental view of animal life has its good side and its bad  side. Its good side is its result in making us more considerate and  merciful toward our brute neighbors; its bad side is seen in the  degree to which it leads to a false interpretation of their lives. The  tendency to which I refer is no doubt partly the result of our growing  humanitarianism and feeling of kinship with all the lower orders of  creation, and partly due to the fact that we live in a time of  impromptu nature study, when birds and plants and trees are fast  becoming a fad with half the population, and when the \"yellow\"  reporter is abroad in the fields and woods. Never before in my time  have so many exaggerations and misconceptions of the wild life about  us been current in the popular mind. It is becoming the fashion to  ascribe to the lower animals nearly all our human motives and  attributes, and often to credit them with plans and devices that imply  reason and a fair amount of mechanical knowledge. An illustration of  this is the account of the nest of a pair of orioles, as described in  the \"North American Review\" for May, 1903, by a writer of popular  nature books. These orioles built a nest so extraordinary that it can  be accounted for only on the theory that there _is_ a school of the  woods, and that these two birds had been pupils there and had taken an  advanced course in Strings. Among other things impossible for birds to  do, these orioles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#9)"],[1,"ea, and with a sword pick the buttons from a waistcoat, forgot the  twenty good years still before him; forgot that men loved him for the  mistakes he had made; that in parts of the great city of Paris his name  was still spoken fondly, still was famous and familiar.    In his book on the \"Ethics of Suicide,\" for certain hard places in life  he had laid down an inevitable rule of conduct.    As he saw it he had come to one of those hard places, and he would not  ask of others what he himself would not perform.    From Mexico he set out for California, but not to the house his wife had  prepared for him.    Instead, on February 9, 1898, at El Paso, he left the train and  registered at a hotel.    At 7.30 in the evening he went to his room, and when, on the following  morning, they kicked in the door, they found him stretched rigidly upon  the bed, like one lying in state, with, near his hand, a half-emptied  bottle of poison.    On a chair was pinned this letter to his wife:    \"My DEAREST,--No news from you, although you have had plenty of time to  write. Harvey has written me that he has no one in view at present to  buy my land. Well, I shall have tasted the cup of bitterness to the very  dregs, but I do not complain. Good-by. I forgive you your conduct toward  me and trust you will be able to forgive yourself. I prefer to be a dead  gentleman to a living blackguard like your father.\"      And when they searched his open trunk for something that might identify  the body on the bed, they found the crown of Trinidad.    You can imagine it: the mean hotel bedroom, the military figure with  its white face and mustache, \"_a la_ Louis Napoleon,\" at rest upon the  pillow, the startled drummers and chambermaids peering in from the hall,  and the landlord, or coroner, or doctor, with a bewildered countenance,  lifting to view the royal crown of gilt and velvet.    The other actors in this, as Harold Frederic called it, \"Opera Bouffe  Monarchy,\" are still living.    The Baroness Harden-Hickey makes her home in this country.    The Count de la Boissiere, ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, is still a  leader of the French colony in New York, and a prosperous commission  merchant with a suite of offices on Fifty-fourth Street. By the will of  Harden-Hickey he is executor of his estate, guardian of his children,  and what, for the purpose of this article, is of more importance, in  his hands lies the future of the kingdom of Trinidad. When Harden-Hickey  killed himself the title to the island was in dispute. Should young  Harden-Hickey wish to claim it, it still would be in dispute. Meanwhile,  by the will of the First James, De la Boissiere is appointed perpetual  regent, a sort of \"receiver,\" and executor of the principality.    To him has been left a royal decree signed and sealed, but blank. In the  will the power to fill in this blank with a statement showing the final  disposition of the island has been bestowed upon De la Boissiere.    So, some day, he may proclaim the accession of a new king, and give a  new lease of life to the kingdom of which Harden-Hickey dreamed.    But unless his son, or wife, or daughter should assert his or her  rights, which is not likely to happen, so ends the dynasty of James the  First of Trinidad, Baron of the Holy Roman Empire.    To the wise ones in America he was a fool, and they laughed at him; to  the wiser ones, he was a clever rascal who had evolved a new real-estate  scheme and was out to rob the people--and they respected him. To my  mind, of them all, Harden-Hickey was the wisest.    Granted one could be serious, what could be more delightful than to be  your own king on your own island?    The comic paragraphers, the business men of \"hard, common sense,\" the  captains of industry who laughed at him and his national resources  of buried treasure, turtles' eggs, and guano, with his body-guard of  Zouaves and his Grand Cross of Trinidad, certainly possessed many things  that Harden-Hickey lacked. But they in turn lacked the things that made  him happy; the power to \"make believe,\" the love of romance, the touch  of adventure that plucked him by the sleeve.    When, as boys, we used to say: \"Let's pretend we're pirates,\" as a man,  Harden-Hickey begged: \"Let's pretend I'm a king.\"    But the trouble was, the other boys had grown up and would not pretend.    For some reason his end always reminds me of the closing line of  Pinero's play, when the adventuress, Mrs. Tanqueray, kills herself, and  her virtuous stepchild says: \"If we had only been kinder!\"          WINSTON SPENCER CHURCHILL    IN the strict sense of the phrase, a soldier of fortune is a man who for  pay, or for the love of adventure, fights under the flag of any country.    In the bigger sense he is the kind of man who in any walk of life makes  his own fortune, who, when he sees it coming, leaps to meet it, and  turns it to his advantage.    Than Winston Spencer Churchill to-day there are few young men--and he is  a very young man--who have met more varying fortunes, and none who has  more frequently bent them to his own advancement. To him it has been  indifferent whether, at the moment, the fortune seemed good or evil, in  the end always it was good.    As a boy officer, when other subalterns were playing polo, and at the  Gaiety Theatre attending night school, he ran away to Cuba and fought  with the Spaniards. For such a breach of military discipline, any other  officer would have been court-martialled. Even his friends feared that  by his foolishness his career in the army was at an end. Instead, his  escapade was made a question in the House of Commons, and the fact  brought him such publicity that the _Daily Graphic_ paid him handsomely  to write on the Cuban Revolution, and the Spanish Government rewarded  him with the Order of Military Merit.    At the very outbreak of the Boer war he was taken prisoner. It seemed  a climax of misfortune. With his brother officers he had hoped in that  campaign to acquit himself with credit, and that he should lie inactive  in Pretoria appeared a terrible calamity. To the others who, through  many heart-breaking months, suffered imprisonment, it continued to be  a calamity. But within six weeks of his capture Churchill escaped, and,  after many adventures, rejoined his own army to find that the calamity  had made him a hero.    When after the battle of Omdurman, in his book on \"The River War,\" he  attacked Lord Kitchener, those who did not like him, and they were many,  said: \"That's the end of Winston in the army. He'll never get another  chance to criticise K. of K.\"    But only two years later the chance came, when, no longer a subaltern,  but as a member of the House of Commons, he patronized Kitchener by  defending him from the attacks of others.    Later, when his assaults upon the leaders of his own party closed to  him, even in his own constituency, the Conservative debating clubs,  again his ill-wishers said: \"This _is_ the end. He has ridiculed those  who sit in high places. He has offended his cousin and patron, the Duke  of Marlborough. Without political friends, without the influence and  money of the Marlborough family he is a political nonentity.\" That was  eighteen months ago. To-day, at the age of thirty-two, he is one of the  leaders of the Government party, Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and  with the Liberals the most popular young man in public life.    Only last Christmas, at a banquet, Sir Edward Grey, the new Foreign  Secretary, said of him: \"Mr. Winston Churchill has achieved distinction  in at least five different careers--as a soldier, a war correspondent,  a lecturer, an author, and last, but not least, as a politician. I  have understated it even now, for he has achieved two careers as a  politician--one on each side of the House. His first career on the  Government side was a really distinguished career. I trust the second  will be even more distinguished--and more prolonged. The remarkable  thing is that he has done all this when, unless appearances very much  belie him, he has not reached the age of sixty-four, which is the  minimum age at which the politician ceases to be young.\"    Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born thirty-two years ago, in  November, 1874. By birth he is half-American. His father was Lord  Randolph Churchill, and his mother was Jennie Jerome, of New York.  On the father's side he is the grandchild of the seventh Duke of  Marlborough, on the distaff side, of Leonard Jerome.    To a student of heredity it would be interesting to try and discover  from which of these ancestors Churchill drew those qualities which in  him are most prominent, and which have led to his success.    What he owes to his father and mother it is difficult to overestimate,  almost as difficult as to overestimate what he has accomplished by his  own efforts.    He was not a child born a full-grown genius of commonplace parents.  Rather his fate threatened that he should always be known as the son  of his father. And certainly it was asking much of a boy that he should  live up to a father who was one of the most conspicuous, clever, and  erratic statesmen of the later Victorian era, and a mother who is as  brilliant as she is beautiful.    For at no time was the American wife content to be merely ornamental.  Throughout the political career of her husband she was his helpmate, and  as an officer of the Primrose League, as an editor of the _Anglo-Saxon  Review_, as, for many hot, weary months in Durban Harbor, the head  of the hospital ship _Maine_, she has shown an acute mind and real  executive power. At the polls many votes that would not respond to the  arguments of the husband, and later of the son, were gained over to the  cause by the charm and wit of the American woman.    In his earlier days, if one can have days any earlier than those he now  enjoys, Churchill was entirely influenced by two things: the tremendous  admiration he felt "]]]
