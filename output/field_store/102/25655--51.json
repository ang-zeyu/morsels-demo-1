For these are the  great salt-lagoons which make Trapani rich.           *       *       *       *       *    We are entering the harbour-basin, however, past the old castle out on  the spit, past the little lighthouse, then through the entrance,  slipping quietly on the now tranquil water. Oh, and how pleasant the  fulness of the afternoon sun flooding this round, fast-sleeping harbour,  along whose side the tall palms drowse, and whose waters are fast  asleep. It seems quite a small, cosy harbour, with the great buildings  warm-colored in the sun behind the dark tree-avenue of the marina. The  same silent, sleeping, endlessly sun-warmed stateliness.    In the midst of this tranquillity we slowly turn round upon the shining  water, and in a few moments are moored. There are other ships moored  away to the right: all asleep, apparently, in the flooding of the  afternoon sun. Beyond the harbour entrance runs the great sea and the  wind. Here all is still and hot and forgotten.    \"Vous descendez en terre?\" shouts the young woman, in her energetic  French--she leaves off holding the young men's hands for the moment. We  are not quite sure: and we don't want her to come with us, anyhow, for  her French is not our French.    The land sleeps on: nobody takes any notice of us: but just one boat  paddles out the dozen yards to our side. We decide to set foot on shore.           *       *       *       *       *    One should not, and we knew it. One should never enter into these  southern towns that look so nice, so lovely, from the outside. However,  we thought we would buy some cakes. So we crossed the avenue which looks  so beautiful from the sea, and which, when you get into it, is a cross  between an outside place where you throw rubbish and a humpy unmade road  in a raw suburb, with a few iron seats, and litter of old straw and rag.  Indescribably dreary in itself: yet with noble trees, and lovely  sunshine, and the sea and the islands gleaming magic beyond the harbour  mouth, and the sun, the eternal sun full focussed. A few mangy,  nothing-to-do people stand disconsolately about, in southern fashion,  as if they had been left there, water-logged, by the last flood, and  were waiting for the next flood to wash them further. Round the corner  along the quay a Norwegian steamer dreams that she is being loaded, in  the muddle of the small port.           *       *       *       *       *    We looked at the cakes--heavy and wan they appeared to our sea-rolled  stomachs. So we strolled into a main street, dark and dank like a sewer.  A tram bumped to a standstill, as if now at last was the end of the  world. Children coming from school ecstatically ran at our heels, with  bated breath, to hear the vocal horrors of our foreign speech. We turned  down a dark side alley, about forty paces deep: and were on the northern  bay, and on a black stench that seemed like the perpetual sewer, a bank  of mud.    So we got to the end of the black main street, and turned in haste to  the sun. Ah--in a moment we were in it. There rose the palms, there lay  our ship in the shining, curving basin--and there focussed the sun, so  that in a moment we were drunk or dazed by it. Dazed. We sat on an iron  seat in the rubbish-desolate, sun-stricken avenue.    A ragged and dirty girl was nursing a fat and moist and immovable baby  and tending to a grimy fat infant boy. She stood a yard away and gazed  at us as one would gaze at a pig one was going to buy. She came nearer,  and examined the q-b. I had my big hat down over my eyes. But no, she  had taken her seat at my side, and poked her face right under my hat  brim, so that her towzled hair touched me, and I thought she would kiss  me. But again no. With her breath on my cheek she only gazed on my face  as if it were a wax mystery. I got up hastily.    \"Too much for me,\" said I to the q-b.    She laughed, and asked what the baby was called. The baby was called  Beppina, as most babies are.    Driven forth, we wandered down the desolate avenue of shade and sun  towards the ship, and turned once more into the town. We had not been on  shore more than ten minutes. This time we went to the right, and found  more shops. The streets were dark and sunless and cold. And Trapani  seemed to me to sell only two commodities: cured rabbit skins and  cat-skins, and great, hideous, modern bed-spread arrangements of heavy  flowered silk and fabulous price. They seem to think nothing of  thousands of liras, in Trapani.    But most remarkable was bunny and pussy. Bunny and pussy, flattened out  like pressed leaves, dangling in clusters everywhere. Furs! white bunny,  black bunny in great abundance, piebald bunny, grey bunny:--then pussy,  tabby pussy, and tortoiseshell pussy, but mostly black pussy, in a  ghastly semblance of life, all flat, of course. Just single furs.  Clusters, bunches, heaps, and dangling arrays of plain-superficies puss  and bun-bun! Puss and bun by the dozen and the twenty, like dried  leaves, for your choice. If a cat from a ship should chance to find  itself in Trapani streets, it would give a mortal yell, and go mad, I am  sure.    We strolled for ten more minutes in this narrow, tortuous, unreal town,  that seemed to have plenty of flourishing inhabitants, and a fair number  of Socialists, if one was to judge by the great scrawlings on the walls:  W. LENIN and ABASSO LA BORGHESIA. Don't imagine, by the way, that Lenin  is another Wille on the list. The apparent initial stands for _Evviva_,  the double V.           *       *       *       *       *    Cakes one dared not buy, after looking at them. But we found macaroon  biscuits, and a sort of flat plaster-casts of the Infant Jesus under a  dove, of which we bought two. The q-b ate her macaroon biscuits all  through the streets, and we went towards the ship. The fat boatman  hailed us to take us back. It was just about eight yards of water to  row, the ship being moored on the quay: one could have jumped it. I gave  the fat boatman two liras, two francs. He immediately put on the  socialist-workman indignation, and thrust the note back at me. Sixty  centimes more! The fee was thirteen sous each way! In Venice or Syracuse  it would be two sous. I looked at him and gave him the money and said:  \"Per Dio, we are in Trapani!\" He muttered back something about  foreigners. But the hateful, unmanly insolence of these lords of toil,  now they have their various \"unions\" behind them and their \"rights\" as  working men, sends my blood black. They are ordinary men no more: the  human, happy Italian is most marvellously vanished. New honors come upon  them, etc. The dignity of human labour is on its hind legs, busy giving  every poor innocent who isn't ready for it a kick in the mouth.           *       *       *       *       *    But, once more in parenthesis, let me remind myself that it is our own  English fault. We have slobbered about the nobility of toil, till at  last the nobles naturally insist on eating the cake. And more than that,  we have set forth, politically, on such a high and Galahad quest of holy  liberty, and been caught so shamelessly filling our pockets, that no  wonder the naive and idealistic south turns us down with a bang.           *       *       *       *       *    Well, we are back on the ship. And we want tea. On the list by the door  it says we are to have coffee, milk and butter at 8.30: luncheon at  11.30: tea, coffee or chocolate at 3.00: and dinner at 6.30. And  moreover: \"The company will feed the passengers for the normal duration  of the voyage only.\" Very well--very well. Then where is tea? Not any  signs! and the alpaca jackets giving us a wide berth. But we find our  man, and demand our rights: at least the q-b does.    The tickets from Palermo to Cagliari cost, together, 583 liras. Of this,  250 liras was for the ticket, and 40 liras each for the food. This, for  two tickets, would make 580 liras. The odd three for usual stamps. The  voyage was supposed to last about thirty or thirty-two hours: from eight  of the morning of departure to two or four of the following afternoon.  Surely we pay for our tea.    The other passengers have emerged: a large, pale, fat, \"handsome\"  Palermitan who is going to be professor at Cagliari: his large, fat, but  high-coloured wife: and three children, a boy of fourteen like a thin,  frail, fatherly girl, a little boy in a rabbit-skin overcoat, coming  rather unfluffed, and a girl-child on the mother's knee. The  one-year-old girl-child being, of course, the only man in the party.    They have all been sick all day, and look washed out. We sympathise.  They lament the cruelties of the journey--and _senza servizio! senza  servizio!_ without any maid servant. The mother asks for coffee, and a  cup of milk for the children: then, seeing our tea with lemon, and  knowing it by repute, she will have tea. But the rabbit-boy will have  coffee--coffee and milk--and nothing else. And an orange. And the baby  will have lemon, pieces of lemon. And the fatherly young \"miss\" of an  adolescent brother laughs indulgently at all the whims of these two  young ones: the father laughs and thinks it all adorable and expects us  to adore. He is almost too washed-out to attend properly, to give the  full body of his attention.    So the mother gets her cup of tea--and puts a piece of lemon in--and  then milk on top of that. The rabbit boy sucks an orange, slobbers in  the tea, insists on coffee and milk, tries a piece of lemon, and gets a  biscuit. The baby, with weird faces, chews pieces of lemon: and drops  them in the family cup: and fishes them out with a little sugar, and  dribbles them across the table to her mouth, throws them away and  reaches for a new sour piece. They all think it humorous and adorable.  Arrives the milk, to be treated as another loving cup, mingled with  orange, lemon, sugar, tea, biscuit, chocolate, and cake.

Some wore their straight black hair flowing loose to the waist; others  gathered it in a knot at the crown of the head. They danced and sang  about the scalps of their enemies, like the tribes of the North; and  like them they had their \"medicine-men,\" who combined the functions of  physicians, sorcerers, and priests. The most prominent feature of their  religion was sun-worship.    Their villages were clusters of large dome-shaped huts, framed with  poles and thatched with palmetto leaves. In the midst was the dwelling  of the chief, much larger than the rest, and sometimes raised on an  artificial mound. They were enclosed with palisades, and, strange to  say, some of them were approached by wide avenues, artificially graded,  and several hundred yards in length. Traces of these may still be seen,  as may also the mounds in which the Floridians, like the Hurons and  various other tribes, collected at stated intervals the bones of their  dead.    Social distinctions were sharply defined among them. Their chiefs, whose  office was hereditary, sometimes exercised a power almost absolute.  Each village had its chief, subordinate to the grand chief of the  confederacy. In the language of the French narratives, they were all  kings or lords, vassals of the great monarch Satouriona, Outina, or  Potanou. All these tribes are now extinct, and it is difficult to  ascertain with precision their tribal affinities. There can be no doubt  that they were the authors of the aboriginal remains at present found in  various parts of Florida.    Having nearly finished the fort, Laudonniere declares that he \"would  not lose the minute of an houre without employing of the same in some  vertuous exercise;\" and he therefore sent his lieutenant, Ottigny, to  spy out the secrets of the interior, and to learn, above all, \"what this  Thimagoa might be, whereof the Paracoussy Satouriona had spoken to us so  often.\" As Laudonniere stood pledged to attack the Thimagoas, the chief  gave Ottigny two Indian guides, who, says the record, were so eager for  the fray that they seemed as if bound to a wedding feast.    The lazy waters of the St. John's, tinged to coffee color by the  exudations of the swamps, curled before the prow of Ottigny's sail-boat  as he advanced into the prolific wilderness which no European eye had  ever yet beheld. By his own reckoning, he sailed thirty leagues up the  river, which would have brought him to a point not far below Palatka.  Here, more than two centuries later, the Bartrams, father and son,  guided their skiff and kindled their nightly bivouac-fire; and here,  too, roamed Audubon, with his sketch-book and his gun. It was a paradise  for the hunter and the naturalist. Earth, air, and water teemed with  life, in endless varieties of beauty and ugliness. A half-tropical  forest shadowed the low shores, where the palmetto and the cabbage palm  mingled with the oak, the maple, the cypress, the liquid-ambar, the  laurel, the myrtle, and the broad glistening leaves of the evergreen  magnolia. Here was the haunt of bears, wild-cats, lynxes, cougars, and  the numberless deer of which they made their prey. In the sedges and  the mud the alligator stretched his brutish length; turtles with  outstretched necks basked on half-sunken logs; the rattlesnake sunned  himself on the sandy bank, and the yet more dangerous moccason lurked  under the water-lilies in inlets and sheltered coves. The air and the  water were populous as the earth. The river swarmed with fish, from the  fierce and restless gar, cased in his horny armor, to the lazy cat-fish  in the muddy depths. There were the golden eagle and the white-headed  eagle, the gray pelican and the white pelican, the blue heron and the  white heron, the egret, the ibis, ducks of various sorts, the whooping  crane, the black vulture, and the cormorant; and when at sunset the  voyagers drew their boat upon the strand and built their camp-fire under  the arches of the woods, the owls whooped around them all night long,  and when morning came the sultry mists that wrapped the river were vocal  with the clamor of wild turkeys.    When Ottigny was about twenty leagues from Fort Caroline, his two Indian  guides, who were always on the watch, descried three canoes, and in  great excitement cried, \"Thimagoa! Thimagoa!\" As they drew near, one of  them snatched up a halberd and the other a sword, and in their fury they  seemed ready to jump into the water to get at the enemy. To their great  disgust, Ottigny permitted the Thimagoas to run their canoes ashore and  escape to the woods. Far from keeping Laudonniere's senseless promise to  light them, he wished to make them friends; to which end he now landed  with some of his men, placed a few trinkets in their canoes, and  withdrew to a distance to watch the result. The fugitives presently  returned, step by step, and allowed the French to approach them; on  which Ottigny asked, by signs, if they had gold or silver. They replied  that they had none, but that if he would give them one of his men they  would show him where it was to be found. One of the soldiers boldly  offered himself for the venture, and embarked with them. As, however,  he failed to return according to agreement, Ottigny, on the next day,  followed ten leagues farther up the stream, and at length had the good  luck to see him approaching in a canoe. He brought little or no gold,  but reported that he had heard of a certain chief, named Mayrra,  marvellously rich, who lived three days' journey up the river; and with  these welcome tidings Ottigny went back to Fort Caroline.    A fortnight later, an officer named Vasseur went up the river to pursue  the adventure. The fever for gold had seized upon the French. As the  villages of the Thimagoas lay between them and the imagined treasures,  they shrank from a quarrel, and Laudonniere repented already of his  promised alliance with Satouriona.    Vasseur was two days' sail from the fort when two Indians hailed him  from the shore, inviting him to their dwellings. He accepted their  guidance, and presently saw before him the cornfields and palisades  of an Indian town. He and his followers were led through the wondering  crowd to the lodge of Mollua, the chief, seated in the place of honor,  and plentifully regaled with fish and bread. The repast over, Mollua  made a speech. He told them that he was one of the forty vassal chiefs  of the great Outina, lord of all the Thimagoas, whose warriors wore  armor of gold and silver plate. He told them, too, of Potanou, his  enemy, \"a man cruell in warre;\" and of the two kings of the distant  Appalachian Mountains,--Onatheaqua and Houstaqua, \"great lords and  abounding in riches.\" While thus, with earnest pantomime and broken  words, the chief discoursed with his guests, Vasseur, intent and  eager, strove to follow his meaning; and no sooner did he hear of these  Appalachian treasures than he promised to join Outina in war against  the two potentates of the mountains. Mollua, well pleased, promised that  each of Outina's vassal chiefs should requite their French allies with  a heap of gold and silver two feet high. Thus, while Laudonniere stood  pledged to Satouriona, Vasseur made alliance with his mortal enemy.    On his return, he passed a night in the lodge of one of Satouriona's  chiefs, who questioned him touching his dealings with the Thimagoas.  Vasseur replied that he had set upon them and put them to utter rout.  But as the chief, seeming as yet unsatisfied, continued his inquiries,  the sergeant Francois de la Caille drew his sword, and, like Falstaff,  reenacted his deeds of valor, pursuing and thrusting at the imaginary  Thimagoas, as they fled before his fury. The chief, at length convinced,  led the party to his lodge, and entertained them with a decoction of the  herb called Cassina.    Satouriona, elated by Laudonniere's delusive promises of aid, had  summoned his so-called vassals to war. Ten chiefs and some five hundred  warriors had mustered at his call, and the forest was alive with their  bivouacs. When all was ready, Satouriona reminded the French commander  of his pledge, and claimed its fulfilment, but got nothing but evasions  in return, He stifled his rage, and prepared to go without his fickle  ally.    A fire was kindled near the bank of the river, and two large vessels of  water were placed beside it. Here Satouriona took his stand, while his  chiefs crouched on the grass around him, and the savage visages of his  five hundred warriors filled the outer circle, their long hair garnished  with feathers, or covered with the heads and skins of wolves, cougars,  bears, or eagles. Satouriona, looking towards the country of his enemy,  distorted his features into a wild expression of rage and hate; then  muttered to himself; then howled an invocation to his god, the Sun;  then besprinkled the assembly with water from one of the vessels, and,  turning the other upon the fire, suddenly quenched it. \"So,\" he  cried, \"may the blood of our enemies be poured out, and their lives  extinguished!\" and the concourse gave forth an explosion of responsive  yells, till the shores resounded with the wolfish din.    The rites over, they set out, and in a few days returned exulting, with  thirteen prisoners and a number of scalps. These last were hung on a  pole before the royal lodge; and when night came, it brought with it a  pandemonium of dancing and whooping, drumming and feasting.    A notable scheme entered the brain of Laudonniere. Resolved, cost what  it might, to make a friend of Outina, he conceived it to be a stroke of  policy to send back to him two of the prisoners. In the morning he sent  a soldier to Satouriona to demand them. The astonished chief gave a  fiat refusal, adding that he owed the French no favors, for they had  shamefully broken"]]]
