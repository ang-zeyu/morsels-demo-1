We've been looking for you for ever so  long.\"    \"Are your father and mother at home?\" asked Aunt Eliza, slowly.    \"No, they went to town today. But they'll be home this evening.\"    \"I'm sorry they're away,\" said Aunt Eliza, coming in, \"because I can  stay only a few hours.\"    \"Oh, that's too bad,\" shouted poor Felicity, darting an angry glance at  the rest of us, as if to demand why we didn't help her out. \"Why, we've  been thinking you'd stay a week with us anyway. You MUST stay over  Sunday.\"    \"I really can't. I have to go to Charlottetown tonight,\" returned Aunt  Eliza.    \"Well, you'll take off your things and stay to tea, at least,\" urged  Felicity, as hospitably as her strained vocal chords would admit.    \"Yes, I think I'll do that. I want to get acquainted with my--my nephews  and nieces,\" said Aunt Eliza, with a rather pleasant glance around our  group. If I could have associated the thought of such a thing with my  preconception of Great-aunt Eliza I could have sworn there was a twinkle  in her eye. But of course it was impossible. \"Won't you introduce  yourselves, please?\"    Felicity shouted our names and Great-aunt Eliza shook hands all round.  She performed the duty grimly and I concluded I must have been mistaken  about the twinkle. She was certainly very tall and dignified and  imposing--altogether a great-aunt to be respected.    Felicity and Cecily took her to the spare room and then left her in the  sitting-room while they returned to the kitchen, to discuss the matter  in family conclave.    \"Well, and what do you think of dear Aunt Eliza?\" asked Dan.    \"S-s-s-sh,\" warned Cecily, with a glance at the half-open hall door.    \"Pshaw,\" scoffed Dan, \"she can't hear us. There ought to be a law  against anyone being as deaf as that.\"    \"She's not so old-looking as I expected,\" said Felix. \"If her hair  wasn't so white she wouldn't look much older than your mother.\"    \"You don't have to be very old to be a great-aunt,\" said Cecily. \"Kitty  Marr has a great-aunt who is just the same age as her mother. I expect  it was burying so many husbands turned her hair white. But Aunt Eliza  doesn't look just as I expected she would either.\"    \"She's dressed more stylishly than I expected,\" said Felicity. \"I  thought she'd be real old-fashioned, but her clothes aren't too bad at  all.\"    \"She wouldn't be bad-looking if 'tweren't for her nose,\" said Peter.  \"It's too long, and crooked besides.\"    \"You needn't criticize our relations like that,\" said Felicity tartly.    \"Well, aren't you doing it yourselves?\" expostulated Peter.    \"That's different,\" retorted Felicity. \"Never you mind Great-aunt  Eliza's nose.\"    \"Well, don't expect me to talk to her,\" said Dan, \"'cause I won't.\"    \"I'm going to be very polite to her,\" said Felicity. \"She's rich. But  how are we to entertain her, that's the question.\"    \"What does the Family Guide say about entertaining your rich, deaf old  aunt?\" queried Dan ironically.    \"The Family Guide says we should be polite to EVERYBODY,\" said Cecily,  with a reproachful look at Dan.    \"The worst of it is,\" said Felicity, looking worried, \"that there isn't  a bit of old bread in the house and she can't eat new, I've heard father  say. It gives her indigestion. What will we do?\"    \"Make a pan of rusks and apologize for having no old bread,\" suggested  the Story Girl, probably by way of teasing Felicity. The latter,  however, took it in all good faith.    \"The Family Guide says we should never apologize for things we can't  help. It says it's adding insult to injury to do it. But you run over  home for a loaf of stale bread, Sara, and it's a good idea about the  rusks. I'll make a panful.\"    \"Let me make them,\" said the Story Girl, eagerly. \"I can make real good  rusks now.\"    \"No, it wouldn't do to trust you,\" said Felicity mercilessly. \"You  might make some queer mistake and Aunt Eliza would tell it all over the  country. She's a fearful old gossip. I'll make the rusks myself. She  hates cats, so we mustn't let Paddy be seen. And she's a Methodist, so  mind nobody says anything against Methodists to her.\"    \"Who's going to say anything, anyhow?\" asked Peter belligerently.    \"I wonder if I might ask her for her name for my quilt square?\"  speculated Cecily. \"I believe I will. She looks so much friendlier than  I expected. Of course she'll choose the five-cent section. She's an  estimable old lady, but very economical.\"    \"Why don't you say she's so mean she'd skin a flea for its hide and  tallow?\" said Dan. \"That's the plain truth.\"    \"Well, I'm going to see about getting tea,\" said Felicity, \"so the rest  of you will have to entertain her. You better go in and show her the  photographs in the album. Dan, you do it.\"    \"Thank you, that's a girl's job,\" said Dan. \"I'd look nice sitting up  to Aunt Eliza and yelling out that this was Uncle Jim and 'tother Cousin  Sarah's twins, wouldn't I? Cecily or the Story Girl can do it.\"    \"I don't know all the pictures in your album,\" said the Story Girl  hastily.    \"I s'pose I'll have to do it, though I don't like to,\" sighed Cecily.  \"But we ought to go in. We've left her alone too long now. She'll think  we have no manners.\"    Accordingly we all filed in rather reluctantly. Great-aunt Eliza  was toasting her toes--clad, as we noted, in very smart and shapely  shoes--at the stove and looking quite at her ease. Cecily, determined to  do her duty even in the face of such fearful odds as Great-aunt Eliza's  deafness, dragged a ponderous, plush-covered album from its corner and  proceeded to display and explain the family photographs. She did her  brave best but she could not shout like Felicity, and half the time, as  she confided to me later on, she felt that Great-aunt Eliza did not hear  one word she said, because she didn't seem to take in who the people  were, though, just like all deaf folks, she wouldn't let on. Great-aunt  Eliza certainly didn't talk much; she looked at the photographs in  silence, but she smiled now and then. That smile bothered me. It was so  twinkly and so very un-great-aunt-Elizaish. But I felt indignant with  her. I thought she might have shown a little more appreciation of  Cecily's gallant efforts to entertain.    It was very dull for the rest of us. The Story Girl sat rather sulkily  in her corner; she was angry because Felicity would not let her make  the rusks, and also, perhaps, a little vexed because she could not charm  Great-aunt Eliza with her golden voice and story-telling gift. Felix  and I looked at each other and wished ourselves out in the hill field,  careering gloriously adown its gleaming crust.    But presently a little amusement came our way. Dan, who was sitting  behind Great-aunt Eliza, and consequently out of her view, began making  comments on Cecily's explanation of this one and that one among the  photographs. In vain Cecily implored him to stop. It was too good fun  to give up. For the next half-hour the dialogue ran after this fashion,  while Peter and Felix and I, and even the Story Girl, suffered agonies  trying to smother our bursts of laughter--for Great-aunt Eliza could see  if she couldn't hear:    CECILY, SHOUTING:--\"That is Mr. Joseph Elliott of Markdale, a second  cousin of mother's.\"    DAN:--\"Don't brag of it, Sis. He's the man who was asked if somebody  else said something in sincerity and old Joe said 'No, he said it in my  cellar.'\"    CECILY:--\"This isn't anybody in our family. It's little Xavy Gautier who  used to be hired with Uncle Roger.\"    DAN:--\"Uncle Roger sent him to fix a gate one day and scolded him  because he didn't do it right, and Xavy was mad as hops and said 'How  you 'spect me to fix dat gate? I never learned jogerfy.'\"    CECILY, WITH AN ANGUISHED GLANCE AT DAN:--\"This is Great-uncle Robert  King.\"    DAN:--\"He's been married four times. Don't you think that's often  enough, dear great-aunty?\"    CECILY:--\"(Dan!!) This is a nephew of Mr. Ambrose Marr's. He lives out  west and teaches school.\"    DAN:--\"Yes, and Uncle Roger says he doesn't know enough not to sleep in  a field with the gate open.\"    CECILY:--\"This is Miss Julia Stanley, who used to teach in Carlisle a  few years ago.\"    DAN:--\"When she resigned the trustees had a meeting to see if they'd ask  her to stay and raise her supplement. Old Highland Sandy was alive then  and he got up and said, 'If she for go let her for went. Perhaps she for  marry.'\"    CECILY, WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYR:--\"This is Mr. Layton, who used to  travel around selling Bibles and hymn books and Talmage's sermons.\"    DAN:--\"He was so thin Uncle Roger used to say he always mistook him for  a crack in the atmosphere. One time he stayed here all night and went to  prayer meeting and Mr. Marwood asked him to lead in prayer. It had been  raining 'most every day for three weeks, and it was just in haymaking  time, and everybody thought the hay was going to be ruined, and old  Layton got up and prayed that God would send gentle showers on the  growing crops, and I heard Uncle Roger whisper to a fellow behind  me, 'If somebody don't choke him off we won't get the hay made this  summer.'\"    CECILY, IN EXASPERATION:--\"(Dan, shame on you for telling such  irreverent stories.) This is Mrs. Alexander Scott of Markdale. She has  been very sick for a long time.\"    DAN:--\"Uncle Roger says all that keeps her alive is that she's scared  her husband will marry again.\"    CECILY:--\"This is old Mr. James MacPherson who used to live behind the  graveyard.\"    DAN:--\"He's the man who told mother once that he always made his own  iodine out of strong tea and baking soda.\"    CECILY:--\"This is Cousin Ebenezer MacPherson on the Markdale road.\"    DAN:--\"Great temperance man! He never tasted rum in his life. He took  the measles when he was forty-five and was crazy as a loon with them,  and the doctor ordered them to give him a dose of brandy.
