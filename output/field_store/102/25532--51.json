[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30001"],[0,"On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass (#9)"],[1,"compass, another subject with a singularly troubled historical origin.  The key text in this is the famous _Epistle on the magnet_, written by  Peter Peregrinus, a Picard, in an army camp at the Siege of Lucera and  dated August 8, 1269.[40] In spite of the precise dating it is certain  that the work was done long before, for it is quoted unmistakably by  Roger Bacon in at least three places, one of which must have been  written before _ca._ 1250.[41]    The _Epistle_ contains two parts; in the first there is a general  account of magnetism and the properties of the loadstone, closing with a  discussion \"of the inquiry whence the magnet receives the natural virtue  which it has.\" Peter attributed this virtue to a sympathy with the  heavens, proposing to prove his point by the construction of a  \"terrella,\" a uniform sphere of loadstone which is to be carefully  balanced and mounted in the manner of an armillary sphere, with its axis  directed along the polar axis of the diurnal rotation. He then  continues:      Now if the stone then move according to the motion of the    heavens, rejoice that you have arrived at a secret marvel.    But if not, let it be ascribed rather to your own want of    skill than to a defect of Nature. But in this position, or    mode of placing, I deem the virtues of this stone to be    properly conserved, and I believe that in other positions    or parts of the sky its virtue is dulled, rather than    preserved. By means of this instrument at all events you    will be relieved from every kind of clock (horologium),    for by it you will be able to know the Ascendant at    whatever hour you will, and all other dispositions of the    heavens which Astrologers seek after.    It should be noted that the device is to be mounted like an astronomical  instrument and used like one, rather than as a time teller, or as a  simple demonstration of magnetism. In the second part of the _Epistle_  Peter turns to practical instruments, describing for the first time, the  construction of a magnetic compass consisting of a loadstone or iron  needle pivoted with a casing marked with a scale of degrees. The third  chapter of this section, concluding the _Epistle_, then continues with  the description of a perpetual motion wheel, \"elaboured with marvellous  ingenuity, in the pursuit of which invention I have seen many people  wandering about, and wearied with manifold toil. For they did not  observe that they could arrive at the mastery of this by means of the  virtue, or power of this stone.\"    This tells us incidentally, that the perpetual motion device was a  subject of considerable interest at this time.[42] Oddly enough, Peter  does not now develop his idea of the terrella, but proceeds to something  quite new, a device (see fig. 22) in which a bar-magnet loadstone is to  be set towards the end of a pivoted radial arm with a circle fitted on  the inside with iron \"gear teeth,\" the teeth being there not to mesh  with others but to draw the magnet from one to the next, a little bead  providing a counterweight to help the inertia of rotation carry the  magnet from one point of attraction to the next. It is by no means the  sort of device that one would naturally evolve as a means of making  magnetism work perpetually, and I suggest that the toothed wheel is  another instance of some vague idea of protoclocks, perhaps that of Su  Sung, being transmitted from the East.    [Illustration: Figure 22.--MAGNETIC PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL illustrated  by Peter Peregrinus; from the edition of S. P. Thompson (see footnote  40).]    The work of Peter Peregrinus is cited by Roger Bacon in his _De  secretis_ as well as in the _Opus majus_ and _Opus minus_. In the first  and earliest of these occurs a description, taken from Ptolemy, of the  construction of the (observing) armillary sphere. He says that this  cannot be made to move naturally by any mathematical device, but \"a  faithful and magnificent experimentor is straining to make one out of  such material, and by such a device, that it will revolve naturally with  the diurnal heavenly rotation.\" He continues with the statement that  this possibility is also suggested by the fact that the motions of  comets, of tides, and of certain planets also follow that of the Sun and  of the heavens. Only in the _Opus minus_, where he repeats reference to  this device, does he finally reveal that it is to be made to work by  means of the loadstone.    The form of Bacon's reference to Peregrinus is strongly reminiscent of  the statement by Robertus Anglicus, already mentioned as an indication  of preoccupation with diurnally rotating wheels, at a date (1271)  remarkably close to that of the _Epistle_ (1269)--so much so that it  could well be thought that the friend to which Peter was writing was  either Robert himself or somebody associated with him, perhaps at the  University of Paris--a natural place to which the itinerant Peter might  communicate his findings.    The fundamental question here, of course, is whether the idea of an  automatic astronomical device was transmitted from Arabic, Indian, or  Chinese sources, or whether it arose quite independently in this case as  a natural concomitant of identifying the poles of the magnet with the  poles of the heavens. We shall now attempt to show that the history of  the magnetic compass might provide a quite independent argument in  favour of the hypothesis that there was a 'stimulus' transmission.          The Magnetic Compass as a Fellow-traveler from China    The elusive history of the magnetic compass has many points in common  with that of the mechanical clock. Just as we have astronomical models  from the earliest times, so we find knowledge of the loadstone and some  of its properties. Then, parallel to the development of protoclocks in  China throughout the middle ages, we have the evidence analyzed by  Needham, showing the use of the magnet as a divinatory device and of the  (nonmagnetic) south-pointing chariot, which has been confusedly allied  to the story. Curiously, and perhaps significantly the Chinese history  comes to a head at just the same time for compasses and clocks, and a  prime authority for the Chinese compass is Shen Kua (1030-1093) who also  appears in connection with the clock of Su Sung, and who wrote about the  mechanized armillary spheres and other models _ca._ 1086.    Another similarity occurs in connection with the history of the compass  in medieval Europe. The treatise of Peter Peregrinus, already discussed,  provides the first complete account of the magnetic compass with a  pivoted needle and a circular scale, and this, as we have seen, may be  connected with protoclocks and perpetual-motion devices. There are  several earlier references, however, to the use of the directive  properties of loadstone, mainly for use in navigation, but these  earliest texts have a long history of erroneous interpretation which is  only recently being cleared away. We know now that the famous passages  in the _De naturis rerum_ and _De utensilibus_ of Alexander Neckham[43]  (_ca._ 1187) and a text by Hugues de Berze[44] (after _ca._ 1204) refer  to nothing more than a floating magnet without pivot or scale, but using  a pointer at right angles to the magnet, so that it pointed to the east,  rather than the north or south. A similar method is described (_ca._  1200) in a poem by Guyot de Provins, and in a history of Jerusalem by  Jacques de Vitry (1215).[45] It is of the greatest interest that, once  more, all the evidence seems to be concentrated in France (Neckham was  teaching in Paris) though at an earlier period than that for the  protoclocks.    The date might suggest the time of the first great wave of transmissal  of learning from Islam, but it is clear that in this instance, peculiar  for that reason, that Islam learned of the magnetic compass only after  it was already known in the West. In the earliest Persian record, some  anecdotes compiled by al-'Awfi[=i] _ca._ 1230,[46] the instrument used  by the captain during a storm at sea has the form of a piece of hollow  iron, shaped like a fish and made to float on the water after  magnetization by rubbing with a loadstone; the fishlike form is very  significant, for this is distinctly Chinese practice. In a second Muslim  reference, that of Bailak al-Qab[=a]jaq[=i] (_ca._ 1282), the ordinary  wet-compass is termed \"al-konbas,\" another indication that it was  foreign to that language and culture.[47]      Chronological Chart    ------------------------------------------------------------------------      CHINA      4th C., B.C.

The plaintiffs claimed for loss of ready-made clothes  in the fire. Hawkins, who appeared for the defendant company, elicited  the fact that ready-made clothes in this firm had all brass buttons as a  rule; and, further, that after sifting the debris of the fire no buttons  had been found. The trial was not concluded on that day, but on the  following morning hundreds of buttons partially burnt were brought into  Court by the Jew plaintiffs. Cockburn was not long in appreciating this  mode of furnishing evidence after its necessity had been pointed out,  and he asked: \"How do you account for these buttons, Mr. Hawkins? You  said none were found.\"--\"Up to last night none had been found,\" replied  Hawkins. \"But,\" said the Chief Justice--\"but these buttons have  evidently been burnt in the fire. How do they come here?\"--\"_On their  own shanks_,\" was Hawkins' smart and ready reply. Verdict for  defendants.    The alibi has come in for its fair share of jests. Sir Henry Hawkins  relates in his _Reminiscences_ how he once found the following in his  brief: \"If the case is called on before 3.15, the defence is left to the  ingenuity of the counsel; if after that hour, the defence is an alibi,  as by then the usual alibi witnesses will have returned from Norwich,  where they are at present professionally engaged.\"    Sitting as a vacation judge, Sir Walter Phillimore, whose views on the  law of divorce are well known, protested against being called on to make  absolute a number of decrees _nisi_ granted in the Divorce Division.  This fact is said to have called forth a witty pronouncement by a late  president of that Division of the Courts. \"Here is my brother  Phillimore, who objects to making decrees _nisi_ absolute because he  believes in the sanctity of the marriage tie. By and by we may be having  a Unitarian appointed to the Bench, and he will refuse to try Admiralty  suits, as he would have to sit with Trinity Masters.\"    In sentencing a burglar recently, the judge referred to him as a  \"professional,\" to which the prisoner strongly protested from the dock.  \"Here,\" he exclaimed, \"I dunno wot you mean by callin' me a professional  burglar. I've only done it once before, an' I've been nabbed both  times.\" The judge, in the most suave manner, replied, \"Oh, I did not  mean to say that you had been very successful in your profession.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: THE HON. MR JUSTICE GRANTHAM, JUDGE OF THE KING'S BENCH  DIVISION.]    Mr. Justice Grantham had a keen sense of humour. On one occasion, when  he was judge at the Newcastle Assizes, he left the mansion-house where  he was staying, at night, to post his letters. As he was wearing a cap  he was not recognised by the police officer who was on duty outside, and  the constable inquired of his lordship if \"the old ---- had gone to bed  yet.\" The judge replied that he thought not, and a short while after he  had returned to the house he raised his bedroom window, and putting out  his head called to the constable below: \"Officer, the old ---- is just  going to bed now.\"    [Illustration: THE HON. MR JUSTICE DARLING, JUDGE OF THE KING'S BENCH  DIVISION.]    Hardly a case of any importance comes into Mr. Justice Darling's Court  without attracting a large attendance of the public, as much from  expectation of being entertained by the repartees between Bench and Bar  as from interest in the proceedings before the Court. In a recent turf  libel case his lordship gave a free rein to his proclivity to give an  amusing turn to statements of both counsel and witnesses. At one point  he intervened by remarking that other witnesses than the one under  examination had said that a horse is made fit by running on the course  before he is expected to win a position, and added, \"That is so, not  only on the race-course. You can never make a good lawyer by putting him  to read in the library.\" To which the defendant, who conducted his own  case, replied, \"But I take it a barrister does try.\"--\"You have no  notion how he tries the judge,\" responded Mr. Justice Darling. In the  same case a question arose as to whether the stewards of the Jockey Club  had the power to check riding \"short,\" as it is termed, and the Justice  inquired if the stewards could say, \"You must ride with a leather of a  prescribed length,\" and got the answer, \"Yes; they could say if you  don't ride longer we won't give you a license.\"--\"Which means,\" said the  judge, \"if you don't ride longer you won't ride long.\"    \"Who made the translation from the German?\" asked the same judge,  regarding a document to which counsel had referred. \"God knows; I  don't,\" was the reply of Mr. Danckwerts. \"Are you sure,\" responded the  Justice, \"that what is not known to you is known at all?\"    Perhaps Mr. Justice Darling never raised heartier laughter than in an  action some years ago where the issue was whether the plaintiff, who had  been engaged by the defendant to sing in \"potted opera\" at a music-hall,  was competent to fulfil his contract.    \"Well, he could not sing like the archangel Gabriel,\" a witness had  said, in reply to Mr. Duke, K. C.    \"I have never heard the archangel Gabriel,\" commented the eminent  counsel.    \"That, Mr. Duke, is a pleasure to come,\" was his lordship's swift, if  gently sarcastic, rejoinder.           *       *       *       *       *    If witnesses occasionally undergo severe handling in cross-examination  by counsel, there are also occasions when their ready reply has rather  nonplussed the judge.    A case was being tried at York before Mr. Justice Gould. When it had  proceeded for upwards of two hours the judge observed that there were  only eleven jurymen in the box, and inquired where the twelfth man was.  \"Please you, my lord,\" said one of them, \"he has gone away about some  business, but he has left his verdict with me.\"    \"How old are you?\" asked the judge of a lady witness.  \"Thirty.\"--\"Thirty!\" said the judge; \"I have heard you give the same age  in this Court for the last three years.\"--\"Yes,\" responded the lady; \"I  am not one of those persons who say one thing to-day and another  to-morrow.\"    Mr. Justice Keating one day had occasion to examine a witness who  stuttered very much in giving his evidence. \"I believe,\" said his  lordship, \"you are a very great rogue.\"--\"Not so great a rogue as you,  my lord--t--t--t--t--take me to be,\" was the reply.    Judge: \"Is this your signature?\"    Witness: \"I don't know.\"    Judge: \"Look at it carefully.\"    Witness: \"I can't say for certain.\"    Judge: \"Is it anything like your writing?\"    Witness: \"I don't think it is.\"    Judge: \"Can't you identify it?\"    Witness: \"Not quite.\"    Judge: \"Well, let me see, just write your name here and I will examine  the two signatures.\"    Witness: \"I can't write, sir.\"    Medical men are not as a rule the best witnesses, being too fond of  using technical words peculiar to them in their own profession. In an  action for assault tried by a Derbyshire common jury before Mr. Justice  Patteson, a surgical witness was asked to describe the injuries the  plaintiff had received; he stated he had \"ecchymosis\" of the left eye.  Upon the judge inquiring whether that did not mean what was commonly  understood by a black eye, the witness answered: \"Yes.\"--\"Then why did  you not say so, sir? What do the jury know of 'ecchymosis'? They might  think, as the farmer did of the word 'felicity,' used by a clergyman in  his sermon, that it meant something in the inside of a pig.\"    A notorious thief, being tried for his life, confessed the robbery he  was charged with. The judge thereupon directed the jury to find him  guilty upon his own confession. The jury having consulted together  brought him in \"Not guilty.\" The judge bade them consider their verdict  again, but still they brought in a verdict of \"Not guilty.\" The judge  asking the reason, the foreman replied: \"There is reason enough, for we  all know him to be one of the greatest liars in the country.\"    \"Have you committed all these crimes?\" asked the judge of a hoary old  sinner. \"Yes, my lord, and worse.\" \"Worse, I should have thought it  impossible. What have you done then?\"--\"My lord, I allowed myself to be  caught.\"    \"I knows yer,\" said a prisoner to the present Lord Chief Justice, \"and  many's the time I've given yer a hand when ye've been stepping it round  the track like a greyhound. So let's down lightly, like a good cove as  yer are.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The retort of a witness to Lord Avory was too good to be soon forgotten,  and is still circulating among the juniors of the law-courts. \"Let me  see,\" said his lordship, \"you have been convicted before, haven't  you?\"--\"Yes, sir,\" answered the man; \"but it was due to the incapacity  of my counsel rather than to any fault on my part.\"--\"It always is,\"  said Lord Avory, with a grim smile, \"and you have my sincere  sympathy.\"--\"And I deserve it,\" retorted the man, \"seeing that you were  my counsel on that occasion!\"          CHAPTER TWO    THE BARRISTERS OF ENGLAND          \"Hark the hour of ten is sounding!
