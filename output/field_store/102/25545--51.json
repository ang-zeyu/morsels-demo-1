Us been married 51 years now.          420150           JOHN BATES, 84, was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, a slave of Mock       Bateman. When still very young, John moved with his mother, a slave       of Harry Hogan, to Limestone Co., Texas. John now lives in       Corsicana, supported by his children and an old age pension.      \"My pappy was Ike Bateman, 'cause his massa's name am Mock Bateman, and  mammy's name was Francis. They come from Tennessee and I had four  brothers and six sisters. We jes' left de last part of de name off and  call it Bates and dat's how I got my name. Mammy 'longed to Massa Harry  Hogan and while I's small us move to Texas, to Limestone County, and I  don't 'member much 'bout pappy, 'cause I ain't never seed him since.    \"Massa Hogan was a purty good sort of fellow, but us went hongry de fust  winter in Texas. He lived in de big log house with de hallway clean  through and a gallery clean 'cross de front. De chimney was big 'nough  to burn logs in and it sho' throwed out de heat. It was a good, big  place and young massa come out early and holler for us to git up and be  in de field.    \"Missy Hogan was de good woman and try her dead level best to teach me  to read and write, but my head jes' too thick, I jes' couldn't larn. My  Uncle Ben he could read de Bible and he allus tell us some day us be  free and Massa Harry laugh, haw, haw, haw, and he say, 'Hell, no, yous  never be free, yous ain't got sense 'nough to make de livin' if yous was  free.' Den he takes de Bible 'way from Uncle Ben and say it put de bad  ideas in he head, but Uncle gits 'nother Bible and hides it and massa  never finds it out.    \"We'uns goes to de big baptisin' one time and it's at de big sawmill  tank and 50 is baptise' and I's in dat bunch myself. But dey didn't have  no funerals for de slaves, but jes' bury dem like a cow or a hoss, jes'  dig de hole and roll 'em in it and cover 'em up.    \"War come and durin' dem times jes' like today nearly everybody knows  what gwine on, news travels purty fast, and iffen de slaves couldn't git  it with de pass dey slips out after dark and go in another plantation by  de back way. Course, iffen dem patterrollers cotch dem it jus' too bad  and dey gits whip.    \"When de news comes in dat us free, Massa Harry never call us up like  everybody else did the slaves, us has to go up and ask him 'bout it. He  come out on de front gallery and says we is free and turns 'round and  goes in de house without 'nother word. We all sho' feels sorry for him  the way he acts and hates to leave him, but we wants to go. We knowed he  wasn't able to give us nothin' so begins to scatter and 'bout ten or  fifteen days Massa Harry dies. I think he jes' grieve himself to death,  all he trouble comin' on him to once.    \"Us worked on diff'rent farms till I marries and my fust wife am Emma  Williams and a cullud preacher marries us at her house. Us picked cotton  after dat and den I rents a place on de halvers for five year and after  sev'ral years I buys eighty acres of land. Fin'ly us done paid dat out  and done some repairs and den us sep'rate after livin' twenty-three year  together. So I gives dat place to her and de six chillen and I walks out  ready to start all over 'gain.    \"Then I meets Sarah Jones and us marries, but she gives me de  divorcement. All dis time I works on a farm for de day wages, den I  rents 'nother farm on de halvers on de black land and stays dere sev'ral  year. Fin'ly I gits de job workin' at de cotton oil mill in Corsicana  and stays at dat job till dey says I's too old. I done buy dis li'l home  here and now has a place to live. Sarah done come back to me and us has  seven chillen. One of de boys works at de cotton oil mill and two works  at de compress right here in Corsicana and one works at de beer place in  Dallas.    \"Us raises a li'l on dese two lots and de chillen brings some from de  farm, I mean my fust wife's chillen, and with de pension check us manage  to live a li'l longer. Us boys pays de taxes and de insurance for us.          420306           HARRISON BECKETT, born a slave of I.D. Thomas of San Augustine,       Texas, now lives in Beaumont. A great-grandson climbed into       Harrison's lap during the interview, and his genial face lit up       with a smile. He chuckled as he told of his own boyhood days, and       appeared to enjoy reminiscing. At times he uses big words, some of       his own coining.      \"I's 'mong de culls now, like a hoss what am too old. I's purty small  yit when 'mancipation comes and didn't have no hard work. Old Massa have  me and de other li'l niggers keep de stock out de fields. Us li'l  boogers have to run and keep de cows out de corn and de cotton patch.  Dat ought to been 'nough to keep us out of debbilment.    \"It come to pass my mammy work in de field. Her name Cynthia Thomas and  daddy's name Isaac Thomas. But after freedom he goes back to Florida and  find out he people and git he real name, and dat am Beckett. Dat 'bout  ten years after 'mancipation he go back to he old home in Florida.  Mammy's people was de Polkses, in Georgia. Mammy come in from de field  at nine or ten o'clock at night and she be all wore out and too tired to  cook lots of times. But she have to git some food for us. We all had a  tin pan and git round de table and dat like a feast. But lots of times  she's so tired she go to bed without eatin' nothin' herself.    \"My sisters was Ellen and Sani and Georgy-Ann and Cindy and Sidi-Ann.  Dey's all big 'nough to work in de field. My brudders name Matthew and  Ed and Henry and Harry, what am me, and de oldes' one am General Thomas.    \"Dey more'n a hundred head of black folks on Massa Thomas' two farms,  and 'bout a hundred fifty acres in each farm. One de farms in iron ore,  what am red land, and de other in gray land, half sand and half black  dirt.    \"Us slaves live in pole houses and some in split log houses, with two  rooms, one for to sleep in and one for to cook in. Day ain't  no glass windows, jus' holes in de walls. Dere was jack beds to sleep  on, made out of poles. Dey has four legs and ain't nail to de walls.    \"Old Massa he care for he hands purty well, considerin' everything. In  ginnin' time he 'low de women to pick up cotton from de ground and make  mattresses and quilts. He make some cloth and buy some. A woman weave  all de time and when de shickle jump out on de floor I picks it up. I  used to could knit socks and I was jes' a li'l boy then, but I keep  everything in 'membrance.    \"Dey have some school and de chillen larnt readin' and writin', and  manners and behaviour, too. Sometime dey git de broke-down white man to  be teacher. But us didn't know much and it taken ten years or more after  freedom to git de black men de qualification way he could handle things.    \"One time us boys git some watermillions out in de bresh and hit 'em or  drap 'em to break 'em open. Dere come massa and cotch us not workin',  but eatin' he watermillions. He tell my daddy to whip me. But lots of  times when us sposed to mind de calves, us am out eatin' watermillions  in de bresh. Den de calves git out and massa see dem run and cotch us.    \"Old massa was kind and good, though. He have partiality 'bout him, and  wouldn't whip nobody without de cause. He whip with de long, keen switch  and it didn't bruise de back, but sho' did sting. When he git real mad,  he pull up you shirt and whip on de bare hide. One time he whippin' me  and I busts de button off my shirt what he holdin' on to, and runs  away. I tries to outrun him, and dat tickle him. I sho' give de ground  fits with my feets. But dem whippin's done me good. Dey break me up from  thievin' and make de man of me.    \"De way dey dress us li'l nigger boys den, dey give us a shirt what come  way down 'tween de knees and ankles. When de weather am too cold, dey  sometimes give us pants.    \"De white preachers come round and preach. Dey have de tabernacle like a  arbor and cullud folks come from all round to hear de Gospel 'spounded.  Most every farm have de cullud man larnin' to preach. I used to 'long to  de Methodists but now I 'longs to de Church of Christ.    \"Massa Thomas, he de wholesale merchant and git kilt in New Orleans. A  big box of freight goods fall on him, a box 'bout a yard square on de  end and six yards long. He's carryin' back some good for to make  exchangement and dey pullin' up de box with pulley and rope and it fall  on him. De New Orleans folks say it am de accidentment, but de rest say  de rope am cut. One of massa's old friends was Lawyer Brooks. He used to  firmanize de word.    \"Massa have two boys, Mr. Jimmie and Li'l Ide and dey both goes to de  war. Li'l Ide, he go up in Arkansas and dey say when dat first cannon  busts at Li'l Rock, he starts runnin' and never stops till he gits back  home. I don't see how he could do dat, 'cause Li'l Rock am way far off,  but dat what dey say. Den de men comes to git 'serters and dey gits Li'l  Ide and takes him back. Mr. Jimmie, he didn't break de ranks. He stood  he ground.    \"Mammy and dem tell me when war am over de boss and he wife, dey calls  de slaves up in de bunch and tells 'em, 'You's free as I is. Keep on or  quit, if you wants. You don't have to stay no further, you's free  today.' Dat near June 19th, and all of 'em stays. Massa say, 'Go 'head  and finish de crop and I feed you and pay you.' Dey all knowed when he  kilt de hawgs us git plenty of meat. Dat young massa say all dat, 'cause  old massa done git kilt.    \"It's at Panola County where I first hears of de Klux. Dey call dem  White Caps den. Dey move over in Panola County and ranges at de place  call Big Creek Merval by McFaddin Creek. Dey's purty rough. De  landowners tell dey niggers not to kill de White Caps but to scare dem  'way. At night dey come knock and if you don't open it dey pry it open  and run you out in de field."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3066"],[0,"The Red Man's Continent: A Chronicle of Aboriginal America (#9)"],[1,"that the region well deserves the old  Indian name of the \"Endless Mountains.\" Southwestward the valley grows  narrower, and the ridges which break its surface become straighter.  Everywhere they are flat-topped, steep-sided, and narrow, while between  them lie parts of the main valley floor, flat and fertile. Here in the  south, even more clearly than in the north, the valley is bordered  on the east by the sharply upstanding range of the crystalline  Appalachians, while on the west with equal regularity it comes to an end  in an escarpment which rises to the Alleghany plateau.    This plateau, the third great band of the Appalachians, begins on the  south side of the Mohawk Valley. To the north its place is taken by  the Adirondacks, which are an outlier of the great Laurentian area of  Canada. The fact that the outlier and the plateau are separated by the  low strip of the Mohawk Valley makes this the one place where the highly  complex Appalachian system can easily be crossed. If the Alleghany  plateau joined the Adirondacks, Philadelphia instead of New York would  be the greatest city of America. Where the plateau first rises on the  south side of the Mohawk, it attains heights of four thousand feet in  the Catskill Mountains. We think of the Catskills as mountains, but  their steep cliffs and table-topped heights show that they are really  the remnants of a plateau, the nearly horizontal strata of which  have not yet been worn away. Westward from the Catskills the plateau  continues through central New York to western Pennsylvania. Those who  have traveled on the Pennsylvania Railroad may remember how the railroad  climbs the escarpment at Altoona. Farther east the train has passed  alternately through gorges cut in the parallel ridges and through  fertile open valleys forming the main floor of the inner valley. Then it  winds up the long ascent of the Alleghany front in a splendid horseshoe  curve. At the top, after a short tunnel, the train emerges in a wholly  different country. The valleys are without order or system. They wind  this way and that. The hills are not long ridges but isolated bits left  between the winding valleys. Here and there beds of coal blacken the  surface, for here we are among the rocks from which the world's largest  coal supply is derived. Since the layers lie horizontally and have never  been compressed, the same material which in the inner valley has been  changed to hard, clean-burning anthracite here remains soft and smoky.    In its southwestern continuation through West Virginia and Kentucky  to Tennessee the plateau maintains many of its Pennsylvanian  characteristics, but it now rises higher and becomes more inaccessible.  The only habitable portions are the bottoms of the valleys, but they are  only wide enough to support a most scanty population. Between them most  of the land is too rough for anything except forests. Hence the people  who live at the bottoms of the valleys are strangely isolated. They see  little or nothing of the world at large or even of their neighbors. The  roads are so few and the trails so difficult that the farmers cannot  easily take their produce to market. Their only recourse has been to  convert their bulky corn into whisky, which occupied little space in  proportion to its value. Since the mountaineer has no other means of  getting ready money, it is not strange that he has become a moonshiner  and has fought bitterly for what he genuinely believed to be his rights  in that occupation. Education has not prospered on the plateau because  the narrowness of the valleys causes the population to be too poor and  too scattered to support schools. For the same reason feuds grow up.  When people live by themselves they become suspicious. Not being used to  dealing with their neighbors, they suspect the motives of all but their  intimate friends. Moreover, in those deep valleys, with their steep  sides and their general inaccessibility, laws cannot easily be enforced,  and therefore each family takes the law into its own hands.    Today the more rugged parts of the Appalachian system are chiefly  important as a hindrance to communication. On the Atlantic slope of the  old crystalline band there are great areas of gentle relief where an  abundant population can dwell. Westward on the edges of the plateau and  the plains beyond a still greater population can find a living, but in  the intervening space there is opportunity for only a few. The great  problem is to cross the mountains as easily as possible. Each accessible  crossing-place is associated with a city. Boston, as well as New York,  owes much to the low Mohawk-Hudson route, but is badly handicapped  because it has no easy means of crossing the eastern crystalline band.  Philadelphia, on the other hand, benefits from the fact that in its  vicinity the crystallizes are low and can readily be crossed even  without the aid of the valleys of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers.  It is handicapped, however, by the Alleghany escarpment at Altoona, even  though this is lower there than farther south. Baltimore, in the same  way, owes much of its growth to the easy pathways of the Susquehanna  on the north and the Potomac on the south. Farther south both the  crystalline band and the Alleghany plateau become more difficult to  traverse, so that communication between the Atlantic coast and the  Mississippi Valley is reduced to small proportions. Happy is New York  in its situation where no one of the three bands of the Appalachians  opposes any obstacle. The plains of North America form the third of the  four main physical divisions of the continent. For the most part they  lie between the great western cordillera on one side and the Laurentian  and Appalachian highlands on the other. Yet they lap around the southern  end of the Appalachians and run far up the Atlantic coast to New York.  They remained beneath the sea till a late date, much later than the  other three divisions. They were not, however, covered with deep water  like that of the abysmal oceans, but only with shallow seas from which  the land at times emerged. In spite of the old belief to the contrary,  the continents appear to be so permanent that they have occupied  practically their present positions from the remotest geological times.  They have moved slowly up and down, however, so that some parts have  frequently been submerged, and the plains are the parts that remained  longest under water.    The plains of North America may be divided into four parts according  to the character of their surface: the Atlantic coastal plain, the  prairies, the northwestern peneplain, and the southwestern high plains.  The Atlantic coastal plain lies along the Atlantic coast from New York  southward to Florida and Alabama. It also forms a great embayment up the  Mississippi Valley as far as the Ohio River, and it extends along the  shore of the Gulf of Mexico to the Rio Grande. The chief characteristic  of this Atlantic and Gulf coastal plain is its belted nature. One layer  of rocks is sandy, another consists of limestone, and a third of clay.  When uplifted and eroded each assumes its own special topography and is  covered with its own special type of vegetation. Thus in South Carolina  and Georgia the crystalline Piedmont band of the Appalachian province  is bordered on the southeast by a belt of sandstone. This rock is so  far from the sea and has been raised so high above it that erosion has  converted it into a region of gentle hills, whose tops are six hundred  or seven hundred feet above sea-level. Its sandy soil is so poor that  farming is difficult. The hills are largely covered with pine, yielding  tar and turpentine. Farther seaward comes a broad band of younger rock  which forms a clayey soil or else a yellow sandy loam. These soils are  so rich that splendid cotton crops can be raised, and hence the region  is thickly populated. Again there comes a belt of sand, the so-called  \"pine barrens,\" which form a poor section about fifty miles inland from  the coast. Finally the coastal belt itself has emerged from beneath the  sea so recently and lies so nearly at sea-level that it has not been  greatly eroded, and is still covered with numerous marshes and swamps.  The rich soil and the moisture are good for rice, but the region is so  unhealthy and so hard to drain that only small parts are inhabited.    Everywhere in the coastal plain this same belted character is more  or less evident. It has much to do with all sorts of activities from  farming to politics. On consulting the map showing the cotton production  of the United States in 1914, one notices the two dark bands in the  southeast. One of them, extending from the northwestern part of South  Carolina across Georgia and Alabama, is due to the fertile soil of  the Piedmont region. The other, lying nearer the sea, begins in North  Carolina and extends well into Alabama before it swings around to the  northwest toward the area of heavy production along the Mississippi. It  is due to the fertile soil of that part of the coastal plain known  as the \"cotton belt.\" Portions of it are called the \"black belt,\" not  because of the colored population, but because of the darkness of the  soil. Since this land has always been prosperous, it has regularly been  conservative in politics.    The Atlantic coastal plain is by no means the only part of the United  States where the fertility of the soil is the dominant fact in the life  of the people. Because of their rich soil the prairies which extend from  western Ohio to the Missouri River and northward into Canada are fast  becoming the most steadily prosperous part of America. They owe their  surpassing richness largely to glaciation. We have already seen how the  coming of the ice-sheet benefited the regions on the borders of the old  Laurentian highland. This same benefit extended over practically the  whole of what are now the prairies."]]]
