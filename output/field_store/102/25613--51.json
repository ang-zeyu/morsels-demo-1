The bride and bridegroom in this case  possess both. I've given in to Esther so far as to consent that the  marriage should be put off for a year. That will give her time to learn  to do her duty. Many changes take place in a year.'    \"The old man was right. Many changes take place in a year. The greatest  possible change had taken place in beautiful Esterka, but it was not the  change that her father had expected or wished to see. Look here, the  doctor there looks upon me as hating all Jews, but I am perfectly just  to them, and I tell you that the girl, although inwardly depraved, had  hitherto conducted herself in the most praiseworthy manner. And yet her  temptations must have been very great. She was known throughout the  whole district, and every one called her the 'beautiful Jewess.' The inn  and bar down-stairs had more visitors than Moses cared for. When the  young nobles of the district came to Barnow on magisterial business,  they spread out the work they had to do over three days, instead of  contenting themselves with one as before; the unmarried lawyers and  custom-house officials spent their whole time at the bar; and as for the  hussar officers, they took up their quarters there altogether. These  men, one and all, paid their court to Esther, but she never wasted a  thought upon one of them. Her father kept her as much as possible out of  the way of his customers. When she met them, she returned their greeting  courteously, but was as if deaf to their compliments and flattery. And  if any one was rude to her, she was quite able to defend herself. Young  Baron Starsky found that out to his cost--you know him, don't you? A  tall fair man, and the hero of that queer story about Graefin Jadwiga  Bortynska. Well, he once met Esther as he was leaving the bar-parlor  rather the worse for wine. He will never forget that meeting, because of  the tremendous box on the ear that she gave him.    \"There was a change in her after her engagement. Not that she was on  more friendly terms with these men than before, but that she no longer  rebuffed one of their number. This favored individual was a captain in  the Wuertemberg Hussars, Graf Geza Szapany by name. He was like a hero of  romance: tall, slight, and interesting-looking, with dark hair, black  eyes, and a lovely little mustache. This is no flattering portrait, I  can assure you; our friend Hortensia will bear witness that I do not  exaggerate, she used to know him too....\"    Frau Hortensia, a handsome blonde, and wife of the assistant judge of  the district, blushes scarlet, and casts an angry look at her \"friend\"  and hostess, but forces herself to answer indifferently, \"Ah yes, to be  sure, I remember him.... He was a good-looking man.\"    \"Good-looking,\" repeats Frau Kasimira. \"He was more than that. He was  very handsome; and so interesting! His manners were perfect. He  thoroughly understood the art of making himself agreeable to women; but  that was natural enough, for he had had plenty of experience. Beautiful  Esterka was soon caught in his toils. He approached her almost shyly,  and spoke to her with the utmost respect; and more than all, he paid her  no compliments. That helped on his cause wonderfully. And then you  mustn't forget what I told you before, that she was depraved at heart,  and foolishly romantic. The affair ran the usual course. At first a few  meetings, then many; at first but a few words were exchanged, afterward  many; at first one kiss, then many more.... It was very amusing!\"    Every one present seems to regard it in the same light as Frau Kasimira.  The ladies giggle and the gentleman laugh. One lady alone remains  grave--and she is the fat, kind-hearted German woman sitting in the  corner of the sofa.    \"You don't seem to be amused by the story,\" observes the doctor, who is  sitting beside her.    \"No,\" she answers. \"It is a very sad story. The poor girl was a victim.\"    \"Yes,\" says the doctor, his voice sounding deep and low with suppressed  feeling, \"she was a victim. But she was not a victim of the handsome  hussar, nor even of our kind hostess here. The cause of her ruin lies  deeper, much deeper than that. As the twilight is more eerie than  complete darkness, so a half education is more dangerous than absolute  ignorance. Darkness and ignorance alike lay a bandage over the eyes and  prevent the feet from straying beyond the threshold of the known;  knowledge and light open the eyes of man and enable him to advance  boldly on the path that lies before him; while half knowledge and  twilight only remove part of the bandage and leave him to grope about  blindly, perhaps even cause him to fall! Poor child! she was snatched  away from the pure stream, and her thirst was so great that she strove  to slake it in any puddles she passed on the way. Poor child! She....\"    Here a yawn interrupts the speaker. The fat woman is thoroughly good and  kind, but she is by no means intellectual, and hates having to listen to  what she does not understand.    Meanwhile Frau Kasimira continues as follows:    \"So Graf Geza soon succeeded in gaining complete influence over her. And  when he left this to be stationed at Marburg, she followed him there.  One Friday evening--just like to-day--when Moses came home, he found the  nest empty. There was a great uproar down-stairs. They called her,  sought her everywhere with tears--no words can describe the scene. My  husband went down-stairs--Moses raged like a madman. It all happened  five years ago, but I shall never forget that night....    \"The next few days were very uncomfortable and queer. They all went on  as if Esther were dead. The shop and bar were both closed; the pictures  were hung with black; the mirrors were turned with their faces to the  wall. A small lamp was burnt in a corner of her room for seven days and  seven nights, and during the whole of that time Moses sat on the floor  of the room barefoot and with his clothes torn. I don't know whether it  is true, but I heard that the Jews took an empty coffin to the cemetery  on the Sunday following, and then filled in an empty grave. I have been  told that they even went so far as to put up a gravestone to Esther! On  the eighth day Moses rose up and went quietly about his business again.  These Jews are such strange creatures! Only fancy! he came to us that  very day to ask for his rent. I scarcely recognized him--his hair had  turned quite gray in the course of a week. His manner was quiet and  composed, and he seems to have forgotten all about his daughter now. But  as everybody knows, the Jews are fonder of their money than of their  children!\"    \"Has no one heard anything more about Esther?\" asks the fat woman.    \"Yes--once. But what we heard wasn't much to be relied on. Little  Lieutenant Szilagy--you remember what fibs he used to tell--went to  spend his leave in Hungary on one occasion, and when he came back, he  declared that he had seen Graf Geza and Esther in a box in the National  Theatre at Pesth. But the little man tells so many lies that one never  knows how much to believe. It may quite well have been some other pretty  girl.\"    \"Do you know,\" says Frau Emilie, the highly educated lady from Lemberg,  \"do you know what this story reminds me of? Of a very amusing play I  once saw acted in Lemberg. It was translated from the English of a  certain ... oh dear! these English names....\"    \"Perhaps you mean Shakespeare?\" inquires the doctor, coming to the  rescue.    \"Shakespeare,\" repeats the district judge; \"he's a rather well-known  poet.\"    \"Yes; a very talented man!\" says the doctor, with the utmost gravity.    \"You're right--Shakespeare!\" continues Frau Emilie; \"and the play was  called 'The Merchant of Venice.' There is a Jew in it, Shylock by name,  whose daughter also ran away, and who, like Moses, was far fonder of his  money than of his child. I therefore propose that we should no longer  call the Freudenthal of to-day by his own name, but instead of  that\"--the speaker makes a long pause--\"the Shylock--of Barnow!\"    The registrar feels very proud of his clever wife. The gentlemen laugh,  the ladies titter, and even the estate-agent's fat wife smiles as they  one and all repeat:    \"Ha! ha! ha! The Shylock of Barnow!\"           *       *       *       *       *    But they do not laugh next morning. They never laugh at Shylock  again--neither they nor any one else.    The wan pale light of the Sabbath morning dawns upon a woful sight. It  is a damp, misty, disagreeable morning. The wind, which had risen at  midnight, and had driven the heavy black clouds across the sky, covering  the moon as though with a pall, has fallen; but the clouds are heavier  and blacker than ever, and a thick cold mist inwraps the whole plain and  the gloomy little town.    All sleep soundly in the small houses of the Ghetto. Not a step is to be  heard in the narrow streets. The dogs in the courtyards, and the  night-watchman in front of the town-hall, are alone awake. The latter is  usually asleep at this hour, but the dogs are making too much noise to  allow him even to fall into a doze. They are barking furiously. The dogs  at the town-gate are the first to begin it, then the watch-dog at the  monastery takes up the chorus, and lastly, Moses Freudenthal's black  \"Britan\" joins in the uproar. The wise watchman therefore makes up his  mind that some stranger is passing the monastery and going toward the  Jew's house. But it never occurs to him to go and see who it is. The  mist makes the morning very dark, and the streets very slippery. So the  guardian of Barnow remains quietly in his little box in front of the  town-hall. \"Britan is barking so loud,\" he says to himself, consolingly,  \"that the Jew can't help hearing him.\"    He is not mistaken. The people in Freudenthal's house hear the furious  barking. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#9)"],[1,"s.    I watch it for a whole afternoon. It writhes about; it moves its little  head now in this direction, now in that, frequently laying it on the  Cetonia, but without fixing it anywhere. The day draws to a close; and  still it has accomplished nothing. There are restless movements, nothing  more. Hunger, I tell myself, will eventually induce it to bite. I am  wrong. Next morning I find it more anxious than the day before and still  groping about, without resolving to fix its mandibles anywhere. I  leave it alone for half a day longer without obtaining any result. Yet  twenty-four hours of abstinence must have awakened a good appetite,  above all in a creature which, if left undisturbed, would not have  ceased eating.    Excessive hunger cannot induce it to nibble at an unlawful spot. Is this  due to feebleness of the teeth? By no means: the Cetonia's skin is no  tougher on the back than on the belly; moreover, the grub is capable of  perforating the skin when it leaves the egg; a fortiori, it must be more  capable of doing so now that it has attained a sturdy growth. Thus we  see no lack of ability, but an obstinate refusal to nibble at a point  which ought to be respected. Who knows? On this side perhaps the grub's  dorsal vessel would be wounded, its heart, an organ indispensable to  life. The fact remains that my attempts to make the grub tackle its  victim from the back have failed. Does this mean that it entertains the  least suspicion of the danger which it might incur were it to produce  putrefaction by awkwardly carving its victuals from the back? It would  be absurd to give such an idea a moment's consideration. Its refusal is  dictated by a preordained decree which it is bound to obey.    My Scolia-grubs would die of starvation if I left them on their victim's  back. I therefore restore matters as they were, with the Cetonia-larva  belly uppermost and the young Scolia on top. I might utilise the  subjects of my previous experiments; but, as I have to take precautions  against the disturbance which may have been caused by the test already  undergone, I prefer to operate on new patients, a luxury in which the  richness of my menagerie allows me to indulge. I move the Scolia from  its position, extract its head from the entrails of the Cetonia-larva  and leave it to its own resources on its victim's belly. Betraying every  symptom of uneasiness, the grub gropes, hesitates, casts about and does  not insert its mandibles anywhere, though it is now the ventral surface  which it is exploring. It would not display greater hesitation if placed  on the back of the larva. I repeat, who knows? On this side it might  perhaps injure the nervous plexus, which is even more essential than the  dorsal vessel. The inexperienced grub must not drive in its mandibles at  random; its future is jeopardized if it gives a single ill-judged bite.  If it gnaws at the spot where I myself operated with my needle wrought  into a scalpel, its victuals will very soon turn putrid. Once more,  then, we witness an absolute refusal to perforate the skin of the victim  elsewhere than at the very point where the egg was fixed.    The mother selects this point, which is undoubtedly that most favourable  to the future prosperity of the larva, though I am not able clearly to  discern the reasons for her choice; she fixes the egg to it; and the  place where the opening is to be made is henceforth determined. It is  here that the grub must bite: only here, never elsewhere. Its invincible  refusal to tackle the Cetonia in any other part, even though it should  die of starvation, shews us how rigorous is the rule of conduct with  which its instinct is inspired.    As it gropes about, the grub laid on the victim's ventral surface sooner  or later rediscovers the gaping wound from which I have removed it. If  this takes too long for my patience, I can myself guide its head to the  place with the point of a paint-brush. The grub then recognizes the hole  of its own making, slips its neck into it and little by little dives  into the Cetonia's belly, so that the original state of affairs appears  to be exactly restored. And yet its successful rearing is henceforth  highly problematical. It is possible that the larva will prosper,  complete its development and spin its cocoon; it is also possible--and  the case is not unusual--that the Cetonia-larva will soon turn brown  and putrid. We then see the Scolia itself turn brown, distended as it  is with putrescent foodstuffs, and then cease all movement, without  attempting to withdraw from the sanies. It dies on the spot, poisoned by  its excessively high game.    What can be the meaning of this sudden corruption of the victuals,  followed by the death of the Scolia, when everything appeared to have  returned to its normal condition? I see only one explanation.  Disturbed in its activities and diverted from its usual courses by  my interference, the grub, when replaced on the wound from which I  extracted it, was unable to rediscover the lode at which it was working  a few minutes earlier; it thrust its way at random into the victim's  entrails; and a few untimely bites extinguished the last sparks of  vitality. Its confusion rendered it clumsy; and the mistake cost it its  life. It dies poisoned by the rich food which, if consumed according to  the rules, should have made it grow plump and lusty.    I was anxious to observe the deadly effects of a disturbed meal in  another fashion. This time the victim itself shall disorder the grub's  activities. The Cetonia-larva, as served up to the young Scolia by its  mother, is profoundly paralysed. Its inertia is complete and so striking  that it constitutes one of the leading features of this narrative. But  we will not anticipate. For the moment, the thing is to substitute for  this inert larva a similar larva, but one not paralysed, one very much  alive. To ensure that it shall not double up and crush the grub, I  confine myself to reducing it to helplessness, leaving it otherwise just  as I extracted it from its burrow. I must also be careful of its legs  and mandibles, the least touch of which would rip open the nurseling.  With a few turns of the finest wire I fix it to a little slab of cork,  with its belly in the air. Next, to provide the grub with a ready-made  hole, knowing that it will refuse to make one for itself, I contrive a  slight incision in the skin, at the point where the Scolia lays her egg.  I now place the grub upon the larva, with its head touching the bleeding  wound, and lay the whole on a bed of mould in a transparent beaker  protected by a pane of glass.    Unable to move, to wriggle, to scratch with its legs or snap with  its mandibles, the Cetonia-larva, a new Prometheus bound, offers  its defenceless flanks to the little Vulture destined to devour its  entrails. Without too much hesitation, the young Scolia settles down  to the wound made by my scalpel, which to the grub represents the wound  whence I have just removed it. It thrusts its neck into the belly of  its prey; and for a couple of days all seems to go well. Then, lo and  behold, the Cetonia turns putrid and the Scolia dies, poisoned by the  ptomaines of the decomposing game! As before, I see it turn brown and  die on the spot, still half inside the toxic corpse.    The fatal issue of my experiment is easily explained. The Cetonia-larva  is alive in every sense. True, I have, by means of bonds, suppressed its  outward movements, in order to provide the nurseling with a quiet meal,  devoid of danger; but it was not in my power to subdue its internal  movements, the quivering of the viscera and muscles irritated by its  forced immobility and by the Scolia's bites. The victim is in possession  of its full power of sensation; and it expresses the pain experienced  as best it may, by contractions. Embarrassed by these tremors, these  twitches of suffering flesh, incommoded at every mouthful, the grub  chews away at random and kills the larva almost as soon as it has  started on it. In a victim paralysed by the regulation sting, the  conditions would be very different. There are no external movements,  nor any internal movements either, when the mandibles bite, because the  victim is insensible. The grub, undisturbed in any way, is then able,  with an unfaltering tooth, to pursue its scientific method of eating.    These marvellous results interested me too much not to inspire me with  fresh devices when I pursued my investigations. Earlier enquiries had  taught me that the larvae of the Digger-wasps are fairly indifferent to  the nature of the game, though the mother always supplies them with the  same diet. I had succeeded in rearing them on a great variety of prey,  without paying regard to their normal fare. I shall return to this  subject later, when I hope to demonstrate its great philosophical  significance. Let us profit by these data and try to discover what  happens when we give the Scolia food which is not properly its own.    I select from my heap of garden-mould, that inexhaustible mine, two  larvae of the Rhinoceros Beetle, Oryctes nasicornis, about one-third  full-grown, so that their size may not be out of proportion to the  Scolia's. It is in fact almost identical with the size of the Cetonia.  I paralyse one of them by giving an injection of ammonia in the  nerve-centres. I make a fine incision in its belly and I place the  Scolia on the opening. The dish pleases my charge; and it would  be strange indeed if this were not so, considering that another  Scolia-grub, the larva of the Garden Scolia, feeds on the Oryctes.  The dish suits it, for before long it has burrowed half-way into  the succulent paunch. This time all goes well. Will the rearing be  successful? Not a bit of it! On the third day, the Oryctes decomposes  and the Scolia dies. Which shall we hold responsible for the failure,  myself or the grub? Myself who, perhaps too unskilfully, administered "]]]
