In any  case, whatever reply we give to this broad question, one thing is  certain: there can be no break in continuity between the child's  delight in games and that of the grown-up person. Now, comedy is a  game, a game that imitates life. And since, in the games of the child  when working its dolls and puppets, many of the movements are produced  by strings, ought we not to find those same strings, somewhat frayed by  wear, reappearing as the threads that knot together the situations in a  comedy? Let us, then, start with the games of a child, and follow the  imperceptible process by which, as he grows himself, he makes his  puppets grow, inspires them with life, and finally brings them to an  ambiguous state in which, without ceasing to be puppets, they have yet  become human beings. We thus obtain characters of a comedy type. And  upon them we can test the truth of the law of which all our preceding  analyses gave an inkling, a law in accordance with which we will define  all broadly comic situations in general. ANY ARRANGEMENT OF ACTS AND  EVENTS IS COMIC WHICH GIVES US, IN A SINGLE COMBINATION, THE ILLUSION  OF LIFE AND THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION OF A MECHANICAL ARRANGEMENT.    1. THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX.--As children we have all played with the little  man who springs out of his box. You squeeze him flat, he jumps up  again. Push him lower, and he shoots up still higher. Crush him down  beneath the lid, and often he will send everything flying. It is hard  to tell whether or no the toy itself is very ancient, but the kind of  amusement it affords belongs to all time. It is a struggle between two  stubborn elements, one of which, being simply mechanical, generally  ends by giving in to the other, which treats it as a plaything. A cat  playing with a mouse, which from time to time she releases like a  spring, only to pull it up short with a stroke of her paw, indulges in  the same kind of amusement.    We will now pass on to the theatre, beginning with a Punch and Judy  show. No sooner does the policeman put in an appearance on the stage  than, naturally enough, he receives a blow which fells him. He springs  to his feet, a second blow lays him flat. A repetition of the offence  is followed by a repetition of the punishment. Up and down the  constable flops and hops with the uniform rhythm of the bending and  release of a spring, whilst the spectators laugh louder and louder.    Now, let us think of a spring that is rather of a moral type, an idea  that is first expressed, then repressed, and then expressed again; a  stream of words that bursts forth, is checked, and keeps on starting  afresh. Once more we have the vision of one stubborn force,  counteracted by another, equally pertinacious. This vision, however,  will have discarded a portion of its materiality. No longer is it Punch  and Judy that we are watching, but rather a real comedy.    Many a comic scene may indeed be referred to this simple type. For  instance, in the scene of the Mariage force between Sganarelle and  Pancrace, the entire vis comica lies in the conflict set up between the  idea of Sganarelle, who wishes to make the philosopher listen to him,  and the obstinacy of the philosopher, a regular talking-machine working  automatically. As the scene progresses, the image of the  Jack-in-the-box becomes more apparent, so that at last the characters  themselves adopt its movements,--Sganarelle pushing Pancrace, each time  he shows himself, back into the wings, Pancrace returning to the stage  after each repulse to continue his patter. And when Sganarelle finally  drives Pancrace back and shuts him up inside the house--inside the box,  one is tempted to say--a window suddenly flies open, and the head of  the philosopher again appears as though it had burst open the lid of a  box.    The same by-play occurs in the Malade Imaginaire. Through the mouth of  Monsieur Purgon the outraged medical profession pours out its vials of  wrath upon Argan, threatening him with every disease that flesh is heir  to. And every time Argan rises from his seat, as though to silence  Purgon, the latter disappears for a moment, being, as it were, thrust  back into the wings; then, as though Impelled by a spring, he rebounds  on to the stage with a fresh curse on his lips. The self-same  exclamation: \"Monsieur Purgon!\" recurs at regular beats, and, as it  were, marks the TEMPO of this little scene.    Let us scrutinise more closely the image of the spring which is bent,  released, and bent again. Let us disentangle its central element, and  we shall hit upon one of the usual processes of classic  comedy,--REPETITION.    Why is it there is something comic in the repetition of a word on the  stage? No theory of the ludicrous seems to offer a satisfactory answer  to this very simple question. Nor can an answer be found so long as we  look for the explanation of an amusing word or phrase in the phrase or  word itself, apart from all it suggests to us. Nowhere will the usual  method prove to be so inadequate as here. With the exception, however,  of a few special instances to which we shall recur later, the  repetition of a word is never laughable in itself. It makes us laugh  only because it symbolises a special play of moral elements, this play  itself being the symbol of an altogether material diversion. It is the  diversion of the cat with the mouse, the diversion of the child pushing  back the Jack-in-the-box, time after time, to the bottom of his  box,--but in a refined and spiritualised form, transferred to the realm  of feelings and ideas. Let us then state the law which, we think,  defines the main comic varieties of word-repetition on the stage: IN A  COMIC REPETITION OF WORDS WE GENERALLY FIND TWO TERMS: A REPRESSED  FEELING WHICH GOES OFF LIKE A SPRING, AND AN IDEA THAT DELIGHTS IN  REPRESSING THE FEELING ANEW.    When Dorine is telling Orgon of his wife's illness, and the latter  continually interrupts him with inquiries as to the health of Tartuffe,  the question: \"Et tartuffe?\" repeated every few moments, affords us the  distinct sensation of a spring being released. This spring Dorine  delights in pushing back, each time she resumes her account of Elmire's  illness. And when Scapin informs old Geronte that his son has been  taken prisoner on the famous galley, and that a ransom must be paid  without delay, he is playing with the avarice of Geronte exactly as  Dorine does with the infatuation of Orgon. The old man's avarice is no  sooner repressed than up it springs again automatically, and it is this  automatism that Moliere tries to indicate by the mechanical repetition  of a sentence expressing regret at the money that would have to be  forthcoming: \"What the deuce did he want in that galley?\" The same  criticism is applicable to the scene in which Valere points out to  Harpagon the wrong he would be doing in marrying his daughter to a man  she did not love. \"No dowry wanted!\" interrupts the miserly Harpagon  every few moments. Behind this exclamation, which recurs automatically,  we faintly discern a complete repeating-machine set going by a fixed  idea.    At times this mechanism is less easy to detect, and here we encounter a  fresh difficulty in the theory of the comic. Sometimes the whole  interest of a scene lies in one character playing a double part, the  intervening speaker acting as a mere prism, so to speak, through which  the dual personality is developed. We run the risk, then, of going  astray if we look for the secret of the effect in what we see and  hear,--in the external scene played by the characters,--and not in the  altogether inner comedy of which this scene is no more than the outer  refraction. For instance, when Alceste stubbornly repeats the words, \"I  don't say that!\" on Oronte asking him if he thinks his poetry bad, the  repetition is laughable, though evidently Oronte is not now playing  with Alceste at the game we have just described. We must be careful,  however, for, in reality, we have two men in Alceste: on the one hand,  the \"misanthropist\" who has vowed henceforth to call a spade a spade,  and on the other the gentleman who cannot unlearn, in a trice, the  usual forms of politeness, or even, it may be, just the honest fellow  who, when called upon to put his words into practice, shrinks from  wounding another's self-esteem or hurting his feelings. Accordingly,  the real scene is not between Alceste and Oronte, it is between Alceste  and himself. The one Alceste would fain blurt out the truth, and the  other stops his mouth just as he is on the point of telling everything.  Each \"I don't say that!\" reveals a growing effort to repress something  that strives and struggles to get out. And so the tone in which the  phrase is uttered gets more and more violent, Alceste becoming more and  more angry--not with Oronte, as he thinks--but with himself. The  tension of the spring is continually being renewed and reinforced until  it at last goes off with a bang. Here, as elsewhere, we have the same  identical mechanism of repetition.    For a man to make a resolution never henceforth to say what he does not  think, even though he \"openly defy the whole human race,\" is not  necessarily laughable; it is only a phase of life at its highest and  best. For another man, through amiability, selfishness, or disdain, to  prefer to flatter people is only another phase of life; there is  nothing in it to make us laugh. You may even combine these two men into  one, and arrange that the individual waver between offensive frankness  and delusive politeness, this duel between two opposing feelings will  not even then be comic, rather it will appear the essence of  seriousness if these two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#9)"],[1,"upon his errand, for he  felt as important as a boy does when he is sent for the first time  to the corner grocery to buy a yeast cake.    \"Guk-uk-uk-uk! guk-uk-uk-uk!\" was the way he laughed; and if you  think a hippopotamus does not laugh this way you have but to listen  to one and you will find I am right.    He crawled out of the mud where he was wallowing and tramped away  through the bushes, and the last his mother heard as she lay half in  and half out of the water was his musical \"guk-uk-uk-uk!\" dying away  in the distance.    Keo was in such a happy mood that he scarcely noticed where he  stepped, so he was much surprised when, in the middle of a laugh,  the ground gave way beneath him, and he fell to the bottom of  Gouie's deep pit. He was not badly hurt, but had bumped his nose  severely as he went down; so he stopped laughing and began to think  how he should get out again. Then he found the walls were higher  than his head, and that he was a prisoner.    So he laughed a little at his own misfortune, and the laughter  soothed him to sleep, so that he snored all through the night until  daylight came.    When Gouie peered over the edge of the pit next morning he  exclaimed:    \"Why, 'tis Ippi--the Jolly One!\"    Keo recognized the scent of a black man and tried to raise his head  high enough to bite him. Seeing which Gouie spoke in the  hippopotamus language, which he had learned from his grandfather,  the sorcerer.    \"Have peace, little one; you are my captive.\"    \"Yes; I will have a piece of your leg, if I can reach it,\" retorted  Keo; and then he laughed at his own joke: \"Guk-uk-uk-uk!\"    But Gouie, being a thoughtful black man, went away without further  talk, and did not return until the following morning. When he again  leaned over the pit Keo was so weak from hunger that he could hardly  laugh at all.    \"Do you give up?\" asked Gouie, \"or do you still wish to fight?\"    \"What will happen if I give up?\" inquired Keo.    The black man scratched his woolly head in perplexity.    \"It is hard to say, Ippi. You are too young to work, and if I kill  you for food I shall lose your tusks, which are not yet grown. Why,  O Jolly One, did you fall into my hole? I wanted to catch your  mother or one of your uncles.\"    \"Guk-uk-uk-uk!\" laughed Keo. \"You must let me go, after all, black  man; for I am of no use to you!\"    \"That I will not do,\" declared Gouie; \"unless,\" he added, as an  afterthought, \"you will make a bargain with me.\"    \"Let me hear about the bargain, black one, for I am hungry,\" said  Keo.    \"I will let your go if you swear by the tusks of your grandfather  that you will return to me in a year and a day and become my  prisoner again.\"    The youthful hippopotamus paused to think, for he knew it was a  solemn thing to swear by the tusks of his grandfather; but he was  exceedingly hungry, and a year and a day seemed a long time off; so  he said, with another careless laugh:    \"Very well; if you will now let me go I swear by the tusks of my  grandfather to return to you in a year and a day and become your  prisoner.\"    Gouie was much pleased, for he knew that in a year and a day Keo  would be almost full grown. So he began digging away one end of the  pit and filling it up with the earth until he had made an incline  which would allow the hippopotamus to climb out.    Keo was so pleased when he found himself upon the surface of the  earth again that he indulged in a merry fit of laughter, after which  he said:    \"Good-by, Gouie; in a year and a day you will see me again.\"    Then he waddled away toward the river to see his mother and get his  breakfast, and Gouie returned to his village.    During the months that followed, as the black man lay in his hut or  hunted in the forest, he heard at times the faraway \"Guk-uk-uk-uk!\"  of the laughing hippopotamus. But he only smiled to himself and  thought: \"A year and a day will soon pass away!\"    Now when Keo returned to his mother safe and well every member of  his tribe was filled with joy, for the Jolly One was a general  favorite. But when he told them that in a year and a day he must  again become the slave of the black man, they began to wail and  weep, and so many were their tears that the river rose several  inches.    Of course Keo only laughed at their sorrow; but a great meeting of  the tribe was called and the matter discussed seriously.    \"Having sworn by the tusks of his grandfather,\" said Uncle Nikki,  \"he must keep his promise. But it is our duty to try in some way to  rescue him from death or a life of slavery.\"    To this all agreed, but no one could think of any method of saving  Keo from his fate. So months passed away, during which all the royal  hippopotamuses were sad and gloomy except the Jolly One himself.    Finally but a week of freedom remained to Keo, and his mother, the  queen, became so nervous and worried that another meeting of the  tribe was called. By this time the laughing hippopotamus had grown  to enormous size, and measured nearly fifteen feet long and six feet  high, while his sharp tusks were whiter and harder than those of an  elephant.    \"Unless something is done to save my child,\" said the mother, \"I  shall die of grief.\"    Then some of her relations began to make foolish suggestions; but  presently Uncle Nep, a wise and very big hippopotamus, said:    \"We must go to Glinkomok and implore his aid.\"    Then all were silent, for it was a bold thing to face the mighty  Glinkomok. But the mother's love was equal to any heroism.    \"I will myself go to him, if Uncle Nep will accompany me,\" she said,  quickly.    Uncle Nep thoughtfully patted the soft mud with his fore foot and  wagged his short tail leisurely from side to side.    \"We have always been obedient to Glinkomok, and shown him great  respect,\" said he. \"Therefore I fear no danger in facing him. I will  go with you.\"    All the others snorted approval, being very glad they were not  called upon to go themselves.    So the queen and Uncle Nep, with Keo swimming between them, set out  upon their journey. They swam up the river all that day and all the  next, until they came at sundown to a high, rocky wall, beneath  which was the cave where the might Glinkomok dwelt.    This fearful creature was part beast, part man, part fowl and part  fish. It had lived since the world began. Through years of wisdom it  had become part sorcerer, part wizard, part magician and part fairy.  Mankind knew it not, but the ancient beasts knew and feared it.    The three hippopotamuses paused before the cave, with their front  feet upon the bank and their bodies in the water, and called in  chorus a greeting to Glinkomok. Instantly thereafter the mouth of  the cave darkened and the creature glided silently toward them.    The hippopotamuses were afraid to look upon it, and bowed their  heads between their legs.    \"We come, O Glinkomok, to implore your mercy and friendly  assistance!\" began Uncle Nep; and then he told the story of Keo's  capture, and how he had promised to return to the black man.    \"He must keep his promise,\" said the creature, in a voice that  sounded like a sigh.    The mother hippopotamus groaned aloud.    \"But I will prepare him to overcome the black man, and to regain his  liberty,\" continued Glinkomok.    Keo laughed.    \"Lift your right paw,\" commanded Glinkomok. Keo obeyed, and the  creature touched it with its long, hairy tongue. Then it held four  skinny hands over Keo's bowed head and mumbled some words in a  language unknown to man or beast or fowl or fish. After this it  spoke again in hippopotamese:    \"Your skin has now become so tough that no man can hurt you. Your  strength is greater than that of ten elephants. Your foot is so  swift that you can distance the wind. Your wit is sharper than the  bulthorn. Let the man fear, but drive fear from your own breast  forever; for of all your race you are the mightiest!\"    Then the terrible Glinkomok leaned over, and Keo felt its fiery  breath scorch him as it whispered some further instructions in his  ear. The next moment it glided back into its cave, followed by the  loud thanks of the three hippopotamuses, who slid into the water and  immediately began their journey home.    The mother's heart was full of joy; Uncle Nep shivered once or twice  as he remembered a glimpse he had caught of Glinkomok; but Keo was  as jolly as possible, and, not content to swim with his dignified  elders, he dived under their bodies, raced all around them and  laughed merrily every inch of the way home.    Then all the tribe held high jinks and praised the mighty Glinkomok  for befriending their queen's son. And when the day came for the  Jolly One to give himself up to the black man they all kissed him  good-by without a single fear for his safety.    Keo went away in good spirits, and they could hear his laughing  \"guk-uk-uk-uk!\" long after he was lost in sight in the jungle.    Gouie had counted the days and knew when to expect Keo; but he was  astonished at the monstrous size to which his captive had grown, and  congratulated himself on the wise bargain he had made. And Keo was  so fat that Gouie determined to eat him--that is, all of him he  possibly could, and the remainder of the carcass he would trade off  to his fellow villagers.    So he took a knife and tried to stick it into the hippopotamus, but  the skin was so tough the knife was blunted against it. Then he  tried other means; but Keo remained unhurt.    And now indeed the Jolly One laughed his most gleeful laugh, till  all the forest echoed the \"guk-uk-uk-uk-uk!\" And Gouie decided not  to kill him, since that was impossible, but to use him for a beast  of burden. He mounted upon Keo's back and commanded him to march. So  Keo trotted briskly through the village, his little eyes twinkling  with merriment.    The other blacks were delighted with Gouie's captive, and begged  permission to ride upon the Jolly One's back. So Gouie"]]]
