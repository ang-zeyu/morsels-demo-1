On the Reservation there are many old logs, and  snags still standing, of mature black oaks long dead. Earlier drought  periods such as those of 1936-37 and 1925-26 possibly were also times  of unusually heavy mortality. In any case it seems clear that this oak  was originally more prominent in the woodlands than it is at present,  and has been steadily losing ground. Even where the mature trees  remain in greatest numbers the saplings are relatively scarce as  compared with those of elm, ash, hackberry, and hickory. The  westernmost limits of the range are nearly 100 miles west of the  Reservation.    Black oak provides a mast crop which is utilized by various small  mammals, notably squirrels and white-footed mice. Gray squirrels have  often been noticed in or about these trees. Hairy woodpeckers  (_Dendrocopos villosus_), black and white warblers (_Mniotilta  varia_), and brown creepers (_Certhia familiaris_) have often been  noticed foraging on the trunks. Blue jays, myrtle warblers (_Dendroica  coronata_), tufted titmice, and summer tanagers frequently forage  through the crowns. Often black oak trunks are hollow and the cavities  are utilized by various birds and mammals including the screech owl  (_Otus asio_), barred owl, raccoon, opossum, fox squirrel, gray  squirrel, woodrat, and white-footed mouse.      #Quercus marilandica.#--Black Jack oak is localized in four small  compact groves on the Reservation. These sites, though well separated,  are similar. All are on steep lower slopes, where there is dry rocky  clay soil and the exposure is mainly south. Probably all four groves  date back to the time when the area was still in an undisturbed state.  Originally they were perhaps largely separated from the remainder of  the woodland. Black Jack oak is more tolerant of heat and drought than  most of the other hardwoods are. The species is intolerant of fire,  but perhaps was partly protected under original conditions by the  sparseness of herbaceous vegetation on the poor soil where the groves  were situated.    These oaks are relatively slow-growing. One stump of 9-inch diameter,  typical of the larger Black Jack trees, had approximately 60 annual  rings. Under present conditions there is little or no reproduction and  these trees are dying out as a result of competition by other  hardwoods. Under protection from fire and browsing, elms, other oaks,  locust and dogwood have closed in about the groves and seem to be  shading them out.    There are several mature oaks of anomalous appearance, in different  places within a few hundred feet at most of the groves of Black Jack.  Most of these appear to be hybrids between the present species and _Q.  velutina_, as they are somewhat intermediate in size, bark texture,  and leaves.    This oak produces a mast crop used by various birds and mammals, and  groves are frequented by blue jays, fox squirrels, white-footed mice  and woodrats. In the mid-forties when the woodrat population was high,  there were many of the rats' stick houses in the groves, built either  at the bases of the trunks or among the dense branchlets in tops of  fallen trees. By 1952 the population of woodrats was much reduced and  had disappeared entirely from these groves. The houses were collapsed  and decaying.    Horned owls (_Bubo virginianus_) and barred owls often make their day  roosts among the dense interlacing twigs of these trees, and  red-tailed hawks have been known to roost for the night in the same  kinds of situations.      #Ulmus americana.#--On most parts of the area American elm is the  dominant tree. It occurs throughout the woodland, and most of the  larger trees are of this species. In each of the fields that were  formerly cultivated, and in the pasture areas, there are many  saplings. More than one hundred elms of DBH two feet or more have been  recorded. Presumably these mostly date back 90 years or more and were  already growing on the area when it was relatively undisturbed. On the  area the distribution of these large elms corresponds in a general way  with the present distribution of the oak-hickory type. The coinciding  distribution of the climax species and of the largest trees is  believed to reflect the distribution pattern of the original forest,  except that clearing was thorough in the bottomlands so that hardly  any trees of the climax species, or large trees of any kind remain.  Several elms of three feet or more DBH were recorded, and the largest  one measured was 46 inches. The largest elms are in alluvial soil near  small creeks in the two valleys. Also many large elms grow along the  upper slopes, especially along the outcrops of the two main strata of  the Oread Limestone. Such sites along the outcrops on open slopes are  the first to be invaded. The rock strata are relatively impervious to  water, which is held at a depth where it is readily available to the  trees. Along rocky upper slopes between the two outcrops, where  chestnut oak is abundant, elms are relatively scarce and seem unable  to compete successfully. It is noteworthy that elm is not mentioned in  several of the descriptions (Taft, 1950; Parks, 1854; Robinson, 1899)  of the original forest, even in listings of the species present. It  must have been much less prominent until favored by disturbed  conditions.      [Illustration: Fig. 7. Map of Reservation showing present        distribution of the largest American elms, those more than two        feet in trunk diameter. American elm is increasing and spreading        on the area, and smaller trees are abundant even in former        cultivated fields and pastures. Growth rate varies according to        site, but these larger trees are, in many instances, 90 years or        more in age and most of them are thought to be in the area        wooded in the eighteen sixties and before.]    In July and August, 1954, a large proportion of the elms on the area  died. The die-off included trees of all sizes, and evidently the  cumulative effect of drought in 1952 and 1953, continuing into the  spring and summer of 1954, was the primary cause, although  diseases such as phloem necrosis, and insect infestations, may have  intensified its effect. In August of 1954 the bare dead elms stood out  conspicuously in the mass of green foliage surrounding them. Most of  them had survived the two dry summers of 1952 and 1953 with little  evident loss in vitality. However, the continued lack of moisture as  the 1954 growing season progressed, and the extremely hot weather of  June and July caused heavy mortality. In the course of a few days the  foliage of the upper branches would wither, die and turn brown. In  some instances numerous sucker shoots grew from the trunk of the tree  as the top was dying. Mortality was especially heavy on south-facing  slopes. Certain ecologists believe that over the years, as trees  deplete subsoil moisture and periodic droughts make their effects  felt, other species also will die off and eventually prairie will  replace them where the present forests are growing in dry and exposed  situations.    Infestations of the introduced bark beetle, _Scolytus multistriatus_,  were common and probably contributed to death of many elms. In the  winter of 1953-54 before much mortality had occurred, the bark beetle  infestations had become conspicuous. Especially on south slopes elms  of about six inches DBH were heavily infested. Woodpeckers, including  the downy, hairy, and red-bellied, habitually resorted to the elm  trunks to forage. As a result of their activities chips of bark  accumulated sometimes to a depth of several inches around the bases of  the trunks, and the exposed inner layers of brown bark caused the  infested trees to contrast with the predominantly gray color of those  that were still healthy and retained the outer layer of bark.    In April and early May seeds of the American elm constitute a major  food source for birds, including the black-capped chickadee, tufted  titmouse, junco (_Junco hyemalis_), red-eyed towhee (_Pipilo  erythrophthalmus_), Harris sparrow (_Zonotrichia querula_), cardinal,  goldfinch, tree sparrow (_Spizella arborea_) and field sparrow (_S.  pusilla_). Birds recorded as nesting in the American elm include the  mourning dove (_Zenaidura macroura_), Cooper hawk, red-tailed hawk,  broad-winged hawk (_Buteo platypterus_), turkey vulture (_Cathartes  aura_), screech owl, horned owl, barred owl, red-bellied woodpecker,  downy woodpecker, tufted titmouse, black-capped chickadee,  gnatcatcher, red-eyed vireo, summer tanager, indigo bunting  (_Passerina cyanea_), field sparrow and cardinal.    Opossums, raccoons, fox squirrels and white-footed mice often live in  cavities in elms.    Insectivorous birds that find their food on foliage and prefer elm or  use it to a large extent are: yellow-billed cuckoo, tufted titmouse,  black-capped chickadee, blue-gray gnatcatcher, red-eyed vireo,  white-eyed vireo and warblers, including the myrtle, Audubon  (_Dendroica auduboni_), yellow (_D. petechia_), black-throated green  (_D. virens_), black-poll (_D. striata_), Tennessee (_Vermivora  peregrina_), orange-crowned (_V. celata_), Nashville (_V.  ruficapilla_) and American redstart (_Setophaga ruticilla_).      #Ulmus rubra.#--The red elm (or slippery elm) is widely distributed  over the area, but only a few trees with a trunk diameter of twelve  inches or more are present. Throughout the woodlands of the  Reservation the saplings of this species constitute a prominent part  of the understory. However, few survive beyond the sapling stage. The  red elm is never abundant in Kansas woodlands. It is intolerant of  drought conditions, and is one of the first trees to die. This fact  probably explains the scarcity of mature trees of this species on the  Reservation.      #Celtis occidentalis.#--Hackberry is widely distributed on the area,  but is not dominant anywhere."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34376"],[0,"Our Domestic Birds: Elementary Lessons in Aviculture (#9)"],[1,"methods that had been used for  centuries.    [Illustration: Fig. 22. Black Langshan cock. (Photograph from Urban  Farms, Buffalo, New York)]    =Modern conditions and methods.= About a hundred years ago people in  England and America began to give more attention to poultry keeping, and  to study how to make poultry (especially fowls) more profitable. This  interest in poultry arose partly because of the increasing interest in  agricultural matters and partly because eggs and poultry were becoming  more important articles of food. Those who studied the situation found  that there were two ways of making poultry more profitable. One way,  which was open to all, was to give the birds better care; the other was  to replace the ordinary fowls with fowls of an improved breed. So those  who were much interested began to follow the practices of the most  successful poultry keepers that they knew, and to introduce new breeds,  and gradually great changes were made in the methods of producing  poultry and in the types of fowls that were kept in places where the  interest in poultry was marked.    Nearly all farmers now keep quite large flocks of fowls. Many farmers  make the most of their living from poultry, and in some places nearly  every farm is devoted primarily to the production of eggs and of poultry  for the table. Fowls receive most attention, although, as we shall see,  some of the largest and most profitable farms are engaged in producing  ducks. In the suburbs of cities and in villages all over the land many  people keep more fowls now than the average farmer did in old times.  These city poultry keepers often give a great deal of time to their  fowls and still either lose money on them or make very small wages for  the time given to this work, because they try to keep too many in a  small space, or to keep more than they have time to care for properly.    [Illustration: Fig. 23. Black Langshan hen. (Photograph from Urban  Farms, Buffalo, New York)]    The breeding of fancy fowls is also an important pursuit. Those who  engage in this line on a large scale locate on farms, but many of the  smaller breeders live in towns, and the greater number of the amateur  fanciers who breed fine fowls for pleasure are city people.    On large poultry farms the work is usually done by men. There are many  small plants operated by women. The ordinary farm and family flocks are  cared for by women and children much oftener than by men, because, even  when the men are interested in poultry, other work takes the farmer away  from the vicinity of the house, and the city man away from home, so much  that they cannot look after poultry as closely as is necessary to get  the best results. Many women like to have the care of a small flock of  fowls, because it takes them outdoors for a few minutes at intervals  every day, and the eggs and poultry sold may bring in a considerable  amount of pin money. Many boys, while attending the grammar and high  schools, earn money by keeping a flock of fowls. Some have saved enough  in this way to pay expenses at college for a year or more, or to give  them a start in a small business. When there are both boys and girls in  a family, such outdoor work usually falls to the lot of a boy. A girl  can do just as well if she has the opportunity and takes an interest in  the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 24. Pit Game cock. (Photograph from W. F. Liedtke,  Meriden, Connecticut)]    =Native fowls in America.= To appreciate the influence of improved races  of fowls from various parts of the Old World upon the development of  poultry culture in America, we must know what the fowls in this country  were like when poultry keepers here began to see the advantages of  keeping better stock, and must learn something of the history of the  improved races in the countries from which they came.    [Illustration: Fig. 25. Dominique cockerel. (Photograph from W. H.  Davenport, Coleraine, Massachusetts)]    When we speak of native fowls in America we mean fowls derived from the  stocks brought here by the early settlers. The fowl was not known in the  Western Hemisphere until it was brought here by Europeans. Britain,  France, Spain, Holland, and Sweden all sent colonists to America, and  from each of these countries came, no doubt, some of the ordinary fowls  of that country. Perhaps improved varieties came from some of these  lands in early colonial times, but the only breeds that retained their  identity sufficiently to have distinctive names were the Game Fowls,  which came mostly from England, and the Dominiques (bluish-gray barred  fowls which probably came from Holland or from the north of France,  where fowls of this type were common).    [Illustration: Fig. 26. Dominique hen. (Photograph from Skerritt and  Son, Utica, New York)]    The Game Fowls, being prized for the sport of cockfighting, were often  bred with great care, but the Dominique fowls (also called cuckoo fowls  and hawk-colored fowls) were mixed with other stock, and the name was  commonly given to any fowl of that color, until after the improvement  of fowls began. Then some people collected flocks of fowls of this color  and bred them for uniformity in other characters. Well-bred fowls,  however, were comparatively rare. Most of the stock all through the  country was of the little mongrel type until about the middle of the  last century. Then that type began to disappear from New England, New  York, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. It remained longer in the  Northern states west of the Allegheny Mountains and a generation ago was  still the most common type in the upper Mississippi Valley. It is now  unknown outside of the Southern states, and within ten or twenty years  it will disappear entirely.    [Illustration: Fig. 27. Silver-Gray Dorking cock]    [Illustration: Fig. 28. Silver-Gray Dorking hen]    =Old European races of fowls.= With the exception of the Leghorn, most  of the distinct breeds of European origin were brought from England, and  the types introduced were not the types as developed in the places  where the breeds (other than English breeds) originated, but those  types as modified by English fanciers. In America, again, most of these  breeds have been slightly changed to conform to the ideas of American  fanciers. So, while the breed characters are still the same as in the  original stocks, the pupil looking at birds of these breeds to-day must  not suppose that it was just such birds that came to this country from  seventy to a hundred years ago, or that, if he went to the countries  where those races originated, he would find birds just like those he had  seen at home. Except in the case of the distinctly English breeds, such  as the Dorking and the Cornish Indian Game, which are bred to greater  perfection in their native land than elsewhere, he would find most of  the European races not so highly developed in the countries where they  originated as in England and America, where fanciers are more numerous.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Single-Comb Brown Leghorn cockerel. (Photograph  from Grove Hill Poultry Yards, Waltham, Massachusetts)]    [Illustration: Fig. 30. Rose-Comb Buff Leghorn hen. (Photograph from H.  J. Fisk, Falconer, New York)]    =Italian fowls.= Strictly speaking, the Italian fowls in Italy are not  an improved race. The fowl which is known in this country as the Leghorn  fowl (because the first specimens brought here came from the port of  Leghorn) is the common fowl of Italy and has changed very little since  it was introduced into that country thousands of years ago. It is found  there in all colors, and mostly with a single comb. The Italian type is  of particular interest, not only because of its influence in modern  times, but because from it were probably derived most of the other  European races. Italian fowls were first brought to this country about  1835, but did not attract popular attention until twenty-five or thirty  years later.    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Silver-Spangled Hamburg cock[3]]    [Illustration: Fig. 32. Silver-Spangled Hamburg hen[3]]    [3] Photograph from Dr. J. S. Wolfe, Bloomfield, New Jersey.    =English races of fowls.= It is supposed that fowls were introduced into  Britain from Italy shortly after the Roman conquest. The type was  probably very like that of ordinary Leghorn fowls of our own time, but  with smaller combs. From such stock the English developed two very  different races, the Pit Game and the Dorking. Game fowls were bred in  all parts of the kingdom, but the Dorkings were a local breed developed  by the people in the vicinity of the town of Dorking, where from very  early times the growing of poultry for the London market was an  important local industry. Each in its way, these two breeds represent  the highest skill in breeding. In the Old English Game Fowl, symmetry,  strength, endurance, and courage were combined to perfection. The  Dorking is the finest type of table fowl that has ever been produced.    [Illustration: Fig. 33. White-Crested Black Polish cock[4]]    [Illustration: Fig. 34. White-Crested Black Polish hen[4]]    [4] Photograph from Charles L. Seely, Afton, New York.    =German and Dutch races.= The breeds now known as Hamburgs and Polish  are of peculiar interest to a student of the evolution of races of  fowls, because they present some characters not readily derived from the  primitive type of the fowl. The feather markings of some varieties of  both these breeds are unlike those of other races, and are markings  which would not be likely to become established unless the fowls were  bred systematically for that purpose. So, too, with the large crest of  the Polish fowl: to carry it the structure of the head must be changed.  Such changes require systematic breeding for a long period. Dutch and  German artists of the sixteenth century painted many farmyard scenes  showing fowls of both these types, frequently in flocks with common"]]]
