Livingston had already made some  unsuccessful experiments with the steamboat in the United States, and,  in 1798, had received the monopoly of steam navigation on the waters  of New York for twenty years, provided that he produced a vessel within  twelve months able to steam four miles an hour. This grant had, of  course, been forfeited, but might be renewed, Livingston thought.    Fulton and Livingston met, probably at Barlow's house, and, in 1802,  drew up an agreement to construct a steamboat to ply between New York  and Albany. Livingston agreed to advance five hundred dollars for  experimentation in Europe. In this same year Fulton built a model and  tested different means of propulsion, giving \"the preference to a wheel  on each side of the model.\"* The boat was built on the Seine, but proved  too frail for the borrowed engine. A second boat was tried in August,  1803, and moved, though at a disappointingly slow rate of speed.         * Fulton to Barlow, quoted in Sutcliffe, \"Robert Fulton and       the Clermont\", p. 124.    Just at this time Fulton wrote ordering an engine from Boulton and Watt  to be transported to America. The order was at first refused, as it was  then the shortsighted policy of the British Government to maintain a  monopoly of mechanical contrivances. Permission to export was given the  next year, however, and the engine was shipped in 1805. It lay for some  time in the New York Customs House. Meanwhile Fulton had studied the  Watt engine on Symington's steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas, on the  Forth and Clyde Canal, and Livingston had been granted a renewal of his  monopoly of the waters of New York.    Fulton arrived at New York in 1806 and began the construction of the  Clermont, so named after Livingston's estate on the Hudson. The building  was done on the East River. The boat excited the jeers of passersby, who  called it \"Fulton's Folly.\" On Monday, August 17, 1807, the memorable  first voyage was begun. Carrying a party of invited guests, the Clermont  steamed off at one o'clock. Past the towns and villages along the  Hudson, the boat moved steadily, black smoke rolling from her stack.  Pine wood was the fuel. During the night, the sparks pouring from her  funnel, the clanking of her machinery, and the splashing of the paddles  frightened the animals in the woods and the occupants of the scattered  houses along the banks. At one o'clock Tuesday the boat arrived at  Clermont, 110 miles from New York. After spending the night at Clermont,  the voyage was resumed on Wednesday. Albany, forty miles away, was  reached in eight hours, making a record of 150 miles in thirty-two  hours. Returning to New York, the distance was covered in thirty hours.  The steamboat was a success.    The boat was then laid up for two weeks while the cabins were boarded  in, a roof built over the engine, and coverings placed over the  paddle-wheels to catch the spray--all under Fulton's eye. Then the  Clermont began regular trips to Albany, carrying sometimes a hundred  passengers, making the round trip every four days, and continued until  floating ice marked the end of navigation for the winter.    Why had Fulton succeeded where others had failed? There was nothing  new in his boat. Every essential feature of the Clermont had been  anticipated by one or other of the numerous experimenters before him.  The answer seems to be that he was a better engineer than any of them.  He had calculated proportions, and his hull and his engine were in  relation. Then too, he had one of Watt's engines, undoubtedly the best  at the time, and the unwavering support of Robert Livingston.    Fulton's restless mind was never still, but he did not turn capriciously  from one idea to another. Though never satisfied, his new ideas were  tested scientifically and the results carefully written down. Some  of his notebooks read almost like geometrical demonstrations; and his  drawings and plans were beautifully executed. Before his death in 1815  he had constructed or planned sixteen or seventeen boats, including  boats for the Hudson, Potomac, and Mississippi rivers, for the Neva in  Russia, and a steam vessel of war for the United States. He was a member  of the commission on the Erie Canal, though he did not live to see that  enterprise begun.    The mighty influence of the steamboat in the development of inland  America is told elsewhere in this Series.* The steamboat has long since  grown to greatness, but it is well to remember that the true ancestor  of the magnificent leviathan of our own day is the Clermont of Robert  Fulton.         * Archer B. Hulbert, \"The Paths of Inland Commerce\".    The world today is on the eve of another great development in  transportation, quite as revolutionary as any that have preceded. How  soon will it take place? How long before Kipling's vision in \"The Night  Mail\" becomes a full reality? How long before the air craft comes to  play a great role in the world's transportation? We cannot tell. But,  after looking at the nearest parallel in the facts of history, each of  us may make his own guess. The airship appears now to be much farther  advanced than the steamboat was for many years after Robert Fulton died.  Already we have seen men ride the wind above the sea from the New World  to the Old. Already United States mails are regularly carried through  the air from the Atlantic to the Golden Gate. It was twelve years after  the birth of Fulton's Clermont, and four years after the inventor's  death, before any vessel tried to cross the Atlantic under steam. This  was in 1819, when the sailing packet Savannah, equipped with a ninety  horsepower horizontal engine and paddle-wheels, crossed from Savannah to  Liverpool in twenty-five days, during eighteen of which she used steam  power. The following year, however, the engine was taken out of the  craft. And it was not until 1833 that a real steamship crossed the  Atlantic. This time it was the Royal William, which made a successful  passage from Quebec to London. Four years more passed before the Great  Western was launched at Bristol, the first steamship to be especially  designed for transatlantic service, and the era of great steam liners  began.      If steam could be made to drive a boat on the water, why not a wagon on  the land?    History, seeking origins, often has difficulty when it attempts to  discover the precise origin of an idea. \"It frequently happens,\"  said Oliver Evans, \"that two persons, reasoning right on a mechanical  subject, think alike and invent the same thing without any communication  with each other.\"* It is certain, however, that one of the first, if not  the first, protagonist of the locomotive in America was the same Oliver  Evans, a truly great inventor for whom the world was not quite ready.  The world has forgotten him. But he was the first engine builder in  America, and one of the best of his day. He gave to his countrymen the  high-pressure steam engine and new machinery for manufacturing flour  that was not superseded for a hundred years.         * Coleman Sellers, \"Oliver Evans and His Inventions,\"       \"Journal of the Franklin Institute\", July, 1886: vol. CXXII,       p. 16.      \"Evans was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to a wheelwright. He was a  thoughtful, studious boy, who devoured eagerly the few books to which  he had access, even by the light of a fire of shavings, when denied  a candle by his parsimonious master. He says that in 1779, when only  seventeen years old, he began to contrive some method of propelling land  carriages by other means than animal power; and that he thought of a  variety of devices, such as using the force of the wind and treadles  worked by men; but as they were evidently inadequate, was about to give  up the problem as unsolvable for want of a suitable source of power,  when he heard that some neighboring blacksmith's boys had stopped up the  touch-hole of a gun barrel, put in some water, rammed down a tight wad,  and, putting the breech into the smith's fire, the gun had discharged  itself with a report like that of gunpowder. This immediately suggested  to his fertile mind a new source of power, and he labored long to  apply it, but without success, until there fell into his hands a book  describing the old atmospheric steam engine of Newcomen, and he was at  once struck with the fact that steam was only used to produce a vacuum  while to him it seemed clear that the elastic power of the steam if  applied directly to moving the piston, would be far more efficient.  He soon satisfied himself that he could make steam wagons, but could  convince no one else of this possibility.\"*         * Coleman Sellers, \"Oliver Evans and His Inventions,\"       \"Journal of the Franklin Institute\", July, 1886: vol. CXXII,       p. 3.      Evans was then living in Delaware, where he was born, and where he later  worked out his inventions in flour-milling machinery and invented and  put into service the high-pressure steam engine. He appears to have  moved to Philadelphia about 1790, the year of Franklin's death and of  the Federal Patent Act; and, as we have seen, the third patent issued  by the Government at Philadelphia was granted to him. About this time he  became absorbed in the hard work of writing a book, the \"Millwright and  Miller's Guide\", which he published in 1795, but at a heavy sacrifice  to himself in time and money. A few years later he had an established  engine works in Philadelphia and was making steam engines of his own  type that performed their work satisfactorily.    The Oruktor Amphibolos, or Amphibious Digger, which came out of his shop  in 1804, was a steamdriven machine made to the order of the Philadelphia  Board of Health for dredging and cleaning the docks of the city. It was  designed, as its name suggests, for service either in water or on shore.  It propelled itself across the city to the river front, puffing and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#9)"],[1,"e. I had beforehand prepared this      little piece, as I guessed by the appearance of the weather in the      afternoon we should have no stars to look at. This being accepted      with great pleasure, I had the lamps lighted up which illuminated      the picture of a _Saturn_ (cut out in pasteboard) at the bottom of      the garden wall. The effect was fine, and so natural that the best      astronomer might have been deceived. Their royal highnesses and      other ladies seemed to be much pleased with the artifice.        \"I remained in the queen's apartment with the ladies till about half      after ten; when in conversation with them I found them extremely      well instructed in every subject that was introduced, and they      seemed to be most amiable characters. To-morrow evening they hope to      have better luck, and nothing will give me greater happiness than to      be able to show them some of those beautiful objects with which the      heavens are so gloriously ornamented.\"    CAROLINA'S diary goes on:        \"Sir WILLIAM WATSON returned to Bath after a fort-night or three      weeks' stay. From him we heard that my brother was invited to      Greenwich with the telescope, where he was met by a numerous party      of astronomical and learned gentlemen, and trials of his instrument      were made. In these letters he complained of being obliged to lead      an idle life, having nothing to do but to pass between London and      Greenwich. Sir WILLIAM received many letters, which he was so kind      as to communicate to us. By these, and from those to ALEXANDER or to      me, we learned that the king wished to see the telescope at Windsor.      At last a letter, dated July 2, arrived from THERESE, and from this      and several succeeding ones we gathered that the king would not      suffer my brother to return to his profession again, and by his      writing several times for a supply of money we could only suppose      that he himself was in uncertainty about the time of his return.        \"In the last week of July my brother came home, and immediately      prepared for removing to Datchet, where he had taken a house with a      garden and grass-plat annexed, quite suitable for the purpose of an      observing-place. Sir WILLIAM WATSON spent nearly the whole time at      our house, and he was not the only friend who truly grieved at my      brother's going from Bath; or feared his having perhaps agreed to no      very advantageous offers; their fears were, in fact, not without      reason. . . . The prospect of entering again on the toils of teaching,      etc., which awaited my brother at home (the months of leisure being      now almost gone by), appeared to him an intolerable waste of time,      and by way of alternative he chose to be royal astronomer, with a      salary of L200 a year. Sir WILLIAM WATSON was the only one to whom      the sum was mentioned, and he exclaimed, 'Never bought monarch honor      so cheap!' To every other inquirer, my brother's answer was that the      king had provided for him.\"    On the 1st of August, 1782, the family removed to Datchet. The last  musical duty was performed on Whit-Sunday, 1782, in St. Margaret's  Chapel, Bath, when the anthem for the day was of HERSCHEL'S own  composition.    The end of the introductory epoch of his life is reached. Henceforth he  lived in his observatory, and from his forty-fourth year onwards he only  left it for short periods to go to London to submit his classic memoirs  to the Royal Society. Even for these occasions he chose periods of  moonlight, when no observations could be made.    He was a private man no longer. Henceforth he belongs to the whole  world.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] Probably on the model of one of SHORT'S Gregorian  telescopes, which were then the best instruments of the kind.    [11] For a description of the main points of HERSCHEL'S  processes of making reflectors, which will illustrate his strong  mechanical talents, see _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, eighth edition,  article _Telescope_.    [12] These have never been published, nor is it likely at this  day, when our measuring instruments are so greatly improved, that they  would be of any material value to science, although of interest as  giving the proofs of HERSCHEL'S assiduity and skill. He was always more  than the maker of telescopes, for he was never content until they were  applied to the problems of astronomy.    [13] ARAGO has implied that if HERSCHEL had directed his  telescope to _Uranus_ only eleven days earlier than he did, this  discovery would have escaped him, since at that time (March 2, 1781) the  planet was at its _station_, and had no motion relative to the star.  This is an entire misconception, since the new planet was detected by  its physical appearance, and not by its motion. Does any one suppose  that \"a new and singular star\" like this would have been once viewed and  then forgotten?    [14] Four of _Jupiter_, one of the earth, and one of _Saturn_.    [15] JOHN MICHELL had been a member of the Royal Society since  1760: he died in 1793. He was a philosophical thinker, as is shown by  his memoirs on the distances of the stars, and by his invention of the  method for determining the earth's density. It is not certain that he  was personally known to HERSCHEL, although his writings were familiar to  the latter.    ALEXANDER WILSON was Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow, and is chiefly  known to us by his theory of the nature of the solar spots, which was  adopted and enlarged by HERSCHEL. He died in 1786; but the families of  WILSON and HERSCHEL remained close friends.    [16] _Berliner Jahrbuch_, 1784, p. 211. In the _Connaissance  des Tems_ for 1784 he is called \"HOROCHELLE.\"    [17] At the presentation Sir JOSEPH BANKS, the President of the  Royal Society, said: \"In the name of the Royal Society I present to you  this gold medal, the reward which they have assigned to your successful  labors, and I exhort you to continue diligently to cultivate those  fields of science which have produced to you a harvest of so much honor.  Your attention to the improvement of telescopes has already amply repaid  the labor which you have bestowed upon them; but the treasures of the  heavens are well known to be inexhaustible. Who can say but your new  star, which exceeds _Saturn_ in its distance from the sun, may exceed  him as much in magnificence of attendance? Who knows what new rings, new  satellites, or what other nameless and numberless phenomena remain  behind, waiting to reward future industry and improvement?\"                                       CHAPTER III.                LIFE AT DATCHET, CLAY HALL, AND SLOUGH; 1782-1822.      The new house at Datchet, which was occupied from 1782 till 1785, was a  source of despair to CAROLINA HERSCHEL, who looked upon its desolate and  isolated condition with a housekeeper's eyes. This was nothing to her  brother, who gayly consented to live upon \"eggs and bacon,\" now that he  was free at last to mind the heavens. The ruinous state of the place had  no terrors in his eyes, for was there not a laundry which would serve as  a library, a large stable which was just the place for the grinding of  mirrors, and a grass-plat for the small twenty-foot reflector?    Here they set to work at astronomy; the brother with the twenty-foot,  the sister aiding him, and at odd times sweeping for comets. In the  course of her life she discovered no less than eight, and five of these  were first seen by her.           *       *       *       *       *    In 1787 HERSCHEL wrote his paper \"On three Volcanoes in the Moon,\"  which he had observed in April of that year. In this he mentions  previous observations of the same sort. I do not remember that the  following account of these has ever been put on record in English.  Baron VON ZACH writes from London to BODE:[18]        \"Probably you have heard also of the volcanoes in the moon, which      HERSCHEL has observed. . . . I will give you an account of it as I      heard it from his own lips. Dr. LIND, a worthy physician in Windsor,      who has made himself known through his two journeys in China, and      who is a friend of our HERSCHEL'S, was with his wife one evening on      a visit to HERSCHEL in Datchet [1783, May 4]. On this evening there      was to be an occultation of a star at the moon's dark limb. This was      observed by HERSCHEL and Doctor LIND. Mrs. LIND wished also to see      what was occurring, and placed herself at a telescope and watched      attentively.        \"Scarcely had the star disappeared before Mrs. LIND thought she saw      it again, and exclaimed that the star had gone in front of, and not      behind the moon. This provoked a short astronomical lecture on the      question, but still she would not credit it, because she _saw_      differently. Finally HERSCHEL stepped to the telescope, and in fact      he saw a bright point on the dark disc of the moon, which he      followed attentively. It gradually became fainter and finally      vanished.\". . .    The life at Datchet was not free from its annoyances.        \"Much of my brother's time was taken up in going, when the evenings      were clear, to the queen's lodge, to show the king, etc., objects      through the seven-foot. But when the days began to shorten, this was      found impossible, for the telescope was often (at no small expense      and risk of damage) obliged to be transported in the dark back to      Datchet, for the purpose of spending the rest of the night with      observations on double stars for a second catalogue. My brother was,      besides, obliged to be absent for a week or ten days, for the      purpose of bringing home the metal of the cracked thirty-foot      mirror, and the remaining materials from his work-room. Before the      furnace was taken down at Bath, a second twenty-foot mirror, twelve      inches diameter, was cast, which happened to be very"]]]
