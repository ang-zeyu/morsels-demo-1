[Illustration: FIG. 13. Graphs of the condylobasilar lengths, body  lengths and weights of a series of voles of known age. Within each age  group, the youngest vole is on the left in the graphs.]    When other cranial measurements, and ratios of pairs of measurements,  were plotted in the same order, individual variation obscured some of  the variation due to age and the curves resembled those of weight and  length of body rather than that of condylobasilar length. When the  cranial measurements were averaged for the age groups the curves showed  a relationship to age but the relationship of mean measurements is of  little use in determining the age of individual specimens. The data  described above indicated that a study of the relationship of the  condylobasilar length and age in a large sample might provide useful  information.    Anyone who has examined mammalian skulls knows of many other characters  which vary with age but which are difficult to measure and describe with  precision. Figs 14 and 15 are drawings of skulls of voles of known age.  The most obvious change, related to aging, evident in the dorsal view of  the skulls (Fig. 14) is the increasing prominence and closer  approximation of the temporal ridges in older specimens. The lambdoidal  ridge is also more prominent in older voles, and their skulls have a  generally rougher and more angular appearance. The individual variation  evident in these ridges is probably due to variations in the development  of the muscles operating the jaws (Howell, 1924:1003). There is an  increased flattening of the roof of the skull of older voles.    [Illustration: 1-1/2 months 2-1/2 months 3 months 3-1/2 months    4 months 4-1/2 months 6 months 12 months    All x 3.

Palatal views of skulls of voles of known age.]    From a palatal view (Fig. 15) the skulls of voles also showed age  variation which was apparent but not easily correlated with precise age.  The median ridge on the basioccipital bone increases in prominence in  older voles. The shape of the posterior margin of the palatine bones  changes from a V-shape to a U-shape. On the skull of the oldest (12  months) vole the pterygoid processes are firmly fused to the bullae, a  condition not found in any of the other specimens. The anterior spine of  the palatine approaches the posterior projection of the premaxillae more  closely as age increases and, in the oldest vole is firmly attached and  forms a complete partition separating the incisive foramina.    Tooth wear during the life of a vole causes a considerable variation in  the enamel patterns, especially of the third upper molar. Howell  (1924:1012) considered such variation to be independent of age, but  Hinton (1926:103) related the changes to age and interpreted them as a  recapitulation of the evolution of microtine molars. In my series, an  indentation on the medial margin of the posterior loop of the third  upper molar seemed to be related to age. This indentation was absent in  the youngest vole (one and one-half months), absent or indefinite in  those voles less than 3-1/2 months of age, and progressively more marked  in the older voles.      Food Habits    The prairie vole, like other members of the genus _Microtus_, feeds  mostly on growing grass in spring and summer. Piles of cuttings in the  runways are characteristic sign of the presence of voles. The voles cut  successive sections from the bases of grasses until the young and tender  growing tips are within reach. The quantity of grass destroyed is  greater than that actually eaten, a fact which will have to be  considered in any attempt to evaluate the effects of voles upon a range.    In all piles of cut plants that were examined, _Bromus inermis_ was the  most common grass, and _Poa pratensis_ was the grass second in  abundance. These were, by far, the most common grasses present on the  areas studied; in most places, _B. inermis_ was dominant. Other grasses  present on the areas were occasionally found in the piles of cuttings.  Jameson (1947:133-136) found no utilization of _B. inermis_ by voles but  that grass was present in a relative abundance of only one per cent in  the areas studied by him. The voles that he studied ate alfalfa in large  amounts and alfalfa was, perhaps, the most common plant on the  particular areas where his voles were caught. Seemingly, the diet of  voles is determined mostly by the species composition of the habitat.    Other summer foods included pokeberries, blackberries and a few forbs  and insects. Forbs most commonly found in the piles of cuttings were the  leaves of the giant ragweed (younger plants only) and dandelion. Insect  remains were found in the stomachs of voles killed in summer and  occurred most frequently in those killed in August and September. At no  time did insects seem to be a major part of the diet but they were  present in most vole stomachs examined in late summer. Laboratory  experiments with summer foods gave inconclusive results but suggested  that the voles chose grasses on the basis of their growth stage rather  than according to their species. Young and tender grasses were chosen,  regardless of species, when various combinations of _Triodia flava_,  _Bromus inermis_ and _Poa pratensis_ were offered to the voles. At  times the voles showed a marked preference for dandelion greens, perhaps  because of their high moisture content; the voles' water needs were  satisfied mostly by eating such succulent vegetation.    Winter foods consisted of stored hay and fruits and of underground plant  parts. _Bromus inermis_ made up nearly all of the hay and was stored in  lengths of up to ten inches in underground chambers specially  constructed for storage. Underground parts of plants were reached by  tunnelling and were an especially important part of the voles' diet in  January and February. The fruit of _Solanum carolinense_ was eaten  throughout the winter and one underground chamber, opened in February,  1952, was packed full of these seemingly unsavory fruits. Fisher  (1945:436), in Missouri, found this fruit to be an important part of the  winter diet of voles. An occasional pod of the honey locust tree was  found partly eaten in a runway. Fitch (1953, _in litt._) often observed  girdling of honey locust and crab apple (_Pyrus ioensis_) root crowns on  the Reservation but I saw no evidence of bark eating, perhaps because my  study plots were mostly grassland. On two occasions when two voles were  in the same trap one of them was eaten. In both traps, all of the bait  had been eaten and the captured voles probably were approaching  starvation. Because the trapping procedure offered abundant opportunity  for cannibalism, the low frequency of its occurrence suggested that it  was not an important factor in satisfying food requirements under normal  conditions.      Runways and Nests    Perhaps the most characteristic sign of the presence of _Microtus  ochrogaster_ were their surface runways and underground tunnels. Only  rarely was a vole observed to expose itself to full view. When a trapped  vole was released it immediately dove out of sight into a runway. Once  in a runway, the vole showed no further evidence of alarm and was  usually in no hurry to get away. The runways seemed to provide a sense  of security and the voles were familiar with their range only through  runway travel. The urge to seek a runway immediately when exposed has  obvious survival value.    Surface runways were usually under a mat of debris. In areas where  debris was scanty or lacking, runways were usually absent. Jameson  (1947:136) reported that in alfalfa and clover fields the voles did not  make runways as they did in grassland, even in fields where trapping  records showed voles to be abundant. Typical surface runways are  approximately 50 mm. wide, only slightly cut into the ground and bare of  vegetation while in use. Usually they could be distinguished from the  runways of the pine vole, which were cut more deeply into the ground,  and those of the cotton rat which were wider and not so well cleared of  vegetation. Some runways ended in surface chambers and some of these  were lined with grass. Their size varied from a diameter of 90 mm. to  250 mm. and they seemed to be used primarily for resting places.    A runway system usually consisted of a long, crooked runway and several  branches. Two typical systems are illustrated in Fig. 16. The runway  systems often were not clearly limited; they merged with other systems  more or less completely. One map showed a runway system extending across  140 square meters and including 12 underground burrows. All of these  runways seemed to be part of a single runway system but the system  probably was used by more than one vole or family group of voles.  Sixteen of the 22 maps that were made extended across areas between 50  and 90 square meters. One map, mentioned above, was larger and the  remaining five smaller. The smallest extended across only 20 square  meters. Of course, the area encompassed by a set of runways changed  almost daily, as the voles extended some runways, added some and  abandoned others in the course of their daily travels.    [Illustration: FIG. 16. Maps of runway systems of the prairie vole. The  runways follow an irregular course and are frequently changed. The solid  lines represent surface runways and the dotted lines underground  passages.]    Each runway system contained underground nests. These were in chambers  from 70 mm. to 200 mm. below the surface and were up to 200 mm. in  diameter. Most systems that were mapped had from two to six of these  burrows.

On the  Sikkim side the snow-fall is always the heaviest; this range of  mountains stops most of the moist currents that drive up from the Bay of  Bengal, with the result that the rainfall in the Chumbi Valley on the  Tibetan side is only about a quarter of what it is at Gnatong on the  Sikkim side.    The descent into the Chumbi Valley was very steep and stony, as there  was a drop of over 5,000 feet from the top of the pass. The beauty of  the valley and its wild flowers made up, however, for the badness of the  path. The rhododendrons on the descent were extremely fine, and the  whole character of the vegetation was altered and became more European.  The great pink rhododendron _Aucklandi_ showed up splendidly in the dark  forests of silver fir (_A. Webbiana_) which here grows into a fine tree.  There was also the yellow rhododendron Campylocarpum and a white  rhododendron, probably Decorum; the beautiful _R. Cinnabarinum_ with its  orange bells of waxy flowers relieved the darkness of the firs. There  was a small Tibetan rest-house called Langra where our coolies wanted to  stop, but we pushed on past this and descended steeply through more  wonderful forests. As we got lower we found birch, sycamore, willow and  elder still clothed in the light green of early spring. A fine white  clematis, a pink and white spiraea, a yellow berberis, white roses and  the dark purple iris grew in profusion on either side of the path.  Underneath these were the small flowers of the wild strawberry, which  the Macdonald family collected later on in the year and made into jam in  great quantities.    Near the entrance to this side valley we came to Old Yatung with its  Chinese custom-house and wall built right across the valley to keep the  British from going any further. All this was now deserted and in ruins.  Soon afterwards we arrived in the main Chumbi Valley where were broad  fields filled with potatoes and ripening barley. The houses here were  mostly built of stone and wood and in two stories. In character they  much resembled Tirolese houses except for the elaborate carving over the  doors and windows and the many colours in which they were painted. We  passed through the prosperous villages of Richengong, Phema and Chumbi  before arriving at New Yatung, or Shassi as the Tibetans still prefer to  call it. Here was a comfortable bungalow overlooking the bazaar on the  other side of the river. Knowing that we had had a long and tiring march  and that our coolies would only arrive late that night, Mrs. Macdonald  had with much thoughtfulness sent over her servants who had tea and  dinner prepared for us on a generous scale. No attention could have been  more acceptable. It rained steadily all that night--a somewhat unusual  occurrence in this valley--but the next morning it cleared up and the  day was delightful.    The Chumbi Valley is one of the richest valleys in Tibet. Yatung lies at  a height of 9,400 feet. Apples and pears do well here, and barley, wheat  and potatoes are grown in great quantities. At this time of the year the  air is scented by the wild roses which grow in large bushes covered with  hundreds of cream-coloured and sweetly scented flowers. The villages  all look extremely prosperous and an air of peace and contentment seems  to pervade the valley. We had to hire a new lot of animals to take us on  to Phari--28 miles further up the Chumbi Valley. These all arrived in  good time, and by eight o'clock on May 27 our loads were all on their  way. Before leaving, I sent off a telegram to Sir Francis Younghusband  to announce the arrival of the Expedition in Tibet, a telegram which  arrived opportunely at the Anniversary Dinner of the Royal Geographical  Society, just at the commencement of dinner.    There is a small garrison at Yatung, consisting of twenty-five men of  the 73rd Carnatics. There was also a hospital and a supply depot from  which we were able to purchase sugar, flour, ata (coarse native flour)  and potatoes, while later on we were able to send back to it for further  supplies. We formed quite an imposing procession as we started off:  Wollaston and myself on our ponies, Gyalzen Kazi and Chheten Wangdi, our  interpreters, on their ponies which they had brought along with them.  There was Mr. Isaacs, the head clerk, with a red-coated chaprassi and a  syce also mounted, who accompanied us on a visit to two monasteries  further up the valley. The path followed close to the banks of the  Ammo-chu, which was now a clear stream and contained many a likely pool  for fish. The valley was full of delightful flowers; curious ground  orchids, with several beautiful varieties of the ladies' slipper grew  there; the wild roses, especially the large red one, were very  sweet-scented and filled the air with fragrance. Berberis, clematis and  some charming dwarf rhododendrons abounded. After going about 3 miles  the valley narrowed, and we passed the spot where the Chinese had built  another wall across the valley to keep us out. Just above this wall  there was a deserted Chinese village, for now all the Chinese have been  driven out of the country and are not allowed to go back and live there.  High above us on the hillside was the Punagang Monastery belonging to  the old sect of the Bhompo's, who turn their prayer wheels the opposite  to every one else and always keep to the right of Chortens and Mani  walls. This monastery was too far off the path for us to visit it. We  soon afterwards passed the large and flourishing village of Galinka  surrounded by fields of barley. Here we turned aside to visit the  Galinka Monastery, which stood in the midst of the village. This was  quite a new building, with a great gilt image of Buddha inside it. The  monks were still busy painting pictures of scenes from the life of  Buddha on the walls. They apparently did quite a good trade in selling  clay images of Buddha in his different forms and postures. These were  stamped by a very well cut brass die, which the monks told me had been  made at Shigatse. In a side room was a huge prayer wheel some 12 feet  high and 5 feet to 6 feet in diameter. It was covered over with painted  leather inscribed with the usual Om Mani Padme Hum (Hail, jewel of the  lotus flower). They told us the inside was also filled with prayers, and  that it contained one and a half million of these, so that each time the  wheel was turned a million and a half prayers were said for the person  who turned it. After each complete revolution it rings a bell. We were  allowed to turn it several times, so that I hope the many million  prayers sent up may benefit us. After leaving the monastery, the path  rose steeply and the river came down in a series of waterfalls. Above us  were masses of pink and mauve rhododendrons, flowering cherries,  viburnum, berberis, roses and other delightful shrubs. Soon afterwards,  at the entrance to the Lingmatang plain, we crossed the river and rode  up a rocky spur formed of great boulders that had some time or another  fallen down and blocked up the valley, forming a lake some 2 miles long,  but this lake no longer existed, and there was only a flat grassy plain  grazed over by yaks and ponies. On the top of the spur was the Donka  Monastery in a grand situation, commanding beautiful views up and down  the valley. I had hoped to see my friend the Geshe Lama or Geshe  Rimpoche, as he is sometimes known, with whom I had lunched last year at  the hot springs at Kambu, but unfortunately he was away at Lhasa. He is  a man of very great learning and held in high veneration throughout  these valleys.    On entering the big stone courtyard of the monastery a crowd of children  and Lamas at once flocked round us. We were shown over the main temple,  but it was badly lit with a few butter lamps and we could see little of  its contents; amongst these were several statues of Buddha under his  different forms. There were also kept there 108 volumes of the Tangyur,  one of the Buddhist sacred writings. These books were very curious. Each  volume consisted of a number of loose oblong parchment sheets 2 to 3  feet long and from 8 inches to a foot wide. These were kept together by  two elaborately carved boards between which they were pressed. The  writing was all done by hand by the Lamas, who copied out and  illuminated books with the greatest care and skill in the same manner  that the monks in the Middle Ages illuminated their missals. The  book-shelves of the library consisted of a number of pigeon-holes in the  walls in which these volumes were kept. Here, too, they were busy making  clay images to bury under the Chorten that they were building above the  monastery. Next door was another and newer temple, built to house the  Oracle, and called the Sanctuary of the Oracle. He, too, was  unfortunately away, as he was taking the hot waters at Kambu, but we  were shown his throne and the robes that he puts on when he prophesies.  There was a curiously shaped head-dress of silver, adorned all round  with silver skulls, and a very quaintly shaped bow and arrow which the  Oracle held in one hand while a huge trident was grasped in the other. I  am told that he is consulted far and wide and has a great reputation for  truth. We were then taken upstairs to a sunny verandah, just outside the  Geshe Rimpoche's private room and commanding fine views up and down the  valley. Here we were given Tibetan tea, made with salt and butter, and  served up in agate cups with beautifully chased silver covers. After  drinking this tea we were shown over the Geshe's private apartments and  chapel, the prevailing colour scheme of the room being yellow. The  little shrines with their silver bowls in front--the incense burner and  the flame that is never allowed to go out--were all very interesting to  us. We then took a photograph of the Lamas in front of their "]]]
