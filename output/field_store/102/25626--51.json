The only domestic animal they have is the dog, which in their language  is called Dingo, and a good deal resembles the fox dog of England. These  animals are equally shy of us, and attached to the natives. One of them  is now in the possession of the Governor, and tolerably well reconciled  to his new master. As the Indians see the dislike of the dogs to us,  they are sometimes mischievous enough to set them on single persons  whom they chance to meet in the woods. A surly fellow was one day out  shooting, when the natives attempted to divert themselves in this manner  at his expense. The man bore the teazing and gnawing of the dog at his  heels for some time, but apprehending at length, that his patience might  embolden them to use still farther liberties, he turned round and shot  poor Dingo dead on the spot: the owners of him set off with the utmost  expedition.    There is no part of the behaviour of these people, that has puzzled us  more, than that which relates to their women. Comparatively speaking we  have seen but few of them, and those have been sometimes kept back with  every symptom of jealous sensibility; and sometimes offered with every  appearance of courteous familiarity. Cautious, however, of alarming the  feelings of the men on so tender a point, we have constantly made a rule  of treating the females with that distance and reserve, which we judged  most likely to remove any impression they might have received of our  intending aught, which could give offence on so delicate a subject. And  so successful have our endeavours been, that a quarrel on this head  has in no instance, that I know of, happened. The tone of voice of the  women, which is pleasingly soft and feminine, forms a striking contrast  to the rough guttural pronunciation of the men. Of the other charms  of the ladies I shall be silent, though justice obliges me to mention,  that, in the opinion of some amongst us, they shew a degree of timidity  and bashfulness, which are, perhaps, inseparable from the female  character in its rudest state. It is not a little singular, that the  custom of cutting off the two lower joints of the little finger of the  left hand, observed in the Society Islands, is found here among the  women, who have for the most part undergone this amputation. Hitherto  we have not been able to trace out the cause of this usage. At first we  supposed it to be peculiar to the married women, or those who had borne  children; but this conclusion must have been erroneous, as we have no  right to believe that celibacy prevails in any instance, and some of the  oldest of the women are without this distinction; and girls of a very  tender age are marked by it.    On first setting foot in the country, we were inclined to hold the  spears of the natives very cheap. Fatal experience has, however,  convinced us, that the wound inflicted by this weapon is not a trivial  one; and that the skill of the Indians in throwing it, is far from  despicable. Besides more than a dozen convicts who have unaccountably  disappeared, we know that two, who were employed as rush cutters up  the harbour, were (from what cause we are yet ignorant) most dreadfully  mangled and butchered by the natives. A spear had passed entirely  through the thickest part of the body of one of them, though a very  robust man, and the skull of the other was beaten in. Their tools were  taken away, but some provisions which they had with them at the time of  the murder, and their cloaths, were left untouched. In addition to this  misfortune, two more convicts, who were peaceably engaged in picking of  greens, on a spot very remote from that where their comrades suffered,  were unawares attacked by a party of Indians, and before they could  effect their escape, one of them was pierced by a spear in the hip,  after which they knocked him down, and plundered his cloaths. The poor  wretch, though dreadfully wounded, made shift to crawl off, but his  companion was carried away by these barbarians, and his fate doubtful,  until a soldier, a few days afterwards, picked up his jacket and hat  in a native's hut, the latter pierced through by a spear. We have found  that these spears are not made invariably alike, some of them being  barbed like a fish gig, and others simply pointed. In repairing them  they are no less dexterous than in throwing them. A broken one  being given by a gentleman to an Indian, he instantly snatched up an  oyster-shell, and converted it with his teeth into a tool with which  he presently fashioned the spear, and rendered it fit for use: in  performing this operation, the sole of his foot served him as a  work-board. Nor are their weapons of offence confined to the spear only,  for they have besides long wooden swords, shaped like a sabre, capable  of inflicting a mortal wound, and clubs of an immense size. Small  targets, made of the bark of trees, are likewise now and then to be seen  among them.    From circumstances which have been observed, we have sometimes been  inclined to believe these people at war with each other. They have more  than once been seen assembled, as if bent on an expedition. An officer  one day met fourteen of them marching along in a regular Indian file  through the woods, each man armed with a spear in his right hand, and  a large stone in his left: at their head appeared a chief, who was  distinguished by being painted. Though in the proportion of five to one  of our people they passed peaceably on.    That their skill in throwing the spear sometimes enables them to kill  the kangaroo we have no right to doubt, as a long splinter of this  weapon was taken out of the thigh of one of these animals, over which  the flesh had completely closed; but we have never discovered that they  have any method of ensnaring them, or that they know any other beasts  but the kangaroo and dog. Whatever animal is shewn them, a dog excepted,  they call kangaroo: a strong presumption that the wild animals of the  country are very few.    Soon after our arrival at Port Jackson, I was walking out near a place  where I observed a party of Indians, busily employed in looking at some  sheep in an inclosure, and repeatedly crying out, 'kangaroo, kangaroo!'  As this seemed to afford them pleasure, I was willing to increase it by  pointing out the horses and cows, which were at no great distance. But  unluckily, at the moment, some female convicts, employed near the place,  made their appearance, and all my endeavours to divert their attention  from the ladies became fruitless. They attempted not, however, to offer  them the least degree of violence or injury, but stood at the distance  of several paces, expressing very significantly the manner they were  attracted.    It would be trespassing on the reader's indulgence were I to impose  on him an account of any civil regulations, or ordinances, which may  possibly exist among this people. I declare to him, that I know not of  any, and that excepting a little tributary respect which the younger  part appear to pay those more advanced in years, I never could observe  any degrees of subordination among them. To their religious rites and  opinions I am equally a stranger. Had an opportunity offered of seeing  the ceremonies observed at disposing of the dead, perhaps, some insight  might have been gained; but all that we at present know with certainty  is, that they burn the corpse, and afterwards heap up the earth around  it, somewhat in the manner of the small tumuli, found in many counties  of England.    I have already hinted, that the country is more populous than it was  generally believed to be in Europe at the time of our sailing. But  this remark is not meant to be extended to the interior parts of the  continent, which there is every reason to conclude from our researches,  as well as from the manner of living practised by the natives, to be  uninhabited. It appears as if some of the Indian families confine their  society and connections within their own pale: but that this cannot  always be the case we know; for on the north-west arm of Botany Bay  stands a village, which contains more than a dozen houses, and  perhaps five times that number of people; being the most considerable  establishment that we are acquainted with in the country. As a striking  proof, besides, of the numerousness of the natives, I beg leave to  state, that Governor Phillip, when on an excursion between the head of  this harbour and that of Botany Bay, once fell in with a party which  consisted of more than three hundred persons, two hundred and twelve of  whom were men: this happened only on the day following the murder of the  two convict rush cutters, before noticed, and his Excellency was at  the very time in search of the murderers, on whom, could they have been  found, he intended to inflict a memorable and exemplary punishment. The  meeting was unexpected to both parties, and considering the critical  situation of affairs, perhaps not very pleasing to our side, which  consisted but of twelve persons, until the peaceable disposition of  the Indians was manifest. After the strictest search the Governor was  obliged to return without having gained any information. The laudable  perseverance of his Excellency to throw every light on this unhappy and  mysterious business did not, however stop here, for he instituted the  most rigorous inquiry to find out, if possible, whether the convicts  had at any time ill treated or killed any of the natives; and farther,  issued a proclamation, offering the most tempting of all rewards, a  state of freedom, to him who should point out the murderer, in case such  an one existed.    I have thus impartially stated the situation of matters, as they stand,  while I write, between the natives and us; that greater progress in  attaching them to us has not been made, I have only to regret; but that  all ranks of men have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#9)"],[1,"the dismal \"Well, but what about us? of  his brother and sister by suggesting that they should mingle  unsuspected with the crowd. \"But don't let on that you know me,\"  he said; \"and try to look as if you belonged to some of the  grown-ups at the fair. If you don't, as likely as not you'll have the  kind policemen taking the little lost children by the hand and  leading them home to their stricken relations French governess, I  mean.\"    \"Let's go now,\" said the voice that they never could get quite used  to hearing, coming out of different parts of the air as Mabel moved  from one place to another. So they went.    The fair was held on a waste bit of land, about half a mile from the  castle gates. When they got near enough to hear the steam-organ of  the merry-go-round, Gerald suggested that as he had ninepence he  should go ahead and get something to eat, the amount spent to be  paid back out of any money they might make by conjuring. The  others waited in the shadows of a deep-banked lane, and he came  back, quite soon, though long after they had begun to say what a  long time he had been gone. He brought some Barcelona nuts,  red-streaked apples, small sweet yellow pears, pale pasty  gingerbread, a whole quarter of a pound of peppermint bulls-eyes,  and two bottles of ginger-beer.    \"It's what they call an investment,\" he said, when Kathleen said  something about extravagance. \"We shall all need special  nourishing to keep our strength up, especially the bold conjurer.\"    They ate and drank. It was a very beautiful meal, and the far-off  music of the steam-organ added the last touch of festivity to the  scene. The boys were never tired of seeing Mabel eat, or rather of  seeing the strange, magic-looking vanishment of food which was  all that showed of Mabel's eating. They were entranced by the  spectacle, and pressed on her more than her just share of the feast,  just for the pleasure of seeing it disappear.    \"My aunt!\" said Gerald, again and again; \"that ought to knock  'em!\"    It did.    Jimmy and Kathleen had the start of the others, and when they got  to the fair they mingled with the crowd, and were as unsuspected  as possible.    They stood near a large lady who was watching the Coconut shies,  and presently saw a strange figure with its hands in its pockets  strolling across the trampled yellowy grass among the bits of  drifting paper and the sticks and straws that always litter the  ground of an English fair. It was Gerald, but at first they hardly  knew him. He had taken off his tie, and round his head, arranged  like a turban, was the crimson school-scarf that had supported his  white flannels. The tie, one supposed, had taken on the duties of  the handkerchief. And his face and hands were a bright black, like  very nicely polished stoves!    Everyone turned to look at him.    \"He's just like a conjurer!\" whispered Jimmy. \"I don't suppose it'll  ever come off, do you?\"    They followed him at a distance, and when he went close to the  door of a small tent, against whose door-post a long-faced  melancholy woman was lounging, they stopped and tried to look as  though they belonged to a farmer who strove to send up a number  by banging with a big mallet on a wooden block.    Gerald went up to the woman.    \"Taken much?\" he asked, and was told, but not harshly, to go away  with his impudence.    \"I'm in business myself,\" said Gerald, \"I'm a conjurer, from India.\"    \"Not you!\" said the woman; \"you ain't no conjurer. Why, the backs  of yer ears is all white.\"    \"Are they?\" said Gerald. \"How clever of you to see that!\" He  rubbed them with his hands. \"That better?\"    \"That's all right. What's your little game?\"    \"Conjuring, really and truly,\" said Gerald. \"There's smaller boys  than me put on to it in India. Look here, I owe you one for telling  me about my ears. If you like to run the show for me I'll go shares.  Let me have your tent to perform in, and you do the patter at the  door.    \"Lor love you! I can't do no patter. And you're getting at me. Let's  see you do a bit of conjuring, since you're so clever an all.\"    \"Right you are,\" said Gerald firmly. \"You see this apple? Well, I'll  make it move slowly through the air, and then when I say \"Go!\"  it'll vanish.\"    \"Yes into your mouth! Get away with your nonsense.\"    \"You're too clever to be so unbelieving,\" said Gerald. \"Look here!\"    He held out one of the little apples, and the woman saw it move  slowly and unsupported along the air.    \"Now go!\" cried Gerald, to the apple, and it went. \"How's that?\" he  asked, in tones of triumph.    The woman was glowing with excitement, and her eyes shone.  \"The best I ever see!\" she whispered. \"I'm on, mate, if you know  any more tricks like that.\"    \"Heaps,\" said Gerald confidently; \"hold out your hand.\" The  woman held it out; and from nowhere, as it seemed, the apple  appeared and was laid on her hand. The apple was rather damp.    She looked at it a moment, and then whispered:    \"Come on! there's to be no one in it but just us two. But not in the  tent. You take a pitch here, 'longside the tent. It's worth twice the  money in the open air.\"    \"But people won't pay if they can see it all for nothing.\"    \"Not for the first turn, but they will after  you see. And you'll have  to do the patter.\"    \"Will you lend me your shawl?\" Gerald asked. She unpinned it it  was a red and black plaid and he spread it on the ground as he had  seen Indian conjurers do, and seated himself cross-legged behind  it.    \"I mustn't have anyone behind me, that's all,\" he said; and the  woman hastily screened off a little enclosure for him by hanging  old sacks to two of the guy-ropes of the tent. \"Now I'm ready, he  said. The woman got a drum from the inside of the tent and beat it.  Quite soon a little crowd had collected.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Gerald, \"I come from India, and I can  do a conjuring entertainment the like of which you've never seen.  When I see two shillings on the shawl I'll begin.\"    \"I dare say you will!\" said a bystander; and there were several  short, disagreeable laughs.    \"Of course,\" said Gerald, \"if you can't afford two shillings between  you\" there were about thirty people in the crowd by now \"I say no  more.\"    Two or three pennies fell on the shawl, then a few more then the  fall of copper ceased.    \"Ninepence,\" said Gerald. \"Well, I've got a generous nature. You'll  get such a ninepennyworth as you've never had before. I don't wish  to deceive you I have an accomplice, but my accomplice is  invisible.\"    The crowd snorted.    \"By the aid of that accomplice,\" Gerald went on, \"I will read any  letter that any of you may have in your pocket. If one of you will  just step over the rope and stand beside me, my invisible  accomplice will read that letter over his shoulder.\"    A man stepped forward, a ruddy-faced, horsy-looking person. He  pulled a letter from his pocket and stood plain in the sight of all, in  a place where everyone saw that no one could see over his  shoulder.    \"Now!\" said Gerald. There was a moment's pause. Then from quite  the other side of the enclosure came a faint, faraway, sing-song  voice. It said:    \"SIR Yours of the fifteenth duly to hand. With regard to the  mortgage on your land, we regret our inability \"    \"Stow it!\" cried the man, turning threateningly on Gerald.    He stepped out of the enclosure explaining that there was nothing  of that sort in his letter; but nobody believed him, and a buzz of  interested chatter began in the crowd, ceasing abruptly when  Gerald began to speak.    \"Now,\" said he, laying the nine pennies down on the shawl, \"you  keep your eyes on those pennies, and one by one you'll see them  disappear.\"    And of course they did. Then one by one they were laid down  again by the invisible hand of Mabel. The crowd clapped loudly.  \"Bravo!\" \"That's something like!\" \"Show us another!\" cried the  people in the front rank. And those behind pushed forward.    \"Now,\" said Gerald, \"you've seen what I can do, but I don't do any  more till I see five shillings on this carpet.\"    And in two minutes seven-and-threepence lay there and Gerald did  a little more conjuring.    When the people in front didn't want to give any more money,  Gerald asked them to stand back and let the others have a look in. I  wish I had time to tell you of all the tricks he did the grass round  his enclosure was absolutely trampled off by the feet of the people  who thronged to look at him. There is really hardly any limit to the  wonders you can do if you have an invisible accomplice. All sorts  of things were made to move about, apparently by themselves, and  even to vanish into the folds of Mabel's clothing. The woman stood  by, looking more and more pleasant as she saw the money come  tumbling in, and beating her shabby drum every time Gerald  stopped conjuring.    The news of the conjurer had spread all over the fair. The crowd  was frantic with admiration. The man who ran the coconut shies  begged Gerald to throw in his lot with him; the owner of the rifle  gallery offered him free board and lodging and go shares; and a  brisk, broad lady, in stiff black silk and a violet bonnet, tried to  engage him for the forthcoming Bazaar for Reformed Bandsmen.    And all this time the others mingled with the crowd  quite  unobserved, for who could have eyes for anyone but Gerald? It was  getting quite late, long past tea-time, and Gerald, who was getting  very tired indeed, and was quite satisfied with his share of the  money, was racking his brains for a way to get out of it.    \"How are we to hook it?\" he murmured, as Mabel made his cap  disappear from his head by the simple process of taking it off and  putting it in her pocket.    \"They'll never let us get away. I didn't think of that before.\"    \"Let me think!\" whispered Mabel; and next moment she said, close  to his ear: \"Divide the money, and give her something for the  shawl. Put the money"]]]
