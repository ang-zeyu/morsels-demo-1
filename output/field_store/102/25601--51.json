[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#9)"],[1,"some of the  provinces of Canada, have made laws prohibiting the trapping or  killing of beavers, to prevent them from being exterminated.    The beaver is an amphibious animal, resembling the muskrat in  appearance but much larger. It has the same thick, heavy body, short  neck and scaly tail. The hind feet are large and strong and the toes  are connected by a web; the front feet are small. The tail is \"paddle  shaped,\" four or five inches wide and about ten inches long. When  full grown, the beaver will weigh from forty to fifty pounds,  although occasionally a much larger one is found. The under fur is  very fine and soft, and is mixed with longer and coarser hairs called  \"guard hairs\". The prevailing color is a rich, reddish brown, on the  back and sides, and ashy beneath.    The food of the beaver consists mostly of bark, of such woods as  poplar, birch, willow and cottonwood, as well as the roots of the  water lily. In the south they also eat corn.    Beavers build houses of sticks, stones, and mud, similar in shape to  the houses of the muskrat, locating usually, in the edge, of a pond  or lake, but often making a large pond to suit their requirements, by  building a dam across the stream. Even when their houses are built on  a lake or pond, they always build a dam across the outlet, so as to  raise the water two or three feet.    The dams are built of the same material as the houses. Sometimes  there are one or two small dams found below the main dam, and they  are so well made that they will last for many years, and are so tight  that the water usually drips evenly over the top.    The houses are also very well made, the walls being several feet in  thickness. There are usually two entrances, both under water. The  size and general shape of the house depends on the number of beavers  inhabiting it. The house of a full family of beavers will usually  measure about twelve feet in diameter at the water line, but will  some times be even larger, and the height is about six or seven feet.  When there are only two or three beavers, the house is much smaller,  and more pointed on the top.    A full family consists of from six to eight members. There are  usually two old beavers, two or three two year olds, and two or three  young. The reason for this is that the young beavers remain two years  with the parents, and as it requires several years for them to grow  their full size, there are always three sizes in a family. When they  have reached the age of two years, they start out and make a house of  their own, the beavers born the spring before, becoming the medium  size, and a new litter taking their place. By autumn, the beavers  that have left the main family have their house and dam completed and  a store of food laid up for winter.    Many of the beavers travel about through the summer, following the  streams, and return to their homes early in the fall. Sometimes, if  they are late in getting back they will have to work day and night,  in order to get sufficient food gathered for winter, before the ice  comes. This food consists of saplings and small trees, which they  gnaw off about a foot above the ground, drag into the edge of the  water, where they are cut up into pieces of different lengths, stored  away, under water in front of the house. Just how they cause this  wood to sink, remain in place under the water, is a mystery. The  beaver spends the entire winter under the ice. When he feels hungry  he goes out and gets a piece of wood, takes it into the house, eats  the bark, and takes the peeled stick out again. They repair the house  and dam each fall and they also make holes in the bank under water,  to which they can retreat in case the house is disturbed, or when  they hear a noise on the ice.    Trappers who are well acquainted with the habits of the beaver, can  make a fair estimate of the number of inmates of a house. It  sometimes happens that a pair of young beavers, or a lone beaver that  has escaped from some family which has been trapped, will locate in  an old deserted house, and then it is not such an easy matter. The  experienced trapper, however, is not likely to be fooled. He goes  along the shore and carefully examines the stumps, where the animals  have been cutting trees for food. The amount of stuff that has been  cut will show, usually; but he has still a better way of determining  whether the work was done by one or more beavers. He examines the  teeth marks on the stumps, and if they are all alike, he decides that  there is not a full family, but only two, or perhaps only one.    A lone beaver that has escaped from the trapper, is difficult to  trap. I remember once finding such a one, located on a large pool of  a fair sized stream. He had no dam and had only a small house along  the bank. I found him in the fall, while the water was still open,  and he was busy laying in a supply of food for winter. Well, I went  there one rainy day and set two traps. I set the traps very  carefully, fastening to sliding poles, which I had cut quite a  distance away so as not to make any noise near the house. The rain  washed the scent away in a short time, and I could see no reason why  he should take alarm; but he did, just the same. I kept those traps  set a week, but did not catch him, nor did I ever see any fresh signs  there, after I had set the traps. Apparently he had left the place  immediately after I had set the traps. An Indian trapper had trapped  several families of beavers, near there the season before, and this  beaver was one that had \"given him the slip.\"    In cutting timber, the beaver takes the wood in small chips, gnawing  all around the tree, until it falls. He knows absolutely nothing  about throwing the tree in the direction in which he wishes it to  fall, but lets it fall just as it is inclined to go. I have seen  where a tree had lodged, refusing to fall, and the beaver had stood  up and cut several pieces off the butt, and as the tree still refused  to fall, he had let it remain hanging. It was a case of hard work and  no pay.    When one finds a family of beavers, and expects to trap the same  ground each season, he should not attempt to catch them all, as by  leaving a few to breed, he is sure of getting beavers each season.  The Indians, in such cases, trap the old beavers only, which they do  by setting the traps a good distance from the house, for the young  beavers never venture far away.    Many beavers are trapped in the fall just before the ice forms, but  their fur is not prime until mid-winter. In the north they remain in  good condition until the first of June; in the south they would  probably not be good after the middle of April.    Beaver castors have a market value, usually selling for seven or  eight dollars a pound. In preparing them, they should be dried  slowly, in a shady place. Most trappers prefer to keep the castors  for scent, as it is attractive to many animals. The Indians sometimes  combine the two scents by making a hole in the beaver castors, and  squeezing the contents of the oil castors into them. The castors are  then hung up and allowed to dry. This is more or less attractive to  all animals, only a small piece being used in connection with the  bait.    The best traps for beavers are the Nos. 2 1/2, 3, 3 1/2 and 4  Newhouse, the No. 4 Victor, the No. 4 Oneida Jump, and Blake & Lamb.      [Illustration: Trap Set for Beaver--Sliding Pole.]    The following methods of trapping are for use in open water, in  either the fall or spring. The first method given is usually  considered best:    Find a place where the bank bluffs a little and the water is of good  depth. Make a little pocket in the bank, several inches deep, and set  the trap in the water directly in front of this pocket, where the pan  of the trap will be about two inches under water. Take a piece of  beaver castor and fasten it to the bank with a stick, about fourteen  inches above the water, and as far back in the pocket as possible. If  you are using some other scent instead of beaver castor, just dip a  small stick in the scent and fasten it to the bank. Fasten the trap  so that the beaver will drown; the sliding pole is best. Be sure to  use a dead pole or stake, as if a green pole is used the other  beavers may carry it away, trap and all. This is a very good method  for spring and fall, or at any time when there is open water:    Here is another method for the same kind of place:    Set the trap under water at the foot of a steep bank, and fasten a  couple of green poplar or cottonwood sticks on the bank, directly  over the trap, so that the beaver will step into the trap in trying  to reach them. Have the fresh cut ends of the sticks showing plainly,  and make your set near the house or dam so that the beavers are sure  to see it. Fasten trap so that the captured animal will be sure to  drown. No covering is needed on traps when they are set under water.    Look for the beaver's slides or trails where he drags his food into  the water, and if the water is deep enough to drown him, set the trap  under about two inches of water, just where he lands on the bank.  This set is all right in the fall, when the beaver is laying in his  food for the winter, but is not much good in the spring. Some  trappers set the trap a foot or more from the shore, where the water  is about six inches deep, as by so doing the beaver is caught by the  hind foot, and is not so likely to escape. When using a set of this  kind, it is best to use a number 3 1/2 or 4 trap, as the No. 3 is too  small for the beaver's hind foot.    Beavers usually have a slide or trail over the center of the dam, and  this makes a very good place to set a trap. Set the trap under water  on the upper side of the dam, just where the trail leads over. Be  sure to fasten the trap so that the animal will drown, as if it is  not drowned, it is almost certain to escape, and even if it does not,  the others"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#9)"],[1," to shoot some more buffalo for me.\"    \"Who is this, who speaks so insultingly to you, father?\" asked the son.    \"It is a bear who lives near here, and makes me kill buffalo for his  family, and he won't let me take even one little drop of blood from the  killing, and consequently, my son, I have nothing in my house for you to  eat.\"    The young man was anxious to meet Mr. Bear but Rabbit advised him to  wait a little until he and Bear had gone to the hunt. So the son obeyed,  and when he thought it time that the killing was done, he started out  and arrived on the scene just as Mr. Bear was about to proceed with his  butchering.    Seeing a strange shadow on the ground beside him, Mr. Bear looked up and  gazed into the fearless eyes of rabbit's handsome son.    \"Who is this?\" asked Mr. Bear of poor little Rabbit.    \"I don't know,\" answered Rabbit.    \"Who are you?\" asked the bear of Rabbit's son. \"Where did you come  from?\"    The rabbit's son not replying, the bear spoke thus to him: \"Get out of  here, and get out quick, too.\"    At this speech the rabbit's son became angered, and fastened an arrow to  his bow and drove the arrow through the bear's heart. Then he turned on  Mrs. Bear and served her likewise. During the melee, Rabbit shouted:  \"My son, my son, don't kill the two youngest. The baby has kept me from  starving and the other one is good and kind to his baby brother.\"    So the three older brothers who were unkind to their baby brother met a  similar fate to that of their selfish parents.    This (the story goes) is the reason that bears travel only in pairs.              THE BRAVE WHO WENT ON THE WARPATH ALONE AND WON THE NAME OF THE LONE  WARRIOR    There was once a young man whose parents were not overburdened with the  riches of this world, and consequently could not dress their only son in  as rich a costume as the other young men of the tribe, and on account of  not being so richly clad as they, he was looked down upon and shunned by  them. He was never invited to take part in any of their sports; nor was  he ever asked to join any of the war parties.    In the village lived an old man with an only daughter. Like the other  family, they were poor, but the daughter was the belle of the tribe. She  was the most sought after by the young men of the village, and warriors  from tribes far distant came to press their suit at winning her for  their bride. All to no purpose; she had the same answer for them as she  had for the young men of the village.    The poor young man was also very handsome despite his poor clothes, but  having never killed an enemy nor brought home any enemies' horses he was  not (according to Indian rules) allowed to make love to any young or old  woman. He tried in vain to join some of the war parties, that he might  get the chance to win his spurs as a warrior. To all his pleadings,  came the same answer: \"You are not fit to join a war party. You have no  horses, and if you should get killed our tribe would be laughed at and  be made fun of as you have such poor clothes, and we don't want the  enemy to know that we have any one of our tribe who dresses so poorly as  you do.\"    Again, and again, he tried different parties, only to be made fun of and  insulted.    One night he sat in the poor tepee of his parents. He was in deep study  and had nothing to say. His father, noticing his melancholy mood, asked  him what had happened to cause him to be so quiet, as he was always of a  jolly disposition. The son answered and said:    \"Father, I am going on the warpath alone. In vain I have tried to be  a member of one of the war parties. To all of my pleadings I have got  nothing but insults in return.\"    \"But my son, you have no gun nor ammunition. Where can you get any and  how can you get it? We have nothing to buy one for you with,\" said the  father.    \"I don't need any weapons. I am going to bring back some of the enemies'  horses, and I don't need a gun for that.\"    Early the next morning (regardless of the old couple's pleadings not  to go unarmed) the young man left the village and headed northwest, the  direction always taken by the war parties.    For ten days he traveled without seeing any signs of a camp. The evening  of the tenth day, he reached a very high butte, thickly wooded at the  summit. He ascended this butte, and as he sat there between two large  boulders, watching the beautiful rays of the setting sun, he was  suddenly startled to hear the neigh of a horse. Looking down into the  beautiful valley which was threaded by a beautiful creek fringed with  timber, he noticed close to the base of the butte upon which he sat, a  large drove of horses grazing peacefully and quietly. Looking closer, he  noticed at a little distance from the main drove, a horse with a saddle  on his back. This was the one that had neighed, as the drove drifted  further away from him. He was tied by a long lariat to a large sage  bush.    Where could the rider be, he said to himself. As if in answer to his  question, there appeared not more than twenty paces from him a middle  aged man coming up through a deep ravine. The man was evidently in  search of some kind of game, as he held his gun in readiness for instant  use, and kept his eyes directed at every crevice and clump of bush.  So intent was he on locating the game he was trailing, that he never  noticed the young man who sat like a statue not twenty paces away.  Slowly and cautiously the man approached, and when he had advanced to  within a few paces of the young man he stopped and turning around, stood  looking down into the valley. This was the only chance that our brave  young friend had. Being unarmed, he would stand no show if the enemy  ever got a glimpse of him. Slowly and noiselessly he drew his hunting  knife (which his father had given him on his departure from home) and  holding it securely in his right hand, gathered himself and gave a leap  which landed him upon the unsuspecting enemy's shoulders. The force with  which he landed on the enemy caused him (the enemy) to lose his hold on  his gun, and it went rattling down into the chasm, forty feet below.    Down they came together, the young man on top. No sooner had they struck  the ground than the enemy had out his knife, and then commenced a hand  to hand duel. The enemy, having more experience, was getting the best of  our young friend. Already our young friend had two ugly cuts, one across  his chest and the other through his forearm.    He was becoming weak from the loss of blood, and could not stand the  killing pace much longer. Summoning all his strength for one more trial  to overcome his antagonist, he rushed him toward the chasm, and in his  hurry to get away from this fierce attack, the enemy stepped back one  step too far, and down they both went into the chasm. Interlocked in  each other's arms, the young man drove his knife into the enemy's  side and when they struck the bottom the enemy relaxed his hold and  straightened out stiff and dead.    Securing his scalp and gun, the young man proceeded down to where the  horse was tied to the sage bush, and then gathering the drove of horses  proceeded on his return to his own village. Being wounded severely he  had to ride very slowly. All the long hours of the night he drove the  horses towards his home village.    In the meantime, those at the enemies' camp wondered at the long absence  of the herder who was watching their drove of horses, and finally seven  young men went to search for the missing herder. All night long they  searched the hillsides for the horses and herder, and when it had grown  light enough in the morning they saw by the ground where there had been  a fierce struggle.    Following the tracks in the sand and leaves, they came to the chasm  where the combatants had fallen over, and there, lying on his back  staring up at them in death, was their herder. They hastened to the camp  and told what they had found. Immediately the warriors mounted their war  ponies (these ponies are never turned loose, but kept tied close to the  tepee of the owner), and striking the trail of the herd driven off by  our young friend, they urged forth their ponies and were soon far from  their camp on the trail of our young friend. All day long they traveled  on his trail, and just as the sun was sinking they caught sight of him  driving the drove ahead over a high hill. Again they urged forth their  tired ponies. The young man, looking back along the trail, saw some dark  objects coming along, and, catching a fresh horse, drove the rest ahead  at a great rate. Again all night he drove them, and when daylight came  he looked back (from a high butte) over his trail and saw coming over a  distant raise, two horsemen. These two undoubtedly rode the best ponies,  as he saw nothing of the others. Driving the horses into a thick belt  of timber, he concealed himself close to the trail made by the drove of  horses, and lay in ambush for the two daring horsemen who had followed  him so far. Finally they appeared on the butte from where he had looked  back and saw them following him. For a long time they sat there scouring  the country before them in hopes that they might see some signs of their  stolen horses. Nothing could they see. Had they but known, their horses  were but a few hundred yards from them, but the thick timber securely  hid them from view. Finally one of them arose and pointed to the timber.  Then leaving his horse in charge of his friend, he descended the butte  and followed the trail of the drove to where they had entered the  timber. Little did he think that he was standing on the brink of  eternity. The young man hiding not more than a hundred yards from him  could have shot him there where he stood, but wanting to play fair, he  stepped into sight. When he did, the enemy took quick aim and fired. He  was too hasty. Had he taken more careful aim he might have killed our  young friend, but"]]]
