In dry soil, chiefly in the woods, this violet may be found from  Southern Canada westward to Minnesota, and south to northern  boundaries of the Gulf States. Only its side petals are bearded  to form footrests for the insects that search for the deeply  secreted nectar. Many butterflies visit this flower. On entering  it a bee must first touch the stigma before any fresh golden  pollen is released from the anther cone, and cross-fertilization  naturally results.    In shale and sandy soil, even in the gravel of hillsides, one  finds the narrowly divided, finely cut leaves and the bicolored  beardless blossom of the BIRD'S-FOOT VIOLET (V. pedata), pale  bluish purple on the lower petals, dark purple on one or two  upper ones, and with a heart of gold. The large, velvety,  pansy-like blossom and the unusual foliage which rises in rather  dense tufts are sufficient to distinguish the plant from its  numerous kin. This species produces no cleistogamous or blind  flowers. Frequently the bird's-foot violet blooms a second time,  in autumn, a delightful eccentricity of this family. The spur of  its lower petal is long and very slender, and, as might be  expected, the longest-tongued bees and butterflies are its most  frequent visitors. These receive the pollen on the base of the  proboscis.    The WOOLLY BLUE VIOLET (V. sororia), whose stems and younger  leaves, at least, are covered with hairs, and whose purplish-blue  flowers are more or less bearded within, prefers a shady but dry  situation; whereas its next of kin, the ARROW-LEAVED VIOLET (V.  sagittata), delights in moist but open meadows and marshes. The  latter's long, arrow, or halberd-shaped leaves, usually entire  above the middle, but slightly lobed below it, may rear  themselves nine inches high in favorable soil, or in dry uplands  perhaps only two inches. The flowering scapes grow as tall as the  leaves. All but the lower petal of the large, deep, dark,  purplish-blue flower are bearded. This species produces an  abundance of late cleistogamous flowers on erect stems. These  peculiar greenish flowers without petals, that are so often  mistaken for buds or seed vessels; that never open, but without  insect aid ripen quantities of fertile seed, are usually borne,  if not actually under ground, then not far above it, on nearly  all violet plants. It will be observed that all species which  bear blind flowers rely somewhat on showy, cross-fertilized  blossoms also to counteract degeneracy from close inbreeding.    The OVATE-LEAVED VIOLET (V. ovata), formerly reckoned as a mere  variety of the former species, is now accorded a distinct rank.  Not all the blossoms, but an occasional clump, has a faint  perfume like sweet clover. The leaf is elongated, but rather too  round to be halberd-shaped; the stems are hairy; and the flowers,  which closely resemble those of the arrow-leaved violet, are  earlier; making these two species, which are popularly mistaken  for one, among the earliest and commonest of their clan. The dry  soil of upland woods and thickets is the ovate-leaved violet's  preferred habitat.    In course of time the lovely ENGLISH, MARCH, or SWEET VIOLET, (V.  odorata), which has escaped from gardens, and which is now  rapidly increasing with the help of seed and runners on the  Atlantic and the Pacific coasts, may be established among our  wild flowers. No blossom figures so prominently in European  literature. In France, it has even entered the political field  since Napoleon's day. Yale University has adopted the violet for  its own especial flower, although it is the corn-flower, or  bachelor's button (Centaurea cyanus) that is the true Yale blue.  Sprengel, who made a most elaborate study of the violet,  condensed the result of his research into the following questions  and answers, which are given here because much that he says  applies to our own native species, which have been too little  studied in the modern scientific spirit:    \"1. Why is the flower situated on a long stalk which is upright,  but curved downwards at the free end? In order that it may hang  down; which, firstly, prevents rain from obtaining access to the  nectar; and, secondly, places the stamens in such a position that  the pollen falls into the open space between the pistil and the  free ends of the stamens. If the flower were upright, the pollen  would fall into the space between the base of the stamen and the  base of the pistil, and would not come in contact with the bee.    \"2. Why does the pollen differ from that of most other  insect-fertilized flowers? In most of such flowers the insects  themselves remove the pollen from the anthers, and it is  therefore important that the pollen should not easily be detached  and carried away by the wind. In the present case, on the  contrary, it is desirable that it should be looser and dryer, so  that it may easily fall into the space between the stamens and  the pistil. If it remained attached to the anther, it would not  be touched by the bee, and the flower would remain unfertilized.    \"3. Why is the base of the style so thin? In order that the bee  may be more easily able to bend the style.    \"4. Why is the base of the style bent? For the same reason. The  result of the curvature is that the pistil is much more easily  bent than would be the case if the style were straight.    \"5. Finally, why does the membranous termination of the upper  filament overlap the corresponding portions of the two middle  stamens? Because this enables the bee to move the pistil, and  thereby to set free the pollen more easily than would be the case  under the reverse arrangement.\"    In high altitudes of New England, Colorado. and northward, where  the soil is wet and cold, the pale lilac, slightly bearded  petals, streaked with darker veins, of the MARSH VIOLET (V.  palustris), with its almost round leaves, may be found from May  to June. All through the White Mountains one finds it abundant.    A peculiarity of the DOG or RUNNING VIOLET (V. Labradorica) is  that its small, heart-shaped leaves are set along the branching  stem, and its pale purple blossoms rise from their angles, pansy  fashion. From March to May it blooms throughout its wide range in  wet, shady places. Its English prototype, called by the same  invidious name, was given the prefix \"dog,\" because the word,  which is always intended to express contempt in the British mind,  is applied in this case for the flower's lack of fragrance. When  a bee visits this violet, his head coming in contact with the  stigma jars it, thus opening the little pollen box, whose  contents must fall out on his head and be carried away and rubbed  off where it will fertilize the next violet visited.      SEA LAVENDER; MARSH ROSEMARY; CANKER-ROOT; INK-ROOT    (Limonium Carolinianum; Statice Limonium of Gray)  Plumbago  family    Flowers - Very tiny, pale, dull lavender, erect, set along upper  side of branches. Calyx 5-toothed, tubular, plaited; corolla of 5  petals opposite as many stamens; 1 pistil with 5 thread-like  styles. Scape: 1 to 2 ft. high, slender, leafless, much branched  above. Leaves: All from thick, fleshy rootstock, narrowly oblong,  tapering into margined petioles, thick, the edges slightly waved,  not toothed; midrib prominent.  Preferred Habitat - Salt meadows and marshes.  Flowering Season - July-October.  Distribution  -  Atlantic coast from Labrador to Florida,  westward along the Gulf to Texas; also in Europe.    Seen in masses, from a little distance, this tiny flower looks  like blue-gray mist blown in over the meadows from the sea, and  on closer view each plant suggests sea-spray itself. Thrifty  housewives along the coast dry it for winter bouquets, partly for  ornament and partly because there is an old wives' tradition that  it keeps away moths. Statice, from the Greek verb to stop, hence  an astringent, was the generic name formerly applied to the  plants, with whose roots these same old women believed they cured  canker sores.      FRINGED GENTIAN    (Gentiana crinita)  Gentian family    Flowers - Deep, bright blue, rarely white, several or many, about  2 in. high, stiffly erect, and solitary at ends of very long  foot-stalk. Calyx of 4 unequal, acutely pointed lobes. Corolla  funnel form, its four lobes spreading, rounded, fringed around  ends, but scarcely on sides. Four stamens inserted on corolla  tube; 1 pistil with 2 stigmas. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, usually  branched, leafy. Leaves: Opposite, upper ones acute at tip,  broadening to heart-shaped base, seated on stem. Fruit: A  spindle-shaped, 2-valved capsule, containing numerous scaly,  hairy seeds.  Preferred Habitat - Low, moist meadows and woods.  Flowering Season - September-November.  Distribution - Quebec, southward to Georgia, and westward beyond  the Mississippi.        \"Thou waitest late, and com'st alone       When woods are bare and birds have flown,       And frosts and shortening days portend       The aged year is near his end.        \"Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye       Look through its fringes to the sky,       Blue - blue - as if that sky let fail       A flower from its cerulean wall.\"    When we come upon a bed of gentians on some sparkling October  day, we can but repeat Bryant's thoughts and express them  prosaically who attempt description. In dark weather this  sunshine lover remains shut, to protect its nectar and pollen  from possible showers. An elusive plant is this gentian, which by  no means always reappears in the same places year after year, for  it is an annual whose seeds alone perpetuate it. Seating  themselves on the winds when autumn gales shake them from out of  the home wall, these little hairy scales ride afar, and those  that are so fortunate as to strike into soft, moist soil at the  end of the journey, germinate.

He was the first constructor and pilot of a dirigible balloon that  made a round trip, that is to say returned to its starting place  after rounding a stake at some distance--in this instance the Eiffel  Tower, 3-1/2 miles from St. Cloud whence Santos-Dumont started and  whither he returned within half an hour, the time prescribed.    This was not, indeed, the first occasion on which a round trip,  necessitating operation against the wind on at least one course, had  been made. In 1884 Captain Renard had accomplished this feat for the  first time with the fish-shaped balloon _La France_, driven by an  electric motor of nine horse-power. But though thus antedated in his  exploit, Santos-Dumont did in fact accomplish more for the  advancement and development of dirigible balloons. To begin with he  was able to use a new and efficient form of motor destined to become  popular, and capable, as the automobile manufacturers later showed,  of almost illimitable development in the direction of power and  lightness. Except for the gasoline engine, developed by the makers  of motor cars, aviation to-day would be where it was a quarter of a  century ago.    Moreover by his personal qualities, no less than by his successful  demonstration of the possibilities inherent in the dirigible,  Santos-Dumont persuaded the French Government to take up aeronautics  again, after abandoning the subject as the mere fad of a number of  visionaries.    Turning from balloons to airplanes the Brazilian was the first  aviator to make a flight with a heavier-than-air machine before a  body of judges. This triumph was mainly technical. The Wrights had  made an equally notable flight almost a year before but not under  conditions that made it a matter of scientific record.    But setting aside for the time the work done by Santos-Dumont with  machines heavier than air, let us consider his triumphs with  balloons at the opening of his career. He had come to France about  forty years after Henry Giffard had demonstrated the practicability  of navigating a balloon 144 feet long and 34 feet in diameter with a  three-horse-power steam-engine. But no material success attended  this demonstration, important as it was, and the inventor turned his  attention to captive balloons, operating one at the Paris Exposition  of 1878 that took up forty passengers at a time. There followed  Captain Renard to whose achievement we have already referred. He had  laid down as the fundamentals of a dirigible balloon these  specifications:         A cigar, or fishlike shape.         An internal sack or ballonet into which air might be pumped to       replace any lost gas, and maintain the shape of the balloon.         A keel, or other longitudinal brace, to maintain the longitudinal       stability of the balloon and from which the car containing the       motor might be hung.         A propeller driven by a motor, the size and power of both to be       as great as permitted by the lifting power of the balloon.         A rudder capable of controlling the course of the ship.    Santos-Dumont adopted all of these specifications, but added to them  certain improvements which gave his airships--he built five of them  before taking his first prize--notable superiority over that of  Renard. To begin with he had the inestimable advantage of having the  gasoline motor. He further lightened his craft by having the  envelope made of Japanese silk, in flat defiance of all the builders  of balloons who assured him that the substance was too light and its  use would be suicidal. \"All right,\" said the innovator to his  favourite constructor, who refused to build him a balloon of that  material, \"I'll build it myself.\" In the face of this threat the  builder capitulated. The balloon was built, and the silk proved to  be the best fabric available at that time for the purpose. A keel  made of strips of pine banded together with aluminum wire formed the  backbone of the Santos-Dumont craft, and from it depended the car  about one quarter of the length of the balloon and hung squarely  amidships. The idea of this keel occurred to the inventor while  pleasuring at Nice. Later it saved his life.    One novel and exceedingly simple device bore witness to the  ingenuity of the inventor. He had noticed in his days of free  ballooning that to rise the aeronaut had to throw out sand-ballast;  to descend he had to open the valves and let out gas. As his supply  of both gas and sand was limited it was clear that the time of his  flight was necessarily curtailed every time he ascended or  descended. Santos-Dumont thought to husband his supplies of lifting  force and of ballast, and make the motor raise and lower the ship.  It was obvious that the craft would go whichever way the bow might  be pointed, whether up or down. But how to shift the bow? The  solution seems so simple that one wonders it ever perplexed  aviators. From the peak of the bow and stern of his craft  Santos-Dumont hung long ropes caught in the centre by lighter ropes  by which they could be dragged into the car. In the car was carried  a heavy bag of sand, which so long as it was there held the ship in  a horizontal plane. Was it needful to depress the bow? Then the bow  rope was hauled in, the bag attached, and swung out to a position  where it would pull the forward tip of the delicately adjusted gas  bag toward the earth. If only a gentle inclination was desired the  bag was not allowed to hang directly under the bow, but was held at  a point somewhere between the car and the bow so that the pull would  be diagonal and the great cylinder would be diverted but little from  the horizontal. If it were desired to ascend, a like manipulation of  the ballast on the stern rope would depress the stern and point the  bow upwards. For slight changes in direction it was not necessary  even to attach the sand bag. Merely drawing the rope into the car  and thus changing the line of its \"pull\" was sufficient.    The Deutsch prize which stimulated Santos-Dumont to his greatest  achievements with dirigibles was a purse of twenty thousand dollars,  offered by Mr. Henry Deutsch, a wealthy patron of the art of  aviation. Not himself an aviator, M. Deutsch greatly aided the  progress of the air's conquest. Convinced that the true solution of  the problem lay in development of the gasoline engine, he expended  large sums in developing and perfecting it. When he believed it was  sufficiently developed to solve the problem of directing the flight  of balloons he offered his prize for the circuit of the Eiffel  Tower. The conditions of the contest were not easy. The competitor  had to sail from the Aero Club at St. Cloud, pass twice over the  Seine which at that point makes an abrupt bend, sail over the Bois  de Boulogne, circle the Tower, and return to the stopping place  within a half an hour. The distance was about seven miles, and it is  noteworthy that in his own comment on the test Santos-Dumont  complains that that required an average speed of fifteen miles an  hour of which he could not be sure with his balloon. To-day  dirigibles make sixty miles an hour, and airplanes not infrequently  reach 130 miles. Moreover there could be no picking of a day on  which atmospheric conditions were especially good. Mr. Deutsch had  stipulated that the test must be made in the presence of a  Scientific Commission whose members must be notified twenty-four  hours in advance. None could tell twenty-four hours ahead what the  air might be like, and as for utilizing the aviator's most  favourable hour, the calm of the dawn, M. Santos-Dumont remarked:  \"The duellist may call out his friends at that sacred hour, but not  the airship captain.\"    The craft with which the Brazilian first strove to win the Deutsch  prize he called _Santos-Dumont No. V._ It was a cylinder, sharp at  both ends, 109 feet long and driven by a 12-horse-power motor. A new  feature was the use of piano wire for the support of the car, thus  greatly reducing the resistance of the air which in the case of the  old cord suspensions was almost as great as that of the balloon  itself. Another novel feature was water ballast tanks forward and  aft on the balloon itself and holding together twelve gallons. By  pulling steel wires in the car the aviator could open the  stop-cocks. The layman scarcely appreciates the very slight shift in  ballast which will affect the stability of a dirigible. The shifting  of a rope a few feet from its normal position, the dropping of two  handfuls of sand, or release of a cup of water will do it. A  humorous writer describing a lunch with Santos-Dumont in the air  says: \"Nothing must be thrown overboard, be it a bottle, an empty  box or a chicken bone without the pilot's permission.\"    After unofficial tests of his \"No. 5\" in one of which he circled the  Tower without difficulty, Santos-Dumont summoned the Scientific  Commission for a test. In ten minutes he had turned the Tower, and  started back against a fierce head-wind, which made him ten minutes  late in reaching the time-keepers. Just as he did so his engine  failed, and after drifting for a time his ship perched in the top of  a chestnut tree on the estate of M. Edmond Rothschild. Philosophical  as ever the aeronaut clung to his craft, dispatched an excellent  lunch which the Princess Isabel, Comtesse d'Eu, daughter of Dom  Pedro, the deposed Emperor of Brazil, sent to his eyrie in the  branches, and finally extricated himself and his balloon--neither  much the worse for the accident. He had failed but his determination  to win was only whetted.    The second trial for the Deutsch prize like the first ended in  failure, but that failure was so much more dramatic even than the  success which attended the third effort that it is worth telling and  can best be told in M. Santos-Dumont's own words. The quotation is  from his memoir, _My Airships_:"]]]
