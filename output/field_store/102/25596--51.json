[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#9)"],[1,"a bee clean itself will have noticed that the  front legs work more or less horizontally--a bee will lower its head and  bring its front leg over it with a curved motion--and that it will clean  the sides of the face with a sort of shaving-like action, also that the  antennae are apparently pulled through the foot-joint in a remarkable way,  often many times in succession. Now the foot of a bee consists of five  joints, and is clothed with bristly looking hairs. If these hairs be  examined through a microscope they will be found to be more or less  razor-shaped, having a thick back and a dilated wing or knife-like blade  (fig. 10). In some the blade is of some width, and the edge is evidently  very sharp: these hairs or spines no doubt do the cleaning work, and  admirably adapted they are to the purpose. The antennae-cleaner {69}  [Illustration: FIG. 10.] [Illustration: FIG. 11.] [Illustration: FIG. 12.]  (it may possibly be used for other purposes too) is a still more wonderful  adaptation; in the basal joint of the foot there is a semicircular  incision, which, when examined under the microscope, is seen to be a small  toothed comb. The foot itself fits into the tibia or shin, and at the apex  of the latter is a modified spine which is dilated on one side into a wing,  or knife-like blade; this shuts down on to the semicircular comb, and the  insect by passing the antennae between the two can clean off anything which  may have stuck to it (fig. 11). When we come to examine the other legs we  find that the inner surface of their tibiae and tarsi, i.e. that which is  nearest the body, is clothed with hairs which have the points dilated and  spade-like (fig. 12), which {70} allowing for the different action of the  hind legs makes them just as good cleaners as the razors of the front pair;  the spurs at the apex of the tibiae, which are known as the _calcaria_, are  also doubtless useful for cleaning purposes, and this is specially  suggested by the beautiful saw-like form which they assume in some species;  although there is no actual semicircular comb in the first joint of the  tarsi, yet there can be little doubt that the spur and this joint in  conjunction can act as a cleaning organ very much in the same way as the  more elaborate arrangement in the front legs. Any one who has the  opportunity of examining the hairs of bees under a microscope will be amply  repaid for the trouble in noticing the beautiful shapes and structures  which these organs assume. (Figs. 13-18; 17 showing pollen grains  adhering.) At one time, when I was specially examining bee hairs, I shaved  the various parts of a large number of species and mounted their hairs dry  in microscopic slides, merely securing the cover glass with liquid glue;  this was twenty years ago, and many are still quite good. It may seem a  difficult operation to shave a bee, but {71} the hairs come off very  easily, and with a sharp dissecting knife for a razor as many hairs as one  wants are almost immediately at one's disposal.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.]    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]           *       *       *       *       *    {72}    ON BEES' TONGUES, AND HOW THEY SUCK HONEY    In order to understand how a bee sucks honey it will be necessary to go  into some rather careful details as to the construction of its tongue and  mouth organs. These I will make as short and simple as I can, but the  apparatus is a very complicated one, and it will be impossible to describe  it without a good deal of technical phraseology.    The tongue has always been considered such an important feature in a bee's  structure that it has been made the chief basis of their classification. On  this subject I will only say that there are three principal types of  tongues--a short bifid tongue (fig. 19, 3[1]), resembling those of the  fossors; a short pointed one, shaped somewhat like a spear head (fig. 19,  2, 2a); and a long parallel-sided, ribbon-like tongue (fig. 19, 1, 1a). The  bees are classified on what is considered to be an {73} ascending scale,  beginning with the bifid-tongued species, through those with the short  spear shaped tongues to the higher forms, which have this organ elongate  and parallel-sided.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    The tongue is the central organ of an elaborate combination of mouth parts,  which I will now try to explain. If we turn a bee's head over and look at  its underside we shall find a deep cavity, filled up with the base of this  combination which fits into it. If we extend the tongue (a humble bee is a  good subject on account of its large size, fig. 20) so as to draw its base  out of the cavity, we shall find that in the edge of each side of the  cavity there is articulated a short rod (20, A), more or less dilated at  its apex, called {74} the _stipes_; on the flattened ends of these rods  there swings a joint shaped something like the \"merrythought\" bone of a  chicken, called the _lora_ or reins (20, B), to the central angle of which  are suspended the pieces of the apparatus which terminate in the tongue.  This V-shaped joint can swing over on its feet, and can therefore lie  either between the _stipites_ or rods with its angle pointing towards the  tail of the bee, or in the opposite direction with its angle projecting  beyond them and pointing forwards. It will at once be seen that by this  turn of the V the tongue can be projected a distance equivalent to twice  the length of the V.    This V-shaped joint varies much in the length of its arms, which are much  longer in the long-tongued than in the short-tongued bees.    When we examine the parts that are suspended from this joint, we shall find  that the actual tongue is separated from it by two distinct pieces; the  first (i.e. that next to the _lora_) a short joint (the _submentum_, 20,  C), the second (the _mentum_, 20, D) a long semi-cylindrical joint which  holds as in a trough the softer parts at the base of the tongue. From the  apex of the _mentum_ {75} project three organs; the central one is the  actual tongue (or _ligula_, 20, E), and on each side are the organs which  are called the _labial palpi_ (20, F); these in the long-tongued bees more  or less fold over the base of the tongue and protect it. There are two  other large and important mouth parts called the _maxillae_ (20, G); these  articulate on to the flattened apices of the _cardines_, outside the  articulation of the feet of the _lora_, and extend on each side of the  _mentum_; they also have flattened blades sheathing, when closed, the whole  of the _mentum_ above, as well as the base of the tongue.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    So far we have been looking at the back of the head and mouth parts; if we  now look at the front we shall see the _maxillae_; if we open these we  shall see the tongue lying between the {76} labial palpi, and at the base  of the tongue we shall see two little sheaths called the _paraglossae_;  above these the softer parts lying in the trough of the _mentum_; from the  base of the _mentum_, connecting with the _maxillae_, there extends a  membrane which entirely invests the spaces between the bases of these  organs and extends up to the mouth. A membrane also extends between the  _stipites_ and _lora_, and closes the cavity at the back of the head. The  back of the tongue in the act of sucking can be formed into a tube through  which, partly, probably by capillary action, partly by the pumping action  caused by the dilating and contracting of certain parts of the mechanism,  the liquid food is drawn up into the aesophagus. This, I believe, has been  shown to be the principle on which all bees, short- or long-tongued, suck  up their honey. The subject could be treated at much greater length, and  many other structures connected with the mouth parts discussed, but more  minute details are unnecessary in an elementary work such as this, and I  have therefore limited myself to a description of the broad principles of  the process.           *       *       *       *       *    {77}    A DREADFUL PARASITE    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    Of all the evils to which bee flesh is heir, there can hardly be any so  terrible as the effects of the parasite _Stylops_ on the species of  _Andrena_ and _Halictus_ which it attacks. This very extraordinary  creature, which is now considered to be a beetle, lives during the early  stages of both sexes in the body of the bee, which it enters when the bee  is in the larval state. Its head protrudes like a minute flat seed between  the body segments (fig. 21), and so is visible externally, but the rest of  the creature, which is a grub-like larva, rests amongst the intestines of  the bee; the female matures in the bee's body and never leaves it. The  male, however, when mature, escapes, leaving the {78} [Illustration: FIG.  22. Stylops larva in abdominal cavity: after Perez.] great hole which he  inhabited open; he is provided with wings, and I have more than once caught  one flying in the open--but to return to our afflicted bee. This may be  attacked in either sex, and by one to five of the parasites. I have  specimens myself with four parasites in them, and a case of five has been  recorded. Mr. R. C. L. Perkins, writing on this subject, says: \"On removing  the integument dorsally from the bee, the large body of the female parasite  will be seen lying above the viscera, often almost entirely concealing  them\". If this is the condition of a bee nourishing only one parasite, I  must leave it to my readers to imagine the state of the poor wretch who is  supporting five! The outward appearance of one with several parasites is  generally much distorted; the abdomen is very much inflated, and the poor  creature is unable to fly any {79} distance, and can only crawl about, or  perhaps take short flights of a foot or so. The effects, however, seem "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#9)"],[1," _Junco hyemalis_      Col H:  _Zonotrichia querula_     ========================+==============================================                           |                   ANTISERA          ANTIGENS         +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----                           |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Passer domesticus_     |  75 |  74 |  73 |  66 |  81 |  72 | ... |  81   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Estrilda amandava_     | 100 |  88 |  75 | ... |  79 |  72 |  53 | ...   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Poephila guttata_      |  95 | 100 |  77 |  67 |  87 |  81 | ... | ...   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Molothrus ater_        |  66 |  54 |  69 |  65 |  86 |  75 |  69 |  75   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Piranga rubra_         | ... | ... | 100 | ... | ... | ... | ... |  89   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Richmondena cardinalis_|  75 |  80 |  91 | 100 |  98 |  65 |  88 |  91   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Spiza americana_       |  65 |  68 | ... |  71 | 100 |  64 |  67 |  80   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Carpodacus purpureus_  |  70 |  71 |  71 |  61 |  89 |  93 |  53 |  70   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Spinus tristis_        |  72 |  74 |  73 |  60 |  89 | 100 |  60 | ...   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Junco hyemalis_        |  64 |  56 |  74 |  65 |  87 | 68  | 100 | ...   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----   _Zonotrichia querula_   |  65 |  71 | ... |  67 |  89 | 75  | ... | 100   ------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----    Antigens were diluted with 0.9 per cent phosphate-buffered saline  solution. Tests were run in standard Kolmer test-tube racks, each test  consisting of 12 tubes. Each dilution was made on the basis of the  known protein concentration of the antigen. The first tube contained  an initial dilution of 1 part protein in 250 parts saline and each  successive tube contained a protein dilution one-half the  concentration of the preceding tube, ranging up to 1:512,000. Saline  controls, antiserum controls, and antigen controls were maintained  with each test to determine the turbidities inherent in these  solutions. These control-turbidities were deducted from the total  turbidity developed in each reaction-tube, the resultant turbidity  then being considered as that which was caused by the interaction of  antigens and antibodies. The turbidities were allowed to develop over  a 24-hour period. In the early stages of this investigation the  reactions were allowed to take place at 2 deg.C. in order to inhibit  bacterial growth.    Later tests were carried out at room temperatures, and bacterial  growth was prevented by the addition to each tube of 'Merthiolate' in  a final dilution of 1:10,000.      Experimental Data    Corrected values for the turbidities obtained were plotted with the  turbidity values on the ordinate and the antigen dilutions on the  abscissa. The homologous reaction was the standard of reference for  all other test reactions with the same antiserum. By summing the  plotted turbidity readings, numerical values are obtained which are  indices serving to characterize the curves. Such values were converted  to percentage values, that of the homologous reaction being considered  100 per cent. These values, plus the curves, provide the data by means  of which the proteins of the birds may be compared. Plots  representative of the precipitin curves are presented in Figs. 10 to  21. For convenience each plot represents only several of the 10 curves  obtained with each antiserum.    A summary of the serological relationships of the birds involved in  the precipitin tests is presented in Table 2, in which percentage  values are presented. Since the techniques involved in testing were  greatly improved as the investigation proceeded, the summary is based  solely on those tests run in the later stages of the investigation.  For reasons which will become apparent in later discussion, it should  be emphasized that in Table 2 comparisons may be made only within each  horizontal row of values.      Discussion of the Serological Investigations    One of the problems met early in this investigation was instability of  the proteins in the extracts that were prepared. Extracts in which no  attempt was made to inactivate the enzymes present proved  unsatisfactory. It was necessary to maintain the temperature of the  \"native\" antigens at 2 deg.C, and all work with such antigens had to be  performed at this temperature. This arrangement was inconvenient;  furthermore, inactivation of the enzymes was not complete even at this  low temperature, and some denaturation of the proteins took place as  evidenced by the gradual appearance of insoluble precipitates in the  stored vials.    The preservatives, 'Merthiolate' and formalin, were used in an attempt  to inhibit the autolytic action of the enzymes present. Formalin, when  added to make a final dilution of 0.4 per cent, proved to be the more  satisfactory of the two preservatives and was used throughout most of  the work. Formalin caused slight denaturation of some of the proteins,  but this effect was complete within a few hours, after which any  denatured material was removed by filtration or centrifugation. The  proteins remaining in solution were stable over the period necessary  to complete the investigations.    The addition of formalin reduces the reactivity of the extracts when  they are tested with antisera prepared against \"native\" antigens and  causes changes in the nature of the precipitin curves. This effect has  been pointed out by Horsfall (1934) and by Leone (1953) in their work  on the effects of formaldehyde on serum proteins. Their data indicate,  however, that even though changes in the immunological characteristics  of proteins are brought about by formolization, the proteins retain  enough of their specific chemical characteristics to allow consistent  differentiation of species by immunological methods. In the tests  which I performed, the relative positions of the precipitin curves,  whether native or formolized extracts were involved, remained  unchanged (Figs. 10, 11). _All data used in interpretation of the  serological relationships were obtained from tests in which formolized  antigens of equivalent age were used._    Only three antisera were produced against formolized antigens, all  others being produced against \"native\" extracts. The formolized  antigens seemed to have a greater antigenicity, in most instances,  than did those which were unformolized, and precipitin reactions  involving antisera produced against formolized antigens developed  higher turbidities. The antisera produced against formolized antigens  were equal to but no better than those prepared against \"native\"  extracts in separating the birds tested (Figs. 12, 13).    The rabbit is a variable to be considered in serological tests. Two  rabbits exposed to the same antigen, under the same conditions, may  produce antisera which differ greatly in their capacities to  distinguish different antigens. It is logical to assume, therefore,  that two rabbits exposed to different antigens may produce antisera  which also differ in this respect. This explains the unequal values of  reciprocal tests shown in Table 2. Thus, in the test involving the  antiserum to the extracts of _Richmondena_, a value of 71 per cent was  obtained for _Spiza_ antigen, whereas in the test involving  anti-_Spiza_ serum, a value of 98 per cent was obtained for  _Richmondena_ antigen. In Table 2, therefore, comparisons may be made  only among values for the proteins of birds tested with the same  antiserum.    Since the amount of any one antiserum is limited, there is, of  necessity, a limit as to the number of birds used in a series of  serological tests. Therefore, although the results reveal the actual  serological relationships of the individual species, interpretation of  the relationships of the taxonomic groups must be undertaken with the  realization that such an interpretation is based on tests involving  relatively few species of each group. It is reasonable to assume,  however, that a species which has been placed in a group on the basis  of resemblances other than serological resemblance would show greater  serological correspondence to other members of that group than it  would to members of other groups. Specifically, in the Fringillidae  and their allies, there seems to be little reason to doubt that  genera, and even subfamilies, are natural groups. This is illustrated  in tests involving closely related genera: _Richmondena_ and _Spiza_  (Figs. 14, 15, 18), _Estrilda_ and _Poephila_ (Fig. 21), _Spinus_ and  _Carpodacus_ (Figs. 12, 17, 19, 20). In each of these tests the pairs  of genera mentioned show greater serological correspondence to each  other than they do to other kinds involved. This point is illustrated  further by a test (not illustrated) involving _Zonotrichia querula_  (the homologous antigen) and _Zonotrichia albicollis_. Although this  test was one of an earlier series in which difficulties were  encountered (the data, therefore, were not used), it is of interest  that the two species were almost indistinguishable serologically.    The serological homogeneity of passeriform birds is emphasized by the  fact that the value of every heterologous reaction was more than 50  per cent of the value of the homologous reaction, except in the test  involving the anti-_Richmondena_ serum and"]]]
