CHAPTER VII    HYGIENE OF THE BONES.      129. _The bones increase in size and strength by use, while they are  weakened by inaction._ Exercise favors the deposition of both animal  and earthy matter, by increasing the circulation and nutrition in this  texture. For this reason, the bones of the laborer are dense and  strong, while those who neglect exercise, or are unaccustomed to  manual employment, are deficient in size, and have not a due  proportion of earthy matter to give them the solidity and strength of  the laboring man.    _Observation._ The tendons of the muscles are attached near the  extremities of the bones. Exercise of the muscles increases the action  of the vessels of that part to which the tendons are attached, and  thus increases the nutrition and size of this portion of the bone.  Hence the joints of an industrious mechanic or farmer are larger than  those of an individual who has not pursued manual vocations.    130. _The gelatinous bones of the child are not so well adapted for  labor and severe exercise as those of an adult._ 1st. They are liable  to become distorted. 2d. They are consolidated by the deposition of  earthy material before they are fully and properly developed. If a  young animal, as the colt, be put to severe, continued labor, the  deposition of earthy matter is hastened, and the bones are  consolidated before they attain full growth. Such colts make small and  inferior animals. Similar results follow, if a youth is compelled to  toil unduly before maturity of growth is attained. On the other hand,  moderate and regular labor favors a healthy development and  consolidation of the bones.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    129-148. _Give the hygiene of the bones._ 129. What effect has  exercise upon the bones? What effect has inaction? Why are the joints  of the industrious farmer and mechanic larger than those of a person  unaccustomed to manual employment? 130. Give the first reason why the  bones of the child are not adapted to severe exercise. The second  reason.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    131. _The kind and amount of labor should be adapted to the age,  health, and development of the bones._ Neither the flexible bones of  the child nor the brittle bones of the aged man are adapted, by their  organization, to long-continued, and hard labor. Those of the one bend  too easily, while those of the other fracture too readily. In middle  age, the proportions of animal and earthy matter are, usually, such as  to give the proper degree of flexibility, firmness, and strength for  labor, with little liability to injury.    132. _The imperfectly developed bones of the young child will not bear  long-continued exertions or positions without injury._ Hence the  requisitions of the rigid disciplinarian of schools, are unwise when  he compels his pupils to remain in one position for a long time. He  may have a \"quiet school;\" but, not unfrequently, by such discipline,  the constitution is impaired, and permanent injury is done to the  pupils.    133. _The lower extremities, in early life, contain but a small  proportion of earthy matter_; they bend when the weight of the body is  thrown upon them for a long time. Hence, the assiduous attempts to  induce children to stand or walk, either naturally or artificially,  when very young, are ill advised, and often productive of serious and  permanent evil. The \"bandy\" or bow legs are thus produced.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What effect has moderate, regular labor upon the growing youth? 131.  What remark respecting the kind and amount of labor? At what age are  the bones best fitted for labor? 132. What effect has long-continued  exertions or positions on the bones of a child? What is said of the  requisitions of some teachers, who have the famed \"quiet schools\"?  133. Why should not the child be induced to stand or walk, either  naturally or artificially, at too early an age?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    134. _The benches or chairs for children in a school-room should be of  such a height as to permit the feet to rest on the floor._ If the  bench is so high as not to permit the feet to rest upon the floor, the  weight of the limbs below the knee may cause the flexible bone of the  thigh to become curved. The child thus seated, is inclined to lean  forward, contracting an injurious and ungraceful habit. Again, when  the feet are not supported, the child soon becomes exhausted,  restless, and unfit for study. In the construction of a school-room,  the benches should be of different heights, so as to be adapted to the  different pupils, and they should also have appropriate backs.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. The position assumed when the seat is of proper  height, and the feet supported.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30. The position a child naturally assumes when the  seat is so high that the feet are not supported.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    134. What is said of the benches or chairs in a school-room? What is  represented by fig. 29? By fig. 30? What is the effect when the lower  limbs are not supported?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    135. _Compression of the chest should be avoided._ In children, and  also in adults, the ribs are very flexible, and a small amount of  pressure will increase their curvature, particularly at the lower part  of the chest, and thus lessen the size of this cavity. The lower ribs  are united to the breast-bone, by long, yielding cartilages, and  compression may not only contract the chest, but an unseemly and  painful ridge may be produced, by the bending of the cartilages, on  one or both sides of the sternum.    [Illustration: Fig. 31. A natural and well-proportioned chest.]    [Illustration: Fig. 32. A chest fashionably deformed.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    135. Why should compression of the chest be avoided? What is  represented by fig. 31? By fig. 32?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    136. Again, the cartilages on one side may be bent outward, while  those on the opposite side are bent inward, thus forming a depression  parallel with the sternum. In some instances, the anterior extremity  of the lower ribs on each side are brought nearly or quite together.  In these instances, the movable extremities of the ribs are drawn down  toward the haunch-bones, while the space between the ribs is lessened.  All this may be effected by tight or \"snug\" clothing. Therefore the  apparel of a child should be loose, and supported over the shoulders,  to avoid the before-mentioned evils. The same may be said of the  clothing for adults.    137. _The erect position in sitting and standing should be assiduously  observed._ The spinal column, in its natural position, curves from  front to back, but not from side to side The admirable arrangement of  the bones, alternating with cartilages, permits a great variety of  motions and positions; and when the spine is inclined to either side,  the elasticity of its cartilages tends to restore it to its natural  position. For this reason we may incline the spinal column in any  direction for a short time, without danger of permanent curvature, if,  afterward, the erect position is assumed.[4]       [4] Compare 1, 1, Fig. 28, with 2, 2, 2, Fig. 48.    138. But if a stooping position, or a lateral curved posture, is  continued for a long time, the spinal column does not easily recover  its proper position, for the compressed edges of the cartilages lose  their power of reaction, and finally one side of the cartilage becomes  thinned, while the other is thickened; and these wedge-shaped  cartilages produce a permanent curvature of the spinal column. In a  similar way, the student, seamstress, artisan, and mechanic acquire a  stooping position, and become round shouldered, by inclining forward  to bring their books or work nearer the eyes.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    136. May simply \"snug\" clothing compress the cartilages? How should  the apparel of a child be worn? 137. In what direction does the spinal  column, in its natural position, curve? What restores it to its  natural position when curved laterally? 138. What is the effect if a  lateral curved position of the spinal column is continued for a long  time? 139. When one shoulder is elevated for a long time, what is the  effect upon the spinal column?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    139. Pupils, while writing, drawing, and sometimes while studying,  frequently incline the spinal column to one side, in order to  accommodate themselves to the desks at which they are seated. Often,  these are higher than the elbow as it hangs from the shoulder while at  rest. This attitude elevates one shoulder while it depresses the  other; consequently, the upper part of the spinal column is inclined  toward the elevated shoulder, and the lower part is curved in the  opposite direction, giving the form of the letter _S_ to the  supporting column of the body.    [Illustration: Fig. 33. The table is of proper height, the position is  correct, and the spinal column, 1, 1, is straight, while the shoulders  are of equal height.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What does fig. 33 represent?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Experiment._ Let a pupil be placed at a desk or table with one elbow  raised, as is frequently seen while writing, or at study, and observe  the condition of the shoulder and spinal column in this position.  Place another pupil at a table no higher than the elbow when it hangs  by the side while sitting, and observe the appearance of the shoulders  and spinal column.

Of others I have  but two servants, whom thou wilt see; and the one is a strange creature,  who should scare thee or scathe thee with a good will, but of a good will  shall serve nought save me; the other is a woman, a thrall, of little  avail, save that, being compelled, she will work woman's service for me,  but whom none else shall compel . . . Yea, but what is all this to thee;  or to me that I should tell it to thee?  I will not drive thee away; but  if thine entertainment please thee not, make no plaint thereof to me, but  depart at thy will.  Now is this talk betwixt us overlong, since, as thou  seest, I and this King's Son are in converse together.  Art thou a King's  Son?\"    \"Nay, Lady,\" said Walter, \"I am but of the sons of the merchants.\"    \"It matters not,\" she said; \"go thy ways into one of the chambers.\"    And straightway she fell a-talking to the man who sat beside her  concerning the singing of the birds beneath her window in the morning;  and of how she had bathed her that day in a pool of the woodlands, when  she had been heated with hunting, and so forth; and all as if there had  been none there save her and the King's Son.    But Walter departed all ashamed, as though he had been a poor man thrust  away from a rich kinsman's door; and he said to himself that this woman  was hateful, and nought love-worthy, and that she was little like to  tempt him, despite all the fairness of her body.    No one else he saw in the house that even; he found meat and drink duly  served on a fair table, and thereafter he came on a goodly bed, and all  things needful, but no child of Adam to do him service, or bid him  welcome or warning.  Nevertheless he ate, and drank, and slept, and put  off thought of all these things till the morrow, all the more as he hoped  to see the kind maiden some time betwixt sunrise and sunset on that new  day.          CHAPTER XII: THE WEARING OF FOUR DAYS IN THE WOOD BEYOND THE WORLD      He arose betimes, but found no one to greet him, neither was there any  sound of folk moving within the fair house; so he but broke his fast, and  then went forth and wandered amongst the trees, till he found him a  stream to bathe in, and after he had washed the night off him he lay down  under a tree thereby for a while, but soon turned back toward the house,  lest perchance the Maid should come thither and he should miss her.    It should be said that half a bow-shot from the house on that side (i.e.  due north thereof) was a little hazel-brake, and round about it the trees  were smaller of kind than the oaks and chestnuts he had passed through  before, being mostly of birch and quicken-beam and young ash, with small  wood betwixt them; so now he passed through the thicket, and, coming to  the edge thereof, beheld the Lady and the King's Son walking together  hand in hand, full lovingly by seeming.    He deemed it unmeet to draw back and hide him, so he went forth past them  toward the house.  The King's Son scowled on him as he passed, but the  Lady, over whose beauteous face flickered the joyous morning smiles, took  no more heed of him than if he had been one of the trees of the wood.  But  she had been so high and disdainful with him the evening before, that he  thought little of that.  The twain went on, skirting the hazel-copse, and  he could not choose but turn his eyes on them, so sorely did the Lady's  beauty draw them.  Then befell another thing; for behind them the boughs  of the hazels parted, and there stood that little evil thing, he or  another of his kind; for he was quite unclad, save by his fell of yellowy-  brown hair, and that he was girt with a leathern girdle, wherein was  stuck an ugly two-edged knife: he stood upright a moment, and cast his  eyes at Walter and grinned, but not as if he knew him; and scarce could  Walter say whether it were the one he had seen, or another: then he cast  himself down on his belly, and fell to creeping through the long grass  like a serpent, following the footsteps of the Lady and her lover; and  now, as he crept, Walter deemed, in his loathing, that the creature was  liker to a ferret than aught else.  He crept on marvellous swiftly, and  was soon clean out of sight.  But Walter stood staring after him for a  while, and then lay down by the copse-side, that he might watch the house  and the entry thereof; for he thought, now perchance presently will the  kind maiden come hither to comfort me with a word or two.  But hour  passed by hour, and still she came not; and still he lay there, and  thought of the Maid, and longed for her kindness and wisdom, till he  could not refrain his tears, and wept for the lack of her.  Then he  arose, and went and sat in the porch, and was very downcast of mood.    But as he sat there, back comes the Lady again, the King's Son leading  her by the hand; they entered the porch, and she passed by him so close  that the odour of her raiment filled all the air about him, and the  sleekness of her side nigh touched him, so that he could not fail to note  that her garments were somewhat disarrayed, and that she kept her right  hand (for her left the King's Son held) to her bosom to hold the cloth  together there, whereas the rich raiment had been torn off from her right  shoulder.  As they passed by him, the King's Son once more scowled on  him, wordless, but even more fiercely than before; and again the Lady  heeded him nought.    After they had gone on a while, he entered the hall, and found it empty  from end to end, and no sound in it save the tinkling of the fountain;  but there was victual set on the board.  He ate and drank thereof to keep  life lusty within him, and then went out again to the wood-side to watch  and to long; and the time hung heavy on his hands because of the lack of  the fair Maiden.    He was of mind not to go into the house to his rest that night, but to  sleep under the boughs of the forest.  But a little after sunset he saw a  bright-clad image moving amidst the carven images of the porch, and the  King's Son came forth and went straight to him, and said: \"Thou art to  enter the house, and go into thy chamber forthwith, and by no means to go  forth of it betwixt sunset and sunrise.  My Lady will not away with thy  prowling round the house in the night-tide.\"    Therewith he turned away, and went into the house again; and Walter  followed him soberly, remembering how the Maid had bidden him forbear.  So  he went to his chamber, and slept.    But amidst of the night he awoke and deemed that he heard a voice not far  off, so he crept out of his bed and peered around, lest, perchance, the  Maid had come to speak with him; but his chamber was dusk and empty: then  he went to the window and looked out, and saw the moon shining bright and  white upon the greensward.  And lo! the Lady walking with the King's Son,  and he clad in thin and wanton raiment, but she in nought else save what  God had given her of long, crispy yellow hair.  Then was Walter ashamed  to look on her, seeing that there was a man with her, and gat him back to  his bed; but yet a long while ere he slept again he had the image before  his eyes of the fair woman on the dewy moonlit grass.    The next day matters went much the same way, and the next also, save that  his sorrow was increased, and he sickened sorely of hope deferred.  On  the fourth day also the forenoon wore as erst; but in the heat of the  afternoon Walter sought to the hazel-copse, and laid him down there hard  by a little clearing thereof, and slept from very weariness of grief.  There, after a while, he woke with words still hanging in his ears, and  he knew at once that it was they twain talking together.    The King's Son had just done his say, and now it was the Lady beginning  in her honey-sweet voice, low but strong, wherein even was a little of  huskiness; she said: \"Otto, belike it were well to have a little  patience, till we find out what the man is, and whence he cometh; it will  always be easy to rid us of him; it is but a word to our Dwarf-king, and  it will be done in a few minutes.\"    \"Patience!\" said the King's Son, angrily; \"I wot not how to have patience  with him; for I can see of him that he is rude and violent and  headstrong, and a low-born wily one.  Forsooth, he had patience enough  with me the other even, when I rated him in, like the dog that he is, and  he had no manhood to say one word to me.  Soothly, as he followed after  me, I had a mind to turn about and deal him a buffet on the face, to see  if I could but draw one angry word from him.\"    The Lady laughed, and said: \"Well, Otto, I know not; that which thou  deemest dastardy in him may be but prudence and wisdom, and he an alien,  far from his friends and nigh to his foes.  Perchance we shall yet try  him what he is.  Meanwhile, I rede thee try him not with buffets, save he  be weaponless and with bounden hands; or else I deem that but a little  while shalt thou be fain of thy blow.\"    Now when Walter heard her words and the voice wherein they were said, he  might not forbear being stirred by them, and to him, all lonely there,  they seemed friendly.    But he lay still, and the King's Son answered the Lady and said: \"I know  not what is in thine heart concerning this runagate, that thou shouldst  bemock me with his valiancy, whereof thou knowest nought.  If thou deem  me unworthy of thee, send me back safe to my father's country; I may look  to have worship there; yea, and the love of fair women belike.\"    Therewith it seemed as if he had put forth his hand to the Lady to caress  her, for she said: \"Nay, lay not thine hand on my shoulder, for to-day  and now it is not the hand of love, but of pride and folly, and would-be  mastery.  Nay, neither shalt thou rise up and leave me until thy mood is  softer and kinder to me.\"    Then was there silence betwixt them a while, and thereafter the King's  Son spake in a wheedling"]]]
