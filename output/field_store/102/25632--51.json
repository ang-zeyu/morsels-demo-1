If the Lord made a covenant in  the days of the Apostles, called a new covenant, why should that  covenant still be renewed again, seeing it is in full force, until it  is broken by one party or the other?\" This is an important inquiry,  involving the fate of all Christendom in its decision; we must  therefore be very careful to make the decision perfectly plain, and  the proof easy to be understood. That there was a covenant made  between God and the people in the days of Christ and His Apostles,  none will attempt to deny, and if that covenant never has been broken,  it must be of force to the present day, and consequently there is no  need of a new one. It therefore remains for us to prove that that  covenant has been broken, completely broken, so that it is not in  force, either among Jews or Gentiles, having lost its offices,  authorities, powers, and blessings, insomuch that they are nowhere to  be found among men. In order to do this, we must examine what were its  offices, authorities, powers, and blessings, and then see whether they  are still known among men.    We read that its offices consisted of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists,  Pastors, and Teachers, all inspired and set in the Church, by the Lord  Himself, for the edifying of the saints, for the work of the ministry,  etc. And they were to continue in the Church, wherever it was found,  until they all came to the unity of the faith, and unto the measure of  the stature of a man in Christ.    Secondly, the gifts of the Spirit, which some call supernatural, were  the powers and blessings which pertained to that covenant, wherever it  existed, among the Jews or the Gentiles, so long as the covenant was  of force. Now, I would ask the world of Christendom, or either of its  sects or parties, if they have Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists,  Pastors and Teachers inspired from on high, together with all the  gifts and blessings of the Holy Spirit, which pertained to the Gospel  covenant? If not, then the offices and powers of that covenant have  been lost. And it must be through the breaking of that covenant that  they were lost, for in this way the Jews lost these privileges, when  they were handed to the Gentiles. And Paul told the Gentiles, in his  eleventh chapter to the Romans, that if they did not abide in the  goodness of God, they would fall, as the Jews had done before them.    But in order to prove, by further demonstration, that the Gospel  covenant has been broken, by Jew and Gentile, and all people, so as to  be no longer in force, I shall quote Isaiah, xxiv, 1-6: \"Behold, the  Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it  upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. And it  shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant,  so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with  the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the  borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to  him. The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the  Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the  world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do  languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;  BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRANSGRESSED THE LAWS, CHANGED THE ORDINANCE, BROKEN  THE EVERLASTING COVENANT. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth,  and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of  the earth are burned, and few men left.\" In these few verses, we  discover a like calamity awaiting priests and people, rich and poor,  bond and free, insomuch that they are all to be burned up but a few;  and the complaint is that the earth is defiled under the inhabitants  thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the  ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant. Now this could not be  speaking of any other than the covenant, ordinance, and laws of the  Gospel, made with the people in the days of the Apostles; because,  however any former covenant may have been broken, yet the inhabitants  of the earth have never been destroyed by fire, all but a few, for  having broken any previous covenant. But this destruction is to come  by fire, as literally as the flood in the days of Noah; and it will  consume both priests and people from the earth, and that, too, for  having broken the covenant of the Gospel, with its laws and its  ordinances; or else we must get a new edition of the Bible, leaving  out the twenty-fourth of Isaiah.    Now, having settled this question, I trust the reader will see the  need of a new covenant, in order to save the few that are not to be  burned. We will therefore drop this subject for the present, and turn  again to the subject of the gathering of Israel. You will please turn  and read the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth, and  thirty-ninth chapters of Ezekiel. In the thirty-sixth chapter you will  discover a promise that Israel are to return from all the nations  whither they have been scattered, and to be brought again to the land  which God gave to their fathers; Jerusalem is to be filled with flocks  of men, and all the desolate cities of Judea are to be rebuilt, fenced  and inhabited; the land is to be fenced, tilled and sown, insomuch  that they shall say: \"This land that was desolate is become like the  garden of Eden.\" \"I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it; and the  heathen shall know that I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant  that that was desolate.\" \"So shall the waste cities be filled with  flocks of men, and they shall know that I am the Lord.\" In the  thirty-seventh chapter you will find, after the vision of the  resurrection of the dead, the Prophet goes on to speak of the two  nations becoming one nation upon the mountains of Israel, and one king  being king to them all; and when this takes place, they are no more to  be divided into two kingdoms. Moreover, the Lord's tabernacle is to be  with them, and His sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore. He will  forever be their God, and they shall be His people. \"And the heathen  shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall  be in the midst of them forevermore.\" Now, it is a fact well known,  that Judah and the ten tribes have never been one nation, upon the  mountains of Israel, since the day they were first divided into two  nations.    But, when this does take place, even the very heathen are to know it,  and are to be convinced of the true God, as was Cyrus. Now if the  missionaries should convert the world, before the Lord does this great  work, then it will save the Lord the trouble of doing it in His own  way, and it will save the trouble of fulfilling the Prophets, and the  word of the Lord will fail, and all the world lay hold of infidelity.  Well did the Lord say: \"My ways are not as your ways, nor my thoughts  as your thoughts.\" Chapters xxxviii and xxxix present us with a view  of many nations united under one great head, whom the Lord is pleased  to call Gog; and being mounted on horseback, and armed with all sorts  of armor, they come up against the mountains of Israel, as a cloud to  cover the land; their object is to take a prey, to take away silver  and gold, and cattle, and goods in great abundance.    This is an event which is to transpire after the return of the Jews,  and the rebuilding of Jerusalem; while the towns and the land of Judea  are without walls, having neither bars nor gates. But while they are  at the point to swallow up the Jews, and lay waste their country,  behold the Lord's fury comes up in His face, a mighty earthquake is  the result, insomuch that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the  air, and all the creeping things, and all men upon the face of the  earth, shall shake at His presence, and every wall shall fall to the  ground, and every man's sword shall be turned against his neighbor in  this army, and the Lord shall rain upon Gog, and upon his bands, and  upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, great  hailstones, fire and brimstone. And thus He will magnify Himself, and  sanctify Himself, in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know  that He is the Lord; thus they shall fall upon the open field, upon  the mountains of Israel, even Gog and all his army, horses and  horsemen; and the Jews shall go forth and gather the weapons of war,  such as handstaves, spears, shields, bows and arrows; and these  weapons shall last the cities of Israel seven years for fuel, so that  they shall cut no wood out of the forest, for they shall burn the  weapons with the fire; and they shall spoil those that spoiled them,  and rob those that robbed them, and they shall gather gold and silver,  and apparel, in great abundance.    At this time the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the field shall  have a great feast; yea, they are to eat fat until they be full, and  drink blood until they be drunken. They are to eat the flesh of  captains, and kings, and mighty men, and all men of war. But the Jews  will have a very serious duty to perform, which will take no less than  seven months; namely, the burying of their enemies. They will select a  place on the east side of the sea, called the Valley of the  Passengers, and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude, and  they shall call it the Valley of Hamon Gog. And the scent shall go  forth, insomuch that it shall stop the noses of the passengers; thus  shall they cleanse the land. \"And I will set my glory among the  heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have  executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them: so the house of  Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#9)"],[1,"to study the law of nations and foreign languages.  I accordingly repaired to Leipsic, about the time when the French  Revolution broke out.    I spent some time at Leipsic, where I applied myself to the study of  the law of nations, and the German and English languages. I afterwards  travelled through Prussia and Poland, and passed a part of the winter  of 1791 and 1792 at Warsaw, where I was most graciously received by  Princess Tyszicwiez, niece of Stanislaus Augustus, the last King of  Poland, and the sister of Prince Poniatowski. The Princess was very  well informed, and was a great admirer of French literature: At her  invitation I passed several evenings in company with the King in a  circle small enough to approach to something like intimacy. I remember  that his Majesty frequently asked me to read the Moniteur; the speeches  to which he listened with the greatest pleasure were those of the  Girondists. The Princess Tyszicwiez wished to print at Warsaw, at her  own expense, a translation I had executed of Kotzebue's 'Menschenhass  and Reue, to which I gave the title of 'L'Inconnu'.         --[A play known on the English stage as The Stranger.]--    I arrived at Vienna on the 26th of March 1792, when I was informed  of the serious illness of the Emperor, Leopold II, who died on the  following day. In private companies, and at public places, I heard vague  suspicions expressed of his having been poisoned; but the public, who  were admitted to the palace to see the body lie in state, were soon  convinced of the falsehood of these reports. I went twice to see the  mournful spectacle, and I never heard a word which was calculated to  confirm the odious suspicion, though the spacious hall in which the  remains of the Emperor were exposed was constantly thronged with people.    In the month of April 1792 I returned to Paris, where I again met  Bonaparte,         --[Bonaparte is said, on very doubtful authority, to have spent five     or six weeks in London in 1791 or 1792, and to have \"lodged in a     house in George Street, Strand. His chief occupation appeared to be     taking pedestrian exercise in the streets of London--hence his     marvellous knowledge of the great metropolis which used to astonish     any Englishmen of distinction who were not aware of this visit. He     occasionally took his cup of chocolate at the 'Northumberland,'     occupying himself in reading, and preserving a provoking taciturnity     to the gentlemen in the room; though his manner was stern, his     deportment was that of a gentleman.\" The story of his visit is     probably as apocryphal as that of his offering his services to the     English Government when the English forces wore blockading the coast     of Corsica,]--    and our college intimacy was fully renewed. I was not very well off, and  adversity was hanging heavily on him; his resources frequently failed  him. We passed our time like two young fellows of twenty-three who have  little money and less occupation. Bonaparte was always poorer than  I. Every day we conceived some new project or other. We were on the  look-out for some profitable speculation. At one time he wanted me to  join him in renting several houses, then building in the Rue Montholon,  to underlet them afterwards. We found the demands of the landlords  extravagant--everything failed.    At the same time he was soliciting employment at the War Office, and I  at the office of Foreign Affairs. I was for the moment the luckier of  the two.    While we were spending our time in a somewhat vagabond way,         --[It was before the 20th of June that in our frequent excursions     around Paris we went to St. Cyr to see his sister Marianne (Elisa).     We returned to dine alone at Trianon.--Bourrienne.]--    the 20th of June arrived. We met by appointment at a restaurateur's  in the Rue St. Honore, near the Palais Royal, to take one of our daily  rambles. On going out we saw approaching, in the direction of the  market, a mob, which Bonaparte calculated at five or six thousand  men. They were all in rags, ludicrously armed with weapons of every  description, and were proceeding hastily towards the Tuilleries,  vociferating all kinds of gross abuse. It was a collection of all that  was most vile and abject in the purlieus of Paris. \"Let us follow the  mob,\" said Bonaparte. We got the start of them, and took up our station  on the terrace of the banks of the river. It was there that he witnessed  the scandalous scenes which took place; and it would be difficult to  describe the surprise and indignation which they excited in him. When  the King showed himself at the windows overlooking the garden, with the  red cap, which one of the mob had put on his head, he could no longer  repress his indignation. \"Che coglione!\" he loudly exclaimed. \"Why have  they let in all that rabble! They should sweep off four or five hundred  of them with the cannon; the rest would then set off fast enough.\"    When we sat down to dinner, which I paid for, as I generally did, for  I was the richer of the two, he spoke of nothing but the scene we  had witnessed. He discussed with great good sense the causes and  consequences of this unrepressed insurrection. He foresaw and developed  with sagacity all that would ensue. He was not mistaken. The 10th of  August soon arrived. I was then at Stuttgart, where I was appointed  Secretary of Legation.    At St. Helena Bonaparte said, \"On the news of the attack of the  Tuilleries, on the 10th of August, I hurried to Fauvelet, Bourrienne's  brother, who then kept a furniture warehouse at the Carrousel.\" This  is partly correct. My brother was connected with what was termed an  'enterprise d'encan national', where persons intending to quit France  received an advance of money, on depositing any effects which they  wished to dispose of, and which were sold for them immediately.  Bonaparte had some time previously pledged his watch in this way.    After the fatal 10th of August Bonaparte went to Corsica, and did not  return till 1793. Sir Walter Scott says that after that time he never  saw Corsica again. This is a mistake, as will be shown when I speak of  his return from Egypt.         --[Sir Walter appears to have collected his information for the Life     of Napoleon only from those libels and vulgar stories which     gratified the calumnious spirit and national hatred. His work is     written with excessive negligence, which, added to its numerous     errors, shows how much respect he must have entertained for his     readers. It would appear that his object was to make it the inverse     of his novels, where everything is borrowed from history. I have     been assured that Marshal Macdonald having offered to introduce     Scott to some generals who could have furnished him with the most     accurate, information respecting military events, the glory of which     they had shared, Sir Walter replied, \"I thank you, but I shall     collect my information from unprofessional reports.\"--Bourrienne.]--    Having been appointed Secretary of Legation to Stuttgart, I set off for  that place on the 2d of August, and I did not again see my ardent young  friend until 1795. He told me that my departure accelerated his for  Corsica. We separated, as may be supposed, with but faint hopes of ever  meeting again.    By a decree of the 28th of March of 1793, all French agents abroad were  ordered to return to France, within three months, under pain of being  regarded as emigrants. What I had witnessed before my departure for  Stuttgart, the excitement in which I had left the public mind, and the  well-known consequences of events of this kind, made me fear that  I should be compelled to be either an accomplice or a victim in the  disastrous scenes which were passing at home. My disobedience of the law  placed my name on the list of emigrants.    It has been said of me, in a biographical publication, that \"it was as  remarkable as it was fortunate for Bourrienne that, on his return, he  got his name erased from the list of emigrants of the department of  the Yonne, on which it had been inscribed during his first journey to  Germany. This circumstance has been interpreted in several different  ways, which are not all equally favourable to M. de Bourrienne.\"    I do not understand what favourable interpretations can be put upon a  statement entirely false. General Bonaparte repeatedly applied for the  erasure of my name, from the month of April 1797, when I rejoined him  at Leoben, to the period of the signature of the treaty of Campo-Formio;  but without success. He desired his brother Louis, Berthier, Bernadotte,  and others, when he sent them to the Directory, to urge my erasure; but  in vain. He complained of this inattention to his wishes to Bottot,  when he came to Passeriano, after the 18th Fructidor. Bottot, who was  secretary to Barras, was astonished that I was not erased, and he made  fine promises of what he would do. On his return to France he wrote to  Bonaparte: \"Bourrienne is erased.\" But this was untrue. I was not  erased until November 1797, upon the reiterated solicitations of General  Bonaparte.    It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of  'chef de bataillon', performed his first campaign, and contributed so  materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I  have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall not speak of it as an  eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval  between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which  he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production,  entitled 'Le Souper de Beaucaire', the copies of which he bought up at  considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate.  This little pamphlet contains principles very opposite to those he  wished to see established in 1800, a period when extravagant ideas of  liberty were no"]]]
