Cramer (who has just been nominated) has  obtained the cross.    In any case I think that you, like every one else, will approve  of a nomination so perfectly legitimate.    As to myself, if it be true that my name has figured in the list  of candidates, this can only have occurred entirely without my  knowledge. It has always seemed to me that distinctions of this  sort could only be accepted, but never \"asked for.\"    I am, sir, etc.,    F. Liszt    London, May 14th, 1840        27. To Franz von Schober    [London, May or June, 1840]    My worthy friend,    A fortnight ago my mother wrote me word that she had given  several letters, which had come for me from Germany, to a  gentleman who was to bring them to me to London. I suppose there  was one from you among the number, but up to now I have not  received anything.    Allow me to repeat once more the request, which I have already  made to you, to come for some time with me (a year or two, and  more if you can); for I feel deeply that, the more we are  separated by time and space, the more my thoughts and my heart go  out to you. I have rarely felt this so strongly, and my wish to  feel you settled with me grows daily stronger.    Moreover the persuasion that I feel that we should pass a happy  and serious life together, makes me again press you further.    Try then to be at liberty as soon as possible, and once for all  make a frank and friendly resolve. I assure you that it will not  be difficult to ameliorate, by each other, our two lives, which  in their different ways are sad and bad thus separated.    Let me have two words in reply on this point--which, to tell the  truth, is the only important one for us both at this moment.  Speak quite freely to me, and depend on me thoroughly.    Yours ever,    F. Liszt    Address care of Erard, 18, Great Marlborough Street.    Need I again assure you that any question will not be a question  between us?        28. To Franz von Schober    Stonehenge, Salisbury, August 29th, 1840    It is with an unspeakable feeling of sadness and vexation that I  write to you today, my dear good friend! Your letter had done me  so much good; I was so happy at the thought of our meeting at the  end of the autumn at latest; I wanted so to feel that I could  rest on your arm, and that your heart, so full of kindness and  brotherly help, was near me,--and, lo and behold! I am obliged to  give it up, or at least to put it off...    An unfortunate engagement which I have just renewed, and which  will keep me in England till the end of January, makes it  impossible for me to say to you the one word which I wish to say,  \"Come!\"--    England is not like any other country; the expenses are enormous.  I really dare not ask you to travel with me here, for it would  almost ruin us. Moreover we should hardly be able to be together,  for I have three or four compulsory companions, from whom it is  impossible for me to separate. I hoped to have done with all that  by the beginning of October, but now I have to begin again in the  middle of November. If I have time to make my journey to Russia  this year it will be the utmost I can do, but it is a journey  that I am in a way obliged to make after the gracious invitation  of Her Majesty the Empress at Ems. On the 15th of next May I  return again to London, probably by the steamer coming direct  from St. Petersburg.    Where shall I find you in a year--fifteen months? It is very  possible that I shall come and look for you in Vienna, but then I  shall assuredly not leave without taking you with me.    I have some thoughts of spending the following winter at  Constantinople. I am tired of the West; I want to breathe  perfumes, to bask in the sun, to exchange the smoke of coal for  the sweet smoke of the narghileh [Turkish pipe]. In short, I am  pining for the East! O my morning land! O my Aborniko!--    My uncle writes that you have been very good and obliging to him.  I thank you warmly.--Do you meet Castelli from time to time? When  you see him beg him from me to translate the article I published  in the Paris \"Revue Musicale\" (of August 23rd) on Paganini, and  to get it put into the \"Theater-Zeitung\". I should be very glad  also if it could be translated into Hungarian, for the Hirnok  (excuse me if I make a mess of the word!), but I do not know who  could do it.    A propos of Hungarian! I shall always value highly the work on my  sojourn in Pest. Send it me as soon as you possibly can, and  address it to Madame la Comtesse d'Agoult, 10, Rue Neuve des  Mathurins, Paris. Most affectionate remembrances to Kriehuber.  His two portraits of me have been copied in London. They are  without doubt the best.    Adieu, my dear excellent Schober. In my next letter I shall ask  you about a matter of some consequence. It is about a Cantata for  Beethoven, which I should like to set to music and to have it  given at the great Festival which we expect to organize in 1842  for the inauguration of the Statue at Bonn.    Yours ever most affectionately,    F. Liszt        29. To Buloz    [Published in Ramann's \"Franz Liszt,\" vol. ii., I.]    Editor of the Revue des Deux Mondes.    Sir,    In your Revue Musicale for October last my name was mixed up with  the outrageous pretensions and exaggerated success of some  executant artists; I take the liberty to address a few remarks to  you on this subject. [The enthusiastic demonstrations which had  been made to him in Hungary, his native land, had been put into a  category with the homage paid to singers and dancers, and the  bestowal of the sabre had been turned into special ridicule.  Liszt repelled this with justifiable pride.]    The wreaths thrown at the feet of Mesdemoiselles Elssler and  Pixis by the amateurs of New York and Palermo are striking  manifestations of the enthusiasm of a public; the sabre which was  given to me at Pest is a reward given by a NATION in an entirely  national form. In Hungary, sir, in that country of antique and  chivalrous manners, the sabre has a patriotic signification. It  is the special token of manhood; it is the weapon of every man  who has a right to carry a weapon. When six of the chief men of  note in my country presented me with it among the general  acclamations of my compatriots, whilst at the same moment the  towns of Pest and Oedenburg conferred upon me the freedom of the  city, and the civic authorities of Pest asked His Majesty for  letters of nobility for me, it was an act to acknowledge me  afresh as a Hungarian, after an absence of fifteen years; it was  a reward of some slight services rendered to Art in my country;  it was especially, and so I felt it, to unite me gloriously to  her by imposing on me serious duties, and obligations for life as  man and as artist.    I agree with you, sir, that it was, without doubt, going far  beyond my deserts up to the present time. Therefore I saw in that  solemnity the expression of a hope far more than of a  satisfaction. Hungary hailed in me the man from whom she expects  artistic illustriousness, after all the illustrious soldiers and  politicians she has so plentifully produced. As a child I  received from my country precious tokens of interest, and the  means of going abroad to develop my artistic vocation. When grown  up, and after long years, the young man returns to bring her the  fruits of his work and the future of his will, the enthusiasm of  the hearts which open to receive him and the expression of a  national joy must not be confounded with the frantic  demonstrations of an audience of amateurs.    In placing these two things side by side it seems tome there is  something which must wound a just national pride and sympathies  by which I am honored.    Be so kind as to insert these few lines in your next issue, and  believe me, sir,    Yours obediently,    Franz Liszt    Hamburg, October 26th, 1840        30. To Franz von Schober    I will write German to you, dear Schober, in order to tell you  all the quicker how much your letter pleased me. I have to thank  it for a really happy hour; and that comes so rarely in my  intolerable, monotonous life! For a fortnight past I have again  put my neck into the English yoke. Every day which God gives--a  concert, with a journey, previously, of thirty to fifty miles.  And so it must continue at least till the end of January. What do  you say to that?--    If I am not more than half-dead, I must still go at the end of  February to Berlin and Petersburg,--and come back to London by  the first steamer at the beginning of May. Then I think I shall  take a rest. Where and how I do not yet know, and it depends  entirely upon the Pecuniary results of my journeys. I should like  to go to Switzerland, and thence to Venice, but I can't yet say  anything definite.    .--. I have today written a long letter to Leo Festetics. I am  hungering and thirsting to go back to Hungary. Every recollection  of it has taken deep root in my soul...And yet I cannot go back!    I am grieved that you can tell me nothing better of Lannoy. I  cannot understand how that is possible. The news of the Queen has  given me great pleasure--if you hear anything more about her let  me know. I have a kind of weakness for her.    About the Cantata I will write to you fully later.    Farewell, and be happy if possible, dear Schober; write again  soon, and remain ever my friend.    F. L.    Excuse the spelling and writing of these lines! You know that I  never write German; Tobias [Tobias Haslinger, the Vienna music  publisher.] is, I think, the only one who gets German letters  from me.    Manchester, December 5th, 1840        31. To Breitkopf and Hartel    London, May 7th, 1841    Schlesinger has just told me that Mendelssohn's Melodies which I  sent you from London have come out. I can't tell you, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],[0,"Marvels of Pond-life (#9)"],[1,"weed. There were likewise specimens of the  long-necked animalcules (Trachelii), groups of Vorticella, some  specimens of Volvox, and a small _Trichodina pediculus_, which, when  magnified two hundred and sixty linear, was about the size of a sixpence  and equally round. The edge was beautifully fringed with a circle of  cilia; in an inner circle was a row of locomotive organs, and the centre  exhibited vacuoles constantly opening and shutting. This creature, as  before explained, is often found as a parasite upon the polyps. On one  occasion a glimpse was caught of a Rotifer similar in shape to the  common wheel animalcule, but with a yellow inside. Possibly it was the  object so beautifully delineated by Mr. Gosse, in his \"Tenby,\" and  described as the \"Yellow Philodine,\" but this must remain in doubt, as  it managed to escape before it could be secured.    [Illustration: A. Cothurnia imberbis--('Micrograph. Dict.') B and C. The  specimens described in text. The figures give the _linear_  magnification.]    By the 18th of the month the Vorticellids were much more plentiful, and  their changes easily watched; many left their stalks while under the  microscope, after which some rushed about like animated and demented  hats, others twirled round like tee-to-tums, while others took a rest  before commencing their wild career. But the common Vorticellae were not  the only or the most interesting representations of their charming  order, for upon some threads of conferva were descried several elegant  crystal vases standing upon short foot-stalks, and containing little  creatures that jumped up and down like \"Jack in the box.\" These were so  minute, that a power of four hundred and thirty linear was  advantageously brought to bear upon them. When elongated their bodies  were somewhat pear-shaped, but more slender, and variegated with  vacuoles and particles of food. The mouths resembled those of  Vorticellae, and put forth circles of vibrating cilia. They were easily  alarmed, when the cilia were retracted, and down they sank to the bottom  of their vases, quickly to rise again. In one bottle there were two  living in friendly juxtaposition. This was not a case of matrimonial  felicity, nor of Siamese twins, but of _fission_, or reproduction by  division. The original inhabitant of the tube finding himself too fat,  or impelled by causes we do not understand, quietly divided himself in  two, and as the house was big enough, no enlargement was required. How  many stout puffy gentlemen must envy this process; how convenient to  have two thin lively specimens of humanity made out of one too obese for  locomotion. Man is, however, sometimes the victim of his superior  organization, and no process of \"fission\" can make the lusty lean.[9]    [9] Balbiani in his 'Recherches sur les Phenomenes Sexuels des  Infusoires,' speaks of the Vorticellids as the only Infusoria dividing  longitudinally. In other species such appearances arise from  conjunction.    The bottles in which these creatures live, in happy ignorance that they  are called by so crackjaw a name as _Cothurnia imberbis_, were described  as _Carapaces_ by Ehrenberg, but they bear no resemblance to the shell  of a turtle or crab. They are thrown off by the animals who preserve no  other connection with them than the attachment at the bottom.    The Micrographic Dictionary describes the family Ophrydina as  corresponding to Vorticellina with a carapace. Stein places them with  Vorticellids, &c., amongst his Peritricha, which are characterised by a  spiral wreath of cilia round the mouth.    Towards the end of the month a great number of black pear-shaped bodies  (Stentor niger), visible to the naked eye, were conspicuous in some  water from the Kentish Town ponds. Upon examination they were found to  be filled with granules that were red by reflected, and purple by  transmitted light. Each one had a spiral wreath of cilia, with a mouth  situated like those of the stentors, hereafter to be described, but none  of them became stationary, and in a few days they all disappeared. Stein  divides Ehrenberg's Stentor igneus from S. niger; the creature described  seems to have agreed with Stein's _igneus_, which he describes as having  blood-red lilac, cinnabar, or brown-red pigment particles, and as much  smaller than his S. niger. In the same water were specimens of that  singular Rotifer, the _Salpina_, about 1--150\" long, and furnished with  a _lorica_, or carapace, resembling a three-sided glass box, closed  below, and slightly open along the back. At the top of this box were  four, and at the bottom three, points or horns, and the creature had one  eye and a forked tail. Keeping him company was another little Rotifer,  named after its appearance, _Monocerca rattus_, the 'One-tailed Rat.'  This little animal had green matter in its stomach, which was in  constant commotion. I ought to have observed that the Salpina repeatedly  thrust out its gizzard, and used it as an external mouth. In the annexed  sketch the Salpina is seen in a position that displays the dorsal  opening of the carapace. Its three-cornered shape is only shown by a  side view.    [Illustration: Salpina redunca.]    Here we close a brief account of what March winds brought in their  train. The next chapter will show the good fortune that attended April  showers.          CHAPTER V.    APRIL.        The beautiful Floscule--Mode of seeking for Tubicolor          Rotifers--Mode of illuminating the Floscule--Difficulty of          seeing the transparent tube--Protrusion of long          hairs--Lobes--Gizzard--Hairy lobes of Floscule not rotatory          organs--Glass troughs--Their construction and use--Movement of          globules in lobes of Floscule--Chaetonotus larus--Its mode of          swimming--Coleps hirtus--Devourer of dead Entomostraca--Dead          Rotifer and Vibriones--Theories of fermentation and          putrefaction--Euplotes and Stylonichia--Fecundity of          Stylonichia.      Few living creatures deserve so well the appellation of \"beautiful\" as  the _Floscularia ornata_, or Beautiful Floscule, although to contemplate  a motionless and uncoloured portrait, one would imagine that it  exhibited no graces of either colour or form. Mr. Gosse has, however,  done it justice, and the drawing in his \"Tenby\" is executed with that  rare combination of scientific accuracy and artistic skill, for which  the productions of his pencil are renowned.    [Illustration: The Beautiful Floscule. A.--Partially protruded.  B.--Freely protruded, with three eggs. C.--Appearance of young.  D.--Floscule seventeen hours old. D'.--Jaws of Floscule, as figured by  Mr. Gosse.]    Probably the sketches in several works of authority representing the  long cilia as short bristles, are merely copies from old drawings, from  objects imperfectly seen under indifferent microscopes, and before  the refinements of illumination were understood. Be this as it may, any  reader will be fortunate if on an April, or any other morning, he or she  effects the capture of one of these exquisite objects, although the  first impression may not equal previous expectations, as the delicacy of  the organism is not disclosed by a mode of using the light which answers  well enough for the common infusoria.    When the Floscules, or other tubicolar Rotifers are specially sought  for, the best way is to proceed to a pond where slender-leaved  water-plants grow, and to examine a few branches at a time in a phial of  water with a pocket-lens. They are all large enough to be discerned, if  present, in this manner, and as soon as one is found, others may be  expected, either in the same or in adjacent parts of the pond, for they  are gregarious in their habits. With many, however, the first finding of  a Floscule will be an accident, as was the case last April, when a small  piece of myriophyllum was placed in the live-box, and looked over to see  what it might contain. The first glimpse revealed an egg-shaped object,  of a brownish tint, stretching itself upon a stalk, and showing some  symptoms of hairs or cilia at its head. This was enough to indicate the  nature of the creature, and to show the necessity for a careful  management of the light, which being adjusted obliquely, gave quite a  new character to the scene. The dirty brown hue disappeared, and was  replaced by brilliant colours; while the hairs, instead of appearing few  and short, were found to be extremely numerous, very long, and  glistening like delicate threads of spun glass.    Knowing that the Floscules live in transparent gelatinous tubes, such an  object was carefully looked for, but in this instance, as is not  uncommon, it was perfectly free from extraneous matter, and possessed  nearly the same refractive power as the water, so that displaying it to  advantage required some little trouble in the way of careful focusing,  and many experiments as to the best angle at which the mirror should be  turned to direct the light. When all was accomplished, it was seen that  the Floscule had her abode in a clear transparent cylinder, like a thin  confectioner's jar, which she did not touch except at the bottom, to  which her foot was attached. Lying aside her in the bottle were three  large eggs, and the slightest shock given to the table, induced her to  draw back in evident alarm. Immediately afterwards she slowly protruded  a dense bunch of the fine long hairs, which quivered in the light, and  shone with a delicate bluish-green lustre, here and there varied by  opaline tints.    The hairs were thrust out in a mass, somewhat after the mode in which  the old-fashioned telescope hearth-brooms were made to put forth their  bristles. As soon as they were completely everted, together with the  upper portion of the Floscule, six lobes gradually separated, causing  the hairs to fall on all sides in a graceful shower, and when the  process was complete, they remained"]]]
