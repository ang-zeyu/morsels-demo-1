[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#9)"],[1," is curiously important.  Dr. Brinkley cannot use goats from Colorado for that reason. If the  doctor's reception in England is cordial he will probably make his visit  there an annual summer affair of three months' duration for some years  to come, which would give him an opportunity of keeping in continued  touch with his English and European patients. The English are a  practical people, and less sensitive than we to, or more careless of,  ridicule, and they are likely to grasp the importance of Dr. Brinkley's  work on the instant of his arrival, compelling a long visit.          CHAPTER VII    PROFESSOR STEINACH AND THE RAT      Writing with vivacity and humor, Mr. Clarence Day, Jr., speculates with  so much whimsicality upon the possible effects of surgical rejuvenation  of men that one might overlook the keenness of his observation in a  hurried perusal of his article. For the sake of preserving it for more  leisurely study, and because the points raised are really worthy of  attention, the article is reproduced here in full, with acknowledgments  to +The Literary Review+, in which it first appeared, of date November  20, 1920. Says Mr. Day:    Biologists really seem to be discovering ways of making men young again.  So far, it is like making men drunk; the state that is produced does not  last. But it looks as though they might succeed in adding a chapter to  life. I wish it could be added to the other end: to youth instead of to  the last flickers. But if we can renew and re-live middle-age, that will  be better still.    A man named Steinach, in Vienna, has been experimenting for ten years  with rats. Full accounts of his work were published last summer in the  great biological journal founded by Roux, and these were summarized and  discussed by the London +Athenaeum+, which is now the most interesting  of all English weeklies. It is from the +Athenaeum's+ account that I am  taking these facts.    Steinach has been studying the interstitial cells that fill in the  spaces between the tubules of the testes, in males, and between the  follicles of the ovaries in females. His reason for choosing these cells  for his experiments is that they are a well-spring of life. Furthermore,  since all our vital functions are interrelated, to make these cells  active gives the whole organism new life and strength. This is not the  only way of stimulating the organism, but it seems the most powerful.    An old rat is like a senile old man; he is bald and emaciated, his eyes  are clouded, his breathing is labored. He stays in one place, with bent  back, and has small interest in anything. If you cut one of his genital  ducts, however, which is a comparatively slight operation, it has the  effect of making the interstitial cells multiply actively. Waves of life  flood his being. Within a few weeks he is transformed. These currents  restore and rebuild him; skin, muscle and mind. Both in looks and  behavior he is indistinguishable from other strong rats.    He has cast off old age. Senility, which sets in with men when they are  from sixty to eighty years old, begins after twenty to thirty months in  a rat. He is then about through. But when an operation is performed on a  senile rat he gets from six to eight months' new life. In other words,  the addition to his normal span is 20 to 30 per cent. That would be a  large fraction of life for a man to live over again. The rat lives it  vigorously, eagerly, back in his prime.    When senility again comes upon him it is in a modified form. His  organism as a whole is in better shape. It is his mind now that tires.  As Steinach has already cut one or both of his genital ducts, that  method of stimulating his cells cannot, of course, be repeated. But  another operation is ready. Some unfortunate young male is deprived of  his testes by Steinach, and these are implanted forthwith in this hoary  old rat.    A second spell of active life follows, not so long as the first. It ends  in acute psychic senility. The rat goes all to pieces. It is as if the  brain, twice restimulated to emotion, curiosity, keenness, had  approached the very limit of its running, and was completely exhausted.    Steinach has not yet tried whether a third rejuvenation is possible.  That remains to be seen. He lives in Vienna, and everything there has  come to a stop. He has no assistants, no funds, with which to conduct  further experiments. \"May happier lands or cities carry the work on,\" he  writes at the end.    It seems as though some rich American ought to stake the old boy.       *   *   *   *    Steinach has naturally found it more difficult to give new youth to  females. But here, too, he has in a measure succeeded. X-ray treatment  and ovarian transplantation are the methods employed.    As to human experiments, there is a colleague of Steinach's named  Lichtenstern, who has operated on numerous men and women with apparent  success. There has not been time yet to measure how long their new lease  of life is to be; but they have regained the joy of life they had  lost--strength and powers of work. Still, all this needs confirming.    In a rat it is the sexual impulses that are directly reanimated. He  again knows the fevers of courtship, the conflicts of marriage; and  whether he is glad to repeat these commotions depends on the rat. In  man, however, the sexual impulses are more or less sublimated, so that  the new energy may appear in any of the other forms of psychic activity.  Whatever such faculties he has in him once more grow strong.       *   *   *   *    How wonderful it would be if we could at least prolong certain  lives--great writers like H. G. Wells and Conrad, great artists, great  doctors. But in practice, the men who would get hold of this would be  John D. Rockefeller and W. J. Bryan. The rich uncle would walk in and  tell his hopeless heirs he had been to see Steinach. Senators would live  forever. The world would grow harder for youth.    Even were we able to control all this, and reserve the boon for the  best, would it work? Say we did choose the right men--is it not too  intimate a suggestion that we should set a man of science upon them,  prepared with a little knife to slice one of their genital ducts? Men  have fought all these years for the right to live. Have they no right to  die? Must an old man who is needed by the public be condemned to live  on, his aged cells stirred and restirred while we glean his brains bare?  Some Socrates of the future may yet envy that other his hemlock.       *   *   *   *    This, we say it regretfully, is the end of Mr. Day's article. It is  admirable fooling. We will not pay his wit the poor compliment of taking  him seriously at the last and pointing out to him that it was Heine who  said, \"Nobody loves life like an old man!\" There will be no need of  insistence to urge the old men, useful or useless, to submit to an  operation to renew their youth. But it is to be hoped that they will  never be asked to submit to the cutting of the genital duct. It seems to  the writer that +The Athenaeum+ must have misconstrued Dr. Steinach's  experiments in some degree, inasmuch as it is difficult to conceive of  the operation of severing a genital duct as conducive to cell-formation.  However, probably ligating is meant instead of severing. But this is not  the point really brought out by Mr. Day's clever article. The real point  is, Is it likely that if Mr. John Jones takes Dr. Brinkley's goat-gland  operation for the renewal of his youth, and thereby adds thirty years to  his life, and at the end of this thirty years of friskiness undergoes a  second transplantation of glands, thereby gaining twenty years more, and  at the end of this twenty years takes the operation a third time,  securing a further lease of gaiety for ten years, will the final years  of Mr. John Jones be years of acute psychic senility, as observed by Dr.  Steinach in his rat? To the writer it seems a +non sequitur+. The cases  are not parallel. The rejuvenated rat appears to regard his acquired  vitality as impelling toward revelry and excess. It is necessary to  emphasize the point that the pith and marrow of Dr. Brinkley's discovery  is that since it is clearly shown that rejuvenation is accomplished by  the restoration of activity to the sex-glands, therefore the  preservation of this rejuvenation MUST depend upon the CONSERVATION of  the seminal fluids, and cannot depend upon any other single factor  whatever. It has been already explained that Dr. Brinkley puts it out of  the power of the rejuvenated man to destroy the good that has come into  his life, and protects him against the danger of yielding too freely to  passionate impulse, by preventing the escape of the rejuvenating agent.  The means of nourishing the body and brain being therefore insured as to  supply, it is not reasonable to suppose that the nerve-cells of the  rejuvenated man can fail to receive their proper nourishment for many  succeeding years, and, passing by the rat as a fallacious parallel, we  cannot see any good reason why the human body and brain, either under  the guidance of self-control, or surgically safeguarded against the  waste of excess, should not function at their best for fifty years of  added life, with very possibly another fifty added to that. The real  crux of the matter is the resistive quality of tissue, which is  approximately 200 years for such organs as kidneys and heart, and, say,  150 for nerve-substance.    [Illustration: THE OPERATING ROOM AT THE BRINKLEY HOSPITAL]          CHAPTER VIII    A WEEK AT DR. BRINKLEY'S HOSPITAL      The writer, approaching the age of 54, and finding himself in  first-class physical and mental condition, except for a high blood  pressure, which was certainly the prelude to a later arterio-sclerosis,  decided that he would be doing himself a service, and put himself in a  better position to write with some authority upon the effects of the  goat-g"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#9)"],[1,"--Two Types of Drop Inlet Culvert]    =Reinforced Concrete Box Culverts.=--The pipe culvert is limited in  application to the smaller waterways. Reinforced concrete is  extensively used for culverts of all sizes, but especially for the  larger ones. These are usually constructed with endwalls integral with  the barrel of the culvert. Culverts of this type must be designed for  the loads anticipated to insure suitable strength and stability, and  must be constructed of a good quality of concrete. Figs. 2 and 3 show  designs for pipe and box culverts.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Drop Inlet Culvert]    =Drop Inlet Culverts.=--In some locations erosion has begun in the  fields adjacent to a culvert and it will probably continue until the  stream above the culvert has eroded to about the level of the floor of  the culvert. This is a reason for placing the culvert as high as the  roadway will permit, so long as the area above the culvert will be  properly drained. Considerable reclamation of land is possible if the  culvert is constructed with a box at the inlet and as shown in Fig. 4.  The area up-stream from the culvert will not erode below the level of  the top of the box at the inlet end.    Where the stream crossing the road has eroded to considerable depth or  has considerable fall, as would sometimes be the case on side hill  roads, the culvert barrel would follow the general slope of the ditch  but should have a drop inlet. This type of culvert is shown in Fig.  5.          CHAPTER IV    ROAD DESIGN      =Necessity for Planning.=--Sometimes highway improvement is the result  of spasmodic and carelessly directed work carried out at odd times on  various sections of a road, finally resulting in the worst places  being at least temporarily bettered. The grade on the steepest hills  is probably reduced somewhat and some of the worst of the low lying  sections are filled in and thereby raised. Short sections of surfacing  such as gravel or broken stone may be placed here and there. From the  standpoint of the responsible official, the road has been \"improved,\"  but too often such work does not produce an improvement that lasts,  and sometimes it is not even of any great immediate benefit to those  who use the roads. In nearly every instance such work costs more in  money and labor that it is worth.    Lasting improvement of public highways can be brought about only  through systematic and correlated construction carried on for a series  of years. In other words, there must be a road improvement policy  which will be made effective through some agency that is so organized  that its policies will be perpetuated and is clothed with enough  authority to be capable of enforcing the essential features of good  design and of securing the proper construction of improvements.    Details of highway construction and design must vary with many local  conditions and types of surface. The limits of grades and the many  other details of design may properly be adopted for a specific piece  of work only after an adequate investigation of the local requirements  and in the light of wide experience in supervising road improvement.    New ideas are constantly being injected into the art of road building,  but these are disseminated somewhat slowly, so that valuable devices  and improvements in methods remain long unknown except to the  comparatively few who have the means for informing themselves of all  such developments.    It follows then that the logical system of conducting road improvement  is through an agency of continuing personnel which will supervise the  preparation of suitable plans and direct the construction in  accordance with the most recent experience.    =Road Plans.=--The information shown on the plans prepared for road  improvement varies somewhat with the design and with the ideas of the  engineer as to what constitutes necessary information, but in general  the plans show the existing road and the new construction contemplated  in an amount of detail depending principally upon the character of the  construction. Simple plans suffice for grade reduction or reshaping an  earth road surface, while for the construction of paved roads, the  plans must be worked out in considerable detail. The essential  requirement is that there be given on the plans all information  necessary to enable the construction to be carried out according to  the intentions of the engineer, that all parts of the work fit  together, that the culverts are of the proper size and located at the  proper places, ditches drain properly, grades are reduced to the  predetermined rate, that excavated material is utilized and that an  exact record of the work done is retained. Plans are indispensable to  economical road construction and the preparation of the plans is the  work of the expert in road design, that is, the highway engineer.    =Problem of Design.=--The problem of road design is to prepare plans  for a road improvement with the various details so correlated as to  insure in the road constructed in accordance therewith the maximum of  safety, convenience and economy to the users thereof. The degree to  which the design will be effective will depend to a considerable  extent upon the financial limitations imposed upon the engineer, but  skill and effort on the plans will do a great deal to offset financial  handicap and no pains should be spared in the preparation of the  plans. Moreover, the plans must afford all of the information needed  by the contractor in preparing a bid for the work.    =Preliminary Investigation.=--The first step in road improvement is to  secure an adequate idea of the existing conditions on the road or  roads involved. The detail to which this information need go will  depend entirely upon the purpose of the preliminary investigation, for  before a definite plan is prepared, it may be necessary to choose the  best from among several available routes. For this purpose, it is not  always necessary to make an actual instrument survey of the several  routes. A hasty reconnaissance will usually be sufficient. This is  made by walking or riding over the road and noting, in a suitable book  or upon prepared blanks, the information needed. The items of  information recorded will usually be as follows: distances, grades,  type of soil on the road and nature of existing surface, character of  drainage, location of bridges and culverts and the type of each with  notes as to its condition, location of railway crossings and notes as  to type, location of intersecting roads, farm entrances, and all  similar features that have a bearing on the choice of routes. These  data can be obtained in a comparatively short time by a skilled  observer who may drive over the road in a motor car. Sometimes it may  be desirable to make a more careful study of some certain sections of  road and this may be done by waking over the section in question in  order to make a more deliberate survey of the features to be  considered than is possible when riding in a motor car.    Factors other than relative lengths of routes will obviously determine  the cost of improvement and the comparative merits of the improved  roads. Some special characteristic of a road, such as bad railroad  crossings or a few bad hills, may eliminate a route, or availability  of materials along a route may offset disadvantages of alignment or  grade.    In special cases, complete surveys of routes may be required finally  to select the best route, but these instances are few in number.    =Road Surveys.=--When a road has been definitely selected for  improvement, a careful survey is made to furnish information for the  preparation of the plans. This will consist of a transit survey and a  level survey.    The transit survey is made by running a line between established  corners following the recorded route of the road, or if no records are  available or the road is irregular in alignment, by establishing  arbitrary reference points and running a line along the center line of  the existing road or parallel thereto. The topography is referenced to  this line in such completeness that it can be reproduced on the plans.  The level survey consists in taking levels on cross sections of the  road at one hundred foot intervals, and oftener if there are abrupt  changes in grade. Special level determinations are made at streams,  railroad crossings, intersecting roads or lanes and wherever it  appears some special features of the terrain should be recorded.    From the surveys and such other information as has been assembled  relative to the project, a plan is prepared which embodies a design  presumed to provide for an improvement in accordance with the best  highway practice.      THE PROBLEM OF DESIGN    It will be convenient to consider separately the components of a road  design, although in the actual design the consideration of these  cannot be separated because all parts of the plan must fit together.    =Alignment.=--The alignment of the road is determined to a  considerable extent by the existing right-of-way, which may follow  section lines, regardless of topography, as is the case with many  roads in the prairie states, or it may follow the valleys, ridges, or  other favorable location in hilly country. In many places the roads of  necessity wind around among the hills in order to avoid excessive  grades. In designing an improvement, it is generally desirable to  follow the existing right-of-way so far as possible. But the element  of safety must not be lost sight of, and curves should not preclude a  view ahead for sufficient distance to insure safety to vehicles. The  necessary length of clear view ahead is usually assumed to be 250  feet, but probably 200 feet is a satisfactory compromise distance when  a greater distance cannot be obtained at reasonable cost. To secure  suitable sight distance, the curves must be of long radii, and where  possible the right-of-way on "]]]
