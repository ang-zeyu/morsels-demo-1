The ground plan is composed, like that of  Torcello, of nave and aisles only, but the clerestory has transepts  extending as far as the outer wall of the aisles. The semicircular apse,  thrown out in the centre of the east end, is now the chief feature of  interest in the church, though the nave shafts and the eastern  extremities of the aisles, outside, are also portions of the original  building; the latter having been modernized in the interior, it cannot  now be ascertained whether, as is probable, the aisles had once round  ends as well as the choir. The spaces F G form small chapels, of which G  has a straight terminal wall behind its altar, and F a curved one,  marked by the dotted line; the partitions which divide these chapels  from the presbytery are also indicated by dotted lines, being modern  work.    Sec. XIV. The plan is drawn carefully to scale, but the relation in which  its proportions are disposed can hardly be appreciated by the eye. The  width of the nave from shaft to opposite shaft is 32 feet 8 inches: of  the aisles, from the shaft to the wall, 16 feet 2 inches, or allowing 2  inches for the thickness of the modern wainscot, 16 feet 4 inches, half  the breadth of the nave exactly. The intervals between the shafts are  exactly one fourth of the width of the nave, or 8 feet 2 inches, and the  distance between the great piers which form the pseudo-transept is 24  feet 6 inches, exactly three times the interval of the shafts. So the  four distances are accurately in arithmetical proportion; i.e.                                      Ft. In.    Interval of shafts               8   2    Width of aisle                  16   4    Width of transept               24   6    Width of nave                   32   8    The shafts average 5 feet 4 inches in circumference, as near the base as  they can be got at, being covered with wood; and the broadest sides of  the main piers are 4 feet 7 inches wide, their narrowest sides 3 feet 6  inches. The distance _a c_ from the outmost angle of these piers to the  beginning of the curve of the apse is 25 feet, and from that point the  apse is nearly semicircular, but it is so encumbered with renaissance  fittings that its form cannot be ascertained with perfect accuracy. It  is roofed by a concha, or semi-dome; and the external arrangement of its  walls provides for the security of this dome by what is, in fact, a  system of buttresses as effective and definite as that of any of the  northern churches, although the buttresses are obtained entirely by  adaptations of the Roman shaft and arch, the lower story being formed by  a thick mass of wall lightened by ordinary semicircular round-headed  niches, like those used so extensively afterwards in renaissance  architecture, each niche flanked by a pair of shafts standing clear of  the wall, and bearing deeply moulded arches thrown over the niche. The  wall with its pillars thus forms a series of massy buttresses (as seen  in the ground plan), on the top of which is an open gallery, backed by a  thinner wall, and roofed by arches whose shafts are set above the pairs  of shafts below. On the heads of these arches rests the roof. We have,  therefore, externally a heptagonal apse, chiefly of rough and common  brick, only with marble shafts and a few marble ornaments; but for that  very reason all the more interesting, because it shows us what may be  done, and what was done, with materials such as are now at our own  command; and because in its proportions, and in the use of the few  ornaments it possesses, it displays a delicacy of feeling rendered  doubly notable by the roughness of the work in which laws so subtle are  observed, and with which so thoughtful ornamentation is associated.    Sec. XV. First, for its proportions: I shall have occasion in Chapter V.  to dwell at some length on the peculiar subtlety of the early Venetian  perception for ratios of magnitude; the relations of the sides of this  heptagonal apse supply one of the first and most curious instances of  it. The proportions above given of the nave and aisles might have been  dictated by a mere love of mathematical precision; but those of the apse  could only have resulted from a true love of harmony.    In fig. 6, Plate I. the plan of this part of the church is given on a  large scale, showing that its seven external sides are arranged on a  line less than a semicircle, so that if the figure were completed, it  would have sixteen sides; and it will be observed also, that the seven  sides are arranged in four magnitudes, the widest being the central one.  The brickwork is so much worn away, that the measures of the arches are  not easily ascertainable, but those of the plinth on which they stand,  which is nearly uninjured, may be obtained accurately. This plinth is  indicated by the open line in the ground plan, and its sides measure  respectively:                                      Ft.  In.    1st. _a b_ in plan               6    7    2nd. _b c_                       7    7    3rd. _c d_                       7    5    4th. _d e_ (central)             7   10    5th. _e f_                       7    5    6th  _f g_                       7    8    7th. _g h_                       6   10    Sec. XVI. Now observe what subtle feeling is indicated by this delicacy  of proportion. How fine must the perceptions of grace have been in those  builders who could not be content without _some_ change between the  second and third, the fifth and sixth terms of proportion, such as  should oppose the general direction of its cadence, and yet _were_  content with a diminution of two inches on a breadth of seven feet and a  half! For I do not suppose that the reader will think the curious  lessening of the third and fifth arch a matter of accident, and even if  he did so, I shall be able to prove to him hereafter that it was not,  but that the early builders were always desirous of obtaining some  alternate proportion of this kind. The relations of the numbers are not  easily comprehended in the form of feet and inches, but if we reduce the  first four of them into inches, and then subtract some constant number,  suppose 75, from them all, the remainders 4, 16, 14, 19, will exhibit  the ratio of proportion in a clearer, though exaggerated form.    Sec. XVII. The pairs of circular spots at _b_, _c_, _d_, etc., on the  ground plan fig. 6, represent the bearing shafts, which are all of solid  marble as well as their capitals. Their measures and various other  particulars respecting them are given in Appendix 6. \"Apse of Murano;\"  here I only wish the reader to note the coloring of their capitals.  Those of the two single shafts in the angles (_a_, _h_) are both of deep  purple marble; the two next pairs, _b_ and _g_, are of white marble; the  pairs _c_ and _f_ are of purple, and _d_ and _e_ are of white: thus  alternating with each other on each side; two white meeting in the  centre. Now observe, _the purple capitals are all left plain; the white  are all sculptured_. For the old builders knew that by carving the  purple capitals they would have injured them in two ways: first, they  would have mixed a certain quantity of grey shadow with the surface hue,  and so adulterated the purity of the color; secondly, they would have  drawn away the thoughts from the color, and prevented the mind from  fixing upon it or enjoying it, by the degree of attention which the  sculpture would have required. So they left their purple capitals full  broad masses of color; and sculptured the white ones, which would  otherwise have been devoid of interest.    Sec. XVIII. But the feature which is most to be noted in this apse is a  band of ornament, which runs round it like a silver girdle, composed of  sharp wedges of marble, preciously inlaid, and set like jewels into the  brickwork; above it there is another band of triangular recesses in the  bricks, of nearly similar shape, and it seems equally strange that all  the marbles should have fallen from it, or that it should have been  originally destitute of them. The reader may choose his hypothesis; but  there is quite enough left to interest us in the lower band, which is  fortunately left in its original state, as is sufficiently proved by the  curious niceties in the arrangement of its colors, which are assuredly  to be attributed to the care of the first builder. A word or two, in the  first place, respecting the means of color at his disposal.    Sec. XIX. I stated that the building was, for the most part, composed of  yellow brick. This yellow is very nearly pure, much more positive and  somewhat darker than that of our English light brick, and the material  of the brick is very good and hard, looking, in places, almost  vitrified, and so compact as to resemble stone. Together with this brick  occurs another of a deep full red, and more porous substance, which is  used for decoration chiefly, while all the parts requiring strength are  composed of the yellow brick. Both these materials are _cast into any  shape and size_ the builder required, either into curved pieces for the  arches, or flat tiles for filling the triangles; and, what is still more  curious, the thickness of the yellow bricks used for the walls varies  considerably, from two inches to four; and their length also, some of  the larger pieces used in important positions being a foot and a half  long.    With these two kinds of brick, the builder employed five or six kinds of  marble: pure white, and white veined with purple; a brecciated marble of  white and black; a brecciated marble of white and deep green; another,  deep red, or nearly of the color of Egyptian porphyry; and a grey and  black marble, in fine layers.    Sec. XX. The method of employing these materials will be understood at  once by a reference to the opposite plate (Plate III.), which represents  two portions of the lower band. I could not succeed in expressing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#9)"],[1,"drawing and accurate light and shade in painting, and  true anatomy in all representations of the human form, drawn or  sculptured, are the first requirements in all the work of this school.    Sec. VII. Now, first considering all this in the most charitable light,  as pursued from a real love of truth, and not from vanity, it would, of  course, have been all excellent and admirable, had it been regarded as  the aid of art, and not as its essence. But the grand mistake of the  Renaissance schools lay in supposing that science and art are the same  things, and that to advance in the one was necessarily to perfect the  other. Whereas they are, in reality, things not only different, but so  opposed, that to advance in the one is, in ninety-nine cases out of the  hundred, to retrograde in the other. This is the point to which I would  at present especially bespeak the reader's attention.    Sec. VIII. Science and art are commonly distinguished by the nature of  their actions; the one as knowing, the other as changing, producing, or  creating. But there is a still more important distinction in the nature  of the things they deal with. Science deals exclusively with things as  they are in themselves; and art exclusively with things as they affect  the human senses and human soul.[8] Her work is to portray the  appearance of things, and to deepen the natural impressions which they  produce upon living creatures. The work of science is to substitute  facts for appearances, and demonstrations for impressions. Both,  observe, are equally concerned with truth; the one with truth of aspect,  the other with truth of essence. Art does not represent things falsely,  but truly as they appear to mankind. Science studies the relations of  things to each other: but art studies only their relations to man; and  it requires of everything which is submitted to it imperatively this,  and only this,--what that thing is to the human eyes and human heart,  what it has to say to men, and what it can become to them: a field of  question just as much vaster than that of science, as the soul is larger  than the material creation.    Sec. IX. Take a single instance. Science informs us that the sun is  ninety-five millions of miles distant from, and 111 times broader than,  the earth; that we and all the planets revolve round it; and that it  revolves on its own axis in 25 days, 14 hours and 4 minutes. With all  this, art has nothing whatsoever to do. It has no care to know anything  of this kind. But the things which it does care to know, are these: that  in the heavens God hath set a tabernacle for the sun, \"which is as a  bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to  run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his  circuit unto the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat  thereof.\"    Sec. X. This, then, being the kind of truth with which art is exclusively  concerned, how is such truth as this to be ascertained and accumulated?  Evidently, and only, by perception and feeling. Never either by  reasoning, or report. Nothing must come between Nature and the artist's  sight; nothing between God and the artist's soul. Neither calculation  nor hearsay,--be it the most subtle of calculations, or the wisest of  sayings,--may be allowed to come between the universe, and the witness  which art bears to its visible nature. The whole value of that witness  depends on its being _eye_-witness; the whole genuineness,  acceptableness, and dominion of it depend on the personal assurance of  the man who utters it. All its victory depends on the veracity of the  one preceding word, \"Vidi.\"    The whole function of the artist in the world is to be a seeing and  feeling creature; to be an instrument of such tenderness and  sensitiveness, that no shadow, no hue, no line, no instantaneous and  evanescent expression of the visible things around him, nor any of the  emotions which they are capable of conveying to the spirit which has  been given him, shall either be left unrecorded, or fade from the book  of record. It is not his business either to think, to judge, to argue,  or to know. His place is neither in the closet, nor on the bench, nor at  the bar, nor in the library. They are for other men and other work. He  may think, in a by-way; reason, now and then, when he has nothing better  to do; know, such fragments of knowledge as he can gather without  stooping, or reach without pains; but none of these things are to be his  care. The work of his life is to be twofold only: to see, to feel.    Sec. XI. Nay, but, the reader perhaps pleads with me, one of the great  uses of knowledge is to open the eyes; to make things perceivable which,  never would have been seen, unless first they had been known.    Not so. This could only be said or believed by those who do not know  what the perceptive faculty of a great artist is, in comparison with  that of other men. There is no great painter, no great workman in any  art, but he sees more with the glance of a moment than he could learn by  the labor of a thousand hours. God has made every man fit for his work;  He has given to the man whom he means for a student, the reflective,  logical, sequential faculties; and to the man whom He means for an  artist, the perceptive, sensitive, retentive faculties. And neither of  these men, so far from being able to do the other's work, can even  comprehend the way in which it is done. The student has no understanding  of the vision, nor the painter of the process; but chiefly the student  has no idea of the colossal grasp of the true painter's vision and  sensibility.    The labor of the whole Geological Society, for the last fifty years, has  but now arrived at the ascertainment of those truths respecting mountain  form which Turner saw and expressed with a few strokes of a camel's hair  pencil fifty years ago, when he was a boy. The knowledge of all the laws  of the planetary system, and of all the curves of the motion of  projectiles, would never enable the man of science to draw a waterfall  or a wave; and all the members of Surgeons' Hall helping each other  could not at this moment see, or represent, the natural movement of a  human body in vigorous action, as a poor dyer's son did two hundred  years ago.[9]    Sec. XII. But surely, it is still insisted, granting this peculiar faculty  to the painter, he will still see more as he knows more, and the more  knowledge he obtains, therefore, the better. No; not even so. It is  indeed true, that, here and there, a piece of knowledge will enable the  eye to detect a truth which might otherwise have escaped it; as, for  instance, in watching a sunrise, the knowledge of the true nature of the  orb may lead the painter to feel more profoundly, and express more  fully, the distance between the bars of cloud that cross it, and the  sphere of flame that lifts itself slowly beyond them into the infinite  heaven. But, for one visible truth to which knowledge thus opens the  eyes, it seals them to a thousand: that is to say, if the knowledge  occur to the mind so as to occupy its powers of contemplation at the  moment when the sight work is to be done, the mind retires inward, fixes  itself upon the known fact, and forgets the passing visible ones; and a  _moment_ of such forgetfulness loses more to the painter than a day's  thought can gain. This is no new or strange assertion. Every person  accustomed to careful reflection of any kind, knows that its natural  operation is to close his eyes to the external world. While he is  thinking deeply, he neither sees nor feels, even though naturally he may  possess strong powers of sight and emotion. He who, having journeyed all  day beside the Leman Lake, asked of his companions, at evening, where it  was,[10] probably was not wanting in sensibility; but he was generally a  thinker, not a perceiver. And this instance is only an extreme one of  the effect which, in all cases, knowledge, becoming a subject of  reflection, produces upon the sensitive faculties. It must be but poor  and lifeless knowledge, if it has no tendency to force itself forward,  and become ground for reflection, in despite of the succession of  external objects. It will not obey their succession. The first that  comes gives it food enough for its day's work; it is its habit, its  duty, to cast the rest aside, and fasten upon that. The first thing that  a thinking and knowing man sees in the course of the day, he will not  easily quit. It is not his way to quit anything without getting to the  bottom of it, if possible. But the artist is bound to receive all things  on the broad, white, lucid field of his soul, not to grasp at one. For  instance, as the knowing and thinking man watches the sunrise, he sees  something in the color of a ray, or the change of a cloud, that is new  to him; and this he follows out forthwith into a labyrinth of optical  and pneumatical laws, perceiving no more clouds nor rays all the  morning. But the painter must catch all the rays, all the colors that  come, and see them all truly, all in their real relations and  succession; therefore, everything that occupies room in his mind he must  cast aside for the time, as completely as may be. The thoughtful man is  gone far away to seek; but the perceiving man must sit still, and open  his heart to receive. The thoughtful man is knitting and sharpening  himself into a two-edged sword, wherewith to pierce. The perceiving man  is stretching himself into a four-cornered sheet wherewith to catch. And  all the breadth to which he can expand himself, and all the white  emptiness into which he can blanch himself, will not be enough to  receive what God has to give him.    Sec. XIII. What, then, it will be indignantly asked, is an utterly  ignorant and unthinking man likely to make the best artist? No, not so  neither. Knowledge is good for him so long as he can keep it utterly,  servilely,"]]]
