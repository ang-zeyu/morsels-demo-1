This procedure would seem to  be different to the parental instinct which governs the feeding of the  young, and it seemed to show that the cock realized that the hen must be  thirsty and in need of the snow, and kept this fact in mind when he was  away from her. Another point to note is that the occurrence was a very  rare and, in fact, exceptional one.    When conditions arose which were new to their experience the penguins  seemed utterly unable to grasp them.    As an example of this, we had rigged a guide rope from our hut to the  meteorological screen, about fifty yards away, to guide us during  blizzards. This rope, which was supported by poles driven into the  ground, sagged in one place till it nearly touched the ground. At  frequent intervals, penguins on their way past the hut were brought to a  standstill by running their breasts into this sagged rope, and each bird  as it was caught invariably went through the same ridiculous procedure.  First it would push hard against the rope, then finding this of no  avail, back a few steps, walk up to it again and have another push,  repeating the process several times. After this, instead of going a few  feet further along where it could easily walk under the rope, in ninety  per cent. of cases it would turn, and by a wide detour walk right round  the hut the other way, evidently convinced that some unknown obstacle  completely barred its passage on that side. This spectacle was a  continual source of amusement to us as it went on all day and every day  for some time.      [Illustration: Fig. 37. A Nest on a Rock (See page 71)]      [Illustration: Fig. 38. \"One after another, the rest of the Party    followed him\" (Page 75)]    As penguins' eggs are very good to eat and a great luxury, as well as  being beneficial to men living under Antarctic conditions, we collected  a large number, which we stowed away to freeze. To collect these eggs we  used to set off, carrying a bucket, and walk through the knolls. As we  picked our way, carefully placing our feet in the narrow spaces between  the nests, we were savagely pecked about the legs, as in most positions  at least, these birds could reach us without even leaving the nest,  whilst very often the mates standing near them would sail in at us,  raining in blows with their flippers with the rapidity of a maxim gun.    To search for eggs it was necessary to lift up the occupant of each nest  and look beneath her. If she were tackled from front or flank this was a  painful and difficult business, as she drove at the intruder's hands  with powerful strokes of her sharp beak, but we found that the best way  to set about the matter was to dangle a fur mit in front of her with one  hand, and when she seized this quickly slip the other behind her,  lifting her nether regions from the nest, and at the same time pushing  her gently forward. Immediately she would drop the fur mit, and sticking  her beak into the ground push herself backward with a determined effort  to stay on the nest. So long as the pressure from behind was kept up she  would keep her beak firmly fixed in the ground, and could be robbed at  will.    The egg abstracted, she was then left in peace, on which she would rise  to her feet, look under her for the egg and, finding that it was gone,  ruffle her feathers, and, trembling with indignation, look round for the  robber, seemingly quite unable to realize that we were the guilty ones.  This is typical of the Adelie's attitude towards us. We are beyond their  comprehension, and fear of us, anger at us, curiosity over us, although  frequently shown, are displayed only for a fleeting moment. In a few  minutes she might forget about the incident altogether and quietly  resume her position on the empty nest, but very often she would  violently attack any other bird who might happen to be standing near,  and thus as we filled our buckets we left a line of altercation in our  wake. This, however, was not long lived, and affairs soon settled down  to their normal state, and I believe that in about one minute the affair  was completely forgotten. The penguin, indeed, is in its nature the  embodiment of all that man should be when he explores the Antarctic  regions, ever acting on the principle that it is of no use to worry over  spilt milk.      [Illustration: Fig. 39. A JOY RIDE (Page 77)]    The comparative size of the penguin's egg is shown in some of my  photographs. Ninety-six eggs averaged 4.56 ounces apiece. They vary in  size from about 6.45 cm. to 7.2 cm. in length, and from 5.0 cm. to  5.5 cm. in breadth, on an average. Both ends are nearly equally rounded,  and of a white chalky texture without, and green within. This green  colour is plainly shown by transmitted light.    When the two have been laid the sitting bird places them one in front of  the other. The rearmost egg is tucked up on the outspread feet, the  foremost lies on the ground, and is covered by the belly of the bird as  it lies forward upon it. (Fig. 31.) By many of the birds a strong  inclination to burrow was displayed, and they seemed very fond of  delving in the soft shingle ledges that were to be found on some parts  of the beach. They did this ostensibly to get small stones for their  nests, but certainly burrowed deeper than they need have done, and  occasionally squatted for some time in little caves that they made in  this way. I noticed the same thing in the drifts when they went to eat  snow, and thought at times that they were going to make underground  nests, but they never did so, though some of the little shingle caves  would have made ideal nesting sites.    By November 7, though many nests were still without eggs, a large number  now contained two, and their owners started, turn and turn about, to go  to the open water leads about a third of a mile distant to feed, and as  a result of this a change began gradually to come over the face of the  rookery. Hitherto the whole ground in the neighbourhood of the nests had  been stained a bright green. This was due to the fasting birds  continually dropping their watery, bile-stained excreta upon it. (The  gall of penguins is bright green.) These excreta practically contained  no solid matter excepting epithelial cells and salts.    The nests themselves are never fouled, the excreta being squirted clear  of them for a distance of a foot or more, so that each nest has the  appearance of a flower with bright green petals radiating from its  centre. Some of the photographs show this well, especially Fig. 30. Even  when the chicks have come and are being sat upon by the parents, this  still holds good, because they lie with their heads under the old bird's  belly and their hindquarters just presenting themselves, so that they  may add their little decorative offerings, petal by petal! Now that the  birds were going to feed, the watery-green stains upon the ground gave  place to the characteristic bright brick-red guano, resulting from their  feeding on the shrimp-like euphausia in the sea; and the colour of the  whole rookery was changed in a few days, though this was first  noticeable, of course, in the region of those knolls which had been  occupied first, and which were now settled down to the peaceable and  regular family life which was to last until the chicks had grown.      [Illustration: Fig. 40. A KNOT OF PENGUINS ON THE ICE-FOOT (Page 77)]    As this family life became established, law and order reigned to some  extent, and there was a distinct tendency to preserve it, noticeably on  those knolls which had so settled down, and I think the following most  surprising incident bears evidence of what I have said. I quote word for  word from my notes on November 24, 1911:    \"This afternoon I saw two cocks (probably) engaged in a very fierce  fight, which lasted a good three minutes. They were fighting with  flippers and bills, one of them being particularly clever with the  latter, frequently seizing and holding his opponent just behind the  right eye whilst he battered him with his flippers.    \"After a couple of minutes, during which each had the other down on the  ground several times, three or four other penguins ran up and apparently  tried to stop the fight. This is the only construction I can put on  their behaviour, as time after time they kept running in when the two  combatants clinched, pushing their breasts in between them, but making  no attempt to fight themselves, whilst their more collected appearance  and smooth feathers were in marked contrast to the angry attitudes of  the combatants.    \"The fight, which had started on the outskirts of a knoll crowded with  nests, soon edged away to the space outside, and it was here that I (and  Campbell, who was with me) saw the other penguins try to stop it. The  last minute was a very fierce and vindictive 'mill,' both fighting with  all their might, and ended in one of them trying to toboggan away from  his opponent; but he was too exhausted to get any pace on, so that just  as he got into the crowd again he was caught, and both fought for a few  seconds more, when the apparent victor suddenly stopped and ran away.  The other picked himself up and made his way rapidly among the nests,  evidently searching for one in particular.    \"Following him, I saw him run up to a nest near the place where the  fight had begun. There was a solitary penguin waiting by this nest,  which was evidently new and not yet completed, and without eggs. The  cock I had followed, ruffled and battered with battle, ran up to the  waiting bird, and the usual side-to-side chatter in the ecstatic  attitude began and continued for half a minute, after which each became  calmer, and I left them apparently reconciled and arranging stones in  the nest.    \"This incident was after the usual nature of a dispute between two mates  for a hen, but the pacific interference of the other birds was quite new  to my experience. That it was pacific"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36924"],[0,"The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci, and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career (#9)"],[1," port where we found a village built over a lake, like  Venice. There were about forty-four large houses founded on very thick  piles, and each had a drawbridge leading to the door. From one house  there was a way to all the rest by drawbridges which led from house to  house. The people of this little city showed signs that they were afraid  of us, and suddenly they rose all at once. While looking at this wonder,  we saw about twenty-two canoes coming over the sea, which are the sort of  boats they use, hollowed out of a single tree. They came to our ships,  as if to gaze with wonder at us and our clothes, but they kept at a  distance. Things being so, we made signs to them to come to us, giving  them assurances of friendship. Seeing that they did not come we went to  them, but they did not wait for us. They went on shore, and made signs  to us that we should wait, and that they would soon return. They went  straight to a hill, and were not long before they came back, leading with  them sixteen of their young girls. They got into the canoes and came to  the ships, and in each ship they put four, and we were as much surprised  at such a proceeding as your Magnificence will be. They were amongst our  ships with the canoes, speaking with us. We looked upon this as a sign  of friendship. Presently a number of people came swimming over the sea,  and approached us without our feeling any suspicion whatever, having  come from the houses. Then certain old women appeared at the doors  of the houses, uttering great cries and tearing their hair in sign  of grief. This made us suspect something, and each man seized his  arms. Suddenly the young girls who were on board jumped into the sea,  and those in the canoes came nearer, and began to shoot with their bows  and arrows. Those who were swimming had each brought a lance, concealed  under the water as much as possible. As soon as we understood the  treachery we not only defended ourselves from them, but also attacked  them vigorously and sank many of their canoes with our ships. Thus we  routed and slaughtered them, and all took to swimming, abandoning their  canoes. Having thus suffered enough damage, they swam to the land. Nearly  fifteen or twenty of them were killed, and many were wounded. Of our  men five were wounded, and all escaped, thanks to God. We captured two  girls and two men. We went to their houses and entered them, but only  found two old women and one sick man. We took many of their things,  but they were of little value. We would not burn their houses, because  we felt compunctions of conscience. We returned to our ships with five  prisoners, and put irons on the feet of each, except the girls. On the  following night the two girls and one of the men escaped with great  cunning. Next day we decided upon continuing our course onwards.    We sailed constantly along the coast, and came to another tribe, distant  about 80 leagues from the one we had left, and very different both as  regards language and customs. We came to an anchor, and went on shore in  the boats, when we saw that a great number of people were on the beach,  upwards of 4,000 souls. They did not wait for our landing, but took  to flight, abandoning their things. We jumped on shore, and went along  a road which led to the woods. At the distance of a cross-bow shot we  found their huts, where they had made very large fires, and two were  there cooking their food, and roasting animals and fish of many sorts.  Here we saw that they were roasting a certain animal like a serpent,  except that it had no wings, and its appearance was so horrid that many  of us wondered at its fierceness. We walked to their houses or sheds,  and they had many of these serpents alive, fastened by their feet and  with a cord round the snout, so that they could not open their mouths, as  is done to pointers,[75] to prevent them from biting. Their aspect was so  fierce that none of us dared to go near one, thinking they were poisonous.  They are the size of a young goat, and a fathom and a half long. They  have long and thick feet, armed with large claws, the skin hard and of  various colours. The mouth and face are like those of a serpent. They  have a crest like a saw, which extends from the nose to the end of the  tail. We concluded that they were serpents and poisonous, yet they eat  them.[76] We found that the natives made bread of small fishes, which  they take from the sea, first boiling them, then pounding them into a  paste, and roasting them in the cinders, and so they are eaten. We tried  them, and found them good. They have so many other kinds of food, and a  greater number of fruits and roots, that it would take long to describe  them in detail. Seeing that the people did not come back, we determined  not to touch any of their things, to give them more confidence. We also  left many of our own things in their huts, that they might see them,  and at night we returned to the ships. Next day, at dawn, we saw an  immense crowd of people on the beach, so we went on shore. When they  again showed fear we reassured them, and induced them to treat with us,  giving them everything they asked for. When they became friendly they  told us that those were their habitations, and that they were come to  fish. They asked us to come to their villages that they might receive  us as friends. They showed such friendship because of the two men we  had prisoners, who were their enemies. Seeing their importunity, and  after a consultation, we decided that twenty-eight of our Christians,  in good order, should go with them, with the firm intention to die if  it should be necessary. When we had been there nearly three days we  went with them into the interior. At a distance of three leagues from  the beach we came to a village of few houses and many inhabitants,  there not being more than nine habitations. Here we were received with  so many barbarous ceremonies that the pen will not suffice to write  them down. There were songs, dances, tears mingled with rejoicings,  and plenty of food. We remained here for the night. Here they offered  their wives to us, and we were unable to defend ourselves from them. We  remained all night and half the next day. The multitude of people who came  to see us was such that they could not be counted. The older men prayed  that we would come with them to another village further in the interior,  making signs that they would show us the greatest honour. So we agreed  to go, and it cannot be expressed what great honour they showed us. We  came to many villages, and were nine days on the journey, so that our  Christians who remained on board became anxious about us. Being nearly  eighteen leagues inland in a direct line, we determined to return to the  ships. On the return journey the crowd was so great that came with us  to the beach, both of women and men, that it was wonderful. If any of  our people got tired on the way, they carried them in their nets very  comfortably. In crossing the rivers, which are numerous and very large,  they took us across by their contrivances so safely that there was no  danger whatever. Many of them came laden with the things they had given  to us, which were their sleeping-nets, most of them richly worked,  numerous parrots of various colours, many bows and arrows; while others  carried burdens consisting of their provisions and animals. What greater  wonder can I tell you than that they thought themselves fortunate when,  in passing a river, they could carry us on their backs?    Having reached the shore, we went on board the ships. They made such a  crowd to enter our ships in order to see them, that we were astonished.  We took as many as we could in the boats, and took them to the ships,  and so many came swimming that we were inclined to stop such a crowd  from being on board, more than a thousand souls, all naked and without  arms. They wondered at our arrangements and contrivances, and at the  size of the ships. There happened a laughable thing, which was that we  had occasion to fire off some of our artillery, and when the report  was heard, the greater part of the natives on board jumped overboard  from fear, and began to swim, like the frogs on the banks, which, when  they are frightened, jump into the swamp. Such was the conduct of these  people. Those who remained on board were so frightened that we were  sorry we had done it, but we reassured them by saying that we frightened  our enemies with those arms. Having amused themselves all day on board,  we told them that they must go, because we wished to depart that night;  and so they went away with much show of love and friendship, returning to  the shore. Among this tribe, and in their land, I knew and saw so much  of their customs and mode of life that I do not care to enlarge upon  them here; for your Magnificence must know that in each of my voyages  I have noted down the most remarkable things, and all is reduced into  a volume in the geographical style, entitled the FOUR VOYAGES, in which  work all things are described in detail, but I have not yet sent out a  copy, because it is necessary for me to revise it.    This land is very populous and full of people, with numerous rivers,  but few animals. They are similar to ours, except the lions, ounces,  stags, pigs, goats, and deer; and these still have some differences of  form. They have neither horses nor mules, asses nor dogs, nor any kind of  sheep, nor cattle. But they have many other animals all wild, and none  of them serve for any domestic use, so that they cannot be counted.  What shall we say of the birds, which are so many, and of so many kinds  and colours of plumage that it is wonderful to see them? The land is  very pleasant and fruitful, full of very large woods and forests, and  it is always green, for the trees never shed their leaves. The fruits  are so numerous that they cannot be enumerated, and all different from  ours. This land "]]]
