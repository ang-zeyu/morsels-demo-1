[Illustration: FIG. 18]    Either cut off the tube close to the bulb at _B_, or better, remove the  end by melting the glass and pulling it away from _B_, and then pierce  _A_ at _B_, No. 2, by heating the glass there and blowing out a small  bulb as described under Piercing.    Prepare a tube (4) drawn out at _E_ with a bulb blown at _D_. Insert _E_  into the opening _B_, press _D_ well against the mouth _B_ and slowly  rotate before the blow-pipe till _D_ adheres to _B_. Then heat and blow  the joint spot by spot as in other cases, taking care that the glass is  blown out on each side of the joint; lastly, heat the whole joint  between _aa_, and blow it into its final shape.    These joints are very apt to break after a few minutes or hours if the  glass of _D_ be much thicker than that of the bulb _A_. They should be  wrapped in cotton wool for annealing as soon as possible, as the rate at  which the tube _E_ cools is likely to be less rapid than that of the  parts of the apparatus which are more freely exposed to the air;  therefore all such internal joints require very careful annealing, and  they should always be made as thin as is consistent with the use to  which they are to be put.    Tubes may also be sealed into the ends or sides of larger tubes by  piercing them at the point at which the inserted tube is to be  introduced, and proceeding as in the case of the air-trap just  described.    Ozone generators of the form shown on next page (Fig. 19), afford an  interesting example of the insertion of smaller tubes into larger.    On account of the small space that may be left between the inner and  outer tubes of an ozone generator, and of the length of the inner tube,  its construction needs great care. I find the following mode of  procedure gives good results. Select the pieces of tube for this  instrument as free from curvature as possible. For the inner tube, a  tube 12 mm., or rather more, in external diameter, and of rather thin  glass, is drawn out, as for closing, until only a very narrow tube  remains at _C_, the end of _C_ is closed the area round _C_ is  carefully blown into shape, so that by melting off _C_ the tube _A_ will  be left with a well-rounded end. A small bulb of glass is next blown on  _A_ at _B_. This bulb must be of slightly greater diameter than the  contracted end _E_ of the larger tube (II.), so that _B_ will just fail  to pass through _E_. The length from _B_ to _C_ must not be made greater  than from _E_ to _G_ on the outside tube. The end at _C_ is then to be  cut off so as to leave a pin-hole in the end of _A_.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    The outer tube (II.), whose diameter may be 5 or 6 mm. greater than that  of _A_, is prepared by sealing a side tube on it at _F_, after  previously contracting the end _E_. For this purpose the end _E_ should  be closed and rounded, and then re-heated and blown out till the bulb  bursts. To ensure that the diameter of the opening is less than that of  the tube, care must be taken not to re-heat too large an area of the end  before blowing it out. It is very important that the cross section at  _E_ shall be in a plane at right angles to the axis of the tube.    Wrap a strip of writing paper, one inch in breadth, closely round the  end of _A_ at _C_ till the tube and paper will only just pass easily  into the mouth _D_ of the outer tube, push the inner tube _A_, with the  paper upon it, into _D_, and when the paper is entirely within _D_,  withdraw _A_, and cautiously push the paper a little further into the  outer tube. Insert _A_ into _DE_ through _E_, so that the bulb _B_ is  embraced by _E_. Close _D_ with a cork. Ascertain that the paper does  not fit sufficiently tightly between the two tubes to prevent the free  passage of air, by blowing into the mouth _K_ of _A_. Air should escape  freely from _E_ when this is done. Gradually bring the line of contact  of _B_ and _E_ and the surrounding parts of the tube before a pointed  flame, after previously warming them by holding near a larger flame, and  rotate them before the flame so that the glass may soften and adhere.  Then heat the joint spot by spot as usual. In blowing this joint, take  care that the glass on each side of the actual joint is slightly  expanded. It should present the form shown by the dotted lines in III.  (these are purposely exaggerated, however). Finally, heat the whole  joint between the lines _JI_ till it softens, and simultaneously blow  and draw it into its final shape as seen at III.    The side tube _F_ should not be too near the end _E_. If, however, it is  necessary to have them close together, the joint _F_ must be very  carefully annealed when it is made; it must also be very cautiously  warmed up before the construction of the joint at _H_ is begun, and must  be kept warm by letting the flame play over it from time to time during  the process of making the latter joint.    A good joint may be recognised by its freedom from lumps of glass, its  regularity of curve, and by a sensibly circular line at _H_, where the  two tubes are united.    When the joint after annealing has become quite cold, the pin-hole at  _C_ on the inner tube may be closed, after removing the paper support,  by warming the outer tube, and then directing a fine pointed flame  through _D_ on to _C_. And the end _D_ of the outer tube may be closed  in the ordinary manner, or a narrow tube may be sealed to it. As the end  of glass at _D_ will be too short to be held by the fingers when hot,  another piece of tube of similar diameter must be attached to it to  serve as a handle (see p. 35, Fig. 9).      =Blowing a Bulb or Globe of Glass.=--For this purpose it is very  important that the glass tube employed shall be of uniform substance.  The size and thickness of the tube to be employed depends partly on the  dimensions of the bulb desired, and partly on the size of neck that is  required for the bulb. It is easier to blow large bulbs on large-sized  tubes than on those of smaller size. When it is necessary to make a  large globe on a small tube, it can be done, however, if great care be  taken to avoid overheating that part of the small tube which is nearest  to the mass of viscous glass from which the bulb is to be formed. For  the purpose of blowing a very large bulb on a small tube, it is best to  unite a wide tube to that which is to serve as the neck, as it will save  some time in collecting the necessary mass of glass from which to form  the globe.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    _To blow a Bulb at the End of a Tube._--Select a good piece of tube, say  1.5 cm. in diameter, and about 30 cm. long; draw out one end to a light  tail (_a_, Fig. 20) about 3 inches in length. Then heat up a _short_  length of the tube at _b_, with a small brush flame, by rotating the  glass in the flame, and gently press it together when soft to thicken  it; blow into it if necessary to preserve the regularity of its figure.  Repeat this process on the portion of tube nearest to that which has  been first thickened, and so on, till as much glass has been heated and  thickened as you judge will serve to make a bulb of the size desired.  You should have a mass of glass somewhat resembling that shown at _B_  (Fig. 20), but probably consisting of the results of more successive  operations than are suggested in that diagram. Apply the flame as before  to the narrower parts _cc_ of _B_, gently compress and blow until all  the small bulbs first made are brought together into a mass still  somewhat resembling the enlarged end of _B_, but more nearly  cylindrical, with the glass as regularly distributed as possible, and of  such length from _d_ to the contracted part that the whole of it may  easily be heated simultaneously with the large brush flame of your  blow-pipe. Take great care in the foregoing operations not to allow the  sides of the mass of glass to fall in and run together, and, on the  other hand, do not reduce the thickness of the glass needlessly by  blowing it more than is necessary to give the glass as regular a form as  possible. When you are satisfied with the mass of glass you have  collected, melt off the tail _a_, and remove the pointed end of glass  that remains, as directed on page 33. Turn on as large a brush flame as  is necessary to envelop the whole mass of glass that you have collected,  and heat it with constant rotation, so that it may gradually run  together to the form seen at _C_ (Fig. 20), taking care that it does not  get overheated near _d_, or the tube which is to form the neck will  soften and give way.    The position in which the mass of heated glass is to be held will depend  upon circumstances; if the mass of glass be not too great, it is best to  keep it in a nearly horizontal position. If the mass of glass be very  large, it may be necessary to incline the end _B_ downwards; but as that  is apt to result in an excess of glass accumulating towards _d_, avoid  doing so if possible by rotating the glass steadily and rapidly. If at  any time the glass shows indications of collapsing, it must be removed  from the flame and gently blown into shape, during which operation it  may be rotated in the perpendicular position; indeed, to promote a  regular distribution of the glass by allowing it plenty of time to  collect, it is well from time to time to remove the heated mass of glass  from the flame, and slightly expand it by blowing. Finally, when a  regular mass of glass, such as is shown at _C_ (Fig. 20) has been  obtained, remove it from the flame, and blow it to its final dimensions.

And, curious enough, the foreigner  _is_ humiliated! He turns his head away as he passes Waterloo-house; he  declines crossing Waterloo-bridge, or crosses it in a passion; and even  his national dread of rain cannot induce him to ride in a Waterloo  omnibus. Of all the many profound misconceptions of English society  current in France, none, we venture to say, is more completely baseless  than the belief in the English feeling about Waterloo. Though it would  be impossible to persuade a Frenchman that omnibus proprietors, hotel  keepers, and builders were guilty of no national swagger in using the  offending word 'Waterloo.'\"          SCHALKEN THE PAINTER.--A GHOST STORY.      We take the following from a volume of of ghost stories, with  illustrations by Phiz, which has lately been published in London. One  Minheer Vanderhausen, through the means of a certain persuasive  eloquence, backed by money, becomes the husband of Rose, the niece of  Gerard Douw, and with whom Schalken, the celebrated painter's pupil, was  in love. Vanderhausen and his wife set out ostensibly for Rotterdam, but  receiving no communication from either for a long time, Gerard resolves  upon a journey to the city. No such individual as Vanderhausen is known  there, and the fate of the poor wife is told as follows:--         \"One evening, the painter and his pupil were sitting by the       fire, having accomplished a comfortable meal, and had       yielded to the silent and delicious melancholy of digestion,       when their ruminations were disturbed by a loud sound at the       street door, as if occasioned by some person rushing and       scrambling vehemently against it. A domestic had run without       delay to ascertain the cause of the disturbance, and they       heard him twice or thrice interrogate the applicant for       admission, but without eliciting any other answer but a       sustained reiteration of the sounds. They heard him then       open the hall-door, and immediately there followed a light       and rapid tread upon the staircase. Schalken advanced       towards the door. It opened before he reached it, and Rose       rushed into the room. She looked wild, fierce, and haggard       with terror and exhaustion; but her dress surprised them as       much even as her unexpected appearance. It consisted of a       kind of white woollen wrapper, made close about the neck,       and descending to the very ground. It was much deranged and       travel soiled. The poor creature had hardly entered the       chamber when she fell senseless on the floor. With some       difficulty they succeeded in reviving her; and on recovering       her senses she instantly exclaimed, in a tone of terror       rather than mere impatience, 'Wine! wine!--quickly, or I'm       lost!\"         \"Astonished, and almost scared, at the strange agitation in       which the call was made, they at once administered to her       wishes, and she drank some wine with a haste and eagerness       which surprised them. She had hardly swallowed it, when she       exclaimed, with the same urgency, 'Food, for God's sake;       food at once, or I perish!'         \"A large fragment of a roast joint was upon the table, and       Schalken immediately began to cut some; but he was       anticipated; for no sooner did she see it than she caught       it, a more than mortal image of famine, and with her hands,       and even with her teeth, she tore off the flesh, and       swallowed it. When the paroxysm of hunger had been a little       appeased, she was on a sudden overcome with shame; or it may       have been that other more agitating thoughts overpowered and       scared her, for she began to weep bitterly, and to wring her       hands.         \"'Oh! send for a minister of God!' said she; 'I am not safe       till he comes; send for him speedily.'         \"Gerard Douw dispatched a messenger instantly, and prevailed       on his niece to allow him to surrender his bedchamber to her       use. He also persuaded her to retire there at once to rest:       her consent was extorted upon the condition that they would       not leave her for a moment.         \"'Oh, that the holy man were here!' she said; 'he can       deliver me: the dead and the living can never be one; God       has forbidden it.'         \"With these mysterious words she surrendered herself to       their guidance, and they proceeded to the chamber which       Gerard Douw had assigned to her use.         \"'Do not, do not leave me for a moment!' she said; 'I am       lost for ever if you do.'         \"Gerard Douw's chamber was approached through a spacious       apartment, which they were now about to enter. He and       Schalken each carried a candle, so that a sufficiency of       light was cast upon all surrounding objects. They were now       entering the large chamber, which, as I have said,       communicated with Douw's apartment, when Rose suddenly       stopped, and, in a whisper which thrilled them both with       horror, she said, 'O God! he is here! he is here! See, see!       there he goes!'         \"She pointed towards the door of the inner room, and       Schalken thought he saw a shadowy and ill-defined form       gliding into that apartment. He drew his sword, and raising       the candle so as to throw its light with increased       distinctness upon the objects in the room, he entered the       chamber into which the shadow had glided. No figure was       there--nothing but the furniture which belonged to the room;       and yet he could not be deceived as to the fact that       something had moved before them into the chamber. A       sickening dread came upon him, and the cold perspiration       broke out in heavy drops upon his forehead; nor was he more       composed when he heard the increased urgency and agony of       entreaty with which Rose implored them not to leave her for       a moment.         \"'I saw him,' said she, 'he's here. I cannot be deceived; I       know him; he's by me; he is with me; he's in the room. Then,       for God's sake, as you would save me, do not stir from       beside me.'         \"They at length prevailed upon her to lie down upon the bed,       where she continued to urge them to stay by her. She       frequently uttered incoherent sentences, repeating again and       again, 'The dead and the living cannot be one; God has       forbidden it:' and then again, 'Rest to the wakeful--sleep       to the sleep-walkers.' These and such mysterious and broken       sentences she continued to utter until the clergyman       arrived. Gerard Douw began to fear, naturally enough, that       terror or ill-treatment had unsettled the poor girl's       intellect; and he half suspected, from the suddenness of her       appearance, the unseasonableness of the hour, and, above       all, from the wildness and terror of her manner, that she       had made her escape from some place of confinement for       lunatics, and was in imminent fear of pursuit. He resolved       to summon medical advice as soon as the mind of his niece       had been in some measure set at rest by the offices of the       clergyman whose attendance she had so earnestly desired; and       until this object had been attained, he did not venture to       put any questions to her which might possibly, by reviving       painful or horrible recollections, increase her agitation.       The clergyman soon arrived; a man of ascetic countenance and       venerable age--one whom Gerard Douw respected much,       forasmuch as he was a veteran polemic, though one perhaps       more dreaded as a combatant, than beloved as a Christian--of       pure morality, subtile brain, and frozen heart. He entered       the chamber which communicated with that in which Rose       reclined; and immediately on his arrival she requested him       to pray for her, as for one who lay in the hands of Satan,       and who could hope for deliverance only from heaven.         \"That you may distinctly understand all the circumstances of       the event which I am going to describe, it is necessary to       state the relative position of the parties who were engaged       in it. The old clergyman and Schalken were in the anteroom       of which I have already spoken; Rose lay in the inner       chamber, the door of which was open; and by the side of the       bed, at her urgent desire, stood her guardian; a candle       burned in the bedchamber, and three were lighted in the       outer apartment. The old man now cleared his voice, as if       about to commence; but before he had time to begin, a sudden       gust of air blew out the candle which served to illuminate       the room in which the poor girl lay, and she with hurried       alarm exclaimed, 'Godfrey, bring in another candle; the       darkness is unsafe.'         \"Gerard Douw, forgetting for the moment her repeated       injunctions, in the immediate impulse, stepped from the       bedchamber into the other, in order to supply what she       desired.         \"'O God! do not go dear uncle,' shrieked the unhappy girl;       and at the same time she sprang from the bed and darted       after him, in order by her grasp to detain him. But the       warning came too late; for scarcely had he passed the       threshold, and hardly had his niece had time to utter the       startling exclamation, when the door which divided the two       rooms closed violently after him, as if swung to by a strong       blast of wind. Schalken and he both rushed to the door, but       their united and desperate efforts could not avail so much       as to shake it. Shriek after shriek burst from the inner       chamber, with all the piercing loudness of despairing       terror. Schalken"]]]
