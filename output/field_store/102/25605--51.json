Others again take their turn, always  one at a time, so much so that the works are never at a standstill  and never overcrowded. Meanwhile, the multitude keeps out of the way,  quietly and patiently. There is no anxiety as to the deliverance.  Success will come: of that they are all convinced. While waiting, one  washes her antennae by passing them through her mouth, another polishes  her wings with her hind legs, another frisks about to while away the  period of inaction. Some are making love, a sovran means of killing  time, whether one be born that day or twenty years ago.    Some, I said, make love. These favored ones are rare; they hardly count.  Is it through indifference? No, but the gallants are lacking. The sexes  are very unequally represented in the population of a cell: the males  are in a wretched minority and sometimes even completely absent. This  poverty did not escape the older observers. Brulle [Gaspard August  Brulle (1809-1873)], the author of many works on natural history and one  of the founders of the Societe entomologique de France, the only author  whom I am able to consult in my hermitage, says, literally: 'The males  do not appear to be known.'    I, for my part, know them; but, considering their feeble number, I keep  asking myself what part they play in a harem so disproportionate to  their forces. A few figures will show us what my hesitations are based  upon.    In twenty-two Osmia cocoons (Osmia tricornis), the total census of the  inmates yields three hundred and fifty-four, of whom forty-seven  are males and three hundred and seven females. The average number of  inmates, therefore, is sixteen individuals; and there are six females at  least to one male. This disparity is maintained, in more or less marked  proportions, whatever the species of the bee invaded. In the cocoons of  the Mason bee of the Sheds, I discover the average proportion to be six  females to one male; in those of the Mason bee of the Walls, I find one  male to fifteen females.    These facts, which I am unable to state with any greater precision, are  enough to give rise to the suspicion that the males, who are even tinier  dwarfs than the females and who, moreover, like all insects, are injured  by a single act of pairing, must, in most cases, remain strangers to  the females. Can the mothers, in fact, dispense with their assistance,  without being deprived of offspring on that account? I do not say yes,  but I do not say no. The duality of the sexes is a hard problem. Why  two sexes? Why not just one? It would have been much simpler and saved  a great deal of foolery. Why such a thing as sex, when the tuber of the  Jerusalem artichoke can do without it? These are the pregnant questions  suggested to me, in the end, by Monodontomerus cupreus, the insect so  infinitesimal in body and so overpowering in name that I had really  vowed never to speak of it again by its official designation.          CHAPTER IV. LARVAL DIMORPHISM    If the reader has paid any attention to the story of the Anthrax, he  must have perceived that my narrative is incomplete. The fox in the  fable saw how the lion's visitors entered his den, but did not see how  they went out. With us, it is the converse: we know the way out of the  mason bee's fortress, but we do not know the way in. To leave the cell  of which he has eaten the owner, the Anthrax becomes a perforating  machine, a living tool from which our own industry might take a hint if  it required new drills for boring rocks. When the exit tunnel is opened,  this tool splits like a pod bursting in the sun; and from the stout  framework there escapes a dainty fly, a velvety flake, a soft fluff that  astounds us by its contrast with the roughness of the depths whence it  ascends. On this point, we know pretty well what there is to know. There  remains the entrance into the cell, a puzzle that has kept me on the  alert for a quarter of a century.    To begin with, it is evident that the mother cannot lodge her egg in the  cell of the mason bee, which has been long closed and barricaded with  a cement wall by the time that the Anthrax makes her appearance. To  penetrate it, she would have to become an excavating tool once more and  resume the cast-off rags which she left behind in the exit window; she  would have to retrace her steps, to be reborn a pupa; and life knows  none of these retrogressions. The full grown insect, if endowed with  claws, mandibles and plenty of perseverance, might at a pinch force the  mortar casket; but the fly is not so endowed. Her slender legs would be  strained and deformed by merely sweeping away a little dust; her mouth  is a sucker for gathering the sugary exudations of the flowers and not  the solid pincers needed for the crumbling of cement. There is no auger  either, no bore copied from that of the Leucospis, no implement of any  kind that can work its way into the thickness of the wall and dispatch  the egg to its destination. In short, the mother is absolutely incapable  of settling her eggs in the chamber of the Mason bee.    Can it be the grub that makes its own way into the storeroom, that same  grub which we have seen draining the Chalicodoma with its leech-like  kisses? Let us call the creature to mind: a little oily sausage, which  stretches and curls up just where it lies, without being able to shift  its position. Its body is a smooth cylinder; its mouth simply a  circular lip. Not one ambulatory organ does it possess; not even hairs,  protuberances or wrinkles to enable it to crawl. The animal is made  for digestion and immobility. Its organization is incompatible with  movement; everything tells us so in the clearest fashion. No, this  grub is even less able than the mother to make its way unaided into the  mason's dwelling. And yet the provisions are there; those provisions  must be reached: it is a matter of life or death; to be or not to be.  Then how does the fly set about it? It would be vain for me to question  probabilities, too often illusory; to obtain a reply of any value, I  have but one resource; I must attempt the nearly impossible and watch  the Anthrax from the egg onwards.    Although Anthrax flies are fairly common, in the sense of there being  several different species, they are not plentiful when it is a case of  wanting a colony populous enough to admit of continuous observation.  I see them, now here, now there, in the fiercely sun-scorched places,  flitting hither and thither on the old walls, the slopes and the sand,  sometimes in small platoons, most often singly. I can expect nothing  of those vagabonds, who are here today and gone tomorrow, for I know  nothing of their settlements. To keep a watch on them, one by one,  in the blazing heat, is very painful and very unfruitful, as the  swift-winged insect has a habit of disappearing one knows not whither  just when a prospect of capturing its secret begins to offer. I have  wasted many a patient hour at this pursuit, without the least result.    There might be some chance of success with Anthrax flies whose home was  known to us beforehand, especially if insects of the same species  formed a pretty numerous colony. The inquiries begun with one would  be continued with a second and with more, until a complete verdict was  forthcoming. Now, in the course of my long entomological career, I have  met with but two species of Anthrax that fulfilled this condition and  were to be found regularly: one at Carpentras; the other at Serignan.  The first, Anthrax sinuata, FALLEN, lives in the cocoons of Osmia  tricornis, who herself builds her nest in the old galleries of the  hairy-footed Anthophora; the second, Anthrax trifasciata, MEIGEN,  exploits the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I will consult both.    Once more, here am I, somewhat late in life, at Carpentras, whose rude  Gallic name sets the fool smiling and the scholar thinking. Dear little  town where I spent my twentieth year and left the first bits of my  fleece upon life's bushes, my visit of today is a pilgrimage; I have  come to lay my eyes once more upon the place which saw the birth of the  liveliest impressions of my early days. I bow, in passing, to the old  college where I tried my prentice hand as a teacher. Its appearance is  unchanged; it still looks like a penitentiary. Those were the views of  our mediaeval educational system. To the gaiety and activity of boyhood,  which were considered unwholesome, it applied the remedy of narrowness,  melancholy and gloom. Its houses of instruction were, above all, houses  of correction. The freshness of Virgil was interpreted in the stifling  atmosphere of a prison. I catch a glimpse of a yard between four high  walls, a sort of bear pit, where the scholars fought for room for their  games under the spreading branches of a plane tree. All around were  cells that looked like horse boxes, without light or air; those were the  classrooms. I speak in the past tense, for doubtless the present day has  seen the last of this academic destitution.    Here is the tobacco shop where, on Wednesday evening, coming out of the  college, I would buy on credit the wherewithal to fill my pipe and thus  to celebrate on the eve the joys of the morrow, that blessed Thursday  [the weekly half-holiday in French schools] which I considered so well  employed in solving hard equations, experimenting with new chemical  reagents, collecting and identifying my plants. I would make my timid  request, pretending to have come out without my money, for it is hard  for a self-respecting man to admit that he is penniless. My candor  appears to have inspired some little confidence; and I obtained credit,  an unprecedented thing, with the representative of the revenue. [The  government in France has the sole control of the tobacco trade, which  forms an important branch of the inland revenue.] Ah,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#9)"],[1,"honest, only cowards kissed the rod, and failed to meditate revenge on  that world of respectability which had wronged them. Each new-comer was  one more recruit to the ranks of ruffianism, and not a man penned in  that reeking den of infamy but became a sworn hater of law, order, and  \"free-men.\" What he might have been before mattered not. He was now  a prisoner, and--thrust into a suffocating barracoon, herded with  the foulest of mankind, with all imaginable depths of blasphemy  and indecency sounded hourly in his sight and hearing--he lost his  self-respect, and became what his gaolers took him to be--a wild beast  to be locked under bolts and bars, lest he should break out and tear  them.    The conversation ran upon the sudden departure of the four. What could  they want with them at that hour?    \"I tell you there's something up on deck,\" says one to the group nearest  him. \"Don't you hear all that rumbling and rolling?\"    \"What did they lower boats for? I heard the dip o' the oars.\"    \"Don't know, mate. P'r'aps a burial job,\" hazarded a short, stout  fellow, as a sort of happy suggestion.    \"One of those coves in the parlour!\" said another; and a laugh followed  the speech.    \"No such luck. You won't hang your jib for them yet awhile. More like  the skipper agone fishin'.\"    \"The skipper don't go fishin', yer fool. What would he do  fishin'?--special in the middle o' the night.\"    \"That 'ud be like old Dovery, eh?\" says a fifth, alluding to an old  grey-headed fellow, who--a returned convict--was again under sentence  for body-snatching.    \"Ay,\" put in a young man, who had the reputation of being the smartest  \"crow\" (the \"look-out\" man of a burglars' gang) in London--\"'fishers of  men,' as the parson says.\"    The snuffling imitation of a Methodist preacher was good, and there was  another laugh.    Just then a miserable little cockney pickpocket, feeling his way to the  door, fell into the party.    A volley of oaths and kicks received him.    \"I beg your pardon, gen'l'men,\" cries the miserable wretch, \"but I want  h'air.\"    \"Go to the barber's and buy a wig, then!\" says the \"Crow\", elated at the  success of his last sally.    \"Oh, sir, my back!\"    \"Get up!\" groaned someone in the darkness. \"Oh, Lord, I'm smothering!  Here, sentry!\"    \"Vater!\" cried the little cockney. \"Give us a drop o' vater, for mercy's  sake. I haven't moist'ned my chaffer this blessed day.\"    \"Half a gallon a day, bo', and no more,\" says a sailor next him.    \"Yes, what have yer done with yer half-gallon, eh?\" asked the Crow  derisively. \"Someone stole it,\" said the sufferer.    \"He's been an' blued it,\" squealed someone. \"Been an' blued it to buy  a Sunday veskit with! Oh, ain't he a vicked young man?\" And the speaker  hid his head under the blankets, in humorous affectation of modesty.    All this time the miserable little cockney--he was a tailor by  trade--had been grovelling under the feet of the Crow and his  companions.    \"Let me h'up, gents\" he implored--\"let me h'up. I feel as if I should  die--I do.\"    \"Let the gentleman up,\" says the humorist in the bunk. \"Don't yer see  his kerridge is avaitin' to take him to the Hopera?\"    The conversation had got a little loud, and, from the topmost bunk on  the near side, a bullet head protruded.    \"Ain't a cove to get no sleep?\" cried a gruff voice. \"My blood, if I  have to turn out, I'll knock some of your empty heads together.\"    It seemed that the speaker was a man of mark, for the noise ceased  instantly; and, in the lull which ensued, a shrill scream broke from the  wretched tailor.    \"Help! they're killing me! Ah-h-h-!\"    \"Wot's the matter,\" roared the silencer of the riot, jumping from his  berth, and scattering the Crow and his companions right and left. \"Let  him be, can't yer?\"    \"H'air!\" cried the poor devil--\"h'air; I'm fainting!\"    Just then there came another groan from the man in the opposite bunk.  \"Well, I'm blessed!\" said the giant, as he held the gasping tailor by  the collar and glared round him. \"Here's a pretty go! All the blessed  chickens ha' got the croup!\"    The groaning of the man in the bunk redoubled.    \"Pass the word to the sentry,\" says someone more humane than the rest.  \"Ah,\" says the humorist, \"pass him out; it'll be one the less. We'd  rather have his room than his company.\"    \"Sentry, here's a man sick.\"    But the sentry knew his duty better than to reply. He was a young  soldier, but he had been well informed of the artfulness of convict  stratagems; and, moreover, Captain Vickers had carefully apprised  him \"that by the King's Regulations, he was forbidden to reply to any  question or communication addressed to him by a convict, but, in the  event of being addressed, was to call the non-commissioned officer on  duty.\" Now, though he was within easy hailing distance of the guard  on the quarter-deck, he felt a natural disinclination to disturb those  gentlemen merely for the sake of a sick convict, and knowing that, in  a few minutes, the third relief would come on duty, he decided to wait  until then.    In the meantime the tailor grew worse, and began to moan dismally.    \"Here! 'ullo!\" called out his supporter, in dismay. \"Hold up 'ere! Wot's  wrong with yer? Don't come the drops 'ere. Pass him down, some of yer,\"  and the wretch was hustled down to the doorway.    \"Vater!\" he whispered, beating feebly with his hand on the thick oak.    \"Get us a drink, mister, for Gord's sake!\"    But the prudent sentry answered never a word, until the ship's bell  warned him of the approach of the relief guard; and then honest old  Pine, coming with anxious face to inquire after his charge, received  the intelligence that there was another prisoner sick. He had the door  unlocked and the tailor outside in an instant. One look at the flushed,  anxious face was enough.    \"Who's that moaning in there?\" he asked.    It was the man who had tried to call for the sentry an hour back, and  Pine had him out also; convictism beginning to wonder a little.    \"Take 'em both aft to the hospital,\" he said; \"and, Jenkins, if there  are any more men taken sick, let them pass the word for me at once. I  shall be on deck.\"    The guard stared in each other's faces, with some alarm, but said  nothing, thinking more of the burning ship, which now flamed furiously  across the placid water, than of peril nearer home; but as Pine went up  the hatchway he met Blunt.    \"We've got the fever aboard!\"    \"Good God! Do you mean it, Pine?\"    Pine shook his grizzled head sorrowfully.    \"It's this cursed calm that's done it; though I expected it all along,  with the ship crammed as she is. When I was in the Hecuba--\"    \"Who is it?\"    Pine laughed a half-pitying, half-angry laugh.    \"A convict, of course. Who else should it be? They are reeking like  bullocks at Smithfield down there. A hundred and eighty men penned  into a place fifty feet long, with the air like an oven--what could you  expect?\"    Poor Blunt stamped his foot.    \"It isn't my fault,\" he cried. \"The soldiers are berthed aft. If the  Government will overload these ships, I can't help it.\"    \"The Government! Ah! The Government! The Government don't sleep, sixty  men a-side, in a cabin only six feet high. The Government don't get  typhus fever in the tropics, does it?\"    \"No--but--\"    \"But what does the Government care, then?\"    Blunt wiped his hot forehead.    \"Who was the first down?\"    \"No. 97 berth; ten on the lower tier. John Rex he calls himself.\"    \"Are you sure it's the fever?\"    \"As sure as I can be yet. Head like a fire-ball, and tongue like a strip  of leather. Gad, don't I know it?\" and Pine grinned mournfully. \"I've  got him moved into the hospital. Hospital! It is a hospital! As dark as  a wolf's mouth. I've seen dog kennels I liked better.\"    Blunt nodded towards the volume of lurid smoke that rolled up out of the  glow.--\"Suppose there is a shipload of those poor devils? I can't refuse  to take 'em in.\"    \"No,\" says Pine gloomily, \"I suppose you can't. If they come, I must  stow 'em somewhere. We'll have to run for the Cape, with the first  breeze, if they do come, that is all I can see for it,\" and he turned  away to watch the burning vessel.          CHAPTER VI. THE FATE OF THE \"HYDASPES\".        In the meanwhile the two boats made straight for the red column that  uprose like a gigantic torch over the silent sea.    As Blunt had said, the burning ship lay a good twelve miles from the  Malabar, and the pull was a long and a weary one. Once fairly away from  the protecting sides of the vessel that had borne them thus far on  their dismal journey, the adventurers seemed to have come into a new  atmosphere. The immensity of the ocean over which they slowly moved  revealed itself for the first time. On board the prison ship, surrounded  with all the memories if not with the comforts of the shore they had  quitted, they had not realized how far they were from that civilization  which had given them birth. The well-lighted, well-furnished cuddy, the  homely mirth of the forecastle, the setting of sentries and the changing  of guards, even the gloom and terror of the closely-locked prison,  combined to make the voyagers feel secure against the unknown dangers of  the sea. That defiance of Nature which is born of contact with humanity,  had hitherto sustained them, and they felt that, though alone on the  vast expanse of waters, they were in companionship with others of their  kind, and that the perils one man had passed might be successfully dared  by another. But now--with one ship growing smaller behind them, and the  other, containing they knew not what horror of human agony and human  helplessness, lying a burning wreck in the black distance ahead of  them--they began to feel their own littleness. The Malabar, that huge  sea monster, in whose capacious belly so many human creatures lived and  suffered, had dwindled to a walnut-shell, and yet beside her bulk"]]]
