At the end of the fourth day of Russell's complete isolation a despair  settled upon the country. England was staggered by the uniqueness of  these phenomena. The French Academy of Sciences, after a prolonged  sitting, announced that they could suggest no solution. It is only too  well remembered that the newspaper bulletins were besieged in our own  cities, but these offered no further information or encouragement. Was  advanced civilization responsible for this disaster or not? That was the  burning question. Or was this a special visitation of God, a plague new  to the medical world, spontaneously generated, sporadic in its  appearance, and destined forever to be an _obscurum per obscurius_ or  perhaps to spread with further undetermined horrors?    Thousands were now on the ground. They encompassed that section about as  Joshua did the city of Jericho, as the settlers did the Territory of  Oklahoma on the day of its opening, as the rabble do a house when a  murder has been committed.    On the evening of the fourth day from the time when the messenger boy  brought the first despatch to the office of the _Daily Planet_, its  chief, obviously nervous for the first time in his public life, received  the following cipher telegram, which cheered him wonderfully:         \"_On the spot. Situation desperate. Worse than described. Will       penetrate to Russell or die. Dead line still impassable. Trust       me._         \"SWIFT\"          III.      When Swift boarded the Western express he walked through, starting from  the last car, to see if any rival reporters happened to be there for the  same purpose. He scanned the backs of the heads of the passengers first,  and then looked keenly into each man's face as he passed. He had, in  common with all newspaper men, the detective instinct. Who knew what  eminent defaulter or renowned cracksman was fleeing the city in dark  disguise? However, he observed no familiar or suspicious character until  he entered the smoking car.    He did not go through, for, although a great smoker, he took no pleasure  in indulging in his favorite vice in the air of a democratic smoking  car. What fastidious smoker does? He was content to let his eyes wander  up and down the aisle. He was about to turn, when his gaze fell upon the  back of a dingy linen duster, which was surmounted by a large, faded,  black sombrero. The man under these garments had the upper part of his  face hidden beneath the broad flap of his hat, while the under part of  his face was entirely submerged in a large pamphlet. The man had the air  of extreme retirement. Something about the dinginess of the felt hat  seemed familiar to Swift. But, no; it could not be. To make sure, the  new editor of the _Planet_ approached, and bent behind the man. The  gentleman was ignorant of the attention he attracted, and did not stir.  He seemed to be engrossed in one of Mr. Atkinson's incomprehensible  financial reports. Swift caught sight of the travellers face, started  back in amazement, and said:    \"Excuse me, sir: is this seat engaged?\" and without further ceremony sat  down beside the recondite stranger, who dropped his paper and stared at  Swift in return.    \"Great Caesar!\" blurted out Swift. \"How the D--epartment did you come  here?\"    \"On the five fifty-eight elevated,\" replied the man, imperturbably.    \"I--I didn't know you were sent, too.\" Swift's heart burned within him  at the fancied slight.    \"I wasn't,\" answered Mr. Statis Ticks, laconically and wearily.    \"Where the dickens are you going, then?\" asked Swift, warmly.    \"To Russell, of course.\"    \"How on earth did you get off?\"    \"I didn't, young man. I skipped.\" This exceptional occasion doubtless  accounted for the only bit of slang that was ever heard to fall from  those dry lips. \"You see,\" proceeded Mr. Ticks drearily, \"the  circumstance is a little unusual. I have read of nothing similar in the  casualty reports. I thought it best for my reputation to make my own  personal observations and figures on the spot.\"    \"But your position?\" asked Swift in surprise.    Mr. Statis Ticks raised his head proudly.    \"If the _Planet_ can get on without me, let it!\"    \"But your family?\" continued Swift, somewhat dazed. Who had suspected  this animated reference library of such enterprise?    \"I sent messenger number thirty-seven to them,\" he answered with a sigh,  as if he were bored by such trifles.    Then considering this topic exhausted, Mr. Ticks took out his notebook  and looked absently out of the window; now and then he jotted down a few  abstruse figures. He was engrossed in calculating the farm acreage  adjacent to the railroad track between New York and Albany.    When they drew nearer to the region of the catastrophe the papers gave  more lurid accounts of it. These were purchased and read with avidity by  those on board the flying express. Groups centred in the cars talked  only of one thing. Reporters now joined the train at each prominent  city.    As the train approached the stricken territory it became crammed to  suffocation. It crept at a funeral pace. People fought at each station  for seats. The train split into sections on account of the added cars,  filled with mourners, with rescuers, with sight-seers, with villains.    Swift now took to himself a certain measure of authority. Was he not the  experienced representative of the greatest daily in America? But no one  noticed Mr. Statis Ticks, who silently blinked at the excited crowds and  then jotted down his estimates of them.    On the afternoon of the fourth day Swift bounded from the front platform  of the baggage car, the first to leave the train, and looked with a  professional eye about him. The scene that met his quick gaze was  unprecedented. Clamoring, gesticulating, shrieking, crying men and women  were rushing here and there in frenzy. Here was a group of women wailing  for their husbands, imprisoned or dead--and who knew which?--within that  awful circle. There a man looked, vacantly, with trembling lips, from  group to group, hunting for the wife snatched from him. Here was a rude  fellow peddling half a bushel of potatoes from a rickety farm wagon.  There a woman, hungry and desperate, was aimlessly dragging an orphan  child about. Yonder a confidence man was set upon and beaten by  infuriated victims. In the midst of a jostling, eager, credulous mob was  a man who fancied he had some real news to tell.    Now and then, as if by mutual consent, these people lifted up their  heads towards the Great Buzzard mountains, toward Russell, the city of  their despair, and clenched their fists and uttered an exasperated  groan. Agents of the Red Cross Society and of the Law and Order League  had already erected their tents, and were doing all they could to  restrain the lawlessness and relieve the discomforts of the mob. Swift  critically watched these seething thousands, who had come upon the spot  from motives of sorrow, curiosity, gain, and plunder, all miserable,  poorly housed and scantily fed. The reporter's inquisitiveness was well  ahead of his human sympathy up to this point.    Within these few days the border line about the afflicted city had  become an improvised camp, that extended for miles and miles. It was  enforced here by a railroad track, there by a village, until, having  completed the gigantic circle, it met again. Thousands were flowing in  each hour. They came from all points of the compass, like flocks of  angels and of devils. As yet the military was not at hand, and the  little law that existed was not of the gospel, but of brute force and  adroitness.    Swift, having sent off his dispatch at the improvised office, and having  forgotten his companion, whom he expected to be a nuisance on his hands,  retraced his steps and hurried to the dead line, where it impinged on  the railroad track. Here was the centre of the maddest rush. Here men  groaned and cursed and wept aloud. Swift pushed his way through until he  reached that portion of the track that defied further passage. A cord  had been stretched there to keep the crowds back. Upon showing his badge  he was received with respect.    \"Take keer, boss,\" said the huge policeman, whose sole duty up to this  time had been to drive the spikes into the sleepers. \"I tried it  yesterday. They just pulled me out. I got the d--d shakes yet.\" With a  grave smile Swift ducked under the rope and looked before him. The  solitary, motionless, blasted prairie stretched out, relieved only by  the outlines of the Buzzard mountains. Where once the tops of towers,  grain elevators and steeples were to be seen on the horizon, there was a  cloud. A dense, strange, ominous mist overhung the stricken city.    This cloud was of a yellowish color that recalled to Swift the dreadful  yellow day of '72. It reached nearly to the summit of the great Buzzard  mountain. Within five miles of the spot on which he stood this  phenomenon became more and more attenuated until it disappeared in dull  transparency. What did that cloud contain? What horrors did it hide? Of  what was its nature? What was the secret of its deadly influence? No  American catastrophe had impressed the reporter so much as the sight of  this veil, hiding the unattainable city. Curse this maledict, deadly  vapor! It paralyzed his inventiveness. It baffled his imagination. For  the first time in his reportorial career Swift was stunned and without  resource.    Now it was said that not a breath of air had stirred over the polluted  area since the morning of the loss of Russell.    As the news editor looked down the tracks he saw that the tracks, which  were torn up and twisted beneath him, within a hundred feet, disappeared  utterly from view. The wooden ties were blackened into "]]]
