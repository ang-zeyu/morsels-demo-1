She had used it to kill geese, hogs, and cattle of her neighbors. At  length she had employed it to kill a neighbor whom she disliked, and  finally her own husband. The woman's eighteen-year-old daughter, Joan,  was now called to the stand and confirmed the fact that her mother kept  a toad. She herself had one day been refused a piece of bread and cheese  by a neighbor's child and had invoked the toad's help. The toad promised  to assist her if she would surrender her soul. She did so. Then the toad  haunted the neighbor's girl in the form of a dog with horns. The mother  was again called to the stand and repeated the curious story told by her  daughter.    Now the neighbor's child, Agnes Brown, was brought in to testify. Her  story tallied in some of its details with that of the two Waterhouse  women; she had been haunted by the horned dog, and she added certain  descriptions of its conduct that revealed good play of childish  imagination.[2]    The attorney put some questions, but rather to lead on the witnesses  than to entangle them. He succeeded, however, in creating a violent  altercation between the Waterhouses on the one hand, and Agnes Brown on  the other, over trifling matters of detail.[3] At length he offered to  release Mother Waterhouse if she would make the spirit appear in the  court.[4] The offer was waived. The attorney then asked, \"When dyd thye  Cat suck of thy bloud?\" \"Never,\" said she. He commanded the jailer to  lift up the \"kercher\" on the woman's head. He did so and the spots on  her face and nose where she had pricked herself for the evil spirit were  exposed.    The jury retired. Two days later Agnes Waterhouse suffered the penalty  of the law, not however until she had added to her confessions.[5]    The case is a baffling one. We can be quite sure that the pamphlet  account is incomplete. One would like to know more about the substance  of fact behind this evidence. Did the parties that were said to have  been killed by witchcraft really die at the times specified? Either the  facts of their deaths were well known in the community and were fitted  with great cleverness into the story Mother Waterhouse told, or the  jurors and the judges neglected the first principles of common sense and  failed to inquire about the facts.[6] The questions asked by the queen's  attorney reveal hardly more than an unintelligent curiosity to know the  rest of the story. He shows just one saving glint of skepticism. He  offered to release Mother Waterhouse if she would materialize her  spirit.    Mother Waterhouse was her own worst enemy. Her own testimony was the  principal evidence presented against her, and yet she denied guilt on  one particular upon which the attorney-general had interrogated her.  This might lead one to suppose that her answers were the haphazard  replies of a half-witted woman. But the supposition is by no means  consistent with the very definite and clear-cut nature of her testimony.  It is useless to try to unravel the tangles of the case. It is possible  that under some sort of duress--although there is no evidence of  this--she had deliberately concocted a story to fit those of Elizabeth  Francis and Agnes Brown, and that her daughter, hearing her mother's  narrative in court--a very possible thing in that day--had fitted hers  into it. It is conceivable too that Mother Waterhouse had yielded merely  to the wish to amaze her listeners. It is a more probable supposition  that the questions asked of her by the judge were based upon the  accusations already made by Agnes Brown and that they suggested to her  the main outlines of her narrative.    Elizabeth Francis, who had been the first accused and who had accused  Mother Waterhouse, escaped. Whether it was because she had turned  state's evidence or because she had influential friends in the  community, we do not know. It is possible that the judges recognized  that her confession was unsupported by the testimony of other witnesses.  Such a supposition, however, credits the court with keener  discrimination than seems ever to have been exhibited in such cases in  the sixteenth century.[7]    But, though Elizabeth Francis had escaped, her reputation as a dangerous  woman in the community was fixed. Thirteen years later she was again put  on trial before the itinerant justices. This brings us to the second  trial of witches at Chelmsford in 1579. Mistress Francis's examination  elicited less than in the first trial. She had cursed a woman \"and badde  a mischief to light uppon her.\" The woman, she understood, was  grievously pained. She followed the course that she had taken before  and began to accuse others. We know very little as to the outcome. At  least one of the women accused went free because \"manslaughter or murder  was not objected against her.\"[8] Three women, however, were condemned  and executed. One of them was almost certainly Elleine Smith, daughter  of a woman hanged as a witch,--another illustration of the persistence  of suspicion against the members of a family.    The Chelmsford affair of 1579[9] was not unlike that of 1566. There were  the same tales of spirits that assumed animal forms. The young son of  Elleine Smith declared that his mother kept three spirits, Great Dick in  a wicker bottle, Little Dick in a leathern bottle, and Willet in a  wool-pack. Goodwife Webb saw \"a thyng like a black Dogge goe out of her  doore.\" But the general character of the testimony in the second trial  bore no relation to that in the first. There was no agreement of the  different witnesses. The evidence was haphazard. The witch and another  woman had a falling out--fallings out were very common. Next day the  woman was taken ill. This was the sort of unimpeachable testimony that  was to be accepted for a century yet. In the affair of 1566 the judges  had made some attempt at quizzing the witnesses, but in 1579 all  testimony was seemingly rated at par.[10] In both instances the proof  rested mainly upon confession. Every woman executed had made  confessions of guilt. This of course was deemed sufficient. Nevertheless  the courts were beginning to introduce other methods of proving the  accused guilty. The marks on Agnes Waterhouse had been uncovered at the  request of the attorney-general; and at her execution she had been  questioned about her ability to say the Lord's Prayer and other parts of  the service. Neither of these matters was emphasized, but the mention of  them proves that notions were already current that were later to have  great vogue.    The Chelmsford cases find their greatest significance, however, not as  illustrations of the use and abuse of evidence, but because they  exemplify the continuity of the witch movement. That continuity finds  further illustration in the fact that there was a third alarm at  Chelmsford in 1589, which resulted in three more executions. But in this  case the women involved seem, so far as we know, to have had no  connection with the earlier cases. The fate of Elizabeth Francis and  that of Elleine Smith are more instructive as proof of the long-standing  nature of a community suspicion. Elleine could not escape her mother's  reputation nor Elizabeth her own.    Both these women seem to have been of low character at any rate.  Elizabeth had admitted illicit amours, and Elleine may very well have  been guilty on the same count.[11] All of the women involved in the two  trials were in circumstances of wretched poverty; most, if not all, of  them were dependent upon begging and the poor relief for support.[12]    It is easy to imagine the excitement in Essex that these trials must  have produced. The accused had represented a wide territory in the  county. The women had been fetched to Chelmsford from towns as far apart  as Hatfield-Peverel and Maldon. It is not remarkable that three years  later than the affair of 1579 there should have been another outbreak in  the county, this time in a more aggravated form. St. Oses, or St.  Osyth's, to the northeast of Chelmsford, was to be the scene of the most  remarkable affair of its kind in Elizabethan times. The alarm began with  the formulation of charges against a woman of the community. Ursley Kemp  was a poor woman of doubtful reputation. She rendered miscellaneous  services to her neighbors. She acted as midwife, nursed children, and  added to her income by \"unwitching\" the diseased. Like other women of  the sort, she was looked upon with suspicion. Hence, when she had been  refused the nursing of the child of Grace Thurlow, a servant of that Mr.  Darcy who was later to try her, and when the child soon afterward fell  out of its cradle and broke its neck, the mother suspected Ursley of  witchcraft. Nevertheless she did not refuse her help when she \"began to  have a lameness in her bones.\" Ursley promised to unwitch her and  seemingly kept her word, for the lameness disappeared. Then it was that  the nurse-woman asked for the twelve-pence she had been promised and was  refused. Grace pleaded that she was a \"poore and needie woman.\" Ursley  became angry and threatened to be even with her. The lameness reappeared  and Grace Thurlow was thoroughly convinced that Ursley was to blame.  When the case was carried before the justices of the peace, the accused  woman denied that she was guilty of anything more than unwitching the  afflicted. That she had learned, she said, ten or more years ago from a  woman now deceased. She was committed to the assizes, and Justice Brian  Darcy, whose servant Grace Thurlow had started the trouble, took the  case in hand. He examined her eight-year-old \"base son,\" who gave  damning evidence against his mother. She fed four imps, Tyffin, Tittey,  Piggen, and Jacket. The boy's testimony and the judge's promise that if  she would confess the truth she \"would have favour,\" seemed to break  down the woman's resolution. \"Bursting out with weeping she fell "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#9)"],[1,"friction in married  life. It sounds farcical, but I am perfectly serious. Food, the ordering  and cooking of it and the subsequent paying for it, is one of the great  tragedies of a wife's existence. Time, the great healer, mercifully  deadens the intensity of this anguish, and matrons of fifty or so can  face the daily burden of food-ordering with something like indifference.  But to a woman who has not yet reached the fatal landmark aptly  described as 'the same age as everybody else, namely, thirty-five,' it  is the greatest cross, whilst many a bride has had her early married  life totally ruined by the horrid and ever recurring necessity of  finding food for her partner. Men make fun of women because their  dinner, when alone, so often consists of an egg for tea, but women have  such a constitutional hatred of food-ordering, inherited, no doubt, from  a long line of suffering female ancestry, that the majority of them  would gladly live on tea and bread-and-butter for the rest of their  lives sooner than face the necessity of daily meditating on a menu. For  this reason I believe vegetarian husbands are particularly desirable,  since the whole principle of food-reform is simplicity. Those who go in  for it acquire an entirely fresh set of ideas on the importance of food,  and become quite pathetically easily pleased. I know a woman whose  husband is a vegetarian and she declared that the food question, so  disturbing a factor in most homes, had never caused her a single tear,  or frown, or angry word, or added wrinkle. She assured me that her  husband would cheerfully breakfast off a banana, lunch off a lettuce,  dine on a date and sup on a salted almond. When the house was upset on  the occasion of a large evening party and there were no conveniences for  the ordinary family dinner, the creature actually ate cheese sandwiches  in the bathroom, by way of a dinner, and was quite pleased to do so,  moreover! I could scarcely credit it at first, but it was really true.    Of the many paltry little causes for friction in married life  incompatibility of temperature has doubtless been a very fruitful source  of dissension. If one shivers when the window is opened and the other is  a fresh-air faddist and can't breathe with it shut, an endless vista of  possibilities of unhappiness is opened out. It was, I believe,  Napoleon's second wife, Marie Louise, who always got rid of her husband  when she wished to, by merely keeping her apartments cold. The great man  was only comfortable in a very hot room with a blazing fire.    That grievous deficiency, no sense of humour, is another of the tiny  little rocks on which married happiness often splits. This is natural  enough, since an absence of this priceless quality is about the worst  deprivation a traveller on life's journey can suffer from. Among men the  conviction is rife that women invariably suffer thus, but I think we can  afford to leave them this delusion, since it affords them so much  satisfaction. At one time I had a journalist friend of a painfully  stodgy and unusually depressing literary habit. This poor soul fancied  his vein was humour, and from him I have often endured the reading aloud  of the dreariest laboured pages of japes and jests, which to his  thinking were sparkling with wit. My patient, long-suffering listening  only brought bitter derision for my alleged lack of humorous perception,  but my criticism inspired the young man to write a cynical article on  'Women and Humour,' of the kind that editors--being men--delight in,  and for which he consequently got well paid.    As a fact, the things that amuse men frequently fail to amuse women and  _vice versa_ but it is surely illogical to deduce from this that women's  humorous sense is inferior to men's--or non-existent. As, however, this  apparently insignificant question is of such importance in life  generally, whether it be in a palace, a convent, a villa or a  workhouse--I think a wife would be well-advised to assume amusement if  she feels it not, laugh with her lord even when she doesn't see the  point, and cultivate indifference when he fails to laugh with her.    Writers on marriage seem to have paid very little attention to this  important point. Stevenson is one of the exceptions: 'That people should  laugh over the same sort of jest,' he says, 'and have many an old joke  between them which time cannot wither or custom stale is a better  preparation for life, by your leave, than many other things higher and  better-sounding in the world's ears. You could read Kant by yourself,  if you wanted; but you must share a joke with someone else.'    In a beautiful poem, Stephen Phillips describes how a bereaved lover can  think calmly of his dead, when he looked at her possessions, the things  she had worn, even when he read her letters; and her saddest words had  no power to pain him, but when he came to--      'A hurried, happy line!    A little jest too slight for one so dead:    This did I not endure--    Then with a shuddering heart no more I read,'    In truth, the little joke shared, the old allusion at which both are  accustomed to laugh, is a more potent bond than many a deeper feeling.  One can recall these trifles long after one has forgotten the poignant  moments of passion, the breathless heartbeats, the wild embraces which  at the time seemed to promise such deathless memories. All, all are  forgotten, but the silly little joke has still the power to bring tears  to our eyes if the one with whom we shared it is lost to us.       *   *   *    A great many people are wretched who would have been perfectly happy  with another partner. 'In the inequalities of temperament lies the main  cause of unhappiness in marriage. Want of harmony in tastes counts for  much, but a misfit in temperament for more.' So ludicrously mismated are  some couples that one wonders how they could ever have dreamed of  finding happiness together. This again is frequently the fault of our  absurd conventions, which make it so difficult for single young men and  women to really get to know each other. However, things have improved so  much in this direction during the last decade or two that we ought not  to grumble, but, even now, if a man show a decided preference for a  girl's company his name is at once coupled with hers in a manner which  can but alarm a youth devoid of matrimonial intentions. That relic of  the dark ages, the intention-asking parent, is by no means extinct, and  many a promising friendship that might have ended in a happy marriage is  spoilt by the clumsy intervention of this barbaric relative.    A young barrister friend of mine--we will call him Anthony--once tried,  for reasons of professional policy, to make himself agreeable to a  solicitor with a very large family of daughters. Being a shrewd man,  he selected one of the girls still in the schoolroom to pay particular  attention to, and thus escaped the necessity of showing special interest  in her elder and marriageable sisters. His intimacy with the family  prospered, and the father became a very useful patron. However, as time  went on, he discovered to his dismay that his little friend, Amaryllis,  had grown up and that he was regarded in the family as her special  property. Speedily he transferred his attachment to Aphrodite, the  youngest girl then in the schoolroom, and by this means saved himself  from an entanglement with Amaryllis, whilst at the same time preserving  the valuable friendship of her father. In an incredibly short time,  however, Aphrodite was nubile, and the family once more expectant of  securing Anthony as a permanent member. Once again he executed the same  manoeuvre, choosing this time the little Andromeda, a plain child still  in the nursery. The family, though disappointed, remained hopeful, and  the years passed peacefully on, bringing a few sons-in-law in their  train, and innumerable boxes of sweets to the unprepossessing Andromeda.  When, however, Andromeda too grew up, the wily Anthony feared his  fruitful friendship must inevitably come to an end, since the only  remaining daughter had already reached the dangerous age of fifteen,  and bore moreover the improper name of Anactoria!    A long friendship and a short engagement is perhaps the best  combination. A prolonged engagement is the most trying relationship  between the sexes possible to conceive. For the woman it means the  drawbacks of matrimony without its charm of restful finality, or any of  its solid worldly advantages. On the man's side it means the irksomeness  of the marriage yoke without any of its satisfactions and comforts. On  the man, indeed, a long engagement is especially hard, as at least the  woman is spared the burden of ordering his food and coping with his  servants. Many a sincere affection has been killed by the restraints and  irritations of a long engagement. Many a genuine passion has waned  during its dreary course, until but a feeble spark of the great flame is  left to light the wedded life, and both man and woman carry the mark of  that suppressed ardour which, under happier circumstances, might have  come to a joyous fruition. Their children, too, sometimes lack vitality,  and show the need of the fire that died before they were begotten.       *   *   *    I don't know who it was who first coined the phrase 'the appalling  intimacy of married life'; certainly it is an apt expression, and one  wonders at what period in the world's history men and women began to  find that intimacy 'appalling.' It sounds a modern enough complaint, and  somehow one feels sure it was never indulged in by our grandmothers, who  looked upon their husbands as a kind of visible embodiment of the Lord's  Will, and respected them accordingly. They would never have dreamed of  finding irksome what Mrs Lynn Linton called the '_chair-a-chair_  closeness of the English home.'    Much has been written of the degradation of love by"]]]
