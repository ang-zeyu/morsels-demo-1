Euphausiids have historically been the primary feed within Glacier Bay  in July-August, although little research has been done to compare  yearly levels of this feed or to determine what level is necessary to  support the whales. The only available information derives from  vertical plankton tows by the REGINA MARIS in August 1979, which  indicated that fewer euphausiids (5 percent) occurred in Glacier Bay  as compared to Frederick Sound-Stephens Passage. The humpbacks may  have found the Glacier Bay food levels to be too low, particularly in  the face of continued high vessel use, and simply departed to search  for better concentrations elsewhere.    A similar abandonment of a prime feeding area, the Grand Banks, was  observed for the Northwest Atlantic humpback population and was  thought to be associated with the overfishing of capelin stocks there.  Consequently, the occurrence and distribution of humpback whales may  be generally dependent upon the occurrence and availability of its  desired prey species.    In a worst case analysis, Glacier Bay is a feeding ground, and its  long-term abandonment would not be conducive to the conservation of  the humpback whale. Up to 20 or 25 individual whales would relocate to  other areas, increasing competition for food there. In such case a  greater expenditure of energy might be required to obtain the same  quantities of food than would be required in Glacier Bay. An increased  energy expenditure would tend to decrease the likelihood of humpbacks  successfully increasing their numbers, since growth and the onset of  sexual maturity would be delayed.      =Conclusions=    Our present interpretation of the available data is that uncontrolled  increase of vessel traffic, particularly of erratically traveling  charter/pleasure craft, probably has altered the behavior of humpback  whales in Glacier Bay and thus may be implicated in their departure  from the Bay the past two years. Our conclusion, then, is that  continued increase in the amount of vessel traffic, particularly  charter/pleasure craft, in Glacier Bay is likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of the humpback whale population frequenting  Southeast Alaska. The alteration in the distribution of the whales in  Southeast Alaska can be expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood  of the recovery of the North Pacific humpback population, especially  when viewed as an incremental aggravation of the problem of  humpback/human interaction in general.      =Recommendations=    Until research reveals the need for more specific action, if any, we  offer the following as reasonable and prudent alternatives that the  NPS should institute in Glacier Bay to avoid jeopardizing the  continued existence of the North Pacific population of humpback  whales:    We recommend that total vessel use of the Bay be restricted to 1976  levels, at the very least, since that year preceeded the high point of  visitor use in Glacier Bay during 1977. Commercial use of the Bay is  predicated on a permit system that should offer good control and  accountability of the tour industry. The routing of large vessels is  relatively easy to regulate. Recreational craft present the greater  challenge to management control. The continuing increase in the amount  of recreational traffic in the Bay lends considerable urgency to  establishing effective controls.    Collectively, regulations should address vessel routing and vessel  maneuvering. The NPS has already regulated these activities to some  extent. Specific routes should be published, but the system should be  flexible enough to accommodate changes of areas of concentrated  feeding activity.    We further recommend curtailment of vessel operator discretion in  pursuing, or approaching, whales. General guidelines prohibiting the  pursuit or willful or persistent disturbance of whales through vessel  maneuvering probably would offer better enforceability and public  compliance than would detailed regulations based on specified  distances. Vessel operator behavior should receive a thorough public  educational effort, possibly through an informative notice to each  vessel.    Finally, we recommend that monitoring of the humpback population and  of whale-vessel interactions be continued and that all current data be  fully analyzed. New research should also be undertaken (1) to  characterize the food and feeding behavior of humpback whales in  Glacier Bay and other areas; (2) to ascertain the acoustic  characteristics of vessels within the Bay and in other areas with the  aim of identifying equipment and/or modes of operation which are  inimical to the whales; and (3) to compare behavioral responses of the  humpbacks to vessels in Glacier Bay with those observed in other areas  of southeastern Alaska.    The conclusions and recommendations stated herein constitute our  biological opinion, and we consider consultation on this matter to be  at an end. Should significant new information or factors not  considered in this opinion arise, however, either we or NPS are  obligated to reinitiate consultation.

I told him that I was not racing and that he would scare the game. In  fact, he did start one little fellow, but he said he always saw the game  first, and for this day I was quite powerless to hold him in; so I  decided to return to camp before dark. This disgusted Anastasio greatly.  \"In this way we shall never kill,\" said he. \"We are going to suffer from  hunger.\" I assured him that we had plentiful supplies, but he had come  for meat. Unbounded meat had been the chief incentive for his trip, and  hungry he was determined to be.    The next day J. B. set out early with the red man. I arranged camp, and  two or three hours later took what I supposed was a different direction,  but soon encountered the pair returning. J. B. had a painful knee, and  Anastasio had started his racing tactics and kept them up until J. B.  was quite lame.    The Indian reported that he had seen sheep. J. B. had used the glass  without finding them, and then Anastasio had captured it and looked  through the wrong end, nodding and saying he could count five, very big.  This, I am sorry to say, was false and affected on Anastasio's part, and  J. B. was skeptical about the sheep altogether; but I knew how hard it  was to find distant game, when you don't know exactly how it should  appear. To reach the supposed sheep, the mountain must be climbed and  the crest turned, for the wind permitted no other course. J. B. did not  feel up to the task, and I directed him to camp. Anastasio and I climbed  for about four hours, and reached a position whence his sheep would be  visible. He was now discontented because J. B. had not lent him his gun.  No request had been made for the gun, to be sure, but I confess that a  request would have met with my earnest opposition in any event.  Evidently Anastasio's expectations of fresh meat were now so dim as to  cast serious shadows on my skill as a hunter; but, resigning himself to  the inevitable, he crawled to the summit of the ridge for a view. He  stared long and said he could make out one ewe lying down under a  juniper. I tried the glass. He was right. His unaided sight seemed about  equal in definition to my field-glass. On this occasion he declined to  use the glass, even with some appearance of disgust. We could get no  nearer unseen, and, though the distance was very great, I decided to  risk a shot.    I fired, in fact, two or three shots at the ewe, alarming her greatly,  when from beneath a cliff which lay below us a band streamed out. Two  big rams started off to the right. Anastasio and I ran down a bit, and I  tried a long shot at the leading ram. The distance was great, and the  run had pumped me a little. I missed. The second ram was still larger.  He stopped a moment at 150 yards and I dropped him. Anastasio grunted  satisfaction. I swung to the left, where the rest of the band was  journeying, sighted at the shoulder of a young ram and fired. The ball  passed through my intended victim, dropping him, and entered the eye  of a yearling ram who stood behind, thus killing two rams at one shot--a  most unusual accident.    [Illustration: ROCKY MOUNTAIN AND POLO'S SHEEP, DRAWN TO SAME SCALE.]    The rest of the band were now quite distant, and, though I fired several  shots, at Anastasio's desire--he said he wanted a fat ewe--none took  effect.    I cleaned the sheep and skinned out the big head. Anastasio took one  small ram entire on his back, supporting it by a rope passed over the  top of his head, and started down with it, while I followed after with  the big horns. It was 1 o'clock. The head might have weighed thirty-five  pounds fresh. It grew to weigh 1,500 pounds before dark. Stumbling down  through the slide-rock, with legs full of venomous prickers, I passed  below camp without noticing it, and was well on the other side, when I  thought I had gone about far enough, and shouted. J. B.'s voice answered  across a small hill, and I discovered that he had never reached camp at  all, but had found a water spot, and wisely decided not to leave it  without good reason.    I scouted a bit to the west, but found unfamiliar country, and, as the  sun had set, we were seemingly about to stay by that water all night,  when I turned around and saw a pale column of smoke rising above the  crest of the ridge against the evening sky.    At once we marched around the ridge, and, as we rose over the divide, we  saw the whole hillside flaming with signal fires. Our dear old Anastasio  had become alarmed and set fire to fifteen or twenty dead mescals in  different places to guide us home. God bless a good Indian!    With vast content we prepared and ate a luxurious supper. Anastasio,  however, fearing that he might be hungry in the night, impaled all the  ribs of one side of the ram on a pole and planted it in a slanting  position over the fire. Thus he was enabled to put in his time during  his wakeful moments, and face the prospect of a remote breakfast without  discouragement.    The next day, I spent the morning in washing, resting, and cutting  spikes out of my legs. Anastasio packed in the second small ram, and ate  ribs and slept. Then, in the afternoon, we got the rest of the big  fellow down. Anastasio, to make his load lighter, smashed off the shanks  with a stone, although he carried a knife in his belt--a striking trick  of heredity.    And then we talked. \"The Trinidad Valley is not my country,\" said  Anastasio; \"this is my country. Yonder, under that red rock on the  mountain side, about five miles away, there is a spring in the gulch on  the edge of the desert. I was born there, and lived there twenty years  with my father's family. Here where your camp is\"--about twenty feet  square of slide-rock level enough to stand on--\"we sowed crops. We  scraped a hole between the stones with our hands, put in squash seeds,  watered them by carrying water from the spring in our hands and raised  several hills.\"    So he went on, not in so connected a way, but showing, bit by bit, his  manner of life. His tribe, which he called the Kil-ee-ou, must have been  very restricted in numbers at best. His territory was a few leagues of  desert, or almost desert, mountains, every yard of which he knew by  heart, while just over the ridge dwelt the Cocopahs, his mortal enemies.  Sometimes a score of men armed with bows would start a tribal hunt for  deer, though the sheep were beyond their means of attack. Sometimes they  journeyed a few leagues to the Gulf to eat mussels. We could see the  great blue sheet and the leagues of salt incrustations glimmering white  on the hither side, and at one spot on the horizon the blue peak of some  Sonora mountain rose out of the seeming ocean.    But a few deer and mussels and a half dozen hills of squashes could not  fill the abyss of the Indian appetite. The stand-by was roasted mescal.  These plants grow in great numbers in the country adjoining the desert,  and at every season there are some just right for roasting. The Indians  selected these and cooked them for two or three days in a hole in the  ground, by a process called tatema, similar in principle to a clam-bake.  This roasting converts the starchy leaves and heart into a sugary mass,  so that the resulting food is something like a sweet fibrous beet. The  Indian's life really lay in gathering and roasting mescal. And when a  storm prevented the necessary fires, the tribe passed days, often many  days, without food.    So much for Anastasio's early life. A year ago, he told us, he went  hunting with two Americans. One of them came from under the earth, where  there were six months of night, and had passed two seas and been a  month on the train. We supposed, from this, that Anastasio had served as  guide to an Englishman, whose home he described at the Antipodes. The  six months of night were, perhaps, represented by the London fogs, and,  if he passed a month on the train, he must have come by the Southern  Pacific. The Englishman had presented Anastasio with the very  undesirable gaberdine I have before described. Anastasio said that the  Englishman shot quail in the head every time with his rifle, but on  meeting a band of eleven sheep he fired nine shots without hitting.  Anastasio said he trembled, but I incline to think that the Indian had  run him out of breath. Finally the Englishman secured two ewes and a  lamb, after three weeks of hunting.    Look at my fortune! A single day on the mountain, and three rams to show  for it; one with horns that are an abiding splendor--sixteen inches  around the base and forty-two inches on the outer sweep.    I thought at first that the horns made more than one complete spiral,  but, on leveling them carefully, I saw that the entire curve would not  be complete without the points, which were smashed off. In this  connection it is only fair to consider that I carried my lucky bear's  head belt, and invariably sacrificed to the Sun, as several ragged  garments, hung on spikes and branches, may still testify.    The weather threatened storm. J. B.'s leg would not permit him to hunt.  Anastasio was full of meat, eating roasted ribs night and day, beside  his regular meals, and we decided to retreat.    I noticed that the sheep hides had little of the under wool that the  Northern sheep have in December, nor were the animals fat, though the  flesh was sweet and tender, and the livers had their desired medicinal  effect.    Anastasio said it was customary to hunt in summer, when the sheep were  fat, and were compelled to resort to the water holes. Aside from the  meanness of taking advantage of the animals' necessities, the summer is  a bad season for hunting, both because the flesh is rank and spoils  quickly, and the heat and insects are intolerable.    We packed our mules in a gentle rain, and Anastasio made a great bundle  of rejected meat for his own use. To get rope, he slightly roasted the  leaves of the Spanish dagger, tore the"]]]
