I SHALL not insist upon such motives as might be drawn from principles  of oeconomy, and are applicable to particulars only: I reason upon  more general topics. And therefore to the qualities of the head, which  I have just enumerated, I cannot but add those of the heart;  affectionate loyalty to the king, a zeal for liberty and the  constitution, a sense of real honour, and well grounded principles of  religion; as necessary to form a truly valuable English lawyer, a  Hyde, a Hale, or a Talbot. And, whatever the ignorance of some, or  unkindness of others, may have heretofore untruly suggested,  experience will warrant us to affirm, that these endowments of loyalty  and public spirit, of honour and religion, are no where to be found in  more high perfection than in the two universities of this kingdom.    BEFORE I conclude, it may perhaps be expected, that I lay before you a  short and general account of the method I propose to follow, in  endeavouring to execute the trust you have been pleased to repose in  my hands. And in these solemn lectures, which are ordained to be read  at the entrance of every term, (more perhaps to do public honour to  this laudable institution, than for the private instruction of  individuals[p]) I presume it will best answer the intent of our  benefactor and the expectation of this learned body, if I attempt to  illustrate at times such detached titles of the law, as are the most  easy to be understood, and most capable of historical or critical  ornament. But in reading the complete course, which is annually  consigned to my care, a more regular method will be necessary; and,  till a better is proposed, I shall take the liberty to follow the  same that I have already submitted to the public[q]. To fill up and  finish that outline with propriety and correctness, and to render the  whole intelligible to the uninformed minds of beginners, (whom we are  too apt to suppose acquainted with terms and ideas, which they never  had opportunity to learn) this must be my ardent endeavour, though by  no means my promise to accomplish. You will permit me however very  briefly to describe, rather what I conceive an academical expounder of  the laws should do, than what I have ever known to be done.    [Footnote p: See Lowth's _Oratio Crewiana_, p. 365.]    [Footnote q: The Analysis of the laws of England, first published,  _A.D._ 1756, and exhibiting the order and principal divisions of the  ensuing COMMENTARIES; which were originally submitted to the  university in a private course of lectures, _A.D._ 1753.]    HE should consider his course as a general map of the law, marking out  the shape of the country, it's connexions and boundaries, it's greater  divisions and principal cities: it is not his business to describe  minutely the subordinate limits, or to fix the longitude and latitude  of every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged, like  that of the readers in Fortescue's inns of chancery, \"in tracing out  the originals and as it were the elements of the law.\" For if, as  Justinian[r] has observed, the tender understanding of the student be  loaded at the first with a multitude and variety of matter, it will  either occasion him to desert his studies, or will carry him heavily  through them, with much labour, delay, and despondence. These  originals should be traced to their fountains, as well as our distance  will permit; to the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by  Caesar and Tacitus; to the codes of the northern nations on the  continent, and more especially to those of our own Saxon princes; to  the rules of the Roman law, either left here in the days of Papinian,  or imported by Vacarius and his followers; but, above all, to that  inexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning, the feodal  law, or, as Spelman[s] has entitled it, the law of nations in our  western orb. These primary rules and fundamental principles should be  weighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature, and the  practice of other countries; should be explained by reasons,  illustrated by examples, and confirmed by undoubted authorities; their  history should be deduced, their changes and revolutions observed, and  it should be shewn how far they are connected with, or have at any  time been affected by, the civil transactions of the kingdom.    [Footnote r: _Incipientibus nobis exponere jura populi Romani, ita  videntur tradi posse commodissime, si primo levi ac simplici via  singula tradantur: Alioqui, si statim ab initio rudem adhuc & infirmum  animum studiosi multitudine ac varietate rerum oneravimus, duorum  alterum, aut desertorem studiorum efficiemus, aut cum magno labore,  saepe etiam cum diffidentia (quae plerumque juvenes avertit) serius ad  id perducemus, ad quod leviore via ductus, sine magno labore & sine  ulla diffidentia maturius perduci potuisset._ _Inst._ 1. 1. 2.]    [Footnote s: Of Parliaments. 57.]    A PLAN of this nature, if executed with care and ability, cannot fail  of administring a most useful and rational entertainment to students  of all ranks and professions; and yet it must be confessed that the  study of the laws is not merely a matter of amusement: for as a very  judicious writer[t] has observed upon a similar occasion, the learner  \"will be considerably disappointed if he looks for entertainment  without the expence of attention.\" An attention, however, not greater  than is usually bestowed in mastering the rudiments of other sciences,  or sometimes in pursuing a favorite recreation or exercise. And this  attention is not equally necessary to be exerted by every student upon  every occasion. Some branches of the law, as the formal process of  civil suits, and the subtile distinctions incident to landed property,  which are the most difficult to be thoroughly understood, are the  least worth the pains of understanding, except to such gentlemen as  intend to pursue the profession. To others I may venture to apply,  with a slight alteration, the words of sir John Fortescue[u], when  first his royal pupil determines to engage in this study. \"It will not  be necessary for a gentleman, as such, to examine with a close  application the critical niceties of the law. It will fully be  sufficient, and he may well enough be denominated a lawyer, if under  the instruction of a master he traces up the principles and grounds of  the law, even to their original elements. Therefore in a very short  period, and with very little labour, he may be sufficiently informed  in the laws of his country, if he will but apply his mind in good  earnest to receive and apprehend them. For, though such knowlege as is  necessary for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of  twenty years, yet with a genius of tolerable perspicacity, that  knowlege which is fit for a person of birth or condition may be  learned in a single year, without neglecting his other improvements.\"    [Footnote t: Dr Taylor's preface to Elem. of civil law.]    [Footnote u: _Tibi, princeps, necesse non erit mysteria legis Angliae  longo disciplinatu rimare. Sufficiet tibi,--_et fatis _denominari  legista mereberis, si legum principia & causas, usque ad elementa,  discipuli more indagaveris.--Quare tu, princeps serenissime, parvo  tempore, parva industria, sufficienter eris in legibus regni Angliae  eruditus, dummodo ad ejus apprehensionem tu conferas animum  tuum.--Nosco namque ingenii tui perspicacitatem, quo audacter  pronuntio quod in legibus illis (licet earum peritia, qualis judicibus  necessaria est, vix viginti annorum lucubrationibus acquiratur) tu  doctrinam principi congruam in anno uno sufficienter nancisceris; nec  interim militarem disciplinam, ad quam tam ardenter anhelas, negliges;  sed ea, recreationis loco, etiam anno illo tu ad libitum perfrueris._  _c._ 8.]    TO the few therefore (the very few, I am persuaded,) that entertain  such unworthy notions of an university, as to suppose it intended for  mere dissipation of thought; to such as mean only to while away the  aukward interval from childhood to twenty one, between the restraints  of the school and the licentiousness of politer life, in a calm middle  state of mental and of moral inactivity; to these Mr Viner gives no  invitation to an entertainment which they never can relish. But to the  long and illustrious train of noble and ingenuous youth, who are not  more distinguished among us by their birth and possessions, than by  the regularity of their conduct and their thirst after useful  knowlege, to these our benefactor has consecrated the fruits of a long  and laborious life, worn out in the duties of his calling; and will  joyfully reflect (if such reflexions can be now the employment of his  thoughts) that he could not more effectually have benefited posterity,  or contributed to the service of the public, than by founding an  institution which may instruct the rising generation in the wisdom of  our civil polity, and inform them with a desire to be still better  acquainted with the laws and constitution of their country.          SECTION THE SECOND.    OF THE NATURE OF LAWS IN GENERAL.      LAW, in it's most general and comprehensive sense, signifies a rule of  action; and is applied indiscriminately to all kinds of action,  whether animate, or inanimate, rational or irrational. Thus we say,  the laws of motion, of gravitation, of optics, or mechanics, as well  as the laws of nature and of nations. And it is that rule of action,  which is prescribed by some superior, and which the inferior is bound  to obey.    THUS when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter  out of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from  which it can never depart, and without which it would cease to be.  When he put that matter into motion,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#9)"],[1,"or less haphazard, with but little supervision by  any person resembling the broker usually connected with household  industries. The weaver on completing a mat sells it in the market  or to some storekeeper. Up to the present time, the chief trade in  these mats has been at Antipolo in May during the \"romeria\" or annual  pilgrimage to the shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo. Certain persons  in Tanay have made it a practice to gather up a store of mats and  take them to Antipolo for sale there during the fiesta. A few of them  are on sale in Manila and in neighboring provinces. Of late, however,  persons have appeared who are taking up the industry more thoroughly  as brokers and it is to be hoped that the workers will be organized  into some better system for production than now exists. There is a  large opportunity not only for supervision but also for division of  labor. At present the men of the house cut the leaves, and each weaver  (all the weavers are women) carries out the rest of the process. There  would be a considerable saving of time if certain persons devoted  themselves to the preparation of the gray straw, and the dyeing were  left entirely to certain other workers. In this way the weavers of the  mats would be engaged only in the actual fabrication of the article  and much time would be saved to them. [13]    Planting, maturing, and yield of sabutan.--The plants from which the  straw mats at Tanay are made are set out in plots near the houses of  the workers. The suckers are planted in April at the beginning of the  rainy season, and, while it is always stated that straw prepared from  the leaves grown in the shade is best for weaving, yet the plants are  never intentionally set out in the shade but are planted wherever an  unoccupied plot of ground is obtainable. As a matter of fact, the  patches to be seen in the sabutan towns grow in a semi-shade such  as one would expect to find in yards where the usual ornamental and  fruit trees and banana plants grow. Much of the sabutan is in the  sun from morning to night; some is shaded during all or part of the  day. The suckers mature leaves in the third year [14] but these are  cut off and thrown away as useless and it is not until the fourth  year that the lower leaves can be stripped into straw. Harvest takes  place every four months, five or six leaves being obtained from a  plant at each cutting. The plants are never irrigated but it is to  be noted that the soil around Laguna de Bay is very moist and that  the water table is close to the surface with a good seepage from the  hills which are near the shore. It is probable that the plants differ  in their production of leaves because some have many more branches  than others and the climatic and soil conditions affect the yield.    Preparation of the straw.--The best straw is prepared during the  dry season, because at this time there is sufficient sunshine to  produce a good colored material. As a consequence the workers prepare  a large quantity at that season and store it in or under their houses,  wrapped in mats.    The leaves used are about 2 meters in length and 6 cm. in width. The  central thorns on the back of the leaves are removed by cutting away  the midrib. Two lengths about an inch in width are thus produced from  which the outer rows of thorns may or may not be removed, according  to custom. The lengths thus obtained are left in the sunshine and  wind for about half a day to render them more flexible, after which  they are cut into straws. For this purpose there is used an instrument  consisting of a narrow wooden handle about 2 1/2 cm. wide at the base,  into which narrow sharp teeth, usually of steel, are set. Brass and  even hard woods can be used for teeth. The point of the segment being  cut off, the base is grasped in one hand, the inside of the segment  being turned toward the operator. The comb-like instrument is forced  into it about 4 cm. from the end of the base and the teeth are held  against the first finger by pressure of the thumb. The leaf length  is then drawn up by the other hand and is cut into straws depending  in width upon the fineness of the comb used. If the leaves are too  young they will break in this process. The stripped segments are then  usually tied up into bundles as large around as the fist, and hung in  some shaded place exposed to the wind. The length of time occupied by  this process varies. In some places it is omitted, though it seems  to be always carried out in Tanay. The bundles are then undone and  the worker, holding the uncut base of each length in one hand, runs  the straw between his fingers and the sharp edged ruler-like piece  of bamboo held in the other. This is done several times and results  in the removal of considerable moisture, the prevention of wrinkling,  and greater pliability of the straw.    There are several variations in the processes followed for boiling  sabutan. In the Province of Laguna a fistful of the stripped lengths  with bases still attached are rolled up into a bundle and placed in  fresh water in order to remove the coloring matter--in some places  in clear, running river water, in other places in a can of clean,  fresh water--for about twenty-four hours; the water is changed  several times. In the last method the process is discontinued when  the water remains clear. Bundles are then placed in cold vinegar,  water or lemon water to which green tamarind fruit has been added to  make the color of the straw lighter and to toughen it; the water is  brought to a boil. Bamboo is used as fuel, as that fire is not so hot  as a wood fire. The length of time required for cooking differs. One  good authority states that it should be stopped when the odor of  sabutan can no longer be detected in the vapor, which occurs after  about fifteen minutes boiling. This authority also states that the  straw should be removed when it takes on a reddish hue. Many women  put the straw into clear boiling water to which nothing has been  added. After this process the straw is allowed to cool, is washed  several times in clean, fresh water and is spread in the sun to dry,  whereupon it assumes a gray color. If there is no sun the cool straw  must be kept in fresh water which is changed every twelve hours until  the sun appears. If a greenish shade is obtained the process has not  been correctly carried out. Straw from dark green, thick, old leaves,  or from those grown in the sun, is often reddish brown in color.    The boiling processes noted are those used in the preparation of  straw for mats. The process followed in Tanay has been described  by Mr. Amado Simpoco, principal of the Tanay Central School. The  stripped lengths, after being wilted and drawn over the sharp edged  piece of bamboo, are made up into fist bundles, tied at the middle  and placed in a large copper pot 61 cm. in diameter and 84 cm. in  depth and containing about 25 bundles. The pot is filled with water  and the sabutan is boiled for 24 hours, care being taken that the  straw is always covered. After boiling, the bundles are removed and  untied and the strips are hung in the shade or in the house to cool;  afterwards they are placed in the river for a day and are then washed  carefully and dried thoroughly in the sun. The gray straw thus obtained  is stored in bundles, still attached to the uncut bases, and is left  in the air for three or four nights before it is woven into mats.    Dyeing sabutan.--Mr. Simpoco has also made a careful study of the  methods used in Tanay in dyeing sabutan straw, and the results of  his efforts are presented here.    Red orange: For the production of red orange straw the gray material,  prepared as outlined above, is first treated by steeping in water  containing kolis leaves and twigs. The leaves and chopped twigs are  pounded in a mortar and are placed together with the sabutan in a  large receptacle capable of containing from 25 to 30 bundles, filled  with water. The material is allowed to remain in the receptacle for  four days. Early in the morning of the fifth day the straw is removed  and hung in a shaded place until dry and is made up into bundles tied  tightly at the larger end.    The dye fluid is carefully prepared. Chips of sappan are boiled  in a large copper pot for one day. A quantity of turmeric roots  and annatto seeds are pounded separately in mortars until they are  reduced to a very fine state. These are then separately treated with  water and pressed, the result being a turmeric water and an annatto  water. These two are mixed and poured into the boiling sappan. After  about 25 minutes the bundles of sabutan are placed in the pot and the  whole is allowed to boil until every part of the fiber is uniformly  colored. After having been boiled sufficiently, the bundles are removed  and placed in a large basket, later to be dried in the shade. They are  left in the night air for three or four nights and are then rolled up  in coarse mats. The shades procured vary with the proportions of the  dye materials used. Some are a decided orange, others are light yellow.    Yellow: Yellow straw is produced in the same manner, using turmeric  and annatto only.    Red: In the production of red straw the bundles are treated with kolis  leaves in the same manner as in the preliminary process for red-orange  straw. In a pot capable of holding 25 fist bundles of sabutan, four  gantas [15] of finely chopped sappan are placed. Over this are placed  15 bundles of the straw, which in turn is covered with one ganta of  chopped sappan. The remaining 10 bundles are then added and covered  with still another ganta of sappan. The pot is filled with water  and set over a fire for from twelve to fifteen hours. Care is taken  that the bundles are always kept under the water and that all parts  of the material are uniformly colored. The loss by evaporation is  counterbalanced by adding water from time to time. When well colored,  the"]]]
