Stranded Specimens    Stranded blue whales can be readily identified by 1) the large body size  (to 85 feet [25.9 m]); 2) the broad flat head; 3) the all-black baleen  plates (270-395 in number), which are usually barely more than twice as  long as they are wide; and 4) the 55-88 ventral grooves extending to the  navel or beyond (Table 2).    Depending on the state of decay and the position of the stranded  specimen, any of the body characteristics described for living animals  may also be used to positively identify the specimen.

Description    Fin whales have been reported to reach 79 feet (24 m). Females are  slightly larger than males of the same age.    The back is distinctly ridged towards the tail, prompting the common  name \"razorback\" whale.    The rostrum is narrower and more V-shaped than that of the blue whale  and has the same sort of single distinctive head ridge. The top of the  head is flat, though slightly less than that of the blue whale.    The dorsal fin is up to 24 inches (61 cm) tall; angled less than 40 deg. on  the forward margin, located slightly more than one-third forward from  the tail, and appears on the surface shortly after the blow.    All individuals are dark gray to brownish black on the back and sides  with none of the mottling present on blue whales and are rarely as  heavily scarred as sei whales. Along the back, just behind the head,  there is a grayish-white chevron, with the apex along the midline of the  back and the arms of the chevron oriented posteriorly, which is  sometimes distinctive and may be visible as the animals surface to  breathe. The undersides, including the undersides of the flukes and  flippers, are white. On the head, the dark coloration is markedly  asymmetrical, reaching farther down on the left than on the right side.  The right lower lip, including the mouth cavity, and the right front  baleen (approximately one-fifth to one-third) are yellowish white.  Occasionally the right upper lip is also white. The remainder of the  plates on the right side and all those on the left side are striped with  alternate bands of yellowish white and bluish gray. The fringes of the  plates are brownish gray to grayish white.      Natural History Notes    Fin whales are one of the most common baleen whale species in the world  and constitute a major portion of the whaling catch. They are reportedly  one of the fastest of the big whales (sei whales may be slightly faster)  possibly reaching burst speeds in excess of 20 knots, and were not an  important commercial species until the comparatively recent development  of fast catcher boats and the depletion of blue whale stocks.    A fin whale's blow can be from 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 m) tall and has  been described as an inverted cone or an elongated ellipse.    Fin whales dive to at least 755 feet (230.1 m). This depth is probably  deeper than that of either blue or sei whales, a factor usually  reflected in differences among the surfacing, blowing, and diving  characteristics of these three species. When they are moving leisurely  at the surface, fin whales expose the dorsal fin shortly after the  appearance of the blowholes, slightly later than that of the sei whales.  When they are surfacing from a deeper dive, however, they surface at a  steeper angle, blow, submerge the blowholes, and then arch the back and  dorsal fin high into the air before beginning another long dive. In this  species it can be generally stated that the maximum amount of the back  in the area of the dorsal fin which is exposed above the surface as the  animal sounds is approximately 2 times the height of the dorsal fin. Fin  whales do not show their tail flukes when beginning a dive.    Unlike blue or sei whales, fin whales do breach on occasion. When they  do leap clear of the water, fin whales usually reenter with a resounding  splash, like that made by humpback and right whales and not smoothly,  head first, as minke whales often do.    Fin whales are sometimes found singly or in pairs but more often occur  in pods of six or seven individuals and many pods consisting of as many  as 50 animals may be concentrated in a small area.    Fin whales calve and breed in winter, mostly in temperate waters.    Atlantic fin whales eat a wide variety of foods, including krill,  capelin, squid, herring, and lanternfish.      May Be Confused With    Fin whales may be confused with blue whales, sei whales, and, in the  southernmost portion of their range, with Bryde's whales. They may be  distinguished from the blue whales by differences in overall coloration,  coloration and shape of the head, and the size, position, and time of  appearance of the dorsal fin at the surface (see p. 19). After close  examination they may be distinguished from Bryde's whales by the  presence of three ridges along the head (of the Bryde's whale) and by  the smaller, more sharply pointed falcate dorsal fin of the Bryde's  whale (see Fig. 31). They may be distinguished from sei whales in the  following similar ways:              FIN WHALE                           SEI WHALE                                  DORSAL FIN      Slightly falcate, forms angle       Sharply pointed and falcate:    of less than 40 deg. with back          forms angle of greater than    slightly more than one-third        40 deg. with back well more than    forward from tail.                  one-third forward from tail.

The dorsum is irregularly pustulate.    D.--31 specimens: Dorsum variably streaked with cream-color or pale tan  and brown; usually a broad cream-colored stripe from eyelid to groin  bordered laterally by a somewhat narrower brown stripe; middorsal area  cream-color and separated from dorsolateral cream-colored stripe by a  brown stripe, or middorsal area brown with a cream-colored or yellow,  narrow stripe from tip of snout to vent; a dark stripe from tympanum to  flank; dorsal surfaces of heels creamy white to pale orange; anal patch  brown. A dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump; another  ridge extends posteromedially from the eyelid; scattered pustules on the  dorsum in some specimens.    E.--17 specimens: A narrow dark stripe from snout, through nostril and  eye, over tympanum, to vent, enclosing a unicolor dorsum (reddish tan to  yellowish tan in life); heels pale tan or yellow above; anal patch  black. A faint dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump, or  part way to rump.    F.--2 specimens: Mottled brown and cream-color above; upper lips and  upper arms white. A dermal fold from posterior edge of eyelid to rump;  scattered pustules on dorsum.    Some of these color variants are assignable to names proposed by Taylor:  \"A\" and \"B\" undoubtedly are _M. pygmaeus_ (Taylor, 1936a); \"C\" probably  is _M. pygmaeus_; \"D\" is referable to _M. minimus_ (Taylor, 1940d) in  most characteristics, although the coloration is more nearly like that  of _M. lineatissimus_ (Taylor, 1941a), a larger species characterized by  a relatively long hind limb; \"E\" apparently is _M. imitator_ (Taylor,  1942b); \"F\" is _M. albolabris_ (Taylor, 1940d). Examination of series of  these frogs from other parts of Mexico shows a similar composition of  color variants. Of 78 specimens from the Rio Sarabia and the village of  Sarabia in Oaxaca (UMMZ 115428-37), 57 are \"A,\" six are \"D,\" three are  \"E,\" and 12 are \"F\"; of 22 specimens from Teapa, Tabasco (UMMZ 113829),  11 are \"A,\" five are \"D,\" two are \"E,\" and four are \"F\"; of 33 specimens  from Potrero Viejo, Veracruz (USNM 115447-58, 115461-71, 116840-2,  116864-70), ten are \"A,\" 13 are \"E,\" and ten are \"F\"; of 31 specimens  from La Esperanza, Chiapas (USNM 115477-9, 116827-39, 116849-63), 28 are  \"A\" and four are \"F.\"    It is highly doubtful if these color variants are actually distinct  species. Goin (1950 and 1954) in his studies of inheritance of color  pattern in West Indian species of the genus _Eleutherodactylus_ has  shown that similar color pattern variants come from the same clutch of  eggs; furthermore, Goin has worked out the genetic ratios of certain of  these variants. Heathwole (_in litt._) obtained \"normal\" specimens and  individuals having a broad middorsal stripe (\"C\" in figure 9) from a  clutch of eggs of _Eleutherodactylus gollmeri_. The presence of a broad  middorsal yellow stripe is common in _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_.    Perhaps the most interesting aspect of variability in color pattern in  Mexican eleutherodactylids is the parallelism between members of the  _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_-group and some members of  _Microbatrachylus_. In the former group there are white-lipped  individuals (_Eleutherodactylus beatae_ Boulenger), individuals having a  unicolor reddish or yellowish dorsum (_E. dorsoconcolor_ Taylor), and  individuals having a dorsal pattern of irregular longitudinal brown and  cream-colored streaks (_E. venustus_ Guenther). In the humid forests of  southern Veracruz, northern Oaxaca, and Chiapas members of both groups  occur sympatrically. A proper understanding of the evolutionary  significance of these variants in the two groups, as well as proper  allocation of the presently recognized species, must await experimental  evidence based on studies of the inheritance of color pattern.  Nevertheless, at present it is apparent that certain characters,  especially the nature of the dermal folds and pustules, and the color  pattern, are of little taxonomic value in distinguishing \"species\" of  _Microbatrachylus_. The data derived from a study of the large series  from Arteaga, together with that from the other series examined,  suggests that _Microbatrachylus albolabris_, _imitator_, _minimus_, and  _pygmaeus_ are morphotypes of one species. Of these names, _pygmaeus_ is  the oldest. Consequently _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ has been used here  for the series from Arteaga.    Although _Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi_, a species distinguished from  all of the above by the presence of tubercles on the outer edge of the  tarsus, is known from Michoacan northward into Nayarit,  _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ previously has not been known north of  Guerrero, where it occurs in habitats similar to that in which it was  collected at Arteaga.      ~Eleutherodactylus augusti cactorum~ Taylor         _Eleutherodactylus cactorum_ Taylor, Univ.

The specimens from Cheran and Uruapan were  obtained in pine forests; the specimen from Coalcoman was found on a  rocky hillside covered with dense forest and located about 100 meters  below the lower limits of the pine forest in the area. A specimen from  Rancho Reparto (elevation 1850 meters) on the west slope of Cerro  Barolosa was lost.    The specimen from Coalcoman (UMMZ 104728) is a juvenile having a  snout-vent length of 25.0 mm. In life it was tan above, mottled with  olive-green. The ventral surfaces were gray; the hind limbs were  distinctly barred with yellow and brown, and the lips were barred with  yellow and black.      ~Eleutherodactylus occidentalis~ Taylor         _Eleutherodactylus occidentalis_ Taylor, Proc.

SW of       Coire (3); La Placita (7); Los Reyes; Ostula (4); Pomaro       (2).    The locality records for this species suggest that it is a member of a  group of animals, the distribution of which includes the western part of  the Mexican Plateau and the Pacific lowlands. In Michoacan this frog  has been collected in pine-oak forest at Cascada Tzararacua and at Los  Reyes, in arid scrub forest at Arteaga and Coalcoman, and in tropical  semi-deciduous forest on the lower Pacific slopes of the Sierra de  Coalcoman. On July 5, 1950, James Peters (1954:6) found calling males at  La Placita.    Most of the specimens are immature; four adult males have snout-vent  lengths of 30.9-33.0 (32.2) mm. In all specimens the first finger is  noticeably longer than the second; the inner metatarsal tubercle is  large, flat, and cream-colored, contrasting with the dark brown sole of  the foot. When the hind limbs are adpressed, the heels broadly overlap.  Characteristically, a dark line extends from the snout, through the eye,  above the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of the forelimb.  Usually there is a dark bar behind the tympanum, two dark brown bars  from the eye to the mouth and thence onto the lower jaw, and another  dark bar on the upper lip between the eye and nostril. One adult from  Arteaga, an adult and a juvenile from La Placita, and one juvenile each  from Coire, Ostula, and Pomaro, have the lower lip barred with dark  brown and white, and have a white stripe extending the length of the  upper lip. In life the dorsum varies from dark gray or olive-brown to  tan or reddish brown.    This species belongs to a group containing two other populations that  are currently recognized as species--_calcitrans_, known only from  Omiltemi, Guerrero, and _mexicanus_, reported from the mountains of  Oaxaca. Another apparently undescribed member of this group has been  collected in the mountains of northern Puebla. The locality records  indicate that the group inhabits the mountains on the periphery of the  Mexican Plateau, except in western Mexico, where _Eleutherodactylus  occidentalis_ extends to the Pacific lowlands.      ~Eleutherodactylus rugulosus vocalis~ Taylor         _Eleutherodactylus vocalis_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       26:401, November 27, 1940.--Hacienda El Sabino, Michoacan,       Mexico.         Arteaga (10); El Sabino (8); Salitre de Estopilas (3);       Tumbiscatio (2); Tzitzio (2).    The distributional data on this frog in Michoacan indicate that it  inhabits riparian situations in arroyos and canyons in the lower slopes  of the Cordillera Volcanica and the Sierra de Coalcoman, where it has  been taken at elevations only below 1100 meters.    The dorsal color of living individuals from Arteaga varied from dark  gray and olive brown to tan and reddish brown. The iris was grayish  brown. In contrast, individuals from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, had pale  golden eyes; specimens from Matias Romero, Oaxaca, had gold eyes heavily  flecked with gray; and individuals from Volcan San Martin, Veracruz, had  bronze eyes.    The use of the trinomial here is arbitrary. Frogs of the  _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ group in Mexico (_rugulosus_, _avocalis_,  and _vocalis_) exhibit only slight differences in size, proportions, and  coloration (Duellman, 1958c:6). Furthermore, the named populations are  allopatric. _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus vocalis_, as defined by  Duellman (_loc. cit._), occurs in the foothills of the Sierra Madre  Occidental and associated ranges from central Sinaloa southward into  Michoacan.      ~Tomodactylus angustidigitorum~ Taylor         _Tomadactylus angustidigitorum_ Taylor, Univ.
