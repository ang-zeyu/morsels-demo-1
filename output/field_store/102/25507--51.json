Perchance they do, but then they certainly can't believe that  this particular degree or mode of motion which they called _life_ was  eternal. So, then, a degree of motion is life, and a degree of motion is  not life. This thing of confounding life with motion I'm thinking leads  to difficulty. I can see how motion may be the result of life, but just  how it is _life itself_ I can't see quite so well. Is cause and effect  the same?    We have a most remarkable, and yet a natural, concession made in the way  in which men who feel the weakness of their cause generally make  concessions. It is a statement said to be made by Baron Liebig; it is  this: \"Geological investigations have established the fact of a  beginning of life (?) upon the earth, which leaves no doubt that it can  only have arisen naturally and from inorganic forces, and _it is  perfectly indifferent whether or not we observe such a process now_.\"  This statement is untrue as respects geological facts. But the  concession is, that spontaneous generation is not to be an observed  fact. \"Perfectly indifferent whether or not we observe such a process  now?\" Well, it never was observed. Mr. Liebig's statement doubtless  proceeds from the conviction that the system is never to be established  by observation. It is simple imagination. Virchow says: \"We can _only  imagine_ that at certain periods of the development of the earth unusual  conditions existed, under which the elements entering into new  combinations acquired in statu nascente vital motions, so that the usual  mechanical conditions were transformed into vital conditions.\" In this  statement it is well for us to remember that it is not only simple  imagination, but also that vital motions were the cause, bringing about  vital conditions, that is to say, life, before life was, transformed  mechanical conditions into vital conditions. So, in this very singular  imaginary hypothesis touching the origin of life we have the usual  circle suicide of the system. \"Vital motions transform mechanical  conditions into vital conditions,\" and vital conditions fill the world  with \"vital motions,\" and life itself is only a degree \"or mode of  motion.\" _Such_ is their travel around the circle.          *      *      *      *      *    Can you believe that _vital motion_ transformed mechanical conditions  into _vital conditions_, without _life_ being the cause of those _vital  motions_?          DIFFICULTY WITH FIRE.      La Place, in his solution of how our planet was made, supposed that the  cooling, and consequently contracting rings of the fire cloud planet,  earth, did not break up into pieces, but retained their continuity; but,  in opposition to all experience and reason, he supposed that the cooling  rings kept contracting and widening out at the same time. According to  the nebular hypothesis--_or guess_--the fire mist was cooling and  shrinking up, while the rings of the same heat and material were cooling  _faster_ and widening out from it: a piece of disorder equal to a  miracle, for it can not be duplicated among solids or fluids in heaven  or earth, or under the earth; for everything narrows down upon  cooling--_contracts_!          *      *      *      *      *    THE INFIDEL'S OFFSET.--An unbeliever once said to a man who advocated  the doctrine of total depravity: \"The ground for my rejection of all  responsibility for belief is the acknowledged necessitated nature of  belief. Show me,\" said he, \"that it is not necessitated, and I am  answered. When you show me that it is controlled by a will, equally  necessitated, I am not answered. If a necessitated faculty or operation  can not be responsible, then neither will nor volition can be  responsible. You,\" said the infidel, \"go through the whole circle of  mental faculties, and find necessity everywhere and responsibility  nowhere.\"          *      *      *      *      *    Through the kindness of Brother J. M. Mathes we are in possession of a  copy of the life of Brother Elijah Goodwin. It has the merit of being  mainly Brother Goodwin's own production. His many friends will regard it  as a grand \"keepsake.\" It is neatly bound in cloth, contains 314 pages,  and is in beautiful type. Send $1.50 by postoffice order to Elder J. M.  Mathes, Bedford, Lawrence county, Indiana, and receive a copy in return.      Transcriber's Note    The punctuation and spelling from the original text have been faithfully  preserved.
