Born in an age and  country abounding in individual greatness, this man has been handed down  to us by those who best knew both him and the age, as the most virtuous  man in it; while _we_ know him as the head and prototype of all  subsequent teachers of virtue, the source equally of the lofty  inspiration of Plato and the judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, \"_i  maestri di color che sanno_,\" the two headsprings of ethical as of all  other philosophy. This acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers  who have since lived--whose fame, still growing after more than two  thousand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names which  make his native city illustrious--was put to death by his countrymen,  after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality. Impiety, in  denying the gods recognised by the State; indeed his accuser asserted  (see the \"Apologia\") that he believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in  being, by his doctrines and instructions, a \"corruptor of youth.\" Of  these charges the tribunal, there is every ground for believing,  honestly found him guilty, and condemned the man who probably of all  then born had deserved best of mankind, to be put to death as a  criminal.    To pass from this to the only other instance of judicial iniquity, the  mention of which, after the condemnation of Socrates, would not be an  anticlimax: the event which took place on Calvary rather more than  eighteen hundred years ago. The man who left on the memory of those who  witnessed his life and conversation, such an impression of his moral  grandeur, that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to him as  the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death, as what? As a  blasphemer. Men did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mistook  him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as that  prodigy of impiety, which they themselves are now held to be, for their  treatment of him. The feelings with which mankind now regard these  lamentable transactions, especially the later of the two, render them  extremely unjust in their judgment of the unhappy actors. These were, to  all appearance, not bad men--not worse than men commonly are, but rather  the contrary; men who possessed in a full, or somewhat more than a full  measure, the religious, moral, and patriotic feelings of their time and  people: the very kind of men who, in all times, our own included, have  every chance of passing through life blameless and respected. The  high-priest who rent his garments when the words were pronounced, which,  according to all the ideas of his country, constituted the blackest  guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his horror and  indignation, as the generality of respectable and pious men now are in  the religious and moral sentiments they profess; and most of those who  now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his time, and been born  Jews, would have acted precisely as he did. Orthodox Christians who are  tempted to think that those who stoned to death the first martyrs must  have been worse men than they themselves are, ought to remember that one  of those persecutors was Saint Paul.    Let us add one more example, the most striking of all, if the  impressiveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him  who falls into it. If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for  thinking himself the best and most enlightened among his cotemporaries,  it was the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole  civilised world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished  justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, the  tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were all  on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical  product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ  at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ. This man, a  better Christian in all but the dogmatic sense of the word, than almost  any of the ostensibly Christian sovereigns who have since reigned,  persecuted Christianity. Placed at the summit of all the previous  attainments of humanity, with an open, unfettered intellect, and a  character which led him of himself to embody in his moral writings the  Christian ideal, he yet failed to see that Christianity was to be a good  and not an evil to the world, with his duties to which he was so deeply  penetrated. Existing society he knew to be in a deplorable state. But  such as it was, he saw, or thought he saw, that it was held together,  and prevented from being worse, by belief and reverence of the received  divinities. As a ruler of mankind, he deemed it his duty not to suffer  society to fall in pieces; and saw not how, if its existing ties were  removed, any others could be formed which could again knit it together.  The new religion openly aimed at dissolving these ties: unless,  therefore, it was his duty to adopt that religion, it seemed to be his  duty to put it down. Inasmuch then as the theology of Christianity did  not appear to him true or of divine origin; inasmuch as this strange  history of a crucified God was not credible to him, and a system which  purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him so wholly  unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovating agency  which, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gentlest  and most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn sense of  duty, authorised the persecution of Christianity. To my mind this is one  of the most tragical facts in all history. It is a bitter thought, how  different a thing the Christianity of the world might have been, if the  Christian faith had been adopted as the religion of the empire under the  auspices of Marcus Aurelius instead of those of Constantine. But it  would be equally unjust to him and false to truth, to deny, that no one  plea which can be urged for punishing anti-Christian teaching, was  wanting to Marcus Aurelius for punishing, as he did, the propagation of  Christianity. No Christian more firmly believes that Atheism is false,  and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aurelius believed  the same things of Christianity; he who, of all men then living, might  have been thought the most capable of appreciating it. Unless any one  who approves of punishment for the promulgation of opinions, flatters  himself that he is a wiser and better man than Marcus Aurelius--more  deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated in his intellect  above it--more earnest in his search for truth, or more single-minded in  his devotion to it when found;--let him abstain from that assumption of  the joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the great  Antoninus made with so unfortunate a result.    Aware of the impossibility of defending the use of punishment for  restraining irreligious opinions, by any argument which will not justify  Marcus Antoninus, the enemies of religious freedom, when hard pressed,  occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with Dr. Johnson, that  the persecutors of Christianity were in the right; that persecution is  an ordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes  successfully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against  truth, though sometimes beneficially effective against mischievous  errors. This is a form of the argument for religious intolerance,  sufficiently remarkable not to be passed without notice.    A theory which maintains that truth may justifiably be persecuted  because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be charged  with being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but we  cannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whom  mankind are indebted for them. To discover to the world something which  deeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove to  it that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or  spiritual interest, is as important a service as a human being can  render to his fellow-creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the  early Christians and of the Reformers, those who think with Dr. Johnson  believe it to have been the most precious gift which could be bestowed  on mankind. That the authors of such splendid benefits should be  requited by martyrdom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as  the vilest of criminals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error  and misfortune, for which humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes,  but the normal and justifiable state of things. The propounder of a new  truth, according to this doctrine, should stand, as stood, in the  legislation of the Locrians, the proposer of a new law, with a halter  round his neck, to be instantly tightened if the public assembly did  not, on hearing his reasons, then and there adopt his proposition.  People who defend this mode of treating benefactors, cannot be supposed  to set much value on the benefit; and I believe this view of the subject  is mostly confined to the sort of persons who think that new truths may  have been desirable once, but that we have had enough of them now.    But, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution, is  one of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another  till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes.  History teems with instances of truth put down by persecution. If not  suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only  of religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times  before Luther, and was put down. Arnold of Brescia was put down. Fra  Dolcino was put down. Savonarola was put down. The Albigeois were put"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#9)"],[1,"about the same.      SIXTEENTH CENTURY. ELIZABETH. FEMALE.    The costly splendour of attire is well known in Elizabeth's reign, which  began with the same form of hair and head-dress as with Mary, the hat  being set rather higher on the hair. The ruffs, which were imported  already starched from Holland, assumed larger proportions and  complications when the methods of starching became known in England  about 1564. Stow describes ruffs growing to a quarter of a yard deep;  these were no doubt supported by piccalilloes, though they are not  actually mentioned till after 1600, but they surely came with the  fan-shaped structures of these later days. White, red, blue or purple  colours were used in the starching, and yellow in the latter days of  this century. The introduction of this curved fanlike collar setting  became a grand and complicated feature right into the 17th century.  \"Make up\" became very apparent on the faces at this time, for  Bishop Hall censured the fashion in a choice sermon, saying, \"Hear this,  ye plaster-faced Jezabels! God will one day wash them with fire and  brimstone.\"    [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Elizabethan modes.]    [Illustration: Plate XII.--        (_a_) Lady's Outdoor Costume. 1785-95.      (_b_) Costume. Early 18th Century.

An outer opened sleeve was now  favoured, caught in front at the elbow and hanging to the knee over a  fairly tight undersleeve with a turned-back lace cuff or ruffle. With  this came the high-set fan ruff on its wooden support at the back of the  neck, and consequently a higher coiffure.    [Illustration: FIG. 56.    Nos. 1, 2, 3, 1540-50, and other shoe forms worn in the reign of  Elizabeth.]    The same character of skirt continued as in the earlier reigns on hoops  at the lower part, but they became much fuller and rounder at the hips  till about 1590, when the full pleated skirt was supported on a  farthingale or hoop which was set with a gathered circle in the same  goffered design as the ruffs at the edge. These reached their extreme  dimensions at the end of this reign, when the sleeves also assumed a  full padded shape and large epaulets also came in. An overdress with a  full pleated back (like the Watteau dress) was in fashion from the  middle of this reign, and we are lucky to possess some specimens in the  Victoria and Albert Museum of which I am able to give the dimensions.  Small looking-glasses were carried, and were also inset on the round  feather fans. Perfumed gloves, elaborately embroidered, were introduced  during this reign. Silk stockings were worn by Elizabeth for the first  time in 1560, and worsted stockings were made in England in 1564.  Corsets of pierced steel are seen in France from the late 16th and 17th  century, and may have been in use here, though wood, cane, and whalebone  were the chief supports. Shoes became narrow and even pointed, while the  heel began to increase to considerable heights. The buskins of Queen  Elizabeth now at Oxford are raised to 3 inches in height by the aid of a  thick sole, and shoes A and B, Fig. 61, are also reported to have  belonged to her. Chopins for heightening the stature were in use on the  Continent, but I believe did not appear here; but very thick corked  soles and high heels were introduced for this purpose.

ELIZABETH. MALE.    In this reign a very neat small-pointed beard was the fashion, the hair  being brushed up as high as possible and often fulled out at the sides,  and a \"chic\" appearance was sought after. A stiff belled top-hat with an  egret at the right side made its first appearance with a curved brim,  also one of a tapered shape with a smallish round brim, and another very  small round hat with a curved brim, a clasp and feather being mostly  worn on the front of each. The brims of all the hats began to enlarge at  the end of the century when the very high crowned wide brimmed hat made  its appearance, sometimes with a peaked top, and beaver is first  mentioned in their make.    Large circular ruffs became all the rage besides the small turned-over  collar. The round doublet with protruding front became tighter at the  waist, the protuberance taking a punchlike pointed form curving to  almost between the legs and sloping sharply up the hips to the back.  This was set with a very short tab or tabs on padded breeches  tightening to the knee, which usually had very small trunks on the upper  part, and large, stuffed trunk hose also appeared. The stockings were  brought over these in a roll above the knee. Up to this time tights were  made of wool, worsted, fine cloth, frieze, and canvas. The slashings,  pleating, and gatherings of the period were of a much neater character,  and punched patterns and pricked materials came into use.    Close-fitting high boots, generally with serrated tops and thick soles  curving into a short heel, are features of this time. The shoe had a  long front decorated with slashings (often caught with jewels), and an  oval toe which became almost pointed in the last years of this century.  A short top-boot rising to the calf was also in use, mostly with a  little fur edge at the top, and these were often pricked with patterns.    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Elizabethan modes.]          CHAPTER VI    THE CHARACTER OF TRIMMINGS THROUGH THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.      JAMES I.    The braiding and small slashing continued of a similar character to the  end of the Elizabethan age. The slashing now began to be treated with a  larger effect and less elaboration, but pricking and punching were still  much used for enriching surfaces. An improved style of design was  evident.    The female bodice was arranged with a long stomacher, often shaped into  curved forms at the point, and this was set with jewels or embroidery,  otherwise the bodice was decorated with braiding and jewels as in  Elizabeth's reign. The full sleeves were embellished with small slashes  (making diamond squares), puffs, or pricked and punched designs. A  turned-up cuff or ruff of pointed lace finished the wrist, braided  epaulets formed a beautiful feature of the effect, and the front of the  underskirt was decorated with a jewelled band or conventional design, as  was also the border of the overskirt. Caps of an interesting curved form  beautifully embroidered in gold and coloured silks are seen, of which I  give patterns; also loose jackets of the same work were in use when not  in full dress.      CHARLES I.    Many beautifully embroidered caps, jerkins, jackets, and shirts are seen  at this period in gold and black or coloured silks. Slashings of this  reign, though in fashion, had commenced to go out; and those retained  were of a large character, mostly from the neck or shoulder to the  breast. The favoured sleeves were cut into straps to the elbow or wrist,  and were often edged with braid, either side meeting together and lining  the forearm, the body being treated in the same way. The open-fronted  sleeve was set with buttons and loops or long braided buttonholes with  frayed or knotted ends, though these were not generally fastened. The  tight undersleeve was often set with gold or silver narrow braids down  the front and back seams, and close lines of small braids horizontally  round the arm, or vertically when the outer sleeve was treated  horizontally, this gave a beautiful counterchanged effect.    Many of the ladies' caps of this time had beautiful gold scrolls, with  flowers and birds embroidered in coloured silks, also loose jackets of  the same were in use. The bodice was banded with braids or lace on the  front and seams, and the stomacher was often of fine embroidery; set  rosettes or bows were placed at the waist. Other finishing effects of  collar or sleeve, and the button and buttonhole decorations were made  important features on both male and female sleeves, and even down the  front of the outer skirt when it was not treated with lace. Red heels to  shoes began to be worn and continued to the end of the 18th century in  marked favour.      THE COMMONWEALTH.    During this short period the character and placing of braiding was the  same as in the latter part of last reign; slashing had almost completely  gone out, except for the treatment of some ladies' sleeves cut into  bands. A very sober effect was assumed in colour schemes, besides a  plainer treatment in decoration, and a deep plain collar or a small  turn-over one was chiefly worn by the men, while the hat of the Puritan  rose to an absurd height, with a wide flat brim.      CHARLES II.    This may be named the period of ribbon trimmings, though braiding was  treated in broad lines on the short jackets and sleeves, and down the  sides of the breeches. A preference is shown for gold and silver lace,  or amongst the elite purfled silk edges; the new mode being a decoration  of groups of ribbon loops placed about the suit or dress. The notable  feature with the female dress was the gathering of drapery by means of  jewelled clasps, and groups of ribbon loops were also used, as with the  male dress. The edges of the materials were sometimes cut into scalloped  or classic forms, and a very simple voluminous character was fashion's  aim.      JAMES II AND WILLIAM AND MARY.    With the later type of long-skirted coat which began in Charles II's  reign, a heavy style of braiding and buttoning came into vogue, all the"]]]
