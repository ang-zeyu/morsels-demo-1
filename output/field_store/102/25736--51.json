So they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon, and  near its upper end they came to a lot of conch shells lying upon the  sandy bottom. A funny-looking crab was sticking his head out from  each of these shells.    \"These are the hermit crabs,\" said one of the mermaids. \"They steal  these shells and live in them so no enemies can attack them.\"    \"Don't they get lonesome?\" asked Trot.    \"Perhaps so, my dear. But they do not seem to mind being lonesome.  They are great cowards, and think if they can but protect their  lives there is nothing else to care for. Unlike the jolly crabs we  have just left, the hermits are cross and unsociable.\"    \"Oh, keep quiet and go away!\" said one of the hermit crabs in a  grumpy voice. \"No one wants mermaids around here.\" Then every crab  withdrew its head into its shell, and our friends saw them no more.    \"They're not very polite,\" observed Trot, following the mermaid as  Merla swam upward into the middle water.    \"I know now why cross people are called 'crabbed,'\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"They've got dispositions jes' like these 'ere hermit crabs.\"    Presently they came upon a small flock of mackerel, and noticed that  the fishes seemed much excited. When they saw the mermaid, they  cried out, \"Oh, Merla! What do you think? Our Flippity has just gone  to glory!\"    \"When?\" asked the mermaid.    \"Just now,\" one replied. \"We were lying in the water, talking  quietly together when a spinning, shining thing came along and our  dear Flippity ate it. Then he went shooting up to the top of the  water and gave a flop and--went to glory! Isn't it splendid, Merla?\"    \"Poor Flippity!\" sighed the mermaid. \"I'm sorry, for he was the  prettiest and nicest mackerel in your whole flock.\"    \"What does it mean?\" asked Trot. \"How did Flippity go to glory?\"    \"Why, he was caught by a hook and pulled out of the water into some  boat,\" Merla explained. \"But these poor stupid creatures do not  understand that, and when one of them is jerked out of the water and  disappears, they have the idea he has gone to glory, which means to  them some unknown but beautiful sea.\"    \"I've often wondered,\" said Trot, \"why fishes are foolish enough to  bite on hooks.\"    \"They must know enough to know they're hooks,\" added Cap'n Bill  musingly.    \"Oh, they do,\" replied Merla. \"I've seen fishes gather around a hook  and look at it carefully for a long time. They all know it is a hook  and that if they bite the bait upon it they will be pulled out of  the water. But they are curious to know what will happen to them  afterward, and think it means happiness instead of death. So finally  one takes the hook and disappears, and the others never know what  becomes of him.\"    \"Why don't you tell 'em the truth?\" asked Trot.    \"Oh, we do. The mermaids have warned them many times, but it does no  good at all. The fish are stupid creatures.\"    \"But I wish I was Flippity,\" said one of the mackerel, staring at  Trot with his big, round eyes. \"He went to glory before I could eat  the hook myself.\"    \"You're lucky,\" answered the child. \"Flippity will be fried in a pan  for someone's dinner. You wouldn't like that, would you?\"    \"Flippity has gone to glory!\" said another, and then they swam away  in haste to tell the news to all they met.    \"I never heard of anything so foolish,\" remarked Trot as she swam  slowly on through the clear, blue water.    \"Yes, it is very foolish and very sad,\" answered Merla. \"But if the  fish were wise, men could not catch them for food, and many poor  people on your earth make their living by fishing.\"    \"It seems wicked to catch such pretty things,\" said the child.    \"I do not think so,\" Merla replied laughingly, \"for they were born  to become food for someone, and men are not the only ones that eat  fishes. Many creatures of the sea feed upon them. They even eat one  another at times. And if none was ever destroyed, they would soon  become so numerous that they would clog the waters of the ocean and  leave no room for the rest of us. So after all, perhaps it is just  as well they are thoughtless and foolish.\"    Presently they came to some round balls that looked much like  balloons in shape and were gaily colored. They floated quietly in  the water, and Trot inquired what they were.    \"Balloonfish,\" answered Merla. \"They are helpless creatures, but  have little spikes all over them so their enemies dare not bite them  for fear of getting pricked.\"    Trot found the balloonfish quite interesting. They had little dots  of eyes and dots for mouths, but she could see no noses, and their  fins and tails were very small.    \"They catch these fish in the South Sea Islands and make lanterns of  'em,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"They first skin 'em and sew the skin up  again to let it dry, and then they put candles inside, and the light  shines through the dried skin.\"    Many other curious sights they saw in the ocean that afternoon, and  both Cap'n Bill and Trot thoroughly enjoyed their glimpse of sea  life. At last Merla said it was time to return to the palace, from  which she claimed they had not at any time been very far distant.  \"We must prepare for dinner, as it will soon begin to grow dark in  the water,\" continued their conductor. So they swam leisurely back  to the groves that surrounded the palaces, and as they entered the  gardens the sun sank, and deep shadows began to form in the ocean  depths.          CHAPTER 8    A BANQUET UNDER WATER      The palaces of the mermaids were all aglow with lights as they  approached them, and Trot was amazed at the sight.    \"Where do the lamps come from?\" she asked their guide wonderingly.    \"They are not lamps, my dear,\" replied Merla, much amused at this  suggestion. \"We use electric lights in our palaces and have done so  for thousands of years--long before the earth people knew of  electric lights.\"    \"But where do you get 'em?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, who was as much  astonished as the girl.    \"From a transparent jellyfish which naturally emits a strong and  beautiful electric light,\" was the answer. \"We have many hundreds of  them in our palaces, as you will presently see.\"    Their way was now lighted by small, phosphorescent creatures  scattered about the sea gardens and which Merla informed them were  hyalaea, or sea glowworms. But their light was dim when compared to  that of the electric jellyfish, which they found placed in clusters  upon the ceilings of all the rooms of the palaces, rendering them  light as day. Trot watched these curious creatures with delight, for  delicately colored lights ran around their bodies in every direction  in a continuous stream, shedding splendid rays throughout the vast  halls.    A group of mermaids met the visitors in the hall of the main palace  and told Merla the queen had instructed them to show the guests to  their rooms as soon as they arrived. So Trot followed two of them  through several passages, after which they swam upward and entered a  circular opening. There were no stairs here, because there was no  need of them, and the little girl soon found herself in an upper  room that was very beautiful indeed.    All the walls were covered with iridescent shells, polished till  they resembled mother-of-pearl, and upon the glass ceiling were  clusters of the brilliant electric jellyfish, rendering the room  bright and cheerful with their radiance. In one corner stood a couch  of white coral, with gossamer draperies hanging around it from the  four high posts. Upon examining it, the child found the couch was  covered with soft, amber sponges, which rendered it very comfortable  to lie upon. In a wardrobe she found several beautiful gossamer  gowns richly embroidered in colored seaweeds, and these Mayre was  told she might wear while she remained the guest of the mermaids.  She also found a toilet table with brushes, combs and other  conveniences, all of which were made of polished tortoise-shell.    Really, the room was more dainty and comfortable than one might  suppose possible in a palace far beneath the surface of the sea, and  Trot was greatly delighted with her new quarters. The mermaid  attendants assisted the child to dress herself in one of the  prettiest robes, which she found to be quite dry and fitted her  comfortably. Then the sea-maids brushed and dressed her hair, and  tied it with ribbons of cherry-red seaweed. Finally they placed  around her neck a string of pearls that would have been priceless  upon the earth, and now the little girl announced she was ready for  supper and had a good appetite.    Cap'n Bill had been given a similar room near Trot, but the old  sailor refused to change his clothes for any others offered him, for  which reason he was ready for supper long before his comrade. \"What  bothers me, mate,\" he said to the little girl as the y swam toward  the great banquet hall where Queen Aquareine awaited them, \"is why  ain't we crushed by the pressin' of the water agin us, bein' as  we're down here in the deep sea.\"    \"How's that, Cap'n? Why should we be crushed?\" she asked.    \"Why, ev'r'body knows that the deeper you go in the sea, the more  the water presses agin you,\" he explained. \"Even the divers in their  steel jackets can't stand it very deep down. An' here we be, miles  from the top o' the water, I s'pect, an' we don't feel crowded a  bit.\"    \"I know why,\" answered the child wisely. \"The water don't touch us,  you see. If it did, it might crush us, but it don't. It's always  held a little way off from our bodies by the magic of the fairy  mermaids.\"    \"True enough, Trot,\" declared the sailor man. \"What an idjut I was  not to think o' that myself!\"    In the royal banquet hall were assembled many of the mermaids,  headed by the lovely queen, and as soon as their earth guests  arrived, Aquareine ordered the meal to be served. The lobsters again  waited upon the table, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#9)"],[1,"Demon  disappeared, leaving the boy alone in the room with his new and  wonderful possessions.          9.  The Second Journey      By this time you will have gained a fair idea of Rob's character.  He  is, in truth, a typical American boy, possessing an average  intelligence not yet regulated by the balance-wheel of experience.  The  mysteries of electricity were so attractive to his eager nature that he  had devoted considerable time and some study to electrical experiment;  but his study was the superficial kind that seeks to master only such  details as may be required at the moment.  Moreover, he was full of  boyish recklessness and irresponsibility and therefore difficult to  impress with the dignity of science and the gravity of human existence.  Life, to him, was a great theater wherein he saw himself the most  interesting if not the most important actor, and so enjoyed the play  with unbounded enthusiasm.    Aside from the extraordinary accident which had forced the Electrical  Demon into this life, Rob may be considered one of those youngsters who  might possibly develop into a brilliant manhood or enter upon an  ordinary, humdrum existence, as Fate should determine.  Just at present  he had no thought beyond the passing hour, nor would he bother himself  by attempting to look ahead or plan for the future.    Yet the importance of his electrical possessions and the stern  injunction of the Demon to use them wisely had rendered the boy more  thoughtful than at any previous time during his brief life, and he  became so preoccupied at the dinner table that his father and mother  cast many anxious looks in his direction.    Of course Rob was anxious to test his newly-acquired powers, and  decided to lose no time in starting upon another journey.  But he said  nothing to any of the family about it, fearing to meet with opposition.    He passed the evening in the sitting-room, in company with his father  and mother and sisters, and even controlled his impatience to the  extent of playing a game of carom with Nell; but he grew so nervous and  impatient at last that his sister gave up the game in disgust and left  him to his own amusement.    At one time he thought of putting on the electric spectacles and seeing  what the real character of each member of his family might be; but a  sudden fear took possession of him that he might regret the act forever  afterward.  They were his nearest and dearest friends on earth, and in  his boyish heart he loved them all and believed in their goodness and  sincerity.  The possibility of finding a bad character mark on any of  their familiar faces made him shudder, and he determined then and there  never to use the spectacles to view the face of a friend or relative.  Had any one, at that moment, been gazing at Rob through the lenses of  the wonderful Character Marker, I am sure a big \"W\" would have been  found upon the boy's forehead.    When the family circle broke up, and all retired for the night, Rob  kissed his parents and sisters with real affection before going to his  own room.  But, on reaching his cozy little chamber, instead of  preparing for bed Rob clothed himself in the Garment of Repulsion.  Then he covered the glittering Garment with his best summer suit of  clothes, which effectually concealed it.    He now looked around to see what else he should take, and thought of an  umbrella, a rain-coat, a book or two to read during the journey, and  several things besides; but he ended by leaving them all behind.    \"I can't be loaded down with so much truck,\" he decided; \"and I'm going  into civilized countries, this time, where I can get anything I need.\"    However, to prevent a recurrence of the mistake he had previously made,  he tore a map of the world and a map of Europe from his geography, and,  folding them up, placed them in his pocket.  He also took a small  compass that had once been a watch-charm, and, finally, the contents of  a small iron bank that opened with a combination lock.  This  represented all his savings, amounting to two dollars and seventeen  cents in dimes, nickles and pennies.    \"It isn't a fortune,\" he thought, as he counted it up, \"but I didn't  need any money the last trip, so perhaps I'll get along somehow.  I  don't like to tackle Dad for more, for he might ask questions and try  to keep me at home.\"    By the time he had finished his preparations and stowed all his  electrical belongings in his various pockets, it was nearly midnight  and the house was quiet.  So Rob stole down stairs in his stocking feet  and noiselessly opened the back door.    It was a beautiful July night and, in addition to the light of the full  moon, the sky was filled with the radiance of countless thousands of  brilliant stars.    After Rob had put on his shoes he unfolded the map, which was plainly  visible by the starlight, and marked the direction he must take to  cross the Atlantic and reach London, his first stopping place.  Then he  consulted his compass, put the indicator of his traveling machine to  the word \"up,\" and shot swiftly into the air.  When he had reached a  sufficient height he placed the indicator to a point north of east and,  with a steady and remarkably swift flight, began his journey.    \"Here goes,\" he remarked, with a sense of exaltation, \"for another week  of adventure!  I wonder what'll happen between now and next Saturday.\"          10.  How Rob Served a Mighty King      The new traveling machine was a distinct improvement over the old one,  for it carried Rob with wonderful speed across the broad Atlantic.    He fell asleep soon after starting, and only wakened when the sun was  high in the heavens.  But he found himself whirling along at a good  rate, with the greenish shimmer of the peaceful ocean waves spread  beneath him far beyond his range of vision.    Being in the track of the ocean steamers it was not long before he  found himself overtaking a magnificent vessel whose decks were crowded  with passengers.  He dropped down some distance, to enable him to see  these people more plainly, and while he hovered near he could hear the  excited exclamations of the passengers, who focused dozens of marine  glasses upon his floating form.  This inspection somewhat embarrassed  him, and having no mind to be stared at he put on additional speed and  soon left the steamer far behind him.    About noon the sky clouded over, and Rob feared a rainstorm was  approaching.  So he rose to a point considerably beyond the clouds,  where the air was thin but remarkably pleasant to inhale and the rays  of the sun were not so hot as when reflected by the surface of the  water.    He could see the dark clouds rolling beneath him like volumes of smoke  from a factory chimney, and knew the earth was catching a severe shower  of rain; yet he congratulated himself on his foresight in not being  burdened with umbrella or raincoat, since his elevated position  rendered him secure from rain-clouds.    But, having cut himself off from the earth, there remained nothing to  see except the clear sky overhead and the tumbling clouds beneath; so  he took from his pocket the Automatic Record of Events, and watched  with breathless interest the incidents occurring in different parts of  the world.  A big battle was being fought in the Philippines, and so  fiercely was it contested that Rob watched its progress for hours, with  rapt attention.  Finally a brave rally by the Americans sent their foes  to the cover of the woods, where they scattered in every direction,  only to form again in a deep valley hidden by high hills.    \"If only I was there,\" thought Rob, \"I could show that captain where to  find the rebels and capture them.  But I guess the Philippines are  rather out of my way, so our soldiers will never know how near they are  to a complete victory.\"    The boy also found considerable amusement in watching the course of an  insurrection in Venezuela, where opposing armies of well-armed men  preferred to bluster and threaten rather than come to blows.    During the evening he found that an \"important event\" was Madame  Bernhardt's production of a new play, and Rob followed it from  beginning to end with great enjoyment, although he felt a bit guilty at  not having purchased a ticket.    \"But it's a crowded house, anyway,\" he reflected, \"and I'm not taking  up a reserved seat or keeping any one else from seeing the show.  So  where's the harm?  Yet it seems to me if these Records get to be  common, as the Demon wishes, people will all stay at home and see the  shows, and the poor actors 'll starve to death.\"    The thought made him uneasy, and he began, for the first time, to  entertain a doubt of the Demon's wisdom in forcing such devices upon  humanity.    The clouds had now passed away and the moon sent her rays to turn the  edges of the waves into glistening showers of jewels.    Rob closed the lid of the wonderful Record of Events and soon fell into  a deep sleep that held him unconscious for many hours.    When he awoke he gave a start of surprise, for beneath him was land.  How long it was since he had left the ocean behind him he could not  guess, but his first thought was to set the indicator of the traveling  machine to zero and to hover over the country until he could determine  where he was.    This was no easy matter.  He saw green fields, lakes, groves and  villages; but these might exist in any country.  Being still at a great  elevation he descended gradually until he was about twenty feet from  the surface of the earth, where he paused near the edge of a small  village.    At once a crowd of excited people assembled, shouting to one another  and pointing towards him in wonder.  In order to be prepared for  emergencies Rob had taken the electric tube from his pocket, and now,  as he examined the dress and features of the people below, the tube  suddenly slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground, where one end  stuck"]]]
