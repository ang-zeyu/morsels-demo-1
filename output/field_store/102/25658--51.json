When the old woman saw Keejeepaa, she began to dance, and shout, and  carry on, just as she did when he killed Neeoka Mkoo, and taking up  his foot she kissed it; but Keejeepaa said: \"Old lady, let me alone;  the one to be made much of is this my master, Sultan Daaraaee. Kiss  his feet; he has the first honors whenever he is present.\"    The old woman excused herself for not knowing the master, and  then Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle went around on a tour of  inspection. The sultan ordered all the prisoners to be released,  the horses to be sent out to pasture, all the rooms to be swept,  the furniture to be dusted, and, in the meantime, servants were busy  preparing food. Then every one had apartments assigned to him, and  all were satisfied.    After they had remained there some time, the ladies who had accompanied  the bride expressed a desire to return to their own homes. Keejeepaa  begged them not to hurry away, but after a while they departed, each  loaded with gifts by the gazelle, for whom they had a thousand times  more affection than for his master. Then things settled down to their  regular routine.    One day the gazelle said to the old woman: \"I think the conduct of  my master is very singular. I have done nothing but good for him  all the time I have been with him. I came to this town and braved  many dangers for him, and when all was over I gave everything to  him. Yet he has never asked: 'How did you get this house? How did  you get this town? Who is the owner of this house? Have you rented  all these things, or have they been given you? What has become of  the inhabitants of the place?' I don't understand him. And further:  although I have done nothing but good for him, he has never done one  good thing for me. Nothing here is really his. He never saw such a  house or town as this since the day he was born, and he doesn't own  anything of it. I believe the old folks were right when they said,  'If you want to do any person good, don't do too much; do him a little  harm occasionally, and he'll think more of you.' However, I've done  all I can now, and I'd like to see him make some little return.\"    Next morning the old woman was awakened early by the gazelle calling,  \"Mother! Mother!\" When she went to him she found he was sick in his  stomach, feverish, and all his legs ached.    \"Go,\" said he, \"and tell my master I am very ill.\"    So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting on a  marble couch, covered with a striped silk scarf from India.    \"Well,\" said the master, \"what do you want, old woman?\"    \"Oh, my master,\" cried she, \"Keejeepaa is sick!\"    The mistress started and said: \"Dear me! What is the matter with him?\"    \"All his body pains him. He is sick all over.\"    \"Oh, well,\" said the master, \"what can I do? Go and get some of that  red millet, that is too common for our use, and make him some gruel.\"    \"Gracious!\" exclaimed his wife, staring at him in amazement; \"do you  wish her to feed our friend with stuff that a horse would not eat if  he were ever so hungry? This is not right of you.\"    \"Ah, get out!\" said he, \"you're crazy. We eat rice; isn't red millet  good enough for a gazelle that cost only a dime?\"    \"Oh, but he is no ordinary gazelle. He should be as dear to you as  the apple of your eye. If sand got in your eye it would trouble you.\"    \"You talk too much,\" returned her husband; then, turning to the old  woman, he said, \"Go and do as I told you.\"    So the old woman went downstairs, and when she saw the gazelle,  she began to cry, and say, \"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"    It was a long while before the gazelle could persuade her to tell  him what had passed upstairs, but at last she told him all. When  he had heard it, he said: \"Did he really tell you to make me red  millet gruel?\"    \"Ah,\" cried she, \"do you think I would say such a thing if it were  not so?\"    \"Well,\" said Keejeepaa, \"I believe what the old folks said was  right. However, we'll give him another chance. Go up to him again,  and tell him I am very sick, and that I can't eat that gruel.\"    So she went upstairs, and found the master and mistress sitting by  the window, drinking coffee.    The master, looking around and seeing her, said: \"What's the matter  now, old woman?\"    And she said: \"Master, I am sent by Keejeepaa. He is very sick indeed,  and has not taken the gruel you told me to make for him.\"    \"Oh, bother!\" he exclaimed. \"Hold your tongue, and keep your feet  still, and shut your eyes, and stop your ears with wax; then, if that  gazelle tells you to come up here, say that your legs are stiff; and  if he tells you to listen, say your ears are deaf; and if he tells you  to look, say your sight has failed you; and if he wants you to talk,  tell him your tongue is paralyzed.\"    When the old woman heard these words, she stood and stared, and was  unable to move. As for his wife, her face became sad, and the tears  began to start from her eyes; observing which, her husband said,  sharply, \"What's the matter with you, sultan's daughter?\"    The lady replied, \"A man's madness is his undoing.\"    \"Why do you say that, mistress?\" he inquired.    \"Ah,\" said she, \"I am grieved, my husband, at your treatment of  Keejeepaa. Whenever I say a good word for the gazelle you dislike to  hear it. I pity you that your understanding is gone.\"    \"What do you mean by talking in that manner to me?\" he blustered.    \"Why, advice is a blessing, if properly taken. A husband should  advise with his wife, and a wife with her husband; then they are  both blessed.\"    \"Oh, stop,\" said her husband, impatiently; \"it's evident you've  lost your senses. You should be chained up.\" Then he said to the old  woman: \"Never mind her talk; and as to this gazelle, tell him to stop  bothering me and putting on style, as if he were the sultan. I can't  eat, I can't drink, I can't sleep, because of that gazelle worrying  me with his messages. First, the gazelle is sick; then, the gazelle  doesn't like what he gets to eat. Confound it! If he likes to eat,  let him eat; if he doesn't like to eat, let him die and be out of the  way. My mother is dead, and my father is dead, and I still live and  eat; shall I be put out of my way by a gazelle, that I bought for a  dime, telling me he wants this thing or that thing? Go and tell him  to learn how to behave himself toward his superiors.\"    When the old woman went downstairs, she found the gazelle was bleeding  at the mouth, and in a very bad way. All she could say was, \"My son,  the good you did is all lost; but be patient.\"    And the gazelle wept with the old woman when she told him all that  had passed, and he said, \"Mother, I am dying, not only from sickness,  but from shame and anger at this man's ingratitude.\"    After a while Keejeepaa told the old woman to go and tell the  master that he believed he was dying. When she went upstairs she  found Daaraaee chewing sugar-cane, and she said to him, \"Master,  the gazelle is worse; we think him nearer to dying than getting well.\"    To which he answered: \"Haven't I told you often enough not to  bother me?\"    Then his wife said: \"Oh, husband, won't you go down and see the poor  gazelle? If you don't like to go, let me go and see him. He never  gets a single good thing from you.\"    But he turned to the old woman and said, \"Go and tell that nuisance  of a gazelle to die eleven times if he chooses to.\"    \"Now, husband,\" persisted the lady, \"what has Keejeepaa done to  you? Has he done you any wrong? Such words as yours people use to  their enemies only. Surely the gazelle is not your enemy. All the  people who know him, great and lowly, love him dearly, and they will  think it very wrong of you if you neglect him. Now, do be kind to him,  Sultan Daaraaee.\"    But he only repeated his assertion that she had lost her wits, and  would have nothing further of argument.    So the old woman went down and found the gazelle worse than ever.    In the meantime Sultan Daaraaee's wife managed to give some rice to  a servant to cook for the gazelle, and also sent him a soft shawl to  cover him and a pillow to lie upon. She also sent him a message that  if he wished, she would have her father's best physicians attend him.    All this was too late, however, for just as these good things arrived,  Keejeepaa died.    When the people heard he was dead, they went running around crying  and having an awful time; and when Sultan Daaraaee found out what  all the commotion was about he was very indignant, remarking, \"Why,  you are making as much fuss as if I were dead, and all over a gazelle  that I bought for a dime!\"    But his wife said: \"Husband, it was this gazelle that came to ask  me of my father, it was he who brought me from my father's, and it  was to him I was given by my father. He gave you everything good,  and you do not possess a thing that he did not procure for you. He  did everything he could to help you, and you not only returned him  unkindness, but now he is dead you have ordered people to throw him  into the well. Let us alone, that we may weep.\"    But the gazelle was taken and thrown into the well.    Then the lady wrote a letter telling her father to come to her  directly, and despatched it by trusty messengers; upon the receipt  of which the sultan and his attendants started hurriedly to visit  his daughter.    When they arrived, and heard that the gazelle was dead and had been  thrown into the well, they wept very much; and the sultan, and the  vizir, and the judges, and the rich chief men, all went down into the  well and brought up the body of Keejeepaa, and took it away with them  and buried it.    Now, that night the lady dreamt that she was at home at her father's  house; and when dawn came she awoke and found she was in her own bed  in her own town again.    And her husband dreamed that he was on the dust heap, scratching;  and when he awoke there he was, with both hands full of dust, looking  for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#9)"],[1,"ulsion, from one point to another, is  but confirmation of this view.  The temporal art tries ever to  pass from first to last, which is first.  It yearns for unity.  The dynamic movement of the temporal arts is cyclic, which is  ultimately static, of the nature of equilibrium.  It is only in  the wideness of the sweep that the dynamic repose of poetry and  music differs from the static activity of picture and statue.    Thus the Nature of Beauty is in the relation of means to an end;  the means, the possibilities of stimulation in the motor, visual,  auditory, and purely ideal fields; the end, a moment of perfection,  of self-complete unity of experience, of favorable stimulation  with repose.  Beauty is not perfection; but the beauty of an  object lies in its permanent possibility of creating the perfect  moment.  The experience of this moment, the union of stimulation  and repose, constitutes the unique aesthetic emotion.      III  THE AESTHETIC REPOSE      III  THE AESTHETIC REPOSE    THE popular interest in scientific truth has always had its  hidden spring in a desire for the marvelous.  The search for  the philosopher's stone has done as much for chemistry as the  legend of the elixir of life for exploration and geographical  discovery.  From the excitements of these suggestions of the  occult, the world settled down into a reasonable understanding  of the facts of which they were but the enlarged and grotesque  shadows.    So it has been with physics and physiology, and so also,  preeminently, with the science of mental life.  Mesmerism,  hypnotism, the facts of the alteration, the multiplicity, and  the annihilation of personality have each brought us their  moments of pleasurable terror, and passed thus into the field  of general interest.  But science can accept no broken chains.  For all the thrill of mystery, we may not forget that the  hypnotic state is but highly strung attention,--at the last  turn of the screw,--and that the alternation of personality is  after all no more than the highest power of variability of  mood.  In regard to the annihilation of the sense of personality,  it may be said that no connection with daily experience is at  first apparent.  Scientists, as well as the world at large,  have been inclined to look on the loss of the sense of personality  as pathological; and yet it may be maintained that it is  nevertheless the typical form of those experiences we ourselves  regard as the most valuable.    The loss of personality!  In that dread thought there lies, to  most of us, all the sting of death and the victory of the grave.  It seems, with such a fate in store, that immortality were  futile, and life itself a mockery.  Yet the idea, when dwelt  upon, assumes an aspect of strange familiarity; it is an old  friend, after all.  Can we deny that all our sweetest hours are  those of self-forgetfulness?  The language of emotion, religious,  aesthetic, intellectually creative, testifies clearly to the  fading of the consciousness of self as feeling nears the white  heat.  Not only in the speechless, stark immobility of the  pathological \"case,\" but in all the stages of religious ecstasy,  aesthetic pleasure, and creative inspiration, is to be traced  what we know as the loss of the feeling of self.  Bernard of  Clairvaux dwells on \"that ecstasy of deification in which the  individual disappears in the eternal essence as the drop of  water in a cask of wine.\"  Says Meister Eckhart, \"Thou shalt  sink away from they selfhood, though shalt flow into His self-  possession, the very thought of Thine shall melt into His Mine;\"  and St. Teresa, \"The soul, in thus searching for its God,  feels with a very lively and very sweet pleasure that is is  fainting almost quiet away.\"    Still more striking is the language of aesthetic emotion.  Philosopher and poet have but one expression for the universal  experience.  Says Keats in the \"Ode to a Nightingale:\"--         \"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains          My sense as though of hemlock I had drunk,        Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains          One minute past, and Lethewards had sunk:        'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,          But being too happy in thy happiness.\"    And in Schopenhauer we read that he who contemplates the  beautiful \"forgets even his individuality, his will, and only  continues to exist as the pure subject, the clear mirror of  the object.\"    But not only the religious enthusiast and the worshiper of  beauty \"lose themselves\" in ecstasy.  The \"fine frenzy\" of the  thinker is typical.  From Archimedes, whose life paid the  forfeit of his impersonal absorption; from Socrates, musing in  one spot from dawn to dawn, to Newton and Goethe, there is but  one form of the highest effort to penetrate and to create.  Emerson is right in saying of the genius, \"His greatness  consists in the fullness in which an ecstatic state is realized  in him.\"    The temporary evaporation of the consciousness of one's own  Personality is then decidedly not a pathological experience.  It seems the condition, indeed, and recognized as such in  popular judgment, of the deepest feeling and the highest  achievement.  Perhaps it is the very assumption of this condition  in our daily thoughts that has veiled the psychological problem  it presents.  We opine, easily enough, that great deeds are done  in forgetfulness of self.  But why should we forget ourselves  in doing great deeds?  Why not as well feel in every act its  reverberation on the self,--the renewed assurance that it is  I who can?  Why not, in each aesthetic thrill, awake anew to  the consciousness of myself as ruler in a realm of beauty?  Why  not, in the rush of intellectual production, glory that \"my  mind to me a kingdom is\"?  And yet the facts are otherwise:  in proportion to the intensity and value of the experience is  its approach to the objective, the impersonal, the ecstatic  state.  Then how explain this anomaly?  Why should religious,  aesthetic, and intellectual emotion be accompanied in varying  degrees by the loss of self-consciousness?  Why should the  sense of personality play us so strange a trick as to vanish,  at the moment of seemingly greatest power, in the very shadow  of its own glory?    If now we put the most obvious question, and ask, in explanation  of its escapades, what the true nature of this personality is,  we shall find ourselves quite out of our reckoning on the vast  sea of metaphysics.  To know what personality IS, \"root and all,  and all in all,\" is to \"know what God and man is.\"  Fortunately,  our problem is much more simple.  It is not the personality,  its reality, its meaning, that vanishes; no, nor even the  psychological system of dispositions.  We remain, in such a  moment of ecstasy, as persons, what we were before.  It is the  FEELING of personality that has faded; and to find out in what  this will-o'-the-wisp feeling of personality resides is a task  wholly within the powers of psychological analysis.  Let no one  object that the depth and value of experience seem to disintegrate  under the psychologist's microscope.  The place of the full-orbed  personality in a world of noble ends is not affected by the  possibility that the centre of its conscious crystallization may  be found in a single sensation.    The explanation, then, of this apparent inconsistency--the fading  away of self in the midst of certain most important experiences--  must lie in the nature of the feeling of personality.  What is  that feeling?  On what is it based?  How can it be described?  The difficulties of introspection have led many to deny the  possibility of such self-fixation.  The fleeting moment passes,  and we grasp only an idea or a feeling; the Ego has slipped away  like a drop of mercury under the fingers.  Like the hero of the  German poet, who wanted his queue in front,         \"Then round and round, and out and in,        All day that puzzled sage did spin;        In vain; it mattered not a pin;        The pigtail hung behind him,\"    when I turn round upon myself to catch myself in the act of  thinking, I can never lay hold on anything but a sensation.  I  may peel off, like the leaves of an artichoke, my social self,--  my possessions and positions, my friends, my relatives; my  active self,--my books and implements of work; my clothes; even  my flesh, and sit in my bones, like Sydney Smith,--the I in me  retreating ever to an inner citadel; but I must stop with the  feeling that something moves in there.  That is not what my  self IS, but what the elusive sprite feels like when I have got  my finger on him.  In daily experience, however, it is  unnecessary to proceed to such extremities.  The self, at a  given moment of consciousness, is felt as one group of elements  which form a foreground.  The second group is, we say, before  the attention, and is not at that moment felt as self; while  the first group is vague, undifferentiated, not attended to,  but felt.  Any element in this background can detach itself  and come into the foreground of attention.  I become conscious  at this moment, for instance, of the weight of my shoulders  as they rest on the back of my chair:  that sensation, however,  belongs to my self no more than does the sensation of the  smoothness of the paper on which my hand rests.  I know I am a  self, because I can pass, so to speak, between the foreground  and the background of my consciousness.  It is the feeling of  transition that gives me the negative and positive of my  circuit; and this feeling of transition, hunted to its lair,  reveals itself as nothing more nor less than a motor sensation  felt in the sense organs which adapt themselves to the new  conditions.  I look on that picture and on this, and know that  they are two, because the change in the adaptation of my sense  organs to their objects has been felt.  I close my eyes and  think of near and far, and it is the change"]]]
