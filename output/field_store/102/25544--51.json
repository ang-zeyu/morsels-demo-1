[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#9)"],[1,"three days, was that, in his lusty  eagerness for nourishment, he generally risked the suicide's end by  stumbling forward and plunging his whole face in the milk. His one  notion of a safeguard against this danger was to plant one, or  both, of his tubby fore-legs in the dish, a course which always  brought him rebuke from the Mistress of the Kennels.    Toward the end of the fourth week these lessons in lapping became  real meals, and the milk so consumed was always fortified with a  thickening of some cereal rich in phosphates, besides minute doses  of precipitated phosphate of lime, intended to stiffen the gristly  leg-bones of these heavy pups, and increase bone development. The  foster-mothers had been taking this, and communicating it in their  milk, all along. This was the period in which the maternal feelings  of the foster-mothers were submitted to the most severe strain.  Finn's milk-white teeth, and his toe-nails, too, were sharp as  pins, and used with great strength and vigour. Naturally, he  entertained no unkind feelings for his loving little foster-mother;  but, from sheer ignorance and riotous good living, he gave her a  good deal of pain. Some dog-mothers would have warned him about  this pretty sharply; but not so the little sheep-dog. She never  even growled when, after feeding till he could feed no more, the  insolent grey whelp would pound and paw at her soft dugs, and tug  at them with his sharp teeth in sheer wantonness, till they were a  network of red scars and scratches. The most the gentle, plebeian  little mother would do would be to lie flat, after a while, to  protect her dugs--and that for the puppy's own sake--a movement  which always brought Finn galumphing over her shoulder to bite her  ears and paw her nose, and otherwise seek to provoke breaches of  the peace. A riotous, overbearing, disorderly rascal was Finn at  this stage.    [Illustration]    On the morning which ended Finn's fifth week in the world, all the  pups were solemnly weighed in the kitchen scales, which were  brought into the coach-house for that purpose. The Master stood by  with a note-book, and these are the weights he recorded:--      Fawn bitch  10 3/4 lbs.    Grey bitch  11 1/4 lbs.    Fawn dog  12 lbs. 3 oz.    Finn  14 lbs. 4 oz.    In other words, at the age of five weeks, and while still a  suckling pup, Finn weighed as much as some prize-winning fox  terriers, and that breed when fully developed, in point of size,  though not, of course, shapely or set. After corresponding with  other breeders, the Master was confirmed in his already-expressed  conviction that, thus far, Finn was a maker and breaker of records.    During the week following this weighing Finn was only allowed to  visit his foster-mother once, for half an hour or so, in each day.  But the meals he lapped from a dish, in his own blundering way,  included broth now, as well as milky foods, and he still slept with  the foster at night. During the next week--in fine, dry July  weather--all four puppies were gambolling together in the orchard,  from six in the morning till six at night, and never saw the  foster-mothers till they were tired out with their day-long play  and ready for the night's sleep. The Master and the Mistress took  their own lunch and tea in the orchard at this time, and a table  and chairs were kept under a big oak tree for this purpose. In and  out among the legs of these chairs and the table the Wolfhound pups  played boisterously hour by hour, till fatigue overtook them, with  capricious suddenness, and they would fall asleep in the midst of  some absurd antic and in any odd position that came handy.    Then one of the pups, usually Finn, would open his eyes and yawn,  realize once more how good life was, and plunge forthwith upon his  still sleeping brothers and sisters, tumbling them triumphantly  into the midst of a new romp before they knew whether they were on  their heads or their heels. A twig, a leaf, or a stone would be  endowed with the attributes of some cunning and fierce quarry, to  be stalked, run down, and finally torn in sunder with marvellous  heroism, with reckless, noisy valour. The sun shone warm and  sweetly over all, there beside the immemorial Sussex Downs; life  and the dry old earth were very, very good--if only one's breath  did not give out so soon, and one's fore-legs had not so annoying a  trick of doubling up; and then---- What was that rascally fawn pup  rushing for? The Mistress, with the four little dishes and the big  basin? Another meal? Here goes! Bother! I should certainly have  reached her first, if I hadn't turned that somersault over the fawn  pup!    That was how it seemed to Finn, whose life was one long, happy play  and swagger at this time. But there were moments of a kind of  seriousness, too, in which Finn had glimpses of real life. That  very night, or rather late afternoon, Finn discovered that he could  bark, more or less as grown-up dogs bark. True, his first, second,  and third barks proved too much for his unstable equilibrium, and  he rolled over on his side in emitting the noble sounds. But the  fourth time he leaned against the table-leg under the oak tree, and  on that occasion was able to stand proudly to observe the  paralysing effect of his performance upon the others of his family,  who sat round him on their podgy haunches in a respectfully wide  circle, and marvelled fearfully at his robust prowess. They had all  yapped before, but this deep, resonant bark--fully one in three had  no crack in it--this was an achievement indeed. After a while the  grey bitch pup came and tentatively chewed Finn's backbone, with a  vague idea that the sound came from there.    When Finn was escorted--prancing drunkenly--to the coach-house that  evening after his supper, the little sheep-dog within was just  finishing her supper. Finn conceived the notion of showing his  foster-mother what he could do, and accordingly swaggered  unsteadily into the coach-house, delivering loud barks as he  advanced, all up and down the scale. The little sheep-dog (less  than twice Finn's size now) raised her nose from the dish and  barked angrily in good earnest. Finn rolled forward and sniffed in  casual fashion at her dish. Whereupon the foster growled at him  quite ferociously, and shouldered the great whelp out of her way.  The Master, who was looking on, nodded his head once or twice  thoughtfully.    \"Yes,\" he said, as Finn sidled off to the bed rather crestfallen,  \"I think you may take that as your notice to quit, my son; that's  weaning. You've been a good deal on your own lately, you know.  Well, I had meant this for your last night as a baby, anyhow. But  as it is--there, there, little shepherd, you've been a dear, good  little mother, haven't you? Six weeks now; and, as you say, he is a  great hulking chap, isn't he? Well, all right; make it up then, and  give him a good-bye lick. I don't think you've much else to give  now, anyway, but the warmth of your body.\"    But the good, patient little sheep-dog had already placed herself  at the grey whelp's voracious disposal, and he was pounding and  tugging away at her in his usual merciless style. Then, when she  went dutifully to lick the rascal, he thrust at her strongly with  his great strong legs, and the Master, who had been standing,  smoking and watching, said--    \"Come along, little shepherd. That's good-bye.\"    And that was the last Finn saw of any foster-mother. That was the  end of babyhood, and the beginning of childhood for Finn. He slept  alone that night, and found it rather awesome during the few  minutes in which his eyes were open, between the last lapped meal  at ten o'clock and the first of the next day, when the Master came  to him at five-thirty. The Master held that if you would breed a  really exceptional hound, you must be prepared to take really  exceptional trouble over the task, since a chance lost in the first  half year of your hound's life, is lost for good and all.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER V    YOUTH BESIDE THE DOWNS      Finn did not have more than one solitary night for the present. His  great bed in the coach-house, which was twelve feet long by six  feet broad, was shared the next night by the other three puppies,  who had seen the last of their foster-mother that morning. They  whimpered a little after the last night meal, when they found  themselves bereft of maternal attention, and this gave Finn an  opportunity for indulging in a certain amount of swagger on the  strength of his previous night's experience. He had already adopted  the air of a dog accustomed to go his own way and to sleep alone.  Also, he regarded the coach-house bed as his own, and the other  puppies as youngsters only admitted to that place by his courtesy.  Thus from the very outset, here as elsewhere, he gave his comrades  to understand that he was master, and that no one must presume to  trespass upon any quarter which he took up as his own. All day long  the four puppies had the run of the shed in the orchard, which was  kept wide open. If a shower of rain came, they were bustled into  this place by the Mistress of the Kennels, and there the most of  their nine daily meals were served to them.    Nine meals in a day seems a very large number, but this was part of  the Master's theory in the rearing of Irish Wolfhounds, or any  other dog in whom great size is aimed at. In the week after weaning  the meals began at half-past five in the morning and finished at  ten o'clock at night. In the next week they were cut down to eight  meals; the next week seven, the next week six; the next fortnight  five; and then, for a long time, the number of meals served to  these young princes of their breed each day was four. The object in  all this was threefold. First, the Master held it necessary that  these pups should have as much nourishment as they were capable of  assimilating with advantage; secondly, he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#9)"],[1," Fugues of  John Sebastian Bach, found in his _Well-tempered Clavichord_ and in  his mighty works for the organ. The fundamental structure of a fugue  is implied in the term itself (from the Latin \"fuga\"--flight); that  is, in a fugue the main theme or subject is always announced in a  single voice, and the remaining voices, appearing successively in  accordance with definite principles of key-relationship, seem to chase  each other about and to flee from pursuit. The several stratified  entrances of the subject are relieved by intermediate passages called  \"Episodes.\" An Episode, as shown by the derivation ([Greek: ipi  hodos], by the way), is something off the beaten path--a digression;  and it is in these episodical portions of a fugue rather than in the  formalistic portions that the genius of the composer shines forth.  This is especially true of Bach, for almost any well-trained musician  can invent a subject which will allow of satisfactory fugal treatment  according to accepted usage; but no one save Bach has ever invented  such free and fanciful episodes--so daring in scope and yet so closely  connected with the main thought. The general effect of a fugue is  _cumulative_: a massing and piling up of voices that lead to a  carefully designed conclusion which, in some of Bach's organ fugues,  is positively overwhelming. A fugue may be called a mighty crescendo,  like the sound of many waters. There is a popular conception, or  rather _mis_conception, that a fugue is a labored, dull or even \"dry\"  form of composition, meant only as an exhibition of pedantic skill,  and quite beyond the reach of ordinary musical appreciation. Nothing  is farther from the truth, as a slight examination of musical  literature will show. For we see that the fugal form has been used to  express well-nigh every form of human emotion, the sublime, the  tragic, the romantic; very often the humorous and the fantastic. When  we recall the irresistible sparkle and dash of Mozart's _Magic Flute  Overture_, of the Overture to the _Bartered Bride_ by Smetana, of the  Finale of Mozart's _Jupiter Symphony_, and of many of the fugues in  the _Well-tempered Clavichord_, it is evident that to call a fugue  \"dry\" is an utter abuse of language. It is true that there are weak,  artificial and dull fugues, where the composer--frankly--had nothing  to say and merely filled out the form; but the same may be said of  every type of composition, _i.e._, among them all are examples  inspired and--less inspired. This, however, is no indictment of the  fugue _per se_, against which the only thing to be said is that it  requires on the part of the listener an exceeding concentration. Some  of the masterpieces of the world being wholly or partially in the  fugal form, it is the duty of those listening to polyphonic music to  train their powers to the same seriousness of attention expected and  freely given in the appreciation of an oration, a drama or a  cathedral. These latter manifestations of artistic expression, to be  sure, are less abstract than the fugue and more closely related to  daily life. Yet no effort is more repaying than the mental and  emotional energy expended in listening to the interweavings of a good  fugue; for, conscious of missing the periodic divisions of the  Folk-song, we have to listen to more than one melody at a time. A  fugue being a composition, as the French say, of \"longue haleine,\"  our attention, in order to follow its structure, must be on the \"qui  vive\" every moment. The fugue, in fact, is an example of the intricate  and yet organic complexity found in all the higher forms of life  itself; and whenever a composer has wished to dwell with emphasis on a  particular theme, he almost invariably resorts to some form of fugal  treatment, strict or free. The most effective media for rendering  fugues are the chorus of mixed voices, the organ (by reason of its  pedal key-board always making the subject in the bass stand out  majestically) and the stringed orchestra which, with the \"bite\" of the  strings, brings out--with peculiar sharpness--the different entrances  of the subject. The student should become familiar with standard  examples in each of these classes and should, above all, seek  opportunity to hear some of the organ fugues of Bach performed on a  really fine instrument. A few well-known fugues are herewith cited in  order to stimulate the student to some investigation of his own. In  all the Oratorios of Handel and in the choral works of Bach, such as  the B minor Mass, may be found magnificent fugues--as free and vital  in their rhythmic swing as the ocean itself. Particular attention  should be called to the fugue in the Messiah \"And by His stripes we  were healed [Transcriber's Note: And with His stripes we are healed].\"  One of the most impressive fugues in modern literature is the a  capella chorus _Urbs Syon Unica_ from H.W. Parker's _Hora Novissima_.  From among the organ works of Bach everyone should know the Fugues in  G minor, in A minor, in D major[38] and the Toccata and Fugue in D  minor. These have all been transcribed for the pianoforte by Liszt and  so are readily available; they are often played at pianoforte recitals  by Paderewski and other virtuosi. In hearing one of these masterpieces  no one can remain unmoved or can fail to reverence the constructive  genius which fashioned such cathedrals in tone. For orchestra we have  the Prelude to Puccini's opera _Madama Butterfly_, and the beginning  of the Prelude to the third act of Wagner's _Mastersingers_. There are  striking fugal passages in Beethoven's Symphonies, _e.g._, the first  movement of the _Heroic Symphony_ and the rollicking Trio of the  Scherzo in the _Fifth Symphony_. In more modern literature there is  the fugal Finale to Arthur Foote's _Suite for Orchestra_ and in  Chadwick's _Vagrom Ballad_ a humorous quotation of the theme from  Bach's _G minor Fugue_ for organ. One of the most superb fugues in  free style is the last movement of Cesar Franck's _Prelude, Choral and  Fugue in B minor_ for Pianoforte. This movement alone would refute  all charges of dullness or dryness brought against the fugue by the  unthinking or the unenlightened. A good fugue, in fact, is so full of  vitality and demands such _active_ comprehension[39] on the part of  the listener that it is not difficult to imagine where the dullness  and dryness are generally found.    [Footnote 38: Whenever Percy Grainger performs this fugue in his own  arrangement for pianoforte, he always electrifies an audience.]    [Footnote 39: It is worthy of observation that, for those who will  listen to them intelligently, fugues do not merely demand such a state  of mind but actually _generate_ it.]    At this point by an analysis of a fugue from the _Well-tempered  Clavichord_, let us explain some of the technical features in fugal  structure. We shall then be in a position to understand the more  subtle devices of fugal treatment and to appreciate more  enthusiastically some additional comments upon Bach's style in  general.      FUGUE IN E-FLAT MAJOR, NO. VII, IN THE FIRST BOOK.    [Music: Subject    Counter-subject    Answer]    This fugue in three voices begins with a graceful subject, announced  in the upper voice. In the third measure this is answered by an  imitation of the subject in the alto; while the opening voice  continues with a contrasting part called the counter-subject.[40] As  the whole subsequent fabric is organically derived from these two  motives, both subject and counter-subject should be played frequently  and so committed to memory. Observe also the contrasts in rhythm and  melodic outline between the subject and counter-subject. In measures  4 and 5 we have a short sequential passage leading, in measure 6, to  the third entry of the subject in the bass. Then after another  sequential passage, which includes an emphatic assertion of the  subject in the soprano (measures 11 and 12), we enter upon a long  episode which leads, at measure 17, to our first objective point of  rest--a cadence in C minor. With the entry, in this measure, of the  subject in the alto we have an interesting example of what is termed  \"shifted rhythm;\" the subject beginning on the third beat instead of  the first, as at the outset. In the middle portion of the fugue we  have two appearances of the subject in the related keys of C minor  (measures 17 and 18) and G minor (measures 20 and 21). Then, following  two very vigorous sequences, a modulatory return is made to the  subject in the home key, and with its normal rhythm at measure 26. A  repetition, in more brilliant form, of one of the previous episodes,  in measures 31 and 32, gives a strong impression of unity; leading in  measures 34 and 35 to a last appearance of the subject, with a  beautiful change in one of the intervals (E-flat-G-flat). The closing  measures establish the main tonality of E-flat major, rendered still  more expressive by the counterpoint associated with the last chord. As  to the general structure of this fugue, it is evidently tripartite,  the first part A presenting the material, the second part B affording  variety by modulating into different keys, and the third part A'  reasserting the material of A and bringing the composition to a  logical close in the home key. (See Supplement Ex. No. 15.)    [Footnote 40: It is left to the teacher to explain to the student the  key-relationship of Subject and Answer, and the difference between  fugues, tonal and real; for as these points have rather more to do  with composition they play but a slight part in listening to a fugue.]    We should now acquaint ourselves with the more subtle devices of fugal  treatment; although but one of these is employed in the fugue just  studied, which is comparatively simple in structure. I. Inversion; the  melodic outline is turned upside down while identity is retained by  means of the rhythm, _e.g._    [Music: BACH: 3rd "]]]
