[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3233"],[0,"In the Heart of Africa (#9)"],[1," a  pilgrimage to Mecca, the \"hadji\" or pilgrim is certain to have purchased  from some religious Faky of the sacred shrine either a few square inches  of cloth, or some such trifle, that belonged to the prophet Mahomet.  This is exhibited to his friends and strangers as a wonderful spell  against some particular malady, and it is handed about and received with  extreme reverence by the assembled crowd. I once formed one of a circle  when a pilgrim returned to his native village. We sat in a considerable  number upon the ground, while he drew from his bosom a leather envelope,  suspended from his neck, from which he produced a piece of extremely  greasy woollen cloth, about three inches square, the original color  of which it would have been impossible to guess. This was a piece of  Mahomet's garment, but what portion he could not say. The pilgrim had  paid largely for this blessed relic, and it was passed round our circle  from hand to hand, after having first been kissed by the proprietor, who  raised it to the crown of his head, which he touched with the cloth,  and then wiped both his eyes. Each person who received it went through  a similar performance, and as ophthalmia and other diseases of the eyes  were extremely prevalent, several of the party had eyes that had not the  brightness of the gazelle's; nevertheless, these were supposed to become  brighter after having been wiped by the holy cloth. How many eyes this  same piece of cloth had wiped, it would be impossible to say, but  such facts are sufficient to prove the danger of holy relics, that are  inoculators of all manner of contagious diseases.    I believe in holy shrines as the pest spots of the world. We generally  have experienced in Western Europe that all violent epidemics arrive  from the East. The great breadth of the Atlantic boundary would  naturally protect us from the West, but infectious disorders, such as  plague, cholera, small-pox, etc., may be generally tracked throughout  their gradations from their original nests. Those nests are in the  East, where the heat of the climate acting upon the filth of semi-savage  communities engenders pestilence.    The holy places of both Christians and Mahometans are the receptacles  for the masses of people of all nations and classes who have arrived  from all points of the compass. The greater number of such people are  of poor estate, and many have toiled on foot from immense distances,  suffering from hunger and fatigue, and bringing with them not only the  diseases of their own remote counties, but arriving in that weak state  that courts the attack of any epidemic. Thus crowded together, with  a scarcity of provisions, a want of water, and no possibility of  cleanliness, with clothes that have been unwashed for weeks or months,  in a camp of dirty pilgrims, without any attempt at drainage, an  accumulation of filth takes place that generates either cholera or  typhus; the latter, in its most malignant form, appears as the  dreaded \"plague.\" Should such an epidemic attack the mass of pilgrims  debilitated by the want of nourishing food, and exhausted by their  fatiguing march, it runs riot like a fire among combustibles, and the  loss of life is terrific. The survivors radiate from this common centre,  upon their return to their respective homes, to which they carry  the seeds of the pestilence to germinate upon new soils in different  countries. Doubtless the clothes of the dead furnish materials for  innumerable holy relics as vestiges of the wardrobe of the Prophet.  These are disseminated by the pilgrims throughout all countries,  pregnant with disease; and, being brought into personal contact with  hosts of true believers, Pandora's box could not be more fatal.    Not only are relics upon a pocket scale conveyed by pilgrims and  reverenced by the Arabs, but the body of any Faky who in lifetime  was considered unusually holy is brought from a great distance to be  interred in some particular spot. In countries where a tree is a rarity,  a plank for a coffin is unknown; thus the reverend Faky, who may have  died of typhus, is wrapped in cloths and packed in a mat. In this form  he is transported, perhaps some hundred miles, slung upon a camel, with  the thermometer above 130 degrees Fah. in the sun, and he is conveyed to  the village that is so fortunate as to be honored with his remains. It  may be readily imagined that with a favorable wind the inhabitants are  warned of his approach some time before his arrival.    Happily, long before we arrived at Sofi, the village had been blessed by  the death of a celebrated Faky, a holy man who would have been described  as a second Isaiah were the annals of the country duly chronicled.  This great \"man of God,\" as he was termed, had departed this life at a  village on the borders of the Nile, about eight days' hard camel-journey  from Sofi; but from some assumed right, mingled no doubt with jobbery,  the inhabitants of Sofi had laid claim to his body, and he had arrived  upon a camel horizontally, and had been buried about fifty yards from  the site of our camp. His grave was beneath a clump of mimosas that  shaded the spot, and formed the most prominent object in the foreground  of our landscape. Thither every Friday the women of the village  congregated, with offerings of a few handfuls of dhurra in small  gourd-shells, which they laid upon the grave, while they ATE THE HOLY  EARTH in small pinches, which they scraped like rabbits, from a hole  they had burrowed toward the venerated corpse. This hole was about two  feet deep from continual scratching, and must have been very near the  Faky.    Although thus reverent in their worship, the Arab's religion is a sort  of adjustable one. The wild boar, for instance, is invariably eaten  by the Arab hunters, although in direct opposition to the rules of the  Koran. I once asked them what their Faky would say if he were aware of  such a transgression. \"Oh!\" they replied, \"we have already asked  his permission, as we are sometimes severely pressed for food in the  jungles. He says, `If you have the KORAN in your hand and NO PIG, you  are forbidden to eat pork; but if you have the PIG in your hand and NO  KORAN, you had better eat what God has given you.'\"        CHAPTER V.    A primitive craft--Stalking the giraffes--My first giraffes--Rare sport  with the finny tribe--Thieving elephants.    For many days, while at Sofi, we saw large herds of giraffes and  antelopes on the opposite side of the river, about two miles distant. On  September 2d a herd of twenty-eight giraffes tempted me at all hazards  to cross the river. So we prepared an impromptu raft. My angarep  (bedstead) was quickly inverted. Six water-skins were inflated, and  lashed, three on either side. A shallow packing-case, lined with tin,  containing my gun, was fastened in the centre of the angarep, and two  towlines were attached to the front part of the raft, by which swimmers  were to draw it across the river. Two men were to hang on behind,  and, if possible, keep it straight in the rapid current. After some  difficulty we arrived at the opposite bank, and scrambled through thick  bushes, upon our hands and knees, to the summit.    For about two miles' breadth on this side of the river the valley was  rough broken ground, full of gullies and ravines sixty or seventy feet  deep, beds of torrents, bare sandstone rocks, bushy crags, fine grassy  knolls, and long strips of mimosa covert, forming a most perfect  locality for shooting.    I had observed by the telescope that the giraffes were standing as usual  upon an elevated position, from whence they could keep a good lookout.  I knew it would be useless to ascend the slope directly, as their long  necks give these animals an advantage similar to that of the man at the  masthead; therefore, although we had the wind in our favor, we should  have been observed. I accordingly determined to make a great circuit  of about five miles, and thus to approach them from above, with the  advantage of the broken ground for stalking. It was the perfection of  uneven country. By clambering up broken cliffs, wading shoulder-deep  through muddy gullies, sliding down the steep ravines, and winding  through narrow bottoms of high grass and mimosas for about two hours, we  at length arrived at the point of the high table-land upon the verge  of which I had first noticed the giraffes with the telescope. Almost  immediately I distinguished the tall neck of one of these splendid  animals about half a mile distant upon my left, a little below the  table-land; it was feeding on the bushes, and I quickly discovered  several others near the leader of the herd. I was not far enough  advanced in the circuit that I had intended to bring me exactly above  them, therefore I turned sharp to my right, intending to make a short  half circle, and to arrive on the leeward side of the herd, as I was now  to windward. This I fortunately completed, but I had marked a thick bush  as my point of cover, and upon arrival I found that the herd had fed  down wind, and that I was within two hundred yards of the great bull  sentinel that, having moved from his former position, was now standing  directly before me.    I lay down quietly behind the bush with my two followers, and anxiously  watched the great leader, momentarily expecting that it would get my  wind. It was shortly joined by two others, and I perceived the heads of  several giraffes lower down the incline, that were now feeding on  their way to the higher ground. The seroot fly was teasing them, and I  remarked that several birds were fluttering about their heads, sometimes  perching upon their noses and catching the fly that attacked their  nostrils, while the giraffes appeared relieved by their attentions.  These birds were of a peculiar species that attacks the domestic  animals, and not only relieves them of vermin, but eats into the flesh  and establishes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32376"],[0,"Notes on Stable Management in India and the Colonies (#9)"],[1,"summer and warmer  in winter than the flat earthen ones that are generally used in Northern  India. Indian stables are almost always divided off into loose boxes, the  partition walls being continued up to the roof. I think they should be  only built high enough to prevent the horses teasing each other over them,  as if continued right up they interfere with the free circulation of the  air. If this cannot be done, on account of the partitions helping to  support the roof, a window should be knocked through in each. In South  Africa stables are usually simply a long shed with a manger running down  the back wall, without any partitions between the standings, and the  horses are simply tied up to a ring in the manger with the head rope. Cape  horses are, however, exceedingly quiet, and will stand still all day long.  They never seem to think of kicking or biting at each other like the  Indian country-bred does.      Chicks.    The plague of flies in the East, particularly during the rains, cannot be  realized in England, and if not protected against them, they will almost  worry horses to death. For this reason the doors and windows of the stable  should be fitted with \"chicks,\" or mats, made out of split bamboos or  reeds, with interspaces between them, which allow of light and air passing  through, but which will keep the flies out. They are not very costly  articles, and add most materially to the comfort of the horse. If  carefully looked after, and not let flap about in the wind, they will last  for years with a very small annual expenditure for repairs.      Stable Floors.    The stable floor should be made of wet clay beaten down, and left to  thoroughly dry. This can be carried out by the \"syces,\" and if thoroughly  done, they will last a good many months. I always make it a practice to  dig up the floors of stables in a new house, before they are occupied, a  foot and a half deep, and thoroughly renew it, and usually it is  astounding the amount of foul earth that has to be removed. I also have  the whole of the floor picked up and renewed once a year--for choice, at  the end of September or beginning of October, after the rains have  stopped. Any moisture should be at once removed, before it has time to  soak into the floor; or, if it has, the moist earth should be swept away  with a broom (jaru), made out of a number of pliable twigs tied together,  and fresh dry earth sprinkled over the top of it. A supply of dry powdered  earth should be kept outside each stable door in a box ready for use when  required. The ordinary earth that is in the compound will not do to make  floors out of, although \"syces\" will use it if allowed, as it is less  trouble to get than clay (kicher ke muttee), but it will not bind, and  when trodden on breaks up and wears into dust.      Charcoal (_khoalie_).    Although it looks dirty, powdered charcoal sprinkled over the floor has a  powerful effect as a deodorizer. The ashes of a wood fire do nearly as  well as charcoal for this purpose, and can be obtained anywhere, as wood  is universally used for fuel all over India. In some stables earthenware  vessels (chatties) are buried under the floor to catch the urine. This is  an abominable, filthy custom, and should never be permitted, as there is  no more certain cause of disease. Diseases of the feet, such as foul  smelling, suppurating frogs, thrush, and canker, are in the majority of  cases caused by horses standing on wet, filthy floors.      Picketing.    In the hot season horses should, if possible, be picketed out at night as  soon as it gets cool in the evening. It is the greatest relief to an  animal to be brought out of a hot stable into the open air, even if the  actual temperature is no less than indoors. If the flies or mosquitos are  troublesome, the nets sold for the purpose will keep them off. If the net  is not sufficient, a fire made out of the stable litter on the windward  side will drive them away, and horses do not mind smoke. It is as well to  have a regular standing made with mud, in the same way as the stable  flooring, as otherwise the ground soon gets broken up and foul. The  standing should be swept clean every morning, and mended in the same way  as the stable floors are.      Bedding (_bechalie_).    There is nothing better than clean straw for bedding, and it is a great  mistake to stint horses in it. If a good deep bed is given, they will lie  down and rest themselves, whereas, if there is not enough, and the floor  feels hard through it, they will walk about over it, and far more will be  wasted than if the horse was lying down on it. The bedding should be taken  up every morning, and any soiled straw removed. It should be well shaken  up and spread out in the sun to dry and air, and at night, when again put  down for use, a small quantity of fresh straw added to it. In wet weather  the bedding can be aired and dried in the verandah. All soiled straw and  droppings should be at once removed in a basket (tokrie), which should be  provided for the purpose; and it is wonderful, if this plan is adopted,  how little fresh straw is required to keep the horse constantly supplied  with a good bed; and nothing is more saving to the wear and tear of the  legs and feet than to get the animal to lie down at night. In Australia  and South Africa wheat or oat straw can be obtained, but in India rice  straw is generally used, or else the long elephant grass that grows on the  banks of rivers and swampy places. Both are good enough for the purpose,  only they are brittle, and more is required than when wheat straw is used,  as they quickly break up.      Sawdust (_burradah_).    In the north of India the deodar, or Himalayan cedar sawdust, can always  be obtained from any of the timber depots on the banks of the large  rivers, almost for the expense of carting it away. It makes a good bed if  straw cannot be obtained, but is liable to stick to the horse and get in  under his coat if at all long, and gives much more work grooming. It is  also more troublesome to remove in the morning to air, and if any wind is  blowing a good deal gets wasted. If used, it is best to have it spread out  in one stall and leave it there, only using it at night, putting the horse  into another during the daytime. Any sawdust that gets damp or soiled  should be at once removed, as it very soon begins to smell badly.      Shavings.    Shavings of deodar or pine can also be obtained, but they require to be  carefully sorted out, as there are likely to be splinters in them, and in  lying down the horse may give himself a bad wound.      Sand (_ret_).    Sand can be obtained anywhere along the banks of the rivers; but it is  hard, and does not form a very yielding bed, and I should not use it if  anything else could be got. It requires to be sifted, to get rid of the  pebbles and stones it contains. If straw is scarce and sand has to be  used, the best plan is to put a layer of about a foot of sand over the  floor, and a thin layer of straw over it; this will make a much softer bed  than the sand alone.      Horses eating Bedding.    This is a trick some horses have, and from which they seldom can be cured.  It is generally the custom to put a muzzle (chik-na) on them at night; but  this, of course, stops their feeding at all. I prefer to bed them down  with sand, sawdust, or shavings, and leave them free to feed at night. If  a muzzle is used, it should be a wire one, not leather, as these get very  foul and dirty, and interfere with the horse's breathing, which the wire  one does not.      Exercise.    In India it is usual to exercise ordinary hacks, polo ponies, and harness  horses, not doing any special work, twice a day--morning and evening. The  length of time they are out, and the amount of ground they cover, is very  variable--in most cases depending on whether the \"syce\" is in a mood to  take exercise or not himself. They usually take horses out on the road to  the bazaar, or some favourite meeting-place; and it is not an uncommon  thing to see a couple of dozen horses, belonging to various people,  standing about, while their respective \"syces\" are sitting about, smoking  and discussing their masters and various bazaar topics of interest. Under  these circumstances the horses do not get much exercise; and many a  mysterious injury, that cannot be accounted for, is inflicted by their  kicking at each other while standing about in this manner. If the compound  is large enough, it is a good plan to make a ring with the stable litter  and have the horses exercised round it. You can then be certain they are  getting a fair amount of work; but a large ring is necessary, and if there  is a garden it spoils the compound. Furthermore, horses get into a very  careless, slovenly way of walking when led round and round in this  monotonous fashion daily. \"Syces\" generally lead horses at exercise, and  most horse-owners will not allow them to ride; but I think this is a  mistake, and if they can ride, I always allow them to do so. If they lead  the horse, he will go along in a listless fashion, and walk with his head  down, stumbling at every step; whereas, if he is ridden, he will carry his  head up and go in a much more lively and collected fashion, and it being  much pleasanter for the \"syce\" to ride than walk, the full amount of  exercise is more likely to be taken. \"Syces\" nearly always ride at  exercise bare-backed; but they should be made use a folded blanket as a  pad, kept in its place by a body-roller, as the anatomy of the native of  India is such that, without any protection, he is likely to give the horse  a sore back. They should also only be let use a snaffle bridle, as few  know how to handle a double one. When at exercise knee-caps should be  worn. These should be bought from a European saddler, and care be taken  that the top strap is fitted with a piece of indiarubber in the middle,  to allow of its giving with the"]]]
