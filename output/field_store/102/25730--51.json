The object is to maintain  a medium temperature, in order to obtain a better gas having the  greatest illuminating power. In about four or five hours the coal in the  retort will have given off all its gas. The mouth of the retort is  opened, and the coke is raked out into large iron vessels, and  extinguished by water. A fresh charge is immediately introduced by means  of a long scoop in the cherry-red retort, and the door luted to. The  ascension pipes, which convey the gas from the retorts, pass straight up  for a few feet, then turn round, forming an arch, then pass downward  into the hydraulic main, beneath the level of the liquid contained in  it, and bubble up through the liquid into the upper portion of the main.  On commencing the main is half filled with water, but after working some  time, this water is displaced by the fluid products of distillation. In  this way, the opening into each retort is closed, so that a charge can  be withdrawn and replaced without interfering with the action of the  other retorts and pipes. The liquid tar, ammoniacal water, and gas pass  from the end, _e_, of the hydraulic main, down through the pipe, P, and  the liquid falls down into the tar well, T W, while the crude gas goes  on into the chest, C, partially filled with the liquid, so that the  plates, _p p_, from the top dip into it to within a few inches of the  bottom. These dip plates are placed in the chest, so as to separate the  openings into each pair of condensing pipes, _c c_, so that the gas  passing into the chest finds no exit except up _c_{1}, and down  _c_{2}; and there being no dip plate between _c_{2} and _c_{3} it  passes up _c_{3}, and down _c_{4}, and as there is no dip plate to  prevent its progress, it passes up _c_{5}, and down _c_{6}, into the  lime or iron purifiers, L I. The condensers are kept cool by exposure to  the atmosphere, and are often cooled by a stream of water from a tank  above. The gas cools quickly, and liquids passing along with the gas in  a state of vapor are condensed and fall into the chest, and pass by an  overflow pipe into the tar well. The purifier is a cast iron vessel, L  I, containing a number of perforated shelves, _s_{1} _s_{1} _s_{1},  on which slaked lime, to the depth of about 4 inches, or much greater  thickness of iron oxide and sawdust, is placed. The gas passes up  through the shelves, _s s s_, and down through the shelves, _s_{1}  _s_{1} _s_{1}, through the pipe, G, into the gas holder, and from  thence through the pipe, M, to the main pipe. The lime abstracts  carbonic anhydride, sulphureted hydrogen, cyanogen, naphthalin, and a  portion of the ammonia, but not carbon disulphide, which latter may be  absorbed by passing the gas through a solution of sodic hydrate and  plumbic oxide, mixed with sawdust. Gas containing CS{2}, on burning,  produces H{2}SO{4}, which injures books and furniture in rooms.  However, the quantity of CS{2} in gas is generally so minute as to be  practically uninjurious. By a proper regulation of the temperature  during distillation, the quantity produced is infinitesimal. When the  lime is saturated it is removed, and fresh supplied; but the iron, after  use, can be reconverted into oxide by exposure to the atmosphere, and  used repeatedly. When iron is used a separate lime purifier is necessary  to remove carbonic anhydride. The last traces of ammonia are removed  before passing to the gas holder, by passing the gas through dilute  sulphuric acid, or up through the interior of a tower having perforated  shelves covered with coke in small pieces, through which a constant  supply of fresh water percolates. This washing removes some of the more  condensable hydrocarbons, and lessens the illuminating power of the gas.  Before the gas passes from the condensers into the purifiers, it passes  through a kind of pump, termed an exhauster, driven by steam power. This  action relieves the retorts from the pressure of the gas passing through  the hydraulic main, etc. It diminishes the deposit of graphite in the  retorts, and lessens leakage in them, should there be any flaws. It also  has the beneficial effect of producing a gas of a higher illuminating  power, since the relief of pressure in the retorts produces a more  favorable condition of combustion.    [Illustration: THE DISTILLATION OF COAL.]    The following are some of the bodies produced in the manufacture of gas,  namely, acetylene, _g_, the carbonate, _s_, chloride, _s_, cyanide, _s_,  sulphide, _s_, and sulphate, _s_, of ammonium; aniline, _t_, anthracene,  _s_, benzine, _l_, carbonic oxide, _g_, carbonic anhydride, _g_,  carbonic disulphide, _l_, chrysene, _s_, cumene, _l_, cymene, _l_,  ethylene, _g_, hydrogen, _g_, leucoline, _l_, methyl-hydride, _g_,  naphthaline, _s_, nitrogen, _g_, paraffine, _s_, phenylic alcohol, _l_,  picoline, _l_, propene, _g_, quartene, _g_, sulphureted hydrogen, _g_,  toluene, _l_, water, _l_, xylene, _l_, etc.    The most of the above solid and liquid substances, with the letters _s_  and _l_ written after, are removed by cooling the gas in the condensers,  and the gaseous substances marked _g_, that are injurious in the  consumption of the gas, are removed by purification. The impurities in  the gas may consist of ammonic carbonate and sulphide, carbonic  anhydride and disulphide, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphureted hydrogen, and  water in the form of vapor; and acetylene, ethylene, and the vapors of  the acetylene, ethylene, and phenylene series of hydrocarbons are the  illuminating ingredients diluted with carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and  methyl-hydride. The approximate percentage composition of coal gas is:  H, 45.6; Me, 34.8; CO, 6.5; C{2}H{4}, 4; CO{2}, 3.6; N, 2.4;  C{4}H{8}, 2.3; SH{2}, 0.3, etc.--_Hugh Clements in English Mechanic._           *       *       *       *       *                              =A Short History of Petroleum.=    The _Lumberman's Gazette_ gives the following short history of  petroleum: The production of petroleum as an article of trade dates from  the 28th of August, 1859, when Colonel Drake, in a well 69-1/2 feet  deep, \"struck oil,\" and coined a phrase that will last as long as the  English language. From that beginning it has increased to an annual  production of 14,500,000 barrels of crude oil. The first export was in  1861, of 27,000 barrels, valued at $1,000,000, and the export of  petroleum in the year 1877 was, in round numbers, $62,000,000. The  annual product of petroleum to-day--crude and refined--is greater in  value than the entire production of iron, and is more than double that  of the anthracite coal of the State of Pennsylvania, and exceeds the  gold and silver product of the whole country. As an article of export it  is fourth, and contests closely for the third rank. Our leading exports  are relatively as follows: Cotton annually from $175,000,000 to  $227,000,000; flour from $69,000,000 to $130,000,000; pork and its  products (bacon, ham and lard) from $57,000,000 to $82,000,000; and  petroleum from $48,000,000 to $62,000,000. The total export of petroleum  from 1861 to and including 1877 (16 years) has been $442,698,968, custom  house valuation. From the best sources of information there are at this  time 10,000 oil wells, producing and drilling, which, at a cost of  $5,000 per well, would make an investment of $50,000,000 in this branch  of the business. Tankage now existing of a capacity of 6,000,000 barrels  cost $2,000,000, and $7,000,000 has been invested in about 2,000 miles  of pipe lines connected with the wells. The entire investment for the  existing oil production, including purchase money of territory, is  something over $100,000,000, which amount cannot be lessened much, if  any, for as wells cease to produce new ones have been constantly drilled  to take their place.           *       *       *       *       *                                  =Minute Forms of Life.=    The Rev. W. H. Dallinger lately delivered a lecture at the Royal  Institution, descriptive of the recent researches of Dr. Drysdale and  himself. The object of the lecture was mainly to explain the method of  research which had been employed. The first essays of the opticians to  produce \"high powers\" were, as might be expected, feeble. These powers  amplified, but did not analyze; hence it began to be questioned whether  \"one could see more really with a high power than with a moderate one.\"  And this was true at the time. But it is not so now. The optician has  risen to the emergency, and provided us with powers of great magnifying  capacity which carry an equivalent capacity for analysis. They open up  structure in a wonderful way when rightly used. The lecturer began by  projecting upon the screen the magnified image of a wasp's sting--an  object about the 1-20th of an inch in natural size--and beside it was  placed a piece of the point of a cambric sewing needle of the same  length, magnified to the same extent. The details of the sting were very  delicate and refined, but the minute needle point became riven and torn  and blunt under the powerful analysis of the lens, showing what the  lecturer meant by \"magnifying power;\" not mere enlargement, but the  bringing out of details infinitely beyond us save through the well made  lens. This was further illustrated by means of the delicate structure of  the _Radiolaria_, and still further by means of a rarely delicate valve  of the diatom known as _N. rhomboides_. With a magnification of 600  diameters no structure of any kind was visible; but by gradually using  1,200, 1,800, and 2,400 diameters, it was made manifest how the ultimate  structure of this organic atom displayed itself.
