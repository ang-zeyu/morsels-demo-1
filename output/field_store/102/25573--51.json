The crista parotica  is visible dorsally along the lateral edge of the bony prooetic. The  squamosal is narrow anteriorly and posteriorly.    The prevomers are short and separated anteriorly by partly ossified  cartilage of the overlying solum nasi. The prevomer is joined to the  premaxillary by cartilage. The posterior margin of the prevomer  articulates directly with the sphenethmoid. The anterolateral and  posterolateral processes of the prevomers form the incomplete bony  internal margin of the choanae. Each prevomer bears three to six teeth.  The palatine is absent. The anterior part of the parasphenoid is narrow  and ends in a point. The pterygoid is slender and weakly developed.    _Natural History._--Throughout its range _Hyla staufferi_ occurs in  subhumid forests and savannas; consequently, the breeding activities  are limited by the seasonal occurrence of rainfall, which accumulates  in temporary ponds where this species breeds. Clasping pairs and gravid  females have been found mostly from June to August throughout its  range. This species was observed calling at Finca Taboga, Guanacaste  Province, Costa Rica, in mid-July. The males were calling from  temporary grassy and weedy ponds in which _Hyla microcephala_ also was  calling, but the two species had different calling sites. _Hyla  staufferi_ called at stations at heights of five to 80 cm. near the  edge of the pond, whereas _Hyla microcephala_ called from emergent  vegetation in the middle of the pond. Charles W. Myers informed me that  at Penonome, Cocle, Panama, he found _staufferi_ calling from grass in  puddles where _microcephala_ was absent, and at El Cano, Cocle, Panama,  _staufferi_ was calling from higher sites (\"several inches to a few  feet above water\") than _microcephala_.    Stuart (1948:34) reported breeding individuals from La Libertad,  Guatemala, after rainfall in late May, and Schmidt and Stuart  (1941:239) reported _staufferi_ breeding in July in the Salama basin,  Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Stuart (1935:38) and Duellman (1960:63 and  1963:226) agreed that this species breeds early in the rainy season.  However, Rand (1957:519) stated that in El Salvador \"these frogs did  not begin to call until almost a month and a half after the beginning  of the rains.\" Blair (1960:133) reported that males call in June and  July in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas, Mexico.    The mating call of this species is a series of closely spaced notes  having a fundamental frequency of about 100 cycles per second. Each  note has a duration of 0.13 to 0.23 second, repeated at intervals that  are longer than the duration of the call. The notes are moderately  low-pitched and have a dominant frequency of more than 3,000 cycles per  second and about 120 pulses per second (Table 2).    _Tadpoles._--Measurements of the 33 tadpoles that are available are  given in Table 8. The largest tadpole examined is in stage 38 and has a  total length of 29.5 mm.    A typical tadpole in stage 38 of development (KU 104162, 5 km ESE  Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico) has a body length of 10 mm., tail length of  19.5 mm., and a total length of 29.5 mm. Other characters are as  follows: body as deep as wide, depressed anteriorly; body as long as  depth of tail; interorbital space greater than distance between eye and  snout but equal to internarial space; nostril equidistant between eye  and tip of snout; distance between spiracle and eye less than distance  between eye and snout; eyes large, situated dorsolaterally; mouth  anteroventral, approximately triangular in outline; one row of papillae  covering lower lip and all except median fourth of upper lip; scattered  papillae at corners of mouth; tooth rows 2/3; first upper row entire,  second row interrupted medially, shorter than first; lower rows shorter  than upper rows; beak weak; spiracle short and nearer eyes than anus;  anal opening not reaching edge of ventral fin; dorsal fin barely  extending onto body; caudal musculature pointed distally.

In preservative, tan and  pinkish-orange coloration lost; body transparent, reticulations on tail  present.    _Remarks._--_Hyla staufferi_ was described by Cope (1865:195) on the  basis of specimens from Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. He described the  color pattern as \"color above dark olive, with a short black bar over  each scapula, and one from eye to eye, with a trace along the coccyx.\"  Cope (1887:14) placed _staufferi_ as a subspecies of _Hyla eximia_, but  he did not justify his action. Guenther (1901:262) also considered  _staufferi_ to be conspecific with _eximia_ without making any  qualifying statement. Dunn and Emlen (1932:24) named _Hyla culex_ from  Tela, Honduras, on the basis of a male (MCZ 16098) having a snout-vent  length of 25.1 mm., and a female (USNM 20267) from Patuca, Honduras.  They diagnosed the species as having \"discs larger than tympanum ...  black interorbital triangle, traces of black dorsal marking; three  black bars on anterior and posterior face of thighs, two black bars on  tibia, on tarsus and on forearm.\" The holotype now is faded but has  some of the pattern described. Dunn and Emlen did not compare _culex_  with _staufferi_ but did compare it with _boulengeri_ and _rubra_.    Dunn (1933:61) named _Hyla altae_ from Summit, Canal Zone. His  description was based on a male (MCZ 17972) having a snout-vent length  of 25.1 mm., the color pattern was described as \"gray with four darker  dorsal stripes ... a faint trace of mid-dorsal striping....\" Dunn  defined the _Hyla rubra_ group and recognized _boulengeri_, _altae_,  _culex_, and _rubra_ as members. _Hyla elaeochroa_ and _staufferi_ were  omitted from his key to the group in Central America.    Kellogg (1932:174) compared _staufferi_ with _eximia_ and concluded  that the two were probably distinct species. Stuart (1935:38)  considered _altae_ to be a synonym of _culex_. Gaige (1936:293)  considered _altae_ and _culex_ to be conspecific but regarded  _staufferi_ as a different species. She also suggested that _staufferi_  was not related to _eximia_ but belonged to the _rubra_ group. Taylor  (1952:865) and Duellman (1966a:274) considered _altae_ and _culex_ to  be synonyms of _staufferi_.    The only other worker besides Cope and Guenther to consider _Hyla  staufferi_ as a member of the _eximia_ group was Blair (1960:129), who  suggested the relationship on the basis of similarities in the  structure of the calls of _eximia_ and _staufferi_. Taylor (1938:421)  and Smith and Taylor (1948:78) excluded _staufferi_ from the _eximia_  group on the basis of morphological characteristics. I consider _culex_  to be inseparable from _staufferi_, whereas _altae_ is recognizable as  a Panamanian subspecies of _staufferi_.      _Hyla staufferi staufferi_ Cope, New Combination        _Hyla staufferi_ Cope, Proc.

(#9)"],[1,"it be expected that he should feel much enthusiasm at sight of a fine  prospect, when his head was aching with the weight of my luggage, and  his feet were sore with the burden they had had so long to support  over flinty, uneven ground. I confessed to myself the justice of this  reflection, and became at last as anxious as he for our arrival at some  city.    A few days after, various things convinced us that we were not far  removed from one. Heaps of rubbish lay strewn confusedly here and there,  which were uncomfortable to look at, and much more uncomfortable to  smell! The road was broader and harder, as if beaten down by many  feet. By-and-by a house or two appeared,--then two together,--then  three,--until at last we saw a whole street, with quantities of little  objects running in and out them. I would willingly have examined what  the animals were who occupied these dwellings, which were indeed  miserable enough. I learnt afterwards that they were inhabited by pigs;  and their huts, that were never too clean or neat, were called in the  language of the country _styes_, but so unpleasant an odour came from  them that I could not be prevailed on to go very near. The town itself  now came in sight, and, as I had never seen any other than Caneville,  my curiosity was aroused as I drew closer to make acquaintance with the  inhabitants, and see if they were at all like either of the tribes of  beasts between which my native place was divided. Snub was no less  delighted at the prospect of getting rid of his load and refreshing his  body upon some more savoury food than he had lately indulged in.    It was not at that time that I knew all the particulars which I  afterwards obtained concerning this foreign city; but I may as well  relate here all that I subsequently gleaned.    The place was called Norsarque, and was inhabited by animals of every  sort and size, who lived in houses large, small, middling, high, low,  miserable, and beautiful, just as their means or taste allowed them.  They were not, I found, the richest beasts who occupied the most costly  dwellings; on the contrary, I often discovered some very poor animals  who made a most splendid figure; for, curiously enough, although the  Norsarquians had a very great notion of their own wisdom, they often  believed the greatest nonsense which any creature chose to tell them,  provided the speaker wore a fine coat, and seemed to think a good deal  of himself.    I could write a history of the many funny and contradictory things  I met with in Norsarque; but perhaps nobody would read it if I did, so  I will go on with my own adventures, and only speak of such matters as  particularly concerned myself. I must however mention, as a circumstance  that had afterwards a great deal to do with causing my departure from  the town, that the place was governed by some superior, or thought to be  superior, animal, chosen from among the principal beasts; but that the  inhabitants generally were so discontented and fond of quarrelling,  that they had scarcely elected him King, than they began to find fault  with him and with everything he did, and were not satisfied until they  killed him or drove him away, and set up another in his place. Sometimes  this royal beast was a Pig; sometimes a Lion; once he was a Fox, and,  although very much hated by all his subjects, he managed to make them  quarrel among themselves, and so employ their time as to have no leisure  left to think of him, until one unlucky day, when, having nothing else  to do, they rose up against him and drove him out, and put some other  animal in his place. When I arrived at Norsarque, a Bear was on the  throne; so the Bears were in high favour, and several fresh ones had  lately come to the city to seek their fortunes,--and very rough-looking  beings they were too!    With the aid of Snub, I managed to procure some handsome apartments in  a genteel quarter; and, as I intended to make a long stay in the place,  I procured everything which could make them comfortable.    When once established, I directed some attention to my humble companion.  As I was convinced of his fidelity and his attachment to myself, I  resolved to keep him for my own private servant, and I therefore hired  others to do the necessary work of the house. But as Snub could not  attend me in my walks in the costume he wore when he left his native  place, I procured a complete livery-suit, in the fashion at Norsarque;  and Snub soon looked splendid in a dress of bottle-green, with white  buttons springing out all over his body, just like daisies on a lawn,  and, I assure you, with his hat surrounded with a broad gold band, and  his hair powdered, he looked a very different figure. Having thus cared  for his outer dog, I did what I could to improve his name; and scorning  to remember that he ever bore such a vulgar one as _Snub_, I made him  _Snubbini_ forthwith, and took care always to pronounce every letter  of the word. It was astonishing to observe the effect which these little  matters produced on my neighbours. They took me for a grand Cat at once;  and I overheard a Pussy, who was talking to another on the roof of the  house situated on the opposite side of the street where I lived, that  I was a foreign Princess in disguise, and was rich enough to buy half  Norsarque, if I felt inclined! But how they had learnt _that_ piece of  news, I could not imagine.    I had been residing some months among the restless inhabitants of  Norsarque, when an incident took place, which, although I thought but  little of it at the time, turned out of great importance to me.    I happened to be walking in one of the principal Squares, or _Places_  as they were called, when my ear was attracted by the sound of music.    Although the performers were not of the best, and their time was about  as good as their tune,--that is to say, both indifferent enough,--I  could not help stopping as I went by to see the show.    There were three mongrels, rather fantastically dressed, blowing all the  breath they could spare into two flageolets and a flute, but as one or  the other was forced to stop every now and then to recover his wind, and  always managed to do so in the most pathetic part, the effect was more  curious than agreeable. Several animals were standing round, and a  little wee Pup went about among them collecting, with a hat big enough  to hold a great deal more than was ever put into it. But the creature  who most attracted my attention was a huge lump of a Bear, with so ugly  a face that it made me quite shudder to look at him, who seemed the  master of the band, and held a tray up to the various windows where any  heads had been put out to listen to the music. He was in the act of  doing so, when I came up, to the window of a large house, where a fat,  white Puss, evidently the servant of some rich family, was nursing a  darling little Kitten that was mewing with delight at the scene below.    [Illustration: WANDERING MINSTRELS.]    The servant had thrown down a few coppers in reply to the Bear's demand  for money, when the ill-tempered brute, not satisfied with the donation,  swore in so terrible a way, that the frightened nurse let go her hold of  the Kitten, which fell direct from her paws.    I rushed forward to save it, upsetting as I went the unfortunate little  Pup, who was at that moment presenting the hat for my contribution, and  was just in time to seize it by the tail before it reached the pavement.  At the same instant the door burst open, a troop of servants rushed out,  headed by a Cat, superbly dressed. The band of musicians disappeared,  as if by magic, the great Bear being the first to take to flight; the  new-comers surrounded me, and I had the satisfaction of putting the  Kitten, unharmed, into its mother's paws. A tender scene then ensued;  and as ingratitude was not among this Lady Puss's failings, I was begged  to enter, nay, was almost carried into the house, to receive the  repeated thanks of the noble family.          THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE.      Senor Don Tomas Ricardo, the husband of the Lady Puss whose Kitten  I had been the means of saving, was one of the richest, and perhaps  the noblest, Cats of all our tribe, residing in Norsarque.    He was very indignant when he heard from his Lady how nearly the darling  of his family had been killed through the rudeness of a Bear, and he  curled his whiskers and waved his tail in the excess of his anger.  He did more than this; he went out among his friends, and, calling  together a meeting of Cats, who were very numerous in the city, he made,  as I heard, a speech which produced an immense effect upon them.    He commenced by saying that the Cat tribe was known (among themselves)  to be the most ancient, the most noble, the most virtuous, the most  courageous, and the most clever of all the animals who lived upon the  face of the earth. (This was received with loud mews of satisfaction;  and one enthusiastic Tom called out, \"Cats for ever!\") He then began to  compare our race with other beasts generally, and, saying a good deal in  favour of the Dogs, for a reason which will presently appear, yet still  placing Cats in the first rank of created things, he went on to speak of  Bears. Encouraged by the groans, which the mention of such disagreeable  beasts occasioned, he boldly inveighed against the conduct of _the_ Bear,  then upon the throne; spoke of his favouritism in encouraging into the  city so many of his tribe, and asked the meeting, in an injured tone,  how they would feel when an entire army of these monstrous animals  should march in and live upon the best of the land, while they, the  Cats, would starve for want of the necessaries of life. (Of course  the audience declared they should not like it at all, and uttered the  most discordant cries to prove their assertion, amid which the same  enthusiastic Tom exclaimed, \"Down with the Bears!\") His hearers"]]]
