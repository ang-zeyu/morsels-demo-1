[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#9)"],[1,"attributed to R. Gershom and sometimes  cited under the title of \"Commentaries of the Scholars of  Mayence.\"  Isaac ben Judah - not to be confounded with Isaac ha-  Levi, both having been the disciples of Eliezer the Great-was  scrupulously pious, and absolutely bound by traditional usage.    Rashi, it thus becomes apparent, was not content to learn from  only one master, he attended various schools, as if he had had a  prevision of his future task, to sum up and, as it were,  concentrate all Talmudic teachings and gather the fruits of the  scientific activities of all these academies.  Similarly, Judah  the Saint, before he became the redactor of the Mishnah, placed  himself under a number of learned men, \"as if,\" says Graetz, \"he  had had a presentiment that one day he would collect the most  diverse opinions and put an end to the juridical debates of the  Tannaim.\"    Rashi's intellectual status during these years of study must not  be misunderstood.  Pupil he doubtless was, but such a one as in  course of time entered into discussions with his teachers, and to  whom questions were submitted for decision.  It may even be that  toward the end of his school period, he commenced to compose his  Talmudic commentaries, or, rather, revise the notes of his  masters.    At Worms as at Mayence, his fellow-students probably counted  among their number those young scholars who remained his friends  and correspondents.  Such were Azriel ben Nathan, his kinsman  Eliakim ha-Levi ben Meshullam, of Speyer (born about 1030),  Solomon ben Simson, Nathan ben Machir and his brothers Menahem  and Yakar, Meir ha-Cohen and his son Abraham, Samuel ha-Levi and,  chief of all, his brother David, Nathan ben Jehiel and his  brothers Daniel and Abraham, Joseph ben Judah Ezra, Durbal, and  Meir ben Isaac ben Samuel[19] (about 1060), acting rabbi and  liturgical poet, mentioned by Rashi in terms of praise and  several times cited by him as an authority.  Meir of Rameru,  later the son-in-law of Rashi, also studied at the academies of  Lorraine, though probably not at the same time as Rashi, but a  short while after.    As is natural, it was of his teachers that Rashi preserved the  most faithful recollections, and he refers to them as  authoritative even after he had surpassed them in knowledge and  reputation.  He does not always mention their names in repeating  their opinions.  If it were possible to make a distinction and  decide the authorship of each sentence, it would be found that we  are not far from the truth in asserting that the greater part of  the pupil's work was the work of his masters.[20]    But in literature, as elsewhere, honor does not redound to the  workmen who have gotten the material together, but to the  architect,  wise and skilful [skillful sic], who conceives and  carries out the plan for the entire edifice, and, with the stones  others have brought, constructs a monument of vast proportions.                               CHAPTER III                       RASHI AT TROYES-LAST YEARS    The youth Rashi has now completed his apprenticeship; in his  studies and travels he has amassed a vast store of information,  which he will use for the profit of his contemporaries and of  posterity; and he now believes himself in possession of  sufficient knowledge and experience to strike out for himself.  Moreover, he must now provide for his family-we have seen that he  married while still a student.  But he does not give up his  studies.    His change of abode was the only change in his life, a life of  remarkable unity, the life of a student.  Rashi gave himself up  entirely to study, to study without cessation, and to teaching;  but teaching is only a form of pursuing one's studies and summing  them up.                                    I    Detailed and comprehensive though the Talmudic studies were,  nevertheless the student, especially if he was gifted, completed  the course when he was not much more than twenty years of age.  Rashi, then, was probably close to twenty-five years old when he  returned from Mayence.  This return marks an epoch in the history  of rabbinical literature.  From that time, the study of the  Talmud was cultivated not alone upon the banks of the Rhine, but  also in Champagne, which came to rival and soon supplant  Lorraine, and having freed itself from the subjection of the  Rhenish schools, radiated the light of science.  Jews from all  over Christian Europe gathered there to bask in the warmth of the  new home of Jewish learning.  Less than ten centuries earlier, the  same thing had happened when Rab transplanted the teaching of the  Law from Palestine to Babylonia, and founded an academy at Sura,  which, for a while rivalling [rivaling sic] the Palestinian  schools, soon eclipsed them, and finally became the principal  centre [center sic] of Jewish science.  The Kabbalist was not so  very far from the truth when he believed that the soul of Rab had  passed into the body of Rashi.    It is noteworthy that this upgrowth of Talmudic schools in  Champagne coincides with the literary movement then beginning in  Christian France.  In emerging from the barbarous state of the  early middle ages, it seems that the same breath of life  quickened the two worlds.  The city of Troyes played an especially  important role in matters intellectual and religious.  A number of  large councils were held there, and the ecclesiastical school of  Troyes enjoyed a brilliant reputation, having trained scholars  such as Olbert, Pierre Comestor, Pierre de Celle, and William of  the White Hands.  And it was near Troyes that the mighty voices of  Abelard and Saint Bernard resounded.    There is a curious reminder of Rashi's sojourn at Troyes.  As late  as 1840 an ancient butcher shop was still standing, into which,  it was remarked, flies never entered.  Jewish tradition has it  that the shop was built on the spot previously occupied by  Rashi's dwelling-hence its miraculous immunity.  The same legend  is found among the Christians, but they ascribe the freedom from  flies to the protection of Saint Loup, the patron saint of the  city, who himself worked the miracle.  Rashi is linked with Troyes  in ways more natural as well.  As I have said, certain expressions  occur in his works which he himself says refer to his city.  Some  scholars have even stated that they recognized in the language  he used the dialect of Troyes, a variety of the speech of  Champagne, itself a French patois.    It is probable that Rashi-who was never at the head of the  Talmudic schools of Worms or Prague, as the legends go-exercised  the functions of a rabbi at Troyes, that he never kept himself  exclusively within the confines of his school, 'and that he felt  it his duty to instruct all his fellow-Jews.  In conjunction with  his intellectual endowments, he possessed faith and charity, the  true sources of strength in religious leadership.  He was the  natural champion of the weak,[21] the judge and supervisor of all  acts.  He pronounced judgment in cases more or less distantly  connected with religion, that is, in nearly all cases at a period  so thoroughly religious in character.  Either because he had been  appointed their rabbi by the faithful, or because he enjoyed  great prestige, Rashi was the veritable spiritual chief of the  community, and even exercised influence upon the surrounding  communities.  The man to preside over the religious affairs of the  Jews was chosen not so much for his birth and breeding as for his  scholarship and piety, since the rabbi was expected to  distinguish himself both in learning and in character.  \"He who is  learned, gentle, and modest,\" says the Talmud, \"and who is  beloved of men, he should be judge in his city.\" As will soon be  made clear, Rashi fulfilled this ideal.  His piety and amiability,  in as great a degree as his learning, won for him the admiration  of his contemporaries and of posterity.  At Troyes there was no  room for another at the head of the community.    Like most of the rabbis of the time, Rashi accepted no  compensation from the community for his services, and he probably  lived from what he earned by viticulture.  Once he begs a  correspondent to excuse the shortness of his letter, because he  and his family were busy with the vintage.  \"All the Jews,\" he  said, \"are at this moment engaged in the vineyards.\" In a letter  to his son-in-law Meir, he gives a description of the wine-  presses of Troyes, in the installation of which a change had been  made.  It was deemed fitting that the scholar should provide for  the needs of his family; the law in fact imposed it upon him as a  duty.  \"Religious study not accompanied by work of the hands is  barren and leads to sin.\" The functions of a rabbi were purely  honorific in character, dignifying, and unrelated in kind to'  mercantile goods, for which one receives pay.  It was forbidden to  make the law a means of earning one's living or a title to glory.  \"He who profits by his studies or who studies for his own  interest, compromises his salvation.\"    When the religious representative showed such devotion and  disinterestedness, the pious willingly submitted themselves to  his authority.  The spiritual heads of the communities had as  great ascendency [ascendancy sic] over believing Jews as a king  had over his subjects; they were sovereigns in the realm of the  spirit.  And Rashi in his time, because of his learning and  piety, exercised the most undisputed authority.  His influence  though not so great was comparable, in the sphere in which it  could be exercised, with that of the great Saint Bernard upon the  entire Christian world, or with that of Maimonides upon Judaism  in the Arabic countries.    People in all circumstances and from all the surrounding  countries addressed themselves to him; and to the list of his  correspondents in Lorraine may be added the names of several  French rabbis, the \"wise men\" of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#9)"],[1,"applied, that should remain perfectly  dormant in the unmarried state. After awhile these sensations,  increasing in frequency and influence, serve to prostitute the mind and  the young lady may become ruined for life. I am stating facts that can  be proved by multitudes of living witnesses to-day in cases and  confessions that have come under my own observation. On remonstrating  against this habit, some remark, \"But it feels so nice, doctor!\" Of  course, ablutions of the _external_ organs are perfectly right and  proper and should be resorted to daily. To the reflecting mind no more  need be said about this matter. Those who wish to live in harmony with  the order of their creation and thereby preserve the freshness of  health, will not have recourse to such means as add new derangements to  the system.    To preserve feminine charms as the girl develops into womanhood, much  depends upon her mental state. She must not allow herself to bear malice  towards anyone, must not plot evil or attempt to \"pay off others in  their own coin,\" as it is called, or seek revenge in any way; but she  must ever cultivate a forgiving disposition, good thoughts and good  feelings towards everyone. There is always danger of meeting both rude  and lewd girls, and that too in places where least expected; they may be  found in schools of all kinds and are occasionally met with in the  houses of one's own friends. Not very long since a charming young lady  wrote me from a neighboring city, that while sharing a bed with another  girl, she experienced a very strange sensation induced by the improper  liberties of her bed-fellow; and so persistent were these troublesome  sensations, although occupying a bed by herself ever after, she thought  it proper to seek my advice. Now this was a good and pure-minded girl  who might easily have been ruined but for her inherent love of chastity;  and so our daughters are always in danger of being contaminated. A  perfectly pure and chaste mind, unsullied by impure thoughts or acts,  and cultivated by the exercise of all the Christian virtues, lends  enchantment to the eye, sweetness of expression to the face, music to  the voice, and gracefulness of carriage. Cultivation of merely external  manners will not do; they must spring from the mind and thence they  shine throughout the whole, in every fibre and movement of the body.  Such an one is truly beloved wherever she goes; she has a real affection  for her father and mother, brothers and sisters; and she is fully  prepared to appreciate and love one of the opposite sex whose purity of  life and nobleness of mind fully corresponds to her own.    To retain this charm of excellence will cost her many a trial and her  temptations will be innumerable and very great. But her perceptive  faculties are keen, and at the first suspicion of anything wrong she  must have the moral courage to say: \"No! that is not allowable, it is  not right,\" or, \"this is impure and its tendency is to vice.\" Whatever  the temptation may be, in thought or in deed, let no one persuade her  into wrong-doing--not even her _apparently_ best friend; for it would  only be an appearance of friendship if he tempted to anything of a  vicious nature. She will be beset with hosts of admirers, some of them  pure and having honorable intentions; but (I am sorry to sound the note  of warning here,) others will come with the most dishonorable intentions  possible, though with an air of sincerity, and apparently as artless as  doves. Study all men long and carefully, keeping them meanwhile at a  respectful distance; never allow one to sit near with his arm about your  waist or to hold your hand in his; never allow him to kiss you--_the  vilest of loathsome diseases may be communicated by a kiss_ viz.:  _syphilis_. Do not allow any approach or touch beyond what is customary  in the best of society at a social gathering. Many a young lady with an  angelic form and spotless soul within, full of the best intentions and  of the purest character, giving bright promise of a brilliant future,  has been ruined for life by trusting herself alone with some of these  apparently wise and good, yet really vile men.    Young women have not, as a rule, any sexual propensity, or amorous  thoughts or feelings. If they have been properly educated and cared for,  they are, before marriage, perfect strangers to any such sensations; and  yet any young lady who falls, does so by her own hand and she has no one  else to blame for it. _Remember_ that the Lord, in the beginning, never  suffers temptations beyond one's strength to overcome. If she falls  ultimately, it results from allowing an impure seed to be planted in the  mind at first, which she then nourishes for a time and only in the end  it bears its fruit.    As time passes, a young lady forms an acquaintance with gentlemen, and  at length she favors the addresses of one who is particularly agreeable  to her. After this acquaintance has ripened into love, and she has  become convinced of the purity of his heart, she enjoys being with him,  in sitting by his side, and is unhappy in his absence. When betrothed,  owing to her great and pure love for him, she takes pleasure in  receiving such marks of affection from him as are shown by a tender  father or brother, but nothing more. After marriage, she feels that she  is really his and that he has become a part of herself--that they are no  more twain but are one flesh. All this has transpired without her hardly  suspecting such a quality in herself as an amorous affection. Still she  more than ever loves him, more than ever desires to be near him until  finally their union is fully and truly consummated by the marriage act.  At no time in her life does a woman make a greater sacrifice of her  feelings than at this time, and she does it solely for her pure and  fervent love for him. This is right and proper, and is in accordance  with the laws of order in the creation of the two sexes in the human,  animal and vegetable kingdoms throughout the world.    I wish here to have some \"Plain Talk,\" that the true object of this book  may be more fully understood and its mission more successfully  accomplished. Unless willing to make the above sacrifice, no woman  should ever marry; because she would not then be fulfilling the  marriage covenant. Besides, she would be false to her husband and this  falsity might cause his moral and physical destruction; his health would  suffer and his manhood become dethroned, because her conduct would  utterly controvert the immutable laws of nature. Nature's laws cannot  possibly be set aside without the infliction of a severe penalty. The  healthy young woman will have no difficulty in preserving her chastity  intact, so long as she cultivates that purity of mind to which she is  naturally prone. She should never allow herself to read immoral stories  or books having in the slightest degree even, such a tendency;  theatrical plays with loose morals should also be avoided, and light,  silly novels are very pernicious to the imaginative mind of the young.  On the other hand useful reading stores the mind with high and noble  thoughts, whence spring good and useful deeds.    Unfortunately there are a variety of morbid conditions to which the  female is liable, so that sexual desires arise in spite of every effort  to keep aloof from them--even though there is not the slightest guilt in  mental or bodily transgression. These are owing to disordered conditions  of the sexual system, just as other disorderly desires arise, and are  often _inherited_--remember this all parents!--or they may be caused by  some morbific influences, as are other diseased conditions of the body.  Many a time have I had pure-minded young ladies apply to me for medical  aid in these matters, confessing that they had impure thoughts which  they knew were wrong, but of which they could not rid themselves. In  such cases there are physical symptoms of some kind that incite these  thoughts and feelings. The proper medical and hygienic treatment always  restores order in such functional derangements and the sexual  disturbances of the mind disappear. I have repeatedly cured nymphomania  by curing physical, or constitutional symptoms. In one case which came  under my care, nymphomania appeared in a married woman in the seventh  month of her pregnancy, and so fearfully did her mania rage that it  threw her into convulsions. Her physical and sensational symptoms led me  to the choice of the medicine that cured her, so that she was happily  delivered of a fine, healthy child at full term and no trace of the  disease has ever appeared since. Too often young women err and give way  to such feelings in resorting to _self-abuse_ for relief, or to the  caresses of the opposite sex, when they are ruined forever. It is never  safe to temporize or to tamper in this way with such sensations. Women  have heads and brains, as well as men, and rational faculties, too.  Every digression allowed, only paves the way for others, with less and  less resistance, and more and more ruinous results. Let a judicious  physician be consulted at once in all cases where a morbid condition  seems to excite immoral thoughts and sensations.    The effects of self-abuse upon woman, is as disastrous as masturbation  upon males. A few hours after its commission, or the next day at  furthest, she feels languid and dragged out, sleepy, unfit for reading  anything solid, or studying, and unfit for social enjoyment with others;  she looks pale and haggard; often she feels giddy, particularly when  rising in the morning, with many other discomforts too numerous to  mention here. And is it true that some young ladies, the sweetest and  fairest of our race, play with one another in an immodest and indecent  way, teaching immorality to the pure and innocent? I fear it is, I  _know_ it is. Such things need not, must not, and will not be tolerated.  This"]]]
