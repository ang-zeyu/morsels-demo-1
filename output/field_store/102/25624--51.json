They know just as much as Jeff did about the countries  where they make it. It stands to reason.    Did I say that Jeff shaved in the same old way? Not quite. There was  something even dreamier about it now, and a sort of new element in the  way Jeff fell out of his monotone into lapses of thought that I, for  one, misunderstood. I thought that perhaps getting so much money,--well,  you know the way it acts on people in the larger cities. It seemed  to spoil one's idea of Jeff that copper and asbestos and banana lands  should form the goal of his thought when, if he knew it, the little shop  and the sunlight of Mariposa was so much better.    In fact, I had perhaps borne him a grudge for what seemed to me his  perpetual interest in the great capitalists. He always had some item out  of the paper about them.    \"I see where this here Carnegie has give fifty thousand dollars for one  of them observatories,\" he would say.    And another day he would pause in the course of shaving, and almost  whisper: \"Did you ever _see_ this Rockefeller?\"    It was only by a sort of accident that I came to know that there was  another side to Jefferson's speculation that no one in Mariposa ever  knew, or will ever know now.    I knew it because I went in to see Jeff in his house one night. The  house,--I think I said it,--stood out behind the barber shop. You went  out of the back door of the shop, and through a grass plot with petunias  beside it, and the house stood at the end. You could see the light  of the lamp behind the blind, and through the screen door as you came  along. And it was here that Jefferson used to sit in the evenings when  the shop got empty.    There was a round table that The Woman used to lay for supper, and after  supper there used to be a chequered cloth on it and a lamp with a shade.  And beside it Jeff would sit, with his spectacles on and the paper  spread out, reading about Carnegie and Rockefeller. Near him, but away  from the table, was The Woman doing needlework, and Myra, when she  wasn't working in the Telephone Exchange, was there too with her elbows  on the table reading Marie Corelli--only now, of course, after the  fortune, she was reading the prospectuses of Dramatic Schools.    So this night,--I don't know just what it was in the paper that caused  it,--Jeff laid down what he was reading and started to talk about  Carnegie.    \"This Carnegie, I bet you, would be worth,\" said Jeff, closing up his  eyes in calculation, \"as much as perhaps two million dollars, if you was  to sell him up. And this Rockefeller and this Morgan, either of them, to  sell them up clean, would be worth another couple of million--\"    I may say in parentheses that it was a favourite method in Mariposa if  you wanted to get at the real worth of a man, to imagine him clean sold  up, put up for auction, as it were. It was the only way to test him.    \"And now look at 'em,\" Jeff went on. \"They make their money and what do  they do with it? They give it away. And who do they give it to? Why, to  those as don't want it, every time. They give it to these professors and  to this research and that, and do the poor get any of it? Not a cent and  never will.\"    \"I tell you, boys,\" continued Jeff (there were no boys present, but in  Mariposa all really important speeches are addressed to an imaginary  audience of boys)--\"I tell you, if I was to make a million out of this  Cubey, I'd give it straight to the poor, yes, sir--divide it up into a  hundred lots of a thousand dollars each and give it to the people that  hadn't nothing.\"    So always after that I knew just what those bananas were being grown  for.    Indeed, after that, though Jefferson never spoke of his intentions  directly, he said a number of things that seemed to bear on them. He  asked me, for instance, one day, how many blind people it would take to  fill one of these blind homes and how a feller could get ahold of them.  And at another time he asked whether if a feller advertised for some of  these incurables a feller could get enough of them to make a showing.  I know for a fact that he got Nivens, the lawyer, to draw up a document  that was to give an acre of banana land in Cuba to every idiot in  Missinaba county.    But still,--what's the use of talking of what Jeff meant to do? Nobody  knows or cares about it now.    The end of it was bound to come. Even in Mariposa some of the people  must have thought so. Else how was it that Henry Mullins made such a  fuss about selling a draft for forty thousand on New York? And why was  it that Mr. Smith wouldn't pay Billy, the desk clerk, his back wages  when he wanted to put it into Cuba?    Oh yes; some of them must have seen it. And yet when it came it seemed  so quiet,--ever so quiet,--not a bit like the Northern Star mine and  the oyster supper and the Mariposa band. It is strange how quiet these  things look, the other way round.    You remember the Cuban Land frauds in New York and Porforio Gomez  shooting the detective, and him and Maximo Morez getting clear away with  two hundred thousand? No, of course you don't; why, even in the city  papers it only filled an inch or two of type, and anyway the names were  hard to remember. That was Jeff's money--part of it. Mullins got the  telegram, from a broker or someone, and he showed it to Jeff just as he  was going up the street with an estate agent to look at a big empty lot  on the hill behind the town--the very place for these incurables.    And Jeff went back to the shop so quiet--have you ever seen an animal  that is stricken through, how quiet it seems to move?    Well, that's how he walked.    And since that, though it's quite a little while ago, the shop's open  till eleven every night now, and Jeff is shaving away to pay back that  five hundred that Johnson, the livery man, sent to the Cubans, and--    Pathetic? tut! tut! You don't know Mariposa. Jeff has to work pretty  late, but that's nothing--nothing at all, if you've worked hard all your  lifetime. And Myra is back at the Telephone Exchange--they were glad  enough to get her, and she says now that if there's one thing she hates,  it's the stage, and she can't see how the actresses put up with it.    Anyway, things are not so bad. You see it was just at this time that  Mr. Smith's caff opened, and Mr. Smith came to Jeff's Woman and said he  wanted seven dozen eggs a day, and wanted them handy, and so the hens  are back, and more of them, and they exult so every morning over the  eggs they lay that if you wanted to talk of Rockefeller in the barber  shop you couldn't hear his name for the cackling.          THREE. The Marine Excursions of the Knights of Pythias    Half-past six on a July morning! The Mariposa Belle is at the wharf,  decked in flags, with steam up ready to start.    Excursion day!    Half past six on a July morning, and Lake Wissanotti lying in the sun as  calm as glass. The opal colours of the morning light are shot from the  surface of the water.    Out on the lake the last thin threads of the mist are clearing away like  flecks of cotton wool.    The long call of the loon echoes over the lake. The air is cool and  fresh. There is in it all the new life of the land of the silent pine  and the moving waters. Lake Wissanotti in the morning sunlight! Don't  talk to me of the Italian lakes, or the Tyrol or the Swiss Alps. Take  them away. Move them somewhere else. I don't want them.    Excursion Day, at half past six of a summer morning! With the boat all  decked in flags and all the people in Mariposa on the wharf, and the  band in peaked caps with big cornets tied to their bodies ready to play  at any minute! I say! Don't tell me about the Carnival of Venice and  the Delhi Durbar. Don't! I wouldn't look at them. I'd shut my eyes! For  light and colour give me every time an excursion out of Mariposa down  the lake to the Indian's Island out of sight in the morning mist. Talk  of your Papal Zouaves and your Buckingham Palace Guard! I want to see  the Mariposa band in uniform and the Mariposa Knights of Pythias with  their aprons and their insignia and their picnic baskets and their  five-cent cigars!    Half past six in the morning, and all the crowd on the wharf and the  boat due to leave in half an hour. Notice it!--in half an hour. Already  she's whistled twice (at six, and at six fifteen), and at any minute  now, Christie Johnson will step into the pilot house and pull the string  for the warning whistle that the boat will leave in half an hour.  So keep ready. Don't think of running back to Smith's Hotel for the  sandwiches. Don't be fool enough to try to go up to the Greek Store,  next to Netley's, and buy fruit. You'll be left behind for sure if you  do. Never mind the sandwiches and the fruit! Anyway, here comes Mr.  Smith himself with a huge basket of provender that would feed a factory.  There must be sandwiches in that. I think I can hear them clinking.  And behind Mr. Smith is the German waiter from the caff with another  basket--indubitably lager beer; and behind him, the bar-tender of the  hotel, carrying nothing, as far as one can see. But of course if you  know Mariposa you will understand that why he looks so nonchalant and  empty-handed is because he has two bottles of rye whiskey under his  linen duster. You know, I think, the peculiar walk of a man with two  bottles of whiskey in the inside pockets of a linen coat. In Mariposa,  you see, to bring beer to an excursion is quite in keeping with public  opinion. But, whiskey,--well, one has to be a little careful.    Do I say that Mr. Smith is here? Why, everybody's here. There's Hussell  the editor of the Newspacket, wearing a blue ribbon on his coat, for  the Mariposa Knights of Pythias are, by their constitution, dedicated to  temperance; and there's Henry Mullins, the manager of the Exchange Bank,  also a Knight of Pythias, with a small flask of Pogram's Special in his  hip pocket"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#9)"],[1,"it  possible, the order of Enoch, the system of divine economy whereby the  Zion of the ancients was redeemed and sanctified, had been newly  revealed to the Zion-builders of the last days.    What says Moses of Enoch and his city?        \"And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one      heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no      poor among them.\"    Oh, the sweetness of those simple words! Oh, the sublimity of the  picture they portray! Liberty, equality, fraternity! This is Zion--THE  PURE IN HEART!    But the Saints in Jackson County, Missouri, were not all that the Lord  requires of a people chosen to execute a purpose so sacred, so  sublime. \"There were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and  strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by  these things they polluted their inheritances.\" Then was the lash of  the Philistine applied, and they were driven forth from the goodly  land. Satan hath his mission, as well as Christ.    Be it not inferred, however, that these hapless victims of mobocratic  tyranny were utterly wicked and depraved, or that all were equally  culpable in the eyes of Him, who, to punish the transgressors,  permitted their enemies to come against them. With all their faults  they were better far than their oppressors, more than the peers, in  every Christian virtue, of the people of the world around them. Yet,  judged by the higher law, the Gospel standard, which the world had not  received, and were not under the same obligation to obey, these  \"children of the Light\" were found remiss in many things.    The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a field of grain, gathered unto  the threshing-floor. The purpose of divine punishment is to purify.  Upon the wheat and the chaff, alike, fell the iron flail of  persecution.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE ZION'S CAMP EXPEDITION--JOSEPH AS A PROPHET-GENERAL--FINDING OF  THE BONES OF ZELPH, THE ANCIENT--REBELLION IN THE CAMP--JOSEPH  PREDICTS A SCOURGE--HEBER'S FAILURE AS A LAUNDERER--ZION'S CAMP SAVED  BY A STORM.    \"Gather up the strength of my house, and go up and redeem Zion!\" Such  was the burden of God's command to Joseph and his brethren in  Kirtland. Such was their interpretation of the divine message and  call.    Bidding farewell to his family and friends, whom he hardly dared hope  he would ever meet again in the flesh, Heber enrolled himself in the  little band of heroes who set out from Kirtland early in May, 1834.  They were about one hundred strong, well armed and equipped, and were  led by the Prophet Joseph in person. Subsequently their number  increased to two hundred and five souls. But Heber will tell his own  story of that eventful pilgrimage. Says he:    \"Brother Joseph received a revelation concerning the redemption of  Zion, part of which remains to be fulfilled. He sent messengers to the  east and to the west and to the north and to the south, to gather up  the Elders, and he gathered together as many of the brethren as he  conveniently could, with what means they could spare, to go up to  Zion, to render all the assistance that we could to our afflicted  brethren. We gathered clothing and other necessaries to carry up to  our brethren and sisters who had been plundered; and putting our  horses to the wagons, and taking our firelocks and ammunition, we  started on our journey; leaving only Oliver Cowdery, Sidney Rigdon and  a few aged workmen who were engaged on the temple; so that there were  very few men left in Kirtland. Our wagons were about full with  baggage, etc., consequently we had to travel on foot.    \"We started on the 5th of May, and truly this was a solemn morning to  me. I took leave of my wife and children and friends, not knowing  whether I would see them again in the flesh, as myself and brethren  were threatened both in that country and in Missouri by enemies, that  they would destroy us and exterminate us from the land.    \"There were about one hundred brethren in our company who started for  Zion. These brethren were nearly all young men, and nearly all Elders,  Priests, Teachers and Deacons. The second day we arrived at New  Portage, being about forty miles, at which place on the 7th we made  regulations for traveling, and appointed a paymaster, whose name was  Frederick G. Williams, and put all our moneys into a general fund.  Some of the brethren had considerable, and others had little or none,  yet all became equal. While here one of my horses received a kick from  another horse, which obliged me to trade away my span, and get another  span of older horses, from Jonathan Taylor. We then proceeded on our  journey twelve miles to the Chippeway River. Here we pitched our tents  under a fine grove.    \"The next day we were divided into companies of twelve each, and  captains were appointed over each company. I organized my company in  the following manner, appointing two to attend to cooking, two to see  that fires were made, two to prepare the tent at night and likewise  the bedding, and also to strike the tent each morning, two to fetch  and provide water, one to do the running, two to attend the horses,  see that the wagon was greased and everything prepared for starting.  My business was to see that the company was provided for, and that all  things were done in order. Our living generally was very good, being  able to buy bread from the bakers or inhabitants on the way through  the settled part of the country. After this we purchased flour and had  to bake our own bread. We sometimes had to live on Johnny cake and  corn dodger, and sometimes our living was scant. Every night before we  went to bed we united in our tent and offered up our prayers before  the Lord for protection. This was done by all the companies, at the  sound of a trumpet; and at the sound of a trumpet in the morning,  every man was upon his knees, each one being called upon in his turn  to be mouth in prayer. The same order was attended to in each tent.  There were general officers appointed over the company, viz: Joseph  Smith, commander; Dr. F. G. Williams, quartermaster and historian of  the camp; Zerubbabel Snow and Nathan Tanner, commissaries of  subsistence; Sylvester Smith, adjutant; and Roger Orton, captain of  the guard.    \"On the 8th we started on our journey, and on Saturday the 10th we  passed through Mansfield, and camped for the Sabbath in Richfield. On  Sunday the 11th Brother Sylvester Smith preached and the sacrament of  bread and wine was administered to the company. On Monday the 12th we  crossed over the Sandusky plains, and through the Indian settlements.  We then passed through a long range of beech woods where the roads  were very bad. In many instances we had to fasten ropes to the wagons  to haul them out of the sloughs and mud holes by hand. While passing  through the woods the brethren scattered on each side of the road and  went to hunting for wild game. We came to Belle Fontaine, where we  first discovered refractory feelings in Sylvester Smith.    \"We passed through a very pleasant country to Dayton, Ohio, where we  crossed the Miami river, which is a very beautiful stream; the water  being only about two and a half feet deep, most of the brethren waded  it. We arrived at this place on Friday the 16th. The brethren were in  good spirits, and the Lord was with us. On Saturday the 17th we passed  into Indiana, just over the line betwixt the States of Ohio and  Indiana, where we camped for the Sabbath, having traveled forty miles  that day; our feet were very sore and blistered, and our stockings  were wet with blood, the weather being very warm. I walked most of the  journey, letting the lame and footsore ride in my stead. I frequently  invited the Prophet to ride, seeing him lame and footsore. On such  occasions he would bless me and my team with a hearty good will. My  team performed the journey very well.    \"During the night a spy from the enemy attempted to get into our camp,  but was stopped by the guard. We had our sentinels or guards appointed  every night, on account of spies continually harrassing us. This  evening there was quite a difficulty between some of the brethren and  Sylvester Smith, on occasion of which Brother Joseph was called to  decide the matter. Finding quite a rebellious spirit in Sylvester  Smith, and to some extent in others, he said they would meet with  misfortunes, difficulties and hindrances, 'and you will know it before  you leave this place;' exhorting them to humble themselves before the  Lord, and become united, that they might not be scourged. A very  singular occurrence took place that night and the next day, concerning  our teams. On the following morning when we arose we found almost  every horse in the camp so badly foundered that we could scarcely lead  them a few rods to the water. The brethren then deeply realized the  effects of discord. When Brother Joseph learned the fact he exclaimed  to the brethren that for a witness that God overruled and had His eye  upon them, that all those who would humble themselves before the Lord  should know that the hand of God was in this misfortune, and their  horses should be restored to health immediately; and by twelve o'clock  the same day the horses were as nimble as ever, with the exception of  one of Sylvester Smith's which soon afterwards died.    \"May 21st we passed through Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana,  where we crossed White River. The teams forded the river, and most of  the brethren crossed over the new bridge which was unfinished. We had  been threatened by our enemies that we should not go through the town,  but we passed through unmolested. Everything appeared to be in perfect  silence as we went through, although the people looked aghast as if  fear had come upon them. At night we camped on an open spot, the top  of an eminence. Here we lost one horse.    \"On Sunday, the 25th, we arrived at the edge of Illinois; we had"]]]
