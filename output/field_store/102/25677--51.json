The boy,  shaking and shivering, made a spluttering noise with his lips; after  that he could eat of the hitherto forbidden food.    This did not necessarily refer to his totem, but any food wunnarl to  him, though it is possible that there may have been a time in tribal  history, now forgotten, when totems were wunnarl, and these ceremonies  may be all that is left to point to that time.    When a boy, after his first Boorah, killed his first emu, whether it  was his Dhe, or totem, or not, his father made him lie on the bird  before it was cooked. Afterwards a wirreenun (wizard) and the father  rubbed the fat on the boy's joints, and put apiece of the flesh in his  mouth. 'The boy chewed it, making a noise as he did so of fright and  disgust; finally he dropped the meat from his mouth, making a blowing  noise through his lips of 'Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!' After that he could eat the  flesh.    A girl, too, had to be rubbed with the fat and blood of anything from  which the wunnarl was to be removed for her. No ceremony of this sort  would be gone through with the flesh, fat, or blood of any one's  yunbeai, or individual familiar animal, for under no circumstances  would any one kill or eat their yunbeai.    Concerning the yunbeai, or animal familiar of the individual, conferred  by the medicine men, more is to be said in the ensuing chapters. The  yunbeai answers to the Manitu obtained by Red Indians during the fast  at puberty; to the 'Bush Soul' of West Africa; to the Nagual of South  American tribes; and to the Nyarong of Borneo. The yunbeai has hitherto  been scarcely remarked on among Australian tribes. Mr. Thomas declares  it to be 'almost non-existent' in Australia, mentioning as exceptions  its presence among the Euahlayi; the Wotjobaluk in Victoria; the  Yaraikkanna of Cape York; and 'probably' some of the northern tribes on  the other side of the Gulf of Carpentaria. [MAN (1904), No. 53, p. 85.]    Perhaps attention has not been directed to the animal familiar in  Australia, or perhaps it is really an infrequent thing among the  tribes.          CHAPTER IV    THE MEDICINE MEN      I used to wonder how the wirreenuns or doctor-wizards of the tribe  attained their degrees.    I found out that the old wizards fix upon a young boy who is to follow  their profession. They take him to a tribal burial-ground at night.  There they tie him down and leave him, after having lit some fires of  fat at short distances round him.    During the night that boy, if he be shaky in his nerves, has rather a  bad time.    One doctor of our tribe gave me a recital of his own early experience.    He said, after the old fellows had gone, a spirit came to him, and  without undoing his fastenings by which he was bound, turned him over,  then went away. Scarcely had the spirit departed when a big star fell  straight from the sky alongside the boy; he gazed fixedly at it, and  saw emerge from it, first the two hind legs, then the whole of a Beewee  or iguana. The boy's totem was a Beewee, so he knew it would not hurt  him. It ran close up to him, climbed on him, ran down his whole length,  then went away.    Next came a snake straight towards his nose, hissing all the time. He  was frightened now, for the snake is the hereditary enemy of the  iguana. The boy struggled to free himself, but ineffectually. He tried  to call out but found himself dumb. He tried to shut his eyes, or turn  them from the snake, but was powerless to do so. The snake crawled on  to him and licked him. Then it went away, leaving the boy as one  paralysed. Next came a huge figure to him, having in its hand a gunnai  or yam stick. The figure drove this into the boy's head, pulled it out  through his back, and in the hole thus made placed a 'Gubberah,' or  sacred stone, with the help of which much of the boy's magic in the  future was to be worked.    This stone was about the size and something the shape of a small lemon,  looking like a smoothed lump of semi-transparent crystal. It is in such  stones that the wi-wirreenuns, or cleverest wizards, see visions of the  past, of what is happening in the present at a distance, and of the  future; also by directing rays from them towards their victims they are  said to cause instantaneous death.    Next, to the doctor-boy on trial, came the spirits of the dead who  corroboreed round him, chanting songs full of sacred lore as regards  the art of healing, and instructions how, when he needed it, he could  call upon their aid.    Then they silently and mysteriously disappeared. The next day one of  the old wizards came to release the boy; he kept him away from the camp  all day and at night took him to a weedah, or bower-bird's, playground.  There he tied him down again, and there the boy was visited again by  the spirits of the dead, and more lore was imparted to him.    The reason given for taking him to a weedah's playground is, that  before the weedah was changed into a bird, he was a great wirreenun;  that is why, as a bird, he makes such a collection of pebbles and bones  at his playground.    The bower-bird's playgrounds are numerous in the bush. They are made of  grass built into a tent-shaped arch open at each end, through which the  weedahs run in and out, and scattered in heaps all around are white  bones and black stones, bits of glass, and sometimes we have found  coins, rings, and brooches.    The weedahs do not lay their eggs at their playgrounds their nests are  hard to find. A little boy always known as 'Weedah,' died lately, so  probably a new name will have to be found for the bird, or to mention  it will be taboo, at all events before the old people, who never allow  the names of the dead to be mentioned.    For several nights the medical student was tied down in case he should  be frightened and run away, after that he was left without bonds. He  was kept away from the camp for about two months. But he was not  allowed to become a practitioner until he was some years older: first  he dealt in conjuring, later on he was permitted to show his knowledge  of pharmacy.    His conjuring cures are divers.    A burn he cures by sucking lumps of charcoal from it. Obstinate pains  in the chest, the wizard says, must be caused by some enemy having put  a dead person's hair', or bone in it. Looking wisdom personified in  truly professional manner, he sucks at the affected spot, and soon  produces from his mouth hair, bones, or whatever he said was there.    If this faith-healing does not succeed, a stronger wizard than he must  have bewitched the patient; he will consult the spirits. To that end he  goes to his Minggah, a tree or stone--more often a tree, only the very  greatest wirreenuns have stones, which are called Goomah--where his own  and any spirits friendly towards him may dwell.    He finds out there who the enemy is, and whence he obtained his poison.  If a wirreenun is too far away to consult his friendly spirits in  person, he can send his Mullee Mullee, or dream spirit, to interview  them.    He may learn that an enemy has captured the sick person's Doowee, or  dream spirit--only wirreenuns' dream spirits are Mullee Mullee, the  others are Doowee--then he makes it his business to get that Doowee  back.    These dream spirits are rather troublesome possessions while their  human habitations sleep they can leave them and wander at will. The  things seen in dreams are supposed to be what the Doowees see while  away from the sleeping bodies. This wandering of the Doowees is a great  chance for their enemies: capture the Doowee and the body sickens;  knock the Doowee about before it returns and the body wakes up tired  and languid. Should the Doowee not return at all, the person from whom  it wandered dies. When you wake up unaccountably tired in the morning,  be sure your Doowee has been 'on the spree,' having a free fight or  something of that sort. And though your Doowee may give you at times  lovely visions of passing paradises, on the whole you would be better  without him.    There is on the Queensland border country a dillee bag full of  unclaimed Doowees. The wirreenun who has charge of this is one of the  most feared of wirreenuns; he is a great magician, who, with his  wonder-working glassy stones, can conjure up visions of the old fleshly  habitations of the captured Doowees.    He has Gubberahs, or clever stones, in which are the active spirits of  evil-working devils, as well as others to work good. Should a Doowee  once get into this wirreenun's bag, which has the power of  self-movement, there is not a great chance of getting it back, though  it is sometimes said to be done by a rival combination of magic. The  worst of it is that ordinary people have no power over their Doowees;  all they can do is to guard against their escaping by trying to keep  their mouths shut while asleep.    The wirreenuns are masters of their Mullee Mullees, sending them where  they please, to do what they are ordered, always provided they do not  meet a greater than themselves.    All sorts of complications arise through the substitution of mad or  evil spirits for the rightful Doowee. Be sure if you think any one has  suddenly changed his character unaccountably, there has been some  hankey-pankey with that person's Doowee. One of the greatest warnings  of coming evil is to see your totem in a dream; such a sign is a herald  of misfortune to you or one of your immediate kin. Should a wirreenun,  perhaps for enmity, perhaps for the sake of ransom, decide to capture a  Doowee, he will send his Mullee Mullee out to do it, bidding the Mullee  Mullee secrete the Doowee in his--the wirreenun's--Minggah, tree or  rock.    When he is consulted as to the return of the missing Doowee, he will  order the one who has lost it to Sleep, then the Doowee, should the  terms made suit the wirreenun, re-enters the body. Should it not do so,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#9)"],[1,"ugly in each particular; to attempt the homeliest  achievement, and to attain the bottom of derided failure; not to have any  theory but profit and yet, at an equal expense, to outstrip all  competitors in the art of conceiving and rendering permanent deformity;  and to do all this in what is, by nature, one of the most agreeable  neighbourhoods in Britain:--what are we to say, but that this also is a  distinction, hard to earn although not greatly worshipful?    Indifferent buildings give pain to the sensitive; but these things offend  the plainest taste.  It is a danger which threatens the amenity of the  town; and as this eruption keeps spreading on our borders, we have ever  the farther to walk among unpleasant sights, before we gain the country  air.  If the population of Edinburgh were a living, autonomous body, it  would arise like one man and make night hideous with arson; the builders  and their accomplices would be driven to work, like the Jews of yore,  with the trowel in one hand and the defensive cutlass in the other; and  as soon as one of these masonic wonders had been consummated,  right-minded iconoclasts should fall thereon and make an end of it at  once.    Possibly these words may meet the eye of a builder or two.  It is no use  asking them to employ an architect; for that would be to touch them in a  delicate quarter, and its use would largely depend on what architect they  were minded to call in.  But let them get any architect in the world to  point out any reasonably well-proportioned villa, not his own design; and  let them reproduce that model to satiety.          CHAPTER VIII. THE CALTON HILL.      The east of new Edinburgh is guarded by a craggy hill, of no great  elevation, which the town embraces.  The old London road runs on one side  of it; while the New Approach, leaving it on the other hand, completes  the circuit.  You mount by stairs in a cutting of the rock to find  yourself in a field of monuments.  Dugald Stewart has the honours of  situation and architecture; Burns is memorialised lower down upon a spur;  Lord Nelson, as befits a sailor, gives his name to the top-gallant of the  Calton Hill.  This latter erection has been differently and yet, in both  cases, aptly compared to a telescope and a butter-churn; comparisons  apart, it ranks among the vilest of men's handiworks.  But the chief  feature is an unfinished range of columns, 'the Modern Ruin' as it has  been called, an imposing object from far and near, and giving Edinburgh,  even from the sea, that false air; of a Modern Athens which has earned  for her so many slighting speeches.  It was meant to be a National  Monument; and its present state is a very suitable monument to certain  national characteristics.  The old Observatory--a quaint brown building  on the edge of the steep--and the new Observatory--a classical edifice  with a dome--occupy the central portion of the summit.  All these are  scattered on a green turf, browsed over by some sheep.                            [Picture: The Calton Hill]    The scene suggests reflections on fame and on man's injustice to the  dead.  You see Dugald Stewart rather more handsomely commemorated than  Burns.  Immediately below, in the Canongate churchyard, lies Robert  Fergusson, Burns's master in his art, who died insane while yet a  stripling; and if Dugald Stewart has been somewhat too boisterously  acclaimed, the Edinburgh poet, on the other hand, is most unrighteously  forgotten.  The votaries of Burns, a crew too common in all ranks in  Scotland and more remarkable for number than discretion, eagerly suppress  all mention of the lad who handed to him the poetic impulse and, up to  the time when he grew famous, continued to influence him in his manner  and the choice of subjects.  Burns himself not only acknowledged his debt  in a fragment of autobiography, but erected a tomb over the grave in  Canongate churchyard.  This was worthy of an artist, but it was done in  vain; and although I think I have read nearly all the biographies of  Burns, I cannot remember one in which the modesty of nature was not  violated, or where Fergusson was not sacrificed to the credit of his  follower's originality.  There is a kind of gaping admiration that would  fain roll Shakespeare and Bacon into one, to have a bigger thing to gape  at; and a class of men who cannot edit one author without disparaging all  others.  They are indeed mistaken if they think to please the great  originals; and whoever puts Fergusson right with fame, cannot do better  than dedicate his labours to the memory of Burns, who will be the best  delighted of the dead.                           [Picture: Queen Mary's Bath]    Of all places for a view, this Calton Hill is perhaps the best; since you  can see the Castle, which you lose from the Castle, and Arthur's Seat,  which you cannot see from Arthur's Seat.  It is the place to stroll on  one of those days of sunshine and east wind which are so common in our  more than temperate summer.  The breeze comes off the sea, with a little  of the freshness, and that touch of chill, peculiar to the quarter, which  is delightful to certain very ruddy organizations and greatly the reverse  to the majority of mankind.  It brings with it a faint, floating haze, a  cunning decolourizer, although not thick enough to obscure outlines near  at hand.  But the haze lies more thickly to windward at the far end of  Musselburgh Bay; and over the Links of Aberlady and Berwick Law and the  hump of the Bass Rock it assumes the aspect of a bank of thin sea fog.    [Picture: Arthur's Seat] Immediately underneath upon the south, you  command the yards of the High School, and the towers and courts of the  new Jail--a large place, castellated to the extent of folly, standing by  itself on the edge of a steep cliff, and often joyfully hailed by  tourists as the Castle.  In the one, you may perhaps see female prisoners  taking exercise like a string of nuns; in the other, schoolboys running  at play and their shadows keeping step with them.  From the bottom of the  valley, a gigantic chimney rises almost to the level of the eye, a taller  and a shapelier edifice than Nelson's Monument.  Look a little farther,  and there is Holyrood Palace, with its Gothic frontal and ruined abbey,  and the red sentry pacing smartly too and fro before the door like a  mechanical figure in a panorama.  By way of an outpost, you can single  out the little peak-roofed lodge, over which Rizzio's murderers made  their escape and where Queen Mary herself, according to gossip, bathed in  white wine to entertain her loveliness.  Behind and overhead, lie the  Queen's Park, from Muschat's Cairn to Dumbiedykes, St. Margaret's Loch,  and the long wall of Salisbury Crags: and thence, by knoll and rocky  bulwark and precipitous slope, the eye rises to the top of Arthur's Seat,  a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design.  This upon  your left.  Upon the right, the roofs and spires of the Old Town climb  one above another to where the citadel prints its broad bulk and jagged  crown of bastions on the western sky.--Perhaps it is now one in the  afternoon; and at the same instant of time, a ball rises to the summit of  Nelson's flagstaff close at hand, and, far away, a puff of smoke followed  by a report bursts from the half-moon battery at the Castle.  This is the  time-gun by which people set their watches, as far as the sea coast or in  hill farms upon the Pentlands.--To complete the view, the eye enfilades  Princes Street, black with traffic, and has a broad look over the valley  between the Old Town and the New: here, full of railway trains and  stepped over by the high North Bridge upon its many columns, and there,  green with trees and gardens.                           [Picture: Back of Greenside]    On the north, the Calton Hill is neither so abrupt in itself nor has it  so exceptional an outlook; and yet even here it commands a striking  prospect.  A gully separates it from the New Town.  This is Greenside,  where witches were burned and tournaments held in former days.  Down that  almost precipitous bank, Bothwell launched his horse, and so first, as  they say, attracted the bright eyes of Mary.  It is now tesselated with  sheets and blankets out to dry, and the sound of people beating carpets  is rarely absent.  Beyond all this, the suburbs run out to Leith; Leith  camps on the seaside with her forest of masts; Leith roads are full of  ships at anchor; the sun picks out the white pharos upon Inchkeith  Island; the Firth extends on either hand from the Ferry to the May; the  towns of Fifeshire sit, each in its bank of blowing smoke, along the  opposite coast; and the hills enclose the view, except to the farthest  east, where the haze of the horizon rests upon the open sea.  There lies  the road to Norway: a dear road for Sir Patrick Spens and his Scots  Lords; and yonder smoke on the hither side of Largo Law is Aberdour, from  whence they sailed to seek a queen for Scotland.        'O lang, lang, may the ladies sit,         Wi' their fans into their hand,      Or ere they see Sir Patrick Spens         Come sailing to the land!'    The sight of the sea, even from a city, will bring thoughts of storm and  sea disaster.  The sailors' wives of Leith and the fisherwomen of  Cockenzie, not sitting languorously with fans, but crowding to the tail  of the harbour with a shawl about their ears, may still look vainly for  brave Scotsmen who will return no more, or boats that have gone on their  last fishing.  Since Sir Patrick sailed from Aberdour, what a multitude  have gone down in the North Sea!  Yonder is Auldhame, where the London  smack went ashore and wreckers cut the rings from ladies' fingers; and a  few miles round Fife Ness is the fatal Inchcape, now a star of guidance;  and the lee shore to the east of the Inchcape, is that Forfarshire coast  where Mucklebackit sorrowed for his son.
