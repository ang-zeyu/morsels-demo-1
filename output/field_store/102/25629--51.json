Worlds are mansions for the home of intelligences.    Intelligences exist in order to enjoy.    Joy, in its fulness, depends on certain principles, viz.--    Life Eternal. Love Eternal. Peace Eternal. Wealth Eternal. &c.    Without the first, enjoyment lacks durability.    Without the second, it can hardly be said to exist.    Without the third, it would not be secure.    Without the fourth, it must be limited, &c.    Eternal life, in its fulness, implies a spiritual intelligence,  embodied in the likeness of its own species and clothed upon with an  outward tabernacle of eternal, incorruptible flesh and bones. This  state of existence can only be attained by the resurrection of the  body, and its eternal re-union with the spirit.    Eternal life thus attained, and endowed with the eternal attributes of  intelligence and love, could never exercise, or derive enjoyment from  the affections of the latter, unless associated with other beings  endowed with the same attributes.    Hence the object, or necessity of eternal kindred ties, associations,  and affections, exercised as the attributes of that charity which  never ends.    The third proposition, viz.--    _Eternal Peace_, could never be secured without the development of  Eternal Law and government, which would possess in itself the  attributes of infinite truth, goodness and power.    Any government short of this, could never guarantee _Eternal Peace_.  It would be liable to be overthrown, by the lack of truth to discern,  disposition to execute, or power to enforce, the measures necessary to  insure peace.    The fourth proposition, viz.--    _Eternal Wealth_, must, of necessity, consist of an everlasting  inheritance or title, defined and secured by this eternal government,  to portions of the organized elements, in their pure, incorruptible  and eternal state.    In order to be wealthy, eternal man must possess a certain portion of  the surface of some eternal planet, adapted to his order or sphere of  existence.    This inheritance, incorruptible, eternal in the heavens, must be  sufficiently extensive for his accommodation, with all his family  dependencies. It must also comprise a variety of elements, adapted to  his use and convenience. Eternal gold, silver, precious stones, and  other precious materials would be useful in the erection and  furnishing of mansions, and of public and private dwellings or  edifices.    These edifices combined, or arranged in wisdom, would constitute  eternal cities. Gardens, groves, walks, rivulets, fountains, flowers  and fruits, would beautify and adorn the landscape, please the eye,  the taste, the smell; and thus contribute gladness to the heart of  man.    Silks, linens, or other suitable materials would be necessary to adorn  his person, and to furnish and beautify his mansions.    In short, eternal man, in possession of eternal worlds, in all their  variety and fulness, will eat, drink, think, converse, associate,  assemble, disperse, go, come, possess, improve, love and enjoy. He  will increase in riches, knowledge, power, might, majesty and  dominion, in worlds without end.    Every species of the animal creation ever organized by creative  goodness, or that ever felt the pangs of death, or uttered a groan  while subject to the king of terrors, or exulted in the joys of life  and sympathy, and longed for the redemption of the body, will have  part in the resurrection, and will live for ever in their own spheres,  in the possession of peace, and a fulness of joy, adapted to their  several capacities.        O Child of earth, conceived in corruption!      Brought forth in pain and sorrow! sojourning      In a world of mourning, mid sighs and tears,      And groans, and awaiting in sadness thy home      In the gloomy grave, as food for worms;      Lift up thy head, cast thine eyes around thee,      Behold yon countless hosts of shining orbs,      Yon worlds of light and life. Then turn to earth,      Survey the solid globe, its mineral wealth,      Its gems, its precious stones, its gold, its springs;      Its gardens, forests, fruits, and flowers;      Its countless myriads of breathing life,      From _Mote to Man_, through all the varied scale      Of animated being.      Visit the gloomy caverns of the dead,      The ancient sepulchre, where e'en the worm      Of death himself, has died for want of food,      And bones disjointed are crumbled fine, and      Mingled with the dust.      Nay, deeper still, descend the fathomless      Abyss of souls condemned, in darkness chained,      Or thrust in gloomy dungeons of despair--      Where the very names of Mercy, of Hope,      And of death's conqueror remain unknown.      Observe with care the whole, indulge in tears,      But hope, believe, and clothed with charity      Which never fails, thine eyes enlightened,      Thy person clad in light ethereal.      Time fades, and opens on eternity.      Again review the scene beheld before.      You startle, seem surprised! confused! o'erwhelmed!      Death is conquered, corruption is no more,      All is _life_, and the word ETERNITY      Is inscribed in characters indelible,      On every particle and form of life.    Socrates, Plato, Confucius, and many other philosophers and divines  have written largely on the immortality of the _soul_ or spirit of  man.    Some of these have suffered, with joy and cheerfulness, imprisonment,  torture, and even death, with only this limited view of eternal  existence.    Could these martyrs to a portion of truth so limited, and yet so full  of hope and consolation, have handled immortal flesh and bones in the  persons of Enoch or Elijah translated, or of Jesus raised from the  dead; could they have learned from their sacred lips, and realized the  full import of that joyful sentence--        \"_Behold! I make all things new_;\"    could they have contemplated eternal worlds, of matter in all its  elements and forms of animal life, indissoluble and everlasting; could  they have beheld eternal man, moving in the majesty of a God, amid the  planetary systems, grasping the knowledge of universal nature, and  with an intellect enlightened by the experience and observations of  thousands and even millions of years; could they have had a glimpse of  all this, and heard the promise--        \"_There shall be no more death_,\"    issuing from the fountain of truth, prompted by infinite benevolence  and charity, re-echoing amid the starry worlds, reaching down to  earth, vibrating, with a thrill of joy, all the myriads of animated  nature, penetrating the gloomy vaults of death, and the prisons of the  spirit world, with a ray of hope, and causing to spring afresh, the  well-springs of life, and joy, and love, even in the lonely dungeons  of despair! O! how would their bosoms have reverberated with  unutterable joy and triumph, in view of changing worlds.    Could the rulers of this world have beheld, or even formed a  conception of, such riches, such nobility, such an eternal and  exceeding weight of glory, they would have accounted the wealth,  pleasures, honours, titles, dignities, glories, thrones,  principalities and crowns of this world as mere toys--the play-things  of a day, dross, not worth the strife and toil of acquiring, or the  trouble of maintaining, except as a duty, or troublesome  responsibility.    With this view of the subject, what man so base, so grovelling, so  blind to his own interests, as to neglect those duties, self-denials,  sacrifices, which are necessary in order to secure a part in the  _first_ resurrection, and a far more exceeding and eternal weight of  glory in that life which never ends?          CHAPTER VIII.    KEY OF KNOWLEDGE, POWER, AND GOVERNMENT.          Heaven's Nobility, whom worlds obey,      Clad in the brightness of eternal day,      Enthroned in majesty, as \"_Priests and Kings_,\"      To whom the universe its incense brings!      Angels, its ministers! Heaven is its throne!      The stores of infinitude are all its own!    Having given a general view of the powers, operations and effects of  Theology, as developed amongst the nations of antiquity, the mysteries  of the Godhead, the law of nature, and the origin and destiny of the  universe, the subject next in order is the KEY of knowledge, power and  government, as developed in the heavens and on the earth, for the  organization, order, peace, happiness, education, improvement, and  exaltation of intelligences in the image of God--His sons and  daughters.    The great family of man, comprising the inhabitants of unnumbered  millions of worlds, in every variety and degree of progress, consists  of five principal spheres, or grand divisions, in the scale of  progressive being, viz.--    First. _The Gods_, composed of embodied spirits, who inhabit  tabernacles of immortal flesh and bones in their most refined state,  and who are perfected in all the attributes of intelligence and power.    Second. _The Angels_, who are also composed of spirits and immortal  flesh and bones, less refined, and endowed with vast intelligence and  power, but not a fulness.    Third. _Embodied Spirits_, without a tabernacle of flesh and bones.  These are they who hate passed the veil of death, and are awaiting a  resurrection.    Fourth. _Embodied Spirits_, with mortal tabernacles, as in the present  world.    Fifth. _Embodied Spirits_, who have not yet descended to be clothed  upon with mortality, but who are candidates for the same.    There is also a sixth division, but of those we need not speak, as  they are not, as yet, included in the scale of progressive being, not  having kept their first estate.    The spirits of all men in their primeval states, were intelligent. But  among "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35490"],[0,"Seaside Studies in Natural History. Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay. (#9)"],[1,"is placed. As  it is just at this point of juncture between the tubes and the canal  that the two main horizontal tubes arise from which all the others  branch on the same plane (Figs. 27, 28), it follows that they reach  the periphery, not on a level with the pole opposite the mouth, but  removed from it by about one third the height of the body. In  consequence of this the eight vertical tubes arising from the  horizontal ones, in order to run the entire length of the body from  pole to pole, extend in opposite directions, sending a branch to each  pole, though the branch running toward the mouth is of course the  longer of the two. The tentacles have their roots in two sacs within  the body, placed at right angles with the split of the mouth. (Figs.  27, 30.) They open at the surface on the opposite side from the mouth,  though not immediately within the area at which the eye-speck is  placed, but somewhat above it, and at a little distance on either side  of it. The tentacles may be drawn completely within these sacs, or be  extended outside, as we have seen, to a greater or less degree, and in  every variety of curve or spiral.      _Bolina_. (_Bolina alata_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 31. Bolina seen from the broad side; _o_      eye-speck, _m_ mouth, _r_ auricles, _v_ digestive cavity, _g_ _h_      short rows of flappers, _a_ _f_ long rows of flappers, _n_ _x_ _t_      _z_ tubes winding in the larger lobes; about half natural size.      (_Agassiz_.)]        [Illustration: Fig. 32. Bolina seen from the narrow side; _c_ _h_      short rows of flappers, _a_ _b_ long rows of flappers; other      letters as in Fig. 31. (_Agassiz_.)]    The Bolina (Fig 32), like the Pleurobrachia, is slightly oval in form,  with a longitudinal split at one end of the body, forming a mouth  which opens into a capacious sac or digestive cavity. But it differs  from the Pleurobrachia in having the oral end of the body split into  two larger lobes (Fig. 31), hanging down from the mouth. These lobes  may gape widely, or they may close completely over the mouth so as to  hide it from view, and their different aspects under various degrees  of expansion or contraction account for the discrepancies in the  description of these animals. We have seen that the Pleurobrachia  moves with the mouth upward; but the Bolina, on the contrary, usually  carries the mouth downward, though it occasionally reverses its  position, and in this attitude, with the lobes spread open, it is  exceedingly graceful in form, and looks like a white flower with the  crown fully expanded. These broad lobes are balanced on the other  sides of the body by four smaller appendages, divided in pairs, two on  each side (Fig. 32), called auricles. These so-called auricles are in  fact organs of the same kind as the larger lobes, though less  developed. The rows of locomotive flappers on the Bolina differ in  length from each other (Fig. 31), instead of being equal, as in the  Pleurobrachia. The four longest ones are opposite each other on those  sides of the body where the larger lobes are developed, the four short  ones being in pairs on the sides where the auricles are placed. At  first sight they all seem to terminate at the margin of the body, but  a closer examination shows that the circulating tubes connected with  the longer row extend into the lobes, where they wind about in a  variety of complicated involutions. (Fig. 32.) The movements of the  Bolina are more sluggish than those of the Pleurobrachia, and the long  tentacles, so graceful an ornament to the latter, are wanting in the  former. With these exceptions the description given above of the  Pleurobrachia will serve equally well for the Bolina. The structure is  the same in all essential points, though it differs in the size and  proportion of certain external features, and its play of color is less  brilliant than that of the Pleurobrachia. The Bolina, with its slow,  undulating motion, its broad lobes sometimes spreading widely, at  other times folded over the mouth, its delicacy of tint and texture,  and its rows of vibrating fringes along the surface, is nevertheless a  very beautiful object, and well rewards the extreme care without which  it dies at once in confinement.      _Idyia_. (_Idyia roseola_ AG.)        [Illustration: Fig. 33. Idyia roseola seen from the broad side,      half natural size; _a_ anal opening, _b_ lateral tube, _c_      circular tube, _d_ _e_ _f_ _g_ _h_ rows of locomotive flappers.      (_Agassiz_.)]    The lowest genus of Ctenophorae found on our coast, the Idyia (Fig.  33), has neither the tentacles of the Pleurobrachia, nor the lobes of  the Bolina. It is a simple ovate sphere, the interior of which is  almost entirely occupied by an immense digestive cavity. It would seem  that the reception and digestion of food is intended to be the almost  exclusive function of this animal, for it has a mouth whose ample  dimensions correspond with its capacious stomach. Instead of the  longitudinal split serving as a mouth, in the Bolina and  Pleurobrachia, one end of the body in the Idyia is completely open  (Fig. 33), so that occasionally some unsuspicious victim of smaller  diameter than itself may be seen to swim into this wide portal, when  suddenly the door closes behind him with a quick contraction, and he  finds himself a prisoner. The Idyia does not always obtain its food  after this indolent fashion however, for it often attacks a Bolina or  Pleurobrachia as large or even larger than itself, when it extends its  mouth to the utmost, slowly overlapping the prey it is trying to  swallow by frequent and repeated contractions, and even cutting off by  the same process such portions as cannot be forced into the digestive  cavity.    The general internal structure of the Idyia corresponds with that of  the Bolina and Pleurobrachia; it has the same tubes branching  horizontally from the main cavity, then ramifying as they approach the  periphery till they are multiplied to eight in all, each of which  gives off one of the vertical tubes connected with the eight rows of  locomotive flappers. Opposite the mouth is the eye-speck, placed as in  the two other genera, at the centre of a small circumscribed area,  which in the Idyia is surrounded by delicate fringes, forming a  rosette at this end of the body. These animals are exceedingly  brilliant in color; bright pink is their prevailing hue, though pink,  red, yellow, orange, green, and purple, sometimes chase each other in  quick succession along their locomotive fringes. At certain seasons,  when most numerous, they even give a rosy tinge to patches on the  surface of the sea. Their color is brightest and deepest before the  spawning season, but as this advances, and the ovaries and spermaries  are emptied, they grow paler, retaining at last only a faint pink  tint. They appear early in July, rapidly attain their maximum size,  and are most numerous during the first half of August. Toward the end  of August they spawn, and the adults are usually destroyed by the  early September storms, the young disappearing at the same time, not  to be seen again till the next summer. It is an interesting question,  not yet solved, to know what becomes of the summer's brood in the  following winter. They probably sink into deep waters during this  intervening period. The Idyia, like the Pleurobrachia, moves with the  mouth upward, but inclined slightly forward also, so as to give an  oblique direction to the axis of the body.[4]        [Footnote 4: Until this summer only the three genera of Ctenophorae      above mentioned were supposed to exist along our coast, but during      the present season I have had the good fortune to find two      additional ones. One of them, the Lesueuria, resembles a Bolina      with the long lobes so cut off, that they have a very stunted      appearance in comparison with those of the Bolina. The other, the      Mertensia, is closely allied to Pleurobrachia; it is exceedingly      flattened and pear-shaped. This species was discovered long ago by      Fabricius, but had escaped thus far the attention of other      naturalists. (_A. Agassiz_.)]          EMBRYOLOGY OF CTENOPHORAE.      All the Ctenophorae are reproduced from eggs, these eggs being so  transparent that one may follow with comparative ease the changes  undergone by the young while still within the egg envelope.  Unfortunately, however, they are so delicate that it is impossible to  keep them alive for any length of time, even by supplying them  constantly with fresh sea-water, and keeping them continually in  motion, both of which are essential conditions to their existence. It  is therefore only from eggs accidentally fished up at different stages  of growth that we may hope to ascertain any facts respecting the  sequence of their development. When hatched, the little Ctenophore is  already quite advanced. It is small when compared with the size of the  egg envelope, and long before it is set free, it swims about with  great velocity within the walls of its diminutive prison (Fig. 35).  The importance of studying the young stages of animals can hardly find  a better illustration than among the Ctenophorae. Before their  extraordinary embryonic changes were understood, many of the younger  forms had found their way into our scientific annals as distinct  animals, and our nomenclature thus became burdened with long lists of  names which will disappear as our knowledge advances.    The great size of their locomotive flappers in proportion to the rest  of the body, is characteristic of the young Ctenophorae. They seem like  large paddles on the sides of these tiny transparent spheres, and,  owing to their great power as compared with those of the adult, the  young move with extraordinary rapidity. The Pleurobrachia alone  retains its quickness of motion in after life, and although its long  graceful streamers appear only as short stumpy"]]]
