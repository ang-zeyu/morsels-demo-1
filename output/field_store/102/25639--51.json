Finally came good weather, and with it the continued voyage to the west  brought the fleet to safe anchorage on a bright February morn off Ship  Island. The live-stock landed, Iberville gave his freight consorts  permission to return to France, while he explored the mainland that now  lay fair and bright before him. The Indians were communicated with,  after many failures, but, beyond the discovery of the Pascagoula and  reports of a larger river to the west, which the Bayagoula Indians  called Malbouchia, no valuable information was obtained. Iberville  planned to reach the great river by one of its reported outlets, and,  following the main channel down, thus learn the way for his vessel; but,  the Indians giving him the slip, it only remained to search every foot  of the coast until the river was gained. He was thus thrown on his own  resources, which had never failed and were not to do so now. Iberville,  with his brother Bienville and fifty picked men, largely Canadians, and  twenty days' provisions, started February 27th, on two Biscayennes or  barges, for his difficult task, the discovery of the mouth of the  Mississippi.    It is useless to detail this journey of Iberville through an apparently  endless maze of islets, mud-banks, sand-banks, reefs, and marshy shoals,  which go to make up the great level delta of the Mississippi. It would,  even to-day, be a difficult search for most mariners without a chart,  but then well-nigh impossible. Iberville's skill and patience were  tasked to the utmost, and, when he did find the mouth of the great  river, it almost seemed to be by the intervention of Providence. On the  eve of March 3, 1699, while struggling along the mainland, to which they  persistently clung, the violence of an increasing gale threatened to  swamp their barges, despite every effort, if they kept off shore, while  every approach to watch the shore-line, and thus make certain of the  river-mouth, incurred danger of beaching and destruction. Darkness came  on and the gale increased, making certain, as it seemed to them, that  they must choose death at sea or death on land. Suddenly Iberville put  his barge before the wind, and into the face of death as his followers  thought, but it shot between huge piles of interlaced drift-wood into a  turbid stream of whitish water. Iberville put out his hand and tasted.  The water was fresh, and the Mississippi was rediscovered.    The Spaniards had spoken of the river as La Palisada, which Iberville  thought most appropriate when he saw the bristling barricades of huge  jagged trees with outstretched limbs and contorted roots borne  incessantly onward by the strong current.    Iberville camped that night at the edge of the dense rank sedge-growth,  saying: \"Stretched on the sedges and sheltered from the gale, our  pleasure is so much the greater that we feel our escape from a great  peril. It is a very lively business, this exploring the unknown shores  of a sea in shallops too small to carry sail in the open sea, too tiny  to anchor, and yet so large that they strand and ground half a league  from land.\"    The next morn was that of Mardi-Gras, when our devout explorers  celebrated mass, sang joyfully the Te Deum and raised a commemorative  cross before voyaging further.    Never in their wildest dreams could the hardy Canadian explorers from  their marshy camp in the delta of the Mississippi ever have presaged,  that in the coming time, from the many millions of future inhabitants in  the Valley of the Mississippi should be gathered tens of thousands to  celebrate the merry day of carnival in the metropolitan city that was to  spring up from their memorable voyage.    The Mississippi was near its high stage, so that travel was tediously  slow, mostly by oar. The land rose somewhat, the sedge gave way first to  cane and willows, and later to richly foliaged trees with graceful  festoons pleasing to the eye and fruitful of promise in the coming  autumn. The country, largely flooded, would have seemed uninhabited save  for the Indian ferry-boats, bundles of cane pointed at both ends and  fastened together by crossbars of wood, and an occasional column of  smoke rising in the distant blue. The rapid current obliged the oarsmen  to hug the bank closely, while diminishing food and increasing piles of  drift-wood discouraged them; but the indomitable Iberville cheered on  his Canadians, and on the fifth day, some thirty-five leagues from the  river's mouth, six pirogues, or canoes, full of Indians were seen. The  savages fled, but one was captured, and through him communication and  friendly overtures were established with the Annochys. Through these  Indians Iberville was taken to the present site of New Orleans and was  shown the portage over which the Indians travelled to Lake  Pontchartrain, and thence to the bay where the ship was at anchor.  Farther up the stream Iberville visited the village of the Bayougoulas,  which consisted of about two hundred souls. The men, well made, with  short hair and painted faces, stalked around most unconcernedly in a  naked state. The women blackened their teeth, tied up their hair in a  top-knot, tattooed their faces and breasts, and wore girdles woven of  bark fibre, dyed red or bleached white, with pendulous fringes reaching  to the knee. The ornaments of the women were metal bracelets and bangles  and fancy articles made of feathers, while the young braves wore sashes  of feathers, which, weighted with bits of metal, made merry sound as  they danced. In short, they were an inoffensive folk, content with the  simple fruits of the earth, which largely served as their sustenance.    Iberville visited one of their temples, a structure some thirty feet in  diameter, which Charlevoix describes as follows: \"In the centre were  slowly burning logs (keeping up a perpetual fire), and at the end a  platform on which lay skins of deer, buffalo, and bear, offerings to the  Chouchouacha (the opossum), the god of the Bayougoulas, which animal was  painted in red and black at various points in the temple. The roof was  decorated with the figures of various animals, among which a red fox was  conspicuous. On either side of the entrance were other animal figures,  such as bears and wolves and also various birds, but above all the  Chouchouacha (the opossum), an animal about the size and having the head  of the sucking pig, the white and gray fur of the badger, the tail of  the rat, the paws of an ape, and a sack under its stomach.\"    The great discrepancies between the topography of the river and the  descriptions given in the accounts of the journeys of La Salle and Tonti  so impressed Iberville that he was really doubtful if he was on the  Mississippi, and so his journey was pursued up the river to the Oumas, a  short distance below the mouth of the Red River. Fortunately his  brother, Bienville, obtained from an Indian chief a letter, which the  savage had carried for thirteen years, given him by Tonti, who  descended the river from Illinois in 1686 and left this letter addressed  to La Salle, whose active and loyal assistant Tonti was.    [Illustration: Bienville's Army on the River.]    Iberville was now over seven hundred miles distant from his ship, and  his original stock of provisions was exhausted, so that the men were  obliged to live on the corn of the Indians and such meat or game as  could be bought or killed. Sending his men back by the delta with the  barges, Iberville decided to try himself the route of portages to the  Gulf. With an Indian guide he entered the Ascantia, a narrow, winding  bayou, where with his four Canadians and two pirogues fifty portages  over fallen trees and drift were made the first day in a distance of  seven leagues. It is not surprising that the Indian guide, unaccustomed  to such tremendous labor and fatigue, deserted the second day. Iberville  none the less pushed on undauntedly, confident that he could reach his  ship through this unknown country, guide or no guide. Next, one of his  hardy Canadians fell sick, and Iberville took his place and oar, and in  the portages carried his end of a pirogue. After eighty portages they  passed into Lake Maurepas and next into Lake Pontchartrain, whence the  way was easy to the ship, which was reached eight hours in advance of  the barges from the delta.    In his absence of six weeks Iberville had found again the Mississippi,  explored its shores almost to the Red River, made friends with all its  native tribes, discovered the short route to the sea, travelled about  fifteen hundred miles, and had returned to his ship with every man of  his party. What volumes these few facts speak for the energy, tact,  skill, and foresight of this wonderful Canadian!    Casting about for a convenient spot Iberville decided to build his fort  at the head of Biloxi Bay, and in this unfortunate location, under the  spurring supervision of the chief, Fort Biloxi soon rose, and there on  Easter Sunday mass was celebrated, vespers sung, and a sermon preached.  On May 2, 1700, Iberville sailed for France, leaving his lieutenant,  Sauvole, as the first governor of the province of Louisiana and  Bienville second in command.    The action of France and the desperate haste of Iberville in occupying  the mouth of the Mississippi were most timely. The very month in which  our Canadian sailed from Brest an expedition left England under the  auspices of Mr. Cox, who sent out three vessels loaded with emigrants.  They wintered in the Carolinas, where many settled, but in 1700 two  ships continued their voyage to the Mississippi. One of these vessels  was commanded by a Captain Banks, who once captured by Iberville in  Hudson Bay now found himself worsted by his rival in the peaceful work  of colonization. One of the English ships appeared in the lower  Mississippi, into which Banks had found entrance, in September, 1700.

No, no! she hath nothing. Well--what then?  God? There stood the Word, the One, the Eternal.' Thereupon she reads  the greater and lesser catechisms of Luther, the creeds of the  evangelic reformed church, and the decrees and canons of the Council  of Trent. 'But only the Catholic church hath under roof and proof  brought her dogma-buildings to a tower, provided with the  lightning-rod of authority.' Thereupon she determines, 'I asked no  human being for explanation, information, or counsel--not even  myself.' Three months after, on the first day of January, 1850, she  wrote to the Cardinal Prince-Bishop of Breslau, to beg of him aid in  her entrance to the church.    \"The moral vacancy displayed in these quotations corresponds with the  shallow manner and half romantic, half French style of the book.  Though the first part be written in a fresher and livelier style than  the second, there is still not to be found in the whole a single  well-determined and clearly-impressed thought, and whenever we imagine  that we have hit upon such a thing, straightway we find whirling forth  the dust-clouds of an obscure, phrase-laden, highly affected  sentimental feeling, which, without any real energy, stirs itself up  with repeated 'ohs!' and 'ahs!' and other forced sighs and artificial  aids. In place of such thoughts we find a shallow and occasionally  insupportably wearisome speech on the ideal of Catholicism, or 'the  heathenish abomination in art and literature, which, after the fall of  Byzantium was transported thence to Italy, and there received with  that love which impels sensuous mortals to joyfully draw into the  sphere of his life the new and glittering, because it promises fresh  and shining pleasures.'(!) In another place she speaks of the  reformers as 'miserable, narrow-minded heads, who should have chosen  other ground whereon to exercise their love of quarrelling;' while  the second half of her book is confined almost exclusively to the  democrats, and the events which took place from 1847 to 1849. In this  part the authoress displays the greatest want of intellect, and is  sadly wearisome; but her frivolity of manners and morals appears most  repulsive in her account of the Reformation. None of the  Catholics--not even Cochlaeus himself--has so far degraded himself as  to interpret in such a vulgar manner the deeds of the reformers (more  particularly Luther's) as is here done by--a lady!    \"If the Countess places at the conclusion of her work the words 'Soli  Deo Gloria,' this is merely in accordance with a Catholic custom, and  by no means meant in earnest, since the work is more particularly  adapted to flatter the vanity and self-conceit of its composer, who  cannot imagine why she should suffer the disgrace to belong to the  German nation. A vain, coquettish self-regard, an affected,  aristocratic-noble nonchalance, and a contradicting, heresy-accusing  confidence of judgment, meet us on every side, and render us  completely opposed to the pretence and moral vacancy of this book.\"    These are bitter words, and bitterly spoken, when thus applied to a  woman. The reader will in their perusal remember that the writer is  evidently influenced by a deep feeling against all that savors of  conservatism in politics, and shares in an unusual degree the popular  German feeling against _emancipiste Frauen_, or women who strive  against the bonds which the customs of society have imposed on the  sex,--a feeling, which, however creditable it may be when applied to  undue extravagances of manners or morals, should be carefully guarded  against when it threatens an unconditional restraint of every exertion  of feminine genius and talent.          JULES JANIN, AND THE PARIS FEUILLETONISTES.      Jules Janin, whose name, of so constant recurrence in the contemporary  history of light literature, artistic criticism, and _feuilleton_, is  the Prince Royal of the brilliant court of gifted, tasteful, witty and  _spirituel_ writers, who compose the body of Parisian  _feuilletonistes_. These are men who write, not because they have any  thing especial to say--for their peculiar function is to say nothing,  in a pointed and brilliant manner--but because they love leisure and  luxury, the opera, pictures, and beautiful ballet girls, and must  themselves make the golden lining to their purses, which they can do  by the very simple process of weaving the similar lining of their  brains into a _feuilleton_. They are often scholars, men of fine  cultivation and genius, whose tastes however are so imperious, and who  enjoy so much the ease thus facilely achieved, that they accomplish no  great work, win no lasting name. Of course the _feuilletonist_ proper  is to be distinguished from the author or novelist who publishes a  work in the _Feuilleton_, as Lamartine his _Confidences_, and Sue and  Dumas and George Sand, their romances. We propose now to follow  briefly the sparkling career of JULES JANIN as the type of the life,  character, and success of the _feuilletonistes_.    He came to Paris, a Jew: as Meyerbeer, Heine, Grisi, Rachel, and the  long luminous list of contemporary artists who have made fame in  Paris, are Jews. He supported himself by teaching--doing nothing, but  very conscious that he could do something--at all events he could  lecture upon the Syrian language, if for a week he could prepare  himself. Then he wrote in little theatrical papers, and received  twenty-five francs a month. But in 1830 he happily succeeded to his  present position in the _Journal des Debats_. He is now a rich man. He  gives splendid soirees in his saloons glittering with oriental luxury,  and artists and authors bow before him. Like Henry Heine, his  contemporary, whom he as much resembles in talent as in manner, he  declared now for the Republic and Freedom, now for the Church and  King, until his connection with the _Debats_ impressed upon him the  conservative seal. He since loudly declaims for public  morality--against the prostitution of the press; but his early works  were the most licentious of any that have swarmed from the fertile  French genius of social protestantism. His first novel, published in  1829, _The Dead Donkey and the Guillotined Woman_, is the history of a  prostitute, from the brothel, to the murder of her child, and her  execution, garnished with Byronic sentimentalities upon the  transitoriness of things temporal.    Jules Janin's next work was one of the most instructive illustrations  of the character of French romance at that period when literary  feeling and taste seemed to reach the artificial point that is  artistically achieved by the melo-dramas of Chatham-street and the  Strand. We record it as a literary curiosity, as the work of a \"fast\"  Frenchman, a Parisian Vivian Grey, on a small scale. It is called _The  Penitent_, and was published in 1830. It opens with a marriage. The  bride, who has been violently dancing, retires, overcome with sleep,  and the husband in his rage at her sleepiness smothers her. It is  nominally supposed that she has been stricken with apoplexy, but a  Jesuit, who meditates many mysteries, understands the whole matter,  yet observes the most discreet silence. The young man, who is somewhat  conscience-pricked, still persists in profligacy, until he is  overwhelmed by remorse, and rushes to the church to receive  absolution. He seeks a trusty confessor, and of course finds the old  Jesuit; but as he finds it difficult to obtain access to him, makes  the acquaintance of a girl, with whom the Jesuit has some kind of  relation, and in order to win her to his will, seduces her! Then comes  the Jesuit and begins to fulminate excommunications and damnations.  But the youth bursts into a passionate strain of repentance, and is  told by the old Jesuit, that the difficulty in his case, is a  religious one, that in fact the murder was \"a circumstance\" arising  from his irreligious state, and that by genuine repentance the matter  will be arranged. _Presto_: The youth repents and enters the church,  is made Bishop and proceeds through an endless course of fat capon and  Chateau Margaux to an edifying end!    The boldest efforts of young France and young Germany, are feeble by  the side of this extraordinary effort. His earlier tales, which are  somewhat in the style of Hoffmann, Jules Janin published in the year  1833, under the title of _Fantastic Tales_, and a series of works of  less size and importance followed, until the series of papers, half  fiction, half fact, which, in the novel form, treated a great variety  of historico-literary subjects. His last romance is the _Nun of  Toulouse_, written during the revolution of '48. It sparkles with the  same sprightly skepticism and spiritual coquetry that distinguished  his earlier works, yet he celebrates in it those beautiful times, the  \"old times,\" in which the serenity of faith was never ruffled by  impertinent thought; and in his recent letters from the Great  Exhibition, he indulges in the same strain, and sighs for the  magnificence of the monarchy.    But his weekly contributions to the _Debats_, the rapid dashing review  of the dramatic novelties and incidents in a metropolis where alone a  living drama survives, and which he serves up garnished with the most  felicitous verbal graces and the most charming intellectual conceits,  every Monday morning--these are the flowers whence the brilliant Jules  Janin builds the honey hive of his reputation. He has decreed the  fashion of the _Feuilleton_, and the other Parisian critics flash and  snap and sparkle, as much like Jules Janin as possible. Their articles  are the streak of _light_ in the dimness of the preponderating  political literature of the week. They hold high holiday at the bottom  of the page, although the history of revolutions, and woes, and the  rumors of wars and"]]]
