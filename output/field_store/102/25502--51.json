For He draweth up the drops of water,        Which distil in rain from His vapour:        Which the skies pour down        And drop upon man abundantly.\"    Throughout the books of Holy Scripture, the connection between the  clouds and the rain is clearly borne in mind. Deborah says in her song  \"the clouds dropped water.\" In the Psalms there are many references. In  lxxvii. 17, \"The clouds poured out water;\" in cxlvii. 8, \"Who covereth  the heaven with clouds, Who prepareth rain for the earth.\" Proverbs xvi.  15, \"His favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.\" The Preacher says  that \"clouds return after the rain\"; and Isaiah, \"I will also command  the clouds that they rain no rain upon it\"; and Jude, \"Clouds they are  without water, carried about of winds.\"    The clouds, too, were not conceived as being heavy. Nahum says that \"the  clouds are the dust of His feet,\" and Isaiah speaks of \"a cloud of dew  in the heat of harvest.\" The Preacher clearly understood that \"the  waters above\" were not pent in by solid barriers; that they were  carried by the clouds; for \"if the clouds be full of rain, they empty  themselves upon the earth.\" And Job says of Jehovah, \"He bindeth up the  waters in His thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them;\" and,  later, Jehovah Himself asks:--         \"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,        That abundance of waters may cover thee?                *       *       *       *       *          Who can number the clouds by wisdom,        Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?\"    The Hebrews, therefore, were quite aware that the waters of the sea were  drawn up into the atmosphere by evaporation, and were carried by it in  the form of clouds. No doubt their knowledge in this respect, as in  others, was the growth of time. But there is no need to suppose that,  even in the earlier stages of their development, the Hebrews thought of  the \"waters that be above the heavens\" as contained in a literal cistern  overhead. Still less is there reason to adopt Prof. Schiaparelli's  strange deduction: \"Considering the spherical and convex shape of the  firmament, the upper waters could not remain above without a second wall  to hold them in at the sides and the top. So a second vault above the  vault of the firmament closes in, together with the firmament, a space  where are the storehouses of rain, hail, and snow.\"[43:1] There seems to  be nowhere in Scripture the slightest hint or suggestion of any such  second vault; certainly not in the beautiful passage to which Prof.  Schiaparelli is here referring.         \"Where is the way to the dwelling of light,        And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;        That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,        And that thou shouldst discern the paths to the house thereof.                *       *       *       *       *          Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,        Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,        Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,        Against the day of battle and war?        By what way is the light parted,        Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?        Who hath cleft a channel for the water-flood,        Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;               *       *       *       *       *                    Hath the rain a father?        Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?        Out of whose womb came the ice?        And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?\"    The Song of David, Psalm xviii., clearly shows that its writer held no  fantasy of a solidly built cistern of waters in the sky, but thought of  the \"dark waters\" in the heavens, as identical with the \"thick clouds.\"  The passage is worth quoting at some length, not merely as supplying a  magnificent word picture of a storm, but as showing the free and  courageous spirit of the Hebrew poet, a spirit more emancipated than can  be found in any other nation of antiquity. It was not only the gentler  aspect of nature that attracted him; even for its most terrible, he had  a sympathy, rising, under the influence of his strong faith in God, into  positive exultation in it.         \"In my distress I called upon the Lord,        And cried unto my God:        He heard my voice out of His temple,        And my cry before Him came into His ears.        Then the earth shook and trembled,        The foundations also of the mountains moved        And were shaken, because He was wroth.        There went up a smoke out of His nostrils,        And fire out of His mouth devoured:        Coals were kindled by it.        He bowed the heavens also, and came down;        And thick darkness was under His feet.        And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly:        Yea, He flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.        He made darkness His hiding place,        His pavilion round about Him;        Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.        At the brightness before Him His thick clouds passed,        Hailstones and coals of fire.        The Lord also thundered in the heavens,        And the Most High uttered His voice;        Hailstones and coals of fire.        And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them;        Yea lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.        Then the channels of waters appeared,        And the foundations of the world were laid bare,        At Thy rebuke, O Lord,        At the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.        He sent from on high, He took me;        He drew me out of many waters.        He delivered me from my strong enemy,        And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.\"    Two other passages point to the circulation of water vapour upward from  the earth before its descent as rain; one in the prophecy of Jeremiah,  the other, almost identical with it, in Psalm cxxxv. 7: \"When He  uttereth His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and He  causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh  lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of His  treasuries.\" Here we get a hint of a close observing of nature among  the Hebrews. For by the foreshortening that clouds undergo in the  distance, they inevitably appear to form chiefly on the horizon, \"at the  ends of the earth,\" whence they move upwards towards the zenith.    A further reference to clouds reveals not observation only but acute  reflection, though it leaves the mystery without solution. \"Dost thou  know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of Him Which is  perfect in knowledge?\" There is a deep mystery here, which science is  far from having completely solved, how it is that the clouds float, each  in its own place, at its own level; each perfectly \"balanced\" in the  thin air.         \"That mist which lies in the morning so softly in the valley,       level and white, through which the tops of the trees rise as       if through an inundation--why is _it_ so heavy? and why does       it lie so low, being yet so thin and frail that it will melt       away utterly into splendour of morning, when the sun has shone       on it but a few moments more? Those colossal pyramids, huge       and firm, with outlines as of rocks, and strength to bear the       beating of the high sun full on their fiery flanks--why are       _they_ so light--their bases high over our heads, high over       the heads of Alps? why will these melt away, not as the sun       rises, but as he descends, and leave the stars of twilight       clear, while the valley vapour gains again upon the earth like       a shroud?\"[46:1]    The fact of the \"balancing\" has been brought home to us during the past  hundred years very vividly by the progress of aerial navigation.  Balloons are objects too familiar even to our children to cause them any  surprise, and every one knows how instantly a balloon, when in the  air, rises up higher if a few pounds of ballast are thrown out, or sinks  if a little of the gas is allowed to escape. We know of no balancing  more delicate than this, of a body floating in the air.    [Illustration: CIRRUS FROM SOUTH KENSINGTON, 1906, MAY 29.]    [Illustration: CUMULI FROM TUNBRIDGE WELLS, 1906, MAY 20.    (Photographs of clouds, taken by Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer.)    \"Dost thou know the balancing of the clouds?\"]    \"The spreadings of the clouds,\" mentioned by Elihu are of the same  nature as their \"balancings,\" but the expression is less remarkable. The  \"spreading\" is a thing manifest to all, but it required the mind both of  a poet and a man of science to appreciate that such spreading involved a  delicate poising of each cloud in its place.    The heavy rain which fell at the time of the Deluge is indeed spoken of  as if it were water let out of a reservoir by its floodgates,--\"the  windows of heaven were opened;\" but it seems to show some dulness on the  part of an objector to argue that this expression involves the idea of a  literal stone built reservoir with its sluices. Those who have actually  seen tropical rain in full violence will find the Scriptural phrase not  merely appropriate but almost inevitable. The rain does indeed fall like  hitherto pent-up waters rushing forth at the opening of a sluice, and it  seems unreasonable to try to place too literal an interpretation upon so  suitable a simile.    There is the less reason to insist upon this very matter-of-fact  rendering of the \"windows of heaven,\" that in two out of the three  connections in which it occurs, the expression is certainly used  metaphorically. On the occasion of the famine in the city of Samaria,  Elisha prophesied that--         \"To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be       sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in       the gate of Samaria. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned       answered the man "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#9)"],[1,"comparavit vir       clarissimus doctissimusque D.

I recommend the collector of curious and       valuable catalogues to lay hold upon the present one (of       which a more particular description will be given in another       work) whenever it comes in his way. The address \"To the       Reader,\" in which we are told that \"this so much celebrated,       so often desired, so long expected, library is now exposed       to sale,\" gives a very interesting account of the owner.       Inter alia, we are informed that Mr. Smith \"was as       constantly known every day to walk his rounds through the       shops, as to sit down to his meals, &c.;\" and that \"while       others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms, _his_       great ambition was to become master of a good book.\"         The catalogue itself justifies every thing said in       commendation of the collector of the library. The       arrangement is good; the books, in almost all departments of       literature, foreign and domestic, valuable and curious; and       among the English ones I have found some of the rarest       Caxtons to refer to in my edition of Ames. What would Mr.       Bindley, or Mr. Malone, or Mr. Douce, give to have the       _creaming_ of such a collection of \"Bundles of Stitcht Books       and Pamphlets,\" as extends from page 370 to 395 of this       catalogue! But alas! while the Bibliographer exults in, or       hopes for, the possession of such treasures, the       physiologist discovers therein fresh causes of disease, and       the philanthropist mourns over the ravages of the       BIBLIOMANIA!]         [Footnote 34: Consult Masters's \"_Memoirs of the Life and       Writings of the late Rev._ THOMAS BAKER,\" Camb. 1864, 8vo.

For some cause, I do not now       recollect what, Baker took his name off the books of St.       John's College, Cambridge, to which he belonged; but such       was his attachment to the place, and more especially to the       library, that he spent a great portion of the ensuing twenty       years of his life within the precincts of the same:       frequently comforted and refreshed, no doubt, by the sight       of the magnificent LARGE PAPER copies of Walton and Castell,       and of Cranmer's Bible UPON VELLUM!]         [Footnote 35: This THOMAS RAWLINSON, who is introduced in       the Tatler under the name _Tom Folio_, was a very       extraordinary character, and most desperately addicted to       book-hunting.

The former, on his death-bed, wrote       Collins a letter to be delivered to him, after his decease,       which was full of affection and good advice.]         [Footnote 38: It is almost impossible to dwell on the memory       of this GREAT MAN without emotions of delight--whether we       consider him as an eminent physician, a friend to       literature, or a collector of books, pictures, and coins.       Benevolence, magnanimity, and erudition were the striking       features of his character: his house was the general       receptacle of men of genius and talent, and of every thing       beautiful, precious, or rare. His curiosities, whether       books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open to the       public; and the enterprising student, and experienced       antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.       He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,       and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.       The great patron of literature, and the leader of his       profession (which he practised with a success unknown       before), it was hardly possible for unbefriended merit, if       properly introduced to him, to depart unrewarded. The       clergy, and in general, all men of learning, received his       advice _gratuitously_: and his doors were open every morning       to the _most indigent_, whom he frequently assisted with       money.
