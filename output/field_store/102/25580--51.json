By way of a  gentle hint, if you will spread your saddle blankets _beneath_ your  tarp, they will help a lot, and you will get none of the horsey aroma.    [Sidenote: Pillows]    A pillow can be made out of a little bag of muslin or cotton or denim.  In it you stuff an extra shirt, or your sweater, or some such matter. A  very small \"goose hair\" pillow may be thrust between the folds of your  blanket when you have a pack horse. It will not be large enough all by  itself, but with a sweater or a pair of trousers beneath it will be soft  and easy to a tired head. Have its cover of brown denim.    [Sidenote: Pails]    On a pack trip a pail is a necessity which is not recognized in the  forest, where you can dip your cup or kettle direct into the stream.  Most packers carry a galvanized affair, which they turn upside down on  top of the pack. There it rattles and bangs against every overhead  obstruction on the trail, and ends by being battered to leakiness. A  bucket made of heavy brown duck, with a wire hoop hemmed in by way of  rim, and a light rope for handle carries just as much water, holds it as  well, and has the great advantage of collapsing flat.    [Illustration: _Collapsible Canvas Bucket and Wash Basin._]    [Illustration: Folding Lantern.]    [Sidenote: Wash Basins and Wash Tubs]    A wash basin built on the same principle is often a veritable godsend,  and a man can even carry a similar contrivance big enough for a washtub  without adding appreciably to the bulk or weight of his animal's pack.  Crushed flat all three take up in thickness about the space of one layer  of blanket, and the weight of the lot is just a pound and a half.    [Sidenote: Lanterns]    The Stonebridge folding candle lantern is the best I know of. It folds  quite flat, has four mica windows, and is easily put together. The  measurements, folded, are only 6 x 4 inches by 1-2 inch thick, and its  weight but 13 ounces. The manufacturers make the same lantern in  aluminum, but I found it too easily bent to stand the rough handling  incidental to a horse trip. The steel lantern costs one dollar.[3]    [Sidenote: Hatchets]    If you carry an axe at all, do not try to compromise on a light one. I  never use such an implement in the woods. A light hatchet is every bit  as good for the purpose of firewood, and better when it is a question of  tent poles or pegs. Read Nessmuk's _Woodcraft_ on this subject. The  Marble Safety Axe is the best, both because of the excellent steel used  in its manufacture, and because of the ease of its transportation. I  generally carry mine in my hip pocket. Get the metal handle and  heaviest weight. I have traveled a considerable part of the Canadian  forests with no other implement of the sort.    [Sidenote: Axes]    On a horseback trip in the mountains, however, this will not suffice.  Often and often you will be called on to clear trail, to cut timber for  trail construction or to make a footing over some ultra-tempestuous  streamlet. You might peck away until further orders with your little  hatchet without much luck. Then you need an axe--not a \"half axe,\" nor a  \"three-quarter axe\"--but a full five-pound weapon with an edge you could  shave with. And you should know how to use it. \"Chewing a log in two\" is  a slow and unsatisfactory business.    To keep this edge you will carry a file and a water whetstone. Use your  hatchet as much as possible, take care of how and what you chop, and do  not wait until the axe gets really dull before having recourse to your  file and stone. It is a long distance to a grindstone. Wes Thompson  expressed the situation well. He watched the Kid's efforts for a moment  in silence.    \"Kid,\" said he sorrowfully at last, \"you'll have to make your choice.  Either you do _all the chopping or none of it_.\"    [Sidenote: Repairs]    Needle, thread, a waxed end, and a piece of buckskin for strings and  patches completes the ordinary camp outfit. Your repair kit needs  additions when applied to mountain trips, but that question will come up  under another heading.      _SUMMARY_              _Minimum for comfort_              Silk tent (sometimes)            Rubber blanket            Blanket            Pillow case of denim            Pocket axe            File and whetstone            Needle and thread            Waxed end            Piece of buckskin                _Maximum_              Tarpaulin            Blanket            Comforter            Small Pillow            Canvas bucket            Canvas wash basin            Canvas wash tub            Candle lantern and candles            Pocket axe            5 pound axe            File and whetstone            Needle and thread            Waxed end            Piece of buckskin    FOOTNOTE:    [3] One is now made of brass to fold automatically, at a slightly higher  price.            CHAPTER VI    THE COOK OUTFIT      [Sidenote: Materials]    MOST people take into the woods too many utensils and of too heavy  material. The result is a disproportion between the amount of food  transported and the means of cooking it.    I have experimented with about every material going, and used all sorts  of dishes. Once I traveled ten days, and did all my cooking in a tip cup  and on a willow switch--nor did I live badly. An ample outfit, however,  judiciously selected, need take up little bulk or weight.    [Sidenote: Tin]    Tin is the lightest material, but breaks up too easily under rough  usage. Still, it is by no means to be despised. With a little care I  have made tin coffee pots and tin pails last out a season. When through,  I discarded them. And my cups and plates are of tin to this day.    [Sidenote: Sheet Iron]    Sheet iron had its trial--a brief one. The theory was all right, but in  practice I soon found that for a long time whatever is boiled in sheet  iron pails takes on a dark purplish-black tinge disagreeable to behold.  This modifies, but never entirely disappears, with use. But also sheet  iron soon burns out and develops pin holes in the bottom.    [Sidenote: Agate Ware]    Agate or enamel ware is pleasing to the eye and easily kept clean. But a  hard blow means a crack or chip in the enameled surface, and hard blows  are frequent. An enamel ware kettle, or even cup or plate, soon opens  seams and chasms. Then it may as well be thrown away, for you can never  keep it clean.    [Sidenote: Iron]    A very light iron pot is durable and cooks well. Two of these of a size  to nest together, with the coffee pot inside, make not a bad combination  for a pack trip. Most people are satisfied with them; but for a perfect  and balanced equipment even light-gauge iron is still too heavy.    [Sidenote: Aluminum]    For a long time I had no use for aluminum. It was too soft, went to  pieces, and got out of shape too easily. Then by good fortune I chanced  to buy a pail or kettle of an aluminum alloy. That one pail I have used  constantly for five years on all sorts of trips. It shows not a single  dent or bend, and inside is as bright as a dollar. The ideal material  was found.    Short experience taught me, however, that even this aluminum alloy was  not best for every item of the culinary outfit.    [Sidenote: Utensils]    The coffee pot, kettles, and plates may be of the alloy, for it has the  property of holding heat, but by that very same token an aluminum cup is  an abomination. The coffee or tea cools before you can get your lips  next the metal. For the same reason spoons and forks are better of  steel; and of course it stands to reason that the cutting edge of a  knife must be of that material. The aluminum frying pans I have found  unsatisfactory for several reasons. The metal is not porous enough to  take grease, as does the steel pan, so that unless watched very closely  flapjacks, mush, and the like are too apt to stick and burn. In the  second place they get too hot, unless favored with more than their share  of attention. In the third place, in the case of the two I have owned, I  have been unable to keep the patent handle on for more than three weeks  after purchase.    Premising, then, the above considerations, as regards material, let us  examine now the kind and variety necessary to the most elaborate trip  you will take, at the same time keeping in mind the fact that you can  travel with merely a tin cup if you have to.      [Sidenote: Made-up Outfits]    Do not be led astray into buying a made-up outfit. The two-man set  consists of a coffee pot, two kettles, a fry pan, two each of plates,  cups, soup bowls, knives, forks, teaspoons, and dessert  spoons--everything of aluminum. All fit into the largest kettle, plates  and fry pan on top, and weigh but five pounds. The idea is good, but you  will be able to modify it to advantage.[4]    [Sidenote: A Good Two-Man Outfit]    Get for a two-man outfit two tin cups with the handles riveted, not  soldered. They will drop into the aluminum coffee pot. Omit the soup  bowls. Buy good steel knives and forks with blackwood or horn handles.  Let the forks be four-tined, if possible. Omit the teaspoons. Do not  make the mistake of tin dessert spoons. Purchase a half dozen of white  metal. All these things will go inside the aluminum coffee pot, which  will nest in the two aluminum kettles. Over the top you invert four  aluminum plates and a small tin milk pan for bread mixing and dish  washing. The latter should be of a size to fit accurately over the top  of the larger kettle. This combination will tuck away in a canvas case  about nine inches in diameter and nine high. You will want a medium-size  steel fry pan, with handle of the same piece of metal--not riveted. The  latter comes off. The outfit as modified will weigh but a pound more  than the other, and is infinitely handier.    There are several methods of cooking bread. The simplest--and the one  you will adopt on a foot trip--is to use your frying pan. The bread is  mixed, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32958"],[0,"Edge Hill: The Battle and Battlefield; With Notes on Banbury & Thereabout (#9)"],[1,"was another chapel  dedicated to honour the resurrection of our Lord. Records remain of the  armorial glass, nearly all of which was destroyed during the time of the  siege of Banbury Castle, when the church was used as a vantage point.  There were sixty coats of arms. The church was said to be the burying  place of Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, its founder, also of William Pope,  cofferer to Henry VII., and of Captayn Wm. Danvers who died \"in the  service of God and the King\" in 1643. Mr. Arden's list of the Vicars of  Banbury gives the date of death of Vicar Roger as 1278. Many of the  remains of the old fabric are in use as ornaments in Banbury gardens.    Erected about 1797, the present church stands in architecture far away  from the taste of the time. It is nevertheless a bold and good design by  Cockerill of domestic Doric style. Betwixt its beginning and its  completion so many years intervened as to give birth to the rhyme:      \"Proud Banbury, poor people,    Built a church without a steeple.\"    The portico with its semicircle of plain columns and the circular tower,  133 feet high, with its ornamental quartrefoiling and the balconied  alleis are not without massive beauty of their own. The bareness and heavy  structure of the body are compensated for by the beauty of the interior  decoration, which is of the best of the mural work of the kingdom. The  galleries and dome are supported by twelve graceful Ionic pillars,  arranged in an octagonal figure. The chancel has been re-built in unison  with the original design, and the apse is worked in colour in three  divisions representing the twelve apostles with trees of scripture in the  background. The ceiling illustrates the enthronement of Christ (Rev. iv.)  On the wall, at the east of the nave, are inscribed the tables of the  commandments. A band of gold encircles the dome, bearing the text, \"The  Lord is in His holy temple,\" &c. The painted windows are good examples of  modern work; one in the north-west gallery is in memory of the explorer,  Admiral Sir G. Back, uncle of the late vicar, and represents arctic scenes  and figures. The work was carried out at the cost of and during the office  of the late vicar, the Rev. H. Back, aided by Miss Wyatt and others. The  decorators were Messrs. Heaton, Butler and Baines. There is also a richly  inlaid marble font, and pulpit. At the time of the Victorian Jubilee the  peal of eight bells was overhauled, and new chimes with shifts for  three weeks added to the clock tower. Beesley gives four of the bells as  having been made by the Bagleys' of Chacombe, where they had a well known  17th century bell foundry. The eighth bell bears the inscription:      \"I ring to Sermon with a lusty boome    That all may come and none may stay at home.\"      [Illustration: INTERIOR ST. MARY'S CHURCH. BANBURY.]      THE VICARAGE HOUSE, dated 1649, stands against the south-west corner of  the churchyard, and is a handsome specimen of the domestic architecture of  the period. The gabled front, window mullions and porch remain of the old  work, and also the hall and front rooms. The room over the porch, used as  a private chapel, seems to be of its old service. Very carefully has the  interior ornamentation been carried out, of which the cornice of music  staves of the front room is an instance.    OLD HOUSES.--The gabled houses on the north side of the High Street, and  on the south and west sides of the Market Place, are good examples of  domestic architecture of late Tudor or early Stuart times. An old  sun-dial, bearing the motto \"Aspice et abi,\" is attached to the front of  the High Street houses. The barge boards and pargeting of the front and  the good casemated windows of the west side remain, but the roof has been  stripped of its Stonesfield slate, and the finials are badly restored.  Also worth notice is the front of No. 11 Market Place, and the old jail,  No. 3 (1646), though the lower stage has been cut away. Orchard House,  Neithrop, the front of which it is said was protected by woolsacks during  the siege of Banbury Castle, stands on a mound away from the road side. It  bears the appearance of a manor house, as it probably was, and it has a  massive oak stair-way. The Woodlands, Horse Fair, has a handsome garden  front; it was formerly an inn. The Woodlands, as well as the school house  near by, now Banbury Academy (and here Dean Swift commenced his Gulliver's  Travels, taking the title of Gulliver from the name on a tomb in the  churchyard opposite), are typical houses of the time. A beautifully carved  oak cornice remains in the north-west room of house No. 47 North Bar, Mrs.  J. Bolton's.    CALTHORPE HOUSE.--The Calthorpe Manor of old time is now sadly diminished,  its fish pond drained and its park a building ground. The north-west part  of the house is in use as a wool warehouse, but yet the east front, now  Calthorpe House School, stands in good order with stone porch, and  armorial shield of the Hawtayne's, and a good oriel window above bearing  the arms in stained glass of the Brancestre (1545) and Danvers'  families. The inscriptions thereon are \"Danvers Matched D'Oyley,\" \"Danvers  long time owned Calthropp,\" etc. The house, one of the religious houses of  early date and probably part of the hospice of St. John, was linked with  the early history of the town. Beesley and Macnamara speak of its  associations with the Brancestre family in the time of Richard II. (1378),  and later with that of Danvers. The former granted lands to the master of  St. John, thus implying a religious holding. By its reconstruction in  Queen Elizabeth's days we know the reformation had swept away its  religious order, and the fine oriel window is of that date. It is said  that Nonconformity was preached for the first time in Banbury in the oriel  room.      [Illustration: COURTYARD, REINDEER INN, BANBURY.]      OLD INNS.--The Reindeer, in Parson's Street, is probably older than any of  the houses before mentioned; the wooden gates are dated 1570, and have  inscribed on them the names Iohn Knight, Ihone Knight, David Horne. The  richly moulded ceiling and the fine panelling of the principal room, known  as the Globe Room, are of the style of the Italian renaissance, and above  the window is an inscription of the date 1570. The Unicorn Inn, in the  Market Place, and the adjoining house, at one time no doubt part of the  inn, belong to a later period; the massive wooden gates are carved with  the date 1648. The Old George (1614) seems to have formerly borne the name  of The George and Altarstone, from a supposed Roman altar dug up on the  site of the inn, and formerly exhibited in one of the rooms.    THE BARS.--The entrances to the town were formerly crossed by gates, or  bars, five in number. The North Bar, from which the present street is  named, stood near the tan-yard, southward of the corner of Warwick Road.  The Cole Bar closed the old Adderbury and Oxford Road, which entered the  town by way of New Land and Broad Street before the making of the turnpike  road. St. John's Bar closed the entrance from Chipping Norton, and stood  at the spot where Monument Street now enters South Bar. When the Bar was  destroyed its site was marked by an obelisk, long since removed, from  which Monument Street takes its name. Sugarford Bar stood in West Street,  close to where it is now crossed by the Shades, and the Bridge Gate stood  on the old bridge over the Cherwell. Not a vestige of any of the bars  remains.    THE MECHANICS' INSTITUTE, founded 1835, received the gift of its new  building in Marlborough Road in 1884. It has a general library and a  reference library and news and magazine rooms well suited to the  requirements of the day. There is an excellent replica of Herkomer's  portrait of the donor in the news room.    THE MUNICIPAL SCHOOL buildings adjoin the Institute, and are also in part  a gift to the town by the Right Hon. Sir Bernhard Samuelson (Parliamentary  representative of Banbury for 30 years). It is also a School of Science  and Art, with well equipped rooms for art study, and with good  laboratories and class rooms. The School of Science and Art was a  continuation of science and art classes which were among the earliest  started in the kingdom (1861). It shows a good record of work. The  buildings are well proportioned, and the doorways of the local (Hornton)  stone are bold, and have good mouldings.    THE TOWN HALL.--The old Hall stood on the open space in the Market Place  in front of the Exchange Hall. It was a plain brick building, standing on  arcading, forming a Market Hall on the ground floor, and it has been  re-erected in Cherwell Street as a warehouse. The first Hall was built in  Queen Mary's reign, 1556. The Hall of to-day, built in 1853, was enlarged  in 1892. Portraits of Mr. Tancred, the late High Steward (Lord Saye and  Sele), and Aldermen Draper and Barford are hung in the Court Room.  Formerly a good painting by Hayn had a place there.    The Horton Infirmary, presented to the town by the late Miss Horton, of  Middleton Cheney, and her nephew, J. H. Horton, Esq., is on the Oxford  Road. Two Corn Exchanges existed in the Corn Hill and Market Place; one  has become an Inn with covered court yard, the other is used as a Theatre  but is also used for corn sales on Thursdays; Christ Church, St. John's  Priory and Church, the Wesleyan Chapels, and the various other  denominational places of worship, do not admit of full description.           *       *       *       *       *    BROUGHTON CASTLE, the old seat of Lord Saye and Sele, now the residence of  Lord Algernon Gordon Lennox, is about two and a half miles to the westward  of Banbury. The older parts are at the east end, and comprise a chapel,  several small rooms and groined passages, and an embattled and loopholed  tower, all of early decorated or 14th century work. The chapel contains a  geometrical window and stone altar. Both north and"]]]
