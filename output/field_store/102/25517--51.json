When one parent alone displays some  newly-acquired and generally inheritable character, and the offspring do  not inherit it, the cause may lie in the other parent having the power of  prepotent transmission. But when both parents are similarly characterised,  and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the character in  question, but resembles its grandparents, we have one of the simplest cases  of reversion. We continually see another and even more simple case of  atavism, though not generally included under this head, namely, when {29}  the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal grandsire in  some male attribute, as in any peculiarity in the beard of man, the horns  of the bull, the hackles or comb of the cock, or, as in certain diseases  necessarily confined to the male sex; for the mother cannot possess or  exhibit such male attributes, yet the child has inherited them, through her  blood, from his maternal grandsire.    The cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes, which,  however, in some instances, blend into each other; namely, first, those  occurring in a variety or race which has not been crossed, but has lost by  variation some character that it formerly possessed, and which afterwards  reappears. The second class includes all cases in which a distinguishable  individual, sub-variety, race, or species, has at some former period been  crossed with a distinct form, and a character derived from this cross,  after having disappeared during one or several generations, suddenly  reappears. A third class, differing only in the manner of reproduction,  might be formed to include all cases of reversion effected by means of  buds, and therefore independent of true or seminal generation. Perhaps even  a fourth class might be instituted, to include reversions by segments in  the same individual flower or fruit, and in different parts of the body in  the same individual animal as it grows old. But the two first main classes  will be sufficient for our purpose.           *       *       *       *       *    _Reversion to lost Characters by pure or uncrossed forms._--Striking  instances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth chapter,  namely, of the occasional reappearance, in variously-coloured pure breeds  of the pigeon, of blue birds with all the marks which characterise the wild  _Columba livia_. Similar cases were given in the case of the fowl. With the  common ass, as we now know that the legs of the wild progenitor are  striped, we may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such stripes  in the domestic animal is a case of simple reversion. But I shall be  compelled to refer again to these cases, and therefore will here pass them  over.    The aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are  descended, no doubt possessed horns; but several hornless breeds are now  well established. Yet in these--for instance, {30} in Southdown sheep--\"it  is not unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns.\" The  horns, which thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds, either  \"grow to the full size, or are curiously attached to the skin alone and  hang loosely down, or drop off.\"[66] The Galloways and Suffolk cattle have  been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned calf, with the  horn often loosely attached, is occasionally born.[67]    There is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated condition  were \"brown or dingy black;\" but even in the time of David certain flocks  were spoken of as white as snow. During the classical period the sheep of  Spain are described by several ancient authors as being black, red, or  tawny.[68] At the present day, notwithstanding the great care which is  taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and some entirely black are  occasionally dropped by our most highly improved and valued breeds, such as  the Southdowns. Since the time of the famous Bakewell, during the last  century, the Leicester sheep have been bred with the most scrupulous care;  yet occasionally grey-faced, or black-spotted, or wholly black lambs  appear.[69] This occurs still more frequently with the less improved  breeds, such as the Norfolks.[70] As bearing on this tendency in sheep to  revert to dark colours, I may state (though in doing so I trench on the  reversion of crossed breeds, and likewise on the subject of prepotency)  that the Rev. W. D. Fox was informed that seven white Southdown ewes were  put to a so-called Spanish ram, which had two small black spots on his  sides, and they produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox  believes that this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and  which is always spotted with black and white; and he finds that Leicester  sheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs: he has gone  on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white Leicesters during three  successive {31} generations, but always with the same result. Mr. Fox was  also told by the friend from whom the spotted breed was procured, that he  likewise had gone on for six or seven generations crossing with white  sheep, but still black lambs were invariably produced.    Similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various  animals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt[71] states that chickens bred from some  Rumpless fowls, which were reckoned so good that they won a prize at an  exhibition, \"in a considerable number of instances were furnished with  fully developed tail-feathers.\" On inquiry, the original breeder of these  fowls stated that, from the time when he had first kept them, they had  often produced fowls furnished with tails; but that these latter would  again reproduce rumpless chickens.    Analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom; thus \"from  seeds gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of Heartsease (_Viola  tricolor_), plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and their flowers  are frequently produced;\"[72] but the reversion in this instance is not to  a very ancient period, for the best existing varieties of the heartsease  are of comparatively modern origin. With most of our cultivated vegetables  there is some tendency to reversion to what is known to be, or may be  presumed to be, their aboriginal state; and this would be more evident if  gardeners did not generally look over their beds of seedlings, and pull up  the false plants or \"rogues\" as they are called. It has already been  remarked, that some few seedling apples and pears generally resemble, but  apparently are not identical with, the wild trees from which they are  descended. In our turnip[73] and carrot-beds a few plants often  \"break\"--that is, flower too soon; and their roots are generally found to  be hard and stringy, as in the parent-species. By the aid of a little  selection, carried on during a few generations, most of our cultivated  plants could probably be brought back, without any great change in their  conditions of life, to a wild or nearly wild condition: Mr. Buckman has  effected this with the parsnip;[74] {32} and Mr. Hewett C. Watson, as he  informs me, selected, during three generations, \"the most diverging plants  of Scotch kail, perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage;  and in the third generation some of the plants came very close to the forms  now established in England about old castle-walls, and called indigenous.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Reversion in Animals and Plants which have run wild._--In the cases  hitherto considered, the reverting animals and plants have not been exposed  to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which could have  induced this tendency; but it is very different with animals and plants  which have become feral or run wild. It has been repeatedly asserted in the  most positive manner by various authors, that feral animals and plants  invariably return to their primitive specific type. It is curious on what  little evidence this belief rests. Many of our domesticated animals could  not subsist in a wild state; thus, the more highly improved breeds of the  pigeon will not \"field\" or search for their own food. Sheep have never  become feral, and would be destroyed by almost every beast of prey. In  several cases we do not know the aboriginal parent-species, and cannot  possibly tell whether or not there has been any close degree of reversion.  It is not known in any instance what variety was first turned out; several  varieties have probably in some cases run wild, and their crossing alone  would tend to obliterate their proper character. Our domesticated animals  and plants, when they run wild, must always be exposed to new conditions of  life, for, as Mr. Wallace[75] has well remarked, they have to obtain their  own food, and are exposed to competition with the native productions. Under  these circumstances, if our domesticated animals did not undergo change of  some kind, the result would be quite opposed to the conclusions arrived at  in this work. Nevertheless, I do not doubt that the simple fact of animals  and plants becoming feral, does cause some tendency to reversion to the  primitive state; though this tendency has been much exaggerated by some  authors.    {33}        I will briefly run through the recorded cases. With neither horses nor      cattle is the primitive stock known; and it has been shown in former      chapters that they have assumed different colours in different      countries. Thus the horses which have run wild in South America are      generally brownish-bay, and in the East dun-coloured; their heads have      become larger and coarser, and this may be due to reversion."]]]
