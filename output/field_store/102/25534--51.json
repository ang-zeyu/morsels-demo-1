In an instant the white countenances of the lads were changed to  black--as black as the burnt-cork performers in a minstrel show. Then  came a series of howls.    \"Wow! Who did that!\"    \"I'm blinded! The shed is falling down!\"    \"Run fellows, run!\" screamed Andy. \"There's been an explosion. We'll be  killed!\"    At that moment the big doors of the shed were thrown open, and Mr.  Sharp came in. He started back in astonishment at the sight of the  three grotesque figures, their faces black with the soot, and their  clothes covered with sawdust and shavings, rushing wildly around.    \"That will teach you to come meddling around here. Andy Foger!\" cried  Tom.    \"I--I--you--you--Oh, wait--I--you--\" spluttered the bully, almost  speechless with rage. Sam and Pete were wildly trying to wipe the stuff  from their faces, but only made matters worse. They were so startled  that they did not know enough to run out of the opened doors.    \"Wish we had some more stuff to put on 'em,\" remarked Ned, who was  holding his sides that ached from laughter.    \"I have it!\" cried Tom, and he caught up a bucket of red paint, that  had been used to give the airship its brilliant hue. Running to the end  of the loft Tom stood for an instant over the trio of lads who were  threatening and imploring by 'turns.    \"Here's another souvenir of your visit,\" shouted the young inventor, as  he dashed the bucket of red paint down on the conspirators. This  completed the work of the dirt and soot, and a few seconds later, each  face looking like a stage Indian's ready for the war-path, the trio  dashed out. They shed shavings, sawdust and lampblack at every step,  and from their clothes and hands and faces dripped the carmine paint.    \"Better have your pictures taken!\" cried Ned, peering from an upper  window.    \"Yes, and send us one,\" added Tom, joining his chum. Andy looked up at  them. He dug a mass of red paint from his left ear, removed a mass of  soot from his right cheek, and, shaking his fist, which was alternately  striped red and black, cried out in a rage:    \"I'll get even with you yet, Tom Swift!\"    \"You only got what was coming to you,\" retorted the young inventor.  \"The next time you come sneaking around this airship, trying to damage  it, you'll get worse, and I'll have you arrested. You've had your  lesson, and don't forget it.\"    The red-haired bully, doubly red-haired now, had nothing more to say.  There was nothing he could say, and, accompanied by his companions, he  made a bee-line for the rear gate in the fence, and darted across the  meadow. They were all sorry enough looking specimens, but solely  through their own fault.          Chapter 8    Winning a Prize      \"Well, Tom, what happened?\" asked Mr. Sharp, as he saw the trio running  away. \"Looks as if you had had an exciting time here.\"    \"No, those fellows had all the excitement,\" declared Ned. \"We had the  fun.\" And the two lads proceeded to relate what had taken place.    \"Tried to damage the airship, eh?\" asked Mr. Sharp. \"I wish I'd caught  them at it; the scoundrels! But perhaps you handled them as well as I  could have done.\"    \"I guess so,\" assented Tom. \"I must see if they did cut any of the  wires.\"    But the young inventor and his chum had acted too quickly, and it was  found that nothing had been done to the Red Cloud.    A little later the airship was taken out of the shed, and made ready  for a trip. The gas ascension was first used, and Ned and Mr. Swift  were passengers with Tom and Mr. Sharp. The machine went about a  thousand feet up in the air, and then was sent in various directions,  to the no small delight of a large crowd that gathered in the meadow  back of the Swift property; for it only required the sight of the  airship looming its bulk above the fence and buildings, to attract a  throng. It is safe to say this time, however, that Andy Foger and his  cronies were not in the audience. They were probably too busy removing  the soot and red paint.    Although it was the first time Mr. Swift had ever been in an airship,  he evinced no great astonishment. In fact he seemed to be thinking  deeply, and on some subject not connected with aeronautics. Tom noticed  the abstraction of his father, and shook his head. Clearly the aged  inventor was not his usual self.    As for Ned Newton his delight knew no bounds, At first he was a bit  apprehensive as the big ship went higher and higher, and swung about,  but he soon lost his fear, and enjoyed the experience as much as did  Tom. The young inventor was busy helping Mr. Sharp manage the  machinery, rudders-planes and motor.    A flight of several miles was made, and Tom was wishing they might pay  another visit to the Rocksmond Seminary, but Mr. Sharp, after  completing several evolutions, designed to test the steering qualities  of the craft, put back home.    \"We'll land in the meadow and try rising by the planes alone,\" he said.  In this evolution it was deemed best for Mr. Swift and Ned to alight,  as there was no telling just how the craft would behave. Tom's father  was very willing to get out, but Ned would have remained in, only for  the desire of his friend.    With the two propellers whirring at a tremendous speed, and all the gas  out of the aluminum container, the Red Cloud shot forward, running over  the level ground of the meadow, where a starting course had been laid  out.    \"Clear the track!\" cried Mr. Sharp, as he saw the crowd closing up in  front of him. The men, boys, several girls and women made a living  lane. Through this shot the craft, and then, when sufficient momentum  had been obtained, Tom, at a command from the aeronaut, pulled the  lever of the elevation rudder. Up into the air shot the nose of the Red  Cloud as the wind struck the slanting surface of the planes, and, a  moment later it was sailing high above the heads of the throng.    \"That's the stuff!\" cried Mr. Sharp. \"It works as well that way as it  does with the gas!\"    Higher and higher it went, and then, coming to a level keel, the craft  was sent here and there, darting about like a bird, and going about in  huge circles.    \"Start the gas machine, and we'll come to rest in the air,\" said the  balloonist, and Tom did so. As the powerful vapor filled the container  the ship acquired a buoyancy, and there was no need of going at high  speed in order to sustain it. The propellers were stopped, and the Red  Cloud floated two thousand feet in the air, only a little distance  below some fleecy, white masses from which she took her name. The  demonstration was a great success. The gas was again allowed to escape,  the propellers set in motion, and purely as an aeroplane, the ship was  again sent forward. By means of the planes and rudders a perfect  landing was made in the meadow, a short distance from where the start  had been made. The crowd cheered the plucky youth and Mr. Sharp.    \"Now I'm ready to go on a long trip any time you are, Tom,\" said the  aeronaut that night.    \"We'll fit up the car and get ready,\" agreed the 'youth. \"How about  you, dad?\"    \"Me? Oh, well--er--that is, you see; well, I'll think about it,\" and  Mr. Swift went to his own room, carrying with him a package of papers,  containing intricate calculations.    Tom shook his head, but said nothing. He could not understand his  father's conduct.    Work was started the next day on fitting up the car, or cabin, of the  airship, so that several persons could live, eat and sleep in it for  two weeks, if necessary. The third day after this task had been  commenced the mail brought an unusual communication to Tom and Mr.  Sharp. It was from an aero club of Blakeville, a city distant about a  hundred miles, and stated that a competition for aeroplanes and  dirigible balloons was to be held in the course of two weeks. The  affair was designed to further interest in the sport, and also to  demonstrate what progress had been made in the art of conquering the  air. Prizes were to be given, and the inventors of the Red Cloud, the  achievements of which the committee of arrangements had heard, were  invited to compete.    \"Shall we go in for it, Tom?\" asked the balloonist.    \"I'm willing if you are.\"    \"Then let's do it. We'll see how our craft shows up alongside of  others. I know something of this club. It is all right, but the  carnival is likely to be a small one. Once I gave a balloon exhibition  for them. The managers are all right. Well, we'll have a try at it.  Won't do us any harm to win a prize. Then for a long trip!\"    As it was not necessary to have the car, or cabin, completely fitted up  in order to compete for the prize, work in that direction was suspended  for the time being, and more attention was paid to the engine, the  planes and rudders. Some changes were made and, a week later the Red  Cloud departed for Blakeville. As the rules of the contest required  three passengers, Ned Newton was taken along, Mr. Swift having arranged  with the bank president so that the lad could have a few days off.    The Red Cloud arrived at the carnival grounds in the evening, having  been delayed on the trip by a broken cog wheel, which was mended in  mid-air. As the three navigators approached, they saw a small machine  flying around the grounds.    \"Look!\" cried Ned excitedly. \"What a small airship.\"    \"That's a monoplane,\" declared Tom, who was getting to be quite an  expert.    \"Yes, the same kind that was used to cross the English Channel,\"  interjected Mr. Sharp. \"They're too uncertain for my purposes, though;  they are all right under certain conditions.\"    Hardly had he spoken than a puff of wind caused the daring manipulator  of the monoplane to swerve to one side. He had to make a quick  descent--so rapid was it, in fact, that the tips of one of his planes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],[0,"Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#9)"],[1," carborundum or  emery will be ample. The beginner usually grinds too much, and with too  coarse material. As the grinding surface becomes dry, water is added  drop by drop, and the grinding continued until the abrasive seems to be  reduced to an impalpable powder, most of which has been squeezed out of  the stopcock. The two surfaces in the stopcock are usually grinding upon  each other at this stage, and inspection will show whether the contact  between them is uniformly good. If not, the grinding must be continued  with a little fresh abrasive. If contact appears to be good, the  surfaces are ground together for a little with practically no abrasive,  so as to polish them, and the joint is then washed out and tested.    In grinding in a new plug to replace a broken one, the plug selected  should have practically the same taper as the seat into which it is to  be ground, and should be a very little too large. Care must be taken to  so distribute the abrasive material as to grind mostly on the places  where the plug fits tightly.    =Sealing on a New Tube.=--It frequently happens that one of the tubes of  the stopcock is broken off close to the cock itself, and a new one must  be joined to the stub of the old one. With care, this may often be  successfully done even where the break is within 1/4 inch of the  stopcock. The first step is to clean and dry the stopcock, remove the  plug, cork the open ends of the stopcock sleeve and the other tube, and  wind a couple of layers of asbestos cord carefully over the sleeve and  the most of the corks which close it. A suitable tube, having as near as  possible the same diameter and wall strength as the one broken off, is  selected and a piece the desired length cut off. The broken end of the  tube on the stopcock is now squared off as well as possible, by cutting  or by heating and drawing off the projections, and the new tube sealed  on, usually with the first method (Exercise No. 1). If the break is very  close to the stopcock, very little reheating and blowing can be done, on  account of the danger of getting the stopcock sleeve out of shape, and  the work must be heated very slowly to prevent cracking. The main  reliance is then placed on making a good joint when the tubes are  brought together, and then drawing out this joint a little, at once, to  get an even wall.      CLOSED CIRCUITS OF TUBING.    In some pieces of apparatus closed circuits of circular or rectangular  shape are required. A similar problem is involved in apparatus like the  ordinary Soxhlet extractor, where a small tube is joined to the side of  a large one, bent to form a siphon, and attached again to a continuation  of the original large tube. The difficulty in all such cases is to  provide for the contraction taking place as the last joint cools. If  part of the circuit has the shape of the letter S, or is a spiral, the  natural springiness of the glass will take care of this. If not, the  side of the circuit opposite to the joint and parallel to it must be  heated also, the two being finally heated together to the softening  point after the joint is completed, and then allowed to cool together.    To make the last joint, the rest of the tube is made in approximately  the desired form, the two pieces which are to be joined to make the last  joint being just enough out of the desired position to allow them to  pass one another. The final joint is preferably made in the middle of a  straight piece of tube, not at a tee. The two pieces which are to be  joined are bent so as to just pass each other, marked at the right point  with the glass-knife, and cut there, preferably with a small bead of hot  glass. One or both of these tubes are now warmed to the softening point  in such a place that the tubes can be made to meet properly, and the two  cut ends pressed together. They are now warmed in the flame, and joined  together, either by simultaneously warming the opposite side of the  circuit or some other suitable part, so as to allow the two ends to be  pushed together again after they are softened, or by gently touching the  places that do not unite with a hot bead of glass, and using the glass  to fill up the crack where the ends do not quite meet. Care must be  taken not to leave knots or lumps of glass in the finished joint, and  the latter should be well reblown, and if necessary left as a small bulb  or enlargement, rather than have it have too thick walls.      SPIRALS        Spirals of glass tubing are probably best made free-hand before the  blow-pipe, unless one has a great many of them to make, and extreme  accuracy is desired. To begin with, a piece of tubing of the desired  size (say 3/16 inch in diameter) and a convenient length (about two  feet) is selected, one end closed, and a right-angle bend made about six  inches from the closed end. Holding the closed end in the left hand and  the long open one in the right, the spiral is begun. The short closed  end is to be parallel to the axis of the spiral, and preferably in that  axis. Using a moderate-sized flame, of somewhat yellow color, and taking  care to heat the whole circumference of the tube, the long open end is  wound little by little into a spiral having the short end _a_ (Fig. 16)  as an axis. The bend at _b_, where the tube changes from the radius to  the circumference of the circle, must be rather short, but the tube must  not be flattened or constricted here. Especial pains is to be taken  with the first turn of the spiral (_b_ to _c_, Fig. 16), as the shape of  this determines the diameter of the whole spiral, and serves as a guide  for the rest of the turns. The winding of the tube is best accomplished,  after a portion has been softened, by slowly turning the short end _a_ a  little about its own axis, while the long open end remains where it was.  This winds the tube into a spiral, just as if there were a solid  cylinder in the center of it, and this cylinder was being turned about  its axis, and was winding up the soft glass upon its circumference. As  the cylinder is not actually there, the curve of the turns must be  carefully estimated by the eye, so that the spiral may be uniform and  moderately smooth. When the original piece of tube has been used up,  another piece is sealed on to the open end, and the operation continued  as far as may be required.    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Making a spiral.]      GROUND JOINTS    It is sometimes required to join two pieces of tubing end to end, by  means of a ground joint. Whenever possible, a regular sealed joint  should be used instead of this ground joint, as it is quicker to make,  and more certain to be tight. Where a ground joint is necessary,  however, it is best made in the conical form shown in _c_, Fig. 17. If  the wall of the tube to be used is not very thick, it is thickened by  collecting glass as for a bulb on the ends of two tubes (Exercise No.  6), and drawing to form cones of suitable shape (_a_ and _b_, Fig. 17)  and of such relative sizes that a will slip about half way into _b_. In  order to make _a_ straight and give it the proper angle, it may be  rolled when hot, upon a hot plate of carbon. Blowing during this rolling  is often helpful to remove depressions. After _b_ has been drawn to  nearly the proper size and shape, it may be smoothed by the use of a  small carbon rod, held inside it at a slight angle, or better by the use  of a truncated hexagonal pyramid of carbon, whose edges have the proper  slant to make the inside of the cone right. The proper taper for both  these cones is the same as that used in stopcocks of similar size. The  hexagonal carbon can easily be made by carefully filing down an electric  light carbon, and finally impregnating it with paraffin or beeswax, and  is extremely useful wherever a conical surface has to be formed from the  inside of a tube.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Ground joint.]    The tail is allowed to remain on piece _a_, as a sort of guide in  grinding, and should therefore be in the axis of the tube and have  rather thick walls. Grind with emery or carborundum, as described under  a previous head. (Regrinding plug for stopcock.) If many such joints are  to be made, it will pay to have a little sleeve of brass made with the  proper taper, and rough down the plug _a_ in it to about the proper  size, while _b_ is roughed down by means of a brass or iron plug having  the same taper. This prevents excessive grinding of one-half of the  joint in order to remove a defect in the other half, and is the method  commercially used in making stopcocks.      SEALING IN PLATINUM WIRE    Very often it is necessary to seal platinum wire into the wall of a  tube. Professional glass-blowers usually use a special sort of glass  (\"Einschmelzglas\") which is usually a lead glass, and is made of such  composition that it has the same or practically the same coefficient of  expansion as platinum. A little globule of this glass is sealed into the  tube in such a way that it joins the platinum to the glass of the tube.  To do this, the small globule of special glass is fused on the platinum  wire at the proper point and the tube into which the wire is to be  sealed is heated and a small tail drawn out at the point where the wire  is to be inserted. The lump of the special glass should be from 3/32 to  1/8 inch in diameter, and the tail drawn on the tube should have a  slightly less diameter at the point (about 1/8 inch or less from the  tube) where it is cut off. There are now two ways of sealing in the  wire. (1) The wire with the globule of glass is placed inside the tube  and the latter revolved until the end of the wire sticks out of the cut  tail (_a_, Fig. 18). The latter is now gently heated, and the two glass  surfaces fused together, taking care to use only the end of the hissing  flame, if the special glass contains lead. (See Chapter I, page 1.) The  whole circumference of the tube is then heated and annealed carefully.  (2"]]]
