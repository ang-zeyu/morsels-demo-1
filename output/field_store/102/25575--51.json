The two things that kept me living were  pride and hate. I left my scrubbing of floors to practice arms with the  young boys. I was beaten for it every day, but every day I went. I knew  even then that only force would free me. And my father was a king's son,  a good man of his hands. His blood was strong in me. I learned.\"    She held her head very high. She had earned the right to hold it so. She  finished quietly,    \"I have come a long way. I will not turn back now.\"    \"Ciara.\" Stark came and stood before her. \"I am talking to you as a  fighting man, an equal. There may be power behind the Gates of Death, I  do not know. But this I have seen--madness, horror, an evil that is  beyond our understanding.    \"I think you will not accuse me of cowardice. And yet I would not go  into that pass for all the power of all the kings of Mars!\"    Once started, he could not stop. The full force of that dark vision of  the talisman swept over him again in memory. He came closer to her,  driven by the need to make her understand.    \"Yes, I have the talisman! And I have had a taste of its purpose. I  think Ban Cruach left it as a warning, so that none would follow him. I  have seen the temples and the palaces glitter in the ice. I have seen  the Gates of Death--_not with my own eyes, Ciara, but with his. With the  eyes and the memories of Ban Cruach!_\"    He had caught her again, his hands strong on her strong arms.    \"Will you believe me, or must you see for yourself--the dreadful things  that walk those buried streets, the shapes that rise from nowhere in the  mists of the pass?\"    Her gaze burned into his. Her breath was hot and sweet upon his lips,  and she was like a sword between his hands, shining and unafraid.    \"Give me the talisman. Let me see!\"    He answered furiously, \"You are mad. As mad as Otar.\" And he kissed her,  in a rage, in a panic lest all that beauty be destroyed--a kiss as  brutal as a blow, that left him shaken.           *       *       *       *       *    She backed away slowly, one step, and he thought she would have killed  him. He said heavily:    \"If you will see, you will. The thing is here.\"    He opened the boss and laid the crystal in her outstretched hand. He did  not meet her eyes.    \"Sit down. Hold the flat side against your brow.\"    She sat, in a great chair of carven wood. Stark noticed that her hand  was unsteady, her face the colour of white ash. He was glad she did not  have the axe where she could reach it. She did not play at anger.    For a long moment she studied the intricate lens, the incredible  depository of a man's mind. Then she raised it slowly to her forehead.    He saw her grow rigid in the chair. How long he watched beside her he  never knew. Seconds, an eternity. He saw her eyes turn blank and  strange, and a shadow came into her face, changing it subtly, altering  the lines, so that it seemed almost a stranger was peering through her  flesh.    All at once, in a voice that was not her own, she cried out terribly,  \"_Oh gods of Mars!_\"    The talisman dropped rolling to the floor, and Ciara fell forward into  Stark's arms.    He thought at first that she was dead. He carried her to the bed, in an  agony of fear that surprised him with its violence, and laid her down,  and put his hand over her heart.    It was beating strongly. Relief that was almost a sickness swept over  him. He turned, searching vaguely for wine, and saw the talisman. He  picked it up and put it back inside the boss. A jewelled flagon stood on  a table across the room. He took it and started back, and then,  abruptly, there was a wild clamor in the hall outside and Otar was  shouting Ciara's name, pounding on the door.    It was not barred. In another moment they would burst through, and he  knew that they would not stop to enquire what he was doing there.    He dropped the flagon and went out swiftly, the way he had come. The  guard was still unconscious. In the narrow hall beyond, Stark hesitated.  A woman's voice was rising high above the tumult in the main corridor,  and he thought he recognized it.    He went to the tapestry curtain and looked for the second time around  its edge.    The lofty space was full of men, newly wakened from their heavy sleep  and as nervous as so many bears. Thanis struggled in the grip of two of  them. Her scarlet kirtle was torn, her hair flying in wild elf-locks,  and her face was the face of a mad thing. The whole story of the doom of  Kushat was written large upon it.    She screamed again and again, and would not be silenced.    \"Tell her, the witch that leads you! Tell her that she is already doomed  to death, with all her army!\"    Otar opened up the door of Ciara's room.    Thanis surged forward. She must have fled through all that castle before  she was caught, and Stark's heart ached for her.    \"You!\" she shrieked through the doorway, and poured out all the filth of  the quarter upon Ciara's name. \"Balin has gone to bring doom upon you!  He will open wide the Gates of Death, and then you will  die!--die!--_die!_\"    Stark felt the shock of a terrible dread, as he let the curtain fall.  Mad with hatred against conquerors, Balin had fulfilled his raging  promise and had gone to fling open the Gates of Death.    Remembering his nightmare vision of the shining, evil ones whom Ban  Cruach had long ago prisoned beyond those gates, Stark felt a sickness  grow within him as he went down the stair and out the postern door.    It was almost dawn. He looked up at the brooding cliffs, and it seemed  to him that the wind in the pass had a sound of laughter that mocked his  growing dread.    He knew what he must do, if an ancient, mysterious horror was not to be  released upon Kushat.    _I may still catch Balin before he has gone too far! If I don't--_    He dared not think of that. He began to walk very swiftly through the  night streets, toward the distant, towering Gates of Death.          VII      It was past noon. He had climbed high toward the saddle of the pass.  Kushat lay small below him, and he could see now the pattern of the  gorges, cut ages deep in the living rock, that carried the spring  torrents of the watershed around the mighty ledge on which the city was  built.    The pass itself was channeled, but only by its own snows and melting  ice. It was too high for a watercourse. Nevertheless, Stark thought, a  man might find it hard to stay alive if he were caught there by the  thaw.    He had seen nothing of Balin. The gods knew how many hours' start he  had. Stark imagined him, scrambling wild-eyed over the rocks, driven by  the same madness that had sent Thanis up into the castle to call down  destruction on Ciara's head.    The sun was brilliant but without warmth. Stark shivered, and the icy  wind blew strong. The cliffs hung over him, vast and sheer and crushing,  and the narrow mouth of the pass was before him. He would go no farther.  He would turn back, now.    But he did not. He began to walk forward, into the Gates of Death.    _The light was dim and strange at the bottom of that cleft. Little veils  of mist crept and clung between the ice and the rock, thickened, became  more dense as he went farther and farther into the pass. He could not  see, and the wind spoke with many tongues, piping in the crevices of the  cliffs._    The steps of the Earthman slowed and faltered. He had known fear in his  life before. But now he was carrying the burden of two men's  terrors--Ban Cruach's, and his own.    He stopped, enveloped in the clinging mist. He tried to reason with  himself--that Ban Cruach's fears had died a million years ago, that Otar  had come this way and lived, and Balin had come also.    But the thin veneer of civilization sloughed away and left him with the  naked bones of truth. His nostrils twitched to the smell of evil, the  subtle unclean taint that only a beast, or one as close to it as he, can  sense and know. Every nerve was a point of pain, raw with apprehension.  An overpowering recognition of danger, hidden somewhere, mocking at him,  made his very body change, draw in upon itself and flatten forward, so  that when at last he went on again he was more like a four-footed thing  than a man walking upright.    Infinitely wary, silent, moving surely over the ice and the tumbled  rock, he followed Balin. He had ceased to think. He was going now on  sheer instinct.    The pass led on and on. It grew darker, and in the dim uncanny twilight  there were looming shapes that menaced him, and ghostly wings that  brushed him, and a terrible stillness that was not broken by the eerie  voices of the wind.    Rock and mist and ice. Nothing that moved or lived. And yet the sense of  danger deepened, and when he paused the beating of his heart was like  thunder in his ears.    Once, far away, he thought he heard the echoes of a man's voice crying,  but he had no sight of Balin.    The pass began to drop, and the twilight deepened into a kind of sickly  night.    On and down, more slowly now, crouching, slinking, heavily oppressed,  tempted to snarl at boulders and tear at wraiths of fog. He had no idea  of the miles he had travelled. But the ice was thicker now, the cold  intense.    The rock walls broke off sharply. The mist thinned. The pallid darkness  lifted to a clear twilight. He came to the end of the Gates of Death.    Stark stopped. Ahead of him, almost blocking the end of the pass,  something dark and high and massive loomed in the thinning mists.    It was a great cairn, and upon it sat a figure, facing outward from the  Gates of Death as though it kept watch over whatever country lay beyond.    The figure of a man in antique Martian armor.    After a moment, Stark crept toward the cairn. He was still almost all  savage, torn between fear and fascination.    He was forced to scramble over the lower rocks of the cairn itself.

Phelps and Zieber were satisfied that it would work. I had no       money. Zieber offered forty dollars to build a model machine.       Phelps offered his best endeavors to carry out my plan and make the       model in his shop; if successful we were to share equally. I worked       at it day and night, sleeping but three or four hours a day out of       the twenty-four, and eating generally but once a day, as I knew I       must make it for the forty dollars or not get it at all.         The machine was completed in eleven days. About nine o'clock in the       evening we got the parts together and tried it; it did not sew; the       workmen exhausted with almost unremitting work, pronounced it a       failure and left me one by one.         Zieber held the lamp, and I continued to try the machine, but       anxiety and incessant work had made me nervous and I could not get       tight stitches. Sick at heart, about midnight, we started for our       hotel. On the way we sat down on a pile of boards, and Zieber       mentioned that the loose loops of thread were on the upper side of       the cloth. It flashed upon me that we had forgot to adjust the       tension on the needle thread. We went back, adjusted the tension,       tried the machine, sewed five stitches perfectly and the thread       snapped, but that was enough. At three o'clock the next day the       machine was finished. I took it to New York and employed Mr.       Charles M. Keller to patent it. It was used as a model in the       application for the patent.[53]    The first machine was completed about the last of September 1850. The  partners considered naming the machine the \"Jenny Lind,\" after the  Swedish soprano who was then the toast of America. It was reported[54]  to have been advertised under that name when the machine was first  placed on the market, but the name was soon changed to \"Singer's  Perpendicular Action Sewing Machine\" or simply the \"Singer Sewing  Machine\"--a name correctly anticipated to achieve a popularity of its  own.    According to the contract made by the partners, the hurriedly built  first machine was to be sent to the Patent Office with an application in  the name of Singer and Phelps. An application was made between the end  of September 1850 and March 14, 1851, as Singer refers to it briefly in  the application formally filed on April 16, 1851, stating, \"My present  invention is of improvements on a machine heretofore invented by me and  for which an application is now pending.\"[55]    [Illustration: Figure 28.--SINGER'S PATENT MODEL, 1851; a commercial  machine was used, bearing the serial number 22. (Smithsonian photo  45572-D.)]    In late December 1850 Singer had bought Phelps' interest in the company.  Whether the first application was later abandoned by Singer or whether  it was rejected is not known,[56] but a patent on the first application  was never issued. The final disposition of this first machine has  remained a mystery.[57]    [Illustration: Figure 29.--SINGER'S PERPENDICULAR ACTION sewing machine,  an engraving from _Illustrated News_, June 25, 1853, which states: \"The  sewing machine has, within the last two years acquired a wide celebrity,  and established its character as one of the most efficient labor saving  instruments ever introduced to public notice.... We must not forget to  call attention to the fact that this instrument is peculiarly calculated  for female operatives. They should never allow its use to be monopolized  by men.\" (Smithsonian photo 48091-D.)]    A few machines were manufactured in late 1850 and early 1851, and these  attracted considerable attention; orders began to be received in advance  of production. The pending patent application did not delay the  manufacture, and a number of machines were sold before August 12, 1851,  when the patent was granted. The patent model is shown in figure 28.[58]  It made a lockstitch by means of a straight eye-pointed needle and a  reciprocating shuttle. The patent claims, as quoted from the  specifications, were as follows:         1. Giving to the shuttle an additional forward motion after it has       been stopped to close the loop, as described, for the purpose of       drawing the stitch tight, when such additional motion is given at       and in combination with the feed motion of the cloth in the reverse       direction, and the final upward motion of the needle, as described,       so that the two threads shall be drawn tight at the same time, as       described.         2. Controlling the thread during the downward motion of the needle       by the combination of a friction-pad to prevent the slack above the       cloth, with the eye on the needle-carrier for drawing back the       thread, for the purposes and in the manner substantially as       described.         3. Placing the bobbin from which the needle is supplied with thread       on an adjustable arm attached to the frame, substantially as       described, when this is combined with the carrying of the said       thread through an eye or guide attached to and moving with the       needle-carrier, as described, whereby any desired length of thread       can be given for the formation of the loop without varying the       range of motion of the needle, as described.    The feeding described in the Singer patent was \"by the friction surface  of a wheel, whose periphery is formed with very fine grooves, the edges  of which are slightly serrated, against which the cloth is pressed by a  spring plate or pad.\" Although claimed by the inventor in the  handwritten specifications, it was not allowed as original.    The machines manufactured by the Singer company (fig. 29) were  duplicates of the patent model. These machines were quite heavy and  intended for manufacturing rather than for family use in the home.    [Illustration: Figure 30.--I. M. SINGER & CO. NEW YORK SHOWROOM of the  mid-1850s, as illustrated in _Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper_,  August 29, 1857; only manufacturing machines are shown in this  illustration. (Smithsonian photo 48091-B.)]    [Illustration: Figure 31.--HUNT AND WEBSTER'S SEWING-MACHINE MANUFACTORY  exhibition and salesroom in Boston, as illustrated in _Ballou's  Pictorial_, July 5, 1856; only manufacturing machines are shown.  (Smithsonian photo 45771-A.)]    Singer enjoyed demonstrating the machine and showed it to church and  social groups and even at circuses; this personal association then  encouraged him to improve its reliability and convenience. He developed  a wooden packing case which doubled as a stand for the machine and a  treadle to allow it to be operated by foot. Because of the dimensions of  the packing case, Singer put the pivot of the treadle toward its center,  about where the instep of the foot would rest. This produced the  heel-and-toe action treadle, a familiar part of the sewing machine until  its replacement by the electric motor. Both hands were freed to guide  and arrange the cloth that was being stitched. Singer also added a  flywheel to smooth out the treadle action and later an iron stand with a  treadle wide enough for both feet. The treadle had been in use for two  years before a rival pointed out that it might have been patented. To  Singer's chagrin it was then too late for patent laws did not permit  patenting a device that had been in public use.    A new obstacle appeared in the Singer company's path when Howe demanded  $25,000 for infringement of his patent. Singer and Zieber decided to  fight, enlisting the legal aid of Edward Clark, a lawyer and financier.  Howe's action was opposed on the basis of Hunt's machine of 1834, which  they stated had anticipated Howe's invention.    While they were resisting, Howe sued three firms that were using and  selling Singer machines. The court order required the selling firms and  the purchasers to provide an account of the profits accrued from the  sale and the use of the sewing machines and restrained the firms from  selling the machines during the pendency of the suit.[59] As a result of  this action, a number of Singer's rivals purchased licenses from Howe  and advertised that anyone could sell their machines without fear of a  suit. This gave them a great competitive advantage, and Singer and  Clark[60] decided it was best to seek a settlement with Howe. On July 1,  1854, they paid him $15,000 and took out a license.    [Illustration: Figure 32.--SINGER'S NEW FAMILY SEWING MACHINE,  illustration from a brochure dating about 1858 or 1859 which states: \"A  few months since, we came to the conclusion that the public taste  demanded a sewing machine for family purposes more exclusively; a  machine of smaller size, and of a lighter and more elegant form; a  machine decorated in the best style of art, so as to make a beautiful  ornament in the parlor or boudoir; a machine very easily operated, and  rapid in working.... To supply this public want, we have just produced,  and are now prepared to receive orders for, 'Singer's new Family Sewing  Machine.'\" (Smithsonian photo 48091-H.)]    In spite of this defeat, the Singer company could claim several  important improvements to the sewing machine and the acquisition of the  patents rights to the Morey and Johnson machine of 1849, which gave them  control of the spring or curved arm to hold the cloth by a yielding  pressure. Although this point had not been claimed in the 1849 patent,  the established principle of patent law allowed that a novel device  introduced and used in a patented machine could be covered by a reissue  at any time during the life of the patent. Upon becoming owners of the  Morey and Johnson patent, Singer applied for a reissue which covered  this type of yielding"]]]
