The shells of the present genus bear such a general  resemblance to each other, and are so simple in their construction, that a  corresponding minuteness of discrimination is requisite to characterize the  species; I have, therefore, selected for this purpose the modification of  the upper margin to which the ligament is attached, and which in other  shells forms the bases of the teeth. This I have termed the hinge margin.  The form of the notch or sinus which terminates this part will also be  found of much importance in discriminating the species; for no shells vary  more in their form, thickness, or convexity than these do, according to  their locality, age, or other circumstances.    Shell transverse, oval; rather thick and ventricose; both extremities  obtuse; the anterior side (from the umbones to the exterior margin)  obliquely rounded; umbones prominent; hinge margin rather thick, slightly  curved, and swelled immediately under the umbones; sinus short, abrupt,  curved; epidermis coarse, black, and much wrinkled; inside stained with  yellow, and having a narrow reddish rim or margin.    For this species, now, I believe, first made known, I am indebted to G. C.  Bainbridge, Esq. of Liverpool, who received several specimens from the  United States. It appears to have been unknown to Mr. Say, who has  published an account of the land and river shells of North America.    The student might be led to suppose, that the two genera of _Unio_ and  _Anodon_ are strongly characterized; for the first includes many of the  most ponderous bivalves yet discovered, and the second some remarkably thin  and brittle. Among the _Uniones_ are shells furnished with hinges of the  greatest force, while most of the _Anodons_ are perfectly destitute of any;  nevertheless, the gradations by which these characters approach each other  are very remarkable, and some shells which partake of both have been  arranged in separate genera. Of these, the best defined are _Hyria_ Lam.  and _Dipsas_ of Leach; the one allied nearest to _Unio_, but having the  cardinal teeth assuming the appearance of lateral or lamellar teeth; the  other more resembling the Anodons, but furnished with a strongly defined  and elevated lamellar tooth, extending the whole length of the hinge.  Between these two genera should be placed another of Lamarck's, called by  him _Iridinia_, which has likewise only a simple lamellar plate, but broken  into a great number of crenated teeth. The observing Mr. Say has likewise  proposed another under the name of _Alasmodonta_, which, however, I shall  take another opportunity of noticing.    I have ventured to exchange the ungrammatical name of _Anodonta_, given by  Bruguiere to this genus, for _Anodon_, at the suggestion of the learned Dr.  Goodall, Provost of Eton College.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 97    [Illustration]    MARGINELLA,    _Date Shell._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa ovata.

Generic Types _Vol. perspicula, glabella, prunum, &c._ Lin.           *       *       *       *       *    Lamarck first separated the shells comprised in this genus from the Volutes  of Linnaeus; their principal distinction rests in the formation of the  outer lip, which has a very thick margin, more or less toothed on the inner  rim; the base likewise is nearly entire, and the inner lip quite wanting.    By these peculiarities, the _Date Shells_ are easily known from the  _Volutes_ on the one hand, and the _Cowries_ on the other; and the  invaluable researches of M. Adanson, who has described and figured the  animals of each of these genera, has established this distinction on the  most solid principles; it will, however, be interesting to trace, by the  shells only, how beautifully this arrangement is developed.    The _Marginellae_ may be divided into two sections; the first bearing in  form and habit a strong resemblance to the _Cypraeae_, and the second  gradually losing these indications, and acquiring those of the spiral  _Volutae_. Among the first are several species, which, like the Cowries,  appear destitute of any spire (as in _M. cingulata_); this part, however,  begins to show itself in other successive species very progressively, until  it becomes elevated and defined in _M. glabella_. This shell may be  considered the passage to the second division, in which the species lose  the simple oval form of the first, and acquire a contracted base and  pointed spire, perfectly resembling _Voluta undulata Lam._ and its allies.  The extreme developement of these characters is shown in _M. faba_.    This genus must, then, be considered as connecting those of _Cypraea_ and  _Voluta_ (Lam.); excepting one, the whole of the species are very small;  and as the three here selected to illustrate these remarks are frequently  seen, and have been often described under other names, little more is  necessary than to detail their specific characters.           *       *       *       *       *    MARGINELLA cingulata,    _Banded Date Shell--upper figures._        _M. testa ovata, albida, lineis aurantiacis fasciata; spira obsoleta,      umbilicata; columella 6 plicata._        Shell oval, whitish, banded with orange lines; spire obsolete,      umbilicated; pillar 6 plaited.

Science should make no distinction of persons or countries; but it  is rather mortifying to observe, that these important discoveries in the  organization of animals, are pursued with zeal and ability by foreign  naturalists, while most of our own content themselves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39674"],[0,"Buffalo Land (#9)"],[1,"beldames might be taking a  nap under them, after a midnight ride. \"But, then,\" said Dobeen, \"the  dog's hairs don't stand on end as they always do in Ireland when they  see ghosts and witches.\" We believe that our worthy cook was really  disappointed in not discovering any stray broomsticks lying around.  These, he afterward informed us, could not be made invisible, though  their owners should take on airy shapes unrecognizable by mortal eyes.    Muggs had suggested urging the dogs in, but the party, wiser from  yesterday's experience, desired a ground shot, if it could be secured.  The Professor adjusted his lens, and decided to make a personal  inspection around the roots of the bush immediately in front of him.    Carefully the sage bent over the suspicious spot, and almost fell  backward as, with a whiz and a dart, half a dozen quails flew out,  brushing his very nose. Instantly every bush sent forth its fugitives. A  flash of feathered balls, and they were all gone. Such whizzing and  whirring! it was as if those scraggy bushes were _mitrailleuses_, in  quick succession discharging their loads.    Only one gun had gone off, but that so loudly that our ears rung for  several seconds. Mr. Colon had accidentally rammed at least two, perhaps  half a dozen, loads into one barrel, and the gun discharged with an aim  of its own, the butt very low down. Two birds fell dead. But alas for  our Nimrod! Colon stood with one hand on his stomach undecided whether  that organ remained or not. On this point, however, he was fully  re-assured at the supper-table that night, and in all our after  experience, we never knew that gun to have the least opportunity for  going off, except when at its owner's shoulder, and he perfectly ready  for it.    The two birds were now submitted to the party for inspection. They were  fine specimens of the American quail, more properly called by those  versed in quailology, the Bob White. This bird is very plentiful  throughout Kansas, and just before the shooting season commences, in  September, will even frequent the gardens and alight on the houses of  Topeka. They \"lay close\" before a dog, take flight into air with a  quick, whirring dart, and their shooting deservedly ranks high. They are  very rapid in their movements upon the ground, often running fifty or  seventy-five yards before hiding. When this takes place, so closely do  they huddle that it is seldom more than the upper bird that can be seen.  \"Green hunters\" sometimes pause, trying to discover the rest of the  covey before firing, and experience a great and sudden disgust when the  single bird which they have disdained suddenly develops into a dozen  flying ones.    We had an eventful days' sport, expending more ammunition than when  among the chickens, and with more satisfactory results, as we brought in  over two dozen birds. More than half of these were taken by Sachem at  one lucky discharge. He saw a covey in the grass, huddled together as  they generally are when not running. At these times they form a circle  about as large in diameter as the hoop of a nail keg, with tails to the  center and heads toward the outside. Fifteen quails would thus be a  circle of fifteen heads, and a pail, could it be dropped over the covey,  would cover them all. Not only is this an economy of warmth, there being  no outsiders half of whose bodies must get chilled, but there is no  blind side on which they can be approached, every portion of the circle  having its full quota of eyes. Let skunk or fox, or other roamer through  the grass, creep ever so stealthily, he will be seen and avoided by  flight. Sachem aiming at the midst of such a ring, broke it up as  effectually as Boutwell's discharge of bullion did that on Wall Street.    We have since found the frozen bodies of whole covies, which had gone to  roost in a circle and been buried under such a heavy fall of snow that  the birds could not force their way upward. Their habit is to remain in  imprisonment, apparently waiting for the snow to melt before even making  an effort for deliverance. Oftentimes it is then too late, a crust  having formed above. A severe winter will sometimes completely  exterminate the birds in certain localities.    During this first day of quail-shooting, we also saw for the first time  flocks of the snow-goose. The Professor counted fifty birds on one sand  bar. This variety, in its flight across the continent, apparently passes  through but a narrow belt of country, being found, to the best of my  knowledge, in but few of the states outside of Kansas.    Our return to the hotel was without accident, and our supper such as  hungry hunters might well enjoy. After it was disposed of, we gathered  around the ample stove in the hotel office, and lived over again the  events of the day.          CHAPTER VI.         OFF FOR BUFFALO LAND--THE NAVIGATION OF THE KAW--FORT RILEY--THE       CENTER-POST OF THE UNITED STATES--OUR PURCHASE OF HORSES--\"LO\" AS A       SAVAGE AND AS A CITIZEN--GRIPE UNFOLDS THE INDIAN QUESTION--A       BALLAD BY SACHEM, PRESENTING ANOTHER VIEW.      Next morning we said good-by to hospitable Topeka, and took up our  westward way over the Pacific Railroad. An ever-repeated succession of  valley and prairie stretched away on either hand. To the left the Kaw  came down with far swifter current than it has in its course below, from  its far-away source in Colorado. It might properly be called one of the  eaves or water-spouts of the great Rocky Mountain water-shed. With a  pitch of over five feet to the mile, its pace is here necessarily a  rapid one, and when at freshet height the stream is like a mill-race for  foam and fury.    At the junction of the Big Blue we found the old yet pretty town of  Manhattan. To this point, in early times, water transit was once  attempted. A boat of exceedingly light draught, one of those built to  run on a heavy dew, being procured, freight was advertised for, and the  navigation of the Kaw commenced. The one hundred miles or more to  Manhattan was accomplished principally by means of the capstan, the boat  being \"warped\" over the numberless shallows. This proved easier, of  course--a trifle easier--than if she had made the trip on macadamized  roads. If her stern had a comfortable depth of water it was seldom  indeed, except when her bow was in the air in the process of pulling the  boat over a sand bar. The scared catfish were obliged to retreat up  stream, or hug close under the banks, to avoid obstructing navigation,  and it is even hinted that more than one patriarch of the finny tribe  had to be pried out of the way to make room for his new rival to pass.    Once at Manhattan, the steamboat line was suspended for the season, its  captain and crew deciding they would rather walk back to the Missouri  River than drag the vessel there. Soon afterward, the steamer was burned  at her landing, and the Kaw has remained closed to commerce ever since.    About the same time, an enterprising Yankee advocated in the papers the  straightening of the river, and providing it with a series of locks,  making it a canal. As he had no money of his own with which to develop  his ideas into results, and could command nobody's else for that  purpose, the project failed in its very inception.    Fort Riley, four miles below Junction City, is claimed as the  geographical center of the United States, the exact spot being marked by  a post. What a rallying point that stick of wood will be for future  generations! When the corner-stone of the National Capitol shall there  be laid, the orator of the day can mount that post and exclaim, with  eloquent significance, elsewhere impossible, \"No north, no south, no  east, no west!\" and enthusiastic multitudes, there gathered from the  four quarters of the continent, will hail the words as the key-note of  the republic.    That spot of ground and that post are valuable. I hope a national  subscription will be started to buy it. It is the only place on our  continent which can ever be entirely free from local jealousies. There  would be no possible argument for ever removing the capital. The Kaw  could be converted into a magnificent canal, winding among picturesque  hills past the base of the Capitol; and then, in case of war, should any  hostile fleet ever ascend the rapid Missouri, it would be but necessary  for our legislators to grasp the canal locks, and let the water out, to  insure their perfect safety. Imagine the humiliation of a foreign naval  hero arriving with his iron-clads opposite a muddy ditch, and finding it  the only means of access to our capital!    A painful rumor has of late obtained circulation that a band of St.  Louis ku-klux, yclept capital movers, intend stealing the pole and  obliterating the hole. Let us hope, however, that it is without  foundation.    Before leaving Topeka, the party had purchased horses for the trip, and  consigned the precious load to a car, sending a note to General  Anderson, superintendent, asking that they might be promptly and  carefully forwarded to Hays City, our present objective point upon the  plains.    The professor, bringing previous experience into requisition, selected a  stout mustang--probably as tractable as those brutes ever become. He was  warranted by the seller never to tire, and he never did, keeping the  philosopher constantly on the alert to save neck and knees. It is the  simple truth that, in all our acquaintance with him, that mustang never  appeared in the least fatigued. After backing and shying all day, he  would spend the night in kicking and stealing from the other horses.    Mr. Colon, by rare good fortune, obtained a beautiful animal, formerly  known in Leavenworth as Iron Billy--a dark bay, with head and hair fine  as a pointer's, limbs cut sharp, and joints of elastic. After carrying  Mr. C. bravely for months, never tripping or failing, he was sold on our  return to the then Secretary of State, "]]]
