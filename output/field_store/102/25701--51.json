His style,  nevertheless, took root in Bologna within a very few years, no less from  the studies pursued by Tibaldi at Rome, as will be seen, than from the  examples left by Giorgio Vasari at San Michele in Bosco, in Bologna, in  Michelangiolo's style. Nor did these examples prove more useful to the  Bolognese than they had done to the Florentine artists; and here also they  opened the path to a less correct style. It is known that Vasari's works  were much commended there, and copied by young artists; that he had,  moreover, assistants among the Bolognese, such as Bagnacavallo, the  younger, and Fontana, who instructed not a few of his fellow citizens in  the art. To these causes we may attribute the circumstance, that those  Bolognese artists, nearest to the Caracci, were accustomed to colour, for  the most part, like the Florentines of the third epoch, that several were  extremely careless of the chiaroscuro, and frequently pursued the ideal and  the practical, more than nature and truth. Yet these complaints do not  apply either to so great a number of Bolognese, or to so long a period, as  to give a different aspect to the whole epoch. The one which we are now  about to describe, abounds with excellent artists; and to this shortly  succeeded the epoch of the Caracci, which improved the good, and brought  many extravagant artists into a correct method.    The earliest founders of the new school were Bartolommeo Ramenghi, called  Bagnacavallo, being sprung from thence, and Innocenzio Francucci da Imola.  Both educated by Francia, the former subsequently went to Rome, where we  have given an account of him among Raffaello's assistants; the latter to  Florence, where he attached himself to the school of Albertinelli, besides  studying very accurately, if I mistake not, the works of Frate and Andrea  del Sarto. Both, on returning to Bologna, met with rivals, though less with  the pencil than the tongue, in Aspertini and Cotignuola, artists whose  works present no instance of a style wholly modern. One master, Domenico, a  Bolognese, then flourished, equal to compete with the first names, but who  resided out of his native place. His name, lost during two or more  centuries, was brought to light, a few years ago, from the archives of S.  Sigismondo of Cremona, in whose church he executed, upon the ceiling, a  picture of Jonah ejected from the whale, which, in respect of the _di sotto  in su_, is most admirable. It was completed in 1537, when this art was yet  new in Italy; and I am at a loss to say whether Domenico acquired it from  Coreggio, or, as is more likely, from Melozzo, whose style he most  resembles of the two. I have seen no other work, nor met with any other  notice of this artist, unknown even to the Bolognese historians, perhaps on  account of his constant residence out of the place.    The first artist, therefore, who introduced a new style into Bologna, and  established it there, was Bagnacavallo, who had practised at Rome under  Raffaello, and not without advantage. He had not the depth of design  possessed by Giulio Romano, or Perino; but he nearly approached to the  latter, and was perhaps equal to him in taste of colouring, while, in the  gracefulness of his countenances, at least of the infantine and boyish, he  surpassed him. In his composition he most affected Raffaello, as may be  gathered from the celebrated Dispute of St. Augustine at the Scopetini,  where the maxims of the School of Athens, and of other copious and noble  conceptions of Sanzio, are apparent. Indeed in those subjects, treated by  the latter, Bagnacavallo contented himself with being a mere copyist,  declaring that it was madness to attempt to do better; in which it would  seem he followed Vida's opinion, and that of other poets of his age, who  inserted in their pages fragments of Virgil, because they despaired of  excelling him. Such a maxim, which, whatever truth it may contain, opens a  wide field for indolence and plagiarism, very probably injured him in the  eyes of Vasari, who confers on him the praise due to a good practitioner  rather than to a master grounded in the theory of his art. Still he  conducted some paintings, on the strength of his own invention, at S.  Michele in Bosco, at S. Martino, and at S. Maria Maggiore, which absolve  him from such an accusation; nor can I believe that the Caracci, Albano,  and Guido, would have copied from him and imitated his works, had they not  recognized in them the hand of a master.    There was a son of Bagnacavallo, named Gio. Batista, who was employed as an  assistant to Vasari in the palace of the chancery at Rome, and to  Primaticcio in the court of France. He likewise left various original works  in Bologna, more nearly inclining, if I judge rightly, to the decline of  the art in his own time, than to the examples of his father. In addition to  his son, mention ought here to be made of Bagnacavallo's companion, called  Biagio Pupini, and sometimes Maestro Biagio dalle Lamme, who, having been  at Rome with Ramenghi, contracted with him at Bologna a community of  labours and of interests, and assisted him in the Dispute just before  mentioned, as well as in other works. He formed the same connexion with  Girolamo da Trevigi and others, uniformly acquiring, if we are to credit  Vasari, more money than reputation, and at times injuring that of his  companion by his eagerness to finish. Whatever opinion we may entertain  regarding such facts, this artist by no means merits contempt; and perhaps  Vasari might have treated him with more lenity, had there not existed  between them mutual rivalship and disgust. In Pupini's style, where he  exerted his powers, we trace the manner of Francesco Francia, his master,  though a good deal enlarged, with the relief, and the various other  characteristics of the good age. Of this taste is a Nativity of our Lord  which he painted at Bologna, and which now adorns the institution of that  place.    Innocenzio, born at Imola, but residing always in Bologna, was admitted  into the school of Francia in 1506; from which we are not to infer, with  Malvasia, that he did not spend some years at Florence in company with  Albertinelli. This is attested by Vasari, and confirmed by the resemblance  of his style to that of the most distinguished Florentines of the age. He  produced several altar-pieces, composed in the taste of the fourteenth  century; but following the example of Frate and of Andrea, he placed the  Virgin above, without the ancient gildings, and with great art he grouped  and disposed the saints who attend her; while, with equal novelty, he  distributed the train of cherubs over the steps and through the surrounding  space. Sometimes, as in the extraordinary picture displayed in the  cathedral of Faenza, and another in possession of prince Ercolani, he added  some noble architecture, bold and drawn from the antique. In other  instances, as in the church of the Osservanti, at Pesaro, we observe the  most attractive landscape, combined with an aerial perspective, sufficient  to remind us of Vinci. He was accustomed too to insert little histories, as  in S. Giacomo at Bologna, where, at the foot of the picture, he painted a  Christ in the manger, of which it is enough to add, that it is perfectly  Raffaellesque. This, indeed, was the style to which he invariably aspired,  and so nearly attained, that very few of Raffaello's own pupils could equal  him. Those who may be desirous of convincing themselves, may examine the  altar-piece at Faenza in all its parts, and that of S. Michele in Bosco; to  say nothing of his Madonnas and his Holy Families, interspersed throughout  the Bolognese collections, and in the adjacent cities. He is preferred to  Francia and to Bagnacavallo, in all that relates to erudition, majesty, and  correctness. I am not aware that he executed compositions very new, or  subjects requiring fire and vigour, nor would they have been consistent  with his genius, which is described as of a gentle and tranquil cast.    The fame of the two masters, just celebrated, did not then extend far  beyond their native districts, being eclipsed by the celebrity of many  contemporaries, who swayed the regions of the art; in the list of whom was  Giulio Romano. His reputation drew to Mantua Francesco Primaticcio,  instructed in design by Innocenzio, and by Bagnacavallo in colouring. Under  Giulio he afterwards became a painter on a great scale, and a very copious  composer of large histories, as well as a decorator in wood and stucco in a  magnificent style suitable only for a palace. In this way, having studied  six years in Mantua, he was sent by Giulio to the court of the French king  Francis, and there, though Rosso the Florentine had arrived a year before,  and executed a variety of works, yet we learn that \"the first stuccos and  the first works in fresco of any consideration in France, took their rise  from Primaticcio,\" in the words of Vasari. Nor has he omitted to mention,  that the king bestowed upon this artist the abbey of St. Martin, though he  did not add that it brought him an annual income of eight thousand crowns,  while Rosso possessed only a canonship worth one thousand. In regard to  this last omission he is severely taxed with malice by Malvasia, with what  reason the reader will best judge for himself. We farther learn from Vasari  that this artist employed himself, as well as his young assistants, in  decorating a number of the halls and chambers at Fontainebleau, that he  supplied the court with many ancient marbles, and many moulds of excellent  sculpture, from which he had casts afterwards taken in bronze; in a word,  that he was like another Giulio, if not in architecture, at least in every  other kind of knowledge appertaining to the arts. The works conducted by  him in France have been described by Felibien, and from the same pen is  that appropriate eulogy-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#9)"],[1,"rsh, impertinent, and irksome.

[ENTER TRUEWIT WITH A POST-HORN, AND A HALTER IN HIS HAND.]       TRUE: By your leave, sir;--I am a stranger here:--Is your name     master Morose? is your name master Morose? Fishes! Pythagoreans     all! This is strange. What say you, sir? nothing? Has Harpocrates     been here with his club, among you? Well sir, I will believe you     to be the man at this time: I will venture upon you, sir. Your     friends at court commend them to you, sir--       MOR: O men! O manners! was there ever such an impudence?       TRUE: And are extremely solicitous for you, sir.       MOR: Whose knave are you?       TRUE: Mine own knave, and your compeer, sir.       MOR: Fetch me my sword--       TRUE: You shall taste the one half of my dagger, if you do, groom;     and you, the other, if you stir, sir: Be patient, I charge you,     in the king's name, and hear me without insurrection. They say, you     are to marry; to marry! do you mark, sir?       MOR: How then, rude companion!       TRUE: Marry, your friends do wonder, sir, the Thames being so near,     wherein you may drown, so handsomely; or London-bridge, at a low     fall, with a fine leap, to hurry you down the stream; or, such a     delicate steeple, in the town as Bow, to vault from; or, a braver     height, as Paul's; Or, if you affected to do it nearer home, and a     shorter way, an excellent garret-window into the street; or, a     beam in the said garret, with this halter     [HE SHEWS HIM A HALTER.]--     which they have sent, and desire, that you would sooner commit your     grave head to this knot, than to the wedlock noose; or, take a     little sublimate, and go out of the world like a rat; or a fly,     as one said, with a straw in your arse: any way, rather than to     follow this goblin Matrimony. Alas, sir, do you ever think to     find a chaste wife in these times? now? when there are so many     masques, plays, Puritan preachings, mad folks, and other strange     sights to be seen daily, private and public? If you had lived     in king Ethelred's time, sir, or Edward the Confessor, you might,     perhaps, have found one in some cold country hamlet, then, a dull     frosty wench, would have been contented with one man: now, they     will as soon be pleased with one leg, or one eye. I'll tell you,     sir, the monstrous hazards you shall run with a wife.       MOR: Good sir, have I ever cozen'd any friends of yours of their     land? bought their possessions? taken forfeit of their mortgage?     begg'd a reversion from them? bastarded their issue? What have I     done, that may deserve this?       TRUE: Nothing, sir, that I know, but your itch of marriage.       MOR: Why? if I had made an assassinate upon your father, vitiated     your mother, ravished your sisters--       TRUE: I would kill you, sir, I would kill you, if you had.       MOR: Why, you do more in this, sir: it were a vengeance centuple,     for all facinorous acts that could be named, to do that you do.       TRUE: Alas, sir, I am but a messenger: I but tell you, what you     must hear. It seems your friends are careful after your soul's     health, sir, and would have you know the danger: (but you may do     your pleasure for all them, I persuade not, sir.) If, after you are     married, your wife do run away with a vaulter, or the Frenchman     that walks upon ropes, or him that dances the jig, or a fencer     for his skill at his weapon; why it is not their fault, they have     discharged their consciences; when you know what may happen. Nay,     suffer valiantly, sir, for I must tell you all the perils that     you are obnoxious to. If she be fair, young and vegetous, no sweet-     meats ever drew more flies; all the yellow doublets and great     roses in the town will be there. If foul and crooked, she'll be     with them, and buy those doublets and roses, sir. If rich, and     that you marry her dowry, not her, she'll reign in your house     as imperious as a widow. If noble, all her kindred will be your     tyrants. If fruitful, as proud as May, and humorous as April; she     must have her doctors, her midwives, her nurses, her longings every     hour; though it be for the dearest morsel of man. If learned,     there was never such a parrot; all your patrimony will be too     little for the guests that must be invited to hear her speak     Latin and Greek; and you must lie with her in those languages     too, if you will please her. If precise, you must feast all the     silenced brethren, once in three days; salute the sisters;     entertain the whole family, or wood of them; and hear long-winded     exercises, singings and catechisings, which you are not given to,     and yet must give for: to please the zealous matron your wife, who     for the holy cause, will cozen you, over and above. You begin to     sweat, sir! but this is not half, i'faith: you may do your     pleasure, notwithstanding, as I said before: I come not to persuade     you.     [MUTE IS STEALING AWAY.]     --Upon my faith, master servingman, if you do stir, I will beat     you.       MOR: O, what is my sin! what is my sin!       TRUE: Then, if you love your wife, or rather dote on her, sir: O, how     she'll torture you! and take pleasure in your torments! you shall     lie with her but when she lists; she will not hurt her beauty, her     complexion; or it must be for that jewel, or that pearl, when she     does: every half hour's pleasure must be bought anew: and with the     same pain and charge you woo'd her at first. Then you must     keep what servants she please; what company she will; that friend     must not visit you without her license; and him she loves most, she     will seem to hate eagerliest, to decline your jealousy; or, feign     to be jealous of you first; and for that cause go live with her     she-friend, or cousin at the college, that can instruct her in all     the mysteries of writing letters, corrupting servants, taming     spies; where she must have that rich gown for such a great day; a     new one for the next; a richer for the third; be served in silver;     have the chamber fill'd with a succession of grooms, footmen,     ushers, and other messengers; besides embroiderers, jewellers,     tire-women, sempsters, feathermen, perfumers; whilst she feels not     how the land drops away; nor the acres melt; nor foresees the     change, when the mercer has your woods for her velvets; never     weighs what her pride costs, sir: so she may kiss a page, or a     smooth chin, that has the despair of a beard; be a stateswoman,     know all the news, what was done at Salisbury, what at the Bath,     what at court, what in progress; or, so she may censure poets, and     authors, and styles, and compare them, Daniel with Spenser, Jonson     with the t'other youth, and so forth: or be thought cunning in     controversies, or the very knots of divinity; and have often in     her mouth the state of the question: and then skip to the     mathematics, and demonstration: and answer in religion to one,     in state to another, in bawdry to a third.       MOR: O, O!       TRUE: All this is very true, sir. And then her going in disguise to     that conjurer, and this cunning woman: where the first question is,     how soon you shall die? next, if her present servant love her?    "]]]
