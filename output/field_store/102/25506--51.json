From that small container! Impossible!\"    \"Impossible,\" the Secretary agreed, \"but....\" He pointed with his one  good arm toward the Pacific. Two great ships of steel, blackened and  battered in that fiery breath, tossed helplessly upon the pitching,  heaving sea. They furnished to the scientist's exclamation the only  adequate reply.    Each man stared aghast into the pallid faces of his companions. \"I think  we have underestimated the opposition,\" said the Secretary of War  quietly. \"Look--the fog is coming in, but it's too late to save them.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The big ships were vanishing in the oncoming fog. Whirls of vapor were  eddying toward them in the flame-blaster air. Above them the watchers  saw dimly the five gleaming bulbs. There were airplanes attacking: the  tapping of machine-gun fire came to them faintly.    Fast planes circled and swooped toward the enemy. An armada of big  planes drove in from beyond. Formations were blocking space above....  Every branch of the service was there, Thurston exulted, the army,  Marine Corps, the Navy. He gripped hard at the dry ground in a paralysis  of taut nerves. The battle was on, and in the balance hung the fate of  the world.    The fog drove in fast. Through straining eyes he tried in vain to  glimpse the drama spread above. The world grew dark and gray. He buried  his face in his hands.    And again came the thunder. The men on the ground forced their gaze to  the clouds, though they knew some fresh horror awaited.    The fog-clouds reflected the blue terror above. They were riven and  torn. And through them black objects were falling. Some blazed as they  fell. They slipped into unthought maneuvers--they darted to earth  trailing yellow and black of gasoline fires. The air was filled with the  dread rain of death that was spewed from the gray clouds. Gone was the  roaring of motors. The air-force of the San Diego area swept in silence  to the earth, whose impact alone could give kindly concealment to their  flame-stricken burden.    Thurston's last control snapped. He flung himself flat to bury his face  in the sheltering earth.           *       *       *       *       *    Only the driving necessity of work to be done saved the sanity of the  survivors. The commercial broadcasting stations were demolished, a part  of the fuel for the terrible furnace across the bay. But the Naval radio  station was beyond on an outlying hill. The Secretary of War was in  charge. An hour's work and this was again in commission to flash to the  world the story of disaster. It told the world also of what lay ahead.  The writing was plain. No prophet was needed to forecast the doom and  destruction that awaited the earth.    Civilization was helpless. What of armies and cannon, of navies, of  aircraft, when from some unreachable height these monsters within their  bulbous machines could drop coldly--methodically--their diminutive  bombs. And when each bomb meant shattering destruction; each explosion  blasting all within a radius of miles; each followed by the blue blast  of fire that melted the twisted framework of buildings and powdered the  stones to make of a proud city a desolation of wreckage, black and  silent beneath the cold stars. There was no crumb of comfort for the  world in the terror the radio told.    Slim Riley was lying on an improvised cot when Thurston and the  representative of the Bureau of Standards joined him. Four walls of a  room still gave shelter in a half-wrecked building. There were candles  burning: the dark was unbearable.    \"Sit down,\" said MacGregor quietly; \"we must think....\"    \"Think!\" Thurston's voice had an hysterical note. \"I can't think! I  mustn't think! I'll go raving crazy....\"    \"Yes, think,\" said the scientist. \"Had it occurred to you that that is  our only weapon left?    \"We must think, we must analyze. Have these devils a vulnerable spot? Is  there any known means of attack? We do not know. We must learn. Here in  this room we have all the direct information the world possesses of this  menace. I have seen their machines in operation. You have seen more--you  have looked at the monsters themselves. At one of them, anyway.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The man's voice was quiet, methodical. Mr. MacGregor was attacking a  problem. Problems called for concentration; not hysterics. He could have  poured the contents from a beaker without spilling a drop. His poise was  needed: they were soon to make a laboratory experiment.    The door burst open to admit a wild-eyed figure that snatched up their  candles and dashed them to the floor.    \"Lights out!\" he screamed at them. \"There's one of 'em coming back.\" He  was gone from the room.    The men sprang for the door, then turned to where Riley was clumsily  crawling from his couch. An arm under each of his, and the three men  stumbled from the room.    They looked about them in the night. The fog-banks were high, drifting  in from the ocean. Beneath them the air was clear; from somewhere above  a hidden moon forced a pale light through the clouds. And over the  ocean, close to the water, drifted a familiar shape. Familiar in its  huge sleek roundness, in its funnel-shaped base where a soft roar made  vaporous clouds upon the water. Familiar, too, in the wild dread it  inspired.    The watchers were spellbound. To Thurston there came a fury of impotent  frenzy. It was so near! His hands trembled to tear at that door, to rip  at that foul mass he knew was within.... The great bulb drifted past. It  was nearing the shore. But its action! Its motion!    Gone was the swift certainty of control. The thing settled and sank, to  rise weakly with a fresh blast of gas from its exhaust. It settled  again, and passed waveringly on in the night.           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston was throbbingly alive with hope that was certainty. \"It's been  hit,\" he exulted; \"it's been hit. Quick! After it, follow it!\" He dashed  for a car. There were some that had been salvaged from the less ruined  buildings. He swung it quickly around where the others were waiting.    \"Get a gun,\" he commanded. \"Hey, you,\"--to an officer who  appeared--\"your pistol, man, quick! We're going after it!\" He caught the  tossed gun and hurried the others into the car.    \"Wait,\" MacGregor commanded. \"Would you hunt elephants with a pop-gun?  Or these things?\"    \"Yes,\" the other told him, \"or my bare hands! Are you coming, or aren't  you?\"    The physicist was unmoved. \"The creature you saw--you said that it  writhed in a bright light--you said it seemed almost in agony. There's  an idea there! Yes, I'm going with you, but keep your shirt on, and  think.\"    He turned again to the officer. \"We need lights,\" he explained, \"bright  lights. What is there? Magnesium? Lights of any kind?\"    \"Wait.\" The man rushed off into the dark.    He was back in a moment to thrust a pistol into the car. \"Flares,\" he  explained. \"Here's a flashlight, if you need it.\" The car tore at the  ground as Thurston opened it wide. He drove recklessly toward the  highway that followed the shore.    The high fog had thinned to a mist. A full moon was breaking through to  touch with silver the white breakers hissing on the sand. It spread its  full glory on dunes and sea: one more of the countless soft nights where  peace and calm beauty told of an ageless existence that made naught of  the red havoc of men or of monsters. It shone on the ceaseless surf  that had beaten these shores before there were men, that would thunder  there still when men were no more. But to the tense crouching men in the  car it shone only ahead on a distant, glittering speck. A wavering  reflection marked the uncertain flight of the stricken enemy.           *       *       *       *       *    Thurston drove like a maniac; the road carried them straight toward  their quarry. What could he do when he overtook it? He neither knew nor  cared. There was only the blind fury forcing him on within reach of the  thing. He cursed as the lights of the car showed a bend in the road. It  was leaving the shore.    He slackened their speed to drive cautiously into the sand. It dragged  at the car, but he fought through to the beach, where he hoped for firm  footing. The tide was out. They tore madly along the smooth sand,  breakers clutching at the flying wheels.    The strange aircraft was nearer; it was plainly over the shore, they  saw. Thurston groaned as it shot high in the air in an effort to clear  the cliffs ahead. But the heights were no longer a refuge. Again it  settled. It struck on the cliff to rebound in a last futile leap. The  great pear shape tilted, then shot end over end to crash hard on the  firm sand. The lights of the car struck the wreck, and they saw the  shell roll over once. A ragged break was opening--the spherical top fell  slowly to one side. It was still rocking as they brought the car to a  stop. Filling the lower shell, they saw dimly, was a mucouslike mass  that seethed and struggled in the brilliance of their lights.    MacGregor was persisting in his theory. \"Keep the lights on it!\" he  shouted. \"It can't stand the light.\"    While they watched, the hideous, bubbling beast oozed over the side of  the broken shell to shelter itself in the shadow beneath. And again  Thurston sensed the pulse and throb of life in the monstrous mass.           *       *       *       *       *    He saw again in his rage the streaming rain of black airplanes; saw,  too, the bodies, blackened and charred as they saw them when first they  tried rescue from the crashed ships; the smoke clouds and flames from  the blasted city, where people--his people, men and women and little  children--had met terrible death.

Suddenly a door crashed without, and the footsteps of men were heard  coming along the corridor. They stopped in front of Otto's cell; he  heard the jingle of keys, and then a loud rattle of one thrust into  the lock of the heavy oaken door. The rusty bolt was shot back with a  screech, the door opened, and there stood Baron Henry, no longer in his  armor, but clad in a long black robe that reached nearly to his feet,  a broad leather belt was girdled about his waist, and from it dangled a  short, heavy hunting sword.    Another man was with the Baron, a heavy-faced fellow clad in a leathern  jerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail.    The two stood for a moment looking into the room, and Otto, his pale  face glimmering in the gloom, sat upon the edge of the heavy wooden  bench or bed, looking back at them out of his great blue eyes. Then the  two entered and closed the door behind them.    \"Dost thou know why thou art here?\" said the Baron, in his deep, harsh  voice.    \"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I know not.\"    \"So?\" said the Baron. \"Then I will tell thee. Three years ago the good  Baron Frederick, my uncle, kneeled in the dust and besought mercy at thy  father's hands; the mercy he received was the coward blow that slew him.  Thou knowest the story?\"    \"Aye,\" said Otto, tremblingly, \"I know it.\"    \"Then dost thou not know why I am here?\" said the Baron.    \"Nay, dear Lord Baron, I know not,\" said poor little Otto, and began to  weep.    The Baron stood for a moment or two looking gloomily upon him, as the  little boy sat there with the tears running down his white face.    \"I will tell thee,\" said he, at last; \"I swore an oath that the red cock  should crow on Drachenhausen, and I have given it to the dames. I swore  an oath that no Vuelph that ever left my hands should be able to strike  such a blow as thy father gave to Baron Frederick, and now I will fulfil  that too. Catch the boy, Casper, and hold him.\"    As the man in the mail shirt stepped toward little Otto, the boy leaped  up from where he sat and caught the Baron about the knees. \"Oh! dear  Lord Baron,\" he cried, \"do not harm me; I am only a little child, I have  never done harm to thee; do not harm me.\"    \"Take him away,\" said the Baron, harshly.    The fellow stooped, and loosening Otto's hold, in spite of his struggles  and cries, carried him to the bench, against which he held him, whilst  the Baron stood above him.    Baron Henry and the other came forth from the cell, carefully closing  the wooden door behind them. At the end of the corridor the Baron  turned, \"Let the leech be sent to the boy,\" said he. And then he turned  and walked away.    Otto lay upon the hard couch in his cell, covered with a shaggy bear  skin. His face was paler and thinner than ever, and dark rings encircled  his blue eyes. He was looking toward the door, for there was a noise of  someone fumbling with the lock without.    Since that dreadful day when Baron Henry had come to his cell, only two  souls had visited Otto. One was the fellow who had come with the Baron  that time; his name, Otto found, was Casper. He brought the boy his rude  meals of bread and meat and water. The other visitor was the leech or  doctor, a thin, weasand little man, with a kindly, wrinkled face and a  gossiping tongue, who, besides binding wounds, bleeding, and leeching,  and administering his simple remedies to those who were taken sick in  the castle, acted as the Baron's barber.    The Baron had left the key in the lock of the door, so that these two  might enter when they chose, but Otto knew that it was neither the one  nor the other whom he now heard at the door, working uncertainly with  the key, striving to turn it in the rusty, cumbersome lock. At last the  bolts grated back, there was a pause, and then the door opened a little  way, and Otto thought that he could see someone peeping in from without.  By and by the door opened further, there was another pause, and then  a slender, elfish-looking little girl, with straight black hair and  shining black eyes, crept noiselessly into the room.    She stood close by the door with her finger in her mouth, staring at  the boy where he lay upon his couch, and Otto upon his part lay, full of  wonder, gazing back upon the little elfin creature.    She, seeing that he made no sign or motion, stepped a little nearer, and  then, after a moment's pause, a little nearer still, until, at last, she  stood within a few feet of where he lay.    \"Art thou the Baron Otto?\" said she.    \"Yes,\" answered Otto.    \"Prut!\" said she, \"and is that so! Why, I thought that thou wert a great  tall fellow at least, and here thou art a little boy no older than Carl  Max, the gooseherd.\" Then, after a little pause--\"My name is Pauline,  and my father is the Baron. I heard him tell my mother all about thee,  and so I wanted to come here and see thee myself: Art thou sick?\"    \"Yes,\" said Otto, \"I am sick.\"    \"And did my father hurt thee?\"    \"Aye,\" said Otto, and his eyes filled with tears, until one sparkling  drop trickled slowly down his white face.    Little Pauline stood looking seriously at him for a while. \"I am sorry  for thee, Otto,\" said she, at last. And then, at her childish pity, he  began crying in earnest.    This was only the first visit of many from the little maid, for after  that she often came to Otto's prison, who began to look for her coming  from day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom.    Sitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open  eyes, she would listen to him by the hour, as he told her of his life in  that far away monastery home; of poor, simple brother John's wonderful  visions, of the good Abbot's books with their beautiful pictures, and of  all the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and  emperors of ancient Rome, which brother Emmanuel had taught him to read  in the crabbed monkish Latin in which they were written.    One day the little maid sat for a long while silent after he had ended  speaking. At last she drew a deep breath. \"And are all these things that  thou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true?\" said  she.    \"Yes,\" said Otto, \"all are true.\"    \"And do they never go out to fight other priests?\"    \"No,\" said Otto, \"they know nothing of fighting.\"    \"So!\" said she. And then fell silent in the thought of the wonder of  it all, and that there should be men in the world that knew nothing of  violence and bloodshed; for in all the eight years of her life she had  scarcely been outside of the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.    At another time it was of Otto's mother that they were speaking.    \"And didst thou never see her, Otto?\" said the little girl.    \"Aye,\" said Otto, \"I see her sometimes in my dreams, and her face always  shines so bright that I know she is an angel; for brother John has often  seen the dear angels, and he tells me that their faces always shine in  that way. I saw her the night thy father hurt me so, for I could not  sleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder. Then she  came and leaned over me and kissed my forehead, and after that I fell  asleep.\"    \"But where did she come from, Otto?\" said the little girl.    \"From paradise, I think,\" said Otto, with that patient seriousness that  he had caught from the monks, and that sat so quaintly upon him.    \"So!\" said little Pauline; and then, after a pause, \"That is why thy  mother kissed thee when thy head ached--because she is an angel. When  I was sick my mother bade Gretchen carry me to a far part of the house,  because I cried and so troubled her. Did thy mother ever strike thee,  Otto?\"    \"Nay,\" said Otto.    \"Mine hath often struck me,\" said Pauline.    One day little Pauline came bustling into Otto's cell, her head full of  the news which she carried. \"My father says that thy father is out  in the woods somewhere yonder, back of the castle, for Fritz, the  swineherd, told my father that last night he had seen a fire in the  woods, and that he had crept up to it without anyone knowing. There he  had seen the Baron Conrad and six of his men, and that they were eating  one of the swine that they had killed and roasted. Maybe,\" said she,  seating herself upon the edge of Otto's couch; \"maybe my father will  kill thy father, and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a  black bed with bright candles burning around him, as they did my uncle  Frederick when he was killed.\"    \"God forbid!\" said Otto, and then lay for a while with his hands  clasped. \"Dost thou love me, Pauline?\" said he, after a while.    \"Yes,\" said Pauline, \"for thou art a good child, though my father says  that thy wits are cracked.\"    \"Mayhap they are,\" said Otto, simply, \"for I have often been told so  before. But thou wouldst not see me die, Pauline; wouldst thou?\"    \"Nay,\" said Pauline, \"I would not see thee die, for then thou couldst  tell me no more stories; for they told me that uncle Frederick could not  speak because he was dead.\"    \"Then listen, Pauline,\" said Otto; \"if I go not away from here I shall  surely die. Every day I grow more sick and the leech cannot cure me.\"  Here he broke down and, turning his face upon the couch, began crying,  while little Pauline sat looking seriously at him.    \"Why dost thou cry, Otto?\" said she, after a while.    \"Because,\" said he, \"I am so sick, and I want my father to come and take  me away from here.\"    \"But why dost thou want to go away?\" said Pauline. \"If thy father takes  thee away, thou canst not tell me any more stories.\"    \"Yes, I can,\" said Otto, \"for when I grow to be a man I will come  again and marry thee, and when thou art my wife I can tell thee all the  stories that I know. Dear Pauline, canst thou not tell my father where I  am, that he may come here and"]]]
