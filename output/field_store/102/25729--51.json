Public opinion was against that 'ere particular bell, and we  jes' got laughed at, ringin' it. So we stopped, and here we be,  without it.\"    Mr. Olsen's blue eyes sparkled again as he caught his little wife's  glance, half amused, half pained. He changed the subject, and went  among his parishioners, inquiring kindly for the absent ones, and  making new friends.    At a quarter before three (the hour for afternoon service) he entered  the meeting-house again. The sexton was asleep in one of the pews. He  was roused by a summons so startling that a repetition was necessary  before he could comprehend its import.    \"R-ring the bell!\" he gasped incredulously. \"W-why, sir, it hasn't  been rung for\"--    \"Never mind, Mr. Bedlow,\" interrupted Harold, with his pleasant smile.  \"Let's try it to-day, just for a change.\"    Harold had attended one or two prayer-meetings, as well as Sunday  services, and--had an idea.    On reaching the entry, the sexton shivered in the cold air, and  pointed helplessly to a hole in the ceiling, through which the bell  rope was intended to play.    \"I put it up inside out of the way, so's the boys couldn't get it,\" he  chattered. \"D-don't you think, sir, we'd better wait till\"--    But it was no use to talk to empty air. The new minister had gone, and  presently returned with a long heavy bench, which he handled as easily  as if it were a lady's work-basket.    \"Just steady it a bit,\" he asked; and Mr. Bedlow, with conscientious  misgivings as to the propriety of his assisting at a gymnastic  performance on Sunday, did as he was bid.    Up went the minister like a cat; and presently down came the knotted  end of the rope. \"Now, let's have a good, hearty pull, Mr. Bedlow.\"    The sexton grasped the rope and pulled. There was one frightened,  discordant outcry from the astonished bell; and there stood poor Mr.  Bedlow with about three yards of detached rope in his hands. It had  broken just above the point where it passed through the flooring over  his head.    \"Now, sir,\" expostulated the sexton.    \"Here, Dick!\" called Mr. Olsen, to a bright-faced little fellow who  had put his head in at the door and was regarding these unwonted  proceedings with round-eyed astonishment; \"won't you run over to my  house and ask my wife for that long piece of clothes-line that hangs  up in the kitchen closet?\"    Dick was gone like a flash, his curiosity excited to the highest  pitch.    \"What does he want it for?\" asked pretty Olga Olsen, hurrying to  produce the required article.    \"Don't know,\" panted Dick. \"He's got Mr. Bedlow--in the entry--an' he  sent for a rope, double quick!\"    With which bewildering statement he tore out of the house and back to  the church.    Five minutes later the population of North Penfield were astounded by  hearing a long-silent, but only too familiar voice.    \"It's that old cracked bell!\" exclaimed half a hundred voices at once,  in as many families. \"Do let's go to meetin' an' see what's the  matter.\"    The afternoon's congregation was, in fact, even larger than the  morning's. Harold noted it with quiet satisfaction, and gave out as  his text the first verse of the sixty-sixth Psalm.    At the close of his brief sermon he paused a moment, then referred to  the subject in all their thoughts, speaking in no flippant or jesting  tone, but in a manner that showed how sacredly important he considered  the matter.    \"I have been pained to notice,\" he said gravely, \"the tardiness with  which we begin our meetings. It is perfectly natural that we should be  late, when there is no general call, such as we have been accustomed  to hear from childhood. I do not blame anybody in the least. I do  believe that we have all grown into a certain sluggishness, both  physical and spiritual, in our assembling together, as a direct  consequence of the omission of those tones which to us and our fathers  have always spoken but one blessed word--'_Come!_' I believe,\" he  continued, looking about over the kindly faces before him, \"I believe  you agree with me that something should be done. Don't think me too  hasty or presuming in my new pastorate, if I add that it seems to me  vitally important to take action at once. Our bell is not musical, it  is true, but its tones, cracked and unmelodious as they are, will  serve to remind us of our church home, its duties and its pleasures.  On Tuesday evening we will hold a special meeting in this house to  consider the question of purchasing a new bell, to take the place of  the old. The Prudential Committee, and all who are interested in the  subject are urged to be present. Let us pray.\"    It was a wonderful \"season,\" that Tuesday evening conference. The  cracked bell did its quavering best for a full twenty minutes before  the hour appointed, to call the people together; and no appeal could  have been more irresistible.    Two-thirds of the sum required was raised that night. For ten days  more the old bell rang on every possible occasion, until it became an  accusing voice of conscience to the parish. Prayer-meetings once more  began sharp on the hour, and proceeded with old-time vigor. The  interest spread until a real revival was in progress before the North  Penfield Society were fairly aware of the change. Still the \"bell  fund\" lacked fifty dollars of completion.    On the evening of the twentieth of December, in the midst of a furious  storm, a knock was heard at the parsonage, and lo, at the hastily  opened door stood Squire Radbourne, powdered with snowflakes, and  beaming like a veritable Santa Claus.    \"I couldn't feel easy,\" he announced, after he had been relieved of  coat and furs, and seated before the blazing fire, \"to have next  Sunday go by without a new bell on the meeting-house. We must have  some good hearty ringing on that morning, sure; it's the twenty-fifth,  you know. So here's a little Christmas present to the parish--or the  Lord, either way you want to put it.\"    The crisp fifty-dollar note he laid down before the delighted couple  was all that was needed.    Harold made a quick calculation--he had already selected a bell at a  foundry a hundred miles away--and sitting down at his desk wrote  rapidly.    \"I'll mail your letter,\" said the squire. \"It's right on my way--or  near enough. Let's get it off to-night, to save time.\"    And away he trudged again, through the deepening drifts and the blur  of the white storm.    On Saturday evening, after all the village people were supposed to be  abed and asleep, two dark figures might have been seen moving to and  fro in the old meeting-house, with a lantern. After some irregular  movements in the entry, the light appeared in the belfry, and a little  later, one queer, flat, brassy note, uncommonly like the voice of the  cracked bell, rang out on the night air. Then there was absolute  silence; and before long the meeting-house was locked up and left to  itself again on Christmas Eve--alone, with the wonder-secret of a new  song in its faithful heart, waiting to break forth in praise of God at  dawn of day.    How the people started that fair Christmas morning, as the sweet,  silvery notes fell on their ears! They hastened to the church; they  pointed to the belfry where the bell swung to and fro in a joyous call  of \"_Come! Come! Come! Come!_\"    They listened in rapt silence, and some could not restrain their sobs,  while others with grateful tears in their eyes looked upon the old,  rusty, cracked bell that rested, silent, on the church floor; and as  they looked, and even passed their hands lovingly over its worn sides,  they thanked God for its faithful service and the good work it had  wrought--and for the glad hopes that filled that blessed Christmas  Day.          VI    CHRISTMAS FOLK-LORE        \"At Christmas play, and make good cheer,        For Christmas comes but once a year.\"      So said good Thomas Tusser, many generations ago, and his words have  echoed in the hearts of old and young, rich and poor, from his day up  to this blessed Year of Our Lord, 1898. Let us thank God and take  courage when we remember that the Power of Evil has no one Book to set  off against the Bible, and no one day to match Christmas. It is one of  the gladdest and fairest signs of the times that this merry holiday,  so full of good-will to men, is drawing closer and closer to the heart  of the nation. For this one season in the year, everybody is thinking  of everybody else, instead of himself, and we join the wise men in  their march across the desert, following the Star, until we, too, find  ourselves upon our knees before the manger in which the young Child  was.    It is among the nations of the North, the Germans, the Swedes, the  Norwegians and the English, that the finest and deepest significance  has been attached to this holy day. Among the German peasantry,  especially, are found numerous home legends, beliefs and superstitions  which even the nineteenth century, with its growth of science and  liberal thought, has been unable to reach. Many of these customs and  beliefs have never been told in any language save that of the country  in which they took their rise; the folk-lore of the Teutonic nations  is still a rich storehouse of treasures for the antiquarian, and for  those who love Christmas for its own truest meaning, the day when  Christ was born.    The concurrence of the winter solstice with Christmas gave rise in the  earliest times to many of the tales of Norse mythology. In the summer  the good gods, Woden and Freia, with thousands of friendly elves,  brought flowers and fruits to cheer the heart of man. But as winter  came on, and the days grew ever shorter and the dark nights longer,  the evil spirits held the good gods, enchanted by their power, far up  among the snowy mountains, and prevented the passage of pious souls to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#9)"],[1,"time, by indulging the  privilege of dropping afterwards every indifferent acquaintance, without  breach of civility or good manners.    Even in societies, which are established on principles the most immoral,  and the most destructive to the interests of the general society, there  are required certain rules, which a species of false honour, as well as  private interest, engages the members to observe. Robbers and pirates,  it has often been remarked, could not maintain their pernicious  confederacy, did they not establish a pew distributive justice among  themselves, and recall those laws of equity, which they have violated  with the rest of mankind.    I hate a drinking companion, says the Greek proverb, who never forgets.  The follies of the last debauch should be buried in eternal oblivion, in  order to give full scope to the follies of the next.    Among nations, where an immoral gallantry, if covered with a thin veil  of mystery, is, in some degree, authorized by custom, there immediately  arise a set of rules, calculated for the conveniency of that attachment.  The famous court or parliament of love in Provence formerly decided all  difficult cases of this nature.    In societies for play, there are laws required for the conduct of the  game; and these laws are different in each game. The foundation, I own,  of such societies is frivolous; and the laws are, in a great measure,  though not altogether, capricious and arbitrary. So far is there a  material difference between them and the rules of justice, fidelity, and  loyalty. The general societies of men are absolutely requisite for the  subsistence of the species; and the public conveniency, which regulates  morals, is inviolably established in the nature of man, and of the  world, in which he lives. The comparison, therefore, in these respects,  is very imperfect. We may only learn from it the necessity of rules,  wherever men have any intercourse with each other.    They cannot even pass each other on the road without rules. Waggoners,  coachmen, and postilions have principles, by which they give the way;  and these are chiefly founded on mutual ease and convenience. Sometimes  also they are arbitrary, at least dependent on a kind of capricious  analogy like many of the reasonings of lawyers.           [Footnote: That the lighter machine yield to the heavier, and, in  machines of the same kind, that the empty yield to the loaded; this rule  is founded on convenience. That those who are going to the capital take  place of those who are coming from it; this seems to be founded on some  idea of dignity of the great city, and of the preference of the future  to the past. From like reasons, among foot-walkers, the right-hand  entitles a man to the wall, and prevents jostling, which peaceable  people find very disagreeable and inconvenient.]    To carry the matter farther, we may observe, that it is impossible for  men so much as to murder each other without statutes, and maxims, and an  idea of justice and honour. War has its laws as well as peace; and  even that sportive kind of war, carried on among wrestlers, boxers,  cudgel-players, gladiators, is regulated by fixed principles. Common  interest and utility beget infallibly a standard of right and wrong  among the parties concerned.        SECTION V. WHY UTILITY PLEASES.        PART I.        It seems so natural a thought to ascribe to their utility the praise,  which we bestow on the social virtues, that one would expect to meet  with this principle everywhere in moral writers, as the chief foundation  of their reasoning and enquiry. In common life, we may observe, that the  circumstance of utility is always appealed to; nor is it supposed, that  a greater eulogy can be given to any man, than to display his usefulness  to the public, and enumerate the services, which he has performed to  mankind and society. What praise, even of an inanimate form, if the  regularity and elegance of its parts destroy not its fitness for any  useful purpose! And how satisfactory an apology for any disproportion  or seeming deformity, if we can show the necessity of that particular  construction for the use intended! A ship appears more beautiful to an  artist, or one moderately skilled in navigation, where its prow is wide  and swelling beyond its poop, than if it were framed with a precise  geometrical regularity, in contradiction to all the laws of mechanics. A  building, whose doors and windows were exact squares, would hurt the  eye by that very proportion; as ill adapted to the figure of a human  creature, for whose service the fabric was intended.    What wonder then, that a man, whose habits and conduct are hurtful to  society, and dangerous or pernicious to every one who has an intercourse  with him, should, on that account, be an object of disapprobation, and  communicate to every spectator the strongest sentiment of disgust and  hatred.           [Footnote: We ought not to imagine, because an inanimate object  may be useful as well as a man, that therefore it ought also, according  to this system, to merit he appellation of VIRTUOUS. The sentiments,  excited by utility, are, in the two cases, very different; and the one  is mixed with affection, esteem, approbation, &c., and not the other. In  like manner, an inanimate object may have good colour and proportions  as well as a human figure. But can we ever be in love with the former?  There are a numerous set of passions and sentiments, of which thinking  rational beings are, by the original constitution of nature, the only  proper objects: and though the very same qualities be transferred to an  insensible, inanimate being, they will not excite the same sentiments.  The beneficial qualities of herbs and minerals are, indeed, sometimes  called their VIRTUES; but this is an effect of the caprice of language,  which out not to be regarded in reasoning. For though there be a species  of approbation attending even inanimate objects, when beneficial, yet  this sentiment is so weak, and so different from that which is directed  to beneficent magistrates or statesman; that they ought not to be ranked  under the same class or appellation.       A very small variation of the object, even where the same qualities are  preserved, will destroy a sentiment. Thus, the same beauty, transferred  to a different sex, excites no amorous passion, where nature is not  extremely perverted.]      But perhaps the difficulty of accounting for these effects of  usefulness, or its contrary, has kept philosophers from admitting them  into their systems of ethics, and has induced them rather to employ any  other principle, in explaining the origin of moral good and evil. But it  is no just reason for rejecting any principle, confirmed by experience,  that we cannot give a satisfactory account of its origin, nor are able  to resolve it into other more general principles. And if we would  employ a little thought on the present subject, we need be at no loss to  account for the influence of utility, and to deduce it from principles,  the most known and avowed in human nature.    From the apparent usefulness of the social virtues, it has readily  been inferred by sceptics, both ancient and modern, that all moral  distinctions arise from education, and were, at first, invented, and  afterwards encouraged, by the art of politicians, in order to render  men tractable, and subdue their natural ferocity and selfishness, which  incapacitated them for society. This principle, indeed, of precept and  education, must so far be owned to have a powerful influence, that it  may frequently increase or diminish, beyond their natural standard,  the sentiments of approbation or dislike; and may even, in particular  instances, create, without any natural principle, a new sentiment of  this kind; as is evident in all superstitious practices and observances:  But that ALL moral affection or dislike arises from this origin, will  never surely be allowed by any judicious enquirer. Had nature made no  such distinction, founded on the original constitution of the mind, the  words, HONOURABLE and SHAMEFUL, LOVELY and ODIOUS, NOBLE and DESPICABLE,  had never had place in any language; nor could politicians, had they  invented these terms, ever have been able to render them intelligible,  or make them convey any idea to the audience. So that nothing can be  more superficial than this paradox of the sceptics; and it were well,  if, in the abstruser studies of logic and metaphysics, we could as  easily obviate the cavils of that sect, as in the practical and more  intelligible sciences of politics and morals.    The social virtues must, therefore, be allowed to have a natural  beauty and amiableness, which, at first, antecedent to all precept or  education, recommends them to the esteem of uninstructed mankind, and  engages their affections. And as the public utility of these virtues is  the chief circumstance, whence they derive their merit, it follows,  that the end, which they have a tendency to promote, must be some  way agreeable to us, and take hold of some natural affection. It must  please, either from considerations of self-interest, or from more  generous motives and regards.    It has often been asserted, that, as every man has a strong connexion  with society, and perceives the impossibility of his solitary  subsistence, he becomes, on that account, favourable to all those habits  or principles, which promote order in society, and insure to him the  quiet possession of so inestimable a blessing, As much as we value  our own happiness and welfare, as much must we applaud the practice  of justice and humanity, by which alone the social confederacy can  be maintained, and every man reap the fruits of mutual protection and  assistance.    This deduction of morals from self-love, or a regard to private  interest, is an obvious thought, and has not arisen wholly from the  wanton sallies and sportive assaults "]]]
