In the first fortnight of their engagement the waggons travelled  backward and forward between Pieter-Maritzburg and Grey Town, which for  the time formed the base for the column of Colonel Glyn.  The distance  of the town from the capital was forty-five miles, and as the waggons  travelled at the rate of fifteen miles a day, they were twelve days in  accomplishing two double journeys.  When they were loaded up the third  time, they received orders to go straight through to the headquarters of  the column at Helpmakaar.  The boys were pleased at the change, for the  road as far as Grey Town was a good one.    They reached Grey Town for the third time on the 2nd of January.  Here  they found the place in a state of great excitement, a mounted messenger  having arrived that morning with the news that Cetewayo had refused all  demands and that large bodies of the Zulus were marching towards the  frontier to oppose the various columns collecting there.    On arriving at the government-yard the lads received orders at once to  unload the waggons and to take on the stores of the 2nd battalion of the  24th, which was to march from Grey Town the next morning.  The start was  delayed until the afternoon, as sufficient waggons had not arrived to  take on their baggage.  The road was rough, and it was late in the  afternoon before they arrived at the Mooin River.    The weather had set in wet, the river was in flood, and the oxen had  immense difficulty in getting the waggons across.  Two teams had to be  attached to each waggon, and even then it was as much as they could do  to get across, for the water was so high that it nearly took them off  their feet.    The troops were taken over in punts, and, after crossing, a halt was  made for the night.    After seeing the cattle outspanned and attended to, the boys wandered  away among the troops, as they were to start at daybreak, and it was  long past dark before all were over.  The tents were not pitched, and  the troops bivouacked in the open.  Brushwood was collected from the  rough ground around, and blazing fires were soon burning merrily.  It  was all new and very amusing to the boys.  The troops were in high  spirits at the prospect of an early brush with the enemy, and songs were  sung around the fires until the bugle rang out the order, \"Lights out,\"  when the men wrapped themselves in their blankets and lay down, and the  boys retired to their snug shelter under the waggons, where their  Kaffirs had as usual laid piles of brushwood to serve as their beds.    The next morning they were off early, and reached the Tugela after five  hours' march.  This river does not here form the frontier between  Zululand and Natal, this being marked by the Buffalo--a much larger and  more important stream--from the point where this falls into the Tugela,  some fifteen miles below the spot where they crossed the latter river,  which here runs towards the southwest.  Two more days' marching took the  column to Helpmakaar.  The weather was wet and misty, and the troops now  marched in close order, with flankers thrown out, for the road ran  parallel with the Buffalo, about five miles distant, and it was thought  possible that the Zulus might cross the river and commence hostilities.  A cordon of sentinels had, however, been placed all along the river from  Rorke's Drift down to the point of junction of the Buffalo and Tugela;  below the stream was so wide that there was no fear of the Zulus  effecting a crossing.    Most of the troops which had been stationed at Helpmakaar had already  marched up to Rorke's Drift, and after staying two days at Helpmakaar  the 2nd battalion of the 24th marched to that place, where the 1st  battalion of the same regiment were already encamped.    Two days later the remainder of the force destined to act under Colonel  Glyn had assembled at Rorke's Drift--the term \"drift\" meaning a ford  across a river.    This column was the strongest of those which had been formed for the  simultaneous invasion of Zululand, and General Thesiger was himself upon  the spot to accompany it.  Many of the waggons which had brought up  stores were sent back to Grey Town for further supplies; but those of  the boys, being laden with the spare ammunition and baggage of a portion  of the 24th, were to accompany the column in its advance.    The last two days of the term granted to Cetewayo to accede to our terms  were full of excitement; it had been reported, indeed, that the king was  determined upon resistance, but it was thought probable that he might  yield at the last moment, and the road leading down to the drift on the  other side of the river was anxiously watched.    As the hours went on and no messenger was seen approaching, the spirits  of the troops rose, for there is nothing that soldiers hate so much as,  after enduring the fatigues preparatory to the opening of a campaign,  the long marches, the wet nights, and other privations and hardships,  for the enemy to yield without a blow.  Men who had been in the  campaigns of Abyssinia and Ashanti told their comrades how on both  occasions the same uncertainty had prevailed as to the intentions of the  enemy up to the last moment; and the fact that in both campaigns the  enemy had at the last moment resolved to fight, was hailed as a sort of  presage that a similar determination would be arrived at by the Zulu  king.    To the boys these days passed very pleasantly; they had nothing to do  but to wander about the camp and watch the proceedings.  There was a  parade of the two native regiments before the general, who was much  pleased with their appearance, and who exhorted them on no account to  kill women, children, or prisoners.    Among these native regiments were curiously many Zulus; for great  numbers of this people had at various times been obliged to take refuge  in Natal, to avoid the destruction threatened them by their despotic  king, and these were now eager to fight against their late monarch.    Some of the bodies of volunteer horse were very smart and soldier-like  in their appearance.  They were for the most part composed of young  farmers, and Dick and Tom bitterly regretted that they had not been a  few years older, in which case, instead of looking after a lot of bulls,  as Dick contemptuously said, they might have been riding in the ranks of  the volunteers.    By the regulars the two days were spent in cleaning their arms and  accoutrements, whose burnish and cleanliness had suffered much in the  long wet march, and from the bivouacs on the damp ground.    After marching from Grey Town with the 24th the boys had been placed  regularly on the roll of the army, as conductors, and, although they  drew no pay, had now the advantage of receiving rations as white men.  They had upon the line of march frequently chatted with the young  officers of the regiment, who, finding that they were the sons of  well-to-do farmers and were cheery, high-spirited lads, took to them  very much, and invited them of an evening to join them round the  camp-fire.    The last day came, and still no messenger arrived from Cetewayo, and in  the evening orders were issued that the column should at daybreak pass  the drift and advance into the enemy's country.  The troops laid down  that night in high spirits, little dreaming of the disaster which was to  befall them in the campaign which they thought of so lightly.    CHAPTER FIVE.    ISANDULA.    At two o'clock on the morning of the 11th of January the bugle sounded  the reveille and the troops prepared to cross the Buffalo.  Tents were  struck, baggage piled on the waggons, and the regiments stood to arms at  half-past four.  The native contingent crossed first.  The cavalry  brigade under Lieutenant-Colonel Russell placed their ammunition on a  pontoon and rode over.  The river was in some places up to the necks of  the infantry, and even the cavalry were nearly swept away.  The first  and second battalions of the 24th crossed on the pontoons.  The third  regiment of the native contingent threw out skirmishers, but could find  no trace of the enemy.    A heavy storm had come on at daybreak, but this left off at nine  o'clock.  Lieutenant-Colonel Buller, commanding the Frontier Light  Horse, now rode in from the camp of Colonel Wood's force, which had  crossed the Blood River and had encamped in Zululand at a spot about  thirty-two miles distant.  Lord Chelmsford rode over there with an  escort of the Natal Mounted Police and the Natal Carabineers, who on  their return captured three hundred head of cattle, several horses, and  a number of sheep and goats.  During the day the waggons, oxen, and  ambulances were brought across the river on the platoon.    Early next morning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32947"],[0,"On Snake-Poison: Its Action and Its Antidote (#9)"],[1,"treatment there is of a very high order, and his grateful countrymen  will ever cherish his memory. When his Excellency the Viceroy had been  appealed to in vain by the writer, and the adoption of his method in  India urged through two Australian Governors, a native of India has  stepped forward and taken the first step towards alleviating an evil  that has hurried over two millions of his countrymen in every century to  an untimely grave.    The cases as reported by him to the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ are  cited below.    [Illustration]          CASES.      If the deductions and conclusions set forth in the foregoing chapters  are correct, it may be justly contended that all cases of snakebite  treated with strychnine should invariably end in recovery if the  antidote is properly applied, according to the rules above detailed.  This contention the writer fully and cordially endorses. Given the  largest amount of poison a snake can give off at one bite, strychnine  injected in time and sufficient quantity--either by the hypodermic, or,  if urgent, by the intravenous method--must rouse the dormant nerve-cells  into action, as long as the vital functions are not completely extinct.  Wherever it fails, the fault lies with the operator not injecting it in  sufficient quantity--a fault committed by the writer himself in his  first case.    The following condensed accounts of fifty cases treated in Australia,  and eight in India, the writer has taken mostly from the _Australasian  Medical Gazette_. Two of these only are from his own practice; others  were kindly communicated to him by his colleagues. It is not claimed  that all these cases were rescues from certain death. Some of them  undoubtedly were, others would have recovered under some other treatment  or no treatment at all; but in none of them would recovery have been so  rapid and complete. The two poisons are thrown out together, and no  ill-effects of either are experienced beyond a certain degree of  weakness, which passes off quickly. This is a boon to be appreciated  fully by those only who have gone through the slow, lingering, and  painful process of convalescence from snakebite as formerly treated,  with its deadly languor and weariness, making life itself a burden and  all physical and mental exertion impossible.        CASE 1.--A. H., 15 years old, a farm labourer, was bitten on the      right index finger whilst feeling for a rabbit in a burrow. Did      not see the snake nor suspect snakebite, but collapsed helplessly      in a few minutes after returning to his work. The writer saw him      three hours after the accident. He was then completely paralysed      and in deep coma; pupils widely dilated and not reacting to light;      sense of sight and hearing dead; heart action extremely feeble;      pulse small, thread-like, and scarcely countable; respiration      quick and shallow; skin blanched and very cold. Seeing him dragged      along the road between two men, had him quickly carried to the      next house, and injected 20 minims of liq. strychnine. Only a      groan or two and a slight improvement in the pulse, indicating a      change in his condition, gave him a second injection about twenty      minutes after the first one. A change for the better then became      rapidly conspicuous. The pulse gained in strength from minute to      minute, respiration became deeper, and the coma was visibly      reduced to mere sleep, from which there was no difficulty in      rousing him to full consciousness by a vigorous shake of the      shoulders. This marvellous change was brought about within forty      minutes; and this being the first case to which the writer had      applied his theory by injecting strychnine, its unparalleled      success exceeded his most sanguine expectations, but unfortunately      also lulled him into a false sense of security, which proved      disastrous to his patient. Not knowing then as he does now that      the snake-poison after having been subdued by the antidote is not      thrown out of the system as quickly as the strychnine, and is      therefore apt to re-assert itself, he allowed another urgent      engagement to take him away from the lad after watching him for      two hours and actually taking the evening tea with him. His      instructions to the mother not to let her son go to sleep and to      watch him carefully for the slightest sign of the return of      symptoms, were unfortunately disobeyed. Both mother and son went      to sleep, deeming all danger over. During this sleep the lad again      relapsed into coma and was found so at daylight. All attempts to      rouse him were fruitless, and he died before the messenger      intended for me had time to saddle a horse. The death of the      unfortunate lad, however, has saved some lives since. It taught      the writer the lesson never to trust to the apparent success of      the antidote until it shows distinct signs of its own      physiological action, and even then to watch his patients      carefully for the first twenty-four hours, and let them sleep for      short periods only.        CASE 2.--A.H., a vigorous girl of 20 years, bitten above the left      ankle by a snake in some long grass, and therefore not identified.      Had applied two tight ligatures above the bite, ran home and got      her mother to cut out the bitten skin, showing two distinct      punctures. Seen within an hour after the bite the girl presented      distinct, but moderate symptoms, deadly paleness, very cold skin,      small frequent pulse, and a peculiar feeling of agony about the      heart, just able to sit upright, but unable to walk. All symptoms      increased rapidly after writer cut ligatures. She reeled from side      to side, and suddenly fell forward as if in a swoon. Injected      1/6th grain of strychnine and, as she did not lose consciousness,      was able to watch the interesting and rapid effect of the      antidote. It had not been injected more than five minutes when      slight colour returned to the cheeks, naturally very red. Patient      then stated that the distressing feeling about the heart was      getting less and also that of drowsiness. From minute to minute      her condition improved, and in about ten she was able to rise and      walk a few steps. Profiting, however, by the lesson his first case      had given him, the writer did not trust to her apparent recovery,      but seeing that much of the poison had been eliminated by the      prompt measures taken before he saw her, he injected only 1/12th      of a grain, which produced slight muscular spasms. Careful      precautions were taken in this case against a relapse, but none      took place, and when visited next morning the girl declared      herself as well as ever she had been in her life.        The following notes of two cases of tiger snake bite      (_Hoplocephalus curtus_), treated with strychnine, were read by      Dr. Thwaites before the Intercolonial Medical Congress of 1889.      This gentleman, a young practitioner just entering practice, had      the courage to use the antidote according to the writer's      directions in spite of the hostile criticisms of his seniors in      the profession and even his own university teachers, and thereby      not only saved two valuable lives, but also set a praiseworthy      example, which was soon followed by others. The writer gives the      notes abbreviated.        CASE 3.--J. B., a strong, robust labourer, bitten by a tiger snake      on the back of right hand. Killed the snake, which hung on to the      hand and was with some difficulty shaken off. Made slight incision      through the punctures and tied a rag round the wrist, but too      loosely to check circulation; then started for the next      neighbour's house, distant a mile, which he reached with      difficulty, staggering like a drunken man when he arrived. The      bitten skin was here excised, whisky administered and patient sent      on in a buggy, but distance being 30 miles to Dr. Thwaites'      residence, a messenger on horseback galloped ahead to get Dr.      Thwaites to meet buggy on road. The latter writes: \"I met buggy      four miles from my residence. Patient had to be held up on the      seat of the vehicle between two men. He had not spoken for some      time, pulse very weak, pupils greatly dilated, face very pale. I      injected 10 minims of liq. strychnine P.B. at once, and in a few      minutes noticed some improvement. He now answered when spoken to,      his pulse became stronger, and he could walk a few steps. This was      at 5.30 p.m., and he kept up fairly well till 8.15, when he      collapsed completely. I now injected 20 minims of liq. strychniae,      which in a short time brought him round; but at 9.15 another      relapse took place, when a third injection of 15 m. was made.      This was followed by slight twitching about the face and neck,      after which improvement and recovery were uninterrupted.\"        Dr. Thwaites' second case is even more remarkable and telling.      When the girl, after a journey of 30 miles, was carried into his      surgery, she appeared to be dead, and a second medical man, who      happened to be present, declared her to be so, and all attempts to      revive her useless.        CASE 4.--A. D., aged 15 years, a schoolgirl, bitten by a vigorous      tiger-snake on the outside of left leg, the snake also holding on      for some time. She at once tightened her garter above the knee and      ran home, a distance of three-quarters of a mile. The bitten skin      was at once excised, another firm ligature applied, whisky      administered, and a hurried start made for Dr. Thwaites', distant      30 miles, where she arrived five hours after accident. The latter      writes:--\"She was then pulseless at wrists, cold as a stone, and      with pupils insensible to light. I could not perceive"]]]
