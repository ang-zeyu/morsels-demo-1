[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4339"],[0,"Nerves and Common Sense (#9)"],[1," a moment--and we feel natural  when we are in it--but it is poison all the same.    If a woman has a habit of constantly snuffing or clearing her  throat, or rocking a rocking chair, or chattering to whoever may be  near her she would feel unnatural and weird if she were suddenly  wrenched out of any of these things. And yet the poisoning process  goes on just the same.    When it seems immaterial to us that we should be natural we are in a  pretty bad way and the worst of it is we do not know it.    I once took a friend with me into the country who was one of those  women who lived on excitement in every-day life. When she dressed in  the morning she dressed in excitement. She went down to breakfast in  excitement. She went about the most humdrum everyday affairs  excited. Every event in life--little or big--was an excitement to  her--and she went to bed tired out with excitement--over nothing.    We went deep in the woods and in the mountains, full of great  powerful quiet.    When my friend first got there she was excited about her arrival,  she was excited about the house and the people in it, but in the  middle of the night she jumped up in bed with a groan of torture.    I thought she had been suddenly taken ill and started up quickly  from my end of the room to see what was the trouble.    \"Oh, oh,\" she groaned, \"the quiet! It is so quiet!\" Her brain which  had been in a whirl of petty excitement felt keen pain when the  normal quiet touched it.    Fortunately this woman had common sense and I could gradually  explain the truth to her, and she acted upon it and got rested and  strong and quiet.    I knew another woman who had been wearing shoes that were too tight  for her and that pinched her toes all together. The first time she  wore shoes that gave her feet room enough the muscles of her feet  hurt her so that she could hardly walk.    Of course, having been cramped into abnormal contraction the process  of expanding to freedom would be painful.    If you had held your fist clenched tight for years, or months, or  even weeks, how it would hurt to open it so that you could have free  use of your fingers.    The same truth holds good with a fist that has been clenched, a foot  that has been pinched, or a brain that has been contracted with  excitement.    The process leading from the abnormal to the normal is always a  painful one. To stay in the abnormal means blindness, constantly  limiting power and death.    To come out into a normal atmosphere and into a normal way of living  means clearer sight, constantly increasing power, and fresh life.    This habit of excitement is not only contracting to the brain; it  has its effect over the whole body. If there is any organ that is  weaker than any other the excitement eventually shows itself. A  woman may be suffering from indigestion, or she may be running up  large doctor's bills because of either one of a dozen other organic  disturbances, with no suspicion that the cause of the whole trouble  is that the noisy, excited, strained habits of her life have robbed  her body of the vitality it needed to keep it in good running order.    As if an engineer threw his coal all over the road and having no  fuel for his engine wondered that it would not run. Stupid women we  are--most of us!    The trouble is that many of us are so deeply immersed in the habit  of excitement that we do not know it.    It is a healthy thing to test ourselves and to really try to find  ourselves out. It is not only healthy; it is deeply interesting.    If quiet of the woods, or, any other quiet place, makes us fidgety,  we may be sure that our own state is abnormal and we had better go  into the woods as often as possible until we feel ourselves to be a  part of the quiet there.    If we go into the woods and get soothed and quieted and then come  out and get fussed up and excited so that we feel painfully the  contrast between the quiet and our every-day life, then we can know  that we are living in the habit of abnormal excitement and we can  set to work to stop it.    \"That is all very well,\" I hear my readers say, \"but how are you  going to stop living in abnormal excitement when every circumstance  and every person about you is full of it and knows nothing else?\"    If you really want to do it and would feel interested to make  persistent effort I can give you the recipe and I can promise any  woman that if she perseveres until she has found the way she will  never cease to be grateful.    If you start with the intention of taking the five minutes' search  for quiet every day, do not let your intention be weakened or  yourself discouraged if for some days you see no result at all.    At first it may be that whatever quiet you find will seem so strange  that it will annoy you or make you very nervous, but if you persist  and work right through, the reward will be worth the pains many  times over.    Sometimes quieting our minds helps us to quiet our bodies; sometimes  we must quiet our bodies first before we can find the way to a  really quiet mind. The attention of the mind to quiet the body, of  course, reacts back on to the mind, and from there we can pass on to  thinking quietly. Each individual must judge for herself as to the  best way of reaching the quiet. I will give several recipes and you  can take your choice.    First, to quiet the body:--    1. Lie still and see how quietly you can breathe.    2. Sit still and let your head droop very slowly forward until  finally it hangs down with its whole weight. Then lift it up very,  very slowly and feel as if you pushed it all the way up from the  lower part of your spine, or, better still, as if it grew up, so  that you feel the slow, creeping, soothing motion all the way up  your spine while your head is coming up, and do not let your head  come to an entirely erect position until your chest is as high as  you can hold it comfortably. When your head is erect take a long,  quiet breath and drop it again. You can probably drop it and raise  it twice in the five minutes. Later on it should take the whole five  minutes to drop it and raise it once and an extra two minutes for  the long breath.    When you have dropped your head as far as you can, pause for a full  minute without moving at all and feel heavy; then begin at the lower  part of your spine and very slowly start to raise it. Be careful not  to hold your breath, and watch to breathe as easily and quietly as  you can while your head is moving.    If this exercise hurts the back of your neck or any part of your  spine, don't be troubled by it, but go right ahead and you will soon  come to where it not only does not hurt, but is very restful.    When you have reached an erect position again stay there  quietly--first take long gentle breaths and let them get shorter and  shorter until they are a good natural length, then forget your  breathing altogether and sit still as if you never had moved, you  never were going to move, and you never wanted to move.    This emphasizes the good natural quiet in your brain and so makes  you more sensitive to unquiet.    Gradually you will get the habit of catching yourself in states of  unnecessary excitement; at such times you cannot go off by yourself  and go through the exercises. You cannot even stop where you are and  go through them, but you can recall the impression made on your  brain at the time you did them and in that way rule out your  excitement and gain the real power that should be in its place.    So little by little the state of excitement becomes as unpleasant as  a cloud of dust on a windy day and the quiet is as pleasant as under  the trees on top of a hill in the best kind of a June day.    The trouble is so many of us live in a cloud of dust that we do not  suspect even the existence of the June day, but if we are fortunate  enough once or twice even to get to sneezing from the dust, and so  to recognize its unpleasantness, then we want to look carefully to  see if there is not a way out of it.    It is then that we can get the beginning of the real quiet which is  the normal atmosphere of every human being.    But we must persist for a long time before we can feel established  in the quiet itself. What is worth having is worth working for--and  the more it is worth having, the harder work is required to get it.    Nerves form habits, and our nerves not only get the habit of living  in the dust, but the nerves of all about us have the same habit. So  that when at first we begin to get into clear air, we may almost  dislike it, and rush back into the dust again, because we and our  friends are accustomed to it.    All that bad habit has to be fought, and conquered, and there are  many difficulties in the way of persistence, but the reward is worth  it all, as I hope to show in later articles.    I remember once walking in a crowded street where the people were  hurrying and rushing, where every one's face was drawn and knotted,  and nobody seemed to be having a good time. Suddenly and  unexpectedly I saw a man coming toward me with a face so quiet that  it showed out like a little bit of calm in a tornado. He looked like  a common, every-day man of the world, so far as his dress and  general bearing went, and his features were not at all unusual, but  his expression was so full of quiet interest as to be the greatest  contrast to those about him. He was not thinking his own thoughts  either--he was one of the crowd and a busy, interested observer.    He might have said, \"You silly geese, what are you making all this  fuss about, you can do it much better if you will go more easily.\"  If that was his thought it came from a very kindly sense of humor,  and he gave me a new realization of what it meant, practically, to  be in the world and not of it.    If you are in the world you can live, and observe, and take a much  better part in its workings. If you are of it, you are simply  whirled in an eddy of dust,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#9)"],[1,"along the coast for many miles and see all the ledges, all  the cliffs and corners of the mountain-sides, up to a height of from two  to five hundred feet, literally covered with sea-birds, whose white  breasts show against the dark rocks as if the rocks were closely  sprinkled with chalk specks. The air, near and far, is, so to say, full  with fowls.\"(3)    Each of such \"bird-mountains\" is a living illustration of mutual aid, as  well as of the infinite variety of characters, individual and specific,  resulting from social life. The oyster-catcher is renowned for its  readiness to attack the birds of prey. The barge is known for its  watchfulness, and it easily becomes the leader of more placid birds. The  turnstone, when surrounded by comrades belonging to more energetic  species, is a rather timorous bird; but it undertakes to keep watch for  the security of the commonwealth when surrounded by smaller birds. Here  you have the dominative swans; there, the extremely sociable  kittiwake-gulls, among whom quarrels are rare and short; the  prepossessing polar guillemots, which continually caress each other; the  egoist she-goose, who has repudiated the orphans of a killed comrade;  and, by her side, another female who adopts any one's orphans, and now  paddles surrounded by fifty or sixty youngsters, whom she conducts and  cares for as if they all were her own breed. Side by side with the  penguins, which steal one another's eggs, you have the dotterels, whose  family relations are so \"charming and touching\" that even passionate  hunters recoil from shooting a female surrounded by her young ones; or  the eider-ducks, among which (like the velvet-ducks, or the coroyas of  the Savannahs) several females hatch together in the same nest, or the  lums, which sit in turn upon a common covey. Nature is variety itself,  offering all possible varieties of characters, from the basest to the  highest: and that is why she cannot be depicted by any sweeping  assertion. Still less can she be judged from the moralist's point of  view, because the views of the moralist are themselves a result--mostly  unconscious--of the observation of Nature.    Coming together at nesting-time is so common with most birds that more  examples are scarcely needed. Our trees are crowned with groups of  crows' nests; our hedges are full of nests of smaller birds; our  farmhouses give shelter to colonies of swallows; our old towers are the  refuge of hundreds of nocturnal birds; and pages might be filled with  the most charming descriptions of the peace and harmony which prevail in  almost all these nesting associations. As to the protection derived by  the weakest birds from their unions, it is evident. That excellent  observer, Dr. Coues, saw, for instance, the little cliff-swallows  nesting in the immediate neighbourhood of the prairie falcon (Falco  polyargus). The falcon had its nest on the top of one of the minarets of  clay which are so common in the canons of Colorado, while a colony of  swallows nested just beneath. The little peaceful birds had no fear of  their rapacious neighbour; they never let it approach to their colony.  They immediately surrounded it and chased it, so that it had to make off  at once.(4)    Life in societies does not cease when the nesting period is over; it  begins then in a new form. The young broods gather in societies of  youngsters, generally including several species. Social life is  practised at that time chiefly for its own sake--partly for security,  but chiefly for the pleasures derived from it. So we see in our forests  the societies formed by the young nuthatchers (Sitta caesia), together  with tit-mouses, chaffinches, wrens, tree-creepers, or some  wood-peckers.(5) In Spain the swallow is met with in company with  kestrels, fly-catchers, and even pigeons. In the Far West of America the  young horned larks live in large societies, together with another lark  (Sprague's), the skylark, the Savannah sparrow, and several species of  buntings and longspurs.(6) In fact, it would be much easier to describe  the species which live isolated than to simply name those species which  join the autumnal societies of young birds--not for hunting or nesting  purposes, but simply to enjoy life in society and to spend their time in  plays and sports, after having given a few hours every day to find their  daily food.    And, finally, we have that immense display of mutual aid among  birds-their migrations--which I dare not even enter upon in this place.  Sufficient to say that birds which have lived for months in small bands  scattered over a wide territory gather in thousands; they come together  at a given place, for several days in succession, before they start, and  they evidently discuss the particulars of the journey. Some species will  indulge every afternoon in flights preparatory to the long passage. All  wait for their tardy congeners, and finally they start in a certain well  chosen direction--a fruit of accumulated collective experience--the  strongest flying at the head of the band, and relieving one another in  that difficult task. They cross the seas in large bands consisting of  both big and small birds, and when they return next spring they repair  to the same spot, and, in most cases, each of them takes possession of  the very same nest which it had built or repaired the previous year.(7)    This subject is so vast, and yet so imperfectly studied; it offers so  many striking illustrations of mutual-aid habits, subsidiary to the main  fact of migration--each of which would, however, require a special  study--that I must refrain from entering here into more details. I can  only cursorily refer to the numerous and animated gatherings of birds  which take place, always on the same spot, before they begin their long  journeys north or south, as also those which one sees in the north,  after the birds have arrived at their breeding-places on the Yenisei or  in the northern counties of England. For many days in  succession--sometimes one month--they will come together every morning  for one hour, before flying in search of food--perhaps discussing the  spot where they are going to build their nests.(8) And if, during the  migration, their columns are overtaken by a storm, birds of the most  different species will be brought together by common misfortune. The  birds which are not exactly migratory, but slowly move northwards and  southwards with the seasons, also perform these peregrinations in  flocks. So far from migrating isolately, in order to secure for each  separate individual the advantages of better food or shelter which are  to be found in another district--they always wait for each other, and  gather in flocks, before they move north or south, in accordance with  the season.(9)    Going now over to mammals, the first thing which strikes us is the  overwhelming numerical predominance of social species over those few  carnivores which do not associate. The plateaus, the Alpine tracts, and  the Steppes of the Old and New World are stocked with herds of deer,  antelopes, gazelles, fallow deer, buffaloes, wild goats and sheep, all  of which are sociable animals. When the Europeans came to settle in  America, they found it so densely peopled with buffaloes, that pioneers  had to stop their advance when a column of migrating buffaloes came to  cross the route they followed; the march past of the dense column  lasting sometimes for two and three days. And when the Russians took  possession of Siberia they found it so densely peopled with deer,  antelopes, squirrels, and other sociable animals, that the very conquest  of Siberia was nothing but a hunting expedition which lasted for two  hundred years; while the grass plains of Eastern Africa are still  covered with herds composed of zebra, the hartebeest, and other  antelopes.    Not long ago the small streams of Northern America and Northern Siberia  were peopled with colonies of beavers, and up to the seventeenth century  like colonies swarmed in Northern Russia. The flat lands of the four  great continents are still covered with countless colonies of mice,  ground-squirrels, marmots, and other rodents. In the lower latitudes of  Asia and Africa the forests are still the abode of numerous families of  elephants, rhinoceroses, and numberless societies of monkeys. In the far  north the reindeer aggregate in numberless herds; while still further  north we find the herds of the musk-oxen and numberless bands of polar  foxes. The coasts of the ocean are enlivened by flocks of seals and  morses; its waters, by shoals of sociable cetaceans; and even in the  depths of the great plateau of Central Asia we find herds of wild  horses, wild donkeys, wild camels, and wild sheep. All these mammals  live in societies and nations sometimes numbering hundreds of thousands  of individuals, although now, after three centuries of gunpowder  civilization, we find but the debris of the immense aggregations of old.  How trifling, in comparison with them, are the numbers of the  carnivores! And how false, therefore, is the view of those who speak of  the animal world as if nothing were to be seen in it but lions and  hyenas plunging their bleeding teeth into the flesh of their victims!  One might as well imagine that the whole of human life is nothing but a  succession of war massacres.    Association and mutual aid are the rule with mammals. We find social  habits even among the carnivores, and we can only name the cat tribe  (lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) as a division the members of which  decidedly prefer isolation to society, and are but seldom met with even  in small groups. And yet, even among lions \"this is a very common  practice to hunt in company.\"(10) The two tribes of the civets  (Viverridae) and the weasels (Mustelidae) might also be characterized by  their isolated life, but it is a fact that during the last century the  common weasel was more sociable than"]]]
