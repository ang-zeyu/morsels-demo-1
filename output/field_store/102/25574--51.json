I heard the voices of the Hans approaching. It was time to  act. The next few seconds would tell whether the ships in the air would  try or be able to melt us into nothingness. I spoke.    \"Are you boys all ready?\" I asked, creeping to a position opposite the  door and drawing my hand-gun.    Again there was a chorus of assent.    \"Then on the count of three, shoot up those repellor rays--all of  them--and for God's sake, don't miss.\" And I counted.    I think my \"three\" was a bit weak. I know it took all the courage I had  to utter it.    For an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the landing party  from the ship strolled into my range of vision.    Then startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant they stood  frozen with horror at whatever they saw.    One hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple of them  made a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I fired pointblank  with my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as I could and aiming at  their feet to make sure my explosive rockets would make contact and do  their work.    The detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on which the Hans  stood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there was nothing there except  their torn and mutilated corpses. They had been fairly bunched, and I  got them all.    I ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into infinity by  the sweep of a disintegrator ray.    Some eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to earth. A  disintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a  moment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I  stood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it  shot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth.  I looked out, then stepped out on the ground.    The only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which  were hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must  have crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of  my own rockets.    Somebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships  and it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away,  drifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over  the ground below it.    I shouted with exultation and relief.    \"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.    His commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship,  rang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the  compartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet  had absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might  have been fractured.    \"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms  and strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did  we?\"    \"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that  one is drifting down toward the south; we've captured this one we're in  intact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"    [Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of  him, catching the Han full in the stomach.]    Less than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in  ultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of  the Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It  was in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:    \"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to  navigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron  of seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent  destruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a  series of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the  GK-984.    \"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the  seven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment,  about seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time,  seven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent  disturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity  registers applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.    \"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which  overtook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena  similar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead  while beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works  and camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the  deduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet  undetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to  the Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the  Navigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this  technique and develop a defense against it.    \"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory  in particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the  official inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire  force of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to  a width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present  considering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the  Navigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence  of the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the  public interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a  scientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring  destruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence  actually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the  Military will hold to a defensive policy.    \"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the  Heaven-Council has the matter under consideration.    \"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the  following condensation of its detailed observations:    \"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where  the wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location  finder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope  relays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope  views of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the  presence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed  any indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On  orders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25  scouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood  above at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection  of the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one  man on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at  universal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from  the bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with  which he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.    \"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at  Base was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the  GK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck,  recorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from  the wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close  range these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at  which the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once  ordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave  the control room in compliance with this order. An instant later  confused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be  made by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control  room, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base  Captain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his  belief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the  control room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the  room, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain  flashed throughout the ship.    \"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control,  dimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed  it more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding  explosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays  registered terrific concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and  projectoscopes apparatus went dead.    \"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives, backed by  the photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of  the landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship.  Then in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred  inside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray  generators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.    \"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an  identical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the  knowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was  different.    \"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an  explosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern  down for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates  and indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic,  except for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley,  and the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen.

In the midst a paved be-fountained square, populated only by  a few men dressed in blue, and a good many singularly ugly bronze images  (one on the top of a tall column).  The said square guarded up to the  edge of the roadway by a four-fold line of big men clad in blue, and  across the southern roadway the helmets of a band of horse-soldiers, dead  white in the greyness of the chilly November afternoon--I opened my eyes  to the sunlight again and looked round me, and cried out among the  whispering trees and odorous blossoms, \"Trafalgar Square!\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick, who had drawn rein again, \"so it is.  I don't wonder at  your finding the name ridiculous: but after all, it was nobody's business  to alter it, since the name of a dead folly doesn't bite.  Yet sometimes  I think we might have given it a name which would have commemorated the  great battle which was fought on the spot itself in 1952,--that was  important enough, if the historians don't lie.\"    \"Which they generally do, or at least did,\" said the old man.  \"For  instance, what can you make of this, neighbours?  I have read a muddled  account in a book--O a stupid book--called James' Social Democratic  History, of a fight which took place here in or about the year 1887 (I am  bad at dates).  Some people, says this story, were going to hold a ward-  mote here, or some such thing, and the Government of London, or the  Council, or the Commission, or what not other barbarous half-hatched body  of fools, fell upon these citizens (as they were then called) with the  armed hand.  That seems too ridiculous to be true; but according to this  version of the story, nothing much came of it, which certainly _is_ too  ridiculous to be true.\"    \"Well,\" quoth I, \"but after all your Mr. James is right so far, and it  _is_ true; except that there was no fighting, merely unarmed and  peaceable people attacked by ruffians armed with bludgeons.\"    \"And they put up with that?\" said Dick, with the first unpleasant  expression I had seen on his good-tempered face.    Said I, reddening: \"We _had_ to put up with it; we couldn't help it.\"    The old man looked at me keenly, and said: \"You seem to know a great deal  about it, neighbour!  And is it really true that nothing came of it?\"    \"This came of it,\" said I, \"that a good many people were sent to prison  because of it.\"    \"What, of the bludgeoners?\" said the old man.  \"Poor devils!\"    \"No, no,\" said I, \"of the bludgeoned.\"    Said the old man rather severely: \"Friend, I expect that you have been  reading some rotten collection of lies, and have been taken in by it too  easily.\"    \"I assure you,\" said I, \"what I have been saying is true.\"    \"Well, well, I am sure you think so, neighbour,\" said the old man, \"but I  don't see why you should be so cocksure.\"    As I couldn't explain why, I held my tongue.  Meanwhile Dick, who had  been sitting with knit brows, cogitating, spoke at last, and said gently  and rather sadly:    \"How strange to think that there have been men like ourselves, and living  in this beautiful and happy country, who I suppose had feelings and  affections like ourselves, who could yet do such dreadful things.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, in a didactic tone; \"yet after all, even those days were a  great improvement on the days that had gone before them.  Have you not  read of the Mediaeval period, and the ferocity of its criminal laws; and  how in those days men fairly seemed to have enjoyed tormenting their  fellow men?--nay, for the matter of that, they made their God a tormentor  and a jailer rather than anything else.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"there are good books on that period also, some of  which I have read.  But as to the great improvement of the nineteenth  century, I don't see it.  After all, the Mediaeval folk acted after their  conscience, as your remark about their God (which is true) shows, and  they were ready to bear what they inflicted on others; whereas the  nineteenth century ones were hypocrites, and pretended to be humane, and  yet went on tormenting those whom they dared to treat so by shutting them  up in prison, for no reason at all, except that they were what they  themselves, the prison-masters, had forced them to be.  O, it's horrible  to think of!\"    \"But perhaps,\" said I, \"they did not know what the prisons were like.\"    Dick seemed roused, and even angry.  \"More shame for them,\" said he,  \"when you and I know it all these years afterwards.  Look you, neighbour,  they couldn't fail to know what a disgrace a prison is to the  Commonwealth at the best, and that their prisons were a good step on  towards being at the worst.\"    Quoth I: \"But have you no prisons at all now?\"    As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I felt that I had made a  mistake, for Dick flushed red and frowned, and the old man looked  surprised and pained; and presently Dick said angrily, yet as if  restraining himself somewhat--    \"Man alive! how can you ask such a question?  Have I not told you that we  know what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy  books, helped out by our own imaginations?  And haven't you specially  called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look  happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours  were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly?  And if  there were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you may  an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a  lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison  business is.  Prisons, indeed!  O no, no, no!\"    He stopped, and began to cool down, and said in a kind voice: \"But  forgive me!  I needn't be so hot about it, since there are _not_ any  prisons: I'm afraid you will think the worse of me for losing my temper.  Of course, you, coming from the outlands, cannot be expected to know  about these things.  And now I'm afraid I have made you feel  uncomfortable.\"    In a way he had; but he was so generous in his heat, that I liked him the  better for it, and I said:    \"No, really 'tis all my fault for being so stupid.  Let me change the  subject, and ask you what the stately building is on our left just  showing at the end of that grove of plane-trees?\"    \"Ah,\" he said, \"that is an old building built before the middle of the  twentieth century, and as you see, in a queer fantastic style not over  beautiful; but there are some fine things inside it, too, mostly  pictures, some very old.  It is called the National Gallery; I have  sometimes puzzled as to what the name means: anyhow, nowadays wherever  there is a place where pictures are kept as curiosities permanently it is  called a National Gallery, perhaps after this one.  Of course there are a  good many of them up and down the country.\"    I didn't try to enlighten him, feeling the task too heavy; but I pulled  out my magnificent pipe and fell a-smoking, and the old horse jogged on  again.  As we went, I said:    \"This pipe is a very elaborate toy, and you seem so reasonable in this  country, and your architecture is so good, that I rather wonder at your  turning out such trivialities.\"    It struck me as I spoke that this was rather ungrateful of me, after  having received such a fine present; but Dick didn't seem to notice my  bad manners, but said:    \"Well, I don't know; it is a pretty thing, and since nobody need make  such things unless they like, I don't see why they shouldn't make them,  if they like.  Of course, if carvers were scarce they would all be busy  on the architecture, as you call it, and then these 'toys' (a good word)  would not be made; but since there are plenty of people who can carve--in  fact, almost everybody, and as work is somewhat scarce, or we are afraid  it may be, folk do not discourage this kind of petty work.\"    He mused a little, and seemed somewhat perturbed; but presently his face  cleared, and he said: \"After all, you must admit that the pipe is a very  pretty thing, with the little people under the trees all cut so clean and  sweet;--too elaborate for a pipe, perhaps, but--well, it is very pretty.\"    \"Too valuable for its use, perhaps,\" said I.    \"What's that?\" said he; \"I don't understand.\"    I was just going in a helpless way to try to make him understand, when we  came by the gates of a big rambling building, in which work of some sort  seemed going on.  \"What building is that?\" said I, eagerly; for it was a  pleasure amidst all these strange things to see something a little like  what I was used to: \"it seems to be a factory.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I think I know what you mean, and that's what it is; but  we don't call them factories now, but Banded-workshops: that is, places  where people collect who want to work together.\"    \"I suppose,\" said I, \"power of some sort is used there?\"    \"No, no,\" said he.  \"Why should people collect together to use power,  when they can have it at the places where they live, or hard by, any two  or three of them; or any one, for the matter of that?  No; folk collect  in these Banded-workshops to do hand-work in which working together is  necessary or convenient; such work is often very pleasant.  In there, for  instance, they make pottery and glass,--there, you can see the tops of  the furnaces.  Well, of course it's handy to have fair-sized ovens and  kilns and glass-pots, and a good lot of things to use them for: though of  course there are a good many such places, as it would be ridiculous if a  man had a liking for pot-making or glass-blowing that he should have to  live in one place or be obliged to forego the work he liked.\"    \"I see no smoke coming from the furnaces,\" said I.    \"Smoke?\" said Dick; \"why should you see smoke?\"    I held my tongue, and he went on: \"It's a nice place inside, though as  plain as you see outside.  As to the crafts, throwing the clay must"]]]
