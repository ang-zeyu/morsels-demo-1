But this new governor clashed almost at once with the Assembly, tried  to make them pass a militia law, suggested that the province's trade to  foreign countries was illegal, persecuted and arrested members of the  Assembly, refused to submit new laws to it, and irritated the people by  suggesting the invalidity of their favorite laws. The Quaker Assembly  withstood and resisted him until they wore him out. After a year and  one month in office he resigned at Penn's request or, according to  some accounts, at his own request. At any rate, he expressed himself as  delighted to be relieved. As a Puritan soldier he found himself no match  for a peaceable Quaker Assembly.    Penn again made the Council the executive with Thomas Lloyd as its  President. But to the old causes of unrest a new one was now added.  One George Keith, a Quaker, turned heretic and carried a number of  Pennsylvania Quakers over to the Church of England, thereby causing  great scandal. The \"Lower Counties\" or Territories, as the present  State of Delaware was then called, became mutinous, withdrew their  representatives from the Council, and made William Markham their  Governor. This action together with the Keithian controversy, the  disturbances over Blackwell, and the clamors of Church of England people  that Penn was absent and neglecting his province, that the Quakers would  make no military defense, and that the province might at any time fall  into the hands of France, came to the ears of King William, who was  already ill disposed toward Penn and distrusted him as a Jacobite. It  seemed hardly advisable to allow a Jacobite to rule a British colony.  Accordingly a royal order suspended Penn's governmental authority and  placed the province under Benjamin Fletcher, Governor of New York.  He undertook to rule in dictatorial fashion, threatening to annex the  province to New York, and as a consequence the Assembly had plenty of  trouble with him. But two years later, 1694, the province was returned  to Penn, who now appointed as Governor William Markham, who had served  as lieutenant-governor under Fletcher.    Markham proceeded to be high-handed with the Assembly and to administer  the government in the imperialistic style of Fletcher. But the  Assembly soon tamed him and in 1696 actually worried out of him a new  constitution, which became known as Markham's Frame, proved much more  popular than the one Penn had given, and allowed the Assembly much more  power. Markham had no conceivable right to assent to it and Penn never  agreed to it; but it was lived under for the next four years until  Penn returned to the province. While it naturally had opponents, it  was largely regarded as entirely valid, and apparently with the  understanding that it was to last until Penn objected to it.    Penn had always been longing to return to Pennsylvania and live there  for the rest of his life; but the terrible times of the Revolution  of 1688 in England and its consequences had held him back. Those  difficulties had now passed. Moreover, William III had established free  government and religious liberty. No more Quakers were imprisoned and  Penn's old occupation of securing their protection and release was gone.    In the autumn of 1699 he sailed for Pennsylvania with his family and,  arriving after a tedious three months' voyage, was well received. His  political scrapes and mistakes in England seemed to be buried in the  past. He was soon at his old enjoyable life again, traveling actively  about the country, preaching to the Quakers, and enlarging and  beautifying his country seat, Pennsbury, on the Delaware, twenty miles  above Philadelphia. As roads and trails were few and bad he usually  traveled to and from the town in a barge which was rowed by six oarsmen  and which seemed to give him great pride and pleasure.    Two happy years passed away in this manner, during which Penn seems to  have settled, not however without difficulty, a great deal of business  with his people, the Assembly, and the Indian tribes. Unfortunately  he got word from England of a bill in Parliament for the revocation  of colonial charters and for the establishment of royal governments in  their place. He must needs return to England to fight it. Shortly before  he sailed the Assembly presented him with a draft of a new constitution  or frame of government which they had been discussing with him  and preparing for some time. This he accepted, and it became the  constitution under which Pennsylvania lived and prospered for  seventy-five years, until the Revolution of 1776.    This new constitution was quite liberal. The most noticeable feature of  it was the absence of any provision for the large elective council or  upper house of legislation, which had been very unpopular. The Assembly  thus became the one legislative body. There was incidental reference  in the document to a governor's council, although there was no formal  clause creating it. Penn and his heirs after his death always appointed  a small council as an advisory body for the deputy governor. The  Assembly was to be chosen annually by the freemen and to be composed of  four representatives from each county. It could originate bills, control  its own adjournments without interference from the Governor, choose its  speaker and other officers, and judge of the qualifications and  election of its own members. These were standard Anglo-Saxon popular  parliamentary rights developed by long struggles in England and now  established in Pennsylvania never to be relaxed. Finally a clause in the  constitution permitted the Lower Counties, or Territories, under  certain conditions to establish home rule. In 1705 the Territories took  advantage of this concession and set up an assembly of their own.    Immediately after signing the constitution, in the last days of October,  1701, Penn sailed for England, expecting soon to return. But he became  absorbed in affairs in England and never saw his colony again. This was  unfortunate because Pennsylvania soon became a torment to him instead of  a great pleasure as it always seems to have been when he lived in it. He  was a happy present proprietor, but not a very happy absentee one.    The Church of England people in Pennsylvania entertained great hopes  of this proposal to turn the proprietary colonies into royal provinces.  Under such a change, while the Quakers might still have an influence in  the Legislature, the Crown would probably give the executive offices to  Churchmen. They therefore labored hard to discredit the Quakers. They  kept harping on the absurdity of a set of fanatics attempting to govern  a colony without a militia and without administering oaths of office or  using oaths in judicial proceedings. How could any one's life be safe  from foreign enemies without soldiers, and what safeguard was there for  life, liberty, and property before judges, jurors, and witnesses, none  of whom had been sworn? The Churchmen kept up their complaints for along  time, but without effect in England. Penn was able to thwart all their  plans. The bill to change the province into a royal one was never passed  by Parliament. Penn returned to his court life, his preaching, and his  theological writing, a rather curious combination and yet one by which  he had always succeeded in protecting his people. He was a favorite  with Queen Anne, who was now on the throne, and he led an expensive life  which, with the cost of his deputy governor's salary in the colony, the  slowness of his quitrent collections, and the dishonesty of the steward  of his English estates, rapidly brought him into debt. To pay the  government expense of a small colonial empire and at the same time  to lead the life of a courtier and to travel as a preacher would have  exhausted a stronger exchequer than Penn's.    The contests between the different deputy governors, whom Penn or his  descendants sent out, and the Quaker Legislature fill the annals of  the province for the next seventy years, down to the Revolution. These  quarrels, when compared with the larger national political contests of  history, seem petty enough and even tedious in detail. But, looked at  in another aspect, they are important because they disclose how  liberty, self-government, republicanism, and many of the constitutional  principles by which Americans now live were gradually developed as  the colonies grew towards independence. The keynote to all these early  contests was what may be called the fundamental principle of colonial  constitutional law or, at any rate, of constitutional practice, namely,  that the Governor, whether royal or proprietary, must always be kept  poor. His salary or income must never become a fixed or certain sum but  must always be dependent on the annual favor and grants of a legislature  controlled by the people. This belief was the foundation of American  colonial liberty. The Assemblies, not only in Pennsylvania but in other  colonies, would withhold the Governor's salary until he consented to  their favorite laws. If he vetoed their laws, he received no salary. One  of the causes of the Revolution in 1776 was the attempt of the mother  country to make the governors and other colonial officials dependent  for their salaries on the Government in England instead of on the  legislatures in the colonies.    So the squabbles, as we of today are inclined to call them, went on  in Pennsylvania--provincial and petty enough, but often very large and  important so far as the principle which they involved was concerned. The  Legislature of Pennsylvania in those days was a small body composed of  only about twenty-five or thirty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#9)"],[1,"pulled close to his spine.  The holes  where the ball entered and went out again were clearly cut.  Another  man's skin was slightly burned by three bullets in three distinct lines,  as though it had been touched for an instant by the lighted end of a  cigar.  Greenway was shot through this shirt across the breast, and  Roosevelt was so close to one bullet, when it struck a tree, that it  filled his eyes and ears with tiny splinters.  Major Brodie and  Lieutenant Thomas were both wounded within a few feet of Colonel Wood,  and his color-sergeant, Wright, who followed close at his heels, was  clipped three times in the head and neck, and four bullets passed through  the folds of the flag he carried.  One trooper, Rowland, of Deming, was  shot through the lower ribs; he was ordered by Roosevelt to fall back to  the dressing station, but there Church told him there was nothing he  could do for him then, and directed him to sit down until he could be  taken to the hospital at Siboney.  Rowland sat still for a short time,  and then remarked restlessly, \"I don't seem to be doing much good here,\"  and picking up his carbine, returned to the firing-line.  There Roosevelt  found him.    \"I thought I ordered you to the rear,\" he demanded.    \"Yes, sir, you did,\" Rowland said, \"but there didn't seem to be much  doing back there.\"    After the fight he was sent to Siboney with the rest of the wounded, but  two days later he appeared in camp.  He had marched from Siboney, a  distance of six miles, and uphill all the way, carrying his carbine,  canteen, and cartridge-belt.    \"I thought you were in hospital,\" Wood said.  \"I was,\" Rowland answered  sheepishly, \"but I didn't seem to be doing any good there.\"    They gave him up as hopeless, and he continued his duties and went into  the fight of the San Juan hills with the hole still through his ribs.  Another cowboy named Heffner, when shot through the body, asked to be  propped up against a tree with his canteen and cartridge-belt beside him,  and the last his troop saw of him he was seated alone grimly firing over  their heads in the direction of the enemy.    Early in the fight I came upon Church attending to a young cowboy, who  was shot through the chest.  The entrance to his wound was so small that  Church could not insert enough of the gauze packing to stop the flow of  blood.    \"I'm afraid I'll have to make this hole larger,\" he said to the boy, \"or  you'll bleed to death.\"    \"All right,\" the trooper answered, \"I guess you know your business.\"  The  boy stretched out on his back and lay perfectly quiet while Church, with  a pair of curved scissors, cut away the edges of the wound.  His patient  neither whimpered nor swore, but stared up at the sun in silence.  The  bullets were falling on every side, and the operation was a hasty one,  but the trooper made no comment until Church said, \"We'd better get out  of this; can you stand being carried?\"    \"Do you think you can carry me?\" the trooper asked.    \"Yes.\"    \"Well,\" exclaimed the boy admiringly, \"you certainly know your business!\"    Another of the Rough Riders was brought to the dressing station with a  shattered ankle, and Church, after bandaging it, gave him his choice of  riding down to Siboney on a mule, or of being carried, a day later, on a  litter.    \"If you think you can manage to ride the mule with that broken foot,\" he  said, \"you can start at once, but if you wait until to-morrow, when I can  spare the men, you can be carried all the way.\"    The cowboy preferred to start at once, so six hospital stewards lifted  him and dropped him on the mule, and into a huge Mexican saddle.    He stuck his wounded ankle into one stirrup, and his untouched one into  the other, and gathered up the reins.    \"Does it pain you?  Can you stand it?\" Church asked anxiously.  The  cowboy turned and smiled down upon him with amused disdain.    \"Stand _this_?\" he cried.  \"Why, this is just like getting money from  home.\"    Toward the last, the firing from the enemy sounded less near, and the  bullets passed much higher.  Roosevelt, who had picked up a carbine and  was firing to give the direction to the others, determined upon a charge.  Wood, at the other end of the line, decided at the same time upon the  same manoeuvre.  It was called \"Wood's bluff\" afterward, for he had  nothing to back it with; while to the enemy it looked as though his whole  force was but the skirmish-line in advance of a regiment.  The Spaniards  naturally could not believe that this thin line which suddenly broke out  of the bushes and from behind trees and came cheering out into the hot  sunlight was the entire fighting force against it.  They supposed the  regiment was coming close on its heels, and as Spanish troops hate being  rushed as a cat hates water, they fired a few parting volleys and broke  and ran.  The cheering had the same invigorating effect on our own side  as a cold shower; it was what first told half the men where the other  half were, and it made every individual man feel better.  As we knew it  was only a bluff, the first cheer was wavering, but the sound of our own  voices was so comforting that the second cheer was a howl of triumph.    As it was, the Spaniards thought the Rough Riders had already disregarded  all the rules of war.    \"When we fired a volley,\" one of the prisoners said later, \"instead of  falling back they came forward.  That is not the way to fight, to come  closer at every volley.\"  And so, when instead of retreating on each  volley, the Rough Riders rushed at them, cheering and filling the hot air  with wild cowboy yells, the dismayed enemy retreated upon Santiago, where  he announced he had been attacked by the entire American army.    One of the residents of Santiago asked one of the soldiers if those  Americans fought well.    \"_Well_!\" he replied, \"they tried to catch us with their hands!\"    I have not attempted to give any account of General Young's fight on our  right, which was equally desperate, and, owing to the courage of the  colored troops of the Tenth in storming a ridge, equally worthy of  praise.  But it has seemed better not to try and tell of anything I did  not see, but to limit myself to the work of the Rough Riders, to whom,  after all, the victory was due, as it was owing to Colonel Wood's charge,  which took the Spaniards in flank, that General Wheeler and General Young  were able to advance, their own stubborn attack in front having failed to  dislodge the enemy from his rifle-pits.    According to the statement of the enemy, who had every reason not to  exaggerate the size of his own force, 4,000 Spaniards were engaged in  this action.  The Rough Riders numbered 534, and General Young's force  numbered 464.  The American troops accordingly attacked a force over four  times their own number intrenched behind rifle-pits and bushes in a  mountain pass.  In spite of the smokeless powder used by the Spaniards,  which hid their position, the Rough Riders routed them out of it, and  drove them back from three different barricades until they made their  last stand in the ruined distillery, whence they finally drove them by  assault.  The eager spirit in which this was accomplished is best  described in the Spanish soldier's answer to the inquiring civilian,  \"They tried to catch us with their hands.\"  The Rough Riders should adopt  it as their motto.        II--THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN HILL      After the Guasimas fight on June 24, the army was advanced along the  single trail which leads from Siboney on the coast to Santiago.  Two  streams of excellent water run parallel with this trail for short  distances, and some eight miles from the coast crossed it in two places.  Our outposts were stationed at the first of these fords, the Cuban  outposts a mile and a half farther on at the ford nearer Santiago, where  the stream made a sharp turn at a place called El Poso.  Another mile and  a half of trail extended from El Poso to the trenches of San Juan.  The  reader should remember El Poso, as it marked an important starting-point  against San Juan on the eventful first of July.    For six days the army was encamped on either side of the trail for three  miles back from the outposts.  The regimental camps touched each other,  and all day long the pack-trains carrying the day's rations passed up and  down between them.  The trail was a sunken wagon road, where it was  possible, in a few places, for two wagons to pass at one time, but the  greater distances were so narrow that there was but just room for a  wagon, or a loaded mule-train, to make its way.  The banks of the trail  were three or four feet high, and when it rained it was converted into a  huge gutter, with sides of mud, and with a liquid mud a foot deep between  them.  The camps were pitched along the trail as near the parallel stream  as possible, and in the occasional places where there was rich, high  grass.  At night the men slept in dog tents, open at the front and back,  and during the day spent their time under the shade of trees along the  trail, or on the banks of the stream.  Sentries were placed at every few  feet along these streams to guard them from any possible pollution.  For  six days the army rested in this way, for as an army moves and acts only  on its belly, and as the belly of this army was three miles long, it  could advance but slowly.    This week of rest, after the cramped life of the troop-ship, was not  ungrateful, although the rations were scarce and there was no tobacco,  which was as necessary to the health of the men as their food.    During this week of waiting, the chief excitement was to walk out a mile  and a half beyond the outposts to the hill of El Poso, and look across  the basin that lay in the great valley which leads to Santiago.  The left  of the valley was the hills which hide the sea.  The right of the valley  was the hills in which nestle the village of El Caney.  Below El Poso,"]]]
