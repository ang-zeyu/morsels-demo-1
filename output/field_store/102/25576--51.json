Emily followed slowly in the carriage.    On the way, St. Aubert asked his companion what success he had had  in the chase. 'Not much, sir,' he replied, 'nor do I aim at it. I am  pleased with the country, and mean to saunter away a few weeks among  its scenes. My dogs I take with me more for companionship than for game.  This dress, too, gives me an ostensible business, and procures me that  respect from the people, which would, perhaps, be refused to a lonely  stranger, who had no visible motive for coming among them.'    'I admire your taste,' said St. Aubert, 'and, if I was a younger man,  should like to pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly. I, too, am a  wanderer, but neither my plan nor pursuits are exactly like yours--I go  in search of health, as much as of amusement.' St. Aubert sighed, and  paused; and then, seeming to recollect himself, he resumed: 'If I can  hear of a tolerable road, that shall afford decent accommodation, it  is my intention to pass into Rousillon, and along the sea-shore to  Languedoc. You, sir, seem to be acquainted with the country, and can,  perhaps, give me information on the subject.'    The stranger said, that what information he could give was entirely at  his service; and then mentioned a road rather more to the east, which  led to a town, whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon.    They now arrived at the village, and commenced their search for a  cottage, that would afford a night's lodging. In several, which they  entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth seemed equally to prevail; and  the owners eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curiosity and timidity.  Nothing like a bed could be found, and he had ceased to enquire for  one, when Emily joined him, who observed the languor of her father's  countenance, and lamented, that he had taken a road so ill provided  with the comforts necessary for an invalid. Other cottages, which they  examined, seemed somewhat less savage than the former, consisting of  two rooms, if such they could be called; the first of these occupied by  mules and pigs, the second by the family, which generally consisted of  six or eight children, with their parents, who slept on beds of skins  and dried beech leaves, spread upon a mud floor. Here, light was  admitted, and smoke discharged, through an aperture in the roof; and  here the scent of spirits (for the travelling smugglers, who haunted the  Pyrenees, had made this rude people familiar with the use of liquors)  was generally perceptible enough. Emily turned from such scenes, and  looked at her father with anxious tenderness, which the young stranger  seemed to observe; for, drawing St. Aubert aside, he made him an offer  of his own bed. 'It is a decent one,' said he, 'when compared with  what we have just seen, yet such as in other circumstances I should be  ashamed to offer you.' St. Aubert acknowledged how much he felt himself  obliged by this kindness, but refused to accept it, till the young  stranger would take no denial. 'Do not give me the pain of knowing,  sir,' said he, 'that an invalid, like you, lies on hard skins, while  I sleep in a bed. Besides, sir, your refusal wounds my pride; I must  believe you think my offer unworthy your acceptance. Let me shew you the  way. I have no doubt my landlady can accommodate this young lady also.'    St. Aubert at length consented, that, if this could be done, he would  accept his kindness, though he felt rather surprised, that the stranger  had proved himself so deficient in gallantry, as to administer to the  repose of an infirm man, rather than to that of a very lovely young  woman, for he had not once offered the room for Emily. But she thought  not of herself, and the animated smile she gave him, told how much she  felt herself obliged for the preference of her father.    On their way, the stranger, whose name was Valancourt, stepped on first  to speak to his hostess, and she came out to welcome St. Aubert into a  cottage, much superior to any he had seen. This good woman seemed very  willing to accommodate the strangers, who were soon compelled to accept  the only two beds in the place. Eggs and milk were the only food the  cottage afforded; but against scarcity of provisions St. Aubert had  provided, and he requested Valancourt to stay, and partake with him of  less homely fare; an invitation, which was readily accepted, and they  passed an hour in intelligent conversation. St. Aubert was much pleased  with the manly frankness, simplicity, and keen susceptibility to the  grandeur of nature, which his new acquaintance discovered; and, indeed,  he had often been heard to say, that, without a certain simplicity of  heart, this taste could not exist in any strong degree.    The conversation was interrupted by a violent uproar without, in which  the voice of the muleteer was heard above every other sound. Valancourt  started from his seat, and went to enquire the occasion; but the dispute  continued so long afterwards, that St. Aubert went himself, and found  Michael quarrelling with the hostess, because she had refused to let his  mules lie in a little room where he and three of her sons were to pass  the night. The place was wretched enough, but there was no other for  these people to sleep in; and, with somewhat more of delicacy than was  usual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of country, she persisted  in refusing to let the animals have the same BED-CHAMBER with her  children. This was a tender point with the muleteer; his honour was  wounded when his mules were treated with disrespect, and he would have  received a blow, perhaps, with more meekness. He declared that his  beasts were as honest beasts, and as good beasts, as any in the whole  province; and that they had a right to be well treated wherever they  went. 'They are as harmless as lambs,' said he, 'if people don't affront  them. I never knew them behave themselves amiss above once or twice in  my life, and then they had good reason for doing so. Once, indeed, they  kicked at a boy's leg that lay asleep in the stable, and broke it; but  I told them they were out there, and by St. Anthony! I believe they  understood me, for they never did so again.'    He concluded this eloquent harangue with protesting, that they should  share with him, go where he would.    The dispute was at length settled by Valancourt, who drew the hostess  aside, and desired she would let the muleteer and his beasts have the  place in question to themselves, while her sons should have the bed of  skins designed for him, for that he would wrap himself in his cloak, and  sleep on the bench by the cottage door. But this she thought it her  duty to oppose, and she felt it to be her inclination to disappoint the  muleteer. Valancourt, however, was positive, and the tedious affair was  at length settled.    It was late when St. Aubert and Emily retired to their rooms, and  Valancourt to his station at the door, which, at this mild season, he  preferred to a close cabin and a bed of skins. St. Aubert was somewhat  surprised to find in his room volumes of Homer, Horace, and Petrarch;  but the name of Valancourt, written in them, told him to whom they  belonged.        CHAPTER IV         In truth he was a strange and wayward wight,    Fond of each gentle, and each dreadful scene,    In darkness, and in storm he found delight;    Nor less than when on ocean-wave serene    The southern sun diffus'd his dazzling sheen.    Even sad vicissitude amus'd his soul;    And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,    And down his cheek a tear of pity roll,   A sigh, a tear, so sweet, he wish'd not to controul.       THE MINSTREL    St. Aubert awoke at an early hour, refreshed by sleep, and desirous to  set forward. He invited the stranger to breakfast with him; and, talking  again of the road, Valancourt said, that, some months past, he had  travelled as far as Beaujeu, which was a town of some consequence on the  way to Rousillon. He recommended it to St. Aubert to take that route,  and the latter determined to do so.    'The road from this hamlet,' said Valancourt, 'and that to Beaujeu, part  at the distance of about a league and a half from hence; if you will  give me leave, I will direct your muleteer so far. I must wander  somewhere, and your company would make this a pleasanter ramble than any  other I could take.'    St. Aubert thankfully accepted his offer, and they set out together, the  young stranger on foot, for he refused the invitation of St. Aubert to  take a seat in his little carriage.    The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a pastoral  valley, bright with verdure, and varied with groves of dwarf oak,  beech and sycamore, under whose branches herds of cattle reposed. The  mountain-ash too, and the weeping birch, often threw their pendant  foliage over the steeps above, where the scanty soil scarcely concealed  their roots, and where their light branches waved to every breeze that  fluttered from the mountains.    The travellers were frequently met at this early hour, for the sun had  not yet risen upon the valley, by shepherds driving immense flocks from  their folds to feed upon the hills. St. Aubert had set out thus early,  not only that he might enjoy the first appearance of sunrise, but that  he might inhale the first pure breath of morning, which above all things  is refreshing to the spirits of the invalid. In these regions it was  particularly so, where an abundance of wild flowers and aromatic herbs  breathed forth their essence on the air.    The dawn, which softened the scenery with its peculiar grey tint, now  dispersed, and Emily watched the progress of the day, first trembling on  the tops of the highest cliffs, then touching them with splendid light,  while their sides and the vale below"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#9)"],[1,"field. But  listen, Bronze-head. If you get the best of Fermius, I'll give you a  full third of my winnings.\"    \"Thanks. You'll collect. A good man, Fermius, and smart. I've heard a  lot about him, but never saw him work. He has seen me, which isn't so  good. Both heavy and fast--somewhat lighter than I am, and a bit faster.  He knows that I always fight Thracian, and that I'd be a fool to try  anything else against him. He fights either Thracian or Samnite  depending upon the opposition. Against me his best bet would be to go  Samnite. Do you know?\"    \"No. They didn't say. He may not decide until the last moment.\"    \"Unlimited, against me, he'll go Samnite. He'll have to. These  unlimiteds are tough, but it gives me a chance to use a new trick I've  been working on. I'll take that sword there--no scabbard--and two  daggers, besides my gladius. Get me a mace; the lightest real mace  they've got in their armory.\"    \"A _mace_! Fighting _Thracian_, against a _Samnite_?\"    \"Exactly. A mace. Am I going to fight Fermius, or do you want to do it  yourself?\"    The mace was brought and Patroclus banged it, with a two-handed  roundhouse swing, against a stone of the wall. The head remained solid  upon the shaft. Good. They waited.    Trumpets blared; the roar of the vast assemblage subsided almost to  silence.    \"Grand Champion Fermius versus Grand Champion Patroclus,\" came the  raucous announcement. \"Single combat. Any weapons that either chooses to  use, used in any way possible. No rest, no intermission. Enter!\"    Two armored figures strode toward the center of the arena. Patroclus'  armor, from towering helmet down, and including the shield, was of  dully-gleaming steel, completely bare of ornament. Each piece was marred  and scarred; very plainly that armor was for use and had been used. On  the other hand, the Samnite half-armor of the Gaul was resplendent with  the decorations affected by his race. Fermius' helmet sported three  brilliantly-colored plumes, his shield and cuirass, enameled in half the  colors of the spectrum, looked as though they were being worn for the  first time.    Five yards apart, the gladiators stopped and wheeled to face the podium  upon which Nero lolled. The buzz of conversation--the mace had excited  no little comment and speculation--ceased. Patroclus heaved his  ponderous weapon into the air; the Gaul whirled up his long, sharp  sword. They chanted in unison:        \"Ave, Caesar Imperator!      Morituri te salutant!\"    The starting-flag flashed downward; and at its first sight, long before  it struck the ground, both men moved. Fermius whirled and leaped; but,  fast as he was, he was not quite fast enough. That mace, which had  seemed so heavy in the Thracian's hands a moment before, had become  miraculously maneuverable--it was hurtling through the air directly  toward the middle of his body! It did not strike its goal--Patroclus  hoped that he was the only one there who suspected that he had not  expected it to touch his opponent--but in order to dodge the missile  Fermius had to break his stride; lost momentarily the fine co-ordination  of his attack. And in that moment Patroclus struck. Struck, and struck  again.    But, as has been said, Fermius was both strong and fast. The first  blow, aimed backhand at his bare right leg, struck his shield instead.  The left-handed stab, shield-encumbered as the left arm was, ditto. So  did the next trial, a vicious forehand cut. The third of the mad flurry  of swordcuts, only partially deflected by the sword which Fermius could  only then get into play, sheared down and a red, a green, and a white  plume floated toward the ground. The two fighters sprang apart and  studied each other briefly.    From the gladiators' standpoint, this had been the veriest preliminary  skirmishing. That the Gaul had lost his plumes and that his armor showed  great streaks of missing enamel meant no more to either than that the  Thracian's supposedly surprise attack had failed. Each knew that he  faced the deadliest fighter of his world; but if that knowledge affected  either man, the other could not perceive it.    But the crowd went wild. Nothing like that first terrific  passage-at-arms had ever before been seen. Death, sudden and violent,  had been in the air. The arena was saturated with it. Hearts had been  ecstatically in throats. Each person there, man or woman, had felt the  indescribable thrill of death--vicariously, safely--and every fiber of  their lusts demanded more. More! Each spectator knew that one of those  men would die that afternoon. None wanted, or would permit them both to  live. This was to the death, and death there would be.    Women, their faces blotched and purple with emotion, shrieked and  screamed. Men, stamping their feet and waving their arms, yelled and  swore. And many, men and women alike, laid wagers.    \"Five hundred sesterces on Fermius!\" one shouted, tablet and stylus in  air.    \"Taken!\" came an answering yell. \"The Gaul is done--Patroclus all but  had him there!\"    \"One thousand, you!\" came another challenge. \"Patroclus missed his  chance and will never get another--a thousand on Fermius!\"    \"Two thousand!\"    \"Five thousand!\"    \"Ten!\"    The fighters closed--swung--stabbed. Shields clanged vibrantly under the  impact of fended strokes, swords whined and snarled. Back and  forth--circling--giving and taking ground--for minute after endless  minute that desperately furious exhibition of skill, of speed and of  power and of endurance went on. And as it went on, longer and longer  past the time expected by even the most optimistic, tension mounted  higher and higher.    Blood flowed crimson down the Gaul's bare leg and the crowd screamed its  approval. Blood trickled out of the joints of the Thracian's armor and  it became a frenzied mob.    No human body could stand that pace for long. Both men were tiring fast,  and slowing. With the drive of his weight and armor, Patroclus forced  the Gaul to go where he wanted him to go. Then, apparently gathering his  every resource for a final effort, the Thracian took one short, choppy  step forward and swung straight down, with all his strength.    The blood-smeared hilt turned in his hands; the blade struck flat and  broke, its length whining viciously away. Fermius, although staggered by  the sheer brute force of the abortive stroke, recovered almost  instantly; dropping his sword and snatching at his gladius to take  advantage of the wonderful opportunity thus given him.    But that breaking had not been accidental; Patroclus made no attempt to  recover his balance. Instead, he ducked past the surprised and shaken  Gaul. Still stooping, he seized the mace, which everyone except he had  forgotten, and swung; swung with all the totalized and synchronized  power of hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, and magnificent body.    The iron head of the ponderous weapon struck the center of the Gaul's  cuirass, which crunched inward like so much cardboard. Fermius seemed to  leave the ground and, folded around the mace, to fly briefly through the  air. As he struck the ground, Patroclus was upon him. The Gaul was  probably already dead--that blow would have killed an elephant--but that  made no difference. If that mob knew that Fermius was dead, they might  start yelling for his life, too. Hence, by lifting his head and poising  his dirk high in air, he asked of Caesar his Imperial will.    The crowd, already frantic, had gone stark mad at the blow. No thought  of mercy could or did exist in that insanely bloodthirsty throng; no  thought of clemency for the man who had fought such a magnificent fight.  In cooler moments they would have wanted him to live, to thrill them  again and yet again; but now, for almost half an hour, they had been  loving the hot, the suffocating thrill of death in their throats. Now  they wanted, and would have, the ultimate thrill.    \"Death!\" The solid structure rocked to the crescendo roar of the demand.  \"_Death_! DEATH!\"    Nero's right thumb pressed horizontally against his chest. Every vestal  was making the same sign. Pollice verso. Death. The strained and  strident yelling of the mob grew even louder.    Patroclus lowered his dagger and delivered the unnecessary and unfelt  thrust; and--    \"Peractum est!\" arose one deafening yell.           *       *       *       *       *    Thus the red-haired Thracian lived; and also, somewhat to his own  surprise, did Livius.    \"I'm glad to see you, Bronze-heart, by the white thighs of Ceres, I am!\"  that worthy exclaimed, when the two met, the following day. Patroclus  had never seen the Bithynian so buoyant. \"Pallas Athene covered you,  like I asked her to. But by the red beak of Thoth and the sacred Zaimph  of Tanit, it gave me the horrors when you made that throw so quick and  missed it, and I went as crazy as the rest of them when you pulled the  real coup. But now, curse it, I suppose that we'll all have to be on the  lookout for it--or no, unlimiteds aren't common, thank Ninib the Smiter  and his scarlet spears!\"    \"I hear you didn't do so badly, yourself,\" Patroclus interrupted his  friend's loquacity. \"I missed your first two, but I saw you take  Kalendios. He's a high-rater--one of the best of the locals--and I was  afraid he might snare you, but from the looks of you, you got only a  couple of stabs. Nice work.\"    \"Prayer, my boy. Prayer is the stuff. I prayed to 'em in order, and hit  the jackpot with Shamash. My guts curled up again, like they belong, and  I knew that the portents were all in my favor. Besides, when you were  walking out to meet Fermius, did you notice that red-headed Greek  posturer making passes at you?\"    \"Huh? Don't be a fool. I had other things to think of.\"    \"So I figured. So did she, probably, because after a while she came  around behind with a lanista and made eyes at me. I must have the next  best shape to you here, I guess. What a wench! Anyway, I felt"]]]
