If a slave woman had  children fast she was considered very valuable because slaves were  valuable property.    \"There was classes of slavery. Some of the half-white and beautiful  young women who were used by the marster and his men friends or who was  the sweetheart of the marster only, were given special privileges. Some  of 'em worked very little. They had private quarters well fixed up and  had a great influence over the marster. Some of these slave girls broke  up families by getting the marster so enmeshed in their net that his  wife, perhaps an older woman, was greatly neglected. Mother and  grandmother tole me that they were not allowed to pick their husbands.    \"Mother tole me that when she became a woman at the age of sixteen  years her marster went to a slave owner near by and got a six-foot  nigger man, almost an entire stranger to her, and told her she must  marry him. Her marster read a paper to them, told them they were man  and wife and told this negro he could take her to a certain cabin and  go to bed. This was done without getting her consent or even asking her  about it. Grandmother said that several different men were put to her  just about the same as if she had been a cow or sow. The slave owners  treated them as if they had been common animals in this respect.    \"Mother said she loved my father before the surrender and just as soon  as they were free they married. Grandmother was named Luna Williams.  She belonged to a planter who owned a large plantation and forty  slaves adjoining Mr. Cannon's plantation where mother and father  stayed. My grandmother on my mother's side lived to be 114 years old,  so they have tole me.    \"I ran away from home at the age of twelve years and went to  Charleston, South Carolina. I worked with a family there as waitin' boy  for one year. I then went to Savannah, Ga. I had no particular job and  I hoboed everywhere I went. I would wait all day by the side of the  railroad to catch a train at night. I rode freight trains and passenger  trains. I rode the blind baggage on passenger trains and the rods on  freight trains. The blind baggage is the car between the mail car and  the engine. The doors are on the side and none at the end. I hoboed on  to Miami over the Florida East Coast Railroad. I next went from Miami  to Memphis, Tenn. after staying there a few days and working with a  contractor, I again visited Charleston, S.C. I had been there only two  days when I met some Yankees from Minnesota. They prevailed on me to go  home with them, promising if I would do so they would teach me a trade.  I went with them. We all hoboed. We were halted at the Blue Ridge  mountains but we got by without going to jail. We then went to N.J.  From N.J. to Chicago, Ill., then into Milwaukee, Wis., then on into  Minneapolis, Minn. Many towns and cities I visited on this trip, I did  not know where I was. My Yankee companions looked out for me. They  taught me the trade of making chairs and other rustic furniture. They  taught me 164 ways of making different pieces of furniture. I spent 11  years in Minnesota but during that time I visited the South once every  three years, spending several days in the county of my birth. Mother  and father farmed all their lives and they often begged me to settle  down but the wanderlust had me and for 30 years I travelled from place  to place. Even while in Minnesota I did not stay in Minneapolis all the  time. I visited most every town in the state during the eleven years I  stayed there and made hobo trips into most of the adjoining states.    \"The main Yankee who taught me the trade was Joe Burton. He and the  gang helped me to get food until I learned the trade well enough so I  could make a living working at it.    \"I have made a lot of money making and selling rustic furniture, but  now I am getting old. I am not able to work as I used too. Not long ago  I made a trip from Raleigh to Charleston, S.C., but the trip was  different from the old days. I hitch-hiked the entire distance. I rode  with white folks. On one leg of the trip of over 200 miles I rode with  a rich young man and his two pals. They had a fruit jar full of bad  whiskey. He got about drunk, ran into a stretch of bad road at a high  rate of speed, threw me against the top of his car and injured my head.  I am not over it yet.    \"I quit the road in 1924. My last trip was from Raleigh, N.C. to  Harrisburg, Penn. and return. I have made my home in Raleigh ever  since. Done settled down, too ole to ramble anymore.\"    LE          N.C.

Route 1      \"My name is James Turner McLean. I was born in Harnett County near Cape  Fear River in the Buies Creek Section, Feb. 20, 1858. I belonged to  Taylor Hugh McLean, and he never was married. The plantation was  between Buies Creek and the Cape Fear river; the edge of it is about 75  yards from where I now live. The place where I live belongs to me. 'Way  back it belonged to the Bolden's.    \"The Boldens came from Scotland, and so did the McLeans. There were  about five hundred acres in this plantation and Marster Hugh McLean had  about fifty slaves. The slaves lived in quarters and Marster lived in  the big house which was his home. Marster took good care o' his  darkies. He did not allow anybody to whip 'em either. We had good food,  clothes and places to sleep. My father was Jim McLean and my mother was  named Charlotta McLean. My grandmother was named Jane. I called my  mother 'Sissie' and called my grandmother 'mammy' in slavery time. They  did not have me to do any heavy work just tending to the calves, colts,  and goin' to the post office.    \"The post office was at Mr. Sexton's and we called it Sexton's post  office, on the Raleigh and Fayetteville Road. The stage run on this  road and brought mail to this place. This post in my yard is part of a  stage coach axle. You see it? Yes sir, that's what it is. I got it at  Fayetteville when they were selling the old stage coach. We bought the  axle and wheels and made a cart. We got that stuff about 1870; my  father bought it. He gave twelve dollars for jes' the wheels and axle.  This was after we had taken the iron clad oath and become more  civilized.    \"We were daresome to be caught with a paper book or anything if we were  tryin' to learn to read and write. We had to have a pass to go around  on, or the patterollers would work on us. I saw a lot of patterollers.  Marster gave his Negroes a pass for twelve months. He sent his timber  to Wilmington, and worked timber at other places so he gave his slaves  yearly passes. Then when the war was about up me and him went to the  post office, and he got the paper. All the niggers were free. We  stopped on the way home at a large sassafras tree by the side o' the  road where he always stopped to read, and he read, and told me I was  free.    \"I did not know what it was or what it meant. We came on to the house  where my mother was and I said, 'Sissie, we is free.' She said, 'Hush,  or I will put the hickory on you.' I then went to grandma, the one I  called mammy and threw my arms around her neck and said, 'Mammy we are  free, what does it mean?' and mammy, who was grandma, said, 'You hush  sich talk, or I will knock you down wid a loom stick.'    \"Marster was comin' then, and he had the paper in his hand and was  cryin'. He came to the door and called grandma and said, 'You are free,  free as I am, but I want you to stay on. If you go off you will perish.  If you stay on now the crop is planted and work it, we will divide.'  Marster was cryin' and said, 'I do not own you any longer.' He told her  to get the horn and blow it. It was a ram's horn. She blew twice for  the hands to come to the house.    \"They were workin' in the river lowground about a mile or more away.  She blew a long blow, then another. Marster told her to keep blowin!  After awhile all the slaves come home; she had called them all in.  Marster met them at the gate, and told them to put all the mules up,  all the hoes and plows, that they were all free. He invited all to eat  dinner. He had five women cooking. He told them all he did not want  them to leave, but if they were going they must eat before they left.  He said he wanted everybody to eat all he wanted, and I remember the  ham, eggs, chicken, and other good things we had at that dinner. Then  after the dinner he spoke to all of us and said, 'You have nowhere to  go, nothin' to live on, but go out on my other plantation and build you  some shacks.'    \"He gave them homes and did not charge any rent. He bought nails and  lumber for them, but he would not build the houses. Some stayed with  him for fifteen years; some left. He gave them cows to milk. He said  the children must not perish.    \"Marster was a mighty good man, a feelin' man. He cried when some of  his slaves finally left him. Mother and father stayed till they got a  place of their own. I waited on him as long as he lived. I loved him as  well as I did my daddy. I drove for him and he kept me in his house  with him. He taught me to be honest, to tell the truth, and not to  steal anything.    \"When freedom came marster gave us a place for a school building and  furnished nails and gave the lumber for the floors. He instructed them  in building the windows. He was goin' to put his sister Jenette  McAllister in as teacher. She had married Jim McAllister at the Bluff  Church, right at the lower part of the Averysboro Battleground where  some of the last fightin' between the North and South was done, but a  man by the name of George Miller of Harnett County told him he knew a  nigger who could teach the school.

He stayed on at Cambridge to prepare  for Holy Orders, which the Society had agreed that he should receive.  The chiefs meanwhile were entertained at the houses of nobles and  prelates in different parts of the country, and at length were presented  to King George IV. \"How do you do, Mr. King George?\" said the  gentlemanly Hongi. \"How do you do, Mr. King Hongi?\" replied that easy  monarch. This was the kind of reception that the Maori appreciated, and  with the craft of his race he immediately seized his advantage. \"You  have ships and guns in plenty,\" said he to the King; \"have you said that  the New Zealanders are not to have any?\" \"Certainly not,\" replied His  Majesty, and gave him a suit of armour from the Tower. Hongi's object  was now attained. In spite of the missionaries he would have his guns,  and he would be a king.    This determination was not shaken by the Christianity which came under  the notice of the chiefs. At Norwich Cathedral they were given a seat in  the episcopal pew close to the altar, on the occasion of Kendall's  ordination. Hongi was chiefly impressed by the bishop's wig, which he  thought must be emblematic of wisdom. His conclusion was that the Church  was a very venerable institution and a necessary part of the English  State, but it did not seem to follow very consistently the doctrines  which he had heard proclaimed by the missionaries. Its official  representatives seemed to be on good terms with the world: why should he  be better than they? Like the king and great people of England he would  uphold the Church and--go his own way.    Marsden meanwhile had been working hard in the opposite direction. On  landing in February, 1820, he found that some of the missionaries had  been using muskets and powder as articles of barter. It was very hard to  avoid doing so, for the Maoris were no longer satisfied with hoes and  axes. Guns were becoming necessary to self-defence in New Zealand, and  guns they would have. Marsden took a firm stand and informed the chiefs  that if there were any more trading for firearms the mission would be  withdrawn. The Maoris were far too keenly alive to the advantages of  European settlement not to be alarmed at this threat. They agreed to  deal with the settlers by means of peaceful articles of commerce.    Marsden now began a wonderful series of journeys. His obligation to the  timber-cutters led him far up the Thames Valley, but he soon went on by  himself and reached Tauranga, where he found memories of Captain Cook.  Returning to his ship in the Thames estuary, he made more than one  expedition to Kaipara and the more northern parts of the island,  including places where no white man had hitherto been seen.[2] In these  journeys the Mokoia _pa_, which stood on the site of the present village  of Panmure, near Auckland, became a kind of pivot of his operations. Its  chief, Hinaki, was particularly friendly, and in him Marsden hoped to  find a second Ruatara, and in his village a basis for mission work  further south. In fact, all the people of this district seemed more  accessible to the appeal of religion than were those of the Bay of  Islands. From June to November the devoted missionary passed up and down  the waterways which encompass the present city of Auckland, as well as  overland to Hokianga and Whangaroa, preaching in the numerous villages  the simple truth of the one living and true GOD. After one of his  journeys he writes: \"I had now been twenty days from the ship, during  which time I had slept in my clothes, generally in the open air or in a  boat or canoe. A great part of the time the weather had been very wet  and stormy. I had crossed many swamps, creeks, and rivers, from the Bay  of Plenty[3] on the eastern side to Kaipara on the western coast; yet,  through the kind providence of God, I met with no accident or unpleasant  circumstances, but, on the contrary, had been highly gratified, and  returned to the ship in perfect health.\"      [2] Marsden's routes of travel during this time have been thoroughly    traced and elucidated by Dr. Hocken. In a biography or in a work on    the exploration of New Zealand a full account of these interesting    journeys should be given. But, for reasons which will presently    appear, they have hardly any importance for the history of the Church.    One Rembrandtesque passage may be quoted in which Marsden narrates his    visit to the _pa_ of Pataua, near Whangarei. This _pa_ was built high    above the sea, upon rocks which had \"the appearance of an old abbey in    ruins.... I was conducted up the narrow pass [writes Marsden] which I    could not ascend without assistance, the path was so steep and narrow.    When I had reached the top, I found a number of men, women, and    children sitting round their fires roasting snappers, crawfish, and    fern root. It was now quite dark. The roaring of the sea at the foot    of the _pa_, as the waves rolled into the deep caverns beneath the    high precipice upon which we stood, whose top and sides were covered    with huts, and the groups of natives conversing round their fires, all    tended to excite new and strange ideas for reflection.\"      [3] I have ventured to substitute this term for the \"Mercury Bay\" of    the original. It is clear that Marsden thought himself much further    north than he really was. Dr. Hocken proposes to read \"Towranga,\"    which, of course, means the same as my own emendation.    [Illustration: VIEW OF PAIHIA.]    Marsden's labours were indeed so great and so many-sided as to compel  the most sincere admiration. At one time he seems wholly given up to  trade, and on his first visit the Maoris were astonished to see him busy  with the aristocratic Nicholas in salting barrels of fish for export to  Sydney. At another time he is the adventurous explorer bearing  cheerfully the extremes of hot and cold, of wet and dry. Yet again he is  the sagacious counsellor and the resolute leader of men; and with it all  he is the warm-hearted Christian who can stay in the midst of his  labours to indite a letter to England, full of spiritual force and  sweetness. Wherever he passes he finds his God a very present help; he  lies down at night in the wet grass with feelings of adoring wonder at  the mysteries of redemption, and before his closing eyes there rises the  vision of the Cross of Jesus.    At his departure in December, Marsden left behind him a peaceful  community and an apparently prosperous mission. Butler had during the  year put into the ground the first plough ever used in New Zealand. The  Maoris were quiet, and the missionaries went to their beds at night  without any sense of insecurity. Four of the newly visited chiefs from  the Thames district followed Marsden at a short interval to Australia,  and stayed with him in his parsonage at Parramatta. Among these was  Hinaki of Mokoia, who wished to continue his journey to England. They  were still in the house when, in the following May, Hongi and Kendall  arrived on their return journey. It was the month of the death of the  great Napoleon at St. Helena, and it would almost seem as though a  portion of his spirit had passed into the Maori chief on his passage  through the Atlantic. At any rate Hongi began now to disclose his  purposes: \"Do not go to England,\" he said to Hinaki at Marsden's table;  \"you will surely be ill there. Better go home and see to your defences.  I shall come to visit you before long.\" All the presents which the great  people in England had showered upon him (excepting, of course, the suit  of armour) he now bartered for muskets and powder. A legend of his race  told how when the Maoris came from Hawaiki they were followed by an  invisible canoe in which sat the figure of Death. With more reason might  that grim form have been supposed to lurk now in the hold of the ship in  which Hongi and Hinaki sailed together to their native land.    They arrived there in the July of 1821, and the missionaries of Kerikeri  soon realised that they had a different Hongi to deal with. For a time  he held aloof from them, and when he did speak he showed great reserve.  Some allowance must of course be made for the inevitable disillusionment  of such a return. After the palaces of the bishops by whom he had been  entertained in England, the mission stations must have appeared even  startlingly humble. But the real grievance was the cessation of the  trade in firearms. The King had approved of this trade: why should the  missionaries object? Kendall in his new clerical attire seemed quite  willing to play the part of court-chaplain to the would-be king. \"I  would as soon,\" he said, \"trade with a musket as with a dollar.\"    The effects of the change were seen immediately. The Maoris grew  insolent, broke down the settlers' fences, and stole whatever they could  lay their hands on. This was, however, as nothing to that which  followed. Hongi and Hinaki had become reconciled on the ship, but a new  act of aggression soon called for reprisals, and at the head of an  immense naval armament Hongi set out for the waters of the Waitemata.  Clad in his helmet and coat of mail, he declaimed his wrongs before his  enemy's stockade at Mokoia, and was only saved by his armour from sudden  death by a treacherous bullet. Hinaki would grant no satisfaction; a  general assault took place, and after a desperate contest the _pa_ was  taken. Hongi swallowed his rival's eyes, and drank the blood that welled  from his throat. The taste of blood seemed to rouse the tiger in his  nature, and he proceeded to sweep the country with fire and sword.  \"Powerful tribes on both sides of the Thames were cut off, and for years  the whole country was deserted.\" The districts which Marsden had visited  so hopefully the year before were all reduced to desolation. The people  whom he had found so receptive of divine truth were now no longer to be  seen: they were either killed,"]]]
