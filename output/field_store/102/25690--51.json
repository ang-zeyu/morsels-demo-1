These \"date boils,\" or \"Baghdad boils,\" as they are sometimes called,  are not slow in attacking European strangers, and few, if any, escape  during their residence here. As no cause can reasonably be assigned  for them, so no cure has been found. Various remedies, including  cauterisation, have been tried, but without success, and it is now  thought wisest to do nothing more than keep them dry and clean, and  let them run their natural course, which lasts about a year. Happily  they are not so painful as ordinary boils. The malady appears at first  as a white point, not larger than a pin's head, and remains thus for  about three months. Then the flesh swells, becomes red and hard and  suppurates, and underneath a rough crust which is formed is corroded  and eaten away as by vitriol. On some strangers the fatal point  appears within a few days of their arrival.    In two years in the East I have not seen any European welcomed so  cordially as Dr. Sutton into Moslem homes. The _Hak[=i]m_, exhibiting  in \"quiet continuance in well-doing\" the legible and easily-recognised  higher fruits of Christianity, while refraining from harsh and  irreverent onslaughts on the creeds of those whose sufferings he  mitigates, is everywhere blessed.[7]    To my thinking, no one follows in the Master's footprints so closely  as the medical missionary, and on no agency for alleviating human  suffering can one look with more unqualified satisfaction. The  medical mission is the outcome of the living teachings of our faith. I  have now visited such missions in many parts of the world, and never  saw one which was not healing, helping, blessing; softening prejudice,  diminishing suffering, making an end of many of the cruelties which  proceed from ignorance, restoring sight to the blind, limbs to the  crippled, health to the sick, telling, in every work of love and of  consecrated skill, of the infinite compassion of Him who came \"not to  destroy men's lives, but to save them.\"    In one house Dr. Sutton was welcome because he had saved a woman's  life, in another because a blind youth had received his sight, and so  on. Among our visits was one to a poor Moslem family in a very poor  quarter. No matter how poor the people are, their rooms stand back  from the street, and open on yards more or less mean. It is a misnomer  to call this dwelling a house, or to write that it _opens_, for it is  merely an arched recess which can never be shut!    In a hole in the middle of an uneven earthen floor there was a fire of  tamarisk root and animal fuel, giving off a stinging smoke. On this  the broken wheat porridge for supper was being cooked in a copper pot,  supported on three rusty cannon-balls. An earthenware basin, a wooden  spoon, a long knife, a goat-skin of water, a mallet, a long hen-coop,  which had served as the bed for the wife when she was ill, some ugly  hens, a clay jar full of grain, two heaps of brick rubbish, and some  wadded quilts, which had taken on the prevailing gray-brown colour,  were the plenishings of the arch.    Poverty brings one blessing in Turkey--the poor man is of necessity a  monogamist. Wretched though the place was, it had the air of home, and  the smoky hole in the floor was a fireside. The wife was unveiled and  joined in the conversation, the husband was helping her to cook the  supper, and the children were sitting round or scrambling over their  parents' knees. All looked as happy as people in their class anywhere.  It is good to have ocular demonstration that such homes exist in  Turkey. God be thanked for them! The man, a fine frank-looking Turk,  welcomed Dr. Sutton jovially. He had saved the wife's life and was  received as their best friend. Who indeed but the medical missionary  would care for such as them and give them of his skill \"without money  and without price\"? The hearty laugh of this Turk was good to hear,  his wife smiled cordially, and the boys laughed like their father. The  eldest, a nice, bright fellow of nine, taught in the mosque school,  was proud to show how well he could read Arabic, and read part of a  chapter from St. John's Gospel, his parents looking on with wonder and  admiration.    Among the Christian families we called on were those of the dispenser  and catechist--people with very small salaries but comfortable homes.  These families were living in a house furnished like those of the rich  Armenians, but on a very simple scale, the floor and dais covered with  Persian carpets, the divan with Turkish woollen stuff, and there were  in addition a chair or two, and silk cushions on the floor. In one  room there were an intelligent elderly woman, a beautiful girl of  seventeen, married a few days ago, and wearing her bridal ornaments,  with her husband; another man and his wife, and two bright,  ruddy-cheeked boys who spoke six languages. All had \"date marks\" on  their faces. After a year among Moslems and Hindus, it was startling  to find men and women sitting together, the women unveiled, and taking  their share in the conversation merrily and happily. Even the young  bride took the initiative in talking to Dr. Sutton.    Of course the Christian women cover their faces in the streets, but  the covering is of different material and arrangement, and is really  magnificent, being of very rich, stiff, corded silk--self-coloured  usually--black, heliotrope, or dark blue, with a contrasting colour  woven in deep vandykes upon a white ground as a border. The silk is  superb, really capable of standing on end with richness. Such a sheet  costs about L5. The ambition of every woman is to possess one, and to  gratify it she even denies herself in the necessaries of life.    The upper classes of both Moslem and Christian women are rarely seen  on foot in the streets except on certain days, as when they visit the  churches and the mosques and burial-grounds. Nevertheless they go  about a great deal to visit each other, riding on white asses, which  are also used by _mollahs_ and rich elderly merchants. All asses have  their nostrils slit to improve their wind. A good white ass of long  pedigree, over thirteen hands high, costs as much as L50. As they are  groomed till they look as white as snow, and are caparisoned with red  leather trappings embroidered with gold thread and silks, and as a  rider on a white ass is usually preceded by runners who shout and  brandish sticks to clear the way, this animal always suggests  position, or at least wealth.    Women of the upper classes mounted on these asses usually go to pay  afternoon visits in companies, with mounted eunuchs and attendants,  and men to clear the way. They ride astride with short stirrups, but  the rider is represented only by a shapeless blue bundle, out of which  protrude two yellow boots. Blacks of the purest negro type frequently  attend on women, and indeed consequence is shown by the possession of  a number of them.    Of the Georgian and Circassian _belles_ of the harams, a single  lustrous eye with its brilliancy enhanced by the use of _kohl_ is all  that one sees. At the bottom of the scale are the Arab women and the  unsecluded women of the lower orders generally, who are of necessity  drudges, and are old hags before they are twenty, except in the few  cases in which they do not become mothers, when the good looks which  many of them possess in extreme youth last a little longer. If one's  memories of Baghdad women were only of those to be seen in the  streets, they would be of leathery, wrinkled faces, prematurely old,  figures which have lost all shape, and henna-stained hands crinkled  and deformed by toil.    Baghdad is busy and noisy with traffic. Great quantities of British  goods pass through it to Persia, avoiding by doing so the horrible  rock ladders between Bushire and Isfahan. The water transit from  England and India, only involving the inconvenience of transhipment at  Basrah, makes Baghdad practically into a seaport, with something of  the bustle and vivacity of a seaport, and caravans numbering from  20,000 to 26,000 laden mules are employed in the carriage of goods to  and from the Persian cities. A duty of one per cent is levied on goods  in transit to Persia.[8]    The trade of Baghdad is not to be despised. The principal articles  which were imported from Europe amounted in 1889 to a value of  L621,140, and from India to L239,940, while the exports from Baghdad  to Europe and America were valued in the same year at L469,200, and  to India by British India Company steamers only at L35,150. In looking  through the Consular list of exports, it is interesting to notice that  13,400 cwts. of gum of the value of L70,000 were exported in 1889.  Neither the Indian postage stamps nor ours should suffer from the  partial failure of the Soudan supply.    Liquorice roots to the value of L7800 were exported in 1888, almost  solely to America, to be used in the preparation of quid tobacco and  \"fancy drinks\"!    The gall nuts which grow in profusion on the dwarf oaks which cover  many hillsides, were exported last year to the value of L35,000, to be  used chiefly in the production of ink, so closely is commerce binding  countries one to the other.    Two English firms have concessions for pressing wool and making it  into bales suitable for shipment. There are five principal English  firms here, three French, and six Turkish, not including the small  fry. There are five foreign Consulates.    The carriage of goods is one of the most important of Persian and  Turkish industries, and the breeding of mules and the manufacture of  caravan equipments give extensive employment; but one shudders to  think of the amount of suffering involved in sore backs and wounds,  and of exhausted and over-weighted animals lying down forlornly to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#9)"],[1,"bulbs, send down their roots very deep.    After leaving camp yesterday and crossing a high pass we descended  into the earth's interior, only to ascend a second pass by a steep  zigzag. Suddenly a wall of rock appeared as if to bar progress, but on  nearing it a narrow V-shaped slit was seen to afford a risky passage,  offering no other foothold than smooth shelving rock on the inside for  a number of yards, with a precipice above on the right and below on  the left. Ledges of slippery rock led up to it, and _Screw_ was  jumping and scrambling up these when the guides howled to me to stop,  and I was lifted off somehow. The white Arab was rolling and  struggling in the V, _Screw_ following lost his footing, and the two  presented a confusion of hoofs and legs in the air and bodies  struggling and rolling through the slit till they picked themselves up  with cut legs. The guides tried vainly to find some way by which the  caravans which followed much later might avoid this risk, and the Agha  went down the pass which had been so laboriously ascended to give  directions for its passage.    The _charvadars_ on reaching the difficulty made attempts to turn it  but failed; some loads were taken off and carried by men, and each  mule struggled safely through with one man at his head, and one or  two supporting him by his tail. The passage of the V took the caravan  an hour, but meantime there was the enjoyment of the sight of a  confused mass of mountains, whitish precipitous ranges, sun-lit, with  tremendous ravines between them, lying in the cool blue shadows of  early morning; mountains with long straight summits, mountains  snow-covered and snow-slashed, great spires of naked rock, huge ranges  buttressed by huge spurs herbage-covered, with outcrops of barren  rock,--a mighty, solitary, impressive scene, an uplifted wilderness  without a camp.    The descent of 4000 feet from this summit consists of any number of  zigzag tracks on the narrow top of the narrow ridge of one of the huge  rocky buttresses of Gartak, both sides being precipitous. Even on the  horse I was dizzy, and he went down most unwillingly, not taking any  responsibility as to finding the safest way, and depending solely on  my eye and hand. Mirza, being hampered with the care of his own mule,  was useless, and otherwise I was alone. These thready zigzags ended on  what appeared to be a precipice, from the foot of which human voices  came up, shouting to me to dismount. I did so, and got down, hanging  on to _Screw's_ bridle, and letting myself down over the ledges by my  hands for another hour, having to be careful all the time to avoid  being knocked down by his slips and jumps. I could hardly get him to  face some of the smooth broken faces of rock. A slide of gravel, a  snow-bridge, worn thin, over a torrent, and some slippery rock ledges  to scramble over by its side led to a pathless ascent through grass  and bushes. The guides and Aziz roared to me from a valley below, by  which roars I found my way down a steep hillside to the Gokun, a  mountain river of a unique and most beautiful blue-green colour,  abounding in deep pools from which it emerges in billows of cool  foam.    I forded it by a broad ford where crystal-green water glides calmly  over brown and red pebbles, with a willow-shaded margin, and as I  crossed a flock of long-bearded goats swam and jumped from rock to  rock from the other side, the whole scene an artist's dream. This  valley has magnificent pasturage, hay not yet \"sun cured,\" long grass,  and abundant clover and vetches brightened by a profuse growth of a  small _helianthus_.    The march over the Gokun Pass and down to the Gokun river is the worst  I ever made. Had the track been in Ladak or Lahoul it would have been  marked on the Government maps \"impassable for laden animals.\" Yet  Hadji's splendid mules, held at times by both head and tail,  accomplished it, and only minor disasters occurred. One mule had his  head gashed, Mirza had a bad fall, and broke my milk bottle, Hassan,  leading his own horse, fell twenty feet with the animal and cut his  arm, the ridge pole of my tent was broken, and is with difficulty  bandaged so as to hold, and some of the other baggage was damaged.  Hadji grumbles politely, and says that \"in all time loaded mules were  never taken over such tracks,\" and I believe him. Aziz says that I  must be \"tired of life,\" or I should never ride over them, and  certainly _Screw_ carried me at the peril of his life and mine.    The camps are pitched for Sunday at an altitude of 8000 feet, high  above the river--mine under the befriending shade of a colossal  natural sphinx, so remarkable that two photographs and a sketch by  Mirza were taken of it. It confronted us in a startling way, a grand  man's head with a flowing wig and a legal face, much resembling the  photographs of Lord Chancellor Hatherley.    The mules have been poorly fed for the last few days, and it is  pleasant to see them revelling in the abundant pasturage. After this  tremendous nine hours' march they came in quite cheerily, Cock o' the  Walk leading the caravan, with his fighting face on, shaking his grand  mane, and stamping as if he had not walked a mile.    The Sunday has been a very quiet one, except for the fighting of the  horses, which seem intent on murdering each other, the fussiness of  Aziz about a cut which his mare got yesterday, and for which he  expects my frequent attention, and the torment of the sand-flies,  which revel in the heat which kills the mosquitos.    _Kalahoma, July 11._--On Monday it was a pretty march from the shadow  of the sphinx through a well-irrigated and cultivated valley with many  camps, and by a high pass, to the neighbourhood of the Kuh-i-Shahan,  on which I rested for some hours at a height of 12,010 feet, the  actual summit being somewhat higher. On its north-east side the view  was hideous, of scorched, rolling gravel hills and wide scorched  valleys, with two winding streams, and some patches of wheat  surrounding two scorched mud villages.    The descent to Camp Kamarun, a deep ravine with a rapid mountain  stream, was blessed by a shower, which cooled the air, and resulted in  the only grand, stormy, wild sunset that I have seen for months. This  valley is blocked at the east end by Gargunaki, on the west by the  Kala Kuh, and the rocky ranges of Faidun and the Kuh-i-Shahan close in  its sides.    Long, long ago tradition says a certain great chief had eleven sons.  They quarrelled and divided into hostile factions of four and seven,  forming the still hostile groups of the Chahar Lang and the Haft Lang  of to-day. For some time past the ruling dynasty has been of the Haft  Lang division; Aziz also belongs to it, and we have been almost  entirely among its tribes hitherto. This ancient feud, though modified  in intensity, still exists. At this camp we were among tribes of the  Chahar Lang, and there was reason to apprehend robbery and a night  attack; so careful arrangements were made, and the men kept guard by  turns.    The following day's march, which was also pretty, included a long  descent through a cultivated valley, with willows, plums, and walnuts  growing along a stream, and a steep ascent and descent to the two  villages of Masir on well-cultivated slopes, belonging to Taimur Khan,  the chief of the powerful Magawe tribe, to whom the villagers pay what  they call a moderate \"rent\" in sheep, goats, and grain. They are of  the Chahar Lang, and deny that they are under the Ilkhani's rule. They  had a fight with a tribe of the Haft Lang ten days ago, killed twelve  men, had seven killed and wounded, and took some guns and horses.  These, however, they have restored at the command of the Ilkhani,  which contradicts their assertion.    They have a burial-ground with several very white lions rampant upon  it, of most noble aspect, boldly carved, and with the usual  bas-reliefs on their sides.    The camps were on a gravelly slope with a yellow glare, and the  mercury reached 105 deg. The presence of villages in this country always  indicates a comparatively warm climate, in which people can live  throughout the winter. The Scripture phrase, \"maketh the outgoings of  the morning and evening to rejoice,\" has come to bear a clear and  vivid meaning. In this country, in this fiery latitude, life is merely  a struggle from the time the sun has been up for two hours until he  sinks very low. \"There is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\" One  watches with dismay his flaming disc wheel into the cloudless sky, to  blaze and scintillate mercilessly there for many terrible hours,  scorching, withering, destroying, \"turning a fruitful land into a  desert,\" bringing eye diseases in his train. With sunset, but not much  before, comes a respite, embittered by sand-flies, and life begins to  be possible; then darkness comes with a stride and the day is done.    Among the many people who came to the _Hak[=i]m_ was a man who had  received a severe sword cut in the recent fight. I disliked his  expression, and remarked on it to Mirza. On the next day's march,  though there were twelve men with the caravan, this man seized and  made off with the handsome chestnut horse Karun, which was being led.  The horse had a sore back and soon kicked off his rider and was  recovered. On the same march Mujid was attacked, and under the threat  of being stripped was obliged to give up all the money he had on his  person. On the same day some women clamorously demanded bracelets, and  when I did not give them two took hold of my bridle and one of my  foot, and were dragging me off, when on Mirza coming up they let me  go.    Marching among lower hills and broader valleys, irrigated and  cultivated, with much wood along the streams and scattered on the  lower slopes, we passed the inhabited villages of Tarsa and Sah Kala,  surrounded by patches of buckwheat, vetches, and melons, and with much  provision"]]]
