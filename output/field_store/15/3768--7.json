CHAPTER V    MORE ABOUT THE MEDICINE MEN AND LEECHCRAFT      The wirreenuns sometimes hold meetings which they allow  non-professionals to attend. At these the spirits of the dead speak  through the medium of those they liked best on earth, and whose bodies  their spirits now animate. These spirits are known as Yowee, the  equivalent of our soul, which never leave the body of the living,  growing as it grows, and when it dies take judgment for it, and can at  will assume its perishable shape unless reincarnated in another form.  So you see each person has at least three spirits, and some four, as  follows: his Yowee, soul equivalent; his Doowee, a dream spirit; his  Mulloowil, a shadow spirit; and may be his Yunbeai, or animal spirit.    Sometimes one person is so good a medium as to have the spirits of  almost any one amongst the dead people speak through him or her, in the  whistling spirit voice.    I think it is very clever of these mediums to have decided that spirits  all have one sort of voice.    At these meetings there would be great rivalry among the wirreenuns.  The one who could produce the most magical stones would be supposed to  be the most powerful. The strength of the stones in them, whether  swallowed or rubbed in through their heads, adds its strength to  theirs, for these stones are living spirits, as it were, breathing and  growing in their fleshly cases, the owner having the power to produce  them at any time. The manifestation of such power is sometimes, at one  of these trials of magic, a small shower of pebbles as seeming to fall  from the heads and mouths of the rivals, and should by chance any one  steal any of these as they fall, the power of the original possessor  would be lessened. The dying bequeath these stones, their most precious  possessions, to the living wirreenun most nearly related to them.    The wirreenun's health and power not only depend upon his crystals and  yunbeai, but also on his Minggah; should an accident happen to that,  unless he has another, he will die--in any case, he will sicken. Many of  the legends deal with the magic of these spirit-animated trees.    They are places of refuge in time of danger; no one save the wirreenun,  whose spirit-tree it was, would dare to touch a refugee at a Minggah;  and should the sanctuary be a Goomarh, or spirit-stone, not even a  wirreenun would dare to interfere, so that it is a perfectly safe  sanctuary from humanly dealt evil. But a refugee at a Minggah or  Goomarh runs a great risk of incurring the wrath of the spirits, for  Minggah are taboo to all but their own wirreenun.    There was a Minggah, a great gaunt Coolabah, near our river garden.  Some gilahs build in it every year, but nothing would induce the most  avaricious of black bird-collectors to get the young ones from there.    A wirreenun's boondoorr, or dillee bag, holds a queer collection:  several sizes of gooweeras, of both bone and wood, poison-stones,  bones, gubberahs (sacred stones), perhaps a dillee--the biggest, most  magical stone used for crystal-gazing, the spirit out of which is said  to go to the person of whom you want to hear, wherever he is, to see  what he is doing, and then show you the person in the crystal. A  dinahgurrerhlowah, or moolee, death-dealing stone, which is said to  knock a person insensible, or strike him dead as lightning would by an  instantaneous flash.    To these are added in this miscellaneous collection medicinal herbs,  nose-bones to put through the cartilage of his nose when going to a  strange camp, so that he will not smell strangers easily. The blacks  say the smell of white people makes them sick; we in our arrogance had  thought it the other way on.    Swansdown, shells, and woven strands of opossum's hair are valuable,  and guarded as such in the boondoorr, which is sometimes kept for  safety in the wirreenun's Minggah.    Having dealt with the supernatural part of a wirreenun's training,  which argues cunning in him and credulity in others, I must get to his  more natural remedies.    Snakebite they cure by sucking the wound and cauterising it with a  firestick. They say they suck out the young snakes which have been  injected into the bitten person.    For headaches or pains which do not yield to the vegetable medicine,  the wirreenuns tie a piece of opossum's hair string round the sore  place, take one end in their mouths, and pull it round and round until  it draws blood along the cord. For rheumatic pains in the head or in  the small of the back and loins they often bind the places affected  with coils of opossum hair cord, as people do sometimes with red  knitting-silk.    The blacks have many herbal medicines, infusions of various barks,  which they drink or wash themselves with, as the case may be.    Various leaves they grind on their dayoorl-stones, rubbing themselves  with the pulp. Steam baths they make of pennyroyal, eucalyptus, pine,  and others.    The bleeding of wounds they stanch with the down of birds.    For irritations of the skin they heat dwarf saltbush twigs and put the  hot ends on the irritable parts.    After setting a broken limb they put grass and bark round it, then bind  it up.    For swollen eyes they warm the leaves of certain trees and hold them to  the affected parts, or make an infusion of Budtha leaves and bathe the  eyes in it.    For rheumatic pains a fire is made, Budtha twigs laid on it, a little  water thrown on them; the ashes raked out, a little more water thrown  on, then the patient lies on top, his opossum rug spread over him, and  thus his body is steamed. To induce perspiration, earth or sand is also  often heated and placed in a hollowed-out space; on it the patient  lies, and is covered with more heated earth.    Pennyroyal infused they consider a great blood purifier they also use a  heap as a pillow if suffering from insomnia. It is hard to believe a  black ever does suffer from insomnia, yet the cure argues the fact.    Beefwood gum is supposed to strengthen children. It is also used for  reducing swollen joints. A hole is made in the ground, some coals put  in, on them some beefwood leaves, on top of them the gum; over the hole  is put enough bark to cover it with a piece cut out of it the size of  the swollen joint to be steamed, which joint is held over this hole.    Various fats are also used as cures. Iguana fat for pains in the head  and stiffness anywhere. Porcupine and opossum fats for preserving their  hair, fish fat to gloss their skins, emu fat in cold weather to save  their skins from chapping.    But what is supposed to strengthen them more than anything, both  mentally and physically, is a small piece of the flesh of a dead  person, or before a body is put in a bark coffin a few incisions were  made in it; when it was coffined it was stood on end, and what drained  from the incisions was caught in small wirrees and drunk by the  mourners.    I fancy such cannibalism as has been in these tribes was not with a  view to satisfaction of appetite but to the incorporation of additional  strength. Either men or women are allowed to assist in this  particularly nauseating funeral rite, but not the young people.    Nor must their shadows fall across any one who has partaken of this  rite; should they do so some evil will befall them.    If the mother of a young child has not enough milk for its sustenance,  she is steamed over 'old man' saltbush, and hot twigs of it laid on her  breasts. To expedite the expulsion of the afterbirth, an old woman  presses the patient round the waist, gives her frequent drinks of cold  water, and sprinkles water over her. As soon as the afterbirth is  removed a steam is prepared. Two logs are laid horizontally, some  stones put in between them, then some fire, on top leaves of  eucalyptus, and water is then sprinkled over them. The patient stands  astride these logs, an opossum rug all over her, until she is well  steamed. After this she is able to walk about as if nothing unusual had  happened. Every night for about a month she has to lie on a steam bed  made of damped eucalyptus leaves. She is not allowed to return to the  general camp for about three months after the birth of her child.    Though perfectly well, she is considered unclean, and not allowed to  touch anything belonging to any one. Her food is brought to her by some  old woman. Were she to touch the food or food utensils of another they  would be considered unclean and unfit for use. Her camp is gailie--that  is, only for her; and she is goorerwon as soon as her child is born--a  woman unclean and apart. Immediately a' baby is born it is washed in  cold water.    Ghastly traditions the blacks have of the time when Dunnerh-Dunnerh,  the smallpox, decimated their ancestors. Enemies sent it in the winds,  which hung it on the trees, over the camps, whence it dropped on to its  victims. So terror-stricken were the tribes that, with few exceptions,  they did not stay to bury their dead; and because they did not do so,  flying even from the dying, a curse was laid on them that some day the  plague would return, brought back by the Wundah or white devils; and  the blacks shudder still, though it was generations before them, at the  thought that such a horror may come again.    Poison-stones are ground up finely and placed in the food of the person  desired to be got rid of. These poison-stones are of two kinds, a  yellowish-looking stone and a black one; they cause a lingering death.  The small bones of the wrist of a dead person are also pounded up and  put into food, in honey or water, as a poison.    One cure struck me as quaint. The patient may be lying down, when up  will come one of the tribe, most likely a wirreenun with a big piece of  bark.

The Firth seems a leaden creek, that a man might almost jump  across, between well-powdered Lothian and well-powdered Fife.  And the  effect is not, as in other cities, a thing of half a day; the streets are  soon trodden black, but the country keeps its virgin white; and you have  only to lift your eyes and look over miles of country snow.  An  indescribable cheerfulness breathes about the city; and the well-fed  heart sits lightly and beats gaily in the--bosom.  It is New-year's  weather.    New-year's Day, the great national festival, is a time of family  expansions and of deep carousal.  Sometimes, by a sore stoke of fate for  this Calvinistic people, the year's anniversary fails upon a Sunday, when  the public-houses are inexorably closed, when singing and even whistling  is banished from our homes and highways, and the oldest toper feels  called upon to go to church.  Thus pulled about, as if between two  loyalties, the Scotch have to decide many nice cases of conscience, and  ride the marches narrowly between the weekly and the annual observance.  A party of convivial musicians, next door to a friend of mine, hung  suspended in this manner on the brink of their diversions.  From ten  o'clock on Sunday night, my friend heard them tuning their instruments:  and as the hour of liberty drew near, each must have had his music open,  his bow in readiness across the fiddle, his foot already raised to mark  the time, and his nerves braced for execution; for hardly had the twelfth  stroke sounded from the earliest steeple, before they had launced forth  into a secular bravura.    Currant-loaf is now popular eating in all house-holds.  For weeks before  the great morning, confectioners display stacks of Scotch bun--a dense,  black substance, inimical to life--and full moons of shortbread adorned  with mottoes of peel or sugar-plum, in honour of the season and the  family affections.  'Frae Auld Reekie,' 'A guid New Year to ye a',' 'For  the Auld Folk at Hame,' are among the most favoured of these devices.  Can you not see the carrier, after half-a-day's journey on pinching  hill-roads, draw up before a cottage in Teviotdale, or perhaps in Manor  Glen among the rowans, and the old people receiving the parcel with moist  eyes and a prayer for Jock or Jean in the city?  For at this season, on  the threshold of another year of calamity and stubborn conflict, men feel  a need to draw closer the links that unite them; they reckon the number  of their friends, like allies before a war; and the prayers grow longer  in the morning as the absent are recommended by name into God's keeping.    On the day itself, the shops are all shut as on a Sunday; only taverns,  toyshops, and other holiday magazines, keep open doors.  Every one looks  for his handsel.  The postman and the lamplighters have left, at every  house in their districts, a copy of vernacular verses, asking and  thanking in a breath; and it is characteristic of Scotland that these  verses may have sometimes a touch of reality in detail or sentiment and a  measure of strength in the handling.  All over the town, you may see  comforter'd schoolboys hasting to squander their half-crowns.  There are  an infinity of visits to be paid; all the world is in the street, except  the daintier classes; the sacramental greeting is heard upon all sides;  Auld Lang Syne is much in people's mouths; and whisky and shortbread are  staple articles of consumption.  From an early hour a stranger will be  impressed by the number of drunken men; and by afternoon drunkenness has  spread to the women.  With some classes of society, it is as much a  matter of duty to drink hard on New-year's Day as to go to church on  Sunday.  Some have been saving their wages for perhaps a month to do the  season honour.  Many carry a whisky-bottle in their pocket, which they  will press with embarrassing effusion on a perfect stranger.  It is  inexpedient to risk one's body in a cab, or not, at least, until after a  prolonged study of the driver.  The streets, which are thronged from end  to end, become a place for delicate pilotage.  Singly or arm-in-arm, some  speechless, others noisy and quarrelsome, the votaries of the New Year go  meandering in and out and cannoning one against another; and now and  again, one falls and lies as he has fallen.  Before night, so many have  gone to bed or the police office, that the streets seem almost clearer.  And as _guisards_ and _first-footers_ are now not much seen except in  country places, when once the New Year has been rung in and proclaimed at  the Tron railings, the festivities begin to find their way indoors and  something like quiet returns upon the town.  But think, in these piled  _lands_, of all the senseless snorers, all the broken heads and empty  pockets!    Of old, Edinburgh University was the scene of heroic snowballing; and one  riot obtained the epic honours of military intervention.  But the great  generation, I am afraid, is at an end; and even during my own college  days, the spirit appreciably declined.  Skating and sliding, on the other  hand, are honoured more and more; and curling, being a creature of the  national genius, is little likely to be disregarded.  The patriotism that  leads a man to eat Scotch bun will scarce desert him at the curling-pond.  Edinburgh, with its long, steep pavements, is the proper home of sliders;  many a happy urchin can slide the whole way to school; and the profession  of errand-boy is transformed into a holiday amusement.  As for skating,  there is scarce any city so handsomely provided.  Duddingstone Loch lies  under the abrupt southern side of Arthur's Seat; in summer a shield of  blue, with swans sailing from the reeds; in winter, a field of ringing  ice.  The village church sits above it on a green promontory; and the  village smoke rises from among goodly trees.  At the church gates, is the  historical _joug_; a place of penance for the neck of detected sinners,  and the historical _louping-on stane_, from which Dutch-built lairds and  farmers climbed into the saddle.  Here Prince Charlie slept before the  battle of Prestonpans; and here Deacon Brodie, or one of his gang, stole  a plough coulter before the burglary in Chessel's Court.  On the opposite  side of the loch, the ground rises to Craigmillar Castle, a place  friendly to Stuart Mariolaters.  It is worth a climb, even in summer, to  look down upon the loch from Arthur's Seat; but it is tenfold more so on  a day of skating.  The surface is thick with people moving easily and  swiftly and leaning over at a thousand graceful inclinations; the crowd  opens and closes, and keeps moving through itself like water; and the ice  rings to half a mile away, with the flying steel.  As night draws on, the  single figures melt into the dusk, until only an obscure stir, and coming  and going of black clusters, is visible upon the loch.  A little longer,  and the first torch is kindled and begins to flit rapidly across the ice  in a ring of yellow reflection, and this is followed by another and  another, until the whole field is full of skimming lights.          CHAPTER X. TO THE PENTLAND HILLS.      On three sides of Edinburgh, the country slopes downward from the city,  here to the sea, there to the fat farms of Haddington, there to the  mineral fields of Linlithgow.  On the south alone, it keeps rising until  it not only out-tops the Castle but looks down on Arthur's Seat.  The  character of the neighbourhood is pretty strongly marked by a scarcity of  hedges; by many stone walls of varying height; by a fair amount of  timber, some of it well grown, but apt to be of a bushy, northern profile  and poor in foliage; by here and there a little river, Esk or Leith or  Almond, busily journeying in the bottom of its glen; and from almost  every point, by a peep of the sea or the hills.  There is no lack of  variety, and yet most of the elements are common to all parts; and the  southern district is alone distinguished by considerable summits and a  wide view.    From Boroughmuirhead, where the Scottish army encamped before Flodden,  the road descends a long hill, at the bottom of which and just as it is  preparing to mount upon the other side, it passes a toll-bar and issues  at once into the open country.  Even as I write these words, they are  being antiquated in the progress of events, and the chisels are tinkling  on a new row of houses.  The builders have at length adventured beyond  the toll which held them in respect so long, and proceed to career in  these fresh pastures like a herd of colts turned loose.  As Lord  Beaconsfield proposed to hang an architect by way of stimulation, a man,  looking on these doomed meads, imagines a similar example to deter the  builders; for it seems as if it must come to an open fight at last to  preserve a corner of green country unbedevilled.  And here, appropriately  enough, there stood in old days a crow-haunted gibbet, with two bodies  hanged in chains.  I used to be shown, when a child, a flat stone in the  roadway to which the gibbet had been fixed.  People of a willing fancy  were persuaded, and sought to persuade others, that this stone was never  dry.  And no wonder, they would add, for the two men had only stolen  fourpence between them.    For about two miles the road climbs upwards, a long hot walk in summer  time.  You reach the summit at a place where four ways meet, beside the  toll of Fairmilehead.  The spot is breezy and agreeable both in name and  aspect.  The hills are close by across a valley: Kirk Yetton, with its  long, upright scars visible as far as Fife, and Allermuir the tallest on  this side with wood and tilled field running high upon their borders, and  haunches all moulded into innumerable glens and shelvings and variegated  with heather and"]]]
