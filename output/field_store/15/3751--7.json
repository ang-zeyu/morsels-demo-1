Few individuals retained the caruncle when they  entered hibernation late in November, and none retained it upon  emergence from hibernation. Activities in the first few days or weeks  of life influence the length of time that the caruncle is retained;  turtles that begin feeding soon after hatching probably lose the  caruncle more quickly than do those that remain quiescent. The  caruncles of some laboratory specimens became worn before finally  dropping off. Almost every caruncle present after 50 days could be  flicked off easily with a probe or fingernail. The initiation of  growth of the horny maxillary beak probably causes some loosening of  the caruncle. The caruncle may aid hatchlings in escaping from the  nest.    After the caruncle falls off, a distinct boss remains, marking its  former place on the horny beak (Pl. 25, Fig. 1); this boss is  gradually obliterated over a period of weeks by wear and by  differential growth, and is seldom visible in turtles that have begun  their first full year of growth. The \"first full year of growth\" is  here considered to be the period of growth beginning in the spring  after hatching.    Growth of Epidermal Laminae    Growth of ornate box turtles was studied by measuring recaptured  turtles in the field, by periodically measuring captive hatchlings and  juveniles, and by measuring growth-rings on the epidermal laminae of  preserved specimens. Studies of growth-rings provided by far the  greatest volume of information on growth, not only for the years in  which field work was done, but for the entire life of each specimen  examined.    It was necessary to determine the physical nature of growth-rings and  the manner in which they were formed before growth could be analyzed.  Examination of epidermal laminae on the shell of a box turtle reveals  that each has a series of grooves--growth-rings--on its surface. The  deeper grooves are major growth-rings; they occur at varying distances  from one another and run parallel to the growing borders of the  lamina. Major growth-rings vary in number from one to 14 or more,  depending on the age of the turtle (Pl. 22). In juvenal turtles and in  young adults, major growth-rings are distinct and deep. Other grooves  on the shell--minor growth-rings--have the same relationship to the  borders of the laminae but are shallower and less distinct than major  growth-rings. One to several minor growth-rings usually occur on each  smooth area of epidermis between major growth-rings. As the shell of  an adult turtle becomes worn, the minor growth-rings disappear and the  major rings become less distinct. Both sets of rings may be completely  obliterated in old turtles but the major rings usually remain visible  until several years after puberty.    In cross section, major growth-rings are V- or U-shaped. The inner  wall of each groove is the peripheral edge of the part of the scute  last formed whereas the outer wall represents the inner edge of the  next new area of epidermal growth. The gap produced on the surface of  the lamina (the open part of the groove) results from cessation of  growth at the onset of hibernation. Minor growth-rings are shallow  and barely discernible in cross-section (Fig. 8). It may therefore be  understood that growth-rings are compound in origin; each ring is  formed in part at the beginning of hibernation and in part at the  beginning of the following growing season.    The few publications discussing growth in turtles express conflicting  views as to the exact mode of growth of epidermal laminae. Carr  (1952:22) briefly discussed growth of turtle scutes in general and  stated that eccentric growth results from an entirely new laminal  layer forming beneath, and projecting past the edges of the existing  lamina. Ewing (1939) found the scutes of _T. carolina_ to be the  thickest at the areola and successively thinner in the following eight  annual zones of growth; parts of scutes formed subsequent to the ninth  year varied irregularly in thickness. He stated that epidermal growth  took place at the margins of the laminae rather than over their entire  under-surfaces.    It is evident that the mode of scutular growth described by Carr  (_loc. cit._) applies to emyid turtles that shed the epidermal laminae  more or less regularly (for example, _Chrysemys_ and _Pseudemys_). In  these aquatic emyids a layer of the scute, the older portion,  periodically becomes loose and exfoliates usually in one thin,  micalike piece; since the loosened portion of the scute corresponds in  size to the scute below, it must be concluded that a layer of  epidermis is shed from the entire upper surface of the scute,  including the area of new epidermal growth. Box turtles ordinarily do  not shed the older parts of their scutes; the areola and successively  younger portions of the lamina remain attached to the shell until worn  off. The appearance of a single unworn scute, especially one of the  centrals or the posterior laterals, closely resembles a low, lopsided  pyramid.    Examination of parasagittal sections of scutes revealed that they were  composed of layers, the number of layers varying with the age of the  scute. A scute from a hatchling consists of one layer. A scute that  shows a single season of growth has two layers; a new layer is added  in each subsequent season of growth. Stratification is most evident in  the part of the scute that was formed in the first three or four  seasons and becomes increasingly less distinct in newer parts of the  scute. It may further be understood that scutes grow in the manner  described by Carr (_loc. cit._).    When the epidermal laminae are removed, a sheet of tough, pale grayish  tissue remains firmly attached to the bones of the shell beneath. This  layer probably includes, or consists of, germinal epithelium.  Contrasting pale and dark areas of the germinal layer correspond to  the pattern of markings on the scute removed.       [Illustration: FIG. 8. The second central scute from a juvenal         _T. o. ornata_ (KU 16133) in its third full season of growth.         A) Entire scute from above (A-- 2A1/2); dashed line shows portion         removed in parasagittal section. B) Diagonal view of section         removed from scute in \"A\" (A-- 4-3/8, thickness greatly         exaggerated) showing layers of epidermis formed in successive         seasons of growth. Each layer ends at a major growth-ring         (M 1-3) that was formed during hibernation; minor growth-rings         (m), formed in the course of the growing season, do not result         from the formation of a new layer of epidermis. Note the         granular texture of the areola (a); the smooth zone between the         areola and M1 shows amount of growth in the season of         hatching.]      Growth of epidermal laminae is presumably stimulated by growth of the  bony shell. As the bone grows, the germinal layer of the epidermis  grows with it. When growth ceases at the beginning of hibernation, the  thin edges of the scutes are slightly down-turned where they enter the  interlaminal seams (Fig. 8). When growth is resumed in spring, the  germinal layer of the epidermis, rather than continuing to add to the  edge of the existing scute, forms an entirely new layer of epidermis.  The new layer is thin and indistinct under the oldest part of the  scute but becomes more distinct toward its periphery. Immediately  proximal to the edge of the scute, the new layer becomes greatly  thickened, and, where it passes under the edge, it bulges upward,  recurving the free edge of the scute above. At this time the formation  of a major growth-ring is completed. The newly-formed epidermis,  projecting from under the edges of the scute, is paler and softer than  the older parts of the scute; the presence or absence of areas of  newly formed epidermis enables one to determine quickly whether a  turtle is growing in the season in which it is captured. There is  little actual increase in thickness of the scute after the first three  or four years of growth. The epidermal laminae are therefore like low  pyramids only in appearance. This appearance of thickness is enhanced  by the contours of bony shell which correspond to the contours of the  scutes.    Minor growth-rings differ from major growth-rings in appearance and in  origin. Ewing (_op. cit._: 91) recognized the difference in appearance  and referred to minor growth-rings as \"pseudoannual growth zones.\"  Minor growth-rings result from temporary cessations of growth that  occur in the course of the growing season, not at the onset of  hibernation. They are mere dips or depressions in the surface of the  scute. The occurrence of minor growth-rings indicates that  interruptions in growth of short duration do not result in the  formation of a new layer of epidermis. Slowing of growth or its  temporary cessation may be caused by injuries, periods of quiescence  due to dry, hot, or cold weather, lack of food, and possibly by  physiological stress, especially in females, in the season of  reproduction. Minor growth-rings that lie immediately proximal to  major growth-rings (Pl. 22, Fig. 2), are the result of temporary  dormancy in a period of cold weather at the end of a growing season,  followed by nearly normal activity in a warmer period before  winter-long hibernation is begun. Cagle (1946:699) stated that sliders  (_Pseudemys scripta elegans_) remaining several weeks in a pond that  had become barren of food would stop growing and develop a growth-ring  on the epidermal laminae; he did not indicate, however, whether these  growth-rings differ from those formed during hibernation.    In species that periodically shed scutes a zone of fracture develops  between the old and new layers of the scute as each new layer of  epidermis is formed, and the old layer is shed.

David Mech and L. D. Frenzel, Jr.      The selective effect of predation on prey populations is of  significance in studies of evolution and population dynamics. Selective  predation can be an important agent in the process of natural  selection, and it influences the extent to which predators limit the  numbers of their prey.    One of the predators most commonly chosen for investigating the  selective effect upon prey is the wolf (_Canis lupus_). Because animals  preyed upon by wolves generally are large, their remains can be more  easily located and examined. It already has been established that in  most areas wolves kill primarily young, old, and other inferior members  of such prey populations as Dall sheep (_Ovis dalli_), moose (_Alces  alces_), caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_), bison (_Bison bison_), and  musk-oxen (_Ovibos moschatus_); evidence for this generalization has  been summarized by Mech (1970).    However, only recently has it been shown that this generalization may  extend to predation on the smallest hoofed prey of the wolf in North  America, the white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_). Pimlott _et  al._ (1969) demonstrated a difference between the age structure of 331  deer killed by wolves during winter in Algonquin Park, Ontario, and 275  deer assumed to represent the actual population in the same area.  Whereas only 13 percent of the deer from the population at large were  estimated to be more than 5 years old, 58 percent of the wolf-kills  were in this age category.    We employed a similar analysis for deer killed by wolves in  northeastern Minnesota, but used a more refined aging technique and  included comparisons of the age and sex structures of various  subsamples of wolf-kills. Whereas the Ontario research involved a prey  population unlimited by man, our work was carried out on both a hunted  population and on one relatively unhunted. Further comparisons were  made between deer killed during periods of normal snow conditions and  those taken during unusually high snow accumulations. The incidence of  various abnormalities in wolf-killed deer was also compared with that  in hunter-killed animals.    The study was carried out in the Superior National Forest in northern  St. Louis, Lake, and Cook Counties of northeastern Minnesota (fig. 1),  in conjunction with other aspects of wolf research (see Mech _et al._  p. 1).    [Illustration: _Figure 1.--The study area showing locations where  wolf-killed and hunter-killed deer were taken. Line arbitrarily  separates the hunted area from the wilderness area._]      METHODS    The investigation began in February 1966 and continued through March  1969; the basic objective was to examine as many wolf-killed deer as  possible and compare their ages, sex, and condition with a large sample  of deer from the population at large in the same area. Wolf-kills were  examined only during December through March when they could be found  from the air. Aircraft ranging in size from an Aeronca Champ to a  Cessna 206 were used to fly over frozen lakes at altitudes up to 2,000  feet to locate wolves (fig. 2), wolf tracks, or kills (fig. 3). We  often discovered kills by tracking a wolf pack.    [Illustration: _Figure 2.--Wolves were located from the air, usually on  frozen lakes. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    [Illustration: _Figure 3.--Wolf-kills were easily spotted from  aircraft. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    During the winter of 1968-69 this method of finding kills was  supplemented by radiotracking five wolves and their associates via  aircraft (see Mech _et al._, p. 1). The latter technique resulted in  increased discovery of inland kills.    A deer carcass was judged killed by wolves if the death had been  recent, if tracks or other sign indicated that wolves had fed upon it,  and if no other possible cause of death was discovered. Carcasses fed  on by wolves but not clearly identifiable as kills were labeled  \"probable\" wolf-kills. Although the cause of death of the specimens in  this latter category could not be determined with certainty, there was  no reason to believe other agents were involved.    In addition to the wolf-kills examined by project personnel, data and  lower jaws from deer judged killed by wolves were contributed by other  biologists, game wardens, forest rangers, and others whose competence  was known. Nevertheless, if certain identification of carcasses as  wolf-kills was not possible, the data were relegated to the \"probable\"  wolf-kill category.    Whenever possible, kills discovered from the air were examined on the  ground (fig. 4). Often only skeletal parts remained, but soft parts  were also examined when available. Femur marrow, heart, lungs, liver,  kidneys, reproductive tracts, and omenta were usually inspected in the  field for fat, parasites, and abnormalities, and the degree of  subcutaneous back fat was also noted. Hoofs and lower legs were  checked, and those showing pathological conditions or abnormalities  were collected and examined by the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of  the University of Minnesota. All lower jaws found were collected, aged,  and examined for dental abnormalities and pathological conditions.    [Illustration: _Figure 4.--As many wolf-killed deer as possible were  examined from the ground. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    In November 1967 and 1968 hunter-check stations were operated on the  study area (fig. 5), and deer bagged by hunters were field-checked for  age (Severinghaus 1949) and hoof abnormalities. As many lower jaws as  possible were collected from field-checked deer and other deer killed  in the area for age determination and examination for abnormal  dentition.    [Illustration: _Figure 5.--Information about hunter-killed deer in the  study area was obtained through hunter-check stations. (Photo courtesy  of L. D. Frenzel.)_]    An assumption was made that the age structure and incidence of  abnormalities in the sample of hunter-killed deer would be _reasonably  representative_ of those in the population at large, an assumption also  implicit in a similar comparison made by Pimlott _et al._ (1969). In  this respect, the following statements by Maguire and Severinghaus  (1954, p. 109) about deer in New York State are pertinent: \"It may be  concluded that, considering the open season as a whole,"]]]
