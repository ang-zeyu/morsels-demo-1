[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47449"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 8 (of 8) (#11)"],[1,"Taal, based on the seventeenth-century Hollander Dutch, with  a mixture of many strange words, Kaffir and English, and with the  omission of most grammatical inflexions. In that happy tongue you are  permitted to say: 'I is.' It is needless to say there is no literature  in this patois, as there is in the Hollander Dutch of this century. Now,  it is only to Hollander Dutch that it is proposed to accord equal  audience as an official language. The official recognition of Hollander  Dutch dates from 1882 in the Cape Colony, and is a result of the  political propaganda of the Afrikander Bond. It was openly announced and  hailed as the 'thin end of the wedge' to prevent the fusion of the Boer  and British strains of the European people, and to drive the British  into the sea. It is almost as grotesque a misrepresentation to call this  claim for the official recognition of Hollander Dutch a popular demand,  as if, in regard to modern Italy, we were told that the peasants of  Umbria or the Marches were hungering and thirsting for the recognition  of Augustan Latin as entitled to equal audience with Italian in the  courts and public offices of Italy.    \"The veld Boer does not understand Hollander Dutch. He only hears the  Hollander tongue, or, rather, the seventeenth-century predecessor of it,  in the text from the seventeenth-century Dutch Bible read out in the  churches on Sundays by the predikant, or in the hymns, once chanted by  his forefathers of the Lowlands, who worsted Alva, persecutor of the  Saints of the Lord.    \"It will clear the air greatly if people at home will realise what is  the force behind this Hollander Dutch language movement. It is the Young  Afrikander party.    \"For sixty years English was the sole official language in South Africa.  The experiment of two official languages is one of only twenty years'  duration, and has not been crowned with any conspicuous success, unless  racial cleavage, political and social, be counted as such.    \"No other course can so speedily promote the fusion of all Europeans.  Judging by the trend of events, the future among the European people  belongs to one or two of the great languages. It is significant that, at  the present moment of time, with a knowledge of English and French, one  can travel the world. The fusion of European strains, so happily  accomplished in the United States of America, is admittedly due to the  determined enforcement of a single language as the sole official  language of the Republic. Immigrants of all European nationalities learn  to speak and write English--their children of the next generation become  Americans. As a London Consul-General of the United States pointed out  to me, the reunion of the European race, as a political measure on a  vast scale, has been first accomplished in the American Commonwealth.  Never since the pre-historic time of the root-origins of our language,  never since the corporate unity of the Roman Empire, has there been so  vast a breaking down of barriers between Europeans.    \"The matter is one of political expediency, not of æsthetics. The unity  of the European people is a greater historic fact and present reality  than any of those brief heritages of common life for a few short  centuries of one or other sections of the race, giving rise to the  national tongues. Personally, one may sympathise with the scholar's  preference for a survival of Latin as the language of Europe, as it was  during the Roman Empire, as it was during the Middle Ages, and as it  would have remained but for the outburst of Nationalist particularism  during the sixteenth century. One may lament, with a loyal European like  Talleyrand, what that outburst has cost Europe; led by the ambition of  the House of Capet in France, of the Tudor in England, and the princes  of North Germany, plunderers of the Teutonic knights. No doubt it is  true that thousands of millions of pounds and millions of lives have  been wasted by that particularism--strange step-child of the unifying  Renaissance. From the æsthetic side, it is vain to argue whether Keltic  be a purer tongue, more passionately expressive, Spanish more majestic,  or Italian liquid music. The sieve of the gods seems hitherto to let  through, for the world of the European race, only two of the great  tongues--French and English.\"    In a word, for all æsthetic purposes, let the various harmonies of all  the tongues of the European race continue to enrich the choir,  enshrining memories of the past. But for the political field of action  the trumpet of command and order should sound a note clear from its  being single.    Any incidental inconvenience, such as must arise to the first generation  of immigrants to the American Commonwealth, must only be treated as  transitory, and, as far as possible, provided against. Very few  Europeans who do not know English have business in the law-courts or  public offices. In the years preceding the late war, only five out of  every hundred cases in the Transvaal law-courts were between people not  conversant with English. For this small minority, in all the public  offices and the courts, competent interpreters can be provided.      VII.--LEGISLATIVE MEASURES    It may be well that I should add some suggestions as to the measures  which I at present hold should be taken to put into force the general  lines of legislation, already sketched out as suitable for the carrying  out of the Imperial policy as already defined. But it should be  understood that these suggestions are only intended as furnishing  material for discussion. In the absence of fuller information as to  future needs and emergencies, it would be unwise to finally advocate  concrete measures. What is, in my mind, of importance is not any  specific measure, but the principles of Imperial policy on which I have  insisted. If it can be shown to me, in the future discussions on these  matters, in which I hope to take part on my return to South Africa, that  other measures are better suited to carry out the consistent policy I  have defined, I shall be prepared to advocate such other measures.    In the first place, I think that in view of the wide divergence of  opinion and interest, among the British residents quite as much as among  the Boers, a consultative body, nominated by the High Commissioner,  should be appointed to advise on any projected legislation. For some  time, while the form of Crown Colony Government is continued, advice  from such a body will be specially needful. Apart from the maintenance  of law and order, the interests of the great mining groups,  representation of shareholders resident in Europe is by no means  necessarily the same as those of the rest of the British residents, or  indeed those of the Imperial Government. Among such matters of  divergence of interest may be enumerated the scale and method of  taxation on the mines, no matter for what Imperial purpose--British  immigration, State irrigation works, or university and general  education. The maintenance of the present very high rate of wages of the  European miners is another subject. British residents in the towns,  shopkeepers, importers, professional men and their employees, are  concerned in the maintenance of a high rate of wages for the miners, as  the money is spent in the country, not in Paris or Berlin. Again, the  introduction of the truck system, the supply of goods by the miners to  their employees, European or Kaffir, while it would increase the profits  of mining shareholders in Europe, would destroy the means of existence  of the bulk of the British residents in the towns.    Amongst the Boers, there is almost as great divergence of interest  between the wealthy farmers, desirous of keeping together their vast  cattle ranches of 6000 acres, and the class of Bijwoners (tenants at  will on an over-lord's land), whose interest would be favoured by the  dividing up of cattle ranches, and the encouragement of small farmers  who would be agriculturists.    For this reason, a consultation body should be thoroughly representative  of all classes.    Direct legislation favouring British immigration of agriculturists is  plainly necessary, and as well the creation of State irrigation works.  Such steps, it is reassuring to know, have already been taken.  Personally, I am in favour of village ownership of agricultural lands  being instituted, a system with which the Boers are already familiar, in  connection with the cultivation of the lands owned by the towns.    To promote the prosperity of British residents in the towns, and as well  to secure a market for agricultural produce, the truck system should be  prohibited by law; and the compound system, under which the Kaffir  workmen in mines are not only supplied with goods but confined to  barracks called \"compounds,\" should also be prohibited. Neither system  has hitherto been in force in the new Colonies.    As regards the Gold Law, the new British administration has established  a tax of ten per cent. on the net profits of each mine, and has retained  the previous system as well, of taxing the possession of mining areas.  It will require some time to see how the present method of levy affects  the growth of the British population. Personally, I have not been  convinced by the arguments in favour of the \"claim license\" system: it  is held by its opponents that it tends to throw all the mining areas  into the possession of the great mining groups, the areas being  forfeited to the State in times of depression by poorer men who are  unable to continue to pay. Suggestions deserving consideration have been  made as to the advisability of the State developing gold areas already  in the possession of the State.    As regards the arrears of claim licenses accruing during the war against  the expelled British inhabitants, I have strongly advocated in the  London press their entire remission. The Boer burgher on commando is  held to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#11)"],[1," be beautiful. The son, an ogreish  pattern of his father, had stood with his back to the Madonna, whose  overfat arms had seemed to rest on his shoulders. He remembered that.    The girl was watching him closely when he turned toward her. He had  frankly looked the room over, without concealing his intention. She was  breathing a little unsteadily, and her hair was shimmering gloriously  in the light of an overhead chandelier. She sat down with that light  over her, motioning him to be seated opposite her--across the same  table from which he had snatched the copper weight that had killed  Kirkstone. He had never seen anything quite so steady, quite so  beautiful as her eyes when they looked across at him. He thought of  McDowell's suspicion and of Shan Tung and gripped himself hard. The  same strange perfume hung subtly on the air he was breathing. On a  small silver tray at his elbow lay the ends of three freshly burned  cigarettes.    \"Of course you remember this room?\"    He nodded. \"Yes. It was night when I came, like this. The next day I  went after John Keith.\"    She leaned toward him, her hands clasped in front of her on the table.  \"You will tell me the truth about John Keith?\" she asked in a low,  tense voice. \"You swear that it will be the truth?\"    \"I will keep nothing back from you that I have told Inspector  McDowell,\" he answered, fighting to meet her eyes steadily. \"I almost  believe I may tell you more.\"    \"Then--did you speak the truth when you reported to Inspector McDowell?  IS JOHN KEITH DEAD?\" Could Shan Tung meet those wonderful eyes as he  was meeting them now, he wondered? Could he face them and master them,  as McDowell had hinted? To McDowell the lie had come easily to his  tongue. It stuck in his throat now. Without giving him time to prepare  himself the girl had shot straight for the bull's-eye, straight to the  heart of the thing that meant life or death to him, and for a moment he  found no answer. Clearly he was facing suspicion. She could not have  driven the shaft intuitively. The unexpectedness of the thing  astonished him and then thrilled him, and in the thrill of it he found  himself more than ever master of himself.    \"Would you like to hear how utterly John Keith is dead and how he  died?\" he asked.    \"Yes. That is what I must know.\"    He noticed that her hands had closed. Her slender fingers were clenched  tight.    \"I hesitate, because I have almost promised to tell you even more than  I told McDowell,\" he went on. \"And that will not be pleasant for you to  hear. He killed your father. There can be no sympathy in your heart for  John Keith. It will not be pleasant for you to hear that I liked the  man, and that I am sorry he is dead.\"    \"Go on--please.\"    Her hands unclasped. Her fingers lay limp. Something faded slowly out  of her face. It was as if she had hoped for something, and that hope  was dying. Could it be possible that she had hoped he would say that  John Keith was alive?    \"Did you know this man?\" he asked.    \"This John Keith?\"    She shook her head. \"No. I was away at school for many years. I don't  remember him.\"    \"But he knew you--that is, he had seen you,\" said Keith. \"He used to  talk to me about you in those days when he was helpless and dying. He  said that he was sorry for you, and that only because of you did he  ever regret the justice he brought upon your father. You see I speak  his words. He called it justice. He never weakened on that point. You  have probably never heard his part of the story.\"    \"No.\"    The one word forced itself from her lips. She was expecting him to go  on, and waited, her eyes never for an instant leaving his face.    He did not repeat the story exactly as he had told it to McDowell. The  facts were the same, but the living fire of his own sympathy and his  own conviction were in them now. He told it purely from Keith's point  of view, and Miriam Kirkstone's face grew whiter, and her hands grew  tense again, as she listened for the first time to Keith's own version  of the tragedy of the room in which they were sitting. And then he  followed Keith up into that land of ice and snow and gibbering Eskimos,  and from that moment he was no longer Keith but spoke with the lips of  Conniston. He described the sunless weeks and months of madness until  the girl's eyes seemed to catch fire, and when at last he came to the  little cabin in which Conniston had died, he was again John Keith. He  could not have talked about himself as he did about the Englishman. And  when he came to the point where he buried Conniston under the floor, a  dry, broken sob broke in upon him from across the table. But there were  no tears in the girl's eyes. Tears, perhaps, would have hidden from him  the desolation he saw there. But she did not give in. Her white throat  twitched. She tried to draw her breath steadily. And then she said:    \"And that--was John Keith!\"    He bowed his head in confirmation of the lie, and, thinking of  Conniston, he said:    \"He was the finest gentleman I ever knew. And I am sorry he is dead.\"    \"And I, too, am sorry.\"    She was reaching a hand across the table to him, slowly, hesitatingly.  He stared at her.    \"You mean that?\"    \"Yes, I am sorry.\"    He took her hand. For a moment her fingers tightened about his own.  Then they relaxed and drew gently away from him. In that moment he saw  a sudden change come into her face. She was looking beyond him, over  his right shoulder. Her eyes widened, her pupils dilated under his  gaze, and she held her breath. With the swift caution of the man-hunted  he turned. The room was empty behind him. There was nothing but a  window at his back. The rain was drizzling against it, and he noticed  that the curtain was not drawn, as they were drawn at the other  windows. Even as he looked, the girl went to it and pulled down the  shade. He knew that she had seen something, something that had startled  her for a moment, but he did not question her. Instead, as if he had  noticed nothing, he asked if he might light a cigar.    \"I see someone smokes,\" he excused himself, nodding at the cigarette  butts.    He was watching her closely and would have recalled the words in the  next breath. He had caught her. Her brother was out of town. And there  was a distinctly unAmerican perfume in the smoke that someone had left  in the room. He saw the bit of red creeping up her throat into her  cheeks, and his conscience shamed him. It was difficult for him not to  believe McDowell now. Shan Tung had been there. It was Shan Tung who  had left the hall as he entered. Probably it was Shan Tung whose face  she had seen at the window.    What she said amazed him. \"Yes, it is a shocking habit of mine, Mr.  Conniston. I learned to smoke in the East. Is it so very bad, do you  think?\"    He fairly shook himself. He wanted to say, \"You beautiful little liar,  I'd like to call your bluff right now, but I won't, because I'm sorry  for you!\" Instead, he nipped off the end of his cigar, and said:    \"In England, you know, the ladies smoke a great deal. Personally I may  be a little prejudiced. I don't know that it is sinful, especially when  one uses such good judgment--in orientals.\" And then he was powerless  to hold himself back. He smiled at her frankly, unafraid. \"I don't  believe you smoke,\" he added.    He rose to his feet, still smiling across at her, like a big brother  waiting for her confidence. She was not alarmed at the directness with  which he had guessed the truth. She was no longer embarrassed. She  seemed for a moment to be looking through him and into him, a strange  and yearning desire glowing dully in her eyes. He saw her throat  twitching again, and he was filled with an infinite compassion for this  daughter of the man he had killed. But he kept it within himself. He  had gone far enough. It was for her to speak. At the door she gave him  her hand again, bidding him good-night. She looked pathetically  helpless, and he thought that someone ought to be there with the right  to take her in his arms and comfort her.    \"You will come again?\" she whispered.    \"Yes, I am coming again,\" he said. \"Good-night.\"    He passed out into the drizzle. The door closed behind him, but not  before there came to him once more that choking sob from the throat of  Miriam Kirkstone.          IX      Keith's hand was on the butt of his revolver as he made his way through  the black night. He could not see the gravel path under his feet but  could only feel it. Something that was more than a guess made him feel  that Shan Tung was not far away, and he wondered if it was a  premonition, and what it meant. With the keen instinct of a hound he  was scenting for a personal danger. He passed through the gate and  began the downward slope toward town, and not until then did he begin  adding things together and analyzing the situation as it had  transformed itself since he had stood in the door of the Shack,  welcoming the storm from the western mountains. He thought that he had  definitely made up his mind then; now it was chaotic. He could not  leave Prince Albert immediately, as the inspiration had moved him a few  hours before. McDowell had practically given him an assignment. And  Miss Kirkstone was holding him. Also Shan Tung. He felt within himself  the sensation of one who was traveling on very thin ice, yet he could  not tell just where or why it was thin.    \"Just a fool hunch,\" he assured himself.    \"Why the deuce should I let a confounded Chinaman and a pretty girl get  on my nerves at this stage of the game? If it wasn't for McDowell--\"    And there he stopped. He had fought too long at the raw edge of things  to allow himself to be persuaded by delusions, and he confessed that it  was John Keith who was holding him, that in some inexplicable way John  Keith, though officially dead and buried, was mixed up in a mysterious  affair in which Miriam Kirkstone and Shan Tung were the"]]]
