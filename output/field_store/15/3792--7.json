It was this  talent which induced Michelangiolo to present him to Julius III. by whom he  was pensioned as one of the Palatine painters of his time.    He had a daughter and a pupil in Lavinia Fontana, named also Zappi, from  the family of Imola, into which she was married. This lady executed several  altar-pieces at Rome and at Bologna in the paternal style, as far as  regards colouring; but less successful in point of design and composition.  She felt the inferiority, as is observed by Baglione, and sought reputation  from portrait-painting, a branch in which she is preferred by some to  Prospero. It is certain that she wrought with a sort of feminine  perseverance, in order that her portraits should more faithfully express  every line and feature of nature in the countenances, every refinement of  art in the drapery. She became painter to Pope Gregory XIII., and was more  particularly applied to by the Roman ladies, whose ornaments she displayed  more perfectly than any male artist in the world. She attained to so high a  degree of sweetness and softness in the art, especially after knowing the  works of the Caracci, that one or two of her portraits have been attributed  to Guido. With equal ability she produced a number of cabinet pictures,  such as that Holy Family for the Escurial, so much commended by Mazzolari,  and her Sheba at the throne of Solomon, which I saw in the collection of  the late Marchese Giacomo Zambeccari. She has there expressed, in the form  of allegory, the Duke and Duchess of Mantua, surrounded by many lords and  ladies of their court, arrayed in splendid style; a painting that would  reflect credit on the Venetian School. Gifted with such genius, she was by  no means chary of her own likenesses executed by herself, which ornament  the royal gallery of Florence and other collections. But there remains no  specimen more truly speaking and delightful than the one belonging to the  Conti Zappi, at Imola, where it is accompanied by the portrait of Prospero  in his declining days, also painted by her.    Lorenzo Sabbatini, called likewise Lorenzin di Bologna, was one of the most  graceful and delicate painters of his age. I have heard him enumerated  among the pupils of Raffaello by keepers of the galleries, deceived  doubtless by his Holy Families, designed and composed in the best Roman  taste, although invariably more feebly coloured. I have also seen some of  his Holy Virgins and Angels painted for private ornament, which resemble  Parmigianino. Nor were his altar-pieces inferior; the most celebrated of  which is that of St. Michael, engraved by Agostino Caracci, from an altar  of S. Giacomo Maggiore; and this he held up as an example of gracefulness  and beauty, to his whole school. He was, moreover, a fine fresco painter,  correct in design, of copious invention, universal master in the subjects  of the piece, and what is still more remarkable, most rapid in point of  execution. Endowed with such qualities, he was engaged by many noble houses  in his native place; but on proceeding to Rome in the pontificate of  Gregory XIII., according to Baglione, he there met with success; insomuch,  that even his fleshes and naked figures were highly commended, though this  was by no means a branch of his pursuits at Bologna. In the Capella  Paolina, he represented the histories of St. Paul; in the royal hall, the  picture of Faith, shewn in triumph over Infidelity; in the gallery and the  lodges a variety of other pieces, always in competition with the best  masters, and always with equal applause. Hence, in the immense list of  artificers at that period congregated at Rome, he was selected to preside  over the labours of the Vatican, in the enjoyment of which honourable post  he died at an early age in 1577.    It is difficult to believe, as asserted by some writers, that Giulio  Bonasone was his pupil, an artist who practised engraving in copper as  early as 1544. On reaching a more mature age, he seems to have devoted  himself to painting, leaving several paintings on canvass, but feeble and  varying in their style. At S. Stefano there is one of Purgatory, in the  style of Sabbatini, extremely fine, and composed, as it is conjectured,  with the assistance of Lorenzino. The productions, also, of Cesare Aretusi,  of Felice Pasqualini, and of Giulio Morina, are in existence, though the  name of Sabbatini might perhaps be justly substituted for theirs; such was  the part he took in their labours. The latter, with Girolamo Mattioli,  after the celebrity gained by the Caracci, became their eager followers.  The labours of Mattioli, who died young, were distributed among different  private houses, particularly in that of the noble family of Zani: those of  Morina are seen in various churches at Bologna, and for the most part  betray a degree of affectation of the style of Parma, at which city he some  time painted in the service of the duke.    Orazio Samacchini, the intimate friend of Sabbatini, his contemporary, and  who followed him at a short interval to the tomb, began his career by  imitating Pellegrino and the Lombards. Proceeding next to Rome, and  employed in painting for the royal hall, under Pius IV.; he succeeded in  catching the taste of the Roman School, for which he was praised by Vasari,  (who calls him Fumaccini) and afterwards by Borghini and Lomazzo. In the  display of this his new style, however, he contrived to please others more  than himself; and returning to Bologna, he was accustomed to lament that he  had ever removed from upper Italy, where he might have carried his early  manner to greater perfection, without deviating in search of a new. Still  he had no reason to feel dissatisfied with that which he had thus formed of  various others, and so moulded by his own genius, as to exhibit something  singular in its every character. In his altar-piece of the Purification, at  S. Jacopo, it is all exquisite delicacy, in which the leading figures  enchant us with at once a majestic and tender expression of piety; while  those infant figures seen conversing near the altar, and that of the young  girl holding a little basket with two doves, gazing on them in so peculiar  a manner, delight us with their mingled simplicity and grace. Skilful  judges even can take no exceptions but to the display of too great  diligence, with which, during several years, he had studied and polished  this single painting. This, however, as one of the most celebrated of its  school, was engraved by Agostino, and it would seem that even Guido availed  himself of it in his Presentation, painted for the cathedral of Modena, yet  he was an equally powerful artist where his subjects required it of him.  His chapel, of which we gave an account in the Parmese School, is highly  commended, though his most vigorous effort is shewn in the ceiling of S.  Abbondio, at Cremona. The grand and the terrible seem to strive for mastery  in the figures of the prophets, in all their actions and positions; the  most difficult from confinement of space, yet the best arranged and  imagined. There is, moreover, a truth in the shortenings, and a skilful use  of the _sotto in su_,[12] which appears in this instance to have selected  the most difficult portion of the art, in order to triumph over it. His  forte is believed to have consisted in grand undertakings in fresco, on  which he impressed, as it were, the seal of a vast spirit, at once resolute  and earnest, without altering it by corrections and retouches, with which  he laboured his paintings in oil, as we have stated.         Footnote 12: Foreshortening figures; here meant on a ceiling.    Bartolommeo Passerotti has been commended by Borghini and Lomazzo; and he  is casually named also by Vasari among the assistants of Taddeo Zuccaro;  indeed, it may rather be said, this is the artist with whom Vasari ceases  to write, and Malvasia to inveigh.[13] He possessed excellent skill in  designing with his pen; a gift which drew to his school Agostino Caracci,  and which assisted the latter as a guide in the art of engraving. He  likewise wrote a book, from which he taught the symmetry and anatomy of the  human body, essential to the artist; and was the first who, to make a  grander display, began to vary scriptural histories at Bologna by drawing  the naked torsi. The finest of these specimens are, the Beheading of St.  Paul, at Rome, in the Tre Fontane; and at S. Giacomo, of Bologna, a picture  of the Virgin among various saints; a work meant to compete with the  Caracci, and embellished by their praise. One of his pictures too of  \"Tizio\" was much celebrated, which, being exhibited to the public, was  supposed by the professors of Bologna to have been the work of  Michelangiolo. This exquisite degree of diligence and refinement he rarely  used; most generally he was bold and free, somewhat resembling Cesare, only  more correct. In his portraits, however, he is by no means a common  painter. After Titian, Guido included him among the very first, not  preferring before him the Caracci themselves, whose name, indeed, in  several galleries, is attached to the portraits of Passerotti. The most  commendable of all however, are those he executed for the noble family  Legnani--entire figures extremely varied in costume, in action, and  attitudes; it being his usual custom to compose portraits, such as Ridolfi  described of Paris, which should appear ideal pictures. By means of such a  talent, which made him agreeable to the great, by his polite and refined  manners and malicious strictures, he became a match for the Caracci; for  whom he also prepared rivals in a number of his sons, whom he carefully  instructed in the art. Among these, Tiburzio possessed real merit, of which  his fine picture of the Martyrdom of St. Catherine, conducted in the taste  of his father, displays sufficient proof.

[MUTE MAKES A LEG.]     --Enough. Now, Cutbeard, with the same discipline I use to my     family, I will question you. As I conceive, Cutbeard, this     gentlewoman is she you have provided, and brought, in hope she     will fit me in the place and person of a wife? Answer me not, but     with your leg, unless it be otherwise:     [CUT. MAKES A LEG.]     --Very well done, Cutbeard. I conceive, besides, Cutbeard, you     have been pre-acquainted with her birth, education, and qualities,     or else you would not prefer her to my acceptance, in the weighty     consequence of marriage.     [CUT. MAKES A LEG.]     --This I conceive, Cutbeard. Answer me not but with your leg, unless     it be otherwise.     [CUT. BOWS AGAIN.]     --Very well done, Cutbeard. Give aside now a little, and leave me to     examine her condition, and aptitude to my affection.     [HE GOES ABOUT HER, AND VIEWS HER.]     --She is exceeding fair, and of a special good favour; a sweet     composition or harmony of limbs: her temper of beauty has the     true height of my blood. The knave hath exceedingly well fitted me     without: I will now try her within. Come near, fair gentlewoman:     let not my behaviour seem rude, though unto you, being rare, it     may haply appear strange.     [EPICOENE CURTSIES.]     --Nay, lady, you may speak, though Cutbeard and my man, might not;     for, of all sounds, only the sweet voice of a fair lady has the     just length of mine ears. I beseech you, say, lady; out of the     first fire of meeting eyes, they say, love is stricken: do you     feel any such motion suddenly shot into you, from any part you see     in me? ha, lady?     [EPICOENE CURTSIES.]     --Alas, lady, these answers by silent curtsies from you are too     courtless and simple. I have ever had my breeding in court: and     she that shall be my wife, must be accomplished with courtly and     audacious ornaments. Can you speak, lady?       EPI: [softly.] Judge you, forsooth.       MOR: What say you, lady? speak out, I beseech you.       EPI: Judge you, forsooth.       MOR: On my judgment, a divine softness! But can you naturally,     lady, as I enjoin these by doctrine and industry, refer yourself     to the search of my judgment, and, not taking pleasure in your     tongue, which is a woman's chiefest pleasure, think it plausible     to answer me by silent gestures, so long as my speeches jump     right with what you conceive?     [EPI. CURTSIES.]     --Excellent! divine! if it were possible she should hold out thus!     Peace, Cutbeard, thou art made for ever, as thou hast made me, if     this felicity have lasting: but I will try her further. Dear lady,     I am courtly, I tell you, and I must have mine ears banqueted with     pleasant and witty conferences, pretty girls, scoffs, and     dalliance in her that I mean to choose for my bed-phere. The     ladies in court think it a most desperate impair to their     quickness of wit, and good carriage, if they cannot give     occasion for a man to court 'em; and when an amorous discourse is     set on foot, minister as good matter to continue it, as himself:     And do you alone so much differ from all them, that what they,     with so much circumstance, affect and toil for, to seem     learn'd, to seem judicious, to seem sharp and conceited, you     can bury in yourself with silence, and rather trust your graces     to the fair conscience of virtue, than to the world's or your own     proclamation?       EPI [SOFTLY]: I should be sorry else.       MOR: What say you lady? good lady, speak out.       EPI: I should be sorry else.       MOR: That sorrow doth fill me with gladness. O Morose, thou art     happy above mankind! pray that thou mayest contain thyself. I     will only put her to it once more, and it shall be with the utmost     touch and test of their sex. But hear me, fair lady; I do also     love to see her whom I shall choose for my heifer, to be the     first and principal in all fashions; "]]]
