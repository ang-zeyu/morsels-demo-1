They stopped. Only Marta understood their English words.    \"Poor little thing, she looks ready to cry. Do find out about them,\"  begged one of the ladies of the party.    \"Do you understand English?\" her husband asked Guiseppe.    \"Yes, sir,\" Marta answered for her husband.    \"What have you to entertain us?\"    \"We have the Punchinellos, and we have the child, who sings and dances.\"    \"We had enough of the Punchinellos in Naples. Let the little girl give  us a song,\" cried an Englishman, taking a coin from his pocket. Others  did the same. \"A song, a song!\" they cried.    Marta translated to Guiseppe.    \"Pappina, sing,\" he commanded.    \"No.\"    Guiseppe felt an anger he dared not show.    \"Pappina, sing for America,\" he begged.    The obstinate little girl shook her head.    \"I told you, Guiseppe,\" she answered, \"I'll never sing till you give me  those beads.\"    Guiseppe stood for a moment with his hand on the beads, irresolute. He  heard the jingle of coins waiting to be paid for the song.    Pappina was quick to notice that his hand was in his pocket.    \"Guiseppe, won't you give me the beads?\" she pleaded. \"I want them so  much. Please, dear Guiseppe!\"    She stretched out her hand for them just as the gentleman who was  driving took up the lines to continue the drive.    \"Stop, we are ready,\" cried Guiseppe, handing the beads to Pappina. She  fastened the string around her neck, took up her tambourine, and sang.    True little Neapolitan, in her delight over the new necklace she sang  and danced with such spirit that even Guiseppe was surprised. The  tourists, having paid well for Pappina's songs, went on their way.    \"That pretty lady in blue,\" said Marta as the travelers departed, \"was  wondering if we treat you well, Pappina. She said she wished she could  speak Italian and find out if you are our own child, and if you are  happy in your life, or only singing to keep from being beaten, as so  many little singers have to do.\"    Pappina laughed merrily.    \"Why didn't you tell her that I always love you, Marta?\" she cried.  \"And sometimes I love Guiseppe.\"    She went to Guiseppe and reaching up on her tiptoes, patted his cheek.    \"_Caro_ Guiseppe,\" she said, \"I love you to-day because you gave me the  beads. Perhaps to-morrow I shall hate you, and--really, Guiseppe--I  can't help it. Sometimes you're so mean I could kill you, but to-day,  Guiseppe,\" fondling her beads, \"I love you almost as well as I do  Marta.\"    Pappina's words and little caress pleased Guiseppe, but he let neither  her nor Marta see his pleasure. He took up the Punchinellos, merely  saying: \"I guess we'll be moving.\"    It was a happy little group that continued its way toward Salerno.  Pappina took off her beads every few minutes to admire them.    \"How good you are, Guiseppe!\" she repeatedly said to him. Her happiness  brought a smile to Guiseppe's hard face.    Marta likened her to a humming-bird, as she flitted in song from flower  to flower, plucking first one for Marta, then one for Guiseppe.    Pappina was too full of life and joy to-day to plod along with Marta  behind Guiseppe. She kept running ahead of the two. Something unusual  attracted her notice and as she did not have the patience to stand and  wait for them, she ran back to meet them, exclaiming as she seized  their hands:    \"Hurry! There's the cutest little church down the road. Come quickly!  We must all pray.\"    \"It's a wayside shrine,\" Marta told her.    \"Not a church? Then can't we go there and pray?\" Pappina said with a  disappointed look.    \"Yes, dear. Everywhere through this country we find these shrines. They  are built for just such wanderers as we, that we may always remember to  pray.\"    \"There's a light. See, Marta.\"    \"There is always a candle or a little lamp burning at the altar, where  we pray to either a picture or a statuette of the Madonna.\"    By this time they were at the entrance. Pappina turned to Guiseppe and  took his hand.    \"If you hadn't given me the beads,\" she said, \"I shouldn't want to  pray.\"    After their devotions were over the three continued their journey  to Salerno, so prettily situated in a cozy little corner of Salerno  Bay, and backed by gigantic mountains which remind one of a father  protecting his child. They walked into the town, down the narrow,  irregular streets.    As they paused at a corner Pappina struck her tambourine, ready to  start her song.    \"No, no, not yet, little one,\" Guiseppe said. \"This is not the place  for you. You and Marta sit down and wait for me here. I'll look about a  bit and find out what is going on in the town.\"    They watched him as he walked briskly down the street. Once he looked  back and waved his hand to Pappina, who in turn threw him a kiss.    \"I just love Guiseppe when he is good!\" cried the child. \"I hope he  won't be gone long,\" she added, as her eyes followed his retreating  figure.    Stern and forbidding as Guiseppe usually looked, when he wished to  be agreeable he had an air that charmed all whom he met. He had  bright stories at his command and could tell them as became a man of  his former calling. To-day he chose to be a hail fellow well met as  he walked about Salerno seeking information that would lead to his  financial interest.    By chance he met an old friend from Naples.    \"Aha, Guiseppe Capasso!\" the man cried. \"What good fate leads me to  you, or you to me, as it may be?\"    \"The luck is mine, signor,\" with a hearty hand-shake Guiseppe replied.  \"Out of Naples, where I was born and bred, I feel indeed a stranger in  a strange land.\"    \"Come, Guiseppe, let's celebrate our fortunate meeting. A game or  two--what do you say, my friend?\"    Together they visited a wine shop and there they drank and gambled at  \"Mora.\" Guiseppe lost.    \"I'll drink and forget,\" he cried. So he went from one wine shop to  another, drinking, losing, cursing his losses, drinking again to forget  his ill-luck.    When Marta saw him coming toward herself and Pappina, she knew at once  what the trouble was. She knew also that too much wine put him in an  ugly mood. She placed her arm about Pappina and kissed her brow.    \"Oh, _carissima_,\" she whispered, \"if you love me, be patient with  Guiseppe! He may abuse you, but remember that I love you.\"    Even before Marta had finished, Guiseppe was speaking.    \"There's no fete day here till September, St. Matthew's Day,\" he said.  Turning to Pappina, he continued: \"Look here, girl, we are going where  there will be a crowd of people promenading to-night. We are going  to the Quay--they call it Corso Garibaldi. I'll have none of your  impudence in that crowd to-night--none of your stubbornness; do you  understand? When I say sing, you will sing. When I say dance, you will  dance. Do you hear?\"    \"_Si_, signor,\" came faintly from Pappina's white lips. As she spoke  she glanced at Marta, stifling her anger for the sake of the woman she  loved.    \"Then remember.\" He shook his fist in her face. She flushed scarlet,  but said nothing. Guiseppe evidently was expecting a reply. He waited  a moment, then continued his tirade: \"Why don't you speak, girl? You  stand there, red in the face, ready to kill me, and say nothing. Have  out with it; what you've got to say I want to hear right now. I'll have  none of your impudence to-night.\"    There was no reply from the child, who stood looking in amazement at  Guiseppe, as she tightly held Marta's bony hand.    \"Oh, afraid of me for once, are you?\" he sneered. \"Marta, the minx is  afraid of me. Bravo! Bravo! I'll drink to her health as soon as we find  a wine-shop. Ha, ha, Marta! She's a coward, after all.\"    He stooped to pick up a coin he had dropped. Pappina, unable longer  to control herself, sprang at him in a furious rage. She gave him one  fierce slap across the cheek. With a cry of pain, he turned on the  child. Marta caught hold of him.    \"Guiseppe, Guiseppe,\" she cried, \"you'll lose her if you strike her.\"    Still he attempted to reach Pappina, blind in his drunken fury. Marta  held him with an iron grip.    \"Don't!\" she screamed. \"Don't! You shan't! She'll run away. Stop,  Guiseppe! You know you can't strike her and keep her.\"    Guiseppe shook Marta fiercely. Her sparse brown locks loosened and  fell about her livid face, but still she held him, and the drunken man  was no match for her. He struggled to break away, but Marta seemed to  possess superhuman strength. Her grip on his arm was so strong that it  pained him.    \"Let go, you fiend!\" he cried.    \"Never, Guiseppe, till you promise you will not harm her. She is only a  child.\"    \"You hurt me! Let go, I say!\"    \"Then promise.\"    \"Fiend, let go! I promise.\"    Guiseppe broke away from Marta. He glared at Pappina, who stood facing  him defiantly her head thrown back, her eyes blazing, her arms folded.    \"You little vixen!\" Guiseppe shouted, \"I'll make you rue this day!  You shall pay dearly for this!\" Smothering his anger, he took up the  Punchinellos. \"Come,\" he commanded, \"we will play to the crowds--all  night, if I will it. Come on, I say.\"                                        CHAPTER VII                            ANOTHER RECONCILIATION      Guiseppe, his cheek still smarting from Pappina's blow, strode along  toward the Quay and its beautiful walk, Corso Garibaldi.    In spite of his intoxication, Guiseppe was conscious of a new respect  for Marta, awakened by her fearless defence of the child she loved.    \"They are both against me,\" he muttered. \"Marta--staid, timid  Marta--she becomes a lioness when she fights for Pappina. Who would  believe it? But she is right, Marta's right. I can't beat the minx and  keep her. They are two against me, two against me.\"    Time and again he turned his head and glared fiercely from under his  shaggy eyebrows at Pappina, and without his usual bullying look at  Marta. His "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45573"],[0,"Out with Garibaldi: A story of the liberation of Italy (#11)"],[1,"she particularly wants to see  you, and will be glad if you will start at once. Of course I will do so;  you had better catch the next train, if you can.\"    \"What in the world can the mater want to see me in such a hurry for?\"  Frank said to himself in a rather discontented tone as he left the  master's study. \"It is a frightful nuisance missing the match this  afternoon! I don't know what Hawtrey will say when I tell him that I  cannot play. Ah! here he is.\"    \"What is up, Percival?\"    \"I am awfully sorry to say that I have just received a message from my  mater calling me up to town at once. I have no idea what it is about;  but it must be something particular, for I told her when I wrote to her  last that this was going to be the toughest match of the season; still,  of course I must go.\"    \"I see that, Percival. It is a terrible nuisance; you are certainly the  third best in the house, and now I shall have to put Fincham in, I  suppose, and I am afraid that will mean the loss of the match.\"    \"He is as strong as I am, Hawtrey.\"    \"Yes; he is strong enough and heavy enough, but he is desperately slow.  However, I must make the best of him.\"    Frank hurried upstairs, and in ten minutes came down again, dressed. He  ran the greater part of the way to the station, and just caught the up  train. The disappointment over the football match was forgotten now.  Thinking it over, he had come to the conclusion that either his mother  or grandmother must have been taken seriously ill. It could hardly be  his mother, for it was she who had written; still, she might have  managed to do that, even if she had met with some sort of accident, if  it was not too serious. If not she, it must be the signora, as he  generally called her, and as he was very fond of her, he felt that her  loss would be a heavy one indeed. His anxiety increased as he neared  London; and as soon as the train stopped at Euston he jumped out, seized  the first hansom, and told the cabman to drive fast to Cadogan Place. He  leaped out, handed his fare to the cabman, ran up the steps, and knocked  at the door.    \"Is every one well, Beppo?\" he asked breathlessly, as the servant opened  it.    \"Yes, sir,\" the footman replied, in his usual calm and even voice.    \"Thank God for that!\" he exclaimed. \"Where is my mother?\"    \"In the dining-room, sir, with the signora.\"    Frank ran upstairs. \"Mother, you have given me quite a fright,\" he said.  \"From your message I thought that some one must have been suddenly taken  ill, or you would never have sent for me when you knew that we played  in the final ties for the house championship to-day. I have been  worrying horribly all the way up to town.\"    \"I forgot all about your match, Frank,\" his mother said. \"I have had a  letter that put it out of my head entirely.\"    \"A letter, mother?\"    \"Yes, Frank; from your hero, Garibaldi.\"    \"What is it about, mother?\" Frank exclaimed excitedly, for he had heard  so much of the Italian patriot from his father, and of their doings  together in South America and the siege of Rome, that his admiration for  him was unbounded.    \"Sit down, Frank, and I will tell you all about it. The letter was  addressed to your dear father. Garibaldi, being in Caprera, probably has  but little news of what is passing at Naples. He had heard of my  father's disappearance, but was apparently in ignorance of what has  happened since.\"    She took out the letter and read:    \"'MY DEAR COMRADE AND FRIEND,--         \"'When I last wrote to you it was to condole with you on the       disappearance of that true patriot and my good friend, Professor       Forli. I hope that long ere this he has been restored to you; but       if, as I fear, he has fallen into the clutches of the rascally       government of Naples, I am afraid that you will never hear of him       again. Several times, when you have written to me, you have told me       that you were prepared to join me when I again raised the flag of       Italian independence, though you held aloof when France joined us       against Austria. You did rightly, for we were betrayed by the       French as we were at Rome, and my birthplace, Nice, has been handed       over to them. You also said that you would help us with money;       and, as you know, money is one of our chief requisites. The time       has come. I am convinced that the population of the Neapolitan       territories are now reduced to such a state of despair by the       tyranny of their government that they will be ready to hail us as       deliverers.         \"'My plan is this: I am sure a thousand or so of the men who fought       with me in the Alps will flock to my standard, and with these I       intend to effect a landing in Sicily. If I capture Palermo and       Messina I think I can rely upon being joined by no small number of       men there, and by volunteers from all parts of Italy; five thousand       men in all will be sufficient, I think--at any rate, that number       collected, I shall cross to the mainland and march upon Naples. You       may think that the adventure is a desperate one, but that is by no       means my opinion; you know how easily we defeated the Neapolitan       troops in 1848. I believe that we shall do so still more easily       now, for certainly very many of them must share in the general       hatred of the tyrant. Come, dear friend, and join us; the       meeting-place is called the Villa Spinola, which is a few miles       from Genoa.         \"'I do not anticipate any great interference from Cavour; he will       run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, as your proverb has it.       He dare not stop us; for I am convinced that such is the state of       public opinion in Italy, that it might cost his master his crown       were he to do so. On the other hand, he would be obliged to assume       an attitude of hostility, or he would incur the anger of Austria,       of the Papacy, and possibly of France; therefore I think that he       will remain neutral, although professing to do all in his power to       prevent our moving. I am promised some assistance in money, but I       am sure that this will fall short of the needs. We must buy arms       not only for ourselves, but to arm those who join us; we must       charter or buy steamers to carry us to Sicily. Once there, I regard       the rest as certain. Come to me with empty hands, and you will       receive the heartiest welcome as my dear friend and comrade; but if       you can aid us also with money, not only I, but all Italy, will be       grateful to you. I know that you need no inducement, for your heart       is wholly with us, and all the more so from this disappearance of       madame's father, doubtless the work of the tyrants. Need I say that       our first step in every town and fortress we capture will be to       release all political prisoners confined there?--and it may be that       among these we will find Professor Forli. Turr will be with me,       Baron Stocco of Calabria, Bixio, and Tuckory; and Madame Carroli       has written to tell me that she places her three sons at my       disposal in the place of their brave brother, and will, moreover,       supply me with money to the utmost of her power. Come, then, dear       friend, aid me with your arm and counsel, and let us again fight       side by side in the cause of liberty.'\"    Frank leapt to his feet. \"You will let me go in my father's place,  mother, will you not? Many of those who will follow Garibaldi will be no  older than myself, and probably not half so strong; none can hate the  tyranny of Naples more than I do. It is the cause for which my father  and grandfather fought; and we now have greater wrongs than they had to  avenge.\"    \"That is what I thought you would say, Frank,\" his mother said sadly.  \"'Tis hard indeed to part with a son after having lost father and  husband; but my father was an Italian patriot, my husband fought for  Italy; in giving you up I give up my all; yet I will not say you nay. So  fierce is the indignation in England at the horrors of the tyrants'  prisons that I doubt not many English will, when they hear of  Garibaldi's landing in Sicily, go out to join him; and if they are ready  in the cause only of humanity to risk their lives, surely we cannot  grudge you in the cause not only of humanity, but of the land of our  birth.\"    \"I feel sure that father would have taken me, had he been here,\" Frank  said earnestly.    \"I believe he would, Frank. I know that he shared to the full my  father's hatred of the despots who grind Italy under their heel; and  besides the feeling that animated him, one cannot but cherish the hope  that my father may still be found alive in one of those ghastly prisons.  Of course my mother and I have talked the matter over. We both lament  that your studies should be interrupted; but it can be for a few months  only, and probably you will be able to return to Harrow when the school  meets again after the long holiday--so that, in fact, you will only lose  three months or so.\"    \"That makes no odds one way or another, mother. In any case, I am not  likely to be a shining light in the way of learning.\"    \"No--I suppose not, Frank; and with a fine estate awaiting you, there is  no occasion that you should be, though of course you will go through  Oxford or Cambridge. However, we need not think of that now.\"    \"And will you be sending him any money, mother?\"    \"Certainly. Your father put by a certain sum every year in order that he  might assist Garibaldi when the latter again raised the flag of freedom  in Italy--a cause which was sacred in his eyes. At the time he left  England, this fund amounted to L10,000; and as he never knew when the  summons from Garibaldi might arrive, he transferred it to my name, so  that he need not come back to England, should a rising occur before his  return. So you will not go empty-handed.\"    "]]]
