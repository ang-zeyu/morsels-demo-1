I had now despatched four caravans into the interior, and the fifth,  which was to carry the boats and boxes, personal luggage, and a few  cloth and bead loads, was ready to be led by myself. The following is  the order of departure of the caravans.    1871. Feb. 6.--Expedition arrived at Bagamoyo.    1871. Feb. 18.--First caravan departs with twenty-four pagazis and three  soldiers.    1871. Feb. 21.--Second caravan departs with twenty-eight pagazis, two  chiefs, and two soldiers.    1871. Feb. 25.--Third caravan departs with twenty-two pagazis, ten  donkeys, one white man, one cook, and three soldiers.    1871. March. 11.--Fourth caravan departs with fifty-five pagazis, two  chiefs, and three soldiers.    1871. March. 21.--Fifth caravan departs with twenty-eight pagazis,  twelve soldiers, two white men, one tailor, one cook, one interpreter,  one gun-bearer, seventeen asses, two horses, and one dog.    Total number, inclusive of all souls, comprised in caravans connected  with the \"New York Herald' Expedition,\" 192.        CHAPTER V. -- THROUGH UKWERE, UKAMI, AND UDOE TO USEGUHHA.           Leaving Bagamoyo for the interior.--Constructing a Bridge.--       Our first troubles.--Shooting Hippopotami.--A first view of       the Game Land.--Anticipating trouble with the Wagogo.--The       dreadful poison--flies.--Unlucky adventures while hunting.--       The cunning chief of Kingaru.--Sudden death of my two       horses.--A terrible experience.--The city of the \"Lion       Lord.\"      On the 21st of March, exactly seventy-three days after my arrival at  Zanzibar, the fifth caravan, led by myself, left the town of Bagamoyo  for our first journey westward, with \"Forward!\" for its mot du guet. As  the kirangozi unrolled the American flag, and put himself at the head of  the caravan, and the pagazis, animals, soldiers, and idlers were lined  for the march, we bade a long farewell to the dolce far niente of  civilised life, to the blue ocean, and to its open road to home, to the  hundreds of dusky spectators who were there to celebrate our departure  with repeated salvoes of musketry.    Our caravan is composed of twenty-eight pagazis, including the  kirangozi, or guide; twelve soldiers under Capt. Mbarak Bombay, in  charge of seventeen donkeys and their loads; Selim, my interpreter, in  charge of the donkey and cart and its load; one cook and sub, who is  also to be tailor and ready hand for all, and leads the grey horse;  Shaw, once mate of a ship, now transformed into rearguard and overseer  for the caravan, who is mounted on a good riding-donkey, and wearing a  canoe-like tepee and sea-boots; and lastly, on, the splendid bay horse  presented to me by Mr. Goodhue, myself, called Bana Mkuba, \"the big  master,\" by my people--the vanguard, the reporter, the thinker, and  leader of the Expedition.    Altogether the Expedition numbers on the day of departure three white  men, twenty-three soldiers, four supernumeraries, four chiefs, and one  hundred and fifty-three pagazis, twenty-seven donkeys, and one cart,  conveying cloth, beads, and wire, boat-fixings, tents, cooking utensils  and dishes, medicine, powder, small shot, musket-balls, and metallic  cartridges; instruments and small necessaries, such as soap, sugar, tea,  coffee, Liebig's extract of meat, pemmican, candles, &c., which make  a total of 153 loads. The weapons of defence which the Expedition  possesses consist of one double-barrel breech-loading gun, smooth bore;  one American Winchester rifle, or \"sixteen-shooter;\" one Henry rifle,  or \"sixteen-shooter;\" two Starr's breech-loaders, one Jocelyn  breech-loader, one elephant rifle, carrying balls eight to the pound;  two breech-loading revolvers, twenty-four muskets (flint locks), six  single-barrelled pistols, one battle-axe, two swords, two daggers  (Persian kummers, purchased at Shiraz by myself), one boar-spear,  two American axes 4 lbs. each, twenty-four hatchets, and twenty-four  butcher-knives.      The Expedition has been fitted with care; whatever it needed was not  stinted; everything was provided. Nothing was done too hurriedly, yet  everything was purchased, manufactured, collected, and compounded with  the utmost despatch consistent with efficiency and means. Should it fail  of success in its errand of rapid transit to Ujiji and back, it must  simply happen from an accident which could not be controlled. So much  for the _personnel_ of the Expedition and its purpose, until its _point  de mire_ be reached.    We left Bagamoyo the attraction of all the curious, with much eclat, and  defiled up a narrow lane shaded almost to twilight by the dense umbrage  of two parallel hedges of mimosas. We were all in the highest spirits.  The soldiers sang, the kirangozi lifted his voice into a loud bellowing  note, and fluttered the American flag, which told all on-lookers, \"Lo, a  Musungu's caravan!\" and my heart, I thought, palpitated much too quickly  for the sober face of a leader. But I could not check it; the enthusiasm  of youth still clung to me--despite my travels; my pulses bounded with  the full glow of staple health; behind me were the troubles which had  harassed me for over two months. With that dishonest son of a Hindi,  Soor Hadji Palloo, I had said my last word; of the blatant rabble, of  Arabs, Banyans, and Baluches I had taken my last look; with the Jesuits  of the French Mission I had exchanged farewells, and before me beamed  the sun of promise as he sped towards the Occident. Loveliness glowed  around me. I saw fertile fields, riant vegetation, strange trees--I  heard the cry of cricket and pee-wit, and sibilant sound of many  insects, all of which seemed to tell me, \"At last you are started.\" What  could I do but lift my face toward the pure-glowing sky, and cry, \"God  be thanked!\"    The first camp, Shamba Gonera, we arrived at in 1 hour 30 minutes, equal  to 3 1/4 miles. This first, or \"little journey,\" was performed very  well, \"considering,\" as the Irishman says. The boy Selim upset the cart  not more than three times. Zaidi, the soldier, only once let his donkey,  which carried one bag of my clothes and a box of ammunition, lie in  a puddle of black water. The clothes have to be re-washed; the  ammunition-box, thanks to my provision, was waterproof. Kamna perhaps  knew the art of donkey-driving, but, overjoyful at the departure, had  sung himself into oblivion of the difficulties with which an animal of  the pure asinine breed has naturally to contend against, such as not  knowing the right road, and inability to resist the temptation of  straying into the depths of a manioc field; and the donkey, ignorant of  the custom in vogue amongst ass-drivers of flourishing sticks before  an animal's nose, and misunderstanding the direction in which he was  required to go, ran off at full speed along an opposite road, until his  pack got unbalanced, and he was fain to come to the earth. But these  incidents were trivial, of no importance, and natural to the first  \"little journey\" in East Africa.    The soldiers' point of character leaked out just a little. Bombay turned  out to be honest and trusty, but slightly disposed to be dilatory.  Uledi did more talking than work; while the runaway Ferajji and the  useless-handed Mabruki Burton turned out to be true men and staunch,  carrying loads the sight of which would have caused the strong-limbed  hamals of Stamboul to sigh.    The saddles were excellent, surpassing expectation. The strong hemp  canvas bore its one hundred and fifty-pounds' burden with the strength  of bull hide, and the loading and unloading of miscellaneous baggage  was performed with systematic despatch. In brief, there was nothing to  regret--the success of the journey proved our departure to be anything  but premature.    The next three days were employed in putting the finishing touches to  our preparations for the long land journey and our precautions against  the Masika, which was now ominously near, and in settling accounts.    Shamba Gonera means Gonera's Field. Gonera is a wealthy Indian widow,  well disposed towards the Wasungu (whites). She exports much cloth,  beads, and wire into the far interior, and imports in return much ivory.  Her house is after the model of the town houses, with long sloping roof  and projecting eaves, affording a cool shade, under which the pagazis  love to loiter. On its southern and eastern side stretch the cultivated  fields which supply Bagamoyo with the staple grain, matama, of East  Africa; on the left grow Indian corn, and muhogo, a yam-like root  of whitish colour, called by some manioc; when dry, it is ground and  compounded into cakes similar to army slapjacks. On the north, just  behind the house, winds a black quagmire, a sinuous hollow, which in  its deepest parts always contains water--the muddy home of the  brake-and-rush-loving \"kiboko\" or hippopotamus. Its banks, crowded  with dwarf fan-palm, tall water-reeds, acacias, and tiger-grass, afford  shelter to numerous aquatic birds, pelicans, &c. After following a  course north-easterly, it conflows with the Kingani, which, at distance  of four miles from Gonera's country-house; bends eastward into the sea.  To the west, after a mile of cultivation, fall and recede in succession  the sea-beach of old in lengthy parallel waves, overgrown densely  with forest grass and marsh reeds. On the spines of these land-swells  flourish ebony, calabash, and mango.    \"Sofari--sofari leo! Pakia, pakia!\"--\"A journey--a journey to day! Set  out!--set out!\" rang the cheery voice of the kirangozi, echoed by that  of my servant Selim, on the morning of the fourth day, which was fixed  for our departure in earnest. As I hurried my men to their work, and  lent a hand with energy to drop the tents, I mentally resolved that,  if my "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/517"],[0,"The Emerald City of Oz (#11)"],[1,"pardon, I'm sure,\" said the Wizard, regretfully.  \"I didn't  know you were so delicate.\"    \"We're not delicate!\" retorted another soldier, raising his head from  the ground.  \"We are strong and healthy; but we can't stand draughts.\"    \"May I help you up?\" asked Dorothy.    \"If you please,\" replied the end soldier.  \"But do it gently, little  girl.\"    Dorothy carefully stood up the line of soldiers, who first dusted their  painted clothes and then saluted the visitors with their paper muskets.  From the end it was easy to see that the entire line had been cut out  of paper, although from the front the soldiers looked rather solid and  imposing.    \"I've a letter of introduction from Princess Ozma to Miss Cuttenclip,\"  announced Dorothy.    \"Very well,\" said the end soldier, and blew upon a paper whistle that  hung around his neck.  At once a paper soldier in a Captain's uniform  came out of a paper house near by and approached the group at the  entrance.  He was not very big, and he walked rather stiffly and  uncertainly on his paper legs; but he had a pleasant face, with very  red cheeks and very blue eyes, and he bowed so low to the strangers  that Dorothy laughed, and the breeze from her mouth nearly blew the  Captain over.  He wavered and struggled and finally managed to remain  upon his feet.    \"Take care, Miss!\" he said, warningly.  \"You're breaking the rules, you  know, by laughing.\"    \"Oh, I didn't know that,\" she replied.    \"To laugh in this place is nearly as dangerous as to cough,\" said the  Captain.  \"You'll have to breathe very quietly, I assure you.\"    \"We'll try to,\" promised the girl.  \"May we see Miss Cuttenclip,  please?\"    \"You may,\" promptly returned the Captain.  \"This is one of her  reception days.  Be good enough to follow me.\"    He turned and led the way up a path, and as they followed slowly,  because the paper Captain did not move very swiftly, they took the  opportunity to gaze around them at this strange paper country.    Beside the path were paper trees, all cut out very neatly and painted a  brilliant green color.  And back of the trees were rows of cardboard  houses, painted in various colors but most of them having green blinds.  Some were large and some small, and in the front yards were beds of  paper flowers quite natural in appearance.  Over some of the porches  paper vines were twined, giving them a cozy and shady look.    As the visitors passed along the street a good many paper dolls came to  the doors and windows of their houses to look at them curiously.  These  dolls were nearly all the same height, but were cut into various  shapes, some being fat and some lean.  The girl dolls wore many  beautiful costumes of tissue paper, making them quite fluffy; but their  heads and hands were no thicker than the paper of which they were made.    Some of the paper people were on the street, walking along or  congregated in groups and talking together; but as soon as they saw the  strangers they all fluttered into the houses as fast as they could go,  so as to be out of danger.    \"Excuse me if I go edgewise,\" remarked the Captain as they came to a  slight hill.  \"I can get along faster that way and not flutter so much.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Dorothy.  \"We don't mind how you go, I'm sure.\"    At one side of the street was a paper pump, and a paper boy was pumping  paper water into a paper pail.  The Yellow Hen happened to brush  against this boy with her wing, and he flew into the air and fell into  a paper tree, where he stuck until the Wizard gently pulled him out.  At the same time, the pail went into the air, spilling the paper water,  while the paper pump bent nearly double.    \"Goodness me!\" said the Hen.  \"If I should flop my wings I believe I'd  knock over the whole village!\"    \"Then don't flop them--please don't!\" entreated the Captain.  \"Miss  Cuttenclip would be very much distressed if her village was spoiled.\"    \"Oh, I'll be careful,\" promised Billina.    \"Are not all these paper girls and women named Miss Cuttenclips?\"  inquired Omby Amby.    \"No indeed,\" answered the Captain, who was walking better since he  began to move edgewise.  \"There is but one Miss Cuttenclip, who is our  Queen, because she made us all.  These girls are Cuttenclips, to be  sure, but their names are Emily and Polly and Sue and Betty and such  things.  Only the Queen is called Miss Cuttenclip.\"    \"I must say that this place beats anything I ever heard of,\" observed  Aunt Em.  \"I used to play with paper dolls myself, an' cut 'em out; but  I never thought I'd ever see such things alive.\"    \"I don't see as it's any more curious than hearing hens talk,\" returned  Uncle Henry.    \"You're likely to see many queer things in the Land of Oz, sir,\" said  the Wizard.  \"But a fairy country is extremely interesting when you get  used to being surprised.\"    \"Here we are!\" called the Captain, stopping before a cottage.    This house was made of wood, and was remarkably pretty in design.  In  the Emerald City it would have been considered a tiny dwelling, indeed;  but in the midst of this paper village it seemed immense.  Real flowers  were in the garden and real trees grew beside it.  Upon the front door  was a sign reading:      MISS CUTTENCLIP.      Just as they reached the porch the front door opened and a little girl  stood before them.  She appeared to be about the same age as Dorothy,  and smiling upon her visitors she said, sweetly:    \"You are welcome.\"    All the party seemed relieved to find that here was a real girl, of  flesh and blood.  She was very dainty and pretty as she stood there  welcoming them.  Her hair was a golden blonde and her eyes turquoise  blue.  She had rosy cheeks and lovely white teeth.  Over her simple  white lawn dress she wore an apron with pink and white checks, and in  one hand she held a pair of scissors.    \"May we see Miss Cuttenclip, please?\" asked Dorothy.    \"I am Miss Cuttenclip,\" was the reply.  \"Won't you come in?\"    She held the door open while they all entered a pretty sitting-room  that was littered with all sorts of paper--some stiff, some thin, and  some tissue.  The sheets and scraps were of all colors.  Upon a table  were paints and brushes, while several pair of scissors, of different  sizes, were lying about.    \"Sit down, please,\" said Miss Cuttenclip, clearing the paper scraps off  some of the chairs.  \"It is so long since I have had any visitors that  I am not properly prepared to receive them.  But I'm sure you will  pardon my untidy room, for this is my workshop.\"    \"Do you make all the paper dolls?\" inquired Dorothy.    \"Yes; I cut them out with my scissors, and paint the faces and some of  the costumes.  It is very pleasant work, and I am happy making my paper  village grow.\"    \"But how do the paper dolls happen to be alive?\" asked Aunt Em.    \"The first dolls I made were not alive,\" said Miss Cuttenclip.  \"I used  to live near the castle of a great Sorceress named Glinda the Good, and  she saw my dolls and said they were very pretty.  I told her I thought  I would like them better if they were alive, and the next day the  Sorceress brought me a lot of magic paper.  'This is live paper,' she  said, 'and all the dolls you cut out of it will be alive, and able to  think and to talk.  When you have used it all up, come to me and I will  give you more.'    \"Of course I was delighted with this present,\" continued Miss  Cuttenclip, \"and at once set to work and made several paper dolls,  which, as soon as they were cut out, began to walk around and talk to  me.  But they were so thin that I found that any breeze would blow them  over and scatter them dreadfully; so Glinda found this lonely place for  me, where few people ever come.  She built the wall to keep any wind  from blowing away my people, and told me I could build a paper village  here and be its Queen.  That is why I came here and settled down to  work and started the village you now see.  It was many years ago that I  built the first houses, and I've kept pretty busy and made my village  grow finely; and I need not tell you that I am very happy in my work.\"    \"Many years ago!\" exclaimed Aunt Em.  \"Why, how old are you, child?\"    \"I never keep track of the years,\" said Miss Cuttenclip, laughing.  \"You see, I don't grow up at all, but stay just the same as I was when  first I came here.  Perhaps I'm older even than you are, madam; but I  couldn't say for sure.\"    They looked at the lovely little girl wonderingly, and the Wizard asked:    \"What happens to your paper village when it rains?\"    \"It does not rain here,\" replied Miss Cuttenclip.  \"Glinda keeps all  the rain storms away; so I never worry about my dolls getting wet.  But  now, if you will come with me, it will give me pleasure to show you  over my paper kingdom.  Of course you must go slowly and carefully, and  avoid making any breeze.\"    They left the cottage and followed their guide through the various  streets of the village.  It was indeed an amazing place, when one  considered that it was all made with scissors, and the visitors were  not only greatly interested but full of admiration for the skill of  little Miss Cuttenclip.    In one place a large group of especially nice paper dolls assembled to  greet their Queen, whom it was easy to see they loved early.  These  dolls marched and danced before the visitors, and then they all waved  their paper handkerchiefs and sang in a sweet chorus a song called \"The  Flag of Our Native Land.\"    At the conclusion of the song they ran up a handsome paper flag on a  tall flagpole, and all of the people of the village gathered around to  cheer as loudly as they could--although, of course, their voices were  not especially strong.    Miss Cuttenclip was about to make her subjects a speech in reply to  this patriotic song, when the Shaggy Man happened to sneeze.    He was a very loud and powerful sneezer at any time, and he had tried  so hard to hold in this sneeze"]]]
