That's what he's saying, plain  as gospel!  I can tell it plainer'n anything he's sung yet, now I sense  it.\"    He gathered Maria in his arms, pressed her head against his breast with  a trembling old hand, while the face he turned to the morning was  beautiful.    \"I wish to God,\" he said quaveringly, \"'at every creature on earth was  as well fixed as me an' the redbird!\" Clasping each other, they  listened with rapt faces, as, mellowing across the corn field, came the  notes of the Cardinal: \"So dear! So dear!\"    After that Abram's devotion to his bird family became a mild mania.  He  carried food to the top rail of the line fence every day, rain or  shine, with the same regularity that he curried and fed Nancy in the  barn.  From caring for and so loving the Cardinal, there grew in his  tender old heart a welling flood of sympathy for every bird that homed  on his farm.    He drove a stake to mark the spot where the killdeer hen brooded in the  corn field, so that he would not drive Nancy over the nest.  When he  closed the bars at the end of the lane, he always was careful to leave  the third one down, for there was a chippy brooding in the opening  where it fitted when closed.  Alders and sweetbriers grew in his fence  corners undisturbed that spring if he discovered that they sheltered an  anxious-eyed little mother.  He left a square yard of clover unmowed,  because it seemed to him that the lark, singing nearer the Throne than  any other bird, was picking up stray notes dropped by the Invisible  Choir, and with unequalled purity and tenderness, sending them ringing  down to his brooding mate, whose home and happiness would be despoiled  by the reaping of that spot of green.  He delayed burning the  brush-heap from the spring pruning, back of the orchard, until fall,  when he found it housed a pair of fine thrushes; for the song of the  thrush delighted him almost as much as that of the lark.  He left a  hollow limb on the old red pearmain apple-tree, because when he came to  cut it there was a pair of bluebirds twittering around, frantic with  anxiety.    His pockets were bulgy with wheat and crumbs, and his heart was big  with happiness.  It was the golden springtime of his later life.  The  sky never had seemed so blue, or the earth so beautiful.  The Cardinal  had opened the fountains of his soul; life took on a new colour and  joy; while every work of God manifested a fresh and heretofore  unappreciated loveliness.  His very muscles seemed to relax, and new  strength arose to meet the demands of his uplifted spirit.  He had not  finished his day's work with such ease and pleasure in years; and he  could see the influence of his rejuvenation in Maria.  She was flitting  around her house with broken snatches of song, even sweeter to Abram's  ears than the notes of the birds; and in recent days he had noticed  that she dressed particularly for her afternoon's sewing, putting on  her Sunday lace collar and a white apron.  He immediately went to town  and bought her a finer collar than she ever had owned in her life.    Then he hunted a sign painter, and came home bearing a number of pine  boards on which gleamed in big, shiny black letters:      +----------------------+    |  NO HUNTING ALLOWED  |    |     ON THIS FARM     |    +----------------------+      He seemed slightly embarrassed when he showed them to Maria.  \"I feel a  little mite onfriendly, putting up signs like that 'fore my  neighbours,\" he admitted, \"but the fact is, it ain't the neighbours so  much as it's boys that need raising, an' them town creatures who call  themselves sportsmen, an' kill a hummin'-bird to see if they can hit  it.  Time was when trees an' underbrush were full o' birds an'  squirrels, any amount o' rabbits, an' the fish fairly crowdin' in the  river.  I used to kill all the quail an' wild turkeys about here a body  needed to make an appetizing change, It was always my plan to take a  little an' leave a little.  But jest look at it now.  Surprise o' my  life if I get a two-pound bass.  Wild turkey gobblin' would scare me  most out of my senses, an', as for the birds, there are jest about a  fourth what there used to be, an' the crops eaten to pay for it.  I'd  do all I'm tryin' to for any bird, because of its song an' colour, an'  pretty teeterin' ways, but I ain't so slow but I see I'm paid in what  they do for me.  Up go these signs, an' it won't be a happy day for  anybody I catch trespassin' on my birds.\"    Maria studied the signs meditatively.  \"You shouldn't be forced to put  'em up,\" she said conclusively.  \"If it's been decided 'at it's good  for 'em to be here, an' laws made to protect 'em, people ought to act  with some sense, an' leave them alone.  I never was so int'rested in  the birds in all my life; an' I'll jest do a little lookin' out myself.  If you hear a spang o' the dinner bell when you're out in the field,  you'll know it means there's some one sneakin' 'round with a gun.\"    Abram caught Maria, and planted a resounding smack on her cheek, where  the roses of girlhood yet bloomed for him.  Then he filled his pockets  with crumbs and grain, and strolled to the river to set the Cardinal's  table.  He could hear the sharp incisive \"Chip!\" and the tender mellow  love-notes as he left the barn; and all the way to the sumac they rang  in his ears.    The Cardinal met him at the corner of the field, and hopped over bushes  and the fence only a few yards from him.  When Abram had scattered his  store on the rail, the bird came tipping and tilting, daintily caught  up a crumb, and carried it to the sumac.  His mate was pleased to take  it; and he carried her one morsel after another until she refused to  open her beak for more.  He made a light supper himself; and then  swinging on the grape-vine, he closed the day with an hour of music.  He repeatedly turned a bright questioning eye toward Abram, but he  never for a moment lost sight of the nest and the plump gray figure of  his little mate.  As she brooded over her eggs, he brooded over her;  and that she might realize the depth and constancy of his devotion, he  told her repeatedly, with every tender inflection he could throw into  his tones, that she was \"So dear! So dear!\"    The Cardinal had not known that the coming of the mate he so coveted  would fill his life with such unceasing gladness, and yet, on the very  day that happiness seemed at fullest measure, there was trouble in the  sumac.  He had overstayed his time, chasing a fat moth he particularly  wanted for his mate, and she, growing thirsty past endurance, left the  nest and went to the river.  Seeing her there, he made all possible  haste to take his turn at brooding, so he arrived just in time to see a  pilfering red squirrel starting away with an egg.    With a vicious scream the Cardinal struck him full force.  His rush of  rage cost the squirrel an eye; but it lost the father a birdling, for  the squirrel dropped the egg outside the nest.  The Cardinal mournfully  carried away the tell-tale bits of shell, so that any one seeing them  would not look up and discover his treasures.  That left three eggs;  and the brooding bird mourned over the lost one so pitifully that the  Cardinal perched close to the nest the remainder of the day, and  whispered over and over for her comfort that she was \"So dear! So dear!\"        Chapter 5    \"See here! See here!\" demanded the Cardinal      The mandate repeatedly rang from the topmost twig of the thorn tree,  and yet the Cardinal was not in earnest.  He was beside himself with a  new and delightful excitement, and he found it impossible to refrain  from giving vent to his feelings.  He was commanding the farmer and  every furred and feathered denizen of the river bottom to see; then he  fought like a wild thing if any of them ventured close, for great  things were happening in the sumac.    In past days the Cardinal had brooded an hour every morning while his  mate went to take her exercise, bathe, and fluff in the sun parlour.  He had gone to her that morning as usual, and she looked at him with  anxious eyes and refused to move.  He had hopped to the very edge of  the nest and repeatedly urged her to go.  She only ruffled her  feathers, and nestled the eggs she was brooding to turn them, but did  not offer to leave.  The Cardinal reached over and gently nudged her  with his beak, to remind her that it was his time to brood; but she  looked at him almost savagely, and gave him a sharp peck; so he knew  she was not to be bothered.  He carried her every dainty he could find  and hovered near her, tense with anxiety.    It was late in the afternoon before she went after the drink for which  she was half famished.  She scarcely had reached a willow and bent over  the water before the Cardinal was on the edge of the nest.  He examined  it closely, but he could see no change.  He leaned to give the eggs  careful scrutiny, and from somewhere there came to him the faintest  little \"Chip!\" he ever had heard.  Up went the Cardinal's crest, and he  dashed to the willow.  There was no danger in sight; and his mate was  greedily dipping her rosy beak in the water.  He went back to the  cradle and listened intently, and again that feeble cry came to him.  Under the nest, around it, and all through the sumac he searched, until  at last, completely baffled, he came back to the edge.  The sound was  so much plainer there, that he suddenly leaned, caressing the eggs with  his beak; then the Cardinal knew!  He had heard the first faint cries  of his shell-incased babies!    With a wild scream he made a flying leap through the air.  His heart  was beating to suffocation.  He started in a race down the river.  If  he alighted on a bush he took only one swing, and springing from it  flamed on in headlong flight.  He flashed to the top of the tallest  tulip"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#11)"],[1,"spot, was a  low vaulted passage, which communicated, in ancient times, with the  servants' offices, and formed an angle with a lofty chapel, now used  as an ante-room; and here Kate again paused, as if to take the scene  into her memory. To the Chapter house, opposite the end opening on  the cloisters, was a beautiful window, showing through its lace-like  and still perfect tracery, the soft, green grass which clothed the  quadrangle formed by the cloisters, and a thorn tree grew close against  its mullions, and even thrust its branches, so delicately green, with  the first fresh and unspeakable tints of spring, through their many  openings; contrasting its fair youth, with the solemn grey and massive  stones around it. A bright gleam of sunshine, which fell slanting, it  up one half the chapel, through which Kate advanced, leaving the other  in shadow. The unbroken stillness, the air of deep repose, which  pervaded the old pile, gave something of its own calm to her feelings,  which had been a little ruffled by the thousand anticipations her  argument with Winter had called up. The hour of evening prayer was not  yet arrived, and she stood for a while gazing at the exquisite effects  of light and shade, till the perfect silence woke up her fancy, and she  smiled to think, that it would scarce surprise her, to see a plumed  and helmetted shadow fall on the stream of sunshine, which bathed the  pavement with a flood of gold, and even were the shadow followed by a  substantial mailed form, with knightly spurs, and cross-hilted sword,  it would seem but natural, here.    The distant sound of the organ warned her that the service was about to  begin, and she was soon kneeling in the quiet nook she usually occupied.    The next morning they left A----.    \"The last journey I made by rail-road was with you to Carrington,\" said  Kate to Winter.    She was looking a little pale, and a certain anxious nervousness made  her tremble in every limb; but she kept up very cheerfully.    They were standing on the platform at the railway station, waiting for  the train, which, starting from some newer and more important place,  only gave a few hurried, breathless moments to poor old anti-locomotive  A----.    The Colonel was looking a shade more elegant even than usual, in a  large cloak, which hung gracefully round his tall, erect form. There  was their luggage all ticketed and piled up, all of home that could be  packed into trunks; and Kate felt singularly desolate at the idea of  being thus, for the first time, without any sanctuary, however humble,  to which, as to an ark, she might retreat, when the fountains of the  great deep, of sorrow or of disappointment, were broken up; and Mrs.  Winter was there with a well-packed basket of sandwiches, and wine and  water; but poor Gilpin had been so unwell since his imprudent visit  to the Priory, that he had been obliged to leave the Winters to do  the parting honours, alone, to their valued friends. Nor can we omit  to mention Mrs. O'Toole, who, in a black silk bonnet, snowy cap, and  substantial cloth cloak, albeit it was early June, looked the very  model of a respectable old family-servant; over one arm hung Miss  Vernon's shawl, and, in her left hand, she carried a blue band-box,  containing divers and sundry articles thrust into it, at the last  moment, and secured by a red silk handkerchief.    \"Yes,\" returned Winter, in reply to Kate's observation, \"we were a  merry trio; but we little anticipated the adventure you contrived to  get up.\"    \"It was all very curious,\" said Kate, with a sigh, as her thoughts flew  back to that pleasant evening, and its still pleasanter _dénouément_.    A shrill, piercing whistle! The porters stood, not to their arms, but  to their trunks.    \"Up-train coming,\" said one of them, warningly, to our little party.    \"Now then, don't be in a hurry, Colonel--get the tickets all right,\"  said Winter; and the huge, hissing, relentless monster of an engine,  rushed panting by the platform. \"Do you get in and settle yourselves,  Colonel; Mrs. O'Toole and I will see to the luggage.\"    The Colonel obeyed; but Kate stood by the carriage door. Winter soon  bustled back, and in more than usually husky tones, observed--    \"All right--there goes the bell.\"    \"Dearest Mrs. Winter,\" cried Kate, clasping that worthy little woman  in her arms; \"good bye;\" and the tears she had long, with difficulty,  restrained, poured down her cheeks; then turning to the kind, rough  artist, she, somewhat to his surprise, bestowed an equally affectionate  embrace on him, with such childlike simplicity and sincere feeling,  that he was inexpressibly touched. \"My kind love to Mr. Gilpin; and, I  need hardly say, take care of Cormac.\"    \"God bless you, dear Kate,\" from both the Winters, and she was hurried  into the carriage, where nurse was already seated. A jerk back, and  then forward, and they were swept away from the kind faces that looked  so eagerly after them.    As long as the neighbouring scenery presented any familiar features,  Kate looked mournfully and wistfully through the window; but soon, too  soon, they were flying beyond the limits of her longest walks; and  when the distant height, crowned by Mowbray Castle, longest visible,  because the highest point in the surrounding country, disappeared, she  dismissed her regrets, turned resolutely from the contemplation of  past happiness, and determined to let no selfish grief, no personal  consideration whatever intervene between her heart and its great task.  Comforting and supporting her grandfather.    \"And you feel quite well, quite comfortable, dear grandfather.\"    \"Yes, love. Why, this is as good as any private carriage; you know I am  quite a novice in rail-road travelling. How do you like it, Nelly?\"    \"Faith, an' it's an illigant coach intirely; but, Miss Kate, jewel, did  iver ye see anything so fast as the hedges do be runnin'?\"    \"Yes,\" laughed the Colonel, \"London will be down here presently!\"    There is little ever to relate of a journey by rail--at least, at the  time of which we write, when excursion trains and concussions were  not quite such every-day events as in 1851-2. Little occurred to vary  the even tenor of their course. Speed was slackened, bells rung, and  incomprehensible names bawled out at the due number of stations. One  or two companions were added to, and diminished from their number,  with whom the Colonel entered, urbanely, into conversation, and, about  two o'clock, offered them refreshment, from Mrs. Winter's well-stored  basket, which was thankfully accepted by his fellow-travellers, who set  him down, in their private opinions, as some condescending nobleman  of philanthropic habits, and enjoyed his sandwiches and sherry with  redoubled goût. Could they have known, he was a broken gentleman,  and an Irish one to boot, how soon \"urbane condescension\" would have  changed, to pushing forwardness, and the gracious offer of a sandwich,  to some deep design of getting up an acquaintance, with ulterior  objects possibly still more dreadful.    At length, the closer ranks of houses and increasing hubbub of hissing  engines, and departing trains, warned them, they were fast approaching  the great metropolis.    The quiet and ease of their journey was at an end, the moment  they stepped from the retirement of the carriage into the bustling  confusion of the platform, beyond which a line of cabs were drawn  up, the length of which positively appalled Kate, as indicative of  the immense crowd amongst whom they would have to struggle for their  luggage. The additional difficulty of darkness was superadded to those  already arising from crowd and hurry; for they had not left A---- until  considerably past noon.    \"Och, Holy Virgin! how are we iver to get the thrunks in sich a  scrimmige!\" ejaculated Mrs. O'Toole.    \"We must look for the van they put them in at A----,\" said Kate, who  was trembling with nervous anxiety, and depressed, at feeling how  unfitted she was for so bustling a scene.    \"Jest don't be walkin off wid the masther's portmanty,\" said Mrs.  O'Toole, laying a vigorous grasp on the arm of a railway porter.    \"Is this here yer's?\"    \"Yes, an' so is the black wan, an' the wan wid the leather cover in the  van, &c.\"    And soon the civil and expeditious porters had placed all their luggage  in a goodly pile.    \"Now,\" said the Colonel, \"for the transit to Bayswater.\"    \"Cab, sir?\"    \"Yes, two.\"    The Colonel and Kate led the way with their light parcels, and nurse  followed with an overflowing cargo.    It is a strange sensation, that of whirling through unknown streets by  gas light. The complete ignorance of where you are going, the seemingly  miraculous facility with which you are whisked round innumerable  turnings, the flaring gas-light before the meaner shops, and short  intervals of gloomy, respectable quarters.    Kate felt all this strongly, and sat gazing at the busy crowded  streets, holding her grandfather's hand, and scarcely breathing. It  seemed as though she had never felt the changes that had occurred in  their lot before, and wearied by the journey, and the busy days that  preceded it, she experienced that dread fluttering sensation, half  fear, half excitement that made her long, oh, how intensely, for some  familiar face to welcome them, some strong calm friend into whose arms  she might throw herself, and feel _safe_.    But, \"fate forbid such things to be,\" and a curtseying landlady  received them in all the glories of an \"afternoon toilette,\" with an  elaborate front, cunningly secured with three rows of narrow black  velvet round the head, and a profusion of cherry-colored ribbons in her  cap.    \"Here, Hester, carry up the carpet bags; Mr. Langley was here to-day  ma'am, and said we might hexpect you about height o'clock, but it's  near nine now; what would you please to take? I'll have candles lighted  in a moment.\"    And she ushered"]]]
