Anson, Cook, and Vancouver, Parry, Franklin, M'Clintock, and M'Clure,  among a host of others, stand worthily by the side of our fighting  sailors, because made of the same stuff. Let us also, then, for a time,  leave behind the smoke and din, the glories and horrors of war, and cool  our fevered imaginations by descending, in spirit at least, to the depths  of the great sea. The records of the famous voyage of the _Challenger_(24)  will afford a capital opportunity of contrasting the deeds of the men of  peace with those of men of war.    We may commence by saying that no such voyage has in truth ever been  undertaken before.(25) Nearly 70,000 miles of the earth's watery surface  were traversed, and the Atlantic and Pacific crossed and recrossed several  times. It was a veritable _voyage en zigzag_. Apart from ordinary  soundings innumerable, 374 deep-sea soundings, when the progress of the  vessel had to be stopped, and which occupied an hour or two apiece, were  made, and at least two-thirds as many successful dredgings and trawlings.  The greatest depth of ocean reached was 4,575 fathoms (27,450 feet), or  _over five miles_. This was in the Pacific, about 1,400 miles S.E. of  Japan. We all know that this ocean derives its name from its generally  calmer weather and less tempestuous seas; and the researches of the  officers of the _Challenger_, and of the United States vessel _Tuscarora_,  show that the bottom slopes to its greatest depths very evenly and  gradually, little broken by submarine mountain ranges, except off volcanic  islands and coasts like those of the Hawaiian (Sandwich) Islands. Off the  latter there are mountains in the sea ranging to as high as 12,000 feet.  The general evenness of the bottom helps to account for the long, sweeping  waves of the Pacific, so distinguishable from the short, cut-up, and  \"choppy\" waves of the Atlantic. In the Atlantic, on the voyage of the  _Challenger_ from Teneriffe to St. Thomas, a pretty level bottom off the  African coast gradually deepened till it reached 3,125 fathoms (over three  and a half miles), at about one-third of the way across to the West  Indies. If the Alps, Mont Blanc and all, were submerged at this spot,  there would still be more than half a mile of water above them! Five  hundred miles further west there is a comparatively shallow part--two miles  or so deep--which afterwards deepens to three miles, and continues at the  same depth nearly as far as the West Indies.          [Illustration: EXAMINING A \"HAUL\" ON BOARD THE \"CHALLENGER.\"]    A few words as to the work laid out for the _Challenger_, and how she did  it. She is a 2,000-ton corvette, of moderate steam-power, and was put into  commission, with a reduced complement of officers and men, Captain (now  Sir) George S. Nares, later the commander of the Arctic expedition, having  complete charge and control. Her work was to include soundings,  thermometric and magnetic observations, dredgings and chemical  examinations of sea-water, the surveying of unsurveyed harbours and  coasts, and the resurveying, where practicable, of partially surveyed  coasts. The (civil) scientific corps, under the charge of Professor  Wyville Thomson, comprised three naturalists, a chemist and physicist, and  a photographer. The naturalists had their special rooms, the chemist his  laboratory, the photographer his \"dark-room,\" and the surveyors their  chart-room, to make room for which all the guns were removed except two.  On the upper deck was another analysing-room, \"devoted to mud, fish,  birds, and vertebrates generally;\" a donkey-engine for hauling in the  sounding, dredging, and other lines, and a broad bridge amidships, from  which the officer for the day gave the necessary orders for the  performance of the many duties connected with their scientific labours.  Thousands of fathoms of rope of all sizes, for dredging and sounding; tons  of sounding-weights, from half to a whole hundredweight apiece; dozens of  thermometers for deep-sea temperatures, and gallons of methylated spirits  for preserving the specimens obtained, were carried on board.                        [Illustration: THE \"ACCUMULATOR.\"]    Steam-power is always very essential to deep-sea sounding. No trustworthy  results can be obtained from a ship under sail; a perpendicular sounding  is the one thing required, and, of course, with steam the vessel can be  kept head to the wind, regulating her speed so that she remains nearly  stationary. The sounding apparatus used needs some little description. A  block was fixed to the main-yard, from which depended the \"accumulator,\"  consisting of strong india-rubber bands, each three-fourths of an inch in  diameter and three feet long, which ran through circular discs of wood at  either end. These are capable of stretching seventeen feet, and their  object is to prevent sudden strain on the lead-line from the inevitable  jerks and motion of the vessel. The sounding-rod used for great depths is,  with its weights,(26) so arranged that on touching bottom a spring  releases a wire sling, and the weights slip off and are left there. These  rods were only employed when the depths were considered to be over 1,500  fathoms; for less depths a long, conical lead weight was used, with a  \"butterfly valve,\" or trap, at its basis for securing specimens from the  ocean bed. There are several kinds of \"slip\" water-bottles for securing  samples of sea-water (and marine objects of small size floating in it) at  great depths. One of the most ingenious is a brass tube, two and a half  feet in length, fitted with easily-working stop-cocks at each end,  connected by means of a rod, on which is a movable float. As the bottle  descends the stop-cocks must remain open, but as it is hauled up again the  flat float receives the opposing pressure of the water above it, and,  acting by means of the connecting-rod, shuts both cocks simultaneously,  thus inclosing a specimen of the water at that particular depth.  Self-registering thermometers were employed, sometimes attached at  intervals of 100 fathoms to the sounding-line, so as to test the  temperatures at various depths. For dredging, bags or nets from three to  five feet in depth, and nine to fifteen inches in width, attached to iron  frames, were employed, whilst at the bottom of the bags a number of  \"swabs,\" similar to those used in cleaning decks, were attached, so as to  sweep along the bottom, and bring up small specimens of animal life--coral,  sponges, &c. These swabs were, however, always termed \"hempen tangles\"--so  much does science dignify every object it touches! The dredges were  afterwards set aside for the ordinary beam-trawls used in shallow water  around our own coasts. Their open meshes allowed the mud and sand to  filter through easily, and their adoption was a source of satisfaction to  some of the officers who looked with horror on the state of their usually  immaculate decks, when the dredges were emptied of their contents.    Not so very long ago, our knowledge of anything beneath the ocean's  surface was extremely indefinite; for even of the coasts and shallows we  knew little, marine zoology and botany being the last, and not the  earliest, branches of natural history investigated by men of science. It  was asserted that the specific gravity of water at great depths would  cause the heaviest weights to remain suspended in mid-sea, and that animal  existence was impossible at the bottom. When, some sixteen years ago, a  few star-fish were brought up by a line from a depth of 1,200 fathoms, it  was seriously considered that they had attached themselves at some midway  point, and not at the bottom. In 1868-9-70, the Royal Society borrowed  from the Admiralty two of Her Majesty's vessels, the _Lightning_ and  _Porcupine_; and in one of the latter's trips, considerably to the south  and west of Ireland, she sounded to a depth of 2,400 fathoms,(27) and was  very successful in many dredging operations. As a result, it was then  suggested that a vessel should be specially fitted out for a more  important ocean voyage round the world, to occupy three or more years, and  the cruise of the _Challenger_ was then determined upon.    The story of that cruise is utterly unsensational; it is one simply of  calm and unremitting scientific work, almost unaccompanied by peril. To  some the treasures acquired will seem valueless. Among the earliest gains,  obtained near Cape St. Vincent, with a common trawl, was a beautiful  specimen of the Euplectella, \"glass-rope sponge,\" or \"Venus's  flower-basket,\" alive. This object of beauty and interest, sometimes seen  in working naturalists' and conchologists' windows in London, had always  previously been obtained from the seas of the Philippine Islands and  Japan, to which it was thought to be confined, and its discovery so much  nearer home was hailed with delight. It has a most graceful form,  consisting of a slightly curved conical tube, eight or ten inches in  height, contracted beneath to a blunt point. The walls are of light  tracery, resembling opaque spun glass, covered with a lace-work of  delicate pattern. The lower end is surrounded by an upturned fringe of  lustrous fibres, and the wider end is closed by a lid of open network.  These beautiful objects of nature make most charming ornaments for a  drawing-room, but have to be kept under a glass case, as they are somewhat  frail. In their native element they lie buried in the mud. They were  afterwards found to be \"the most characteristic inhabitants of the great  depths all over the world.\" Early in the voyage, no lack of living things  were brought up--strange-looking fish, with their eyes blown nearly out of  their heads by the expansion of the air in their air-bladders, whilst  entangled among the meshes were many star-fish and delicate zoophytes,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#11)"],[1,"Victoria on January 18, when water on the floor of the cave was  frozen; the bats were congregated on the ceiling at a height of 20  feet. In a cave in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, 16 miles west and three  miles south of Piedra, females and young were found some 50 yards from  the entrance; _Natalus stramineus_ and _Glossophaga soricina_ were  obtained from the same cave. In another cave only half a kilometer  distant, 12 males were collected. In Cueva La Mula, _Desmodus_ was  found near the mouth, whereas _Choeronycteris mexicana_ and two  _Tadarida brasiliensis_ were collected in the deepest part. At Cueva La  Esperanza, 300 feet deep and on the east side of the Sierra Madre  Oriental, four different congregations of vampires were found along  with about 400 _Natalus_. A male _Desmodus_ obtained in a cave 13 miles  west and six and a half miles north of Jimenez also was associated with  _Natalus_.    Females with embryos or in lactation were collected as follows: Rancho  Pano Ayuctle, March 10, one pregnant female (embryo 40 mm. in  crown-rump length); Rio Sabinas, May 23, two pregnant females (embryos  36 and 43 mm.); Sierra de Tamaulipas, June 13, five lactating females  and one female taken alive that gave birth on June 16 to one young;  Cueva La Mula, August, nine lactating females.

Mus. Argentino       Cien. Nat., 4:94, March 27, 1958).         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southern and central parts of       state.    The hairy-legged vampire was first reported from Tamaulipas by de la  Torre (1954:114), who recorded a male from five miles northeast of  Antiguo Morelos, near El Pachon. Later in the same year Martin and  Martin (1954:585) listed another male from El Pachon. Subsequently,  Malaga and Villa (1957:543) reported specimens from two additional  localities in the state, one of which (Cueva de la Sepultura) provides  the northernmost place from which the species has been recorded. Malaga  and Villa remarked that the species was abundant at Cueva de la  Sepultura, being found in small groups clinging to the roof of the  cave. Two females taken there on November 11 carried one embryo each; a  lactating female was taken on November 14. The vampire, _Desmodus  rotundus_, also was taken at Cueva de la Sepultura.    I follow Burt and Stirton (1961:37) in treating _Diphylla ecaudata_ as  a monotypic species.         _Records_: Cueva de la Sepultura, 7.5 km. NNW and hence 7       km. SSW (_via_ highway) Cd.

Novit., 1977:7, December 22.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Central and southwestern       parts of state.    All specimens examined were obtained from caves. At Cueva la Esperanza,  approximately 400 individuals were found along with individuals of  _Desmodus rotundus_; _Natalus_ and _Desmodus_ also were collected  together in a cave approximately 30 yards deep three miles south and 14  miles west of Piedra, and in a cave six and a half miles north and 13  miles west of Jimenez, the northernmost locality from which _N.  stramineus_ is presently known.    Tamaulipan specimens do not differ significantly in external or cranial  measurements in comparison with the specimens from Veracruz reported by  Dalquest and Hall (1949:154), but do differ in color. Most are in the  gray phase and are Avellaneus (grayish with yellowish hairs mixed)  instead of Clay Color as are specimens from Veracruz; those few in the  red phase are between Clay Color and Tawny-Olive instead of between  Burnt Sienna and Chestnut. By consequence, bats from Tamaulipas  resemble in color the smaller _N. s. mexicanus_ of western Mexico to a  greater degree than they resemble _N. s. saturatus_, but I follow  Goodwin (1959:7).    Dalquest and Hall (1949:154) reported the specimen from eight  kilometers northeast of Antiguo Morelos as from San Luis Potosi, from  which state the collector (Dalquest) evidently thought it had  originated. Actually the place eight kilometers northeast of Antiguo  Morelos is in Tamaulipas.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 64: 6.5 mi. N,       13 mi.

Mus., 144:92, May 25.         _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably most of northern       part of state; presently known only from three localities.    The two specimens examined from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were taken in  a mist net in which _Eptesicus fuscus_, _Myotis keenii_, and _Tadarida  brasiliensis_ also were captured. Both are females, one of which was  lactating (June 20). Specimens from San Fernando probably were taken in  houses by natives, who brought the bats to the collectors (Clifton and  Bodley). The maxillary tooth-row and tibia are shorter, breadth across  M3 narrower, and ear slightly longer in Tamaulipan specimens than in  those for which measurements were given by Miller and Allen (1928:95),  but the Tamaulipan specimens do not differ otherwise. The color in  general is slightly more brownish than in Texan _incautus_, but about  as in Oklahoman specimens examined. Three from San Fernando,  Tamaulipas, are darker than others from that state.    The average weight of 12 non-pregnant females from San Fernando was  11.0 (9.5-13) grams. The only male obtained at the same locality  weighed 12 grams.         _Measurements._--Six females from San Fernando afford the       following measurements: 100.0 (95-107); 42.5 (38-46); 10.3       (10-11); 15.3 (14.5-16); length of tibia, 17.4 (16.5-18.9);       length of forearm, 44.8 (43.4-45.7); greatest length of       skull, 16.5 (16.1-16.9); condylobasal length, 15.6       (15.3-15.8); least interorbital constriction, 4.0 (3.9-4.1);       mastoid breadth, 8.3 (8.1-8.6); length of maxillary       tooth-row, 6.5 (6.3-6.7); breadth across M3, 6.5 (6.0-6.9).         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15: San       Fernando, 180 ft., 13; Sierra de Tamaulipas, 10 mi.

The two specimens known from Tamaulipas were caught in a mist net  stretched across a narrow, brush-bordered arroyo in the Sierra de  Tamaulipas. I tentatively follow Findley (1960) in arranging  _auriculus_ as a subspecies of _M. keenii_.         _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, the holotype       and one topotype.      =Myotis californicus mexicanus= (Saussure)    California Myotis         1890. _V[espertilio]. mexicanus_ Saussure, Revue et Mag.
