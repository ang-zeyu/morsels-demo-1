[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#11)"],[1," and as for  Sancho, though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him,  unless it be a sort of dog-like affection for his master, who is there  that in his heart does not love him?    But it is, after all, the humour of \"Don Quixote\" that distinguishes it  from all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as  one of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, \"the best  novel in the world beyond all comparison.\" It is its varied humour,  ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare's or  Moliere's that has naturalised it in every country where there are  readers, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.    SOME COMMENDATORY VERSES      URGANDA THE UNKNOWN    To the book of Don Quixote of la Mancha     If to be welcomed by the good,     O Book! thou make thy steady aim,   No empty chatterer will dare     To question or dispute thy claim.   But if perchance thou hast a mind     To win of idiots approbation,   Lost labour will be thy reward,     Though they'll pretend appreciation.     They say a goodly shade he finds     Who shelters 'neath a goodly tree;   And such a one thy kindly star     In Bejar bath provided thee:   A royal tree whose spreading boughs     A show of princely fruit display;   A tree that bears a noble Duke,     The Alexander of his day.     Of a Manchegan gentleman     Thy purpose is to tell the story,   Relating how he lost his wits     O'er idle tales of love and glory,   Of \"ladies, arms, and cavaliers:\"     A new Orlando Furioso-   Innamorato, rather--who     Won Dulcinea del Toboso.     Put no vain emblems on thy shield;     All figures--that is bragging play.   A modest dedication make,     And give no scoffer room to say,   \"What! Alvaro de Luna here?     Or is it Hannibal again?   Or does King Francis at Madrid     Once more of destiny complain?\"     Since Heaven it hath not pleased on thee     Deep erudition to bestow,   Or black Latino's gift of tongues,     No Latin let thy pages show.   Ape not philosophy or wit,     Lest one who cannot comprehend,   Make a wry face at thee and ask,     \"Why offer flowers to me, my friend?\"     Be not a meddler; no affair     Of thine the life thy neighbours lead:   Be prudent; oft the random jest     Recoils upon the jester's head.   Thy constant labour let it be     To earn thyself an honest name,   For fooleries preserved in print     Are perpetuity of shame.     A further counsel bear in mind:     If that thy roof be made of glass,   It shows small wit to pick up stones     To pelt the people as they pass.   Win the attention of the wise,     And give the thinker food for thought;   Whoso indites frivolities,     Will but by simpletons be sought.                       AMADIS OF GAUL         To Don Quixote of la Mancha    SONNET     Thou that didst imitate that life of mine     When I in lonely sadness on the great     Rock Pena Pobre sat disconsolate,   In self-imposed penance there to pine;   Thou, whose sole beverage was the bitter brine     Of thine own tears, and who withouten plate     Of silver, copper, tin, in lowly state   Off the bare earth and on earth's fruits didst dine;   Live thou, of thine eternal glory sure.     So long as on the round of the fourth sphere     The bright Apollo shall his coursers steer,   In thy renown thou shalt remain secure,   Thy country's name in story shall endure,     And thy sage author stand without a peer.          DON BELIANIS OF GREECE  To Don Quixote of la Mancha    SONNET     In slashing, hewing, cleaving, word and deed,     I was the foremost knight of chivalry,     Stout, bold, expert, as e'er the world did see;   Thousands from the oppressor's wrong I freed;   Great were my feats, eternal fame their meed;     In love I proved my truth and loyalty;     The hugest giant was a dwarf for me;   Ever to knighthood's laws gave I good heed.   My mastery the Fickle Goddess owned,     And even Chance, submitting to control,       Grasped by the forelock, yielded to my will.   Yet--though above yon horned moon enthroned       My fortune seems to sit--great Quixote, still     Envy of thy achievements fills my soul.          THE LADY OF ORIANA  To Dulcinea del Toboso    SONNET     Oh, fairest Dulcinea, could it be!     It were a pleasant fancy to suppose so--     Could Miraflores change to El Toboso,   And London's town to that which shelters thee!   Oh, could mine but acquire that livery     Of countless charms thy mind and body show so!     Or him, now famous grown--thou mad'st him grow so--   Thy knight, in some dread combat could I see!   Oh, could I be released from Amadis     By exercise of such coy chastity   As led thee gentle Quixote to dismiss!       Then would my heavy sorrow turn to joy;     None would I envy, all would envy me,       And happiness be mine without alloy.    GANDALIN, SQUIRE OF AMADIS OF GAUL,  To Sancho Panza, squire of Don Quixote    SONNET     All hail, illustrious man! Fortune, when she     Bound thee apprentice to the esquire trade,     Her care and tenderness of thee displayed,   Shaping thy course from misadventure free.   No longer now doth proud knight-errantry     Regard with scorn the sickle and the spade;     Of towering arrogance less count is made   Than of plain esquire-like simplicity.   I envy thee thy Dapple, and thy name,     And those alforjas thou wast wont to stuff   With comforts that thy providence proclaim.       Excellent Sancho! hail to thee again!       To thee alone the Ovid of our Spain     Does homage with the rustic kiss and cuff.             FROM EL DONOSO, THE MOTLEY POET,    On Sancho Panza and Rocinante    ON SANCHO    I am the esquire Sancho Pan--  Who served Don Quixote of La Man--;  But from his service I retreat-,  Resolved to pass my life discreet-;  For Villadiego, called the Si--,  Maintained that only in reti--  Was found the secret of well-be--,  According to the \"Celesti--:\"  A book divine, except for sin--  By speech too plain, in my opin--    ON ROCINANTE    I am that Rocinante fa--,  Great-grandson of great Babie--,  Who, all for being lean and bon--,  Had one Don Quixote for an own--;  But if I matched him well in weak--,  I never took short commons meek--,  But kept myself in corn by steal--,  A trick I learned from Lazaril--,  When with a piece of straw so neat--  The blind man of his wine he cheat--.    ORLANDO FURIOSO  To Don Quixote of La Mancha    SONNET     If thou art not a Peer, peer thou hast none;     Among a thousand Peers thou art a peer;     Nor is there room for one when thou art near,   Unvanquished victor, great unconquered one!   Orlando, by Angelica undone,     Am I; o'er distant seas condemned to steer,     And to Fame's altars as an offering bear   Valour respected by Oblivion.   I cannot be thy rival, for thy fame     And prowess rise above all rivalry,       Albeit both bereft of wits we go.   But, though the Scythian or the Moor to tame     Was not thy lot, still thou dost rival me:      Love binds us in a fellowship of woe.          THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUS    To Don Quixote of La Mancha     My sword was not to be compared with thine     Phoebus of Spain, marvel of courtesy,   Nor with thy famous arm this hand of mine     That smote from east to west as lightnings fly.     I scorned all empire, and that monarchy   The rosy east held out did I resign     For one glance of Claridiana's eye,   The bright Aurora for whose love I pine.   A miracle of constancy my love;     And banished by her ruthless cruelty,       This arm had might the rage of Hell to tame.   But, Gothic Quixote, happier thou dost prove,       For thou dost live in Dulcinea's name,     And famous, honoured, wise, she lives in thee.          FROM SOLISDAN  To Don Quixote of La Mancha    SONNET     Your fantasies, Sir Quixote, it is true,     That crazy brain of yours have quite upset,     But aught of base or mean hath never yet   Been charged by any in reproach to you.   Your deeds are open proof in all men's view;     For you went forth injustice to abate,     And for your pains sore drubbings did you get   From many a rascally and ruffian crew.   If the fair Dulcinea, your heart's queen,     Be unrelenting in her cruelty,       If still your woe be powerless to move her,     In such hard case your comfort let it be   That Sancho was a sorry go-between:       A booby he, hard-hearted she, and you no lover.    DIALOGUE  Between Babieca and Rocinante    SONNET    B.  \"How comes it, Rocinante, you're so lean?\"  R.  \"I'm underfed, with overwork I'm worn.\"  B.  \"But what becomes of all the hay and corn?\"  R.  \"My master gives me none; he's much too mean.\"  B.  \"Come, come, you show ill-breeding, sir, I ween;    'T is like an ass your master thus to scorn.\"  R.  He is an ass, will die an ass, an ass was born;    Why, he's in love; what's what's plainer to be seen?\"  B.  \"To be in love is folly?\"--R. \"No great sense.\"  B.  \"You're metaphysical.\"--R. \"From want of food.\"  B.  \"Rail at the squire, then.\"--R. \"Why, what's the good?      I might indeed complain of him, I grant ye,    But, squire or master, where's the difference?      They're both as sorry hacks as Rocinante.\"          THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE    Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this  book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and  cleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature's law  that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile,  illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical  offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any  other imagination--just what might be begotten in a prison, where every  misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?  Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies,  murmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make  even the most barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5946"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 2, Complete (#11)"],[1,"and a fearless heart,  and, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though they have for  armour the shells of a certain fish, that they say are harder than  diamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of Damascus  steel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I have more  than once seen. All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see the  difference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and it  would be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on  this second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant;  for, as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who  have been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.\"    \"Ah, senor,\" here exclaimed the niece, \"remember that all this you are  saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories, if  indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have a  sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known as infamous  and a corrupter of good manners.\"    \"By the God that gives me life,\" said Don Quixote, \"if thou wert not my  full niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would inflict a  chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the  world should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that hardly  knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and  criticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Senor Amadis say if  he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee, for  he was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, and  moreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might have  heard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; for  they are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned  scoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is so  in all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like  gentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men  of low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and  high gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low  rank; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues,  the latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices;  and one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two  kinds of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.\"    \"God bless me!\" said the niece, \"that you should know so much,  uncle--enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the  streets--and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a  folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are  old, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is crooked  when you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero when you  are not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are nothing of the  kind!\"    \"There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,\" returned Don  Quixote, \"and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish  you; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I refrain. Look you, my  dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what I am saying) can be  reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had humble beginnings,  and went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained  surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and maintained  them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin; those,  again, that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid,  having reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to  nought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively to its base or  foundation, is nothing; and then there are those--and it is they that are  the most numerous--that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a  remarkable mid-course, and so will have an end without a name, like an  ordinary plebeian line. Of the first, those that had an humble origin and  rose to the greatness they still preserve, the Ottoman house may serve as  an example, which from an humble and lowly shepherd, its founder, has  reached the height at which we now see it. For examples of the second  sort of lineage, that began with greatness and maintains it still without  adding to it, there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity,  and maintain themselves in their inheritance, without increasing or  diminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limits of their states. Of  those that began great and ended in a point, there are thousands of  examples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the Caesars of  Rome, and the whole herd (if I may apply such a word to them) of countless  princes, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and  barbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and  come to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would  be impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we  find one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeian  lineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the  number of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to any  fame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you gather,  my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and that  only those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so  by the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors. I have said  virtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will  be a great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be  merely a miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by  possessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he pleases, but  by knowing how to spend it well. The poor gentleman has no way of showing  that he is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred,  courteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, or  censorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis given  with a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as he  who distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to  be endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he know him not,  will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it  would be strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of  virtue, and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation.  There are two roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and  honours; one is that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of  arms than of letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to  arms, was born under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore,  in a measure constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in  spite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me  to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above  all, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils  that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite  blessings that are attained by it; I know that the path of virtue is very  narrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and  goals are different, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death,  and the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory  life, but in that which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet  says, that--    It is by rugged paths like these they go  That scale the heights of immortality,  Unreached by those that falter here below.\"    \"Woe is me!\" exclaimed the niece, \"my lord is a poet, too! He knows  everything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he chose to turn  mason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.\"    \"I can tell you, niece,\" replied Don Quixote, \"if these chivalrous  thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that I  could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my  hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.\"    At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who  was there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the  housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see  him; in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his  master Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the  pair shut themselves up in his room, where they had another conversation  not inferior to the previous one.          CHAPTER VII.    OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER  VERY NOTABLE INCIDENTS      The instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her  master, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the result  of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, she  seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find the  bachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man,  and a new friend of her master's, he might be able to persuade him to  give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the patio of his  house, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment she  saw him.    Carrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her, \"What  is this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One would think  you heart-broken.\"    \"Nothing, Senor Samson,\" said she, \"only that my master is breaking out,  plainly breaking out.\"    \"Whereabouts is he breaking out, senora?\" asked Samson; \"has any part of  his body burst?\"    \"He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,\" she replied; \"I  mean, dear senor bachelor, that he is going to break out again (and this  will be the third time) to hunt all over the world "]]]
