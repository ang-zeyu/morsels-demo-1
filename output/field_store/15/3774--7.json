The {xxx} account which we received from them was full, clear, and  unreserved, and the sum of it was to the following purport:    When the vessels arrived at this place (Marble Island) it was very late  in the Fall, and in getting them into the harbour, the largest received  much damage; but on being fairly in, the English began to build the  house, their number at that time seeming to be about fifty. As soon as  the ice permitted, in the following Summer, (one thousand seven hundred  and twenty), the Esquimaux paid them another visit, by which time the  number of the English was greatly reduced, and those that were living  seemed very unhealthy. According to the account given by the Esquimaux  they were then very busily employed, but about what they could not  easily describe, probably in lengthening the long-boat; for at a little  distance from the house there is now lying a great quantity of oak  chips, which have been most assuredly made by carpenters.    Sickness and famine occasioned such havock among the English, that by  the setting in of the second Winter their number was reduced to twenty.  That Winter (one thousand seven hundred and twenty) some of the  Esquimaux took up their abode on the opposite side of the harbour to  that on which the English had built their houses,[E] and {xxxi}  frequently supplied them with such provisions as they had, which chiefly  consisted of whale's blubber and seal's flesh and train oil. When the  Spring advanced, the Esquimaux went to the continent, and on their  visiting Marble Island again, in the Summer of one thousand seven  hundred and twenty-one, they only found five of the English alive, and  those were in such distress for provisions that they eagerly eat the  seal's flesh and whale's blubber quite raw, as they purchased it from  the natives. This disordered them so much, that three of them died in a  few days, and the other two, though very weak, made a shift to bury  them. Those two survived many days after the rest, and frequently went  to the top of an adjacent rock, and earnestly looked to the South and  East, as if in expectation of some vessels coming to their relief. After  continuing there a considerable time together, and nothing appearing in  sight, they sat down close together, and wept bitterly. At length one of  the two died, and the other's strength was so far exhausted, that he  fell down and died also, in attempting to dig a grave for his companion.  The {xxxii} sculls and other large bones of those two men are now lying  above-ground close to the house. The longest liver was, according to the  Esquimaux account, always employed in working of iron into implements  for them; probably he was the armourer, or smith.    Some Northern Indians who came to trade at Prince of Wales's Fort in the  Spring of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight, brought  farther accounts of the grand river, as it was called, and also several  pieces of copper, as samples of the produce of the mine near it; which  determined Mr. Norton, who was then Governor at Churchill, to represent  it to the Company as an affair worthy of their attention; and as he went  that year to England, he had an opportunity of laying all the  information he had received before the Board, with his opinion thereon,  and the plan which he thought most likely to succeed in the discovery of  those mines. In consequence of Mr. Norton's representations, the  Committee resolved to send an intelligent person by land to observe the  longitude and latitude of the river's mouth, to make a chart of the  country he might walk through, with such remarks as occurred to him  during the Journey; when I was pitched on as a proper person to conduct  the expedition. By the ship that went to Churchill in the Summer of one  thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine, the Company sent out some  astronomical instruments, very portable, and fit for such observations  as they required me {xxxiii} to make, and at the same time requested me  to undertake the Journey, promising to allow me at my return, a gratuity  proportionable to the trouble and fatigue I might undergo in the  expedition.[F]    {xxxiv} I did not hesitate to comply with the request of the Company,  and in the November following, when some Northern Indians came to trade,  Mr. Norton, who was then returned to the command of Prince of Wales's  Fort, engaged such of them for my guides as he thought were most likely  to answer the purpose; but none of them had been at this grand river. I  was fitted out with everything thought necessary, and with ammunition to  serve two years. I was to be accompanied by two of the Company's  servants, two of the Home-guard[G] (Southern) Indians, {xxxv} and a  sufficient number of Northern Indians to carry and haul my baggage,  provide for me, &c. But for the better stating this arrangement, it will  not be improper to insert my Instructions, which, with some occasional  remarks thereon, will throw much light on the following Journal, and be  the best method of proving how far those orders have been complied with,  as well as shew my reasons for neglecting some parts as unnecessary, and  the impossibility of putting other parts of them in execution.        \"ORDERS _and_ INSTRUCTIONS _for_ Mr. SAMUEL HEARNE, _going on an      Expedition by Land towards the Latitude 70 deg. North, in order to      gain a Knowledge of the Northern Indians Country, &c. on Behalf      of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, in the Year 1769_.        \"Mr. SAMUEL HEARNE,        \"SIR,        \"Whereas the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company have been informed      by the report from Indians, that there is a great probability of      considerable advantages to be expected from a better knowledge      of their country by us, than what hitherto has been obtained;      and as it is the Company's earnest desire to embrace every      circumstance that may tend to the benefit of the said Company,      or the Nation at large, they have requested you to conduct this      Expedition; and as you {xxxvi} have readily consented to      undertake the present Journey, you are hereby desired to proceed      as soon as possible, with William Isbester sailor, and Thomas      Merriman landsman, as companions, they both being willing to      accompany you; also two of the Home-guard Southern Indians, who      are to attend and assist you during the Journey; and Captain      Chawchinahaw, his Lieutenant Nabyah, and six or eight of the      best Northern Indians we can procure, with a small part of their      families, are to conduct you, provide for you, and assist you      and your companions in every thing that lays in their power,      having particular orders so to do.        \"2dly, Whereas you and your companions are well fitted-out with      every thing we think necessary, as also a sample of light      trading goods; these you are to dispose of by way of presents      (and not by way of trade) to such far-off Indians as you may      meet with, and to smoke your Calimut[H] of Peace with their      leaders, in order to establish a friendship with them. You are      also to persuade them as much as possible from going to war with      each other, to encourage them to exert themselves in procuring      furrs and other articles for trade, and to assure them of good      payment for them at the Company's Factory.        \"It is sincerely recommended to you and your companions to treat      the natives with civility, so as not to give {xxxvii} them any      room for complaint or disgust, as they have strict orders not to      give you the least offence, but are to aid and assist you in any      matter you may request of them for the benefit of the      undertaking.        \"If any Indians you may meet, that are coming to the Fort,      should be willing to trust you with either food or clothing,      make your agreement for those commodities, and by them send me a      letter, specifying the quantity of each article, and they shall      be paid according to your agreement. And, according to the      Company's orders, you are to correspond with me, or the Chief at      Prince of Wales's Fort for the time being, at all opportunities:      And as you have mathematical instruments with you, you are to      send me, or the Chief for the time being, an account of what      latitude and longitude you may be in at such and such periods,      together with the heads of your proceedings; which accounts are      to be remitted to the Company by the return of their ships.[I]        \"3dly, The Indians who are now appointed your guides, are to      conduct you to the borders of the Athapuscow[J] Indians country,      where Captain Matonabbee {xxxviii} is to meet you[K] in the      Spring of one thousand seven hundred and seventy, in order to      conduct you to a river represented by the Indians to abound with      copper ore, animals of the furr kind, &c., and which is said to      be so far to the Northward, that in the middle of the Summer the      Sun does not set, and is supposed by the Indians to empty itself      into some ocean.

While waiting for the order to attack, a clever reconnoissance was made by  Colonels Terry and Lubbock, Texans, on the brigade staff, which disclosed  the march of the heavy columns of the Federals towards our left. Their  report was sent promptly to head-quarters, and after a short delay the  brigade was ordered back to its position behind the Run.    Tyler's division moved early on the 21st towards the Stone Bridge. The  march was not rapid, but timely. His first shells went tearing through the  elements over the heads of the Confederates before six o'clock. The Second  and Third Divisions followed his column till its rear cleared the road  leading up to the ford at Sudley Springs, when they filed off on that  route. McDowell was with them, and saw them file off on their course, and  followed their march. His Fifth Division and Richardson's brigade of the  First were left in reserve at Centreville, and the Fourth Division was  left in a position rearward of them. The march of the columns over the  single track of the farm road leading up to Sudley Springs was not only  fatiguing, but so prolonged the diversion of Tyler's division at the  bridge as to expose its real intent, and cause his adversary to look  elsewhere for the important work. Viewing the zone of operations as far as  covered by the eye, Evans discovered a column of dust rising above the  forest in the vicinity of Sudley Springs. This, with the busy delay of  Tyler in front of the bridge, exposed the plans, and told of another  quarter for the approaching battle; when Evans, leaving four companies of  infantry and two pieces of artillery to defend the bridge, moved with the  rest of his command to meet the approaching columns off his left. Bearing  in mind his care of the bridge, it was necessary to occupy grounds north  of the pike. The position chosen was the plateau near the Matthews House,  about a thousand yards north of the pike, and about the same distance from  Bull Run, commanding the road by which the turning divisions of the enemy  were to approach. His artillery (two six-pound guns) was posted to his  right and left, somewhat retired. Meanwhile, Tyler's batteries maintained  their position at and below the Stone Bridge, as did those near the lower  fords. McDowell's column crossed at Sudley's Ford at nine o'clock, and  approached Evans a few minutes before ten. The leading division under  Hunter, finding Evans's command across its route, advanced the Second  Rhode Island Regiment and battery of six guns of Burnside's brigade to  open the way. Evans's infantry and artillery met the advance, and after a  severe fight drove it back[5] to the line of woodland, when Burnside,  reinforced by his other three regiments, with them advanced eight guns.  This attack was much more formidable, and pressed an hour or more before  our forces retired to the woodland. The fight, though slackened,  continued, while the brigade under Porter advanced to Burnside's support.    Waiting some time to witness the opening of his aggressive fight towards  Centreville, Beauregard found at last that his battle order had  miscarried. While yet in doubt as to the cause of delay, his attention was  drawn to the fight opened by McDowell against Evans. This affair,  increasing in volume, drew him away from his original point and object of  observation. He reconsidered the order to attack at Centreville, and rode  for the field just opening to severe work. The brigades of Bee and  Bartow,--commanded by Bee,--and Jackson's, had been drawn towards the  left, the former two near Cocke's position, and Jackson from the right to  the left of Mitchell's Ford. They were to await orders, but were  instructed, and intrusted, in the absence of orders, to seek the place  where the fight was thickest. About twelve o'clock that splendid soldier,  Bernard E. Bee, under orders to find the point of danger, construed it  as calling him to Evans's support, and marched, without other notice than  the noise of increasing battle, with his own and Bartow's brigades and  Imboden's battery. The move against the enemy's reserve at Centreville  suspended, Colonels Terry and Lubbock, volunteer aides, crossed the Run to  make another reconnoissance of the positions about Centreville. Captain  Goree, of Texas, and Captain Sorrel, of Georgia, had also joined the  brigade staff. As Bee approached Evans he formed line upon the plateau at  the Henry House, suggesting to Evans to withdraw to that as a better field  than the advance ground held by the latter; but in deference to Evans's  care for the bridge, which involved care for the turnpike, Bee yielded,  and ordered his troops to join Evans's advance. Imboden's artillery,  however, failed to respond, remaining on the Henry plateau; leaving Bee  and Evans with two six-pounder smoothbore guns to combat the enemy's  formidable batteries of eight to twelve guns of superior metal, as well as  the accumulating superior infantry forces, Imboden's battery making a show  of practice with six-pounders at great range. The infantry crossed Young's  Branch under severe fire, and were posted on the line of Evans's battle.      [Illustration: Thos. J. Goree. Captain and Aide-de-Camp.]      Burnside was reinforced by Porter's brigade, and afterwards by a part of  Heintzelman's division. Ricketts's battery, and subsequently the battery  under Griffin, pressed their fight with renewed vigor. The batteries,  particularly active and aggressive, poured incessant fire upon the  Confederate ranks, who had no artillery to engage against them except  Imboden's, far off to the rear, and the section of Latham's howitzers. The  efforts of the Federal infantry were cleverly met and resisted, but the  havoc of those splendid batteries was too severe, particularly Griffin's,  that had an oblique fire upon the Confederates. It was the fire of this  battery that first disturbed our ranks on their left, and the increasing  pounding of that and Ricketts's eventually unsettled the line. At this  juncture two brigades of Tyler's division, with General W. T. Sherman and  General Keyes, crossed the Run at a ford some distance above the bridge  and approached the Confederate right, making more unsettled their  position. At the same time the attacking artillery and infantry followed  up their opportunity in admirable style, pushed the Confederates back, and  pursued down to the valley of Young's Branch.    At one P.M., Colonels Terry and Lubbock returned from their reconnoissance  of the ground in front of Centreville, with a diagram showing points of  the Union lines and troops there posted. I sent it up to head-quarters,  suggesting that the brigades at the lower fords be put across the Run, and  advance against the reserves as designed by the order of the morning.  Colonel Terry returned with the suggestion approved, and we communicated  the same to the brigades at McLean's and Union Mills Fords, commanded by  officers of senior dates to myself. The brigades were prepared, however,  for concert of action. Bee, Bartow, and Evans made valorous efforts, while  withdrawing from their struggle on the Matthews plateau, to maintain the  integrity of their lines, and with some success, when General Wade Hampton  came with his brigade to their aid, checked the progress of pursuit, and  helped to lift their broken ranks to the plateau at the Henry House. The  fight assumed proportions which called for the care of both General  Johnston and General Beauregard, who, with the movements of their right  too late to relieve the pressure of the left, found it necessary to draw  their forces to the point at which the battle had been forced by the  enemy. At the same time the reserve brigades of their right were called to  the left. General Thomas J. Jackson also moved to that quarter, and  reached the rear crest of the plateau at the Henry House while yet Bee,  Bartow, Evans, and Hampton were climbing to the forward crest. Quick to  note a proper ground, Jackson deployed on the crest at the height, leaving  the open of the plateau in front. He was in time to secure the Imboden  battery before it got off the field, and put it into action. Stanard's  battery, Pendleton's, and Pelham's, and part of the Washington Artillery  were up in time to aid Jackson in his new formation and relieve our  discomfited troops rallying on his flank. As they rose on the forward  crest, Bee saw, on the farther side, Jackson's line, serene as if in  repose, affording a haven so promising of cover that he gave the  christening of \"Stonewall\" for the immortal Jackson.    \"There,\" said he, \"is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.\"    General Johnston and General Beauregard reached the field, and busied  themselves in getting the troops together and in lines of defence. Other  reinforcements were ordered from the right, including the reserve brigades  at McLean's and Union Mills Fords, and a number of batteries. Bee and  Evans reformed their lines upon Jackson's. After permitting Burnside's  brigade to retire for rest, McDowell pushed his battle by his strong  artillery arm, advancing against and turning the Confederate left, only  giving some little time to select positions for his batteries to plunge  more effective fire into the Confederate ranks. This time, so necessary  for McDowell's renewal, was as important to the Confederates in getting  their reinforcements of infantry and artillery in position, and proved of  even greater value in lengthening out the fight, so as to give Kirby Smith  and Elzey, just off the train from the Shenandoah Valley, time to appear  at the last moment.    After arranging the new position of the troops about Jackson, General  Johnston rode back to the Lewis House, where he could better comprehend  the entire field, leaving Beauregard in charge of the troops engaged on  his left. McDowell gave especial care to preparing his batteries for"]]]
