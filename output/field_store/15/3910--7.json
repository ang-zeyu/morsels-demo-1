I'm not interested in  Charlotte's correspondence, goodness knows.  But if Jane had  anything in particular to write about she should have written to  ME.  I am the oldest.  Charlotte had no business to get a letter  from Jane Roberts without consulting me.  It's just like her  underhanded ways.  She got married the same way.  Never said a  word to me about it, but just sneaked off with that unprincipled  Jacob Wheeler--\"    \"Mrs. Roberts is very ill. I understand,\" persisted Mr.  Patterson, nobly resolved to do what he had come to do, \"dying,  in fact, and--\"    \"Jane ill!  Jane dying!\" exclaimed Miss Rosetta.  \"Why, she was  the healthiest girl I ever knew!  But then I've never seen her,  nor heard from her, since she got married fifteen years ago.  I  dare say her husband was a brute and neglected her, and she's  pined away by slow degrees.  I've no faith in husbands.  Look at  Charlotte!  Everybody knows how Jacob Wheeler used her.  To be  sure, she deserved it, but--\"    \"Mrs. Roberts' husband is dead,\" said Mr. Patterson.  \"Died about  two months ago, I understand, and she has a little baby six  months old, and she thought perhaps Mrs. Wheeler would take it  for old times' sake--\"    \"Did Charlotte ask you to call and tell me this?\" demanded Miss  Rosetta eagerly.    \"No; she just told me what was in the letter.  She didn't mention  you; but I thought, perhaps, you ought to be told--\"    \"I knew it,\" said Miss Rosetta in a tone of bitter assurance.  \"I  could have told you so.  Charlotte wouldn't even let me know that  Jane was ill.  Charlotte would be afraid I would want to get the  baby, seeing that Jane and I were such intimate friends long ago.  And who has a better right to it than me, I should like to know?  Ain't I the oldest?  And haven't I had experience in bringing up  babies?  Charlotte needn't think she is going to run the affairs  of our family just because she happened to get married.  Jacob  Wheeler--\"    \"I must be going,\" said Mr. Patterson, gathering up his reins  thankfully.    \"I am much obliged to you for coming to tell me about Jane,\" said  Miss Rosetta, \"even though you have wasted a lot of precious time  getting it out.  If it hadn't been for you I suppose I should  never have known it at all.  As it is, I shall start for town  just as soon as I can get ready.\"    \"You'll have to hurry if you want to get ahead of Mrs. Wheeler,\"  advised Mr. Patterson.  \"She's packing her trunk and going on  the morning train.\"    \"I'll pack a valise and go on the afternoon train,\" retorted Miss  Rosetta triumphantly.  \"I'll show Charlotte she isn't running the  Ellis affairs.  She married out of them into the Wheelers.  She  can attend to them.  Jacob Wheeler was the most--\"    But Mr. Patterson had driven away.  He felt that he had done his  duty in the face of fearful odds, and he did not want to hear  anything more about Jacob Wheeler.    Rosetta Ellis and Charlotte Wheeler had not exchanged a word for  ten years.  Before that time they had been devoted to each other,  living together in the little Ellis cottage on the White Sands  road, as they had done ever since their parents' death.  The  trouble began when Jacob Wheeler had commenced to pay attention  to Charlotte, the younger and prettier of two women who had both  ceased to be either very young or very pretty.  Rosetta had been  bitterly opposed to the match from the first.  She vowed she had  no use for Jacob Wheeler.  There were not lacking malicious  people to hint that this was because the aforesaid Jacob Wheeler  had selected the wrong sister upon whom to bestow his affections.  Be that as it might, Miss Rosetta certainly continued to render  the course of Jacob Wheeler's true love exceedingly rough and  tumultuous.  The end of it was that Charlotte had gone quietly  away one morning and married Jacob Wheeler without Miss Rosetta's  knowing anything about it.  Miss Rosetta had never forgiven her  for it, and Charlotte had never forgiven the things Rosetta had  said to her when she and Jacob returned to the Ellis cottage.  Since then the sisters had been avowed and open foes, the only  difference being that Miss Rosetta aired her grievances publicly,  in season and out of season, while Charlotte was never heard to  mention Rosetta's name.  Even the death of Jacob Wheeler, five  years after the marriage, had not healed the breach.    Miss Rosetta took out her curl-papers, packed her valise, and  caught the late afternoon train for Charlottetown, as she had  threatened.  All the way there she sat rigidly upright in her  seat and held imaginary dialogues with Charlotte in her mind,  running something like this on her part:--    \"No, Charlotte Wheeler, you are not going to have Jane's baby,  and you're very much mistaken if you think so.  Oh, all  right--we'll see!  You don't know anything about babies, even if  you are married.  I do.  Didn't I take William Ellis's baby, when  his wife died?  Tell me that, Charlotte Wheeler!  And didn't the  little thing thrive with me, and grow strong and healthy?  Yes,  even you have to admit that it did, Charlotte Wheeler.  And yet  you have the presumption to think that you ought to have Jane's  baby!  Yes, it is presumption, Charlotte Wheeler.  And when  William Ellis got married again, and took the baby, didn't the  child cling to me and cry as if I was its real mother?  You know  it did, Charlotte Wheeler.  I'm going to get and keep Jane's baby  in spite of you, Charlotte Wheeler, and I'd like to see you try  to prevent me--you that went and got married and never so much as  let your own sister know of it!  If I had got married in such a  fashion, Charlotte Wheeler, I'd be ashamed to look anybody in the  face for the rest of my natural life!\"    Miss Rosetta was so interested in thus laying down the law to  Charlotte, and in planning out the future life of Jane's baby,  that she didn't find the journey to Charlottetown so long or  tedious as might have been expected, considering her haste.  She  soon found her way to the house where her cousin lived.  There,  to her dismay and real sorrow, she learned that Mrs. Roberts had  died at four o'clock that afternoon.    \"She seemed dreadful anxious to live until she heard from some of  her folks out in Avonlea,\" said the woman who gave Miss Rosetta  the information.  \"She had written to them about her little girl.  She was my sister-in-law, and she lived with me ever since her  husband died.  I've done my best for her; but I've a big family  of my own and I can't see how I'm to keep the child.  Poor Jane  looked and longed for some one to come from Avonlea, but she  couldn't hold out.  A patient, suffering creature she was!\"    \"I'm her cousin,\" said Miss Rosetta, wiping her eyes, \"and I have  come for the baby.  I'll take it home with me after the funeral;  and, if you please, Mrs. Gordon, let me see it right away, so it  can get accustomed to me.  Poor Jane!  I wish I could have got  here in time to see her, she and I were such friends long ago.  We were far more intimate and confidential than ever her and  Charlotte was.  Charlotte knows that, too!\"    The vim with which Miss Rosetta snapped this out rather amazed  Mrs. Gordon, who couldn't understand it at all.  But she took  Miss Rosetta upstairs to the room where the baby was sleeping.    \"Oh, the little darling,\" cried Miss Rosetta, all her old  maidishness and oddity falling away from her like a garment, and  all her innate and denied motherhood shining out in her face like  a transforming illumination.  \"Oh, the sweet, dear, pretty little  thing!\"    The baby was a darling--a six-months' old beauty with little  golden ringlets curling and glistening all over its tiny head.  As Miss Rosetta hung over it, it opened its eyes and then held  out its tiny hands to her with a gurgle of confidence.    \"Oh, you sweetest!\" said Miss Rosetta rapturously, gathering it  up in her arms.  \"You belong to me, darling--never, never, to  that under-handed Charlotte!  What is its name, Mrs. Gordon?\"    \"It wasn't named,\" said Mrs. Gordon.  \"Guess you'll have to name  it yourself, Miss Ellis.\"    \"Camilla Jane,\" said Miss Rosetta without a moment's hesitation.  \"Jane after its mother, of course; and I have always thought  Camilla the prettiest name in the world.  Charlotte would be sure  to give it some perfectly heathenish name.  I wouldn't put it  past her calling the poor innocent Mehitable.\"    Miss Rosetta decided to stay in Charlottetown until after the  funeral.  That night she lay with the baby on her arm, listening  with joy to its soft little breathing.  She did not sleep or wish  to sleep.  Her waking fancies were more alluring than any visions  of dreamland.  Moreover, she gave a spice to them by occasionally  snapping some vicious sentences out loud at Charlotte.    Miss Rosetta fully expected Charlotte along on the following  morning and girded herself for the fray; but no Charlotte  appeared.  Night came; no Charlotte.  Another morning and no  Charlotte.  Miss Rosetta was hopelessly puzzled.  What had  happened?  Dear, dear, had Charlotte taken a bad heart spell, on  hearing that she, Rosetta, had stolen a march on her to  Charlottetown?  It was quite likely.  You never knew what to  expect of a woman who had married Jacob Wheeler!    The truth was, that the very evening Miss Rosetta had left  Avonlea Mrs. Jacob Wheeler's hired man had broken his leg and  had had to be conveyed to his distant home on a feather bed in an  express wagon.  Mrs. Wheeler could not leave home until she had  obtained another hired man.  Consequently, it was the evening  after the funeral when Mrs. Wheeler whisked up the steps of the  Gordon house and met Miss Rosetta coming out with a big white  bundle in her arms.    The eyes of the two women met defiantly.  Miss Rosetta's face  wore an air of triumph, chastened by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5341"],[0,"Kilmeny of the Orchard (#11)"],[1,"n. All the time I am saying the words in my head, just  as I hear other people saying them, but I never can make my tongue say  them. Do not look so sorry, my friend. I am very happy and I do not mind  so very much not being able to speak--only sometimes when I have so many  thoughts and it seems so slow to write them out, some of them get away  from me. I must play to you again. You look too sober.\"    She laughed again, picked up her violin, and played a tinkling, roguish  little melody as if she were trying to tease him, looking at Eric over  her violin with luminous eyes that dared him to be merry.    Eric smiled; but the puzzled look returned to his face many times that  evening. He walked home in a brown study. Kilmeny's case certainly  seemed a strange one, and the more he thought of it the stranger it  seemed.    \"It strikes me as something very peculiar that she should be able to  make sounds only when she is not thinking about it,\" he reflected. \"I  wish David Baker could examine her. But I suppose that is out of the  question. That grim pair who have charge of her would never consent.\"        CHAPTER IX. THE STRAIGHT SIMPLICITY OF EVE    For the next three weeks Eric Marshall seemed to himself to be living  two lives, as distinct from each other as if he possessed a double  personality. In one, he taught the Lindsay district school diligently  and painstakingly; solved problems; argued on theology with Robert  Williamson; called at the homes of his pupils and took tea in state  with their parents; went to a rustic dance or two and played havoc, all  unwittingly, with the hearts of the Lindsay maidens.    But this life was a dream of workaday. He only LIVED in the other, which  was spent in an old orchard, grassy and overgrown, where the minutes  seemed to lag for sheer love of the spot and the June winds made wild  harping in the old spruces.    Here every evening he met Kilmeny; in that old orchard they garnered  hours of quiet happiness together; together they went wandering in the  fair fields of old romance; together they read many books and talked of  many things; and, when they were tired of all else, Kilmeny played to  him and the old orchard echoed with her lovely, fantastic melodies.    At every meeting her beauty came home afresh to him with the old thrill  of glad surprise. In the intervals of absence it seemed to him that she  could not possibly be as beautiful as he remembered her; and then  when they met she seemed even more so. He learned to watch for the  undisguised light of welcome that always leaped into her eyes at the  sound of his footsteps. She was nearly always there before him and she  always showed that she was glad to see him with the frank delight of a  child watching for a dear comrade.    She was never in the same mood twice. Now she was grave, now gay, now  stately, now pensive. But she was always charming. Thrawn and twisted  the old Gordon stock might be, but it had at least this one offshoot of  perfect grace and symmetry. Her mind and heart, utterly unspoiled of the  world, were as beautiful as her face. All the ugliness of existence  had passed her by, shrined in her double solitude of upbringing and  muteness.    She was naturally quick and clever. Delightful little flashes of wit  and humour sparkled out occasionally. She could be whimsical--even  charmingly capricious. Sometimes innocent mischief glimmered out in the  unfathomable deeps of her blue eyes. Sarcasm, even, was not unknown to  her. Now and then she punctured some harmless bubble of a young man's  conceit or masculine superiority with a biting little line of daintily  written script.    She assimilated the ideas in the books they read, speedily, eagerly,  and thoroughly, always seizing on the best and truest, and rejecting the  false and spurious and weak with an unfailing intuition at which Eric  marvelled. Hers was the spear of Ithuriel, trying out the dross of  everything and leaving only the pure gold.    In manner and outlook she was still a child. Yet now and again she was  as old as Eve. An expression would leap into her laughing face, a subtle  meaning reveal itself in her smile, that held all the lore of womanhood  and all the wisdom of the ages.    Her way of smiling enchanted him. The smile always began far down in her  eyes and flowed outward to her face like a sparkling brook stealing out  of shadow into sunshine.    He knew everything about her life. She told him her simple history  freely. She often mentioned her uncle and aunt and seemed to regard them  with deep affection. She rarely spoke of her mother. Eric came somehow  to understand, less from what she said than from what she did not say,  that Kilmeny, though she had loved her mother, had always been rather  afraid of her. There had not been between them the natural beautiful  confidence of mother and child.    Of Neil, she wrote frequently at first, and seemed very fond of him.  Later she ceased to mention him. Perhaps--for she was marvellously quick  to catch and interpret every fleeting change of expression in his voice  and face--she discerned what Eric did not know himself--that his eyes  clouded and grew moody at the mention of Neil's name.    Once she asked him naively,    \"Are there many people like you out in the world?\"    \"Thousands of them,\" said Eric, laughing.    She looked gravely at him. Then she gave her head a quick decided little  shake.    \"I do not think so,\" she wrote. \"I do not know much of the world, but I  do not think there are many people like you in it.\"    One evening, when the far-away hills and fields were scarfed in gauzy  purples, and the intervales were brimming with golden mists, Eric  carried to the old orchard a little limp, worn volume that held a love  story. It was the first thing of the kind he had ever read to her,  for in the first novel he had lent her the love interest had been  very slight and subordinate. This was a beautiful, passionate idyl  exquisitely told.    He read it to her, lying in the grass at her feet; she listened with her  hands clasped over her knee and her eyes cast down. It was not a long  story; and when he had finished it he shut the book and looked up at her  questioningly.    \"Do you like it, Kilmeny?\" he asked.    Very slowly she took her slate and wrote,    \"Yes, I like it. But it hurt me, too. I did not know that a person could  like anything that hurt her. I do not know why it hurt me. I felt as if  I had lost something that I never had. That was a very silly feeling,  was it not? But I did not understand the book very well, you see. It is  about love and I do not know anything about love. Mother told me once  that love is a curse, and that I must pray that it would never enter  into my life. She said it very earnestly, and so I believed her. But  your book teaches that it is a blessing. It says that it is the most  splendid and wonderful thing in life. Which am I to believe?\"    \"Love--real love--is never a curse, Kilmeny,\" said Eric gravely. \"There  is a false love which IS a curse. Perhaps your mother believed it was  that which had entered her life and ruined it; and so she made the  mistake. There is nothing in the world--or in heaven either, as I  believe--so truly beautiful and wonderful and blessed as love.\"    \"Have you ever loved?\" asked Kilmeny, with the directness of phrasing  necessitated by her mode of communication which was sometimes a little  terrible. She asked the question simply and without embarrassment. She  knew of no reason why love might not be discussed with Eric as other  matters--music and books and travel--might be.    \"No,\" said Eric--honestly, as he thought, \"but every one has an ideal of  love whom he hopes to meet some day--'the ideal woman of a young man's  dream.' I suppose I have mine, in some sealed, secret chamber of my  heart.\"    \"I suppose your ideal woman would be beautiful, like the woman in your  book?\"    \"Oh, yes, I am sure I could never care for an ugly woman,\" said Eric,  laughing a little as he sat up. \"Our ideals are always beautiful,  whether they so translate themselves into realities or not. But the  sun is going down. Time does certainly fly in this enchanted orchard. I  believe you bewitch the moments away, Kilmeny. Your namesake of the  poem was a somewhat uncanny maid, if I recollect aright, and thought as  little of seven years in elfland as ordinary folk do of half an hour  on upper earth. Some day I shall waken from a supposed hour's lingering  here and find myself an old man with white hair and ragged coat, as in  that fairy tale we read the other night. Will you let me give you this  book? I should never commit the sacrilege of reading it in any other  place than this. It is an old book, Kilmeny. A new book, savouring of  the shop and market-place, however beautiful it might be, would not do  for you. This was one of my mother's books. She read it and loved it.  See--the faded rose leaves she placed in it one day are there still.  I'll write your name in it--that quaint, pretty name of yours which  always sounds as if it had been specially invented for you--'Kilmeny of  the Orchard'--and the date of this perfect June day on which we read it  together. Then when you look at it you will always remember me, and the  white buds opening on that rosebush beside you, and the rush and murmur  of the wind in the tops of those old spruces.\"    He held out the book to her, but, to his surprise, she shook her head,  with a deeper flush on her face.    \"Won't you take the book, Kilmeny? Why not?\"    She took her pencil and wrote slowly, unlike her usual quick movement.    \"Do not be offended with me. I shall not need anything to make me  remember you because I can never forget you. But I would rather not take  the book. I do not want to read it again. It is about love, and there is  no use in my learning about love, even if it is all you say. Nobody will  ever love me. I am too ugly.\"    \"You! Ugly!\""]]]
