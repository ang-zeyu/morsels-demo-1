Put under this box a  mouse-trap baited with bits of toasted cheese and on top of the box put  a heavy weight so the pigeons can not get at the trap. Set a few traps  around the feed bin also, and it will not be long until the last mouse  is caught, as they like cheese better than the grain which has brought  them to the pigeon house at first. A good cat kept around the feed room  is often a good investment, but do not forget that a cat likes squabs  very much and must be carefully kept outside the breeding lofts.      FEED A VARIETY    In the proper place we have given directions for mixing feed. We refer  to it in this place to emphasize the necessity of feeding a variety of  grains and the mixtures we recommend on previous pages will be found  such as will produce results. Never feed one grain for the reason that  it is cheaper than the other. It does not pay to economize in this way.  True economy in feeding is to feed the proper kinds and just as much as  the birds will eat without wasting. They always pick out the kind they  like the best first, but they should be compelled to eat the whole of  the feed each time and should be fed just as much as they will clean up  from one feeding to another.      VENTILATION    Most pigeon-breeders keep their houses closed too tight during the  winter. If cloth is used in the windows instead of glass, there will be  good ventilation all the time as the muslin used for the windows allows  the air to get in and keeps it pure inside; but where glass is used, the  fly holes should be left open nearly every night during the winter or  the air will become so impure that it will be likely to breed disease.  Pigeons when they are not breeding, do not mind cold weather, but  breeding birds should have a tight house on account of the squabs. See  to it that the ventilation is attended to.      TESTING PIGEON EGGS    If you want to know whether an egg is going to hatch after the hen has  been sitting for some time look through it, if it is clear it will not  hatch and might as well be thrown away. If it is partly clouded, the egg  will hatch but not for several days. If it is dark all over except at  the large end, the young bird will hatch in three or four days, or it  has died. To find if it is alive, put some water in a pan having it as  warm as the hand can be held in it without burning. Set the pan down and  put the egg in the water, little end down and let it float. If the bird  is alive it will struggle in the egg and cause it to bob around in the  water. Testing eggs is not necessary unless it is noticed that a certain  pair have set for a suspiciously long time.      SELECTING A SITE    In selecting a site for the pigeon house as much care and judgment  should be exercised as in choosing the location of one's own home. An  unhealthy location for man would most likely prove unhealthy for the  birds. A damp place, or one exposed to extremes of heat, cold or wind,  is to be rejected. The spot selected should be well drained, should be  facing the south or east, should be free from obstructions which shut  out the rays of the morning sun and be sheltered either by trees or  buildings from the north and west winds. Such a place, with a shallow  stream of pure running water for drinking and bathing--so essential to  the health of pigeons--will be an ideal site, and will require a minimum  of expense and daily work in caring for the stock. Of course, such sites  can only be obtained in the country.    In no case should a house be built for more than 250 pairs nor more than  50 pairs be kept in each section. It must be so designed as to be well  ventilated and easily kept clean, secure from attacks of mice, rats, and  other animals and not subject to drafts of air.    If feeding hoppers are used they should be of good size and properly  constructed. If you do not provide a liberal supply of mixed grit in a  suitable hopper, you should keep at least a peck of clean sharp sand on  the floor of each pen all the time. Provide salt, charcoal and oyster  shell and keep a clean supply of each before the birds at all times.    It is usually better, however, to procure a good health grit or the  tonic ingredients and mix the grit yourself.    In these receptacles should be kept a generous supply of sifted cracked  corn, Canada peas, wheat, German millet, kaffir corn and hemp. These are  the six principal feeds.    A room 8 by 10 feet will accommodate 50 pairs very comfortably. The fly  should be extended 32 feet if possible.    Pigeons should be fed twice a day--in the summer time at 6:30 a. m., and  4:30 p. m.; in the winter at 7:30 a. m., and 3:00 p. m.    The best kinds of feeds to use are cracked corn, red wheat, kaffir corn,  millet, peas, hemp and rice. In the morning give wheat, cracked corn,  and peas in equal parts; in the afternoon give equal parts of cracked  corn, peas, kaffir corn, and millet. The birds should be fed in the pen  rather than in the fly.    Water the birds every morning before feeding using nothing except fresh  pure water. Always clean out the fountains before filling.    Bathing is very essential to the health of pigeons. In summer they  should have an opportunity to bathe at least every other day. In winter  the bath should be given only on bright, sunny days. It is essential to  clean house every week. After cleaning the nests, put powdered  carbolated lime in all cracks, corners, and damp places. Sprinkle the  floor with lime and sprinkle a bucket of sand evenly over the lime.

On motion of Judge Duer, Washington Irving was elected President of the  meeting. On motion of Joseph Blunt, Fitz Greene Halleck and Rufus W.  Griswold were appointed Secretaries.    Mr. Blunt said, that as it had been thought proper to consider this  occasion as merely preliminary, and for the purpose of making arrangements  to do honor to the distinguished author who has left us, he would move that  a committee of five be appointed by the chair, to report what measures  should be adopted, by the literary gentlemen of this city and of the  country, so far as they may see fit to join them, for the purpose of  rendering appropriate honors to the memory of the late J. Fenimore Cooper.    The motion was adopted, and the chair appointed the following gentlemen  members of the committee: Judge Duer, Richard B. Kimball, Dr. Francis, Fitz  Greene Halleck, and George Bancroft; to whom Washington Irving and Rufus W.  Griswold were subsequently added. The meeting then adjourned.    This committee afterwards met and appointed as a General Committee to carry  out the designs of the meeting: Washington Irving, James K. Paulding, John  W. Francis, Gulian C. Verplanck, Charles King, Richard B. Kimball, Rufus  W. Griswold, Lewis Gaylord Clarke, Francis L. Hawks, John A. Dix, George  Bancroft, Fitz Greene Halleck, John Duer, William C. Bryant, George P.  Morris, Charles Anthon, Samuel Osgood, J. M. Wainright, and William W.  Campbell.    R. W. Griswold, Donald G. Mitchell, Parke Godwin, C. F. Briggs, and  Starbuck Mayo were appointed a Committee of Correspondence.    Besides letters from many of the gentlemen present, others had been  received from some twenty of the most eminent literary men of the United  States, all expressing the warmest sympathy in the proposal to do every  possible honor to the memory of Mr. Cooper. We copy from these the  following:    _From Washington Irving._                        SUNNYSIDE, Thursday, Sept. 18, 1851.         MY DEAR SIR:--The death of Fenimore Cooper, though       anticipated, is an event of deep and public concern,       and calls for the highest expression of public       sensibility. To me it comes with something of a shock;       for it seems but the other day that I saw him at our       common literary resort at Putnam's, in full vigor of       mind and body, a very \"castle of a man,\" and apparently       destined to outlive me, who am several years his       senior. He has left a space in our literature which       will not easily be supplied....         I shall not fail to attend the proposed meeting on       Wednesday next. Very respectfully, your friend and       servant,                                  WASHINGTON IRVING.          Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    _From William C. Bryant._                                  ROCHESTER, Friday, Sept. 19, 1851.         MY DEAR SIR:--I am sorry that the arrangements for my       journey to the West are such that I cannot be present       at the meeting which is about to be held to do honor to       the memory of Mr. Cooper, on losing whom not only the       country, but the civilized world and the age in which       we live, have lost one of their most illustrious       ornaments. It is melancholy to think that it is only       until such men are in their graves that full justice is       done to their merit. I shall be most happy to concur in       any step which may be taken to express, in a public       manner, our respect for the character of one to whom we       were too sparing of public distinctions in his       lifetime, and beg that I may be included in the       proceedings of the occasion as if I were present. I am,       very respectfully yours,                                  WM. C. BRYANT.         Rev. R. W. GRISWOLD.    _From Bishop Doane._                                  RIVERSIDE, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 1851.         MY DEAR SIR:--...I beg you to say, generally, in your       discretion, that I yield to no one who will be present,       in my estimate of the distinguished talents and       admirable services of Mr. Cooper, or in my readiness to       do the highest honor to his illustrious memory. His       name must ever find a place among the \"household words\"       of all our hearts; a name as beautiful for its       blamelessness of life, as it is eminent for its       attainments in letters, which has subordinated to the       higher interests of patriotism and piety, the fervors       of fancy and the fascinations of romance. Very       faithfully, your friend and servant,                                  G. W. DOANE.         Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    _From Mr. Bancroft._                       NEWPORT, R. I., Thursday, Sept. 18, 1851.         MY DEAR SIR:--I heartily sympathize with the design of       a public tribute to the genius, manly character, and       great career of the illustrious man whose loss we       deplore. Others have combined very high merit as       authors, with professional pursuits. Mr. Cooper was, of       those who have gone from among us, the first to devote       himself exclusively to letters. We must admire the       noble courage with which he entered on a course which       none before him had tried; the glory which he justly       won was reflected on his country, of whose literary       independence he was the pioneer, and deserves the       grateful recognition of all who survive him.         By the time proposed for the meeting, I fear I shall       not be able to return to New-York; but you may use my       name in any manner that shall strongly express my       delight in the writings of our departed friend, my       thorough respect for his many virtues, and my sense of       that surpassing ability which has made his own name and       the names of the creations of his fancy, household       words throughout the civilized world. I remain, dear       sir, very truly yours,                                  GEORGE BANCROFT.         Rev. R. W. GRISWOLD.    _From John P. Kennedy._                                  BALTIMORE, October, 1851.         DEAR SIR:--Your invitation reached me too late to       enable me to participate in the meeting which has just       been held at the City Hall in your city, to render       appropriate honors to the memory of Mr. Cooper.         I rejoice to see what has been done and what you       propose to do. It is due to the eminent merits of       Fenimore Cooper, that there should be an impressive       public recognition of the loss which our country has       sustained in his death. He stood confessedly at the       head of a most attractive and popular department of our       literature, in which his extraordinary success had       raised him up a fame that became national. The country       claimed it as its own. This fame was acknowledged and       appreciated not only wherever the English tongue is the       medium of thought, but every where amongst the most       civilized nations of Europe.         Our literature, in the lifetime of the present       generation, has grown to a maturity which has given it       a distinction and honorable place in that aggregate       which forms national character. No man has done more in       his sphere to elevate and dignify that character than       Fenimore Cooper: no man is more worthy than he, for       such services, of the highest honors appropriate to a       literary benefactor. His genius has contributed a rich       fund to the instruction and delight of his countrymen,       which will long be preserved amongst the choicest       treasures of American letters, and will equally induce       to render our national literature attractive to other       nations. We owe a memorial and a monument to the man       who has achieved this. This work is the peculiar       privilege of the distinguished scholars of New-York,       and I have no doubt will be warmly applauded, and if       need be, assisted, by every scholar and friend of       letters in the Union.         With the best wishes for the success of this       enterprise, I am, my dear sir, very truly yours,                                  JOHN P. KENNEDY.         Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.    _From C. J. Ingersoll._                   FONTHILL, PHILADELPHIA, September, 30th, 1851.         DEAR SIR:--Your favor, inviting me to a meeting of the       friends of Fenimore Cooper, did not reach me till this       morning, owing probably to irregularity of the       post-office. Otherwise I should have tried to attend       the proposed meeting, not only as a friend of Mr.       Cooper, but as one among those of his countrymen who       consider his memory a national trust for honored       preservation.         In my opinion of Fenimore Cooper as a novelist he is       entitled to one merit to which few if any one of his       cotemporary European romance writers can lay claim, to       wit, originality.
