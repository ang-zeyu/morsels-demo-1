He ain't worth more.\" To look at Nack-yal had pleased Shefford very  much indeed, but, once upon his back, he grew dubious. The mustang  acted queer. He actually looked back at Shefford, and it was a look of  speculation and disdain. Shefford took exception to Nack-yal's manner  and to his reluctance to go, and especially to a habit the mustang had  of turning off the trail to the left. Shefford had managed some rather  spirited horses back in Illinois; and though he was willing and eager to  learn all over again, he did not enjoy the prospect of Lake and Withers  seeing this black mustang make a novice of him. And he guessed that was  just what Nack-yal intended to do. However, once up over the hill, with  Kayenta out of sight, Nack-yal trotted along fairly well, needing only  now and then to be pulled back from his strange swinging to the left off  the trail.    The pack-train traveled steadily and soon crossed the upland plain to  descend into the valley again. Shefford saw the jagged red peaks with  an emotion he could not name. The canyon between them were purple in the  shadows, the great walls and slopes brightened to red, and the tips were  gold in the sun. Shefford forgot all about his mustang and the trail.    Suddenly with a pound of hoofs Nack-yal seemed to rise. He leaped  sidewise out of the trail, came down stiff-legged. Then Shefford shot  out of the saddle. He landed so hard that he was stunned for an instant.  Sitting up, he saw the mustang bent down, eyes and ears showing fight,  and his forefeet spread. He appeared to be looking at something in the  trail. Shefford got up and soon saw what had been the trouble. A long,  crooked stick, rather thick and black and yellow, lay in the trail, and  any mustang looking for an excuse to jump might have mistaken it for  a rattlesnake. Nack-yal appeared disposed to be satisfied, and gave  Shefford no trouble in mounting. The incident increased Shefford's  dubiousness. These Arizona mustangs were unknown quantities.    Thereafter Shefford had an eye for the trail rather than the scenery,  and this continued till the pack-train entered the mouth of the Sagi.  Then those wonderful lofty cliffs, with their peaks and towers and  spires, loomed so close and so beautiful that he did not care if  Nack-yal did throw him. Along here, however, the mustang behaved well,  and presently Shefford decided that if it had been otherwise he would  have walked. The trail suddenly stood on end and led down into the deep  wash, where some days before he had seen the stream of reddish water.  This day there appeared to be less water and it was not so red. Nack-yal  sank deep as he took short and careful steps down. The burros and other  mustangs were drinking, and Nack-yal followed suit. The Indian, with a  hand clutching his mustang's mane, rode up a steep, sandy slope on the  other side that Shefford would not have believed any horse could climb.  The burros plodded up and over the rim, with Withers calling to them.  Joe Lake swung his rope and cracked the flanks of the gray mare and the  red mule; and the way the two kicked was a revelation and a warning to  Shefford. When his turn came to climb the trail he got off and walked,  an action that Nack-yal appeared fully to appreciate.    From the head of this wash the trail wound away up the widening canyon,  through greasewood flats and over grassy levels and across sandy  stretches. The looming walls made the valley look narrow, yet it must  have been half a mile wide. The slopes under the cliffs were dotted with  huge stones and cedar-trees. There were deep indentations in the walls,  running back to form box canyon, choked with green of cedar and spruce  and pinyon. These notches haunted Shefford, and he was ever on the  lookout for more of them.    Withers came back to ride just in advance and began to talk.    \"Reckon this Sagi canyon is your Deception Pass,\" he said. \"It's sure  a queer hole. I've been lost more than once, hunting mustangs in here.  I've an idea Nas Ta Bega knows all this country. He just pointed out  a cliff-dwelling to me. See it?... There 'way up in that cave of the  wall.\"    Shefford saw a steep, rough slope leading up to a bulge of the cliff,  and finally he made out strange little houses with dark, eyelike  windows. He wanted to climb up there. Withers called his attention to  more caves with what he believed were the ruins of cliff-dwellings. And  as they rode along the trader showed him remarkable formations of  rock where the elements were slowly hollowing out a bridge. They came  presently to a region of intersecting canyon, and here the breaking of  the trail up and down the deep washes took Withers back to his task with  the burros and gave Shefford more concern than he liked with Nack-yal.  The mustang grew unruly and was continually turning to the left.  Sometimes he tried to climb the steep slope. He had to be pulled hard  away from the opening canyon on the left. It seemed strange to Shefford  that the mustang never swerved to the right. This habit of Nack-yal's  and the increasing caution needed on the trail took all of Shefford's  attention. When he dismounted, however, he had a chance to look around,  and more and more he was amazed at the increasing proportions and  wildness of the Sagi.    He came at length to a place where a fallen tree blocked the trail. All  of the rest of the pack-train had jumped the log. But Nack-yal balked.  Shefford dismounted, pulled the bridle over the mustang's head, and  tried to lead him. Nack-yal, however, refused to budge. Whereupon  Shefford got a stick and, remounting, he gave the balky mustang a cut  across the flank. Then something violent happened. Shefford received a  sudden propelling jolt, and then he was rising into the air, and then  falling. Before he alighted he had a clear image of Nack-yal in the air  above him, bent double, and seemingly possessed of devils. Then Shefford  hit the ground with no light thud. He was thoroughly angry when he got  dizzily upon his feet, but he was not quick enough to catch the mustang.  Nack-yal leaped easily over the log and went on ahead, dragging his  bridle. Shefford hurried after him, and the faster he went just by so  much the cunning Nack-yal accelerated his gait. As the pack-train was  out of sight somewhere ahead, Shefford could not call to his companions  to halt his mount, so he gave up trying, and walked on now with free and  growing appreciation of his surroundings.    The afternoon had waned. The sun blazed low in the west in a notch of  the canyon ramparts, and one wall was darkening into purple shadow while  the other shone through a golden haze. It was a weird, wild world  to Shefford, and every few strides he caught his breath and tried to  realize actuality was not a dream.    Nack-yal kept about a hundred paces to the fore and ever and anon he  looked back to see how his new master was progressing. He varied these  occasions by reaching down and nipping a tuft of grass. Evidently he was  too intelligent to go on fast enough to be caught by Withers. Also he  kept continually looking up the slope to the left as if seeking a way to  climb out of the valley in that direction. Shefford thought it was  well the trail lay at the foot of a steep slope that ran up to unbroken  bluffs.    The sun set and the canyon lost its red and its gold and deepened its  purple. Shefford calculated he had walked five miles, and though he did  not mind the effort, he would rather have ridden Nack-yal into camp.  He mounted a cedar ridge, crossed some sandy washes, turned a corner of  bold wall to enter a wide, green level. The mustangs were rolling and  snorting. He heard the bray of a burro. A bright blaze of camp-fire  greeted him, and the dark figure of the Indian approached to intercept  and catch Nack-yal. When he stalked into camp Withers wore a beaming  smile, and Joe Lake, who was on his knees making biscuit dough in a pan,  stopped proceedings and drawled:    \"Reckon Nack-yal bucked you off.\"    \"Bucked! Was that it? Well, he separated himself from me in a new and  somewhat painful manner--to me.\"    \"Sure, I saw that in his eye,\" replied Lake; and Withers laughed with  him.    \"Nack-yal never was well broke,\" he said. \"But he's a good mustang,  nothing like Joe's Navvy or that gray mare Dynamite. All this Indian  stock will buck on a man once in a while.\"    \"I'll take the bucking along with the rest,\" said Shefford. Both men  liked his reply, and the Indian smiled for the first time.    Soon they all sat round a spread tarpaulin and ate like wolves. After  supper came the rest and talk before the camp-fire. Joe Lake was droll;  he said the most serious things in a way to make Shefford wonder if  he was not joking. Withers talked about the canyon, the Indians, the  mustangs, the scorpions running out of the heated sand; and to Shefford  it was all like a fascinating book. Nas Ta Bega smoked in silence, his  brooding eyes upon the fire.          V. ON THE TRAIL      Shefford was awakened next morning by a sound he had never heard  before--the plunging of hobbled horses on soft turf. It was clear  daylight, with a ruddy color in the sky and a tinge of red along the  canyon rim. He saw Withers, Lake, and the Indian driving the mustangs  toward camp.    The burros appeared lazy, yet willing. But the mustangs and the mule  Withers called Red and the gray mare Dynamite were determined not to be  driven into camp. It was astonishing how much action they had, how much  ground they could cover with their forefeet hobbled together. They  were exceedingly skilful; they lifted both forefeet at once, and then  plunged. And they all went in different directions. Nas Ta Bega darted  in here and there to head off escape.    Shefford pulled on his boots and went out to help.

Not in the army, no.     Nor Polish aid, but in opinion--yes,     In popular opinion. Dost remember     The triumph of Dimitry, dost remember     His peaceful conquests, when, without a blow     The docile towns surrendered, and the mob     Bound the recalcitrant leaders? Thou thyself     Saw'st it; was it of their free-will our troops     Fought with him? And when did they so? Boris     Was then supreme.
