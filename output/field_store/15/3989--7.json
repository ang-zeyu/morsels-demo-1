I sat  beside him on his bed, and struck up an acquaintance, and he told me  all about it. First he asked me would I mind shifting round to the other  side, as he was rather deaf in that ear. He'd been kicked by a horse, he  said, and had been a little dull o' hearing on that side ever since.    He was as good as blind. \"I can see the people near me,\" he said, \"but  I can't make out their faces. I can just make out the pavement and the  houses close at hand, and all the rest is a sort of white blur.\" He  looked up: \"That ceiling is a kind of white, ain't it? And this,\"  tapping the wall and putting his nose close to it, \"is a sort of green,  ain't it?\" The ceiling might have been whiter. The prevalent tints of  the wall-paper had originally been blue and red, but it was mostly green  enough now--a damp, rotten green; but I was ready to swear that the  ceiling was snow and that the walls were as green as grass if it would  have made him feel more comfortable. His sight began to get bad about  six years before, he said; he didn't take much notice of it at first,  and then he saw a quack, who made his eyes worse. He had already the  manner of the blind--the touch of every finger, and even the gentleness  in his speech. He had a boy down with him--a \"sorter cousin of his,\" and  the boy saw him round. \"I'll have to be sending that youngster back,\"  he said, \"I think I'll send him home next week. He'll be picking up and  learning too much down here.\"    I happened to know the district he came from, and we would sit by the  hour and talk about the country, and chaps by the name of this and chaps  by the name of that--drovers mostly, whom we had met or had heard of.  He asked me if I'd ever heard of a chap by the name of Joe Scott--a big  sandy-complexioned chap, who might be droving; he was his brother, or,  at least, his half-brother, but he hadn't heard of him for years;  he'd last heard of him at Blackall, in Queensland; he might have gone  overland to Western Australia with Tyson's cattle to the new country.    We talked about grubbing and fencing and digging and droving and  shearing--all about the bush--and it all came back to me as we talked.  \"I can see it all now,\" he said once, in an abstracted tone, seeming to  fix his helpless eyes on the wall opposite. But he didn't see the dirty  blind wall, nor the dingy window, nor the skimpy little bed, nor the  greasy wash-stand; he saw the dark blue ridges in the sunlight, the  grassy sidings and flats, the creek with clumps of she-oak here and  there, the course of the willow-fringed river below, the distant peaks  and ranges fading away into a lighter azure, the granite ridge in  the middle distance, and the rocky rises, the stringy-bark and the  apple-tree flats, the scrubs, and the sunlit plains--and all. I could  see it, too--plainer than ever I did.    He had done a bit of fencing in his time, and we got talking about  timber. He didn't believe in having fencing-posts with big butts; he  reckoned it was a mistake. \"You see,\" he said, \"the top of the butt  catches the rain water and makes the post rot quicker. I'd back posts  without any butt at all to last as long or longer than posts with  'em--that's if the fence is well put up and well rammed.\" He had  supplied fencing stuff, and fenced by contract, and--well, you can get  more posts without butts out of a tree than posts with them. He also  objected to charring the butts. He said it only made more work--and  wasted time--the butts lasted longer without being charred.    I asked him if he'd ever got stringy-bark palings or shingles out of  mountain ash, and he smiled a smile that did my heart good to see, and  said he had. He had also got them out of various other kinds of trees.    We talked about soil and grass, and gold-digging, and many other things  which came back to one like a revelation as we yarned.    He had been to the hospital several times. \"The doctors don't say they  can cure me,\" he said, \"they say they might, be able to improve my sight  and hearing, but it would take a long time--anyway, the treatment would  improve my general health. They know what's the matter with my eyes,\"  and he explained it as well as he could. \"I wish I'd seen a good  doctor when my eyes first began to get weak; but young chaps are always  careless over things. It's harder to get cured of anything when you're  done growing.\"    He was always hopeful and cheerful. \"If the worst comes to the worst,\"  he said, \"there's things I can do where I come from. I might do a bit  o' wool-sorting, for instance. I'm a pretty fair expert. Or else when  they're weeding out I could help. I'd just have to sit down and they'd  bring the sheep to me, and I'd feel the wool and tell them what it  was--being blind improves the feeling, you know.\"    He had a packet of portraits, but he couldn't make them out very well  now. They were sort of blurred to him, but I described them and he told  me who they were. \"That's a girl o' mine,\" he said, with reference  to one--a jolly, good-looking bush girl. \"I got a letter from her  yesterday. I managed to scribble something, but I'll get you, if you  don't mind, to write something more I want to put in on another piece of  paper, and address an envelope for me.\"    Darkness fell quickly upon him now--or, rather, the \"sort of white blur\"  increased and closed in. But his hearing was better, he said, and he was  glad of that and still cheerful. I thought it natural that his hearing  should improve as he went blind.    One day he said that he did not think he would bother going to the  hospital any more. He reckoned he'd get back to where he was known. He'd  stayed down too long already, and the \"stuff\" wouldn't stand it. He was  expecting a letter that didn't come. I was away for a couple of days,  and when I came back he had been shifted out of the room and had a bed  in an angle of the landing on top of the staircase, with the people  brushing against him and stumbling over his things all day on their way  up and down. I felt indignant, thinking that--the house being full--the  boss had taken advantage of the bushman's helplessness and good nature  to put him there. But he said that he was quite comfortable. \"I can get  a whiff of air here,\" he said.    Going in next day I thought for a moment that I had dropped suddenly  back into the past and into a bush dance, for there was a concertina  going upstairs. He was sitting on the bed, with his legs crossed, and  a new cheap concertina on his knee, and his eyes turned to the patch of  ceiling as if it were a piece of music and he could read it. \"I'm trying  to knock a few tunes into my head,\" he said, with a brave smile, \"in  case the worst comes to the worst.\" He tried to be cheerful, but seemed  worried and anxious. The letter hadn't come. I thought of the many blind  musicians in Sydney, and I thought of the bushman's chance, standing at  a corner swanking a cheap concertina, and I felt sorry for him.    I went out with a vague idea of seeing someone about the matter, and  getting something done for the bushman--of bringing a little influence  to his assistance; but I suddenly remembered that my clothes were worn  out, my hat in a shocking state, my boots burst, and that I owed for a  week's board and lodging, and was likely to be thrown out at any moment  myself; and so I was not in a position to go where there was influence.    When I went back to the restaurant there was a long, gaunt  sandy-complexioned bushman sitting by Jack's side. Jack introduced him  as his brother, who had returned unexpectedly to his native district,  and had followed him to Sydney. The brother was rather short with me  at first, and seemed to regard the restaurant people--all of us, in  fact--in the light of spielers who wouldn't hesitate to take advantage  of Jack's blindness if he left him a moment; and he looked ready  to knock down the first man who stumbled against Jack, or over his  luggage--but that soon wore off. Jack was going to stay with Joe at the  Coffee Palace for a few weeks, and then go back up-country, he told me.  He was excited and happy. His brother's manner towards him was as if  Jack had just lost his wife, or boy or someone very dear to him. He  would not allow him to do anything for himself, nor try to--not even  lace up his boot. He seemed to think that he was thoroughly helpless,  and when I saw him pack up Jack's things, and help him at the table and  fix his tie and collar with his great brown hands, which trembled all  the time with grief and gentleness, and make Jack sit down on the  bed whilst he got a cab and carried the trap down to it, and take  him downstairs as if he were made of thin glass, and settle with the  landlord--then I knew that Jack was all right.    We had a drink together--Joe, Jack, the cabman, and I. Joe was very  careful to hand Jack the glass, and Jack made joke about it for Joe's  benefit. He swore he could see a glass yet, and Joe laughed, but looked  extra troubled the next moment.    I felt their grips on my hand for five minutes after we parted.          ARVIE ASPINALL'S ALARM CLOCK      In one of these years a paragraph appeared in a daily paper to the  effect that a constable had discovered a little boy asleep on the steps  of Grinder Bros' factory at four o'clock one rainy morning. He awakened  him, and demanded an explanation.    The little fellow explained that he worked there, and was frightened  of being late; he started work at six, and was apparently greatly  astonished to hear that it was only four. The constable examined a small  parcel which the frightened child had in his hand. It contained a clean  apron and three slices of bread and treacle.    The child further explained that he woke up and thought it was late,  and didn't like to wake mother and ask her the time \"because she'd been  washin'.\" He didn't look at the clock, because"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7188"],[0,"Higher Lessons in English: A work on English grammar and composition (#11)"],[1,"and grumbling, and      curls one up in the chimney-corner.  15. The south wind is full of longing and unrest and effeminate suggestions      of luxurious ease.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 30.    ATTRIBUTE COMPLEMENTS--CONTINUED.    Analysis.    1. He went out as mate and came back captain.                       as                     ---                      '              went  \\ '  mate         /=======================   He | /   '    \\out  ====|=and '      | \\   ' came  \\    captain         \\=======================                 \\back    +Explanation+.--_Mate_, like _captain_, is an attribute complement. Some  would say that the conjunction _as_ connects _mate_ to _he_; but we think  this connection is made through the verb _went_, and that _as_ is simply  introductory. This is indicated in the diagram.    2. The sun shines bright and hot at midday.  3. Velvet feels smooth, and looks rich and glossy.  4. She grew tall, queenly, and beautiful.  5. Plato and Aristotle are called the two head-springs of all philosophy.  6. Under the Roman law, every son was regarded as a slave.  7. He came a foe and returned a friend.  8. I am here. I am present.    +Explanation+.--The office of an adverb sometimes seems to fade into that  of an adjective attribute and is not easily distinguished from it. _Here_,  like an adjective, seems to complete _am_, and, like an adverb to modify  it. From their form and usual function, _here,_ in this example, should be  called an adverb, and _present_ an adjective.    9. This book is presented to you as a token of esteem and gratitude.  10. The warrior fell back upon the bed a lifeless corpse.  11. The apple tastes and smells delicious.  12. Lord Darnley turned out a dissolute and insolent husband.  13. In the fable of the Discontented Pendulum, the weights hung speechless.  14. The brightness and freedom of the New Learning seemed incarnate in the      young and scholarly Sir Thomas More.  15. Sir Philip Sidney lived and died the darling of the Court, and the      gentleman and idol of the time.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 31.    OBJECTIVE COMPLEMENTS.    +Introductory Hints+.--_He made the wall white._ Here _made_ does not fully  express the act performed upon the wall. We do not mean to say, He _made_  the white _wall_, but, He _made-white_ (_whitened_) the wall. _White_ helps  _made_ to express the act, and at the same time it denotes the quality  attributed to the wall as the result of the act.    _They made Victoria queen_. Here _made_ does not fully express the act  performed upon Victoria. They did not _make_ Victoria, but _made-queen_  (_crowned_) Victoria. _Queen_ helps _made_ to express the act, and at the  same time denotes the office to which the act raised Victoria.    A word that, like the adjective _white_ or the noun _queen_, helps to  complete the predicate and at the same time belongs to the object  complement, differs from an attribute complement by belonging not to the  subject but to the object complement, and so is called an +Objective  Complement+.    As the objective complement generally denotes what the receiver of the act  is made to be, in fact or in thought, it is sometimes called the _factitive  complement_ or the _factitive object_ (Lat. _facere_, to make). [Footnote:  See Lesson 37, last foot-note.]    Some of the other verbs which are thus completed are _call_, _think_,  _choose_, and _name_.      +DEFINITION.--The _Objective Complement_ completes the predicate and  belongs to the object complement.+    Analysis.    1. They made Victoria queen.     They | made / queen | Victoria  ======|=========================        |    +Explanation+.--The line that separates _made_ from _queen_ slants toward  the object complement to show that _queen_ belongs to the object.    +Oral Analysis+.--_Queen_ is an objective complement completing _made_ and  belonging to _Victoria_; _made Victoria queen_ is the complete predicate.    2. Some one has called the eye the window of the soul.  3. Destiny had made Mr. Churchill a schoolmaster.  4. President Hayes chose the Hon. Wm. M. Evarts Secretary of State.  5. After a break of sixty years in the ducal line of the English nobility,     James I. created the worthless Villiers Duke of Buckingham.  6. We should consider time as a sacred trust.    +Explanation+.--_As_ may be used simply to introduce an objective  complement.    7. Ophelia and Polonius thought Hamlet really insane.  8. The President and the Senate appoint certain men ministers to foreign     courts.  9. Shylock would have struck Jessica dead beside him.  10. Custom renders the feelings blunt and callous.  11. Socrates styled beauty a short-lived tyranny.  12. Madame de Stael calls beautiful architecture frozen music.  13. They named the state New York from the Duke of York.  14. Henry the Great consecrated the Edict of Nantes as the very ark of the      constitution.           *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 32.    COMPOSITION--COMPLEMENTS.    +Caution.+--Be careful to distinguish an adjective complement from an  adverb modifier.    +Explanation.+--Mary arrived _safe_. We here wish to tell the condition of  Mary on her arrival, and not the manner of her arriving. My head feels  _bad_ (is in a bad condition, as perceived by the sense of feeling). The  sun shines _bright_ (is bright, as perceived by its shining).    When the idea of being is prominent in the verb, as in the examples above,  you see that the adjective, and not the adverb, follows.    +Direction.+--_Justify the use of these adjectives and adverbs_:--    1. The boy is running wild.  2. The boy is running wildly about.  3. They all arrived safe and sound.  4. The day opened bright.  5. He felt awkward in the presence of ladies.  6. He felt around awkwardly for his chair.  7. The sun shines bright.  8. The sun shines brightly on the tree-tops.  9. He appeared prompt and willing.  10. He appeared promptly and willingly.    +Direction+.--_Correct these errors and give your reasons_:--    1. My head pains me very bad.  2. My friend has acted very strange in the matter.  3. Don't speak harsh.  4. It can be bought very cheaply.  5. I feel tolerable well.  6. She looks beautifully.    +Direction+.--_Join to each of the nouns below three appropriate adjectives  expressing the qualities as assumed, and then make complete sentences by  asserting these qualities_:--    +Model.+    Hard         |    brittle      +  glass.    transparent  |    Glass is hard, brittle, and transparent.    Coal, iron, Niagara Falls, flowers, war, ships.    +Direction+.--_Compose sentences containing these nouns as attribute  complements_:--    Emperor, mathematician, Longfellow, Richmond.    +Direction+.--_Compose sentences, using these verbs as predicates, and  these pronouns as attribute complements_:--    Is, was, might have been; I, we, he, she, they.    +Remark+.--Notice that these forms of the pronouns--_I, we, thou, he, she,  ye, they_, and _who_--are never used as object complements or as principal  words in prepositional phrases; and that _me, us, thee, him, her, them_,  and _whom_ are never used as subjects or as attribute complements of  sentences.    +Direction+.--_Compose sentences in which each of the following verbs shall  have two complements--the one an object complement, the other an objective  complement:_--    Let some object complements be pronouns, and let some objective complements  be introduced by _as_.    +Model+.--They call _me chief_. We regard composition _as_ very  _important_.    Make, appoint, consider, choose, call.            *       *       *       *       *    LESSON 33.    NOUNS AS ADJECTIVE MODIFIERS.    +Introductory Hints+.--_Solomon's temple was destroyed. Solomon's_ limits  _temple_ by telling what or whose temple is spoken of, and is therefore a  modifier of _temple_.    The relation of Solomon to the temple is expressed by the apostrophe and  _s_ ('_s_) added to the noun _Solomon_. When _s_ has been added to the noun  to denote more than one, this relation of possession is expressed by the  apostrophe alone ('); as, _boys'_ hats. This same relation of possession  may be expressed by the preposition _of_; _Solomon's_ temple = the temple  _of Solomon_.    _Dom Pedro, the emperor, was welcomed by the Americans_. The noun _emperor_  modifies _Dom Pedro_ by telling what Dom Pedro is meant. Both words name  the same person.    _Solomon's_ and _emperor_, like adjectives, modify nouns; but they are  names of things, and are modified by adjectives and not by adverbs; as,  _the wise_ Solomon's temple; Dom Pedro, _the Brazilian_ emperor. These are  conclusive reasons for calling such words nouns.    They represent two kinds of +Noun Modifiers+--the +Possessive+ and the  +Explanatory+.    The Explanatory Modifier is often called an +Appositive+. It identifies or  explains by adding another name of the same thing.    Analysis.    1. Elizabeth's favorite, Raleigh, was beheaded by James I.     favorite (Raleigh) | was beheaded  ====================|==============   \\Elizabeth's       |  \\by                          \\    James I                           \\-----------    +Oral Analysts+.--_Elizabeth's_ and _Raleigh_ are modifiers of the subject;  the first word telling whose favorite is meant, the second what favorite.  _Elizabeth's favorite, Raleigh_ is the modified subject.    2. The best features of King James's translation of the Bible are derived     from Tyndale's version.  3. St. Paul, the apostle, was beheaded in the reign of Nero.  4. A fool's bolt is soon shot.  5. The tadpole, or polliwog, becomes a frog.  6. An idle brain is the devil's workshop.  7. Mahomet, or Mohammed, was born in the year 569 and died in 632.  8.
