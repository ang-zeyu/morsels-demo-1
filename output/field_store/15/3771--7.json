Occurs from 3100 feet in  Oaxaca up to 6000 feet in Puebla.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; dorsum Drab, terminal parts  of individual guard hairs black, Neutral Gray basally, distal parts of  underfur Pinkish Buff, proximally Neutral Gray; sides same color as  dorsum; hairs in region of throat and chin white to base; venter whitish  to Neutral Gray with tinges of Pinkish Buff; dorsal parts of forefeet  and hind feet whitish with flesh-colored undertones, ventral parts  whitish to dusky-gray; tail bicolored, grayish-brown above, white below;  tip of tail not bicolored, instead grayish-brown throughout; ears pale  brown, sparsely haired; incisive foramina long, not constricted  posteriorly. Average and extreme external measurements for 9 adults from  the type locality are as follows: total length, 113.9 (106-122); length  of tail vertebrae, 44.1 (41-48); length of body, 71.0 (65-79); length of  hind foot, 14.8 (13-16); length of ear, 11.9 (11-12). Average and  extreme cranial measurements of 7 adults from the type locality are as  follows: Occipitonasal length, 20.1 (19.7-20.4); zygomatic breadth, 10.4  (10.2-10.6); postpalatal length, 7.3 (7.0-7.7); least interorbital  breadth, 4.2 (4.0-4.4); length of incisive foramina, 4.8 (4.4-5.6);  length of rostrum, 7.2 (6.6-7.5); breadth of braincase, 9.6 (9.5-9.8);  depth of cranium, 7.4 (7.1-7.6); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.3 (3.1-3.4); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_d_, and Plate 3_d_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. nigrescens_ and _B. m.  brunneus_, see accounts of those subspecies. From _B. m. pallidus_, _B.  m. infernatis_ differs in: sides, ears, and dorsum paler (less of dark  brown); venter whitish gray rather than gray with tinge of buff and  brown; forefeet and hind feet paler; tail bicolored, not unicolored;  incisive foramina longer and not constricted posteriorly; mastoid  process turning dorsally and sickle-shaped at posteriormost point rather  than capitate.    _Remarks._--_B. m. infernatis_ resembles _B. m. handleyi_ more than any  other subspecies in color of pelage and in external and cranial  dimensions. The resemblance in color between _B. m. pallidus_, in  certain parts of its range, and _B. m. handleyi_ may have resulted from  nearly parallel selective forces that gave rise to two subspecies,  widely separated geographically. The same relation obtains between _B.  m. infernatis_ and _B. m. handleyi_. Both inhabit arid river basins. In  them, pale soil and low relative humidity are important passive factors  of selection that give adaptive value to the pale colors of pelage of  both _infernatis_ and _handleyi_.    Specimens from 6-1/2 mi. SW Izucar de Matemores, and 1 mi. SSW Tilapa,  Puebla, are intergrades between _B. m. infernatis_ and _B. m.  pallidus_. These specimens are intermediate in color and cranial  characters between the aforementioned subspecies but possess more of the  pale brown overtones seen in paratypes of _pallidus_, and are best  referred to that subspecies.    _Specimens examined_ (All in Univ. Michigan, Mus. Zool.).--Total 18, all  from the Republic of Mexico and distributed as follows: PUEBLA,  Tepanaco, 6000 ft., 3, Tehuacan, 5400 ft., 3.

S. Nat. Mus.  (Biol. Surv. Coll.); Colima (City), Colima, Republic of Mexico, obtained  on March 9, 1892, by E. W. Nelson, original number 2055.    _Range._--Southwestern Nayarit and northwestern Jalisco, south into  Colima, thence eastward into Michoacan. Zonal range: part of arid Lower  Tropical Subzone of Goldman (1951:330); approximates part of the  Nayarit-Guerrero Biotic Province of Goldman and Moore (1945:349). Occurs  from near sea level in Colima up to 5800 feet in Jalisco.    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; dorsum Olive-Brown in darkest  series to Buffy Brown with tones of Fawn Color in the palest series;  guard hairs of dorsum black-tipped, gray basally (in some specimens,  guard hairs gray-tipped with subterminal black band, and gray base);  underfur of dorsum black-tipped with subterminal band of fawn to buff,  Neutral Gray basally; face and head paler than back because of greater  number of fawn-colored and buff-colored hairs; hairs on throat and chin  white to base; venter and flanks Pale Olive-Buff in palest series to  Gray (Pale Gull Gray) in darkest series; individual hairs of venter  tipped with white to buff, basally Gray (Dark Gull Gray); forefeet and  hind feet white to gray with flesh-colored undertones; tail faintly  bicolored, individual hairs above black, below white; nasals flared  anteriorly; zygoma and zygomatic plate thick. Average and extreme  external and cranial measurements for 8 adults from Armeria, Colima, are  as follows: total length, 125.5 (115-135); length of tail vertebrae,  47.5 (42-54); length of body, 75.6 (68-81); length of hind foot, 16.5  (16-17); occipitonasal length, 20.3 (19.8-20.7); zygomatic breadth, 10.7  (10.3-11.1); postpalatal length, 7.4 (7.1-7.7); least interorbital  breadth, 4.0 (3.9-4.1); length of incisive foramina, 4.3 (4.1-4.5);  length of rostrum, 7.3 (6.9-7.6); breadth of braincase, 9.8 (9.4-10.0);  depth of cranium, 7.1 (6.7-7.2); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,  3.4 (3.3-3.6); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_e_, and Plate 3_e_.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. brunneus_, _B. m.  infernatis_, and _B. m. pallidus_, see accounts of those subspecies.  From _B. m. nigrescens_, _B. m. musculus_ differs in: dorsum paler  throughout (less of blackish brown); region of face and ears paler, more  buff and fawn-colored hairs rather than blackish-brown to grayish hairs;  vibrissae paler; venter paler, less dark gray and less of sooty-colored  undertones, tips of hairs whitish to pale Olive-Buff rather than light  gray at tips becoming darker basally; forefeet and hind feet paler,  whitish to pale buff-color with flesh-colored undertones, not  sooty-colored to dark brown; tail paler below; nasals flaring outward,  not tapering toward midline at anteriormost point; zygoma more massive;  larger in external and cranial dimensions.    _Remarks._--Merriam (1892:170) described _Sitomys_ [= _Baiomys_]  _musculus_ on the basis of 23 specimens (from Colima City, Colima;  Armeria, Colima; Plantinar, and Zapotlan, Jalisco). According to the  original description, _B. musculus_ resembled a small house mouse and  was smaller than any known species of _Sitomys_ except _S. taylori_ [=  _Baiomys taylori_]. From _taylori_, _musculus_ differed in being larger  [in size of body], and in having longer ears and tail, and larger hind  feet. When Allen and Chapman (1897:203) described _Peromyscus_ [=  _Baiomys_] _musculus brunneus_ from Jalapa, Veracruz, the specimens  described by Merriam from Colima and Jalisco became representative of  the nominal subspecies _B. m. musculus_. Osgood (1909:258) assigned  specimens from Colima, Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacan, Morelos, Oaxaca,  Puebla, Sinaloa, Veracruz, and Zacatecas to the subspecies _musculus_.  Subsequently, Russell (1952:21) named the subspecies _pallidus_ from the  arid lowlands of Morelos; Hooper (1952:96) described the subspecies  _infernatis_ from northern Oaxaca and southeastern Puebla; and Goodwin  (1959:1) described a new subspecies _nebulosus_ from the Oaxaca  highlands. Each of the subspecies mentioned immediately above was  described from within the geographic range assigned to _B. m. musculus_  by Osgood (_loc. cit._). Hall and Kelson (1959:661) mapped the range of  _B. m. musculus_ so as to include Colima, parts of Jalisco, Michoacan,  Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. Lukens (1955:159), in a study of the  mammals of Guerrero, has shown that the characters attributed to _B. m.  pallidus_ are not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#11)"],[1,"at which short exposure produces irreparable  damage, and death inevitably results. These classifications are modified  somewhat by seasonal or laboratory acclimation or by the physiological  state of the animal. The C. T. M. of five cottonmouths was determined by  placing each individual in an enclosed area and heating it with an  infrared lamp. Cloacal temperatures were taken with a Schultheis  quick-recording thermometer as soon as the snake could no longer right  itself when placed on its back. All temperatures were in degrees  Celcius. The C. T. M. averaged 39.2 deg. (38.0 deg. to 40.0 deg.). A temperature of  38.0 deg. was lethal to one individual. These cottonmouths had been in  captivity for nine months. The behavior of the snakes during heating  resembled those instances described by Klauber (1956:382-387) for  rattlesnakes. As the body temperature of the snakes rose past the  optimum, each individual became disturbed and tried to escape from the  enclosure. The snakes soon became frantic in their efforts to escape.  After about five minutes the mouth was opened and heavy, slow breathing  was begun, accompanied by a loss of coordination and a slowing down of  movements. The snakes writhed spasmodically for a few seconds and then  lay still, usually with the mouth open. Recovery was begun by rolling on  the belly and flicking the tongue, followed by movements of the head and  then the body. Cottonmouths are rarely exposed to dangerously high  temperatures owing to their semi-aquatic habits, but there are probably  occasions when individuals reach the C. T. M. for the species.      Basking    Since activity, digestion, and gestation depend upon adequate internal  temperatures, there must be a process by which these temperatures are  attained and for an appropriate time maintained. Basking is important in  this respect. The cottonmouths prefer to lie in a coiled position and,  during basking, can usually be found beside bodies of water or on  branches of dead trees overhanging the water. They are good climbers and  have a prehensile tail that is frequently employed in descending from  small branches. Since cottonmouths are semi-aquatic and are often  exposed to temperatures that are lower than those of the air, they  either must bask more often than terrestrial snakes or tolerate lower  temperatures. Length of the period of basking is determined not only by  amounts of insolation and temperature but also by the size of the snake.  A smaller snake can reach its optimum temperature more rapidly because  of a higher surface-to-volume ratio. Another factor that may play a  minor role in the rate of temperature change is the color of the snake.  The wide variation in color of cottonmouths probably affects rates of  heat increase and loss due to direct radiation. Slight hormonal control  of melanophores described in snakes by Neill and Allen (1955) also may  exert some influence on the length of time spent basking. No rates of  temperature increase or decrease are available for cottonmouths.      Coiling    While inactive the cottonmouth spends most of its time lying in a coiled  position with the tail outermost, with the body usually wound into about  one and one-half cycles, and the head and neck in a reversed direction  forming a U- or S-shaped loop. From this position the snake is able to  make a short strike or a hasty getaway if necessary. In my opinion this  position is used primarily for basking or resting and only secondarily  for feeding. Most individuals appear to pursue their prey actively, not  lying in ambush for the approaching prey to the extent that most other  crotalids do.    Many of the cottonmouths that I kept in captivity were observed in a  coiled position for periods up to three or four days. Under natural  conditions, however, they are more active. Young cottonmouths are  inclined to remain in a coiled position for longer periods than older  individuals.      Locomotion    Four distinct types of locomotion have been described in snakes:  horizontal undulatory, rectilinear, sidewinding, and concertina  (Klauber, 1956: 331-350). Most snakes are capable of employing two or  more of these types of progression, at least to a certain degree; but  horizontal undulatory locomotion is the most common method used by the  majority of snakes, including the cottonmouth. In this method the  snake's body is thrown into lateral undulations that conform with  irregularities in the substrate. Pressure is exerted on the outside and  posterior surface of each curve, thus forcing the body forward.    Rectilinear locomotion is more useful to large, thick-bodied snakes  which use this method of progression, chiefly when they are prowling and  unhurried. This method depends upon the movement of alternate sections  of the venter forward and drawing the body over the ventral scales  resting on the substratum by means of muscular action. This mode of  locomotion was most frequently observed in captive cottonmouths when  they were crawling along the edge of their cages, especially when they  were first introduced to the cages and toward the end of the shedding  process. The other two types of locomotion, sidewinding and concertina,  have not, to my knowledge, been observed in the cottonmouth.    Both the cottonmouth and the cantil have definite affinities for water  and are as likely to be found in water as out of it. Copperheads and  rattlesnakes, although not aquatic, are good swimmers. When swimming, a  motion resembling horizontal undulatory progression is used.      Disposition    The number of different opinions expressed in the literature concerning  the cottonmouth's disposition is not at all surprising. As with any  species there is a wide range of individual temperament, which is  affected by many factors. The cottonmouth is considered by some writers  to be docile while others consider it to be highly dangerous. Allen and  Swindell (1948:7) described the variability in temperament, even among  individuals. They wrote: \"On rare occasions, moccasins are found which  will attack. A perfectly docile snake will turn and bite viciously  without any apparent reason.\" They also recounted a case in which a  cottonmouth was kept as a pet for six years, being allowed the freedom  of the house. Smith and List (1955:123) found them \"... surprisingly  docile in the gulf region [Mississippi], displaying none of the  pugnacity of more northern cottonmouths.\" Smith (1956:310) stated:  \"Unlike the copperhead, cottonmouths are pugnacious; their powerful  jaws, long fangs, vicious disposition and potent venom make them a very  dangerous animal.\"    My own observations are in general agreement with the statements of  Allen and Swindell (_loc. cit._). In my encounters with cottonmouths, I  have never found any aggressive individuals except for three juveniles  that were born in captivity. In their first three days in the laboratory  these juveniles were observed to strike repeatedly whenever anyone  entered the room. After this short period of aggressiveness, however,  they slowly became more docile. The disposition shown by the newborn  young is clearly an innate behavioral pattern that undoubtedly has a  direct relationship to survival. The majority of cottonmouths that I  have approached in the field have moved swiftly to seek refuge in nearby  water; a few have remained motionless as I approached, and one showed  the typical threat display. Upon capture and handling, they react  similarly to other pit-vipers by opening and closing the mouth and  erecting the fangs in an attempt to bite. They often bite through the  lower jaw and eject venom at this time as well as when the mouth is  open. Of more than a dozen individuals kept in captivity, four were  particularly difficult to handle whereas another was extremely docile.  It was almost never found in aggregations with the other snakes and did  not struggle or attempt to bite when handled. The majority remained  unpredictable in disposition, usually appearing docile and lazy but  capable of extremely rapid movements when disturbed.      Defense and Escape    The typical threatening posture of rattlesnakes is all but lacking in  the cottonmouth, which relies primarily on concealing coloration or  nearness to water for escape. When approached, it usually plunges into  nearby water or remains motionless with the head held up at a 45 deg. angle  and the mouth opened widely exposing the white interior. The tail is  sometimes vibrated rapidly and musk is expelled. This threat display is  unique to cottonmouths; although it does not attract as much attention  as the display of rattlesnakes, it is probably an effective warning to  most intruders at close range.    Neill (1947:205) reported one case in which a cottonmouth used the \"body  blow\" defense, described for _Crotalus_ by Cowles (1938:13), when  approached by a king-snake, _Lampropeltis getulus_. In this unusual  posture the anterior and posterior portions of the body are held against  the ground and the middle one-fourth to one-third of the body is lifted  up and used in striking the intruder. This same defense posture also was  observed in rattlesnakes when presented with the odor of the spotted  skunk, _Spilogale phenax_. However, the \"king-snake defense posture\" is  probably not a well-established behavioral pattern in the cottonmouth,  for it sometimes feeds upon king-snakes. I observed the killing and  devouring of a cottonmouth by a speckled king-snake, _L. g. holbrooki_;  the only attempts to escape were by rapid crawling and biting.    Cottonmouths often squirt musk as a defensive action. The tail is  switched back and forth, and musk is emitted from glands on each side of  the base of the tail. The fine jets of musk are sprayed upward at about  45 deg. angles for a distance of nearly five feet. How often this defense  mechanism is used against other animals is not known, but the musky odor  can"]]]
