After  founding and conducting several musical societies, he became in 1821  director of the then opened Conservatorium, at the head of which he  continued to the end of its existence in 1830. To complete the idea of  the man, we must not omit to mention his essay In how far is the Polish  language suitable for music? As few of his compositions have been heard  outside of Poland, and these few long ago, rarely, and in few places, it  is difficult to form a satisfactory opinion with regard to his position  as a composer. Most accounts, however, agree in stating that he wrote in  the style of the modern Italians, that is to say, what were called the  modern Italians in the later part of the last and the earlier part of  this century. Elsner tried his strength and ability in all genres, from  oratorio, opera, and symphony, down to pianoforte variations, rondos,  and dances, and in none of them did he fail to be pleasing and  intelligible, not even where, as especially in his sacred music, he  made use--a sparing use--of contrapuntal devices, imitations, and fugal  treatment. The naturalness, fluency, effectiveness, and practicableness  which distinguish his writing for voices and instruments show that he  possessed a thorough knowledge of their nature and capability. It was,  therefore, not an empty rhetorical phrase to speak of him initiating  his pupils \"a la science du contre-point et aux effets d'une savante  instrumentation.\"    [FOOTNOTE: \"The productions of Elsner,\" says Fetis, \"are in the style of  Paer and Mayer's music. In his church music there is a little too much  of modern and dramatic forms; one finds in them facility and a natural  manner of making the parts sing, but little originality and variety in  his ideas. Elsner writes with sufficient purity, although he shows in  his fugues that his studies have not been severe.\"]    For the pupils of the Conservatorium he wrote vocal pieces in from one  to ten parts, and he composed also a number of canons in four and five  parts, which fact seems to demonstrate that he had no ill-will against  the scholastic forms. And now I shall quote a passage from an apparently  well-informed writer [FOOTNOTE: The writer of the article Elsner in  Schilling's Universal-Lexikon der Tonkunst] (to whom I am, moreover,  otherwise indebted in this sketch), wherein Elsner is blamed for certain  shortcomings with which Chopin has been often reproached in a less  charitable spirit. The italics, which are mine, will point out the words  in question:--       One forgives him readily [in consideration of the general     excellence of his style] THE OFFENCES AGAINST THE LAW OF     HARMONIC CONNECTION THAT OCCUR HERE AND THERE, AND THE     FACILITY WITH WHICH HE SOMETIMES DISREGARDS THE FIXED RULES     OF STRICT PART-WRITING, especially in the dramatic works,     where he makes effect apparently the ultimate aim of his     indefatigable endeavours.    The wealth of melody and technical mastery displayed in \"The Passion  of our Lord Jesus Christ\" incline Karasowski to think that it is the  composer's best work. When the people at Breslau praised Elsner's  \"Echo Variations\" for orchestra, Chopin exclaimed: \"You must hear his  Coronation Mass, then only can you judge of him as a composer.\" To  characterise Elsner in a few words, he was a man of considerable musical  aptitude and capacity, full of nobleness of purpose, learning, industry,  perseverance, in short, possessing all qualities implied by talent, but  lacking those implied by genius.    A musician travelling in 1841 in Poland sent at the time to the Neue  Zeitschrift fur Musik a series of \"Reiseblatter\" (Notes of Travel),  which contain so charming and vivid a description of this interesting  personality that I cannot resist the temptation to translate and insert  it here almost without any abridgment. Two noteworthy opinions of the  writer may be fitly prefixed to this quotation--namely, that Elsner was  a Pole with all his heart and soul, indeed, a better one than thousands  that are natives of the country, and that, like Haydn, he possessed the  quality of writing better the older he grew:--       The first musical person of the town [Warsaw] is still the     old, youthful Joseph Elsner, a veteran master of our art, who     is as amiable as he is truly estimable. In our day one hardly     meets with a notable Polish musician who has not studied     composition under Pan [i.e., Mr.] Elsner; and he loves all     his pupils, and all speak of him with enthusiasm, and,     according to the Polish fashion, kiss the old master's     shoulder, whereupon he never forgets to kiss them heartily on     both cheeks. Even Charles Kurpinski, the pensioned     Capelhneister of the Polish National Theatre, whose hair is     already grey, is, if I am not very much misinformed, also a     pupil of Joseph Elsner's. One is often mistaken with regard     to the outward appearance of a celebrated man; I mean, one     forms often a false idea of him before one has seen him and     knows a portrait of him. I found Elsner almost exactly as I     had imagined him. Wisocki, the pianist, also a pupil of his,     took me to him. Pan Elsner lives in the Dom Pyarow [House of     Piarists]. One has to start early if one wishes to find him     at home; for soon after breakfast he goes out, and rarely     returns to his cell before evening. He inhabits, like a     genuine church composer, two cells of the old Piarist     Monastery in Jesuit Street, and in the dark passages which     lead to his rooms one sees here and there faded laid-aside     pictures of saints lying about, and old church banners     hanging down. The old gentleman was still in bed when we     arrived, and sent his servant to ask us to wait a little in     the anteroom, promising to be with us immediately. All the     walls of this room, or rather cell, were hung to the ceiling     with portraits of musicians, among them some very rare names     and faces. Mr. Elsner has continued this collection down to     the present time; also the portraits of Liszt, Thalberg,     Chopin, and Clara Wieck shine down from the old monastic     walls. I had scarcely looked about me in this large company     for a few minutes, when the door of the adjoining room     opened, and a man of medium height (not to say little),     somewhat stout, with a round, friendly countenance, grey     hair, but very lively eyes, enveloped in a warm fur dressing-     gown, stepped up to us, comfortably but quickly, and bade us     welcome. Wisocki kissed him, according to the Polish fashion,     as a token of respect, on the right shoulder, and introduced     me to him, whereupon the old friendly gentleman shook hands     with me and said some kindly words.       This, then, was Pan Joseph Elsner, the ancestor of modern     Polish music, the teacher of Chopin, the fine connoisseur and     cautious guide of original talents. For he does not do as is     done only too often by other teachers in the arts, who insist     on screwing all pupils to the same turning-lathe on which     they themselves were formed, who always do their utmost to     ingraft their own I on the pupil, so that he may become as     excellent a man as they imagine themselves to be. Joseph     Elsner did not proceed thus. When all the people of Warsaw     thought Frederick Chopin was entering on a wrong path, that     his was not music at all, that he must keep to Himmel and     Hummel, otherwise he would never do anything decent--the     clever Pan Elsner had already very clearly perceived what a     poetic kernel there was in the pale young dreamer, had long     before felt very clearly that he had before him the founder     of a new epoch of pianoforte-playing, and was far from laying     upon him a cavesson, knowing well that such a noble     thoroughbred may indeed be cautiously led, but must not be     trained and fettered in the usual way if he is to conquer.    Of Chopin's studies under this master we do not know much more than  of his studies under Zywny. Both Fontana and Sowinski say that he went  through a complete course of counterpoint and composition. Elsner, in a  letter written to Chopin in 1834, speaks of himself as \"your teacher  of harmony and counterpoint, of little merit, but fortunate.\" Liszt  writes:--       Joseph Elsner taught Chopin those things that are most     difficult to learn and most rarely known: to be exacting     to one's self, and to value the advantages that are only     obtained by dint of patience and labour.    What other accounts of the matter under discussion I have got from books  and conversations are as general and vague as the foregoing. I therefore  shall not weary the reader with them. What Elsner's view of teaching was  may be gathered from one of his letters to his pupil. The gist of his  remarks lies in this sentence:--       That with which the artist (who learns continually from his     surroundings) astonishes his contemporaries, he can only     attain by himself and through himself.    Elsner had insight and self-negation (a rare quality with teachers)  enough to act up to his theory, and give free play to the natural  tendencies of his pupil's powers. That this was really the case is seen  from his reply to one who blamed Frederick's disregard of rules and  custom:--       Leave him in peace [he said], his is an uncommon way because     his gifts are uncommon. He does not strictly adhere to the     customary method, but he has one of his own, and he will     reveal in his works an originality which in such a degree has     not been found in anyone.    The letters of master and pupil testify to their unceasing mutual esteem  and love. Those of the master are full of fatherly affection and advice,  those of the pupil full of filial devotion and reverence."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4974"],[0,"Australia Twice Traversed (#11)"],[1,"opposite bank, for under it was a long reach of water,  and a quagmire extending for more than a mile on either side. Two of  our riding-horses were badly bogged in trying to find a get-away:  finally, we had to cut boughs and sticks, and bridge the place over  with them. Thus we eventually got the horses over one by one without  accident or loss. In four miles we touched on a bend of the river  again, but had no occasion to recross, as it was not in our road. This  day, having wasted so much time in the crossings, we travelled only  fifteen miles. The horizon from this camp was bounded from south-west,  and west, round by north, to north-west, by ranges; which I was not  sorry to perceive. Those to the west, and south-west, were the highest  and most pointed. It appears that the Finke must come under or through  some of those to the north-west. To-day I observed a most beautiful  pigeon, quite new to me; it was of a dark-brown colour, mottled under  the throat and on the breast; it had also a high top-knot. It is  considerably smaller than the Sturt pigeon of his Central Australian  expedition.    It was now the 28th of August, and the temperature of the atmosphere  was getting warmer. Journeying now again about north-west, we reached  a peculiar pointed hill with the Finke at its foot. We passed over the  usual red sandhill country covered with the porcupine grass,  characteristic of the Finke country, and saw a shallow sheet of yellow  rain water in a large clay pan, which is quite an unusual feature in  this part of the world, clay being so conspicuous by its absence. The  hill, when we reached it, assumed the appearance of a high pinnacle;  broken fragments of rock upon its sides and summit showed it too rough  and precipitous to climb with any degree of pleasure. I named it  Christopher's Pinnacle, after a namesake of mine. The range behind it  I named Chandler's Range. For some miles we had seen very little  porcupine grass, but here we came into it again, to the manifest  disgust of our horses. We had now a line of hills on our right, with  the river on our left hand, and in six or seven miles came to the west  end of Chandler's Range, and could see to the north and north-west  another, and much higher the line running parallel to Chandler's  Range, but extending to the west as far as I could see. The country  hereabouts has been nearly all burnt by the natives, and the horses  endeavour to pick roads where the dreaded triodia has been destroyed.    We passed a few clumps of casuarinas and a few stunted trees with  broad, poplar-like leaves. Travelling for twelve miles on this  bearing, we struck the Finke again, running nearly north and south.  Here the river had a stony bed with a fine reach of water in it; so  to-night at least our anxiety as regards the horses bogging is at an  end. The stream purling over its stony floor produces a most agreeable  sound, such as I have not heard for many a day. Here I might say,  \"Brightly the brook through the green leaflets, giddy with joyousness,  dances along.\"    Soon after we had unpacked and let go our horses, we were accosted by  a native on the opposite side of the creek. Our little dog became  furious; then two natives appeared. We made an attempt at a long  conversation, but signally failed, for neither of us knew many of the  words the other was saying. The only bit of information I obtained  from them was their name for the river--as they kept continually  pointing to it and repeating the word Larapinta. This word, among the  Peake and Charlotte natives, means a snake, and from the continual  serpentine windings of this peculiar and only Central Australian  river, no doubt the name is derived. I shot a hawk for them, and they  departed. The weather to-day was fine, with agreeable cool breezes;  the sky has become rather overcast; the flies are very numerous and  troublesome; and it seems probable we may have a slight fall of rain  before long.    A few drops of rain fell during the night, which made me regret that I  had not our tarpaulins erected, though no more fell. In the morning  there was sultriness in the air though the sky was clear; the  thermometer stood at 52 degrees, and at sunrise a smoky haze pervaded  the whole sky. Whilst we were packing up the horses this morning, the  same two natives whom we saw last night, again made their appearance,  bringing with them a third, who was painted, feathered, greased, and  red-ochred, in, as they doubtless thought, the most alarming manner. I  had just mounted my horse, and rode towards them, thinking to get some  more information from the warrior as to the course of the creek, etc.,  but when they saw the horse approaching they scampered off, and the  bedizened warrior projected himself into the friendly branches of the  nearest tree with the most astonishing velocity. Perceiving that it  was useless to try to approach them, without actually running them to  earth, we left them; and crossing the river easily over its stony bed,  we continued north-west towards a mountain in the ranges that  traversed the horizon in that direction. The river appeared to come  from the same spot. A breeze from the north-west caused the dust  raised by the pack-horses, which we drove in a mob before us,  travelling upon the loose soil where the spinifex had all been lately  burnt, to blow directly in our faces. At five miles we struck on a  bend of a river, and we saw great volumes of smoke from burning grass  and triodia rising in all directions. The natives find it easier to  catch game when the ground is bare, or covered only with a short  vegetation, than when it is clothed with thick coarse grasses or  pungent shrubs. A tributary from the north, or east of north, joined  the Finke on this course, but it was destitute of water at the  junction. Soon now the river swept round to the westward, along the  foot of the hills we were approaching. Here a tributary from the west  joined, having a slender stream of water running along its bed. It was  exceedingly boggy, and we had to pass up along it for over two miles  before we could find a place to cross to enable us to reach the main  stream, now to the north of us. I called this McMinn's Creek.    On reaching the Finke we encamped. In the evening I ascended a  mountain to the north-westward of us. It was very rough, stony, and  precipitous, and composed of red sandstone; its summit was some 800  feet above our camp. It had little other vegetation upon it than huge  plots of triodia, of the most beautiful and vivid green, and set with  the most formidable spines. Whenever one moves, these spines enter the  clothes in all directions, making it quite a torture to walk about  among them. From here I could see that the Finke turned up towards  these hills through a glen, in a north-westerly direction. Other  mountains appeared to the north and north-west; indeed this seemed to  be a range of mountains of great length and breadth. To the eastwards  it may stretch to the telegraph line, and to the west as far as the  eye could see. The sun had gone down before I had finished taking  bearings. Our road to-morrow will be up through the glen from which  the river issues. All day a most objectionable hot wind has been  blowing, and clouds of smoke and ashes from the fires, and masses of  dust from the loose soil ploughed up by the horses in front of us, and  blowing in our faces, made it one of the most disagreeable days I ever  passed. At night, however, a contrast obtained--the wind dropped, and  a calm, clear, and beautiful night succeeded to the hot, smoky, and  dusty day. Vega alone gave me my latitude here, close to the mouth of  the glen, as 24 degrees 25' 12\"; and, though the day had been so hot  and disagreeable, the night proved cold and chilly, the thermometer  falling to 24 degrees by daylight, but there was no frost, or even any  dew to freeze.

Our start this morning was late, some of our horses having wandered in  the night, the feed at the camp not being very good; indeed the only  green herb met by us, for some considerable distance, has been the sow  or milk thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), which grows to a considerable  height. Of this the horses are extremely fond: it is also very  fattening. Entering the mouth of the glen, in two miles we found  ourselves fairly enclosed by the hills, which shut in the river on  both sides. We had to follow the windings of the serpentine channel;  the mountains occasionally forming steep precipices overhanging the  stream, first upon one side, then upon the other. We often had to lead  the horses separately over huge ledges of rock, and frequently had to  cut saplings and lever them out of the way, continually crossing and  recrossing the river. On camping in the glen we had only made good  eleven miles, though to accomplish this we had travelled more than  double the distance. At the camp a branch creek came out of the  mountains to the westwards, which I named Phillip's Creek. The whole  of this line of ranges is composed of red sandstone in large or small  fragments, piled up into the most grotesque shapes. Here and there"]]]
