The  legislature was in session and he was a member of the Senate. He knew  all the circumstances of my case, and was present at my trial. After the  first salutation, he laughingly said:    \"Well, Doctor, those are not quite as nice clothes as I used to furnish  you with.\"    \"No,\" I replied, \"but perhaps they are more durable.\"    After some other chaff and chat, he made me tell him all about my first  marriage and subsequent separation, and after talking awhile he went  away, promising to see me soon. I looked upon this only as a friendly  visit, for which I was grateful; and attached no great importance to it.  But he came again in a few days, and after some general conversation, he  told me that there was a movement on foot in my favor, which might bring  the best of news to me; that he had not only talked with his friends in  the legislature, and enlisted their sympathy and assistance, but he had  laid the whole circumstances, from beginning to end, before Governor  Price; that the Governor would visit the prison shortly, and then I must  do my best in pleading my own cause.    In a day or two the Governor came, and I had an opportunity to relate  my story. I told him all about my first unfortunate marriage, and the  separation. He said that he knew the facts, and also that he had lately  received a letter from my oldest son on the subject, and had read it  with great interest. I then appealed to the Governor for his clemency;  my sentence was an outrageously severe one, and seemed almost prompted  by private malice; I implored him to pardon me; I went down on my knees  before him, and asked his mercy. He told me to be encouraged; that he  would be in the prison again in a few days, and he would see me. He then  went away.    I at once drew up a petition which my friend in the Senate circulated  in the legislature for signatures, and afterwards sent it to Newark,  securing some of the best names in that city. It was then returned to  me, and two weeks afterwards when the Governor came again to the prison  I presented it to him, and he put it in his pocket.    In two days' time, Governor Price sent my pardon into the prison. The  Warden came and told me of it, and said he would let me out in an hour.  Then came a keeper who once more put the cap over my face and led me  around the interior--I was willingly led now--till he brought me to a  room where he gave me my own clothes which I put on, and with a kind  parting word, and five dollars from the Warden, I was soon in the  street, once more a free man. My sentence of ten years had been  fulfilled by an imprisonment of exactly seven months.    I went and called on Governor Price to thank him for his great goodness  towards me. He received me kindly, talked to me for some time, and gave  me some good advice and a little money. With this and the five dollars I  received from the Warden of the prison I started for New York.        CHAPTER VII. ON THE KEEN SCENT.

It would seem as if, by this time, I had had enough of miscellaneous  marrying and the imprisonment that almost invariably followed. I had  told Governor Price, when I first implored him for pardon, that if he  would release me I would begin a new life, and endeavor to be in all  respects a better man. I honestly meant to make every effort to be so,  and on my stay to New York I made numberless vows for my own future  good behavior. I bound myself over, as it were, to keep the pace--my own  peace and quiet especially--and became my own surety. That I could not  have had a poorer bondsman, subsequent events proved to my sorrow. But I  started fairly, and meant to let liquor alone; to attend strictly to my  medical business, which I always managed to make profitable, and above  all, to have nothing to do with women in the love-making or matrimonial  way.    With those good resolutions I arrived in New York and went to my old  hotel in Courtland Street, where I was well known and was well received.  My trunk, which I had left there sixteen months before, was safe, and  I had a good suit of clothes on my back--the clothes I took off when  I went to prison in Trenton--and which were returned to me when I came  away. I went to a friend who loaned me some money, and I remained two or  three days in town to try my new-found freedom, going about the city,  visiting places of amusement, enjoying myself very much, and keeping, so  far, the good resolutions I had formed.    From New York I went to Troy, and at the hotel where I stopped I became  acquainted with a woman who told me that her husband was in the Insane  Asylum at Brattleboro, Vt. She was going to see him, and if he was fit  to be removed, she proposed to take him home, with her. I told her  of the success I had had in taking care of two men at Newbury and  Montgomery; and how I had traveled about the country with them, and with  the most beneficial results to my patients. She was much interested,  inquired into the particulars, and finally thought the plan would be a  favorable one for her husband. She asked me to go with her to see him,  and said that if he was in condition to travel he should go about with  me if he would; at any rate, if he came out of the Asylum she would put  him under my care. We went together to Brattleboro, and the very day we  arrived her husband was taken in an apoplectic fit from which he did not  recover. She carried home his corpse, and I lost my expected patient.    But I must have something to do for my daily support, and so I went to  work and very soon sold some medicines and recipes, and secured a few  patients. I also visited the adjoining villages, and in a few weeks  I had a very good practice. I might have lived here quietly and made  money. Nobody knew anything of my former history, my marriages or my  misfortunes, and I was doing well, with a daily increasing business.  And so I went on for nearly three months, gaining new acquaintances, and  extending my practice every day.    Then came the old tempter in a new form, and my matrimonial monomania,  which I hoped was cured forever, broke out afresh. One day, at the  public house where I lived, I saw a fine girl from New Hampshire, with  whom I became acquainted--so easily, so far as she was concerned--that I  ought to have been warned to have nothing to do with her; but, as usual,  in such cases, my common sense left me, and I was infatuated enough to  fancy that I was in love.    Mary Gordon was the daughter of a farmer living near Keene, N. H., and  was a handsome girl about twenty years of age. She was going, she told  me, to visit some friends in Bennington, and would be there about a  month, during which time, if I was in that vicinity, she hoped I would  come and see her. We parted very lovingly, and when she had been in  Bennington a few days she wrote to me, setting a time for me to visit  her; but in business in Brattleboro was too good to leave, and I so  wrote to her. Whereupon, in another week, she came back to Brattleboro  and proposed to finish the remainder of her visit there, thus blinding  her friends at home who would think she was all the while at Bennington.    Our brief acquaintance when she was at the house before, attracted no  particular attention, and when she came now I told the landlord that she  was my cousin, and he gave her a room and I paid her bills. The cousin  business was a full cover to our intimacy; she sat next to me at the  table, rode about with me to see my patients, and when I went to places  near by to sell medicine, and we were almost constantly together. Of  course, we were engaged to be married, and that very soon.    In a fortnight after her arrival I went home with her to her father's  farm near Keene, and she told her mother that we were \"engaged.\" The old  folks thought they would like to know me a little better, but she said  we were old friends, she knew me thoroughly, and meant to marry me.  There was no further objection on the part of her parents, and in the  few days following she and her mother were busily engaged in preparing  her clothes and outfit.    I then announced my intention of returning to Brattleboro to settle up  my business in that place, and she declared she would go with me; I  was sure to be lonesome; she might help me about my bills, and so on.  Strange as it may seem, her parents made no objection to her going,  though I was to be absent a fortnight, and was not to be married till  I came back. So we went together, and I and my \"cousin\" put up at the  hotel we had lately left. For two weeks I was busy in making my final  visits to my patients acquaintances, she generally going with me every  day.    At the end of that time we went back to Keene, and in three weeks we  were married in her father's house, the old folks making a great wedding  for us, which was attended by all the neighbors and friends of the  family. We stayed at home two weeks, and meanwhile arranged our plans  for the future. We proposed to go out to Ohio, where she had some  relatives, and settle down. She had seven hundred dollars in bank in  Keene which she drew, and we started on our journey. We went to Troy,  where we stayed a few days, and during that time we both concluded that  we would not go West, but return to Keene and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4671"],[0,"The Story of the Pony Express (#11)"],[1,"to  Kelley's story, their feet were swollen so as to resemble \"hams.\"    They next erected a fort at Sand Springs, twenty miles from Carson Lake,  and another at Cold Springs, thirty-two miles east of Sand Springs. At  Cold Springs, Kelley was appointed assistant station-keeper under Jim  McNaughton. An outbreak of the Pah-Ute Indians was now in progress, and  as the little station was in the midst of the disturbed area, there was  plenty of excitement.    One night while Kelley was on guard his attention was attracted by the  uneasiness of the horses. Gazing carefully through the dim light, he saw  an Indian peering over the outer wall or stockade. The orders of the  post were to shoot every Indian that came within range, so Kelley blazed  away, but missed his man. In the morning, many tracks were found about  the place. This wild shot had probably frightened the prowlers away,  saving the station from attack, and certain destruction.    During this same morning, a Mexican pony rider came in, mortally  wounded, having been shot by the savages from ambush while passing  through a dense thicket in the vicinity known as Quaking Asp Bottom.  Although given tender care, the poor fellow died within a few hours  after his arrival. The mail was waiting and it must go. Kelley, who was  the lightest man in in the place--he weighed but one hundred pounds--was  now ordered by the boss to take the dead man's place, and go on with  the dispatches. This he did, finishing the run without further incident.  On his return trip he had to pass once more through the aspen thicket  where his predecessor had received his death wound. This was one of the  most dangerous points on the entire trail, for the road zigzagged  through a jungle, following a passage-way that was only large enough to  admit a horse and rider; for two miles a man could not see more than  thirty or forty feet ahead. Kelley was expecting trouble, and went  through like a whirlwind, at the same time holding a repeating rifle in  readiness should trouble occur. On having cleared the thicket, he drew  rein on the top of a hill, and, looking back over his course, saw the  bushes moving in a suspicious manner. Knowing there was no live stock in  that locality and that wild game rarely abounded there, he sent several  shots in the direction of the moving underbrush. The motion soon ceased,  and he galloped onward, unharmed.    A few days later, two United States soldiers, while traveling to join  their command, were ambushed and murdered in the same thicket.    This was about the time when Major Ormsby's command was massacred by the  Utes in the disaster at Pyramid Lake[27], and the Indians everywhere in  Nevada were unusually aggressive and dangerous. There were seldom more  than three or four men in the little station and it is remarkable that  Kelley and his companions were not all killed.    One of Kelley's worst rides, in addition to the episode just related,  was the stretch between Cold Springs and Sand Springs for thirty-seven  miles without a drop of water along the way.    Once, while dashing past a wagon train of immigrants, a whole fusillade  of bullets was fired at Kelley who narrowly escaped with his life. Of  course he could not stop the mail to see why he had been shot at, but on  his return trip he met the same crowd, and in unprintable language told  them what he thought of their lawless and irresponsible conduct. The  only satisfaction he could get from them in reply was the repeated  assertion, \"We thought you was an Indian!\"[28] Nor was Kelley the only  pony rider who took narrow chances from the guns of excited immigrants.  Traveling rapidly and unencumbered, the rider, sunburned and blackened  by exposure, must have borne on first glance no little resemblance to an  Indian; and especially would the mistake be natural to excited wagon-men  who were always in fear of dashing attacks from mounted Indians--attacks  in which a single rider would often be deployed to ride past the  white men at utmost speed in order to draw their fire. Then when their  guns were empty a hidden band of savages would make a furious onslaught.  It was the established rule of the West in those days, in case of  suspected danger, to shoot first, and make explanations afterward; to do  to the other fellow as he would do to you, and do it first!    Added to the perils of the wilderness deserts, blizzards, and wild  Indians--the pony riders, then, had at times to beware of their white  friends under such circumstances as have been narrated. And that added  to the tragical romance of their daily lives. Yet they courted danger  and were seldom disappointed, for danger was always near them.        [23] Root and Connelley.    [24] Pony riders often alternated \"runs\" with each other over their  respective divisions in the same manner as do railroad train crews at  the present time.    [25] \"Wild Bill\" Hickock was one of the most noted gun fighters that the  West ever produced. As marshal of Abilene, Kansas, and other wild  frontier towns he became a terror to bad men and compelled them to  respect law and order when under his jurisdiction. Probably no man has  ever equaled him in the use of the six shooter. Numerous magazine  articles describing his career can be found.    [26] Inman & Cody, Salt Lake Trail.    [27] Bancroft.    [28] Indians would sometimes gaze in open-mouthed wonder at the  on-rushing ponies. To some of them, the \"pony outfit\" was \"bad medicine\"  and not to be molested. There was a certain air of mystery about the  wonderful system and untiring energy with which the riders followed  their course. Unfortunately, a majority of the red men were not always  content to watch the Express in simple wonder. They were too frequently  bent upon committing deviltry to refrain from doing harm whenever they  had a chance.          Chapter VII    Anecdotes of the Trail and Honor Roll      No detailed account of the Pony Express would be complete without  mentioning the adventures of Robert Haslam, in those days called \"Pony  Bob,\" and William F. Cody, who is known to fame and posterity as  \"Buffalo Bill.\"    Haslam's banner performance came about in a matter-of-fact way, as is  generally the case with deeds of heroism. On a certain trip during the  Ute raids mentioned in the last chapter, he stopped at Reed's Station on  the Carson River in Nevada, and found no change of horses, since all the  animals had been appropriated by the white men of the vicinity for a  campaign against the Indians. Haslam therefore fed the horse he was  riding, and after a short rest started for Bucklands[29], the next  station which was fifteen miles down the river. He had already ridden  seventy-five miles and was due to lay off at the latter place. But on  arriving, his successor, a man named Johnson Richardson, was unable or  indisposed to go on with the mail[30]. It happened that Division  Superintendent W. C. Marley was at Bucklands when Haslam arrived, and,  since Richardson would not go on duty, Marley offered \"Pony Bob\" fifty  dollars bonus if he would take up the route. Haslam promptly accepted  the proposal, and within ten minutes was off, armed with a revolver and  carbine, on his new journey. He at first had a lonesome ride of  thirty-five miles to the Sink of the Carson. Reaching the place without  mishap, he changed mounts and hurried on for thirty-seven miles over the  alkali wastes and through the sand until he came to Cold Springs. Here  he again changed horses and once more dashed on, this time for thirty  miles without stopping, till Smith's Creek was reached where he was  relieved by J. G. Kelley. \"Bob\" had thus ridden one hundred and  eighty-five miles without stopping except to change mounts. At Smith's  Creek he slept nine hours and then started back with the return mail. On  reaching Cold Springs once more, he found himself in the midst of  tragedy. The Indians had been there. The horses had been stolen. All was  in ruins. Nearby lay the corpse of the faithful station-keeper. Small  cheer for a tired horse and rider! Haslam watered his steed and pounded  ahead without rest or refreshment. Before he had covered half the  distance to the next station, darkness was falling. The journey was  enshrouded with danger. On every side were huge clumps of sage-bush  which would offer excellent chances for savages to lie in ambush. The  howling of wolves added to the dolefulness of the trip. And haunting him  continuously was the thought of the ruined little station and the  stiffened corpse behind him. But pony riders were men of courage and  nerve, and Bob was no exception. He arrived at Sand Springs safely; but  here there was to be no rest nor delay. After reporting the outrage he  had just seen, he advised the station man of his danger, and, after  changing horses, induced the latter to accompany him on to the Sink of  the Carson, which move doubtless saved the latter's life. Reaching the  Carson, they found a badly frightened lot of men who had been attacked  by the Indians only a few hours previously. A party of fifteen with  plenty of arms and ammunition had gathered in the adobe station, which  was large enough also to accommodate as, many horses. Nearby was a cool  spring of water, and, thus fortified, they were to remain, in a state of  siege, if necessary, until the marauders withdrew from that vicinity. Of  course they implored Haslam to remain with them and not risk his life  venturing away with the mail. But the mail must go; and the schedule,  hard as it was, must be maintained. \"Bob\" had no conception of fear, and  so he galloped away, after an hour's rest. And back into Bucklands he  came unharmed, after having suffered only three and a half hours of  delay. Superintendent Marley, who was still present when the daring  rider returned, at once raised his bonus from fifty to one hundred  dollars.    Nor was this all of Haslam's great achievement.
