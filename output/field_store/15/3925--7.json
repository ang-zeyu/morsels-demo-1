When he reached California he could buy  an interest in a mine, and perhaps within three or four years he could  return home twenty times as rich as his father. It was pleasant to think  over all this, and almost to persuade himself that the good luck had  actually come. However, he must wait a few days, for the ticket had not  yet come, and the lottery would not be drawn for a week.    The ticket arrived two days later; Eben took care to slip the envelope  into his pocket without letting his father or anyone else see it, for  unpleasant questions might have been asked as to where he got the money  that paid for it, Mr. Graham knowing very well that his son had not five  dollars by him.    For a few days Eben must remain in Wayneboro, until the lottery was  drawn. If he was unlucky, he would have to consider some other plan for  raising money to get away from Wayneboro.    It was not till the day after the trial and his triumphant acquittal,  that Herbert saw Eben. He came to the store to buy some groceries for  his mother.    \"Good-evening, Herbert,\" said Eben.    \"Eben,\" said Herbert, coldly, \"except in the way of business, I don't  want to speak to you.\"    \"You don't bear malice on account of that little affair, do you,  Herbert?\" said Eben, smoothly.    \"That little affair, as you call it, might have been a very serious  affair to me.\"    \"I only did my duty,\" said Eben.    \"Was it your duty to charge an innocent person with theft?\"    \"I didn't see who else could have taken the things,\" said Eben.    \"Probably you know as well as anybody,\" said Herbert, contemptuously.    \"What do you mean?\" demanded Eben, coloring.    \"You know better than I do. How much do I owe you?\"    \"Thirty-three cents.\"    \"There is your money,\" said Herbert, and walked out of the store.    \"I hate that boy!\" said Eben, scowling at Herbert's retreating figure.  \"He puts on too many airs, just because a city man's taken him in  charity and is paying his expenses. Some time I'll be able to come up  with him, I hope.\"    Herbert was not of an unforgiving nature, but he felt that Eben had  wronged him deeply, and saw no reason why he would not repeat the injury  if he ever got the chance. He had at least a partial understanding of  Eben's mean nature and utter selfishness, and felt that he wished to  have nothing to do with him. Ebenezer Graham was very \"close,\" but he  was a hard-working man and honest as the world goes. He was tolerably  respected in Wayneboro, though not popular, but Eben seemed on the high  road to become a rascal.    A week slipped by, and a circular containing the list of prizes drawn  was sent to Eben.    He ran his eyes over it in a flutter of excitement. Alas! for his hopes.  In the list of lucky numbers the number on his ticket was not included.    \"I have drawn a blank! Curse the luck!\" he muttered, savagely. \"The old  man needn't think I am going to stay here in Wayneboro. If he won't give  me money to go out West, why, then--\"    But he did not say what then.          CHAPTER XIV. A TRIP TO BOSTON.        \"To-morrow, Herbert,\" said George Melville, as they parted for the day,  \"I shall propose a new excursion to you.\"    Herbert regarded him inquiringly.    \"I want to go to Boston to make a few purchases, but principally to  consult my physician.\"    \"I hope you are not feeling any worse, Mr. Melville,\" said Herbert, with  genuine concern, for he had come to feel a regard for his employer, who  was always kind and considerate to him.    \"No, I am feeling as well as usual; but I wish to consult Dr. Davies  about the coming winter--whether he would advise me to spend it in  Massachusetts.\"    \"If Mr. Melville goes away, I shall have to look for another place,\"  thought Herbert, soberly. It was hardly likely, he knew, that he would  obtain a position so desirable as the one he now filled.    \"I hope he will be able to do so, Mr. Melville,\" he said, earnestly.    \"I hope so; but I shall not be surprised if the doctor ordered me away.\"    \"Then you won't want me to come to-morrow?\"    \"Certainly, unless you object to going to Boston with me.\"    \"Object?\" repeated Herbert, eagerly. \"I should like nothing better.\"    In fact, our hero, though a well-grown boy of sixteen, had never been to  Boston but three times, and the trip, commonplace as it may seem to  my traveled young readers, promised him a large amount of novelty and  pleasurable excitement.    \"I shall be glad of your company, Herbert. I hardly feel the strength  or enterprise to travel alone, even for so trifling a trip as going to  Boston.\"    \"At what hour will you go, Mr. Melville?\"    \"I will take the second train, at nine o'clock. It will afford me time  enough, and save my getting up before my usual time.\"    Herbert would have preferred going by the first train, starting at  half-past seven, as it would have given him a longer day in the city,  but of course he felt that his employer had decided wisely.    \"It will be quite a treat to me, going to Boston,\" he said. \"I have only  been there three times in my life.\"    \"You certainly have not been much of a traveler, Herbert,\" said George  Melville, smiling. \"However, you are young, and you may see a good deal  of the world yet before you die.\"    \"I hope I will. It must be delightful to travel.\"    \"Yes, when you are young and strong,\" said Melville, thoughtfully. \"That  makes a great deal of difference in the enjoyment.\"    Herbert did not fail to put in an appearance at the hotel considerably  before it was time to leave for the train. George Melville smiled at his  punctuality.    \"I wish, Herbert,\" he said, \"that I could look forward with as much  pleasure as you feel to our trip to-day.\"    \"I wish so, too, Mr. Melville.\"    \"At any rate, I shall enjoy it better for having a companion.\"    The tickets were bought, and they took their places in one of the  passenger cars.    Just as the train was ready to start, Herbert saw a young man with a  ticket in his hand hurrying along the platform.    \"Why, there's Eben Graham!\" he said, in surprise.    \"Is he entering the cars?\"    \"Yes, he has just got into the car behind us.\"    \"I wonder if he is going to leave Wayneboro for good?\"    \"Probably he is only going to Boston for the day, perhaps to buy goods.\"    Herbert thought it doubtful whether Ebenezer Graham would trust his son  so far, but did not say so. Eben, on his part, had not seen Herbert on  board the train, and was not aware that he was a fellow passenger.    The journey was a tolerably long one--forty miles--and consumed an hour  and a half. At last they rolled into the depot, and before the train  had fairly stopped the passengers began to crowd toward the doors of the  car.    \"Let us remain till the crowd has passed out,\" said George Melville. \"It  is disagreeable to me to get into the throng, and it saves very little  time.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    Looking out of the car window, Herbert saw Eben Graham walking swiftly  along the platform, and could not forbear wondering what had brought him  to the city.    \"My doctor's office is on Tremont Street,\" said Mr. Melville. \"I  shall go there immediately, and may have to wait some time. It will be  tiresome to you, and I shall let you go where you please. You can meet  me at the Parker House, in School Street, at two o'clock.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    \"Do you know where the hotel is?\"    \"No, but I can find it,\" answered Herbert, confidently.    \"I believe I will also get you to attend to a part of my business for  me.\"    \"I shall be very glad to do so,\" said Herbert, sincerely. It made him  feel more important to be transacting business in Boston.    \"Here is a check for a hundred and fifty dollars on the Merchants'  Bank,\" continued George Melville. \"It is payable to the bearer, and you  will have no trouble in getting the money on it. You may present it at  the bank, and ask for fives and tens and a few small bills.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    Herbert felt rather proud to have so much confidence reposed in him, for  to him a hundred and fifty dollars seemed a large sum of money, and he  felt that George Melville was a rich man to draw so much at one time.    \"Had I better go to the bank at once?\" he asked.    \"Yes, I think so; of course, I need not caution you to take good care of  the money.\"    \"I'll be sure to do that, sir.\"    They walked together to Tremont Street, and Mr. Melville paused at a  doorway opposite the Common.    \"My doctor's office is upstairs,\" he said. \"We will part here and meet  at the hotel. If you are late, I may go into the dining room; so if you  don't see me in the reading room, go to the door of the dining room and  look in.\"    \"Very well, sir; but I think I shall be on time.\"    \"The bank is open now, and you can cash the check if you go down there.\"    Left to himself, Herbert walked slowly along, looking into shop windows  and observing with interested attention the people whom he met.    \"It must be very pleasant to live in the city,\" he thought; \"there is so  much going on all the time.\"    It is no wonder that country boys are drawn toward the city, and feel  that their cup of happiness would be full if they could get a position  in some city store. They do not always find the reality equal to their  anticipations. The long hours and strict discipline of a city office or  mercantile establishment are not much like the freedom they pictured  to themselves, and after they have paid their board bill in some shabby  boarding house they seldom find much left over, either for amusement  or needful expenses. The majority of boys would do better to remain in  their country homes, where at least they can live comfortably and at  small expense, and take such employment as may fall in their way. They  will stand a much better chance of reaching a competence in middle life  than if they helped to crowd the ranks of city clerks and salesmen.  There is many a hard-wor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"river; and the number of old and sick  speaks well for the humanity of the tribe.    Devoted to trade and become a people of brokers, of go-betweens,  of middle-men, the Mpongwe have now acquired an ease and  propriety, a polish and urbanity of manner which contrasts  strongly with the Kru-men and other tribes, who, despite  generations of intercourse with Europeans, are rough and  barbarous as their forefathers. The youths used to learn English,  which they spoke fluently and with tolerable accent, but always  barbarously; they are more successful with the easier neo-Latin  tongues. Their one aim in life is not happiness, but \"trust,\" an  African practice unwisely encouraged by Europeans; so Old Calabar  but a few years ago was not a trust-river,\" and consequently the  consul and the gunboat had little to do there. Many of them have  received advances of dollars by thousands, but the European  merchant has generally suffered from his credulity or rapacity.  In low cunning the native is more than a match for the stranger;  moreover, he has \"the pull\" in the all-important matter of time;  he can spend a fortnight haggling over the price of a tooth when  the unhappy capitalist is eating his heart. Like all the African  aristocracy, they hold agriculture beneath the dignity of man and  fit only for their women and slaves; the \"ladies\" also refuse to  work at the plantations, especially when young and pretty,  leaving them to the bush-folk, male and female. M. du Chaillu  repeatedly asserts (chap xix.) \"there is no property in land,\"  but this is a mistake often made in Africa. Labourers are hired  at the rate of two to three dollars per mensem, and gangs would  easily be collected if one of the chiefs were placed in command.  No sum of money will buy a free-born Mpongwe, and the sale is  forbidden by the laws of the land. A half-caste would fetch one  hundred dollars; a wild \"nigger\" near the river costs from thirty  to thirty-five dollars; the same may be bought in the Apinji  country for four dollars' worth of assorted goods, the \"bundle-  trade\" as it is called; but there is the imminent risk of the  chattel's running away. A man's only attendants being now his  wives and serviles, it is evident that plurality and domestic  servitude will extend--      \"Far into summers which we shall not see;\"    in fact, till some violent revolution of society shall have  introduced a servant class.    The three grades of Mpongwe may be considered as rude beginnings  of caste. The first are the \"Sons of the Soil,\" the \"OngwÃ¡ ntye\"  (contracted from Onwana wi ntye), Mpongwes of pure blood; the  second are the \"MbÃ¡mbÃ¡,\" children of free-men by serviles; and  lastly, \"NshÃ¡kÃ¡,\" in BÃ¡kele \"NshÃ¡kÃ¡,\" represents the slaves. M.  du Chaillu's distribution (chap, iii.) into five orders, namely,  pure, mixed with other tribes, half free, children of serviles,  and chattels, is somewhat over-artificial; at any rate, now it is  not generally recognized. Like the high-caste Hindu, the nobler  race will marry women of lower classes; for instance, King  Njogoni's mother was a Benga; but the inverse proceeding is a  disgrace to the woman, apparently an instinctive feeling on the  part of the reproducer, still lingering in the most advanced  societies. Old travellers record a belief that, unlike all other  Guinea races, the Mpongwe marries his mother, sister, or  daughter; and they compare the practice with that of the polished  Persians and the Peruvian Incas, who thus kept pure the solar and  lunar blood. If this \"breeding-in\" ever existed, no trace of it  now remains; on the contrary, every care is taken to avoid  marriages of consanguinity. Bowdich, indeed, assures us that a  man may not look at nor converse with his mother-in-law, on pain  of a heavy, perhaps a ruinous fine; \"this singular law is founded  on the tradition of an incest.\"    Marriage amongst the Mpongwe is a purely civil contract, as in  Africa generally, and so perhaps it will some day be in Europe,  Asia, and America. CÂœlebs pays a certain sum for the bride, who,  where \"marriage by capture\" is unknown, has no voice in the  matter. Many promises of future \"dash\" are made to the girl's  parents; and drinking, drumming, and dancing form the ceremony.  The following is, or rather I should say was, a fair list of  articles paid for a virgin bride. One fine silk hat, one cap, one  coat; five to twenty pieces of various cottons, plain and  ornamental; two to twenty silk kerchiefs; three to thirty jars of  rum; twenty pounds of trade tobacco; two hatchets; two cutlasses;  plates and dishes, mugs and glasses, five each; six knives; one  kettle; one brass pan; two to three Neptunes (caldrons, the old  term being \"Neptune's pots\"), a dozen bars of iron; copper and  brass rings, chains with small links, and minor articles ad  libitum. The \"settlement\" is the same in kind, but has increased  during the last forty years, and specie has become much more  common.[FN#10]    After marriage there is a mutual accommodation system suggesting  the cicisbeo or mariage Ã  trois school; hence we read that wives,  like the much-maligned Xantippe, were borrowed and lent, and that  not fulfilling the promise of a loan is punishable by heavy  damages. Where the husband acts adjutor or cavaliere to his  friend's \"Omantwe\"--female person or wife--and the friend is  equally complaisant, wedlock may hardly be called permanent, and  there can be no tie save children. The old immorality endures; it  is as if the command were reversed by accepting that misprint  which so scandalized the Star Chamber, \"Thou shalt commit  adultery.\" Yet, unpermitted, the offence is one against property,  and Moechus may be cast in damages ranging from $100 to $200:  what is known in low civilization as the \"panel dodge\" is an  infamy familiar to almost all the maritime tribes of Africa. He  must indeed be a Solomon of a son who, sur les bords du Gabon,  can guess at his own sire; a question so impertinent is never put  by the ex-officio father. The son succeeds by inheritance to his  father's relict, who, being generally in years, is condemned to  be useful when she has ceased to be an ornament, and, if there  are several, they are equally divided amongst the heirs.    Trading tribes rarely affect the pundonor which characterizes the  pastoral and the predatory; these people traffic in all things,  even in the chastity of their women. What with pre-nuptial  excesses, with early unions, often infructuous, with a virtual  system of community, and with universal drunkenness, it is not to  be wondered at if the maritime tribes of Africa degenerate and  die out. Such apparently is the modus operandi by which Nature  rids herself of the effete races which have served to clear the  ground and to pave the way for higher successors. Wealth and  luxury, so generally inveighed against by poets and divines,  injure humanity only when they injuriously affect reproduction;  and poverty is praised only because it breeds more men. The true  tests of the physical prosperity of a race, and of its position  in the world, are bodily strength and the excess of births over  deaths.    Separation after marriage can hardly be dignified on the Gaboon  by the name of divorce. Whenever a woman has or fancies she has a  grievance, she leaves her husband, returns to \"the paternal\" and  marries again. Quarrels about the sex are very common, yet, in  cases of adultery the old murderous assaults are now rare except  amongst the backwoodsmen. The habit was simply to shoot some man  belonging to the seducer's or to the ravisher's village; the  latter shot somebody in the nearest settlement, and so on till  the affair was decided. In these days \"violent retaliation for  personal jealousy always 'be-littles' a man in the eyes of an  African community.\" Perhaps also he unconsciously recognizes the  sentiment ascribed to Mohammed, \"Laysa bi-zÃ¡nyatin ilia bi zÃ¡ni,\"  \"there is no adulteress without an adulterer,\" meaning that the  husband has set the example.    Polygamy is, of course, the order of the day; it is a necessity  to the men, and even the women disdain to marry a \"one-wifer.\" As  amongst all pluralists, from Moslem to Mormon, the senior or  first married is No. 1; here called \"best wife:\" she is the  goodman's viceroy, and she rules the home-kingdom with absolute  sway. Yet the Mpongwe do not, like other tribes on the west  coast, practise that separation of the sexes during gestation and  lactation, which is enjoined to the Hebrews, recommended by  Catholicism, and commanded by Mormonism--a system which partly  justifies polygamy. In Portuguese Guinea the enceinte is claimed  by her relatives, especially by the women, for three years, that  she may give undivided attention to her offspring, who is rightly  believed to be benefited by the separation, and that she may  return to her husband with renewed vigour. Meanwhile custom  allows the man to co-habit with a slave girl.    Polygamy, also, in Africa is rather a political than a domestic  or social institution. A \"judicious culture of the marriage tie\"  is necessary amongst savages and barbarians whose only friends  and supporters are blood relations and nuptial connections;  besides which, a multitude of wives ministers to the great man's  pride and influence, as well as to his pleasures and to his  efficiency. When the head wife ages, she takes charge of the  girlish brides committed to her guardianship by the husband. I  should try vainly to persuade the English woman that there can be  peace in households so constituted: still, such is the case.  Messrs. Wilson and Du Chaillu both assert that the wives rarely  disagree amongst themselves. The sentimental part of love is  modified; the common husband becomes the patriarch, not the  paterfamilias; the wife is not the mistress, but the mÃ¨re de  famille. The alliance rises or sinks to one of interest and  affection instead of being amorous or"]]]
