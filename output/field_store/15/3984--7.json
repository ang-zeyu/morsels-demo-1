I was an Eastender from tongue to toe at the  moment, but you will understand that I don't run unnecessary risks of  recognition by a brute like that.\"    \"He's not alone, I hear.\"    \"By no means; there's at least one other man with him; and it's  suggested that there may be an accomplice here in the house.\"    \"Did Lord Crowley tell you so?\"    \"Crowley and the champagne between them.  In confidence, of course,  just as your girl told you; but even in confidence he never let on  about Mackenzie.  He told me there was a detective in the background,  but that was all.  Putting him up as a guest is evidently their big  secret, to be kept from the other guests because it might offend them,  but more particularly from the servants whom he's here to watch.  That's my reading of the situation, Bunny, and you will agree with me  that it's infinitely more interesting than we could have imagined it  would prove.\"    \"But infinitely more difficult for us,\" said I, with a sigh of  pusillanimous relief.  \"Our hands are tied for this week, at all  events.\"    \"Not necessarily, my dear Bunny, though I admit that the chances are  against us.  Yet I'm not so sure of that either.  There are all sorts  of possibilities in these three-cornered combinations.  Set A to watch  B, and he won't have an eye left for C.  That's the obvious theory, but  then Mackenzie's a very big A.  I should be sorry to have any boodle  about me with that man in the house.  Yet it would be great to nip in  between A and B and score off them both at once!  It would be worth a  risk, Bunny, to do that; it would be worth risking something merely to  take on old hands like B and his men at their own old game!  Eh, Bunny?  That would be something like a match. Gentlemen and Players at single  wicket, by Jove!\"    His eyes were brighter than I had known them for many a day.  They  shone with the perverted enthusiasm which was roused in him only by the  contemplation of some new audacity.  He kicked off his shoes and began  pacing his room with noiseless rapidity; not since the night of the Old  Bohemian dinner to Reuben Rosenthall had Raffles exhibited such  excitement in my presence; and I was not sorry at the moment to be  reminded of the fiasco to which that banquet had been the prelude.    \"My dear A. J.,\" said I in his very own tone, \"you're far too fond of  the uphill game; you will eventually fall a victim to the sporting  spirit and nothing else.  Take a lesson from our last escape, and fly  lower as you value our skins.  Study the house as much as you like, but  do--not--go and shove your head into Mackenzie's mouth!\"    My wealth of metaphor brought him to a stand-still, with his cigarette  between his fingers and a grin beneath his shining eyes.    \"You're quite right, Bunny.  I won't.  I really won't.  Yet--you saw  old Lady Melrose's necklace?  I've been wanting it for years!  But I'm  not going to play the fool; honor bright, I'm not; yet--by Jove!--to  get to windward of the professors and Mackenzie too!  It would be a  great game, Bunny, it would be a great game!\"    \"Well, you mustn't play it this week.\"    \"No, no, I won't.  But I wonder how the professors think of going to  work?  That's what one wants to know.  I wonder if they've really got  an accomplice in the house?  How I wish I knew their game!  But it's  all right, Bunny; don't you be jealous; it shall be as you wish.\"    And with that assurance I went off to my own room, and so to bed with  an incredibly light heart. I had still enough of the honest man in me  to welcome the postponement of our actual felonies, to dread their  performance, to deplore their necessity: which is merely another way of  stating the too patent fact that I was an incomparably weaker man than  Raffles, while every whit as wicked. I had, however, one rather strong  point.  I possessed the gift of dismissing unpleasant considerations,  not intimately connected with the passing moment, entirely from my mind.  Through the exercise of this faculty I had lately been living my  frivolous life in town with as much ignoble enjoyment as I had derived  from it the year before; and similarly, here at Milchester, in the  long-dreaded cricket-week, I had after all a quite excellent time.    It is true that there were other factors in this pleasing  disappointment.  In the first place, mirabile dictu, there were one or  two even greater duffers than I on the Abbey cricket-field.  Indeed,  quite early in the week, when it was of most value to me, I gained  considerable kudos for a lucky catch; a ball, of which I had merely  heard the hum, stuck fast in my hand, which Lord Amersteth himself  grasped in public congratulation.  This happy accident was not to be  undone even by me, and, as nothing succeeds like success, and the  constant encouragement of the one great cricketer on the field was in  itself an immense stimulus, I actually made a run or two in my very  next innings.  Miss Melhuish said pretty things to me that night at the  great ball in honor of Viscount Crowley's majority; she also told me  that was the night on which the robbers would assuredly make their  raid, and was full of arch tremors when we sat out in the garden,  though the entire premises were illuminated all night long.  Meanwhile  the quiet Scotchman took countless photographs by day, which he  developed by night in a dark room admirably situated in the servants'  part of the house; and it is my firm belief that only two of his  fellow-guests knew Mr. Clephane of Dundee for Inspector Mackenzie of  Scotland Yard.    The week was to end with a trumpery match on the Saturday, which two or  three of us intended abandoning early in order to return to town that  night.  The match, however, was never played.  In the small hours of  the Saturday morning a tragedy took place at Milchester Abbey.    Let me tell of the thing as I saw and heard it.  My room opened upon  the central gallery, and was not even on the same floor as that on  which Raffles--and I think all the other men--were quartered.  I had  been put, in fact, into the dressing-room of one of the grand suites,  and my too near neighbors were old Lady Melrose and my host and  hostess.  Now, by the Friday evening the actual festivities were at an  end, and, for the first time that week, I must have been sound asleep  since midnight, when all at once I found myself sitting up breathless.  A heavy thud had come against my door, and now I heard hard breathing  and the dull stamp of muffled feet.    \"I've got ye,\" muttered a voice.  \"It's no use struggling.\"    It was the Scotch detective, and a new fear turned me cold.  There was  no reply, but the hard breathing grew harder still, and the muffled  feet beat the floor to a quicker measure.  In sudden panic I sprang out  of bed and flung open my door. A light burnt low on the landing, and by  it I could see Mackenzie swaying and staggering in a silent tussle with  some powerful adversary.    \"Hold this man!\" he cried, as I appeared. \"Hold the rascal!\"    But I stood like a fool until the pair of them backed into me, when,  with a deep breath I flung myself on the fellow, whose face I had seen  at last. He was one of the footmen who waited at table; and no sooner  had I pinned him than the detective loosed his hold.    \"Hang on to him,\" he cried.  \"There's more of 'em below.\"    And he went leaping down the stairs, as other doors opened and Lord  Amersteth and his son appeared simultaneously in their pyjamas.  At  that my man ceased struggling; but I was still holding him when Crowley  turned up the gas.    \"What the devil's all this?\" asked Lord Amersteth, blinking.  \"Who was  that ran downstairs?\"    \"Mac--Clephane!\" said I hastily.    \"Aha!\" said he, turning to the footman.  \"So you're the scoundrel, are  you?  Well done!  Well done!  Where was he caught?\"    I had no idea.    \"Here's Lady Melrose's door open,\" said Crowley.  \"Lady Melrose!  Lady  Melrose!\"    \"You forget she's deaf,\" said Lord Amersteth. \"Ah! that'll be her maid.\"    An inner door had opened; next instant there was a little shriek, and a  white figure gesticulated on the threshold.    \"OÃ¹ donc est l'ecrin de Madame la Marquise?  La fenetre est ouverte.  Il a disparu!\"    \"Window open and jewel-case gone, by Jove!\" exclaimed Lord Amersteth.  \"Mais comment est Madame la Marquise?  Est elle bien?\"    \"Oui, milor.  Elle dort.\"    \"Sleeps through it all,\" said my lord.  \"She's the only one, then!\"    \"What made Mackenzie--Clephane--bolt?\" young Crowley asked me.    \"Said there were more of them below.\"    \"Why the devil couldn't you tell us so before?\" he cried, and went  leaping downstairs in his turn.    He was followed by nearly all the cricketers, who now burst upon the  scene in a body, only to desert it for the chase.  Raffles was one of  them, and I would gladly have been another, had not the footman chosen  this moment to hurl me from him, and to make a dash in the direction  from which they had come.  Lord Amersteth had him in an instant; but  the fellow fought desperately, and it took the two of us to drag him  downstairs, amid a terrified chorus from half-open doors.  Eventually  we handed him over to two other footmen who appeared with their  nightshirts tucked into their trousers, and my host was good enough to  compliment me as he led the way outside.    \"I thought I heard a shot,\" he added.  \"Didn't you?\"    \"I thought I heard three.\"    And out we dashed into the darkness.    I remember how the gravel pricked my feet, how the wet grass numbed  them as we made for the sound of voices on an outlying lawn.  So dark  was the night that we were in the cricketers' midst before we saw the  shimmer of their pyjamas; and then Lord Amersteth almost trod on  Mackenzie as he lay prostrate in the dew.    \"Who's this?\" he cried.  \"What on earth's happened?\"    \"It's Clephane,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7060"],[0,"At Agincourt (#11)"],[1,"my shafts in ten minutes than a cannon would do  with a week's firing. I wonder they trouble to carry them about with them,  save that folks are not accustomed to their noise yet, and might open  their gates when they see them, while they would make a stout defence if  they had only ballistas and mangonels to deal with. I suppose when they  have got the shelters close to the moat they will bring up planks to throw  across.\"    \"Yes, no doubt they will try that, Tom; but the moat is over wide for  planks, and I think it more likely that they will have provided themselves  with sacks, and filled them with earth, so as to make a passage across  with them.\"    \"As to the planks not being long enough, Master Guy, they could get over  that easy enough. They would only have to send three or four swimmers  across the moat, then thrust long beams over for those who had crossed to  fix firmly, and then lay short planks across them.\"    \"So they would, Tom; I did not think of that. Well, at any rate, I expect  they will manage to get across the moat somehow and plant ladders against  the wall.\"    \"And we shall chuck them down again,\" Tom said.    \"They won't care much for that. But as long as they cannot knock a breach  in the walls I warrant that we can hold them.\"          CHAPTER IV -- A FATAL ACCIDENT      As soon as the sun had set, the defenders gathered on the walls. Fires had  already been lighted there and cauldrons of water and pitch suspended over  them, and sacks of quicklime placed in readiness to be emptied; great  piles of stone were placed at short intervals.    \"As long as they attack at only one or two places,\" Sir Eustace said to  his wife, \"I am quite confident that we shall repulse them. If they attack  at a dozen they may succeed, as we should only have a couple of archers  and six or seven men-at-arms at each point, besides a score or so of the  vassals. I have no doubt that these will fight stoutly, for the sight of  their burning homes has roused them, and each man is longing to get a blow  at those who have wrought them so much damage. Still, thirty men are but a  small party to beat back an assault by hundreds. However, if they carry  the outside wall they will have the second to deal with, and there we  shall stand much thicker together, and they cannot attack from many  points, while if we are driven into the keep, we shall be stronger still.  Have you seen that the women and children are ready to retire into the  keep as soon as the assault begins?\"    \"I have been round myself and given orders,\" Dame Margaret said. \"I have  told them that the inner gate will be closed as soon as fighting begins,  and that those who do not come in before that must remain outside, or else  mount to the walls and cross the bridges, for that on no account will the  gates be opened again.\"    \"That is well, Margaret. I am now about to station two men-at-arms on the  inner wall at the end of each of the three bridges, so that they may be  ready on the instant to turn the catches and let the bridges fall behind  our men as they rush across. The tenants have already driven as many more  of their best horses and cattle into the inner court as can find standing  room, so that their loss may be as small as possible. If the outer wall is  carried, I have no great fear that the second wall will be taken; the  plunderers who form the mass of Sir Clugnet's force will have had enough  and more than enough of fighting by the time that they capture the outer  one. Whatever happens, do not show yourself on the walls to-night, and see  that the children do not leave their beds; you can do naught, and will see  but little in the dark. To-morrow morning, wife, I will leave you free to  go among the soldiers and give them encouragement as may be needed, but  for to-night, I pray you stir not out. I will send Henry from time to time  to let you know how matters go.\"    Rapidly the men gathered on the walls; each had had his post assigned to  him, and when Sir Eustace made a tour of inspection he was glad to see how  confidently each man bore himself, and how well prepared to give the enemy  a warm reception. As soon as it became dark, the outwork on the other side  of the moat was abandoned, the defenders called into the castle, and the  drawbridge raised, for it was evident to Sir Eustace that although it  might be maintained in daylight, by the aid of the archers on the wall, it  could not resist an attack by overwhelming numbers when deprived of that  assistance. Sir Eustace, after inspecting the men's arms, ordered all  those on the walls, with the exception of a few who were to remain on  watch, to sit down with their backs against the battlement, and to  maintain an absolute silence.    \"It is by sound rather than sight that we shall be able to judge of their  movements,\" he said. \"All sitting down may sleep, if it so pleases them,  till they are roused.\"    The sentries were ten in number, and were all taken from among the  archers. Most of these men had been accustomed to the chase, were skilled  in woodcraft, and accustomed to listen to the slightest noises that might  tell of the movement of a stag and enable them to judge his position. Sir  Eustace, for the present, posted himself in his old position over the  gate. Jean Bouvard and Guy were with him, while Long Tom moved round and  round the walls to gather news from his sentries. Sometimes Guy  accompanied him.    \"They are moving,\" Tom the archer said as he stood listening intently on  the wall at the rear of the castle. \"It is an hour past sundown, and about  the time the knaves will be mustering if they intend to make a regular  attack on us. If it had been only an escalade there would have been no  sound until nearly morning. I thought I heard them on the other side, but  I am sure of it now.\"    \"I can hear singing up at their camp,\" Guy said, \"but I don't hear  anything else.\"    \"They are keeping that up to deceive us, I expect. But besides the singing  there is a sort of rustle. I don't think that they are coming this way at  present, or we should hear it plainer. It seems to me that it is spreading  all round.\"    \"I will go back and tell Sir Eustace what you think, Tom.\"    Guy hurried back to the other side of the castle.    \"Long Tom thinks, Sir Eustace, that he can hear a stir all round.\"    \"We have noticed it too--at least, all round this side. Tell him not to  call the men to their feet until the enemy approaches more closely. I  believe that it is the march of a large number of men, and that they are  probably moving to the positions assigned to them, but it may be another  hour or two before they close in.\"    In a short time the sound became more distinct; from a rustle it rose to a  deep confused murmur, then an occasional clink as of arms striking armour  became audible. Most of the men on the walls were now on their feet gazing  into the darkness. Presently the sound ceased, first on one side and then  on another.    \"I fancy they are all at their stations now, Jean Bouvard; we shall soon  hear more of them. Do not let your archers shoot, Tom, until they can make  them out very distinctly. We may be sure that they will come up with their  mantlets, and it would be a waste of arrows to loose at them until they  are close to the moat; but of course if separate figures can be  distinguished your men will draw on them.\"    In a quarter of an hour messengers came from various points on the wall  saying that there was something moving within sight, and to those at the  post over the gate a dark confused mass like a shadow seemed to be slowly  coming down towards their outwork.    \"Touch off the guns, Jean,\" Sir Eustace said; \"we shall get no further  chance of catching them in a body.\"    The captain stooped, lit two touchfires at the lantern standing in  readiness, gave one to a man-at-arms, and went with the other to a cannon.  Both the guns had been filled to the muzzle with bits of iron and nails,  and had been laid to bear on the slope beyond the outwork. They were fired  almost simultaneously, and the sound was followed by yells of pain and  dismay. The besiegers, seeing that there was nothing further to gain by  concealment, burst into a shout that ran all round the castle, and were  answered by one of defiance from the walls. The sound was succeeded by  loud orders from the leaders of the various assaulting parties, and the  objects before but dimly seen, now approached the walls rapidly. Jean  Bouvard hurried away to superintend the defence at other parts.    \"You may as well go the other way, Guy, and let me know from time to time  how things are getting on. Henry, run down to your mother and tell her  that the enemy are moving up to the moat, and that it will be some time  before there is any hard fighting; then come back here again.\"    It was easier to see from the side walls than it had been in front, for in  front there was a glow in the sky from the number of fires burning beyond  the crest of the slope, and Guy was able to make out what seemed to him a  wall extending some fifteen yards, near the edge of the moat. The archers  and crossbow-men gathered opposite to it had just begun to shoot. Behind  this wall there were other dark masses irregularly placed, and extending  back as far as he could see. An occasional cry told that the arrows were  doing execution upon the unseen assailants behind the mantlets, and soon  the blows of cross-bow bolts against the wall and the sharp tap of arrows  told that the enemy had also betaken themselves to their arms. A number of  giant torches had been prepared, consisting of sheafs of straw soaked with  pitch, and one of these was now lighted and elevated on a pole some  fifteen feet above the battlement. Its light was sufficient to enable the  scene beyond to be clearly made out. A row of mantlets some eight feet  high had been placed by the moat, and others of the same height, and seven"]]]
