Cracky, den I'm glad dat youse wasn't goin' like  dat,\" and the tramp seemed somewhat confused. This time Tom looked  at him more closely, for the change in his language had been very  plain. The fellow seemed uneasy, and turned his face away. As he did  so Tom caught a glimpse of what he was sure was a false beard. It  was altogether too well-kept a beard to be a natural one for such a  dirty tramp as this one appeared to be.    \"That fellow's disguised!\" Tom thought. \"He's playing a part. I  wonder if I'd better take chances and spring it on him that I'm on  to his game?\"    Then the ragged man spoke again:    \"I s'pose it was part my fault, cully. I didn't know dat any guy was  comin' along on one of dem buzz-machines, or I'd been more careful.  I don't s'pose youse meant to upset me?\" and he looked at Tom more  boldly. This time his words seemed so natural, and his beard, now  that Tom took a second look at it, so much a part of himself, that  the young inventor wondered if he could have been mistaken in his  first surmise.    \"Perhaps he was once a gentleman, and has turned tramp because of  hard luck,\" thought Tom. \"That would account for him using good  language at times. Guess I'd better keep still.\" Then to the tramp  he said: \"I'm sure I didn't mean to hit you. I admit I wasn't  looking where I was going, but I never expected to meet any one on  this road. I certainly didn't expect to see a--\"    He paused in some confusion. He was about to use the term \"tramp,\"  and he hesitated, not knowing how it would be received by his  victim.    \"Oh, dat's all right, cully. Call me a tramp--I know dat's what  youse was goin' t' say. I'm used t' it. I've been a hobo so many  years now dat I don't mind. De time was when I was a decent chap,  though. But I'm a tramp now. Say, youse couldn't lend me a quarter,  could youse?\"    He approached closer to Tom, and looked quickly up and down the  road. The highway was deserted, nor was there any likelihood that  any one would come along. Tom was somewhat apprehensive, for the  tramp was a burly specimen. The young inventor, however, was not so  much alarmed at the prospect of a personal encounter, as that he  feared he might be robbed, not only of his money, but the valuable  papers and model he carried. Even if the tramp was content with  taking his money, it would mean that Tom would have to go back home  for more, and so postpone his trip.    So it was with no little alarm that he watched the ragged man coming  nearer to him. Then a bright idea came into Tom's head. He quickly  shifted his position so that he brought the heavy motor-cycle  between the man and himself. He resolved, if the tramp showed a  disposition to attack him, to push the machine over on him, and this  would give Tom a chance to attack the thief to better advantage.  However, the \"hobo\" showed no evidence of wanting to resort to  highwayman methods. He paused a short distance from the machine, and  said admiringly:    \"Dat's a pretty shebang youse has.\"    \"Yes, it's very fair,\" admitted Tom, who was not yet breathing  easily.    \"Kin youse go far on it?\"    \"Two hundred miles a day, easily.\"    \"Fer cats' sake! An' I can't make dat ridin' on de blind baggage;  but dat's 'cause I gits put off so much. But say, is youse goin' to  let me have dat quarter? I need it, honest I do. I ain't had nuttin'  t' eat in two days.\"    The man's tone was whining. Surely he seemed like a genuine tramp,  and Tom felt a little sorry for him. Besides, he felt that he owed  him something for the unceremonious manner in which he had knocked  the fellow down. Tom reached his hand in his pocket for some change,  taking care to keep the machine between himself and the tramp.    \"Are youse goin' far on dat rig-a-ma-jig?\" went on the man as he  looked carefully over the motor-cycle.    \"To Albany,\" answered Tom, and the moment the words were out of his  mouth he wished he could recall them. All his suspicions regarding  the tramp came back to him. But the ragged chap appeared to attach  no significance to them.    \"Albany? Dat's in Jersey, ain't it?\" he asked.    \"No, it's in New York,\" replied Tom, and then, to change the  subject, he pulled out a half-dollar and handed it to the man. As he  did so Tom noticed that the tramp had tattooed on the little finger  of his left hand a blue ring.    \"Dat's de stuff! Youse is a reg'lar millionaire, youse is!\"  exclaimed the tramp, and his manner seemed in earnest. \"I'll  remember youse, I will. What's your name, anyhow, cully?\"    \"Tom Swift,\" replied our hero, and again he wished he had not told.  This time he was sure the tramp started and glanced at him quickly,  but perhaps it was only his imagination.    \"Tom Swift,\" repeated the man musingly, and his tones were different  from the whining ones in which he had asked for money. Then, as if  recollecting the part he was playing, he added: \"I s'pose dey calls  youse dat because youse rides so quick on dat machine. But I'm  certainly obliged to youse--Tom Swift, an' I hopes youse gits t'  Albany, in Jersey, in good time.\"    He turned away, and Tom was beginning to breathe more easily when  the ragged man, with a quick gesture, reached out and grabbed hold  of the motor-cycle. He gave it such a pull that it was nearly torn  from Tom's grasp. The lad was so startled at the sudden exhibition  of vindictiveness an the part of the tramp that he did not know what  to do. Then, before he could recover himself, the tramp darted into  the bushes.    \"I guess Happy Harry--dat's me--has spoiled your ride t' Albany!\"  the tramp cried. \"Maybe next time youse won't run down poor fellers  on de road,\" and with that, the ragged man, shaking his fist at Tom,  was lost to sight in the underbrush.    \"Well, if that isn't a queer end up,\" mused Tom. \"He must be crazy.  I hope I don't meet you again, Happy Harry, or whatever your name  is. Guess I'll get out of this neighborhood.\"          CHAPTER XII.    THE MEN IN THE AUTO      Tom first made sure that the package containing the model was still  safely in place back of his saddle on the motor-cycle. Finding it  there he next put his hand in his pocket to see that he had the  papers.    \"They're all right,\" spoke Tom aloud. \"I didn't know but what that  chap might have worked a pickpocket game on me. I'm glad I didn't  meet him after dark. Well, it's a good thing it's no worse. I wonder  if he tried to get my machine away from me? Don't believe he'd know  how to ride it if he did.\"    Tom wheeled his motor-cycle to a hard side-path along the old road,  and jumped into the saddle. He worked the pedals preparatory to  turning on the gasolene and spark to set the motor in motion. As he  threw forward the levers, having acquired what he thought was the  necessary momentum, he was surprised that no explosion followed. The  motor seemed \"dead.\"    \"That's queer,\" he thought, and he began to pedal more rapidly. \"It  always used to start easily. Maybe it doesn't like this sandy  road.\"    It was hard work sending the heavy machine along by \"leg power,\" and  once more, when he had acquired what he thought was sufficient  speed, Tom turned on the power. But no explosions followed, and in  some alarm he jumped to the ground.    \"Something's wrong,\" he said aloud. \"That tramp must have damaged  the machine when he yanked it so.\" Tom went quickly over the  different parts. It did not take him long to discover what the  trouble was. One of the wires, leading from the batteries to the  motor, which wire served to carry the current of electricity that  exploded the mixture of air and gasolene, was missing. It had been  broken off close to the battery box and the spark plug.    \"That's what Happy Harry did!\" exclaimed Tom. \"He pulled that wire  off when he yanked my machine. That's what he meant by hoping I'd  get to Albany. That fellow was no tramp. He was disguised, and up to  some game. And he knows something about motor-cycles, too, or he  never would have taken that wire. I'm stalled, now, for I haven't  got another piece. I ought to have brought some. I'll have to push  this machine until I get to town, or else go back home.\"    The young inventor looked up and down the lonely road, undecided  what to do. To return home meant that he would be delayed in getting  to Albany, for he would lose a day. If he pushed on to Pompville he  might be able to get a bit of wire there.    Tom decided that was his best plan, and plodded on through the thick  sand. He had not gone more than a quarter of a mile, every step  seeming harder than the preceding one, when he heard, from the woods  close at his left hand, a gun fired. He jumped so that he nearly let  the motor-cycle fall over, for a wild idea came into his head that  the tramp had shot at him. With a quickly-beating heart the lad  looked about him.    \"I wonder if that was Happy Harry?\" he mused.    There was a crackling in the bushes and Tom, wondering what he might  do to protect himself, looked toward the place whence the noise  proceeded. A moment later a hunter stepped into view. The man  carried a gun and wore a canvas suit, a belt about his waist being  filled with cartridges.    \"Hello!\" he exclaimed pleasantly, Then, seeing a look of alarm on  the lad's face, he went on:    \"I hope I didn't shoot in your direction, young man; did I?\"    \"No--no, sir,\" replied the youthful inventor, who had hardly  recovered his composure. \"I heard your gun, and I imagined--\"    \"Did you think you had been shot? You must have a very vivid  imagination, for I fired in the air.\"    \"No, I didn't exactly think that,\" replied Tom, \"but I just had an  encounter with an ugly tramp, and I feared he might be using me for  a target.\"    \"Is that so. I hadn't noticed any tramps around here, and I've been  in these woods nearly all day. Did he harm you?\"    \"No, not me, but my motor-cycle,\" and the lad explained."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#11)"],[1,"completed.    I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect  to vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was  justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from  blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and  peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to  disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge  is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself  has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for  those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that  study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human  mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit  whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic  affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Caesar would have spared his  country; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the  empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.    But I forget that I am moralising in the most interesting part of my  tale; and your looks remind me to proceed.    My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my  silence by enquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.  Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not  watch the blossom or the expanding leaves--sights which before always  yielded me supreme delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.  The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a  close; and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had  succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared  rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other  unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.  Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a  most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my  fellow-creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew  alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my  purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed  that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and  I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.          CHAPTER V.      It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment  of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected  the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being  into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the  morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was  nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I  saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a  convulsive motion agitated its limbs.    [Illustration: \"_By the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw  the dull, yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a  convulsive motion agitated its limbs, ... I rushed out of the  room._\"]    How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the  wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as  beautiful. Beautiful!--Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the  work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,  and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only  formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost  of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his  shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.    The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of  human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole  purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived  myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far  exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the  dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.  Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of  the room, and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber, unable to  compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I  had before endured; and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes,  endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain:  I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I  saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of  Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted  the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her  features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my  dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the  grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my  sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered,  and every limb became convulsed: when, by the dim and yellow light of  the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the  wretch--the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain  of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin  wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand  was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed  down stairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which  I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up  and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and  fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the  demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.    Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy  again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I  had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those  muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing  such as even Dante could not have conceived.    I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and  hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly  sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with  this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had  been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a  hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!    Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my  sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple  and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates  of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the  streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the  wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my  view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt  impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a  black and comfortless sky.    I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by  bodily exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed  the streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was  doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on  with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:--        \"Like one who, on a lonely road,        Doth walk in fear and dread,      And, having once turned round, walks on,        And turns no more his head;      Because he knows a frightful fiend        Doth close behind him tread.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner.\"]    Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the  various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew  not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that  was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew  nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just  where I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry  Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. \"My dear  Frankenstein,\" exclaimed he, \"how glad I am to see you! how fortunate  that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!\"    Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought  back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home  so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot  my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during  many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in  the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval  continued talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own  good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. \"You may easily  believe,\" said he, \"how great was the difficulty to persuade my father  that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of  book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last,  for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that  of the Dutch schoolmaster in the Vicar of Wakefield:--'I have ten  thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'  But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and  he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of  knowledge.\"    \"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left  my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\"    \"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you  so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their"]]]
