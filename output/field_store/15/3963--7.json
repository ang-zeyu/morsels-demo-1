Before making his final decision, Dr. Beecher, accompanied by his  daughter Catherine, visited Cincinnati to take a general survey of  their proposed battlefield, and their impressions of the city are given  in the following letter written by the latter to Harriet in Boston:--    \"Here we are at last at our journey's end, alive and well. We are  staying with Uncle Samuel (Foote), whose establishment I will try and  sketch for you. It is on a height in the upper part of the city, and  commands a fine view of the whole of the lower town. The city does not  impress me as being so very new. It is true everything looks neat and  clean, but it is compact, and many of the houses are of brick and very  handsomely built. The streets run at right angles to each other, and  are wide and well paved. We reached here in three days from Wheeling,  and soon felt ourselves at home. The next day father and I, with three  gentlemen, walked out to Walnut Hills. The country around the city  consists of a constant succession and variety of hills of all shapes  and sizes, forming an extensive amphitheatre. The site of the seminary  is very beautiful and picturesque, though I was disappointed to find  that both river and city are hidden by intervening hills. I never saw  a place so capable of being rendered a paradise by the improvements  of taste as the environs of this city. Walnut Hills are so elevated  and cool that people have to leave there to be sick, it is said. The  seminary is located on a farm of one hundred and twenty-five acres of  fine land, with groves of superb trees around it, about two miles from  the city. We have finally decided on the spot where our house shall  stand in case we decide to come, and you cannot (where running water  or the seashore is wanting) find another more delightful spot for a  residence. It is on an eminence, with a grove running up from the back  to the very doors, another grove across the street in front, and fine  openings through which distant hills and the richest landscapes appear.    \"I have become somewhat acquainted with those ladies we shall have  the most to do with, and find them intelligent, New England sort of  folks. Indeed, this is a New England city in all its habits, and its  inhabitants are more than half from New England. The Second Church,  which is the best in the city, will give father a unanimous call to be  their minister, with the understanding that he will give them what time  he can spare from the seminary.    \"I know of no place in the world where there is so fair a prospect of  finding everything that makes social and domestic life pleasant. Uncle  John and Uncle Samuel are just the intelligent, sociable, free, and  hospitable sort of folk that everybody likes and everybody feels at  home with.    \"The folks are very anxious to have a school on our plan set on foot  here. We can have fine rooms in the city college building, which is  now unoccupied, and everybody is ready to lend a helping hand. As to  father, I never saw such a field of usefulness and influence as is  offered to him here.\"    This, then, was the field of labor in which the next eighteen years  of the life of Mrs. Stowe were to be passed. At this time her sister  Mary was married and living in Hartford, her brothers Henry Ward and  Charles were in college, while William and Edward, already licensed to  preach, were preparing to follow their father to the West.    [Illustration: THE HOME AT WALNUT HILLS, CINCINNATI.]    Mr. Beecher's preliminary journey to Cincinnati was undertaken in  the early spring of 1832, but he was not ready to remove his family  until October of that year. An interesting account of this westward  journey is given by Mrs. Stowe in a letter sent back to Hartford from  Cincinnati, as follows:--    \"Well, my dear, the great sheet is out and the letter is begun. All our  family are here (in New York), and in good health.    \"Father is to perform to-night in the Chatham Theatre! 'positively  for the _last_ time this season!' I don't know, I'm sure, as we shall  ever get to Pittsburgh. Father is staying here begging money for the  Biblical Literature professorship; the incumbent is to be C. Stowe.  Last night we had a call from Arthur Tappan and Mr. Eastman. Father  begged $2,000 yesterday, and now the good people are praying him to  abide certain days, as he succeeds so well. They are talking of sending  us off and keeping him here. I really dare not go and see Aunt Esther  and mother now; they were in the depths of tribulation before at  staying so long, and now,        'In the lowest depths, _another_ deep!'    Father is in high spirits. He is all in his own element,--dipping into  books; consulting authorities for his oration; going round here, there,  everywhere; begging, borrowing, and spoiling the Egyptians; delighted  with past success and confident for the future.    \"Wednesday. Still in New York. I believe it would kill me dead to live  long in the way I have been doing since I have been here. It is a sort  of agreeable delirium. There's only one thing about it, it is too  _scattering_. I begin to be athirst for the waters of quietness.\"    Writing from Philadelphia, she adds:--    \"Well, we did get away from New York at last, but it was through much  tribulation. The truckman carried all the family baggage to the wrong  wharf, and, after waiting and waiting on board the boat, we were  obliged to start without it, George remaining to look it up. Arrived  here late Saturday evening,--dull, drizzling weather; poor Aunt Esther  in dismay,--not a clean cap to put on,--mother in like state; all of  us destitute. We went, half to Dr. Skinner's and half to Mrs. Elmes's:  mother, Aunt Esther, father, and James to the former; Kate, Bella, and  myself to Mr. Elmes's. They are rich, hospitable folks, and act the  part of Gaius in apostolic times.... Our trunks came this morning.  Father stood and saw them all brought into Dr. Skinner's entry, and  then he swung his hat and gave a 'hurrah,' as any man would whose  wife had not had a clean cap or ruffle for a week. Father does not  succeed very well in opening purses here. Mr. Eastman says, however,  that this is not of much consequence. I saw to-day a notice in the  'Philadelphian' about father, setting forth how 'this distinguished  brother, with his large family, having torn themselves from the  endearing scenes of their home,' etc., etc., 'were going, like Jacob,'  etc.,--a very scriptural and appropriate flourish. It is too much after  the manner of men, or, as Paul says, speaking 'as a fool.' A number of  the pious people of this city are coming here this evening to hold a  prayer-meeting with reference to the journey and its object. For _this_  I thank them.\"    From Downington she writes:--    \"Here we all are,--Noah and his wife and his sons and his daughters,  with the cattle and creeping things, all dropped down in the front  parlor of this tavern, about thirty miles from Philadelphia. If to-day  is a fair specimen of our journey, it will be a very pleasant, obliging  driver, good roads, good spirits, good dinner, fine scenery, and now  and then some 'psalms and hymns and spiritual songs;' for with George  on board you may be sure of music of some kind. Moreover, George has  provided himself with a quantity of tracts, and he and the children  have kept up a regular discharge at all the wayfaring people we  encountered. I tell him he is _peppering_ the land with moral influence.    \"We are all well; all in good spirits. Just let me give you a peep  into our traveling household. Behold us, then, in the front parlor of  this country inn, all as much at home as if we were in Boston. Father  is sitting opposite to me at this table, reading; Kate is writing a  billet-doux to Mary on a sheet like this; Thomas is opposite, writing  in a little journal that he keeps; Sister Bell, too, has her little  record; George is waiting for a seat that he may produce his paper  and write. As for me, among the multitude of my present friends, my  heart still makes occasional visits to absent ones,--visits full of  pleasure, and full of cause of gratitude to Him who gives us friends.  I have thought of you often to-day, my G. We stopped this noon at a  substantial Pennsylvania tavern, and among the flowers in the garden  was a late monthly honeysuckle like the one at North Guilford. I made  a spring for it, but George secured the finest bunch, which he wore in  his button-hole the rest of the noon.    \"This afternoon, as we were traveling, we struck up and sang 'Jubilee.'  It put me in mind of the time when we used to ride along the rough  North Guilford roads and make the air vocal as we went along. Pleasant  times those. Those were blue skies, and that was a beautiful lake and  noble pine-trees and rocks they were that hung over it. But those we  shall look upon 'na mair.'    \"Well, my dear, there is a land where we shall not _love_ and _leave_.  Those skies shall never cease to shine, the waters of life we shall  _never_ be called upon _to leave_. We have here no continuing city, but  we seek one to come. In such thoughts as these I desire ever to rest,  and with such words as these let us 'comfort one another and edify one  another.'\"    \"Harrisburg, Sunday evening. Mother, Aunt Esther, George, and the  little folks have just gathered into Kate's room, and we have just been  singing. Father has gone to preach for Mr. De Witt. To-morrow we expect  to travel sixty-two miles, and in two more days shall reach Wheeling;  there we shall take the steamboat to Cincinnati.\"    On the same journey George Beecher writes:--    \"We had poor horses in crossing the mountains. Our average rate for  the last four days to Wheeling was forty-four miles. The journey,  which takes the mail-stage forty-eight hours, took us eight days.  At Wheeling we deliberated long whether to go on board a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6753"],[0,"Psmith in the City (#11)"],[1,"r, an excellent  man for the purpose in every respect, except that he possessed a very  strong accent.    The audience welcomed that accent uproariously. The electors of  Kenningford who really had any definite opinions on politics were  fairly equally divided. There were about as many earnest Liberals as  there were earnest Unionists. But besides these there was a strong  contingent who did not care which side won. These looked on elections  as Heaven-sent opportunities for making a great deal of noise. They  attended meetings in order to extract amusement from them; and they  voted, if they voted at all, quite irresponsibly. A funny story at the  expense of one candidate told on the morning of the polling, was quite  likely to send these brave fellows off in dozens filling in their  papers for the victim's opponent.    There was a solid block of these gay spirits at the back of the hall.  They received the Scotch peer with huge delight. He reminded them of  Harry Lauder and they said so. They addressed him affectionately as  'Arry', throughout his speech, which was rather long. They implored him  to be a pal and sing 'The Saftest of the Family'. Or, failing that, 'I  love a lassie'. Finding they could not induce him to do this, they did  it themselves. They sang it several times. When the peer, having  finished his remarks on the subject of Mr Bickersdyke, at length sat  down, they cheered for seven minutes, and demanded an encore.    The meeting was in excellent spirits when Mr Bickersdyke rose to  address it.    The effort of doing justice to the last speaker had left the free and  independent electors at the back of the hall slightly limp. The  bank-manager's opening remarks were received without any demonstration.    Mr Bickersdyke spoke well. He had a penetrating, if harsh, voice, and  he said what he had to say forcibly. Little by little the audience came  under his spell. When, at the end of a well-turned sentence, he paused  and took a sip of water, there was a round of applause, in which many  of the admirers of Mr Harry Lauder joined.    He resumed his speech. The audience listened intently. Mr Bickersdyke,  having said some nasty things about Free Trade and the Alien Immigrant,  turned to the Needs of the Navy and the necessity of increasing the  fleet at all costs.    'This is no time for half-measures,' he said. 'We must do our utmost.  We must burn our boats--'    'Excuse me,' said a gentle voice.    Mr Bickersdyke broke off. In the centre of the hall a tall figure had  risen. Mr Bickersdyke found himself looking at a gleaming eye-glass  which the speaker had just polished and inserted in his eye.    The ordinary heckler Mr Bickersdyke would have taken in his stride. He  had got his audience, and simply by continuing and ignoring the  interruption, he could have won through in safety. But the sudden  appearance of Psmith unnerved him. He remained silent.    'How,' asked Psmith, 'do you propose to strengthen the Navy by burning  boats?'    The inanity of the question enraged even the pleasure-seekers at the  back.    'Order! Order!' cried the earnest contingent.    'Sit down, fice!' roared the pleasure-seekers.    Psmith sat down with a patient smile.    Mr Bickersdyke resumed his speech. But the fire had gone out of it. He  had lost his audience. A moment before, he had grasped them and played  on their minds (or what passed for minds down Kenningford way) as on a  stringed instrument. Now he had lost his hold.    He spoke on rapidly, but he could not get into his stride. The trivial  interruption had broken the spell. His words lacked grip. The dead  silence in which the first part of his speech had been received, that  silence which is a greater tribute to the speaker than any applause,  had given place to a restless medley of little noises; here a cough;  there a scraping of a boot along the floor, as its wearer moved  uneasily in his seat; in another place a whispered conversation. The  audience was bored.    Mr Bickersdyke left the Navy, and went on to more general topics. But  he was not interesting. He quoted figures, saw a moment later that he  had not quoted them accurately, and instead of carrying on boldly, went  back and corrected himself.    'Gow up top!' said a voice at the back of the hall, and there was a  general laugh.    Mr Bickersdyke galloped unsteadily on. He condemned the Government. He  said they had betrayed their trust.    And then he told an anecdote.    'The Government, gentlemen,' he said, 'achieves nothing worth  achieving, and every individual member of the Government takes all the  credit for what is done to himself. Their methods remind me, gentlemen,  of an amusing experience I had while fishing one summer in the Lake  District.'    In a volume entitled 'Three Men in a Boat' there is a story of how the  author and a friend go into a riverside inn and see a very large trout  in a glass case. They make inquiries about it, have men assure them,  one by one, that the trout was caught by themselves. In the end the  trout turns out to be made of plaster of Paris.    Mr Bickersdyke told that story as an experience of his own while  fishing one summer in the Lake District.    It went well. The meeting was amused. Mr Bickersdyke went on to draw a  trenchant comparison between the lack of genuine merit in the trout and  the lack of genuine merit in the achievements of His Majesty's  Government.    There was applause.    When it had ceased, Psmith rose to his feet again.    'Excuse me,' he said.          11. Misunderstood      Mike had refused to accompany Psmith to the meeting that evening,  saying that he got too many chances in the ordinary way of business of  hearing Mr Bickersdyke speak, without going out of his way to make  more. So Psmith had gone off to Kenningford alone, and Mike, feeling  too lazy to sally out to any place of entertainment, had remained at  the flat with a novel.    He was deep in this, when there was the sound of a key in the latch,  and shortly afterwards Psmith entered the room. On Psmith's brow there  was a look of pensive care, and also a slight discoloration. When he  removed his overcoat, Mike saw that his collar was burst and hanging  loose and that he had no tie. On his erstwhile speckless and gleaming  shirt front were number of finger-impressions, of a boldness and  clearness of outline which would have made a Bertillon expert leap with  joy.    'Hullo!' said Mike dropping his book.    Psmith nodded in silence, went to his bedroom, and returned with a  looking-glass. Propping this up on a table, he proceeded to examine  himself with the utmost care. He shuddered slightly as his eye fell on  the finger-marks; and without a word he went into his bathroom again.  He emerged after an interval of ten minutes in sky-blue pyjamas,  slippers, and an Old Etonian blazer. He lit a cigarette; and, sitting  down, stared pensively into the fire.    'What the dickens have you been playing at?' demanded Mike.    Psmith heaved a sigh.    'That,' he replied, 'I could not say precisely. At one moment it seemed  to be Rugby football, at another a jiu-jitsu _seance_. Later, it  bore a resemblance to a pantomime rally. However, whatever it was, it  was all very bright and interesting. A distinct experience.'    'Have you been scrapping?' asked Mike. 'What happened? Was there a  row?'    'There was,' said Psmith, 'in a measure what might be described as a  row. At least, when you find a perfect stranger attaching himself to  your collar and pulling, you begin to suspect that something of that  kind is on the bill.'    'Did they do that?'    Psmith nodded.    'A merchant in a moth-eaten bowler started warbling to a certain extent  with me. It was all very trying for a man of culture. He was a man who  had, I should say, discovered that alcohol was a food long before the  doctors found it out. A good chap, possibly, but a little boisterous in  his manner. Well, well.'    Psmith shook his head sadly.    'He got you one on the forehead,' said Mike, 'or somebody did. Tell us  what happened. I wish the dickens I'd come with you. I'd no notion  there would be a rag of any sort. What did happen?'    'Comrade Jackson,' said Psmith sorrowfully, 'how sad it is in this life  of ours to be consistently misunderstood. You know, of course, how  wrapped up I am in Comrade Bickersdyke's welfare. You know that all my  efforts are directed towards making a decent man of him; that, in  short, I am his truest friend. Does he show by so much as a word that  he appreciates my labours? Not he. I believe that man is beginning to  dislike me, Comrade Jackson.'    'What happened, anyhow? Never mind about Bickersdyke.'    'Perhaps it was mistaken zeal on my part.... Well, I will tell you all.  Make a long arm for the shovel, Comrade Jackson, and pile on a few more  coals. I thank you. Well, all went quite smoothly for a while. Comrade  B. in quite good form. Got his second wind, and was going strong for the  tape, when a regrettable incident occurred. He informed the meeting,  that while up in the Lake country, fishing, he went to an inn and saw  a remarkably large stuffed trout in a glass case. He made inquiries,  and found that five separate and distinct people had caught--'    'Why, dash it all,' said Mike, 'that's a frightful chestnut.'    Psmith nodded.    'It certainly has appeared in print,' he said. 'In fact I should have  said it was rather a well-known story. I was so interested in Comrade  Bickersdyke's statement that the thing had happened to himself that,  purely out of good-will towards him, I got up and told him that I  thought it was my duty, as a friend, to let him know that a man named  Jerome had pinched his story, put it in a book, and got money by it.  Money, mark you, that should by rights have been Comrade Bickersdyke's.  He didn't appear to care much about sifting the matter thoroughly. In  fact, he seemed anxious to get on with his speech, and slur the"]]]
