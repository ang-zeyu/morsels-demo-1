The investigator may even be excused if he  stands dumb with awe before the creation of his own intellect. Our  accurate records of the operations of nature extend through only two or  three centuries, and do not reach a satisfactory standard until within  a single century. The experience of the individual is limited to a few  years, and beyond this period he must depend upon the records of his  ancestors. All his knowledge of the laws of nature is derived from this  very limited experience. How can he essay to describe what may have  been going on hundreds of millions of years in the past? Can he dare to  say that nature was the same then as now?    It is a fundamental principle of the theory of evolution, as developed  by its greatest recent expounder, that matter itself is eternal, and  that all the changes which have taken place in the universe, so far as  made up of matter, are in the nature of transformations of this eternal  substance. But we doubt whether any physical philosopher of the present  day would be satisfied to accept any demonstration of the eternity of  matter. All he would admit is that, so far as his observation goes, no  change in the quantity of matter can be produced by the action of any  known cause. It seems to be equally uncreatable and indestructible. But  he would, at the same time, admit that his experience no more sufficed  to settle the question than the observation of an animal for a single  day would settle the question of the duration of its life, or prove  that it had neither beginning nor end. He would probably admit that  even matter itself may be a product of evolution. The astronomer finds  it difficult to conceive that the great nebulous masses which he sees  in the celestial spaces--millions of times larger than the whole solar  system, yet so tenuous that they offer not the slightest obstruction to  the passage of a ray of light through their whole length--situated in  what seems to be a region of eternal cold, below anything that we can  produce on the earth's surface, yet radiating light, and with it heat,  like an incandescent body--can be made up of the same kind of substance  that we have around us on the earth's surface. Who knows but that the  radiant property that Becquerel has found in certain forms of matter  may be a residuum of some original form of energy which is inherent in  great cosmical masses, and has fed our sun during all the ages required  by the geologist for the structure of the earth's crusts? It may be  that in this phenomenon we have the key to the great riddle of the  universe, with which profounder secrets of matter than any we have  penetrated will be opened to the eyes of our successors.          IV    THE EXTENT OF THE UNIVERSE      We cannot expect that the wisest men of our remotest posterity, who can  base their conclusions upon thousands of years of accurate observation,  will reach a decision on this subject without some measure of reserve.  Such being the case, it might appear the dictate of wisdom to leave its  consideration to some future age, when it may be taken up with better  means of information than we now possess. But the question is one which  will refuse to be postponed so long as the propensity to think of the  possibilities of creation is characteristic of our race. The issue is  not whether we shall ignore the question altogether, like Eve in the  presence of Raphael; but whether in studying it we shall confine our  speculations within the limits set by sound scientific reasoning.  Essaying to do this, I invite the reader's attention to what science  may suggest, admitting in advance that the sphere of exact knowledge is  small compared with the possibilities of creation, and that outside  this sphere we can state only more or less probable conclusions.    The reader who desires to approach this subject in the most receptive  spirit should begin his study by betaking himself on a clear, moonless  evening, when he has no earthly concern to disturb the serenity of his  thoughts, to some point where he can lie on his back on bench or roof,  and scan the whole vault of heaven at one view. He can do this with the  greatest pleasure and profit in late summer or autumn--winter would do  equally well were it possible for the mind to rise so far above bodily  conditions that the question of temperature should not enter. The  thinking man who does this under circumstances most favorable for calm  thought will form a new conception of the wonder of the universe. If  summer or autumn be chosen, the stupendous arch of the Milky Way will  pass near the zenith, and the constellation Lyra, led by its beautiful  blue Vega of the first magnitude, may be not very far from that point.  South of it will be seen the constellation Aquila, marked by the bright  Altair, between two smaller but conspicuous stars. The bright Arcturus  will be somewhere in the west, and, if the observation is not made too  early in the season, Aldebaran will be seen somewhere in the east. When  attention is concentrated on the scene the thousands of stars on each  side of the Milky Way will fill the mind with the consciousness of a  stupendous and all-embracing frame, beside which all human affairs sink  into insignificance. A new idea will be formed of such a well-known  fact of astronomy as the motion of the solar system in space, by  reflecting that, during all human history, the sun, carrying the earth  with it, has been flying towards a region in or just south of the  constellation Lyra, with a speed beyond all that art can produce on  earth, without producing any change apparent to ordinary vision in the  aspect of the constellation. Not only Lyra and Aquila, but every one of  the thousand stars which form the framework of the sky, were seen by  our earliest ancestors just as we see them now. Bodily rest may be  obtained at any time by ceasing from our labors, and weary systems may  find nerve rest at any summer resort; but I know of no way in which  complete rest can be obtained for the weary soul--in which the mind can  be so entirely relieved of the burden of all human anxiety--as by the  contemplation of the spectacle presented by the starry heavens under  the conditions just described. As we make a feeble attempt to learn  what science can tell us about the structure of this starry frame, I  hope the reader will allow me to at least fancy him contemplating it in  this way.    The first question which may suggest itself to the inquiring reader is:  How is it possible by any methods of observation yet known to the  astronomer to learn anything about the universe as a whole? We may  commence by answering this question in a somewhat comprehensive way. It  is possible only because the universe, vast though it is, shows certain  characteristics of a unified and bounded whole. It is not a chaos, it  is not even a collection of things, each of which came into existence  in its own separate way. If it were, there would be nothing in common  between two widely separate regions of the universe. But, as a matter  of fact, science shows unity in the whole structure, and diversity only  in details. The Milky Way itself will be seen by the most ordinary  observer to form a single structure. This structure is, in some sort,  the foundation on which the universe is built. It is a girdle which  seems to span the whole of creation, so far as our telescopes have yet  enabled us to determine what creation is; and yet it has elements of  similarity in all its parts. What has yet more significance, it is in  some respects unlike those parts of the universe which lie without it,  and even unlike those which lie in that central region within it where  our system is now situated. The minute stars, individually far beyond  the limit of visibility to the naked eye, which form its cloudlike  agglomerations, are found to be mostly bluer in color, from one extreme  to the other, than the general average of the stars which make up the  rest of the universe.    In the preceding essay on the structure of the universe, we have  pointed out several features of the universe showing the unity of the  whole. We shall now bring together these and other features with a view  of showing their relation to the question of the extent of the universe.    The Milky Way being in a certain sense the foundation on which the  whole system is constructed, we have first to notice the symmetry of  the whole. This is seen in the fact that a certain resemblance is found  in any two opposite regions of the sky, no matter where we choose them.  If we take them in the Milky Way, the stars are more numerous than  elsewhere; if we take opposite regions in or near the Milky Way, we  shall find more stars in both of them than elsewhere; if we take them  in the region anywhere around the poles of the Milky Way, we shall find  fewer stars, but they will be equally numerous in each of the two  regions. We infer from this that whatever cause determined the number  of the stars in space was of the same nature in every two antipodal  regions of the heavens.    Another unity marked with yet more precision is seen in the chemical  elements of which stars are composed. We know that the sun is composed  of the same elements which we find on the earth and into which we  resolve compounds in our laboratories. These same elements are found in  the most distant stars. It is true that some of these bodies seem to  contain elements which we do not find on earth. But as these unknown  elements are scattered from one extreme of the universe to the other,  they only serve still further to enforce the unity which runs through  the whole. The nebulae are composed, in part at least, of forms of  matter dissimilar to any with which we are acquainted. But, different  though they may be, they are alike in their general character  throughout the whole field we are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4069"],[0,"The Dawn of Canadian History : A Chronicle of Aboriginal Canada (#11)"],[1,"lying off the north shore of the Gulf of St  Lawrence. But these fishing crews thought nothing of exploration. The  harvest of the sea was their sole care, and beyond landing to cure fish  and to obtain wood and water they did nothing to claim or conquer the  land.    There were, however, efforts from time to time to follow up the  discoveries of the Cabots. The merchants of Bristol do not seem to have  been disappointed with the result of the Cabot enterprises, for as  early as in 1501 they sent out a new expedition across the Atlantic.  The sanction of the king was again invoked, and Henry VII granted  letters patent to three men of Bristol--Richard Warde, Thomas  Ashehurst, and John Thomas--to explore the western seas. These names  have a homely English sound; but associated with them were three  Portuguese--John Gonzales, and two men called Fernandez, all of the  Azores, and probably of the class of master-pilots to which the Cabots  and Columbus belonged. We know nothing of the results of the  expedition, but it returned in safety in the same year, and the  parsimonious king was moved to pay out five pounds from his treasury  'to the men of Bristol that found the isle.'    Francis Fernandez and John Gonzales remained in the English service and  became subjects of King Henry. Again, in the summer of 1502, they were  sent out on another voyage from Bristol. In September they brought  their ships safely back, and, in proof of the strangeness of the new  lands they carried home 'three men brought out of an Iland forre beyond  Irelond, the which were clothed in Beestes Skynnes and ate raw fflesh  and were rude in their demeanure as Beestes.' From this description  (written in an old atlas of the time), it looks as if the Fernandez  expedition had turned north from the Great Banks and visited the coast  where the Eskimos were found, either in Labrador or Greenland. This  time Henry VII gave Fernandez and Gonzales a pension of ten pounds  each, and made them 'captains' of the New Found Land. A sum of twenty  pounds was given to the merchants of Bristol who had accompanied them.  We must remember that at this time the New Found Land was the general  name used for all the northern coast of America.    There is evidence that a further expedition went out from Bristol in  1503, and still another in 1504. Fernandez and Gonzales, with two  English associates, were again the leaders. They were to have a  monopoly of trade for forty years, but were cautioned not to interfere  with the territory of the king of Portugal. Of the fate of these  enterprises nothing is known.    By the time of Henry VIII, who began to reign in 1509, the annual  fishing fleet of the English which sailed to the American coast had  become important. As early as in 1522, a royal ship of war was sent to  the mouth of the English Channel to protect the 'coming home of the New  Found Island's fleet.' Henry VIII and his minister, Cardinal Wolsey,  were evidently anxious to go on with the work of the previous reign,  and especially to enlist the wealthy merchants and trade companies of  London in the cause of western exploration. In 1521 the cardinal  proposed to the Livery Companies of London--the name given to the trade  organizations of the merchants--that they should send out five ships on  a voyage into the New Found Land. When the merchants seemed disinclined  to make such a venture, the king 'spake sharply to the Mayor to see it  put in execution to the best of his power.' But, even with this  stimulus, several years passed before a London expedition was sent out.  At last, in 1527, two little ships called the Samson and the Mary of  Guildford set out from London with instructions to find their way to  Cathay and the Indies by means of the passage to the north. The two  ships left London on May 10, put into Plymouth, and finally sailed  therefrom on June 10, 1527. They followed Cabot's track, striking  westward from the coast of Ireland. For three weeks they kept together,  making good progress across the Atlantic. Then in a great storm that  arose the Samson was lost with all on board.    The Mary of Guildford pursued her way alone, and her crew had  adventures strange even for those days. Her course, set well to the  north, brought her into the drift ice and the giant icebergs which are  carried down the coast of America at this season (for the month was  July) from the polar seas. In fear of the moving ice, she turned to the  south, the sailors watching eagerly for the land, and sounding as they  went. Four days brought them to the coast of Labrador. They followed it  southward for some days. Presently they entered an inlet where they  found a good harbour, many small islands, and the mouth of a great  river of fresh water. The region was a wilderness, its mountains and  woods apparently untenanted by man. Near the shore they saw the  footmarks of divers great beasts, but, though they explored the country  for about thirty miles, they saw neither men nor animals. At the end of  July, they set sail again, and passed down the coast of Newfoundland to  the harbour of St John's, already a well-known rendezvous. Here they  found fourteen ships of the fishing fleet, mostly vessels from  Normandy. From Newfoundland the Mary of Guildford pursued her way  southward, and passed along the Atlantic coast of America. If she had  had any one on board capable of accurate observation, even after the  fashion of the time, or of making maps, the record of her voyage would  have added much to the general knowledge of the continent.  Unfortunately, the Italian pilot who directed the voyage was killed in  a skirmish with Indians during a temporary landing. Some have thought  that this pilot who perished on the Mary of Guildford may have been the  great navigator Verrazano, of whom we shall presently speak.    The little vessel sailed down the coast to the islands of the West  Indies. She reached Porto Rico in the middle of November, and from that  island she made sail for the new Spanish settlements of San Domingo.  Here, as she lay at her anchorage, the Mary of Guildford was fired upon  by the Spanish fort which commanded the river mouth. At once she put  out into the open sea, and, heading eastward across the Atlantic, she  arrived safely at her port of London.        CHAPTER VI    FORERUNNERS OF JACQUES CARTIER    We have seen that after the return of the second expedition of the  Cabots no voyages to the coasts of Canada of first-rate importance were  made by the English. This does not mean, however, that nothing was done  by other peoples to discover and explore the northern coasts of  America. The Portuguese were the first after the Cabots to continue the  search along the Canadian coast for the secret of the hidden East. At  this time, we must remember, the Portuguese were one of the leading  nations of Europe, and they were specially interested in maritime  enterprise. Thanks to Columbus, the Spaniards had, it is true, carried  off the grand prize of discovery. But the Portuguese had rendered  service not less useful. From their coasts, jutting far out into the  Atlantic, they had sailed southward and eastward, and had added much to  the knowledge of the globe. For generations, both before and after  Columbus, the pilots and sailors of Portugal were among the most  successful and daring in the world.    For nearly a hundred years before the discovery of America the  Portuguese had been endeavouring to find an ocean route to the spice  islands of the East and to the great Oriental empires which, tradition  said, lay far off on a distant ocean, and which Marco Polo and other  travellers had reached by years of painful land travel across the  interior of Asia. Prince Henry of Portugal was busy with these tasks at  the middle of the fifteenth century. Even before this, Portuguese  sailors had found their way to the Madeiras and the Canary Islands, and  to the Azores, which lie a thousand miles out in the Atlantic. But  under the lead of Prince Henry they began to grope their way down the  coast of Africa, braving the torrid heats and awful calms of that  equatorial region, where the blazing sun, poised overhead in a  cloudless sky, was reflected on the bosom of a stagnant and glistening  ocean. It was their constant hope that at some point the land would be  found to roll back and disclose an ocean pathway round Africa to the  East, the goal of their desire. Year after year they advanced farther,  until at last they achieved a momentous result. In 1487, Bartholomew  Diaz sailed round the southern point of Africa, which received the  significant name of the 'Cape of Good Hope,' and entered the Indian  Ocean. Henceforth a water pathway to the Far East was possible.  Following Diaz, Vasco da Gama, leaving Lisbon in 1497, sailed round the  south of Africa, and, reaching the ports of Hindustan, made the  maritime route to India a definite reality.    Thus at the moment when the Spaniards were taking possession of the  western world the Portuguese were establishing their trade in the  rediscovered East. The two nations agreed to divide between them these  worlds of the East and the West. They invoked the friendly offices of  the Pope as mediator, and, henceforth, an imaginary line drawn down the  Atlantic divided the realms. At first this arrangement seemed to give  Spain all the new regions in America, but the line of division was set  so far to the West that the discovery of Brazil, which juts out  eastward into the Atlantic, gave the Portuguese a vast territory in  South America. At the time of which we are now speaking, however, the  Portuguese were intent upon their interests in the Orient. Their great  aim was to pass beyond India, already reached by da Gama, to the  further empires of China and Japan. Like other navigators of the time,  they thought that these places might be reached not merely by southern  but also by the northern seas. Hence it"]]]
