It was not  fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the  untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she  couldn't get their drift; and when she was making the honest best  drive at it she could, too, and no fault of hers that she couldn't  fetch the home plate; and so I apologized.  Then we meandered  pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse  together, and better friends than ever.    I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence  for this girl; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station  and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless  transcontinental sentences of hers, it was borne in upon me that  I was standing in the awful presence of the Mother of the German  Language.  I was so impressed with this, that sometimes when she  began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took  the very attitude of reverence, and stood uncovered; and if words  had been water, I had been drowned, sure.  She had exactly the  German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered, whether a  mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the history of a war,  she would get it into a single sentence or die.  Whenever the literary  German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to see  of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his  verb in his mouth.    We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon.  It was a most  strange menagerie.  The chief emulation among them seemed to be,  to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous  with vermin.  Their manner and attitudes were the last expression  of complacent self-righteousness.  It was one anchorite's pride  to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister  him unmolested; it was another's to lean against a rock, all day  long, conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims  and pray; it was another's to go naked and crawl around on all fours;  it was another's to drag about with him, year in and year out,  eighty pounds of iron; it was another's to never lie down when  he slept, but to stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there  were pilgrims around to look; a woman, who had the white hair of  age, and no other apparel, was black from crown to heel with  forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water.  Groups of gazing  pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects, lost  in reverent wonder, and envious of the fleckless sanctity which  these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven.    By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones.  He was  a mighty celebrity; his fame had penetrated all Christendom; the  noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe  to pay him reverence.  His stand was in the center of the widest part  of the valley; and it took all that space to hold his crowds.    His stand was a pillar sixty feet high, with a broad platform on  the top of it.  He was now doing what he had been doing every day  for twenty years up there--bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly  almost to his feet.  It was his way of praying.  I timed him with a  stop watch, and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and  46 seconds.  It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste.  It was one of the most useful motions in mechanics, the pedal  movement; so I made a note in my memorandum book, purposing some  day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing  machine with it.  I afterward carried out that scheme, and got  five years' good service out of him; in which time he turned out  upward of eighteen thousand first-rate tow-linen shirts, which  was ten a day.  I worked him Sundays and all; he was going, Sundays,  the same as week days, and it was no use to waste the power.  These shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the  materials--I furnished those myself, it would not have been right  to make him do that--and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a  dollar and a half apiece, which was the price of fifty cows or  a blooded race horse in Arthurdom.  They were regarded as a perfect  protection against sin, and advertised as such by my knights  everywhere, with the paint-pot and stencil-plate; insomuch that  there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in England but  you could read on it at a mile distance:    \"Buy the only genuine St. Stylite; patronized by the Nobility.  Patent applied for.\"    There was more money in the business than one knew what to do with.  As it extended, I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings,  and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort, with ruffles down  the forehatch and the running-gear clewed up with a featherstitch  to leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with  a half-turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather-gaskets.  Yes, it was a daisy.    But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to  standing on one leg, and I found that there was something the matter  with the other one; so I stocked the business and unloaded, taking  Sir Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his  friends; for the works stopped within a year, and the good saint  got him to his rest.  But he had earned it.  I can say that for him.    When I saw him that first time--however, his personal condition  will not quite bear description here.  You can read it in the  Lives of the Saints.*    [*All the details concerning the hermits, in this chapter, are from  Lecky--but greatly modified.

It is worthy of remark that in this voyage, far anterior to that of  Orellana, and consequently the greatest which the Spaniards had then  performed on a river of the New World, the name of the Orinoco was for  the first time heard. Ordaz, the leader of the expedition, affirms  that the river, from its mouth as far as the confluence of the Meta,  is called Uriaparia, but that above this confluence it bears the name  of Orinucu. This word (formed analogously with the words Tamanacu,  Otomacu, Sinarucu) is, in fact, of the Tamanac tongue; and, as the  Tamanacs dwell south-east of Encaramada, it is natural that the  conquistadores heard the actual name of the river only on drawing near  the Rio Meta.* (* Gili volume 3 page 381. The following are the most  ancient names of the Orinoco, known to the natives near its mouth, and  which historians give us altered by the double fault of pronunciation  and orthography; Yuyapari, Yjupari, Huriaparia, Urapari, Viapari, Rio  de Paria. The Tamanac word Orinucu was disfigured by the Dutch pilots  into Worinoque. The Otomacs say Joga-apurura (great river); the Cabres  and Guaypunabis, Paragua, Bazagua Parava, three words signifying great  water, river, sea. That part of the Orinoco between the Apure and the  Guaviare is often denoted by the name of Baraguan. A famous strait,  which we have described above, bears also this name, which is no doubt  a corruption of the word Paragua. Great rivers in every zone are  called by the dwellers on their banks the river, without any  particular denominations. If other names be added, they change in  every province. Thus the Rio Turiva, near the Encaramada, has five  names in the different parts of its course. The Upper Orinoco, or  Paragua, is called by the Maquiritares (near Esmeralda) Maraguaca, on  account of the lofty mountains of this name near Duida. Gili volume 1  pages 22 and 364. Caulin page 75. In most of the names of the rivers  of America we recognize the root water. Thus yacu in the Peruvian, and  veni in the Maypure tongues, signify water and river. In the Lule  dialect I find fo, water; foyavolto, a river; foysi, a lake; as in  Persian, ab is water; abi frat, the river Euphrates; abdan, a lake.  The root water is preserved in the derivatives.) On this last  tributary stream Diego de Ordaz received from the natives the first  idea of civilized nations who inhabited the table-lands of the Andes  of New Granada; of a very powerful prince with one eye (Indio tuerto),  and of animals less than stags, but fit for riding like Spanish  horses. Ordaz had no idea that these animals were llamas (ovejas del  Peru). Must we admit that llamas, which were used in the Andes to draw  the plough and as beasts of burden, but not for riding, were already  common on the north and east of Quito? I find that Orellana saw these  animals at the river Amazon, above the confluence of the Rio Negro,  consequently in a climate very different from that of the table-land  of the Andes. The table of an army of Omaguas mounted on llamas served  to embellish the account given by the fellow-travellers of Felipe de  Urre of their adventurous expedition to the Upper Caqueta. We cannot  be sufficiently attentive to these traditions, which seem to prove  that the domestic animals of Quito and Peru had already begun to  descend the Cordilleras, and spread themselves by degrees in the  eastern regions of South America.    Herrera, the treasurer of the expedition of Ordaz, was sent in 1553,  by the governor Geronimo de Ortal, to pursue the discovery of the  Orinoco and the Meta. He lost nearly thirteen months between Punta  Barina and the confluence of the Carony in constructing flat-bottomed  boats, and making the preparations indispensable for a long voyage. We  cannot read without astonishment the narrative of those daring  enterprises, in which three or four hundred horses were embarked to be  put ashore whenever cavalry could act on one of the banks. We find in  the expedition of Herrera the same stations which we already knew; the  fortress of Paria, the Indian village of Uriaparia (no doubt below  Imataca, on a point where the inundations of the delta prevented the  Spaniards from being able to procure firewood), Caroa, in the province  of Carora; the rivers Caranaca (Caura?) and Caxavana (Cuchivero?); the  village of Cabritu (Cabruta), and the Raudal near the mouth of the  Meta (probably the Raudal of Cariven and the Piedra de la Paciencia).  As the Rio Meta, on account of the proximity of its sources and of its  tributary streams to the auriferous Cordilleras of new Grenada  (Cundinamarca), enjoyed great celebrity, Herrera attempted to go up  this river. He there found nations more civilized than those of the  Orinoco, but that fed on the flesh of mute dogs. Herrera was killed in  battle by an arrow poisoned with the juice of curare (yierva); and  when dying named Alvaro de Ordaz his lieutenant, who led the remains  of the expedition (1535) to the fortress of Paria, after having lost  the few horses which had resisted a campaign of eighteen months.    Confused reports which were circulated of the wealth of the  inhabitants of the Meta, and the other tributary streams that descend  from the eastern side of the Cordilleras of New Grenada, engaged  successively Geronimo de Ortal, Nicolas Federmann, and Jorge de Espira  (George von Speier), in 1535 and 1536, to undertake expeditions by  land towards the south and south-west. From the promontory of Paria,  as far as Cabo de la Vela, little figures of molten gold had been  found in the hands of the natives, as early as the years 1498 and  1500. The principal markets for these amulets, which the women used as  ornaments, were the villages of Curiana (Coro) and Cauchieto (Near the  Rio la Hacha). The metal employed by the founders of Cauchieto came  from a mountainous country more to the south. It may be conceived that  the expeditions of Ordaz and Herrera served to increase the desire of  drawing nearer to those auriferous countries. George von Speier left  Coro (1535), and penetrated by the mountains of Merida to the banks of  the Apure and the Meta. He passed these two rivers near their sources,  where they have but little breadth. The Indians told him that, farther  on, white men wandered about the plains. Speier, who imagined that he  was not far from the banks of the Amazon, had no doubt that these  wandering Spaniards were men unfortunately shipwrecked in the  expedition of Ordaz. He crossed the savannahs of San Juan de los  Llanos, which were said to abound in gold; and made a long stay at an  Indian village called Pueblo de Nuestra Senora, and afterwards La  Fragua, south-east of the Paramo de la Suma Paz. I have been on the  western back of this group of mountains, at Fusagasuga, and there  heard that the plains by which they are skirted toward the east still  enjoy some celebrity for wealth among the natives. Speier found in the  populous village of La Fragua a Casa del Sol (temple of the sun), and  a convent of virgins similar to those of Peru and New Granada. Were  these the consequence of a migration of religious rites towards the  east? or must we admit that the plains of San Juan were their first  cradle? Tradition, indeed, records that Bochica, the legislator of New  Granada and high-priest of Iraca, had gone up from the plains of the  east to the table-land of Bogota. But Bochica being at once the  offspring and the symbol of the sun, his history may contain  allegories that are merely astrological. Speier, pursuing his way  toward the south, and crossing the two branches of the Guaviare, which  are the Ariare and the Guayavero (Guayare or Canicamare), arrived on  the banks of the great Rio Papamene or Caqueta. The resistance he met  with during a whole year in the province de los Choques, put an end,  in 1537, to this memorable expedition. Nicolas Federmann and Geronimo  de Ortal (1536), who went from Macarapana and the mouth of the Rio  Neveri, followed (1535) the traces of Jorge de Espira. The former  sought for gold in the Rio Grande de la Magdalena; the latter  endeavoured to discover a temple of the sun (Casa del Sol) on the  banks of the Meta. Ignorant of the idiom of the natives, they seemed  to see everywhere, at the foot of the Cordilleras, the reflexion of  the greatness of the temples of Iraca (Sogamozo), which was then the  centre of the civilization of Cundinamarca.    I have now examined, in a geographical point of view, the expeditions  on the Orinoco, and in a western and southern direction on the eastern  back of the Andes, before the tradition of El Dorado was spread among  the conquistadores. This tradition, as we have noticed above, had its  origin in the kingdom of Quito, where Luis Daza (1535) met with an  Indian of New Grenada who had been sent by his prince (no doubt the  zippa of Bogota, or the zaque of Tunja), to demand assistance from  Atahualpa, inca of Peru. This ambassador boasted, as is usual, the  wealth of his country; but what particularly fixed the attention of  the Spaniards who were assembled with Daza in the town of Tacunga  (Llactacunga), was the history of a lord who, his body covered with  powdered gold, went into a lake amid the mountains. This lake may have  been the Laguna de Totta, a little to the east of Sogamozo (Iraca) and  of Tunja (Hunca, the town of Huncahua), where two chiefs,  ecclesiastical and secular, of the empire of Cundinamarca, or  Cundirumarca, resided; but no historical remembrance being attached to  this mountain lake, I rather suppose that it was the sacred lake of  Guatavita, on the east of the mines of rock-salt of Zipaquira, into  which the gilded lord was made to enter. I saw on its banks the  remains of a staircase hewn in the rock, and serving for the  ceremonies of ablution. The Indians said that powder of gold and  golden vessels were thrown into this lake, as a"]]]
