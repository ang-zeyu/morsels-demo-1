But the people ought to  be made one, and a community, as I have already said, by education;  as property at Lacedaemon, and their public tables at Crete, were made  common by their legislators. But yet, whosoever shall introduce any  education, and think thereby to make his city excellent and respectable,  will be absurd, while he expects to form it by such regulations, and not  by manners, philosophy, and laws. And whoever [1264a] would establish  a government upon a community of goods, ought to know that he should  consult the experience of many years, which would plainly enough inform  him whether such a scheme is useful; for almost all things have already  been found out, but some have been neglected, and others which have been  known have not been put in practice. But this would be most evident, if  any one could see such a government really established: for it would be  impossible to frame such a city without dividing and separating it into  its distinct parts, as public tables, wards, and tribes; so that here  the laws will do nothing more than forbid the military to engage  in agriculture, which is what the Lacedaemonians are at present  endeavouring to do.    Nor has Socrates told us (nor is it easy to say) what plan of government  should be pursued with respect to the individuals in the state where  there is a community of goods established; for though the majority  of his citizens will in general consist of a multitude of persons of  different occupations, of those he has determined nothing; whether the  property of the husbandman ought to be in common, or whether each person  should have his share to himself; and also, whether their wives and  children ought to be in common: for if all things are to be alike common  to all, where will be the difference between them and the military, or  what would they get by submitting to their government? and upon what  principles would they do it, unless they should establish the wise  practice of the Cretans? for they, allowing everything else to their  slaves, forbid them only gymnastic exercises and the use of arms. And if  they are not, but these should be in the same situation with respect to  their property which they are in other cities, what sort of a community  will there be? in one city there must of necessity be two, and those  contrary to each other; for he makes the military the guardians of the  state, and the husbandman, artisans, and others, citizens; and all those  quarrels, accusations, and things of the like sort, which he says are  the bane of other cities, will be found in his also: notwithstanding  Socrates says they will not want many laws in consequence of their  education, but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets,  the markets, and the like, while at the same time it is the education of  the military only that he has taken any care of. Besides, he makes the  husbandmen masters of property upon paying a tribute; but this would  be likely to make them far more troublesome and high-spirited than the  Helots, the Penestise, or the slaves which others employ; nor has he  ever determined whether it is necessary to give any attention to them  in these particulars, nor thought of what is connected therewith,  their polity, their education, their laws; besides, it is of no little  consequence, nor is it easy to determine, how these should be framed so  as to preserve the community of the military.    Besides, if he makes the wives common, while the property [1264b]  continues separate, who shall manage the domestic concerns with the same  care which the man bestows upon his fields? nor will the inconvenience  be remedied by making property as well as wives common; and it is absurd  to draw a comparison from the brute creation, and say, that the same  principle should regulate the connection of a man and a woman which  regulates theirs amongst whom there is no family association.    It is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy as Socrates has  done; for he would have persons of the same rank always in office, which  becomes the cause of sedition even amongst those who are of no account,  but more particularly amongst those who are of a courageous and warlike  disposition; it is indeed evidently necessary that he should frame his  community in this manner; for that golden particle which God has mixed  up in the soul of man flies not from one to the other, but always  continues with the same; for he says, that some of our species have  gold, and others silver, blended in their composition from the moment of  their birth: but those who are to be husbandmen and artists, brass and  iron; besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says,  that the legislator ought to make all the citizens happy; but it  is impossible that the whole city can be happy, without all, or the  greater, or some part of it be happy. For happiness is not like  that numerical equality which arises from certain numbers when added  together, although neither of them may separately contain it; for  happiness cannot be thus added together, but must exist in every  individual, as some properties belong to every integral; and if the  military are not happy, who else are so? for the artisans are not, nor  the multitude of those who are employed in inferior offices. The state  which Socrates has described has all these defects, and others which are  not of less consequence.          CHAPTER VI      It is also nearly the same in the treatise upon Laws which was writ  afterwards, for which reason it will be proper in this place to consider  briefly what he has there said upon government, for Socrates has  thoroughly settled but very few parts of it; as for instance, in what  manner the community of wives and children ought to be regulated, how  property should be established, and government conducted.    Now he divides the inhabitants into two parts, husbandmen and soldiers,  and from these he select a third part who are to be senators and govern  the city; but he has not said whether or no the husbandman and artificer  shall have any or what share in the government, or whether they shall  have arms, and join with the others in war, or not. He thinks also  that the women ought to go to war, and have the same education as the  soldiers; as to other particulars, he has filled his treatise with  matter foreign to the purpose; and with respect to education, he has  only said what that of the guards ought to be.    [1265a] As to his book of Laws, laws are the principal thing which that  contains, for he has there said but little concerning government; and  this government, which he was so desirous of framing in such a manner as  to impart to its members a more entire community of goods than is to be  found in other cities, he almost brings round again to be the same  as that other government which he had first proposed; for except the  community of wives and goods, he has framed both his governments alike,  for the education of the citizens is to be the same in both; they are in  both to live without any servile employ, and their common tables are to  be the same, excepting that in that he says the women should have common  tables, and that there should be a thousand men-at-arms, in this, that  there should be five thousand.    All the discourses of Socrates are masterly, noble, new, and  inquisitive; but that they are all true it may probably be too much  to say. For now with respect to the number just spoken of, it must be  acknowledged that he would want the country of Babylonia for them, or  some one like it, of an immeasurable extent, to support five thousand  idle persons, besides a much greater number of women and servants. Every  one, it is true, may frame an hypothesis as he pleases, but yet it ought  to be possible. It has been said, that a legislator should have two  things in view when he frames his laws, the country and the people. He  will also do well, if he has some regard to the neighbouring states, if  he intends that his community should maintain any political intercourse  with them, for it is not only necessary that they should understand that  practice of war which is adapted to their own country, but to others  also; for admitting that any one chooses not this life either in  public or private, yet there is not the less occasion for their being  formidable to their enemies, not only when they invade their country,  but also when they retire out of it.    It may also be considered whether the quantity of each person's property  may not be settled in a different manner from what he has done it in,  by making it more determinate; for he says, that every one ought to have  enough whereon to live moderately, as if any one had said to live well,  which is the most comprehensive expression. Besides, a man may live  moderately and miserably at the same time; he had therefore better  have proposed, that they should live both moderately and liberally;  for unless these two conspire, luxury will come in on the one hand, or  wretchedness on the other, since these two modes of living are the only  ones applicable to the employment of our substance; for we cannot say  with respect to a man's fortune, that he is mild or courageous, but we  may say that he is prudent and liberal, which are the only qualities  connected therewith.    It is also absurd to render property equal, and not to provide for  the increasing number of the citizens; but to leave that circumstance  uncertain, as if it would regulate itself according to the number of  women who [1265b] should happen to be childless, let that be what it  would because this seems to take place in other cities; but the case  would not be the same in such a state which he proposes and those which  now actually unite; for in these no one actually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763"],[0,"Aristotle on the art of poetry (#11)"],[1," agent--whether he does it to attain a greater good, or to  avoid a greater evil.    III. Other criticisms one must meet by considering the language of the  poet: (1) by the assumption of a strange word in a passage like _oureas  men proton_, where by _oureas_ Homer may perhaps mean not mules but  sentinels. And in saying of Dolon, _hos p e toi eidos men heen kakos_,  his meaning may perhaps be, not that Dolon's body was deformed, but that  his face was ugly, as _eneidos_ is the Cretan word for handsome-faced.  So, too, _goroteron de keraie_ may mean not 'mix the wine stronger', as  though for topers, but 'mix it quicker'. (2) Other expressions in Homer  may be explained as metaphorical; e.g. in _halloi men ra theoi te kai  aneres eudon (hapantes) pannux_ as compared with what he tells us at the  same time, _e toi hot hes pedion to Troikon hathreseien, aulon suriggon  *te homadon*_ the word _hapantes_ 'all', is metaphorically put for  'many', since 'all' is a species of 'many '. So also his _oie d'  ammoros_ is metaphorical, the best known standing 'alone'. (3) A change,  as Hippias suggested, in the mode of reading a word will solve the  difficulty in _didomen de oi_, and _to men ou kataputhetai hombro_.  (4) Other difficulties may be solved by another punctuation; e.g. in  Empedocles, _aipsa de thnet ephyonto, ta prin mathon athanata xora te  prin kekreto_. Or (5) by the assumption of an equivocal term, as in  _parocheken de pleo nux_, where _pleo_ in equivocal. Or (6) by an appeal  to the custom of language. Wine-and-water we call 'wine'; and it is  on the same principle that Homer speaks of a _knemis neoteuktou  kassiteroio_, a 'greave of new-wrought tin.' A worker in iron we call a  'brazier'; and it is on the same principle that Ganymede is described  as the 'wine-server' of Zeus, though the Gods do not drink wine. This  latter, however, may be an instance of metaphor. But whenever also a  word seems to imply some contradiction, it is necessary to reflect how  many ways there may be of understanding it in the passage in question;  e.g. in Homer's _te r' hesxeto xalkeon hegxos_ one should consider the  possible senses of 'was stopped there'--whether by taking it in this  sense or in that one will best avoid the fault of which Glaucon speaks:  'They start with some improbable presumption; and having so decreed it  themselves, proceed to draw inferences, and censure the poet as though  he had actually said whatever they happen to believe, if his statement  conflicts with their own notion of things.' This is how Homer's silence  about Icarius has been treated. Starting with, the notion of his having  been a Lacedaemonian, the critics think it strange for Telemachus not to  have met him when he went to Lacedaemon. Whereas the fact may have been  as the Cephallenians say, that the wife of Ulysses was of a Cephallenian  family, and that her father's name was Icadius, not Icarius. So that it  is probably a mistake of the critics that has given rise to the Problem.    Speaking generally, one has to justify (1) the Impossible by reference  to the requirements of poetry, or to the better, or to opinion. For  the purposes of poetry a convincing impossibility is preferable to  an unconvincing possibility; and if men such as Zeuxis depicted be  impossible, the answer is that it is better they should be like that, as  the artist ought to improve on his model. (2) The Improbable one has  to justify either by showing it to be in accordance with opinion, or by  urging that at times it is not improbable; for there is a probability of  things happening also against probability. (3) The contradictions found  in the poet's language one should first test as one does an opponent's  confutation in a dialectical argument, so as to see whether he means  the same thing, in the same relation, and in the same sense, before  admitting that he has contradicted either something he has said himself  or what a man of sound sense assumes as true. But there is no possible  apology for improbability of Plot or depravity of character, when they  are not necessary and no use is made of them, like the improbability  in the appearance of Aegeus in _Medea_ and the baseness of Menelaus in  _Orestes_.    The objections, then, of critics start with faults of five kinds:  the allegation is always that something in either (1) impossible, (2)  improbable, (3) corrupting, (4) contradictory, or (5) against technical  correctness. The answers to these objections must be sought under one or  other of the above-mentioned heads, which are twelve in number.          26      The question may be raised whether the epic or the tragic is the higher  form of imitation. It may be argued that, if the less vulgar is the  higher, and the less vulgar is always that which addresses the better  public, an art addressing any and every one is of a very vulgar order.  It is a belief that their public cannot see the meaning, unless they  add something themselves, that causes the perpetual movements of  the performers--bad flute-players, for instance, rolling about, if  quoit-throwing is to be represented, and pulling at the conductor, if  Scylla is the subject of the piece. Tragedy, then, is said to be an art  of this order--to be in fact just what the later actors were in the eyes  of their predecessors; for Myrmiscus used to call Callippides 'the ape',  because he thought he so overacted his parts; and a similar view was  taken of Pindarus also. All Tragedy, however, is said to stand to the  Epic as the newer to the older school of actors. The one, accordingly,  is said to address a cultivated 'audience, which does not need the  accompaniment of gesture; the other, an uncultivated one. If, therefore,  Tragedy is a vulgar art, it must clearly be lower than the Epic.    The answer to this is twofold. In the first place, one may urge (1) that  the censure does not touch the art of the dramatic poet, but only that  of his interpreter; for it is quite possible to overdo the gesturing  even in an epic recital, as did Sosistratus, and in a singing contest,  as did Mnasitheus of Opus. (2) That one should not condemn all movement,  unless one means to condemn even the dance, but only that of ignoble  people--which is the point of the criticism passed on Callippides and  in the present day on others, that their women are not like gentlewomen.  (3) That Tragedy may produce its effect even without movement or action  in just the same way as Epic poetry; for from the mere reading of a  play its quality may be seen. So that, if it be superior in all other  respects, this element of inferiority is not a necessary part of it.    In the second place, one must remember (1) that Tragedy has everything  that the Epic has (even the epic metre being admissible), together with  a not inconsiderable addition in the shape of the Music (a very real  factor in the pleasure of the drama) and the Spectacle. (2) That its  reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the  play as acted. (3) That the tragic imitation requires less space for  the attainment of its end; which is a great advantage, since the more  concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture  of time to dilute it--consider the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles, for instance,  and the effect of expanding it into the number of lines of the _Iliad_.  (4) That there is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets, as  is proved by the fact that any one work of theirs supplies matter for  several tragedies; the result being that, if they take what is really  a single story, it seems curt when briefly told, and thin and waterish  when on the scale of length usual with their verse. In saying that  there is less unity in an epic, I mean an epic made up of a plurality  of actions, in the same way as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ have many such  parts, each one of them in itself of some magnitude; yet the structure  of the two Homeric poems is as perfect as can be, and the action in them  is as nearly as possible one action. If, then, Tragedy is superior in  these respects, and also besides these, in its poetic effect (since the  two forms of poetry should give us, not any or every pleasure, but the  very special kind we have mentioned), it is clear that, as attaining the  poetic effect better than the Epic, it will be the higher form of art.    So much for Tragedy and Epic poetry--for these two arts in general and  their species; the number and nature of their constituent parts; the  causes of success and failure in them; the Objections of the critics,  and the Solutions in answer to them."]]]
