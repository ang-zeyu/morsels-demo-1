This pithy motto he delivered, shaking his head, and giving each  guttural the true Anglo-Saxon enunciation, which is now forgotten in the  southern parts of this realm.    The collection was indeed a curious one, and might well be envied by  an amateur. Yet it was not collected at the enormous prices of modern  times, which are sufficient to have appalled the most determined as well  as earliest bibliomaniac upon record, whom we take to have been none  else than the renowned Don Quixote de la Mancha, as, among other slight  indications of an infirm understanding, he is stated, by his veracious  historian, Cid Hamet Benengeli, to have exchanged fields and farms for  folios and quartos of chivalry. In this species of exploit, the good  knight-errant has been imitated by lords, knights, and squires of our  own day, though we have not yet heard of any that has mistaken an inn  for a castle, or laid his lance in rest against a windmill. Mr. Oldbuck  did not follow these collectors in such excess of expenditure; but,  taking a pleasure in the personal labour of forming his library, saved  his purse at the expense of his time and toil, He was no encourager of  that ingenious race of peripatetic middle-men, who, trafficking between  the obscure keeper of a stall and the eager amateur, make their profit  at once of the ignorance of the former, and the dear-bought skill and  taste of the latter. When such were mentioned in his hearing, he seldom  failed to point out how necessary it was to arrest the object of your  curiosity in its first transit, and to tell his favourite story of  Snuffy Davie and Caxton's Game at Chess.--\"Davy Wilson,\" he said,  \"commonly called Snuffy Davy, from his inveterate addiction to black  rappee, was the very prince of scouts for searching blind alleys,  cellars, and stalls for rare volumes. He had the scent of a slow-hound,  sir, and the snap of a bull-dog. He would detect you an old black-letter  ballad among the leaves of a law-paper, and find an editio princeps  under the mask of a school Corderius. Snuffy Davy bought the Game of  Chess, 1474, the first book ever printed in England, from a stall in  Holland, for about two groschen, or twopence of our money. He sold it  to Osborne for twenty pounds, and as many books as came to twenty pounds  more. Osborne resold this inimitable windfall to Dr. Askew for sixty  guineas. At Dr. Askew's sale,\" continued the old gentleman, kindling as  he spoke, \"this inestimable treasure blazed forth in its full value,  and was purchased by Royalty itself for one hundred and seventy  pounds!--Could a copy now occur, Lord only knows,\" he ejaculated, with a  deep sigh and lifted-up hands--\"Lord only knows what would be its ransom;  and yet it was originally secured, by skill and research, for the  easy equivalent of two-pence sterling. * Happy, thrice happy, Snuffy  Davie!--and blessed were the times when thy industry could be so  rewarded!    * This bibliomaniacal anecdote is literally true; and David Wilson, the  author need not tell his brethren of the Roxburghe and Bannatyne Clubs,  was a real personage.    \"Even I, sir,\" he went on, \"though far inferior in industry and  discernment and presence of mind, to that great man, can show you a  few--a very few things, which I have collected, not by force of money,  as any wealthy man might,--although, as my friend Lucian says, he might  chance to throw away his coin only to illustrate his ignorance,--but  gained in a manner that shows I know something of the matter. See this  bundle of ballads, not one of them later than 1700, and some of them  an hundred years older. I wheedled an old woman out of these, who loved  them better than her psalm-book. Tobacco, sir, snuff, and the Complete  Syren, were the equivalent! For that, mutilated copy of the Complaynt of  Scotland, I sat out the drinking of two dozen bottles of strong ale with  the late learned proprietor, who, in gratitude, bequeathed it to me by  his last will. These little Elzevirs are the memoranda and trophies of  many a walk by night and morning through the Cowgate, the Canongate, the  Bow, St. Mary's Wynd,--wherever, in fine, there were to be found brokers  and trokers, those miscellaneous dealers in things rare and curious.  How often have I stood haggling on a halfpenny, lest, by a too ready  acquiescence in the dealer's first price, he should be led to suspect  the value I set upon the article!--how have I trembled, lest some passing  stranger should chop in between me and the prize, and regarded each poor  student of divinity that stopped to turn over the books at the stall,  as a rival amateur, or prowling bookseller in disguise!--And then, Mr.  Lovel, the sly satisfaction with which one pays the consideration, and  pockets the article, affecting a cold indifference, while the hand is  trembling with pleasure!--Then to dazzle the eyes of our wealthier and  emulous rivals by showing them such a treasure as this\" (displaying a  little black smoked book about the size of a primer); \"to enjoy their  surprise and envy, shrouding meanwhile, under a veil of mysterious  consciousness, our own superior knowledge and dexterity these, my young  friend, these are the white moments of life, that repay the toil, and  pains, and sedulous attention, which our profession, above all others,  so peculiarly demands!\"    Lovel was not a little amused at hearing the old gentleman run on in  this manner, and, however incapable of entering into the full merits  of what he beheld, he admired, as much as could have been expected, the  various treasures which Oldbuck exhibited. Here were editions esteemed  as being the first, and there stood those scarcely less regarded as  being the last and best; here was a book valued because it had the  author's final improvements, and there another which (strange to tell!)  was in request because it had them not. One was precious because it  was a folio, another because it was a duodecimo; some because they  were tall, some because they were short; the merit of this lay in the  title-page--of that in the arrangement of the letters in the word Finis.  There was, it seemed, no peculiar distinction, however trifling  or minute, which might not give value to a volume, providing the  indispensable quality of scarcity, or rare occurrence, was attached to  it.    Not the least fascinating was the original broadside,--the Dying Speech,  Bloody Murder, or Wonderful Wonder of Wonders,--in its primary tattered  guise, as it was hawked through the streets, and sold for the cheap and  easy price of one penny, though now worth the weight of that penny in  gold. On these the Antiquary dilated with transport, and read, with a  rapturous voice, the elaborate titles, which bore the same proportion to  the contents that the painted signs without a showman's booth do to the  animals within. Mr. Oldbuck, for example, piqued himself especially  in possessing an unique broadside, entitled and called \"Strange and  Wonderful News from Chipping-Norton, in the County of Oxon, of certain  dreadful Apparitions which were seen in the Air on the 26th of July  1610, at Half an Hour after Nine o'Clock at Noon, and continued till  Eleven, in which Time was seen Appearances of several flaming Swords,  strange Motions of the superior Orbs; with the unusual Sparkling of  the Stars, with their dreadful Continuations; With the Account of the  Opening of the Heavens, and strange Appearances therein disclosing  themselves, with several other prodigious Circumstances not heard of in  any Age, to the great Amazement of the Beholders, as it was communicated  in a Letter to one Mr. Colley, living in West Smithfield, and attested  by Thomas Brown, Elizabeth Greenaway, and Anne Gutheridge, who were  Spectators of the dreadful Apparitions: And if any one would be  further satisfied of the Truth of this Relation, let them repair to  Mr. Nightingale's at the Bear Inn, in West Smithfield, and they may be  satisfied.\"*    * Of this thrice and four times rare broadside, the author possesses an  exemplar.    \"You laugh at this,\" said the proprietor of the collection, \"and I  forgive you. I do acknowledge that the charms on which we doat are not  so obvious to the eyes of youth as those of a fair lady; but you will  grow wiser, and see more justly, when you come to wear spectacles.--Yet  stay, I have one piece of antiquity, which you, perhaps, will prize more  highly.\"    So saying, Mr. Oldbuck unlocked a drawer, and took out a bundle of keys,  then pulled aside a piece of the tapestry which concealed the door of  a small closet, into which he descended by four stone steps, and,  after some tinkling among bottles and cans, produced two long-stalked  wine-glasses with bell mouths, such as are seen in Teniers' pieces, and  a small bottle of what he called rich racy canary, with a little bit  of diet cake, on a small silver server of exquisite old workmanship. \"I  will say nothing of the server,\" he remarked, \"though it is said to  have been wrought by the old mad Florentine, Benvenuto Cellini. But, Mr.  Lovel, our ancestors drank sack--you, who admire the drama, know where  that's to be found.--Here's success to your exertions at Fairport, sir!\"    \"And to you, sir, and an ample increase to your treasure, with no more  trouble on your part than is just necessary to make the acquisitions  valuable.\"    After a libation so suitable to the amusement in which they had been  engaged, Lovel rose to take his leave, and Mr. Oldbuck prepared to give  him his company a part of the way, and show him something worthy of his  curiosity on his return "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7010"],[0,"Graded Lessons in English (#11)"],[1,"old man has been a _soldier_.

The _sun_ warms the _earth_.    The _sun_ is a luminous _body_.    Moon, oak, fire, whiskey.          LESSON 48.    SUBJECT OR COMPLEMENT MODIFIED BY A PARTICIPLE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--You have learned, in the preceding Lessons,  that a _quality_ may be _assumed_ as belonging to a thing; as, _white  chalk_, or that it may be _asserted_ of it; as, _Chalk is white_. An  _action_, also, may be _assumed_ as belonging to something; as, _Peter  turning_, or it may be _asserted;_ as, Peter _turned_. In the expression,  _Peter, turning, said_, what word expresses an action as _assumed_, and  which _asserts_ an action? Each pupil may give an example of an action  asserted and of an action assumed; as, Corn _grows_, corn _growing_; geese  _gabble_; geese _gabbling_.    This form of the verb, which merely _assumes_ the act, being, or state, is  called the +Participle+.    When the words _growing_ and _gabbling_ are placed before the nouns, thus:  _growing corn, gabbling geese_, they tell simply the kind of corn and the  kind of geese, and are therefore _adjectives_.    When _the_ or some other adjective is placed before these words, and a  preposition after them, thus: _The growing of the corn, the gabbling of the  geese_, they are simply the _names_ of actions, and are therefore _nouns_.    Let each pupil give an example of a verb asserting an action, and change it  to express:--    1st, An _assumed_ action; 2d, A permanent _quality;_ 3d, The _name_ of an  action.      _Participles_ may be completed by _objects_ and _attributes_.    +Analysis and Parsing+.    +Model+.--_Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again_.      Truth    |  will rise   ==========|=============    \\cru     |    \\again     \\  shed      --------        \\to         \\  earth          \\-------    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--In this diagram, the line standing for the  principal word of the participial phrase is broken; one part slants, and  the other is horizontal. This shows that the participle _crushed_ is used  like an adjective to modify _Truth_, and yet retains the nature of a verb,  expressing an action received by truth.    +Oral Analysis+.--This is a sentence, because ----; _Truth_ is the subject,  because ----; _will rise_ is the predicate, because ----; the phrase,  _crushed to earth_, is a modifier of the Subj., because ----; _crushed_  introduces the phrase and is the principal word in it; the phrase _to  earth_ is a modifier of _crushed_; _to_ introduces it, and _earth_ is the  principal word in it; _again_ is a modifier of the Pred., because ----.  _Truth crushed to earth_ is the modified subject, _will rise again_ is the  modified predicate.    +Parsing+--_Crushed_ is the form of the verb called _participle_. The  action expressed by it is merely _assumed_.    1. The mirth of Addison is genial, imparting a mild glow of thought.  2. The general, riding to the front, led the attack.  3. The balloon, shooting swiftly into the clouds, was soon lost to sight.  4. Wealth acquired dishonestly will prove a curse.  5. The sun, rising, dispelled the mists.  6. The thief, being detected, surrendered to the officer.  7. They boarded the vessel lying in the harbor.  8. The territory claimed by the Dutch was called New Netherlands.  9. Washington, having crossed the Delaware, attacked the Hessians stationed     at Trenton.  10. Burgoyne, having been surrounded at Saratoga, surrendered to Gen.      Gates.  11. Pocahontas was married to a young Englishman named John Rolfe.  12. A shrug of the shoulders, translated into words, loses much force.  13. The armies of England, mustered for the battles of Europe, do not      awaken sincere admiration.    (Note that the participle, like the predicate verb, may consist of two or  more words.)    (Note, too, that the participle, like the adjective, may belong to a  _noun complement_.)          LESSON 49.    THE INFINITIVE PHRASE.    +Hints for Oral Instruction+.--There is another form of the verb which,  like the participle, cannot be the predicate of a sentence, for it cannot  _assert_; as, She went out _to see_ a friend; _To lie_ is a disgrace. As  this form of the verb expresses the action, being, or state in a general  manner, without limiting it directly to a subject, it is called an  +Infinitive+, which means _without limit_. The infinitive generally follows  _to_; as, _to walk, to sleep_.    Let each pupil give an infinitive.    The infinitive and the preposition _to_ constitute a phrase, which may be  employed in several ways.    +T+.--_I have a duty to perform_. The infinitive phrase modifies what?    +P+.--The noun _duty_. +T+.--It then performs the office of what? +P+.--Of  an adjective modifier.    +T+.--_I come to hear_. The infinitive phrase modifies what? +P+.--The verb  _come_. +T+.--What office then does it perform? +P+.--Of an adverb  modifier.    +T+.--_To lie is base_. _What_ is base? +P+.--To lie. +T+.--_He attempted  to speak_. _What_ did he attempt? +P+.--To speak. +T+.--_To lie_ is a  subject, and _to speak_ is an _object_. What part of speech is used as  subject and object? +P+.--The noun.    +T+.--The +Infinitive+ phrase is used as an +adjective+, an +adverb+, and a  +noun+.    _Infinitives_ may be completed by _objects_ and _attributes_.    +Analysis and Parsing+.    +Model+.--_David hasted to meet Goliath_.      David   |  hasted  ==========|===========            |    \\to                  \\  meet | Goliath                   \\----------------    +Analysis of the Infinitive Phrase+.--_To_ introduces the phrase; _meet_,  completed by the object _Goliath_, is the principal part.    +Parsing of the Phrase+.--_To_ is a preposition, because ----; _meet_ is a  verb, because ----; _Goliath_ is a noun, because ----.    1. I come not here to talk.  2. I rejoice to hear it.  3. A desire to excel leads to eminence.  4. Dr. Franklin was sent to France to solicit aid for the colonies.  5. To retreat was impossible.    (_To_ is here used merely to introduce the infinitive phrase.)     \\to    \\  retreat     \\---------         |         |        / \\   |  was  \\  impossible    ==========|======================              |    +Explanation of the Diagram+.--As this _phrase subject_ cannot, in its  proper form, be written on the subject line, it is placed above, and, by  means of a support, the phrase diagram is made to rest on the subject line.  The _phrase complement_ may be diagramed in a similar way, and made to rest  on the complement line.    6. The hands refuse to labor.  7. To live is not all of life.  8. The Puritans desired to obtain religious freedom.  9. The Romans, having conquered the world, were unable to conquer     themselves.  10. Narvaez sailed from Cuba to conquer Florida.  11. Some savages of America and Africa love to wear rings in the nose.  12. Andrew Jackson, elected to succeed J. Q. Adams, was inaugurated in      1829.          LESSON 50.    POSITION AND PUNCTUATION OF THE PARTICIPIAL PHRASE.    ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED. (See Caution 1, Lesson 41.)    Punctuate as you correct. (See Lesson 37.)      A house was built for a clergyman having seven gables.    The old man struck the saucy boy raising a gold-headed cane.    We saw a marble bust of Sir W. Scott entering the vestibule.    Here is news from a neighbor boiled down.    I found a cent walking over the bridge.    Balboa discovered the Pacific ocean climbing to the top of a mountain.

Give the caution relating to the position of the phrase modifier; that  relating to the choice of prepositions; that relating to the double  negative (Lesson 41). Give examples of errors. Can a noun be an attribute  complement? Illustrate. What do you understand by a participle? Into what  may some participles be changed? Illustrate. What offices does the  infinitive phrase perform? Illustrate them.    +To the Teacher+.--See COMPOSITION EXERCISES in the Supplement--Selection  from George Eliot.          LESSON 51.    REVIEW.    MISCELLANEOUS ERRORS FOR CORRECTION.
