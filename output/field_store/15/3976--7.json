The worst of it is, no doubt she  has got some big guns on board, and these little things of ours are  of no good except at close quarters. It would be no use trying to  make a running fight with her?\"    \"Not in the least, Peters. We had better sail straight at her.\"    \"You don't mean to try and carry her by boarding?\" Peters asked  doubtfully. \"She looks a large ship, and has perhaps a hundred and  fifty men on board; and though the Spaniards are no sailors they  can fight on the decks of their ships.\"    \"That is so, Peters. What I think of doing is to bear straight  down upon her as if I intended to board. We shall have to stand one  broadside as we come up, and then we shall be past her, and with  our light draught we should run right away from her with this wind.  There is more of it than there was, and we are slipping away fast.  Unless she happens to knock away one of our masts we shall get away  from her.\"    When they were within half a mile of the Spanish ship they saw her  bows bear off.    \"Lie down, lads,\" the captain ordered, \"she is going to give us a  broadside. When it is over start one of those sea beggar songs you  picked up at Brill; that will startle them, and they will think we  are crowded with men and going to board them.\"    A minute later eight flashes of fire burst from the Spanish ship,  now lying broadside to them. One shot crashed through the bulwarks,  two others passed through the sails, the rest went wide of their  mark. As soon as it was over the crew leapt to their feet and burst  into one of the wild songs sung by the sea beggars.    \"Keep our head straight towards her, Peters,\" Captain Martin said.  \"They will think we mean to run her down, and it will flurry and  confuse them.\"    Loading was not quick work in those days, and the distance between  the vessels was decreased by half before the guns were again fired.  This time it was not a broadside; the guns went off one by one as  they were loaded, and the aim was hasty and inaccurate, for close  as they were not a shot struck the hull of the Good Venture, though  two or three went through the sails. In the bright moonlight men  could be seen running about and officers waving their arms and giving  orders on board the Spaniard, and then her head began to pay off.    \"We have scared them,\" Captain Martin laughed. \"They thought we were  going to run them down. They know the sea beggars would be quite  content to sink themselves if they could sink an enemy. Follow  close in her wake, Peters, and then bear off a little as if you  meant to pass them on their starboard side; then when you get close  give her the helm sharp and sweep across her stern. We will give  her the guns as we pass, then bear off again and pass her on her  port side; the chances are they will not have loaded again there.\"    The Spanish ship was little more than a hundred yards ahead. When  she got before the wind again Captain Martin saw with satisfaction  that the Good Venture sailed three feet to her two. The poop and  stern galleries of the Spaniard were clustered with soldiers, who  opened a fire with their muskets upon their pursuer. The men were  all lying down now at their guns, which were loaded with musket  balls to their muzzles.    \"Elevate them as much as you can. She is much higher out of the  water than we are. Now, Peters, you see to the guns, I will take  the helm.\"    \"I will keep the helm, sir,\" the mate replied.    \"No, you won't, Peters; my place is the place of danger. But if  you like you can lie under the bulwark there after you have fired,  and be ready to take my place if you see me drop. Now, lads, get  ready.\"    So saying the captain put down the tiller. The Good Venture swept  round under the stern of the Spaniard at a distance of some forty  yards, and as she did so the guns loaded with bullets to the  muzzle were fired one after the other. The effect was terrible,  and the galleries and poop were swept by the leaden shower. Then  the captain straightened the helm again. The crew burst into the  wild yells and cries the beggars raised when going into battle. The  Spaniards, confused by the terrible slaughter worked by the guns  of their enemies, and believing that they were about to be boarded  on the port side by a crowd of desperate foemen, hastily put up  the tiller, and the ship bore away as the Good Venture swept up,  presenting her stern instead of her broadside to them.    To the momentary relief of the Spaniards their assailant instead  of imitating their maneuvers kept straight upon her course before  the wind, and instead of the wild cries of the beggars a hearty  English cheer was raised. As Captain Martin had expected, the guns  on the port side had not been reloaded after the last discharge,  and the Good Venture was two or three hundred yards away before  the Spaniards recovered from their surprise at what seemed the  incomprehensible maneuver of their foes, and awoke to the fact  that they had been tricked, and that instead of a ship crowded with  beggars of the sea their supposed assailant had been an English  trader that was trying to escape from them.    A dozen contradictory orders were shouted as soon as the truth  dawned upon them. The captain had been killed by the discharge of  grape, and the first lieutenant severely wounded. The officer in  command of the troops shouted to his men to load the guns, only to  find when this was accomplished that the second lieutenant of the  ship had turned her head in pursuit of the enemy, and that not a  single gun would bear. There was a sharp altercation between the  two authorities, but the military chief was of the highest rank.    \"Don't you see,\" he said furiously, \"that she is going away from  us every foot. She was but a couple of hundred yards away when I  gave the order to load, and now she is fully a quarter of a mile.\"    \"If I put the helm down to bring her broadside on,\" the seaman  said, \"she will be half a mile ahead before we can straighten up  and get in her wake again; and unless you happen to cripple her  she will get away to a certainty.\"    \"She will get away anyhow,\" the soldier roared, \"if we don't cripple  her. Put your helm down instantly.\"    The order was given and the ship's head swayed round. There was a  flapping of sails and a rattling of blocks, and then a broadside  was fired; but it is no easy matter for angry and excited men to  hit a mast at the distance of nearly half a mile. One of the shots  ploughed up the deck within a yard of the foot of the mainmast,  another splintered a boat, three others added to the holes in the  sails, but no damage of importance was done. By the time the Spaniard  had borne round and was again in chase, the Good Venture was over  half a mile ahead.    \"It is all over now, captain,\" Peters said as he went aft. \"Unless  we light upon another of these fellows, which is not likely, we  are safe.\"    \"Are any of the men hit, Peters?\"    \"The carpenter was knocked down and stunned by a splinter from the  boat, sir; but I don't think it is serious.\"    \"Thank God for that,\" the captain said. \"Now, will you take the  helm?\" There was something in the voice that startled the mate.    \"Is anything the matter, sir? Don't say you are hit.\"    \"I am hit, Peters, and I fear rather badly; but that matters little  now that the crew and ship are safe.\"    Peters caught the captain, for he saw that he could scarce stand,  and called two men to his assistance. The captain was laid down on  the deck.    \"Where are you hit, sir?\"    \"Halfway between the knee and the hip,\" Captain Martin replied  faintly. \"If it hadn't been for the tiller I should have fallen,  but with the aid of that I made shift to stand on the other leg. It  was just before we fired, at the moment when I put the helm down.\"    \"Why didn't you call me?\" Peters said reproachfully.    \"It was of no good getting two of us hit, Peters; and as long as  I could stand to steer I was better there than you.\"    Ned came running aft as the news was passed along that the captain  was wounded, and threw himself on his knees by his father's side.    \"Bear up, Ned; bear up like a man,\" his father said. \"I am hit  hard, but I don't know that it is to death. But even if it is, it  is ten thousand times better to die in battle with the Spaniards  than to be hung like a dog, which would have befallen me and perhaps  all of us if they had taken us.\"    By Peters' directions a mattress was now brought up, and the captain  carried down to his cabin. There was no thought on board now of the  pursuers astern, or of possible danger lying ahead. The news that  Captain Martin was badly wounded damped all the feelings of triumph  and enthusiasm which the crew had before been feeling at the success  with which they had eluded the Spaniard while heavily punishing  her. As soon as the captain was laid on a sofa Peters examined the  wound. It was right in front of the leg, some four inches above  the knee.    \"There is nothing to be done for it,\" Captain Martin said. \"It has  smashed the bone, I am sure.\"    \"I am afraid it has, captain,\" Peters said ruefully; \"and it is no  use my saying that it has not. I think, sir, we had best put in at  Enkhuizen. We are not above four or five miles from it now, and we  shall find surgeons there who will do all they can for you.\"    \"I think that will be the best plan, Peters.\"    The orders were given at once, and the ship's course altered, and  half an hour later the lights of Enkhuizen were seen ahead.        CHAPTER IV    WOUNDED      They dropped anchor a short distance off the port, and then lit  some torches and waved them.    \"The firing is sure to have been heard,\" Peters said, \"and they  will be sending off to know what is going on, otherwise there would  have been small chance of getting in tonight.\"    As the mate anticipated, the sound of oars was soon heard, and a  large boat rowed out towards them. It stopped at a distance of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],[0,"The Prince and Betty (#11)"],[1,"foot of the hill, the dome of the Casino caught  the sun, and flashed out in a blaze of gold.    He swung round and faced Mr. Scobell. He had made up his mind.    The financier was still talking.    \"So that's how it stands, Prince,\" he was saying, \"and it's up to us to  get busy.\"    John looked at him.    \"I intend to,\" he said.    \"Good boy!\" said the financier.    \"To begin with, I shall run you out of this place, Mr. Scobell.\"    The other gasped.    \"There is going to be a cleaning-up,\" John went on. \"I've thought it  out. There will be no more gambling in Mervo.\"    \"You're crazy with the heat!\" gasped Mr. Scobell. \"Abolish gambling?  You can't.\"    \"I can. That concession of yours isn't worth the paper it's written on.  The Republic gave it to you. The Republic's finished. If you want to  conduct a Casino in Mervo, there's only one man who can give you  permission, and that's myself. The acts of the Republic are not binding  on me. For a week you have been gambling on this island without a  concession and now it's going to stop. Do you understand?\"    \"But, Prince, talk sense.\" Mr. Scobell's voice was almost tearful.  \"It's you who don't understand. Do, for the love of Mike, come down off  the roof and talk sense. Do you suppose that these guys here will stand  for this? Not on your life. Not for a minute. See here. I'm not blaming  you. I know you don't know what you're saying. But listen here. You  must cut out this kind of thing. You mustn't get these ideas in your  head. You stick to your job, and don't butt in on other folks'. Do you  know how long you'd stay Prince of this joint if you started in to  monkey with my Casino? Just about long enough to let you pack a  collar-stud and a toothbrush into your grip. And after that there  wouldn't be any more Prince, sonnie. You stick to your job and I'll  stick to mine. You're a mighty good Prince for all that's required of  you. You're ornamental, and you've got get-up in you. You just keep  right on being a good boy, and don't start trying stunts off your own  beat, and you'll do fine. Don't forget that I'm the big noise here. I'm  old Grayback from 'way back in Mervo. See! I've only to twiddle my  fingers and there'll be a revolution and you for the Down-and-Out Club.  Don't you forget it, sonnie.\"    John shrugged his shoulders.    \"I've said all I have to say. You've had your notice to quit. After  to-night the Casino is closed.\"    \"But don't I tell you the people won't stand for it?\"    \"That's for them to decide. They may have some self-respect.\"    \"They'll fire you!\"    \"Very well. That will prove that they have not.\"    \"Prince, talk sense! You can't mean that you'll throw away a hundred  thousand dollars a year as if it was dirt!\"    \"It is dirt when it's made that way. We needn't discuss it any more.\"    \"But, Prince!\"    \"It's finished.\"    \"But, say--!\"    John had left the room.    He had been gone several minutes before the financier recovered full  possession of his faculties.    When he did, his remarks were brief and to the point.    \"Bug-house!\" he gasped. \"Abso-lutely bug-house!\"          CHAPTER IX    MERVO CHANGES ITS CONSTITUTION      Humor, if one looks into it, is principally a matter of retrospect. In  after years John was wont to look back with amusement on the revolution  which ejected him from the throne of his ancestors. But at the time its  mirthfulness did not appeal to him. He was in a frenzy of restlessness.  He wanted Betty. He wanted to see her and explain. Explanations could  not restore him to the place he had held in her mind, but at least they  would show her that he was not the thing he had appeared.    Mervo had become a prison. He ached for America. But, before he could  go, this matter of the Casino must be settled. It was obvious that it  could only be settled in one way. He did not credit his subjects with  the high-mindedness that puts ideals first and money after. That  military and civilians alike would rally to a man round Mr. Scobell and  the Casino he was well aware. But this did not affect his determination  to remain till the last. If he went now, he would be like a boy who  makes a runaway ring at the doorbell. Until he should receive formal  notice of dismissal, he must stay, although every day had forty-eight  hours and every hour twice its complement of weary minutes.    So he waited, chafing, while Mervo examined the situation, turned it  over in its mind, discussed it, slept upon it, discussed it again, and  displayed generally that ponderous leisureliness which is the Mervian's  birthright.    Indeed, the earliest demonstration was not Mervian at all. It came from  the visitors to the island, and consisted of a deputation of four,  headed by the wizened little man, who had frowned at John in the Dutch  room on the occasion of his meeting with Betty, and a stolid individual  with a bald forehead and a walrus mustache.    The tone of the deputation was, from the first, querulous. The wizened  man had constituted himself spokesman. He introduced the party--the  walrus as Colonel Finch, the others as Herr von Mandelbaum and Mr.  Archer-Cleeve. His own name was Pugh, and the whole party, like the  other visitors whom they represented, had, it seemed, come to Mervo, at  great trouble and expense, to patronize the tables, only to find these  suddenly, without a word of warning, withdrawn from their patronage.  And what the deputation wished to know was, What did it all mean?    \"We were amazed, sir--Your Highness,\" said Mr. Pugh. \"We could not--we  cannot--understand it. The entire thing is a baffling mystery to us. We  asked the soldiers at the door. They referred us to Mr. Scobell. We  asked Mr. Scobell. He referred us to you. And now we have come, as the  representatives of our fellow visitors to this island, to ask Your  Highness what it means!\"    \"Have a cigar,\" said John, extending the box. Mr. Pugh waved aside the  preferred gift impatiently. Not so Herr von Mandelbaum, who slid  forward after the manner of one in quest of second base and retired  with his prize to the rear of the little army once more.    Mr. Archer-Cleeve, a young man with carefully parted fair hair and the  expression of a strayed sheep, contributed a remark.    \"No, but I say, by Jove, you know, I mean really, you know, what?\"    That was Mr. Archer-Cleeve upon the situation.    \"We have not come here for cigars,\" said Mr. Pugh. \"We have come here,  Your Highness, for an explanation.\"    \"Of what?\" said John.    Mr. Pugh made an impatient gesture.    \"Do you question my right to rule this massive country as I think best,  Mr. Pugh?\"    \"It is a high-handed proceeding,\" said the wizened little man.    The walrus spoke for the first time.    \"What say?\" he murmured huskily.    \"I said,\" repeated Mr. Pugh, raising his voice, \"that it was a  high-handed proceeding, Colonel.\"    The walrus nodded heavily, in assent, with closed eyes.    \"Yah,\" said Herr von Mandelbaum through the smoke.    John looked at the spokesman.    \"You are from England, Mr. Pugh?\"    \"Yes, sir. I am a British citizen.\"    \"Suppose some enterprising person began to run a gambling hell in  Piccadilly, would the authorities look on and smile?\"    \"That is an entirely different matter, sir. You are quibbling. In  England gambling is forbidden by law.\"    \"So it is in Mervo, Mr. Pugh.\"    \"Tchah!\"    \"What say?\" said the walrus.    \"I said 'Tchah!' Colonel.\"    \"Why?\" said the walrus.    \"Because His Highness quibbled.\"    The walrus nodded approvingly.    \"His Highness did nothing of the sort,\" said John. \"Gambling is  forbidden in Mervo for the same reason that it is forbidden in England,  because it demoralizes the people.\"    \"This is absurd, sir. Gambling has been permitted in Mervo for nearly a  year.\"    \"But not by me, Mr. Pugh. The Republic certainly granted Mr. Scobell a  concession. But, when I came to the throne, it became necessary for him  to get a concession from me. I refused it. Hence the closed doors.\"    Mr. Archer-Cleeve once more. \"But--\" He paused. \"Forgotten what I was  going to say,\" he said to the room at large.    Herr von Mandelbaum made some remark at the back of his throat, but was  ignored.    John spoke again.    \"If you were a prince, Mr. Pugh, would you find it pleasant to be in  the pay of a gambling hell?\"    \"That is neither here nor--\"    \"On the contrary, it is, very much. I happen to have some self-respect.  I've only just found it out, it's true, but it's there all right. I  don't want to be a prince--take it from me, it's a much overrated  profession--but if I've got to be one, I'll specialize. I won't combine  it with being a bunco steerer on the side. As long as I am on the  throne, this high-toned crap-shooting will continue a back number.\"    \"What say?\" said the walrus.    \"I said that, while I am on the throne here, people who feel it  necessary to chant 'Come, little seven!' must do it elsewhere.\"    \"I don't understand you,\" said Mr. Pugh. \"Your remarks are absolutely  unintelligible.\"    \"Never mind. My actions speak for themselves. It doesn't matter how I  describe it--what it comes to is that the Casino is closed. You can  follow that? Mervo is no longer running wide open. The lid is on.\"    \"Then let me tell you, sir--\" Mr. Pugh brought a bony fist down with a  thump on the table--\"that you are playing with fire. Understand me,  sir, we are not here to threaten. We are a peaceful deputation of  visitors. But I have observed your people, sir. I have watched them  narrowly. And let me tell you that you are walking on a volcano.  Already there are signs of grave discontent.\"    \"Already!\" cried John. \"Already's good. I guess they call it going some  in this infernal country if they can keep awake long enough to take  action within a year after a thing has happened. I don't know if you  have any influence with the populace, Mr. Pugh--you seem a pretty warm  and important sort of person--but, if you have,"]]]
