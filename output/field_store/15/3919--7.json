We therefore wished to learn whether circumnutation could be  observed in the hypocotyl if carefully observed in our usual manner. Two  seedlings were kept in the dark with filaments fixed to the upper part of  their hypocotyls; but from circumstances not worth explaining their  movements were traced for only a short time. One moved thrice forwards and  twice backwards in nearly opposite directions, in the course of 3 h. 15 m.;  and the other twice forwards and twice backwards in 2 h. 22 m. The  hypocotyl therefore circumnutated at a remarkably rapid rate. It may here  be added that a filament was affixed transversely to the summit of the  second internode above the cotyledons of a little plant 3 ½ inches in  height; and its movements were traced on a horizontal glass. It  circumnutated, and the actual distance travelled from side to side was a  quarter of an inch, which was too small an amount to be perceived without  the aid of marks.    The movements of the cotyledons are interesting from their complexity and  rapidity, and in some other respects. The hypocotyl (2 inches high) of a  vigorous seedling was secured to a stick, and a filament with triangles of  paper was affixed to one of the cotyledons. The plant was kept all day in  the hot-house, and at 4.20 P.M. (June 20th) was placed under a skylight in  the house, and observed occasionally during the evening and night. It fell  in a slightly zigzag line to a moderate extent from 4.20 P.M. till 10.15  P.M. When looked at shortly after midnight (12.30 P.M.) it had risen a very  little, and considerably by    * 'Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants,' p. 33, 1875.  [page 48]    3.45 A.M. When again looked at, at 6.10 A.M. (21st), it had fallen largely.  A new tracing was now begun (see Fig. 35), and soon afterwards, at 6.42  A.M., the cotyledon had risen a little. During the forenoon it was observed  about every hour; but between 12.30 and 6 P.M. every half-hour. If the  observations had been made at these short intervals during the whole day,  the figure would have been too intricate to have been copied. As it was,  the cotyledon moved up and down in the course of 16 h. 20 m. (i.e. between  6.10 A.M. and 10.30 P.M.) thirteen times.    Fig 35. Ipomoea caerulea: circumnutation of cotyledon, traced on vertical  glass, from 6.10 A.M. June 21st to 6.45 A.M. 22nd. Cotyledon with petiole  1.6 inch in length, apex of blade 4.1 inch from the vertical glass; so  movement not greatly magnified; temp. 20o C.    The cotyledons of this seedling sank downwards during both evenings and the  early part of the night, but rose during the latter part. As this is an  unusual movement, the cotyledons of twelve other seedlings were observed;  they stood almost or quite horizontally at mid-day, and at 10 P.M. were all  declined at various angles. The most usual angle was between 30o and 35o;  but three stood at about 50o and one at even 70o beneath the horizon. The  blades of all these cotyledons had attained almost their full size, viz.  from 1 to 1 ½ inches in length, measured along their midribs. It is a  remarkable fact that whilst young--that is, when less than half an inch in  length, measured in the same manner--they do not sink  [page 49]  downwards in the evening. Therefore their weight, which is considerable  when almost fully developed, probably came into play in originally  determining the downward movement. The periodicity of this movement is much  influenced by the degree of light to which the seedlings have been exposed  during the day; for three kept in an obscure place began to sink about  noon, instead of late in the evening; and those of another seedling were  almost paralysed by having been similarly kept during two whole days. The  cotyledons of several other species of Ipomoea likewise sink downwards late  in the evening.    Cerinthe major (Boragineae).--The circumnutation of the hypocotyl of a  young seedling with the cotyledons hardly    Fig. 36. Cerinthe major: circumnutation of hypocotyl, with filament fixed  across its summit, illuminated from above, traced on horizontal glass, from  9.26 A.M. to 9.53 P.M. on Oct. 25th. Movement of the bead magnified 30  times, here reduced to one-third of original scale.    expanded, is shown in the annexed figure (Fig. 36), which apparently  represents four or five irregular ellipses, described in the course of a  little over 12 hours. Two older seedlings were similarly observed,  excepting that one of them was kept in the dark; their hypocotyls also  circumnutated, but in a more simple manner. The cotyledons on a seedling  exposed to the light fell from the early morning until a little after noon,  and then continued to rise until 10.30 P.M. or later. The cotyledons of  this same seedling acted in the same general manner during the two  following days. It had previously been tried in the dark, and after being  thus kept for only 1 h. 40 m. the cotyledons began at 4.30 P.M. to sink,  instead of continuing to rise till late at night.  [page 50]    Nolana prostrata (Nolaneae).--The movements were not traced, but a pot with  seedlings, which had been kept in the dark for an hour, was placed under  the microscope, with the micrometer eye-piece so adjusted that each  division equalled 1/500th of an inch. The apex of one of the cotyledons  crossed rather obliquely four divisions in 13 minutes; it was also sinking,  as shown by getting out of focus. The seedlings were again placed in  darkness for another hour, and the apex now crossed two divisions in 6 m.  18 s.; that is, at very nearly the same rate as before. After another  interval of an hour in darkness, it crossed two divisions in 4 m. 15 s.,  therefore at a quicker rate. In the afternoon, after a longer interval in  the dark, the apex was motionless, but after a time it recommenced moving,  though slowly; perhaps the room was too cold. Judging from previous cases,  there can hardly be a doubt that this seedling was circumnutating.    Fig. 37. Solanum lycopersicum: circumnutation of hypocotyl, with filament  fixed across its summit, traced on horizontal glass, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.  Oct. 24th. Illuminated obliquely from above. Movement of bead magnified  about 35 times, here reduced to one-third of original scale.    Solanum lycopersicum (Solaneae).--The movements of the hypocotyls of two  seedling tomatoes were observed during seven hours, and there could be no  doubt that both circumnutated. They were illuminated from above, but by an  accident a little light entered on one side, and in the accompanying figure  (Fig. 37) it may be seen that the hypocotyl moved to this side (the upper  one in the figure), making small loops and zigzagging in its course. The  movements of the cotyledons were also traced both on vertical and  horizontal glasses; their angles with the horizon were likewise measured at  various hours. They fell from 8.30 A.M. (October 17th) to about noon; then  moved laterally in a zigzag line, and at about 4 P.M. began to rise; they  continued to do so until 10.30 P.M., by which hour they stood vertically  and were asleep. At what hour of the night or early morning they began to  fall was not ascertained. Owing to the lateral movement shortly after  mid-day, the descending and ascending lines did not coincide, and irregular  ellipses were described during each 24 h. The regular periodicity of these  movements is destroyed, as we shall hereafter see, if the seedlings are  kept in the dark.  [page 51]    Solanum palinacanthum.--Several arched hypocotyls rising nearly .2 of an  inch above the ground, but with the cotyledons still buried beneath the  surface, were observed, and the tracings showed that they circumnutated.  Moreover, in several cases little open circular spaces or cracks in the  argillaceous sand which surrounded the arched hypocotyls were visible, and  these appeared to have been made by the hypocotyls having bent first to one  and then to another side whilst growing upwards. In two instances the  vertical arches were observed to move to a considerable distance backwards  from the point where the cotyledons lay buried; this movement, which has  been noticed in some other cases, and which seems to aid in extracting the  cotyledons from the buried seed-coats, is due to the commencement of the  straightening of the hypocotyl. In order to prevent this latter movement,  the two legs of an arch, the    Fig. 38. Solanum palinacanthum: circumnutation of an arched hypocotyl, just  emerging from the ground, with the two legs tied together, traced in  darkness on a horizontal glass, from 9.20 A.M. Dec. 17th to 8.30 A.M. 19th.  Movement of bead magnified 13 times; but the filament, which was affixed  obliquely to the crown of the arch, was of unusual length.    summit of which was on a level with the surface of the soil, were tied  together; the earth having been previously removed to a little depth all  round. The movement of the arch during 47 hours under these unnatural  circumstances is exhibited in the annexed figure.    The cotyledons of some seedlings in the hot-house were horizontal about  noon on December 13th; and at 10 P.M. had risen to an angle of 27o above  the horizon; at 7 A.M. on the following  [page 52]  morning, before it was light, they had risen to 59o above the horizon; in  the afternoon of the same day they were found again horizontal.    Beta vulgaris (Chenopodeae).--The seedlings are excessively sensitive to  light, so that although on the first day they were uncovered only during  two or three minutes at each observation, they all moved steadily towards  the side of the room whence the light proceeded, and the tracings consisted  only of slightly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5625"],[0,"Flint and Feather: Collected Verse (#11)"],[1,"of her womanhood,  Beautiful, tender, grave and good  As the saints in time long olden.    And the days count not, nor the weeks avail;  For the child that went up the mountain trail  Came never again to Golden.    And the watchers wept in the midnight gloom,  Where the canyons yawn and the Selkirks loom,  For the love that they knew of olden.    And April dawned, with its suns aflame,  And the eagles wheeled and the vultures came  And poised o'er the town of Golden.    God of the white eternal peaks,  Guard the dead while the vulture seeks!--  God of the days so olden.    For only God in His greatness knows  Where the mountain holly above her grows,  On the trail that leads from Golden.        THE SONGSTER      Music, music with throb and swing,    Of a plaintive note, and long;  'Tis a note no human throat could sing,  No harp with its dulcet golden string,--  Nor lute, nor lyre with liquid ring,    Is sweet as the robin's song.    He sings for love of the season    When the days grow warm and long,  For the beautiful God-sent reason    That his breast was born for song.    Calling, calling so fresh and clear,    Through the song-sweet days of May;  Warbling there, and whistling here,  He swells his voice on the drinking ear,  On the great, wide, pulsing atmosphere    Till his music drowns the day.    He sings for love of the season    When the days grow warm and long,  For the beautiful God-sent reason    That his breast was born for song.        THISTLE-DOWN      Beyond a ridge of pine with russet tips  The west lifts to the sun her longing lips,    Her blushes stain with gold and garnet dye  The shore, the river and the wide far sky;    Like floods of wine the waters filter through  The reeds that brush our indolent canoe.    I beach the bow where sands in shadows lie;  You hold my hand a space, then speak good-bye.    Upwinds your pathway through the yellow plumes  Of goldenrod, profuse in August blooms,    And o'er its tossing sprays you toss a kiss;  A moment more, and I see only this--    The idle paddle you so lately held,  The empty bow your pliant wrist propelled,    Some thistles purpling into violet,  Their blossoms with a thousand thorns afret,    And like a cobweb, shadowy and grey,  Far floats their down--far drifts my dream away.        THE RIDERS OF THE PLAINS [2]      Who is it lacks the knowledge? Who are the curs that dare  To whine and sneer that they do not fear the whelps in the Lion's lair?  But we of the North will answer, while life in the North remains,  Let the curs beware lest the whelps they dare are the Riders of the Plains;  For these are the kind whose muscle makes the power of the Lion's jaw,  And they keep the peace of our people and the honour of British law.    A woman has painted a picture,--'tis a neat little bit of art  The critics aver, and it roused up for her the love of the big British heart.  'Tis a sketch of an English bulldog that tigers would scarce attack,  And round and about and beneath him is painted the Union Jack.  With its blaze of colour, and courage, its daring in every fold,  And underneath is the title, \"What we have we'll hold.\"  'Tis a picture plain as a mirror, but the reflex it contains  Is the counterpart of the life and heart of the Riders of the Plains;  For like to that flag and that motto, and the power of that bulldog's jaw,  They keep the peace of our people and the honour of British law.    These are the fearless fighters, whose life in the open lies,  Who never fail on the prairie trail 'neath the Territorial skies,  Who have laughed in the face of the bullets and the edge of the rebels' steel,  Who have set their ban on the lawless man with his crime beneath their heel;  These are the men who battle the blizzards, the suns, the rains,  These are the famed that the North has named the \"Riders of the Plains,\"  And theirs is the might and the meaning and the strength of the bulldog's jaw,  While they keep the peace of the people and the honour of British law.    These are the men of action, who need not the world's renown,  For their valour is known to England's throne as a gem in the British crown;  These are the men who face the front, whose courage the world may scan,  The men who are feared by the felon, but are loved by the honest man;  These are the marrow, the pith, the cream, the best that the blood contains,  Who have cast their days in the valiant ways of the Riders of the Plains;  And theirs is the kind whose muscle makes the power of old England's jaw,  And they keep the peace of her people and the honour of British law.    Then down with the cur that questions,--let him slink to his craven den,--  For he daren't deny our hot reply as to \"who are our mounted men.\"  He shall honour them east and westward, he shall honour them south and north,  He shall bare his head to that coat of red wherever that red rides forth.  'Tis well that he knows the fibre that the great North-West contains,  The North-West pride in her men that ride on the Territorial plains,--  For of such as these are the muscles and the teeth in the Lion's jaw,  And they keep the peace of our people and the honour of British law.        [2] The above is the Territorial pet name for the North-West Mounted    Police, and is in general usage throughout Assiniboia, Saskatchewan    and Alberta. At a dinner party in Boston the writer was asked, \"Who    are the North-West Mounted Police?\" and when told that they were the    pride of Canada's fighting men the questioner sneered and replied,    \"Ah! then they are only some of British Lion's whelps. We are not    afraid of them.\" His companions applauded the remark.        SILHOUETTE      The sky-line melts from russet into blue,  Unbroken the horizon, saving where  A wreath of smoke curls up the far, thin air,  And points the distant lodges of the Sioux.    Etched where the lands and cloudlands touch and die  A solitary Indian tepee stands,  The only habitation of these lands,  That roll their magnitude from sky to sky.    The tent poles lift and loom in thin relief,  The upward floating smoke ascends between,  And near the open doorway, gaunt and lean,  And shadow-like, there stands an Indian Chief.    With eyes that lost their lustre long ago,  With visage fixed and stern as fate's decree,  He looks towards the empty west, to see  The never-coming herd of buffalo.    Only the bones that bleach upon the plains,  Only the fleshless skeletons that lie  In ghastly nakedness and silence, cry  Out mutely that naught else to him remains.        A PRODIGAL      My heart forgot its God for love of you,    And you forgot me, other loves to learn;  Now through a wilderness of thorn and rue    Back to my God I turn.    And just because my God forgets the past,    And in forgetting does not ask to know  Why I once left His arms for yours, at last    Back to my God I go.        \"THROUGH TIME AND BITTER DISTANCE\" [3]      Unknown to you, I walk the cheerless shore.    The cutting blast, the hurl of biting brine  May freeze, and still, and bind the waves at war,    Ere you will ever know, O! Heart of mine,  That I have sought, reflected in the blue    Of these sea depths, some shadow of your eyes;  Have hoped the laughing waves would sing of you,    But this is all my starving sight descries--    I    Far out at sea a sail    Bends to the freshening breeze,  Yields to the rising gale    That sweeps the seas;    II    Yields, as a bird wind-tossed,    To saltish waves that fling  Their spray, whose rime and frost    Like crystals cling    III    To canvas, mast and spar,    Till, gleaming like a gem,  She sinks beyond the far    Horizon's hem.

It occurs in his sonnet, \"Rain.\"        AT HALF-MAST      You didn't know Billy, did you? Well, Bill was one of the boys,  The greatest fellow you ever seen to racket an' raise a noise,--  An' sing! say, you never heard singing 'nless you heard Billy sing.  I used to say to him, \"Billy, that voice that you've got there'd bring  A mighty sight more bank-notes to tuck away in your vest,  If only you'd go on the concert stage instead of a-ranchin' West.\"  An' Billy he'd jist go laughin', and say as I didn't know  A robin's whistle in springtime from a barnyard rooster's crow.  But Billy could sing, an' I sometimes think that voice lives anyhow,--  That perhaps Bill helps with the music in the place he's gone to now.    The last time that I seen him was the day he rode away;  He was goin' acrost the plain to catch the train for the East next day.  'Twas the only time I ever seen poor Bill that he didn't laugh  Or sing, an' kick up a rumpus an' racket around, and chaff,  For he'd got a letter from his folks that said for to hurry home,  For his mother was dyin' away down East an' she wanted Bill to come.  Say, but the feller took it hard, but he saddled up right away,  An' started across the plains to take the train for the East, next day.  Sometimes I lie awake a-nights jist a-thinkin' of the rest,  For that was the great big blizzard day, when the wind come down from west,  An' the snow piled up like mountains an' we couldn't put foot outside,  But jist set into the shack an' talked of Bill on his lonely ride.  We talked of the laugh he threw us as he went at the break o' day,  An' we talked of the poor old woman dyin' a thousand mile away.    Well, Dan O'Connell an' I went out to search at the end of the week,  Fer all of us fellers thought a lot,--a lot that we darsn't speak.  We'd been up the trail about forty mile, an' was talkin' of turnin' back,  But Dan, well, he wouldn't give in, so we kep' right on to the railroad track.  As soon as we sighted them telegraph wires says Dan, \"Say, bless my soul!  Ain't that there Bill's red handkerchief tied half way up that pole?\"  Yes, sir, there she was, with her"]]]
