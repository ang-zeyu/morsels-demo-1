[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6932"],[0,"Pictures Every Child Should Know (#11)"],[1,"money's worth.\"    Correggio did not receive very large sums for his work, and since he  was married and took good care of his family, he must have had some  source of income besides his brush. He received some interesting  rewards for his paintings. For example, for \"St. Jerome,\" called \"Il  Giorno,\" he was given \"400 gold imperials, some cartloads of faggots  and measures of wheat, and a fat pig.\" That picture is in the Parma  Gallery, and all the cupolas which he painted are in Parma churches.    Some of his pictures are signed; \"Leito,\" a synonym for his name,  \"Allegri.\" This indicates his style of art.    There is an interesting story told of how Correggio stood entranced  before a picture of Raphael's, and after long study of it he  exclaimed: \"I too, am a painter!\" showing at once his appreciation of  Raphael's greatness and satisfaction at his own genius.    Doubtless a good share of Correggio's comfortable living came from the  lady he married, since she was considered a rich woman for those times  and in that locality. Her name was Girolama Merlini, and she lived in  Mantua, the place where the Montagues and Capulets lived of whom  Shakespeare wrote the most wonderful love story ever imagined. This  young woman was only sixteen years old when Correggio met and loved  her, and very beautiful and later on he painted a picture,  \"Zingarella,\" for which his wife is said to have been the model. It  seems to have been a stroke of economy and enterprise for painters to  marry, since we read of so many who made fame and fortune through the  beauty of their wives.    They were very happy together, Correggio and his wife, and they had  four children. Their happiness was not for long, because Correggio  seems to have been but thirty-four years old when she died, nor did he  live to be old. There is a most curious tale of his death which is  probably not true, but it is worth telling since many have believed  it. He is supposed to have died in Correggio, of pleurisy, but the  story is that he had made a picture for one who had some grudge  against him, and who in order to irritate him paid him in copper,  fifty scudi. This was a considerable burden, and in order to save  expense and time, it is said that Correggio undertook to carry it home  alone. It was a very hot day, and he became so overheated and  exhausted with his heavy load that he took ill and died, and he may be  said literally to have been killed by \"too much money,\" if this were  true. Vasari, a biographer to be generally believed, says it is a  fact.    Correggio said that he always had his \"thoughts at the end of his  pencil,\" and there are those who impudently declare that is the only  place he _did_ have them, but that is a carping criticism, because he  was a very great artist, his greatest power being the presentation of  soft blendings of light and shade. There seem to have been few unusual  events in Correggio's life; very little that helps us to judge the  man, but there is a general opinion that he was a kind and devoted  father and husband, as well as a good citizen. With little demand upon  his moral character, he did his work, did it well, and his work alone  gave him place and fame.    He became the head of a school of painting and had many imitators, but  we hear little of his pupils, except that one of them was his own son,  Pompino, who lived to be very old, and in his turn was successful as  an artist.    Correggio was buried with honours in the Arrivabene Chapel, in the  Franciscan church at Correggio.      PLATE--THE HOLY NIGHT    This painting is not characteristic of Correggio's work, but  nevertheless it is very beautiful. The brilliant warm light which  comes from the Infant Jesus in His mother's arms is reflected upon the  faces of those gathered about, and even illuminates the angelic group  hovering above him. The slight landscape forming the background is  also suggestive, and the conditions of the birth are indicated by the  ass which may be seen in the middle distance. The faces of all are  joyous yet full of wonderment, the whole scene intimate and human.    The picture is also called the \"Adoration of the Shepherds,\" and that  title best tells the story. See the shepherdess shading her face with  one hand and offering two turtle-doves with the other. The ass in the  distance is the one on which Mary rode to Bethlehem, and Joseph is  caring for it. Even the cold light of the dawning day is softened by  the beauty of the group below. This picture is in the Royal Gallery in  Dresden.      PLATE--THE MYSTIC MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE    The Infant Jesus sits upon His mother's lap, and places the ring upon  St. Catherine's finger, while Mary's hand helps to guide that of her  Child. This action brings the three hands close together and adds to  the beauty of the composition. All of the faces are full of pleasure  and kindliness, while that of St. Sebastian fairly glows with happy  emotion. The light is concentrated upon the body of the Child and is  reflected upon the faces of the women. This painting hangs in the  Louvre.    Other great Correggio pictures are the \"School of Cupid,\" which is  more characteristic of his work; \"Antiope,\" \"Leda,\" \"Danae,\" and \"Ecce  Homo.\"          XII    PAUL GUSTAVE DORE        _French School_    1833-1883    This artist died in Paris twenty-five years ago, but there is little  as yet to be told of his life history. He was educated in Paris at the  Lycee Charlemagne, having gone there from Strasburg, where he was  born.    He was a painter of fantastic and grotesque subjects, and as far as we  know, he began his career when a boy. He made sketches before his  eighth year which attracted much attention, and he earned considerable  money while still at school. He was at that time engaged to illustrate  for journals, at a good round sum, and before he left the Lycee he had  made hundreds of drawings, somewhat after the satirical fashion of  Hogarth.    His work is very characteristic and once seen is likely to be always  recognised.    He first worked for the _Journal Pour Rire_, but then he undertook to  illustrate the work of Rabelais, the great satirist, whose text just  suited Dore's pencil. After Rabelais he illustrated Balzac, also the  \"Wandering Jew,\" \"Don Quixote,\" and Dante's \"Divine Comedy.\"    He undertook to do things which he could not do well, simply for the  money there was in the commissions. He had but a poor idea of colour  and his work was coarse, but it had such marked peculiarities that it  became famous. He did a little sculpture as well, and even that showed  his eccentricities of thought.      PLATE--MOSES BREAKING THE TABLETS OF THE LAW    This is one of the illustrations of the Dore Bible, published in  1865-66. The story is well known of how Moses went up into the Mount  of the Lord to receive the laws for the Israelites, which were written  upon tables of stone. Upon his descent from the Mount he found that  his followers had set up a golden calf, which they were worshipping;  and in his wrath Moses broke the tablets on which the Law was  inscribed. The power shown in his attitude, the affrighted faces of  the cowering Jews, the thunder and lightning as an expression of the  wrath of the Almighty are all painted in Dore's best manner.          XIII    ALBRECHT DUeRER        (Pronounced Dooer-rer')    _Nuremberg School_    1471-1528    _Pupil of Wolgemuth and Schongauer_    Albrecht Duerer by nationality was a Hungarian, but he was born in the  city of Nuremberg. His father had come from the little Hungarian town  of Eytas to Nuremberg that he might practise the craft of a  goldsmith. Notwithstanding his Hungarian origin, the name is German  and the family \"bearing,\" or sign, is the open door. This device  suggests that the name was first formed from \"Thurer,\" which means  \"carpenter,\" maker of doors.    The father became the goldworker for a master goldsmith of Nuremberg  named Hieronymus Holper, and very soon the new employee had fallen in  love with his master's daughter. The daughter was very young and very  beautiful; her name was Barbara, and as Herr Duerer was quite forty  years of age, while she was but fifteen, the match seemed most  unlikely, but they married and had eighteen children! The great  painter was one of them.    Albrecht loved his parents most tenderly, and from first to last we  hear no word of disagreement among any members of that immense  household. Young Albrecht was especially the companion of his father,  being brilliant, generous, and hard-working in a family where everyone  needed to do his best to help along. This love and companionship never  ceased until death, and after his parents died Albrecht wrote in a  touching manner of their death, describing his love for them, and  their many virtues. He was an author and a poet as well as a painter,  and only Leonardo da Vinci matched him for greatness and  versatility. We may know what Duerer's father looked like, since the  son made two portraits of him; one is to be seen in the Uffizi Gallery  at Florence and the other belongs to the Duke of Northumberland's  collection. The latter portrait has been reproduced in an engraving,  so that it is familiar to most people.    In the days when the great artist was growing up, Nuremberg was the  centre of all intellectuality and art in the North. The city of  Augsburg also followed art fashions, but it was far less important  than Nuremberg, because in the latter city every sort of art-craft was  followed in sincerity and with great originality.    In those days, the craft of the goldsmith was closely allied with the  profession of the painter, because the smith had to create his own  designs, and that called for much talent. Thus it was but a step from  designing in precious metals to the use of colour, and to  engraving. In making wood engravings, however, the drudgery of it was  left almost entirely to workmen, not artists.

[51] Their influence in these councils was, however, great,  and even paramount; for they commonly succeeded in securing to their  interest some of the most dexterous and influential of the conclave,  through whom, while they themselves remained in the background, they  managed the debates. [52]    [51] Lafitau, I. 479.  [52] The following from Lafitau is very characteristic: \"Ce que je dis  de leur zÃ¨le pour le bien public n'est cependant pas si universel, que  plusieurs ne pensent Ã  leur interÃªts particuliers, & que les Chefs  (sachems) principalement ne fassent joÃ¼er plusieurs ressorts secrets  pour venir Ã  bout de leurs intrigues. Il y en a tel, dont l'adresse jouÃ«  si bien Ã  coup sÃ»r, qu'il fait dÃ©liberer le Conseil plusieurs jours de  suite, sur une matiÃ¨re dont la dÃ©termination est arrÃªtÃ©e entre lui & les  principales tÃªtes avant d'avoir Ã©tÃ© mise sur le tapis. Cependant comme  les Chefs s'entre-regardent, & qu'aucun ne veut paroÃ®tre se donner une  superioritÃ© qui puisse piquer la jalousie, ils se mÃ©nagent dans les  Conseils plus que les autres; & quoiqu'ils en soient l'ame, leur  politique les oblige Ã  y parler peu, & Ã  Ã©couter plÃ»tÃ´t le sentiment  d'autrui, qu'Ã  y dire le leur; mais chacun a un homme Ã  sa main, qui est  comme une espÃ¨ce de BrÃ»lot, & qui Ã©tant sans consequence pour sa  personne hazarde en pleine libertÃ© tout ce qu'il juge Ã  propos, selon  qu'il l'a concertÃ© avec le Chef mÃªme pour qui il agit.\"--MÅurs des  Sauvages, I. 481.    There was a class of men among the Iroquois always put forward on public  occasions to speak the mind of the nation or defend its interests.  Nearly all of them were of the number of the subordinate chiefs. Nature  and training had fitted them for public speaking, and they were deeply  versed in the history and traditions of the league. They were in fact  professed orators, high in honor and influence among the people. To a  huge stock of conventional metaphors, the use of which required nothing  but practice, they often added an astute intellect, an astonishing  memory, and an eloquence which deserved the name.    In one particular, the training of these savage politicians was never  surpassed. They had no art of writing to record events, or preserve the  stipulations of treaties. Memory, therefore, was tasked to the utmost,  and developed to an extraordinary degree. They had various devices for  aiding it, such as bundles of sticks, and that system of signs, emblems,  and rude pictures, which they shared with other tribes. Their famous  wampum-belts were so many mnemonic signs, each standing for some act,  speech, treaty, or clause of a treaty. These represented the public  archives, and were divided among various custodians, each charged with  the memory and interpretation of those assigned to him. The meaning of  the belts was from time to time expounded in their councils. In  conferences with them, nothing more astonished the French, Dutch, and  English officials than the precision with which, before replying to  their addresses, the Indian orators repeated them point by point.    It was only in rare cases that crime among the Iroquois or Hurons was  punished by public authority. Murder, the most heinous offence, except  witchcraft, recognized among them, was rare. If the slayer and the slain  were of the same household or clan, the affair was regarded as a family  quarrel, to be settled by the immediate kin on both sides. This, under  the pressure of public opinion, was commonly effected without bloodshed,  by presents given in atonement. But if the murderer and his victim were  of different clans or different nations, still more, if the slain was a  foreigner, the whole community became interested to prevent the discord  or the war which might arise. All directed their efforts, not to bring  the murderer to punishment, but to satisfy the injured parties by a  vicarious atonement. [53] To this end, contributions were made and  presents collected. Their number and value were determined by  established usage. Among the Hurons, thirty presents of very  considerable value were the price of a man's life. That of a woman's was  fixed at forty, by reason of her weakness, and because on her depended  the continuance and increase of the population. This was when the slain  belonged to the nation. If of a foreign tribe, his death demanded a  higher compensation, since it involved the danger of war. [54] These  presents were offered in solemn council, with prescribed formalities.  The relatives of the slain might refuse them, if they chose, and in this  case the murderer was given them as a slave; but they might by no means  kill him, since, in so doing, they would incur public censure, and be  compelled in their turn to make atonement. Besides the principal gifts,  there was a great number of less value, all symbolical, and each  delivered with a set form of words: as, \"By this we wash out the blood  of the slain: By this we cleanse his wound: By this we clothe his corpse  with a new shirt: By this we place food on his grave\": and so, in  endless prolixity, through particulars without number. [55]    [53] Lalemant, while inveighing against a practice which made the  public, and not the criminal, answerable for an offence, admits that  heinous crimes were more rare than in France, where the guilty party  himself was punished.--Lettre au P. Provincial, 15 May, 1645.  [54] Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, 80.  [55] Ragueneau, Relation des Hurons, 1648, gives a description of one of  these ceremonies at length. Those of the Iroquois on such occasions were  similar. Many other tribes had the same custom, but attended with much  less form and ceremony. Compare Perrot, 73-76.    The Hurons were notorious thieves; and perhaps the Iroquois were not  much better, though the contrary has been asserted. Among both, the  robbed was permitted not only to retake his property by force, if he  could, but to strip the robber of all he had. This apparently acted as a  restraint in favor only of the strong, leaving the weak a prey to the  plunderer; but here the tie of family and clan intervened to aid him.  Relatives and clansmen espoused the quarrel of him who could not right  himself. [56]    [56] The proceedings for detecting thieves were regular and methodical,  after established customs. According to Bressani, no thief ever  inculpated the innocent.    Witches, with whom the Hurons and Iroquois were grievously infested,  were objects of utter abomination to both, and any one might kill them  at any time. If any person was guilty of treason, or by his character  and conduct made himself dangerous or obnoxious to the public, the  council of chiefs and old men held a secret session on his case,  condemned him to death, and appointed some young man to kill him. The  executioner, watching his opportunity, brained or stabbed him unawares,  usually in the dark porch of one of the houses. Acting by authority, he  could not be held answerable; and the relatives of the slain had no  redress, even if they desired it. The council, however, commonly  obviated all difficulty in advance, by charging the culprit with  witchcraft, thus alienating his best friends.    The military organization of the Iroquois was exceedingly imperfect and  derived all its efficiency from their civil union and their personal  prowess. There were two hereditary war-chiefs, both belonging to the  Senecas; but, except on occasions of unusual importance, it does not  appear that they took a very active part in the conduct of wars. The  Iroquois lived in a state of chronic warfare with nearly all the  surrounding tribes, except a few from whom they exacted tribute. Any man  of sufficient personal credit might raise a war-party when he chose. He  proclaimed his purpose through the village, sang his war-songs, struck  his hatchet into the war-post, and danced the war-dance. Any who chose  joined him; and the party usually took up their march at once, with a  little parched-corn-meal and maple-sugar as their sole provision. On  great occasions, there was concert of action,--the various parties  meeting at a rendezvous, and pursuing the march together. The leaders of  war-parties, like the orators, belonged, in nearly all cases, to the  class of subordinate chiefs. The Iroquois had a discipline suited to the  dark and tangled forests where they fought. Here they were a terrible  foe: in an open country, against a trained European force, they were,  despite their ferocious valor, far less formidable.    In observing this singular organization, one is struck by the  incongruity of its spirit and its form. A body of hereditary oligarchs  was the head of the nation, yet the nation was essentially democratic.  Not that the Iroquois were levellers. None were more prompt to  acknowledge superiority and defer to it, whether established by usage  and prescription, or the result of personal endowment. Yet each man,  whether of high or low degree, had a voice in the conduct of affairs,  and was never for a moment divorced from his wild spirit of  independence. Where there was no property worthy the name, authority had  no fulcrum and no hold. The constant aim of sachems and chiefs was to  exercise it without seeming to do so. They had no insignia of office.  They were no richer than others; indeed, they were often poorer,  spending their substance in largesses and bribes to strengthen their  influence. They hunted and fished for subsistence; they were as foul,  greasy, and unsavory as the rest; yet in them, withal, was often seen a  native dignity of bearing, which ochre and bear's grease could not hide,  and which comported well with their strong, symmetrical, and sometimes  majestic proportions.
