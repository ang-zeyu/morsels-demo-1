And of them, five belong to      Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin of      mankind till his death. This interval of time was little short of      three thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses      till the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, who reigned after      Xerxes; the prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was      done in their times in thirteen books. The remaining four books      contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct of human life.      It is true, our history hath been written since Artaxerxes very      particularly, but hath not been esteemed of the like authority with      the former by our forefathers, because there hath not been an exact      succession of prophets since that time; and how firmly we have      given credit to these books of our own nation, is evident by what      we do; for during so many ages as have already passed, no one hath      been so bold as either to add anything to them, to take anything      from them, or to make any change in them; but it is become natural      to all Jews, immediately and from their very birth, to esteem these      books to contain divine doctrines, and to persist in them, and, if      occasion be, willingly to die for them. For it is no new thing for      our captives, many of them in number, and frequently in time, to      be seen to endure racks and deaths of all kinds upon the theatres,      that they may not be obliged to say one word against our laws and      the records that contain them.\" (Antiquity of the Jews, Flavius      Josephus Against Apion, Book 1, pp. 582-583.)    2. _The Effect of Recent Discoveries in Chaldea and Egypt on the  Authorship of the Five Books in the Bible Ascribed to Moses:_        \"The Assyrian inscriptions which have been recently recovered and      given to the English-speaking peoples by Layard, George Smith,      Sayce, and others, show that in the ancient religions of Chaldea      and Babylonia there was elaborated a narrative of the creation      which, in its most important features, must have been the source      of that in our own sacred books. It has now become perfectly      clear that from the same sources which inspired the accounts of      the creation of the universe among the Chaldee-Babylonian, the      Assyrian, the Phoenician, and other ancient civilizations came the      ideas which hold so prominent a place in the sacred books of the      Hebrews. * * * * From this idea of creation was evolved in time a      somewhat nobler view. Ancient thinkers, and especially, as is now      found, in Egypt, suggested that the main agency in creation was      not the hands and fingers of the Creator, but his voice. Hence was      mingled with the earlier, cruder belief regarding the origin of the      earth and heavenly bodies by the Almighty the more impressive idea      that \"he spake and they were made\"--that they were brought into      existence by his word.\" (A History of the Warfare of Science with      Theology in Christendom, Vol. 1, pp. 2-3).    Referring again to the work of the noted Archaeologists mentioned  above, with others, Mr. White goes on to say that they \"have deciphered  a multitude of ancient texts, especially the inscriptions found in the  great library of Assurbanipal at Nineveh, and have discovered therein  an account of the origin of the world identical in its most important  features with the later accounts in our own book of Genesis. These  men have had the courage to point out these facts and to connect them  with the truth that these Chaldean and Babylonian myths, legends,  and theories were far earlier than those of the Hebrews, which so  strikingly resemble them, and which we have in our sacred books; and  they have also shown us how natural it was that the Jewish accounts  of the creation should have been obtained at that remote period when  the earliest Hebrews were among the Chaldeans, and how the great  Hebrew poetic accounts of creation were drawn either from the sacred  traditions of these earlier peoples or from antecedent sources common  to various ancient nations.\" (A History of the Warfare of Science with  Theology in Christendom, Vol. 1, p. 20.)    There can be no doubt but what the accounts of creation found in these  Assyrian and Egyptian sources are earlier than those written by Moses,  or that they are similar in import, but because of these facts is it  necessary to discredit either the Mosaic authorship of the five books  of the Bible accredited to that Prophet, or doubt the inspiration of  these accounts? And yet this has been the result of these discoveries  on many minds. The truth is, that the outlined facts of the creation  have been known by our race from earliest times, from the days of Adam  in fact. They were matters of common knowledge among the antediluvian  patriarchs, and through the family of Noah were preserved for the  families and races of men subsequent to the flood; and variously  distorted these creation facts were preserved by all people. But all  this did not prevent the Lord from revealing the creation history to  Moses, nor does it require us to doubt the inspiration which rested  upon him and that enabled him to weave into splendid coherent form  the fragmentary truths held among the ancient Egyptians and Assyrian  peoples. That there were pre-Mosaic documents containing accounts of  creation and the history of God's hand-dealings with ancient peoples,  we have abundant proof of in the Book of Abraham, which so strangely  came into the possession of the Prophet Joseph Smith (See Church  History, Vol. II, pp. 235-6, 348-350). Also that the Lord revealed  the creation facts, and also the early history of our race to Moses,  is confirmed by revelation to the Prophet of the nineteenth century,  Joseph Smith (See Pearl of Great Price, Book of Moses, pp. 1-48, also  History of the Church, Vol. I, 98 et seq.)    The student will find a well written article by Professor A. H. Sayce,  in \"The Bible Treasury,\" pp. 37-42, that bears upon this subject. The  matter is also discussed at some length in Young Men's Manual for  1903-4 (No. 7)., chap. I.    Furthermore, it should be noted that the writers of the New Testament  bear emphatic testimony to the authenticity and divine authority of the  Old Testament, since these writers so frequently quoted it as a work of  divine authority. \"Indeed,\" says an accepted authority in this class  of literature, \"the references are so numerous, and the testimonies  so distinctly borne to the existence of the Mosaic books throughout  the whole history of the Jewish nation, and the unity of character,  design and style pervading these books is so clearly perceptible,  notwithstanding the rationalistic assertions of their forming a series  of separate and unconnected fragments, that it may with all safety be  said, there is immensely stronger and more varied evidence in proof of  their being the authorship of Moses than of any of the Greek or Roman  classics being the productions of the authors whose names they bear.\"  (Commentary on the Old and New Testaments, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown,  preface.)    3. _Hagiographa:_ Hagiographa--the Greek name of the last of the three  Jewish divisions of the Old Testament. They are variously reckoned,  but usually comprise the Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles, Ruth,  Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and  Chronicles. (The Century Dictionary and Cyclopaedia, Vol. IX.)    4. _The Subdivisions of the Old Testament--Its Dignity and Authority:_  The student will observe that the classification of the books in the  several authorities cited, all vary somewhat in the grouping and  subdivisions of them; but I believe it will be found that the grouping  in the analysis of the Seventies' Bible Dictionary will be found most  complete and satisfactory. One thing should be borne in mind with  reference to this whole volume of ancient Hebrew scripture, and that  is, whatever the sub-division may be, history, legislation, poetry,  prophecy, biography, or proverbs, it is written under the inspiration  of God. That does not mean that human elements are not to be found in  it, but rather that a divine spirit is present in the midst of those  human elements giving forth light and truth and wisdom such as is to be  found in no merely human production. There is a divine spirit always  present in these scripture narratives, prophecies and poetry that make  the whole to contain a revelation of God, and an account of his methods  of doing things among men, all of which gives to those writings an  authority that does not pertain to the ordinary writings of men.

Art. 19. While the use of trained animals in stage performances  is not necessarily cruel, and while training operations are based  chiefly upon kindness and reward, it is necessary that vigilance  should be exercised to insure that the cages and stage quarters of  such animals shall be adequate in size, properly lighted and  acceptably ventilated, and that cruel punishments shall not be  inflicted upon the animals themselves.    Art. 20. The training of wild animals may, or may not, involve  cruelties, according to the intelligence and the moral status of  the trainer. This is equally true of the training of children, and  the treatment of wives and husbands. A reasonable blow with a  whip to a mean and refractory animal in captivity is not  necessarily an act of cruelty. Every such act must be judged  according to the evidence.    Art. 21. It is unjust to proclaim that \"all wild animal  performances are cruel\" and therefore should be prohibited by law.  The claim is untrue, and no lawmaker should pay heed to it. Wild  animal performances are no more cruel or unjust than men-and-women  performances of acrobatics. Practically all trained animals are  well fed and tended, they welcome their performances, and go  through them with lively interest. Such performances, when good,  have a high educational value,--but not to closed minds.    Art. 22. Every bull-fight, being brutally unfair to the horses and  the bull engaged and disgustingly cruel, is an unfit spectacle for  humane and high-minded people, and no Christian man or woman can  attend one without self-stultification.    Art. 23. The western practice of \"bulldogging,\" now permitted in  some Wild West shows, is disgusting, degrading, and never should  be permitted.    Art. 24. The use of monkeys by organ-grinders is cruel, it is  degrading to the monkeys, and should in all states be prohibited  by law.    Art. 25. The keeping of live fishes in glass globes nearly always  ends in cruelty and suffering, and should everywhere be prohibited  by law. A round glass straight-jacket is just as painful as any  other kind.    Art. 26. The sale and use of chained live chameleons as ornaments  and playthings for idiotic or vicious men and children always  means death by slow torture for the reptile, and should in all  states be prohibited by law.          II. MENTAL TRAITS OF WILD ANIMALS    VI    THE BRIGHTEST MINDS AMONG AMERICAN ANIMALS      We repeat that _the most interesting features of a wild animal  are its mind, its thoughts, and the results of its reasoning._  Besides these, its classification, distribution and anatomy are of  secondary importance; but at the same time they help to form the  foundation on which to build the psychology of species and  individuals. Let no student make the mistake of concluding that  when he has learned an animal's place in nature there is nothing  more to pursue.    After fifty years of practical experience with wild animals of  many species, I am reluctantly compelled to give the prize for  greatest cunning and foresight _in self-preservation_ to the  common brown rat,--the accursed \"domestic\" rat that has adopted  man as his perpetual servant, and regards man's goods as his  lawful prey. When all other land animals have been exterminated  from the earth, the brown rat will remain, to harry and to rob the  Last Man.    The brown rat has persistently accompanied man all over the world.  Millions have been spent in fighting him and the bubonic-plague  flea that he cheerfully carries in his offensive fur. For him no  place _that contains food_ is too hot or too cold, too wet or  too dry. Many old sailors claim to believe that rats will desert  at the dock an outward-bound ship that is fated to be lost at sea;  but that certificate of superhuman foreknowledge needs a backing  of evidence before it can be accepted.    Of all wild animals, rats do the greatest number of \"impossible\"  things. We have matched our wits against rat cunning until a  madhouse yawned before us. Twice in my life all my traps and  poisons have utterly failed, and left me faintly asking:  _Are_ rats possessed of occult powers? Once the answer to  that was furnished by an old he-one who left his tail in my steel  trap, but a little later _caught himself_ in a trap-like  space in the back of the family aeolian, and ignominiously died  there,--a victim of his own error in judging distances without a  tape line.    Tomes might be written about the minds and manners of the brown  rat, setting forth in detail its wonderful intelligence in quickly  getting wise to new food, new shelter, new traps and new poisons.  Six dead rats are, as a rule, sufficient to put any _new_  trap out of business; but poisons and infections go farther before  being found out. [Footnote: For home use, my best rat weapon is  rough-on-rats, generously mixed with butter and spread liberally  on very thin slices of bread. It has served me well in effecting  clearances.]    The championship for keen strategy in self-preservation belongs to  the musk-oxen for their wolf-proof circle of heads and horns.  Every musk-ox herd is a mutual benefit life insurance company.  When a gaunt and hungry wolf-pack appears, the adult bull and cow  musk-oxen at once form a close circle, with the calves and young  stock in the centre. That deadly ring of lowered heads and sharp  horns, all hung precisely right to puncture and deflate hostile  wolves, is impregnable to fang and claw. The arctic wolves know  this well. Mr. Stefansson says it is the settled habit of wolf  packs of Banks Land to pass musk-ox herds without even provoking  them to \"fall in\" for defense.    Judging by the facts that Charles L. Smith and the Norboe brothers  related to Mr. Phillips and me around our camp-fires in the  Canadian Rockies, the wolverine is one of the most cunning wild  animals of all North America. This is a large order; for the gray  wolf and grizzly bear are strong candidates for honors in that  contest.    The greatest cunning of the wolverine is manifested in robbing  traps, stealing the trapper's food and trap-baits, and at the same  time avoiding the traps set for him. He is wonderfully expert in  springing steel traps for the bait or prey there is in them,  without getting caught himself. He will follow up a trap line for  miles, springing all traps and devouring all baits as he goes.  Sometimes in sheer wantonness he will throw a trap into a river,  and again he will bury a trap in deep snow. Dead martens in traps  are savagely torn from them. Those that can not be eaten on the  spot are carried off and skilfully cached under two or three feet  of snow.    Trapper Smith once set a trap for a wolverine, and planted close  behind it a young moose skull with some flesh upon it. The  wolverine came in the night, started at a point well away from the  trap, dug a tunnel through six feet of snow, fetched up well  behind the trap,--and triumphantly dragged away the head through  his tunnel.    From the testimony of W. H. Wright, of Spokane, in his interesting  book on \"The Grizzly Bear,\" and for other reasons, I am convinced  that the Rocky Mountain silver-tip grizzly is our brightest North  American animal, and very keen of nose, eye, ear and brain. Mr.  Wright says that \"the grizzly bear far excels in cunning any other  animal found throughout the Rocky Mountains, and, for that matter,  he far excels them all combined.\" While the last clause is a large  order, I will not dispute the opinion of a man of keen  intelligence who has lived much among the most important and  interesting wild animals of the Rockies.    In the Bitter Root Mountains Mr. Wright and his hunting party once  set a bear trap for a grizzly, in a pen of logs, well baited with  fresh meat. On the second day they found the pen demolished, the  bait taken out, and everything that was movable piled on the top  of the trap.    The trap was again set, this time loosely, under a bed of moss.  The grizzly came and joyously ate all the meat that was scattered  around the trap, but the moss and the trap were left untouched.  And then followed a major operation in bear trapping. A mile away  there was a steep slope of smooth rock, bounded at its foot by a  creek. On one side was a huge tangle of down timber, on the other  side loomed some impassable rocks; and a tiny meadow sloped away  at the top. The half-fleshed carcasses of two dead elk were thrown  half way down the rock slide, to serve as a bait. On the two sides  two bear guns were set, and to their triggers were attached two  long silk fish-lines, stretched taut and held parallel to each  other, extending across the rocky slope. The idea was that the  bear could not by any possibility reach the bait from above or  below, without setting off at least one gun, and getting a bullet  through his shoulders.    On the first night, no guns went off. The next morning it was  found that the bear had crossed the stream and climbed straight up  toward the bait until he reached the first fish-line; where he  stopped. Without pressing the string sufficiently to set off its  gun, he followed it to the barrier of trees. Being balked there,  he turned about, retraced his steps carefully and followed the  string to the barrier of rocks. Being blocked there, he back-  tracked down the slide and across the stream, over the way he  came. Then he widely circled the whole theatre, and came down  toward the bait from the little meadow at its top of the slide.    Presently he reached the upper fish-line, twelve feet away from  the first one. First he followed this out to the log barrier, then  back to the rock ledge that was supposed to be unclimbable. There  he scrambled up the \"impossible\""]]]
