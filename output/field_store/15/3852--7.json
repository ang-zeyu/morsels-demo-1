Whoever the borer was, he did his work far more thoroughly than  Claudius ages afterwards did his for the Fucine lake, which work it  has been left for the Torlonia of our own day to finish. But no one,  we may suppose, wished at any time to drain the Alban lake, but only  to keep it in order. How needful such a work is we do not fully grasp  till we can look down from above. Then we take in the strict accuracy  of the name _crater_. We see the two lakes, greater and smaller, side  by side, like two basins in the strictest sense, in which, at some  time which geologists may fix, but which it is enough for history to  say that it was long before the oldest primaeval wall, the powers of  water supplanted those of fire. We take in how the larger lake, with  its narrow rim, in some parts of its circuit with its low rim, liable  to be swollen, but with no natural outlet for its waters, might easily  come to overflow, if artificial means had not been, in some early time,  taken to check it.    But when we have wound our way by the rim of the lake, by the house  which the so-called Prisoner of the Vatican never chooses to visit, by  the rock which still bears his name, when we have crossed the so-called  fields of Hannibal--yet another crater, science tells us--when we have  climbed by the triumphal way to the height of Monte Cavo, we do indeed  understand the geography and history of Rome and Latium better than  we did before. The eye may range over the height of Tusculum and over  the battle-ground of Regillus as far as the height of Praeneste; it  may range hither and thither over many points which have their charm  both of history and of nature. But there are two sides to which the  historical eye will be attracted before all others. Such a gazer will  better take in the position of Rome, as he sees it, with its seven  hills shrunk out of sight, a point--rather a line--in the Latin plain,  with a wall of Etruscan hills beyond it. We see how utterly different  was the position of Rome from the position of the elder cities; we see  how she lies in the midst, at the very meeting-place of nations; we  see how needful for her it was to make the barrier behind her her own;  and we understand her wars with Veii better than before. But we look  down too on the Latin plain itself: we look down, we believe, on the  vanished site of Rome's mother at our feet; we look out on the great  flat once fringed with cities, and on the great and wide sea beyond it.  Here, standing forth as an advanced post of the land, we see where         ... the Witch's Fortress       O'erhangs the dark-blue seas.    And beyond Circeii and its island satellites, we look on to the more  distant height, in so many ages the boundary height, best known as  a height by the name of Anxur, but known as a boundary by the name  of Terracina. When we think how early Rome became the mistress,  not only of the height on which we stand and of the kindred heights  around it, but of that long coast-line and its protecting heights, we  feel why Rome, so early in her history, had to enter on a career of  wide-spreading policy, which could never have suggested itself to a  power seated at Veii or at Praeneste. Rome, on her great river, with  her haven at its mouth, with her long line of sea-faring subjects or  allies, felt from a very early time the friendship or enmity of the  great powers of the sea to be an important matter. She had to dread  Etruscan pirates and Phoenician traders; the Greek of Cumae might  perhaps do something more against her than merely shelter her tyrants.  We may believe or not in the connexion between the Alban lake and the  fall of Veii, but, as we look one way from beside the few stones that  are left of Jove's loftiest temple, we understand how needful it was  that Juno of Veii should move to Rome. We may or we may not have the  camping-ground of Hannibal behind us; but as we look out seawards we  believe in the first treaty with Carthage; we go on to wonder how  things had turned about, when Duilius and Lutatius could break the  Carthaginian power by sea, and when Hannibal could make his way into  Italy by land.          Cori.      There was some reason in the remark made by Mr. Creighton in the  Academy a little time back, that there must be something \"irritating to  the Italians of the present date in the point of view which is often  adopted by English writers towards Italian history.\" \"Their cities,\"  he said, \"which are still instinct with political and social life, are  regarded as museums of curiosities, which serve to awaken picturesque  reminiscences in the mind of the passing tourist.\" Mr. Creighton was  speaking of Genoa, and at Genoa and in cities like Genoa, what he  says may be perfectly true. But there are other Italian cities where  the political and social life at least hides itself from the passing  tourist, and where the curiosity with which he regards the city is as  nothing compared with the curiosity with which the inhabitants of the  city seem to regard him. The curiosity is not specially irritating;  it is perhaps mixed up with a certain open craving after _soldi_  which nothing short of the very highest civilization can get rid  of; but it is quite distinct from the endless touting and wearying  which the traveller has to undergo in places which are one degree  more advanced, or which, to speak more civilly, have fallen less  far back. For it is only civil to believe of cities which were once  independent commonwealths, members of the League of the Thirty Cities,  and, therefore, doubtless instinct with political life, that they  were, at least two or three millenniums back, cleaner than they are  now, and filled with inhabitants who had something more to do than  their successors seem to have. But the interest which the novelty  of the stranger awakens in the minds of the present inhabitants--far  keener, it would seem, than the interest which the antiquity of the  city awakens in his mind--really does him no harm. The modern Latins  or Volscians come and look; they wonder; they follow. If the nature of  the country requires that the strangers be set on asses and mules, the  curiosity, as is only natural, reaches its height. The asses of the  Prisci Latini or of their Volscian neighbours are undoubtedly grave  and discreet beasts; even the obstinacy of the mule is a virtue when  he knows the way so much better than his foreign rider. But there is  something grotesque in the way of going; it is not wonderful if the  sight gathers together a crowd, if the travellers find themselves the  centre, not exactly of triumph, for they are not drawn in a chariot;  not exactly of an ovation, for they do not walk on foot; but of a not  ill-humoured procession of gazers, it may even be of admirers.    Something of this kind is likely to be the destiny, at some point at  least, of those who wish to carry out the full programme of the right  wing of the Latin host of Regillus:         Aricia, Cora, Norba,       Velitrae, with the might       Of Setia and of Tusculum.    Tusculum they will, perhaps, have made the object of a separate  pilgrimage; Aricia belongs to the following of Jupiter and the Alban  mount; \"Setia's purple vineyards\" it may be hard to take into the line  of march; but, with a slight change of order, \"Velitrae, Cora, Norba,\"  with the later Ninfa thrown in as a substitute for neglected Setia,  will form an admirable group, a day's journey, which those who have  made it will perhaps, at the end of a day or two, feel sorry that  they have not cut into two. Velitrae--hardly changed in the modern  Velletri--has itself but little to show beyond one of the very noblest  bell-towers of the second Italian period, where the pointed arch creeps  in, a visitor which in Italy is better away, but which at least keeps  out the vagaries of a yet later time. The lie of the town is good;  it stands well on its hill, of no great elevation among its brighter  neighbours. Besides the bell-tower, it has little to show in the  ecclesiastical line, save only the eccentricity of having its cathedral  church placed as if we were in Wales instead of in Italy, at the bottom  of the city instead of at the top. One or two ancient houses and modern  palaces may claim some attention, but Velletri, truly barren in Roman  remains, cannot be said to be fruitful in those of mediaeval times. The  chief value of the town is as a starting-point--we can hardly call it  centre--for Cora, Norba, and several other of its ancient fellows. The  view from Velletri is beyond words. We look over the fertile plain,  dying away to the right into the Pomptine marshes, and fenced in by the  mighty limestone bulwark of the Volscian mountains. To the right of all  the height of Anxur's temple looms in the distance; Circeii, with its  following of islands, rises nearer and more plainly, almost itself like  a great island, reminding the visitor from the West of England of Brean  Down and the Holms in the Severn Sea. But the mountains draw the eyes  towards them by something more than their bright masses, something more  than a light and shade upon their sides. Several of their strong points  are crowned with castles and whole towns; and one point so crowned  stands out as the centre of all. We see one spur of the mountain, far  lower than the heights beyond it, crowned by a little city coming some  way down its sides, with a tall tower rising well from the midst when  the sunlight catches it. There stands one of the chief objects for  which Velletri is the starting-point; there we have to look for--         ... the gigantic watch-towers,         No work of earthly men,       Whence Cora's sentinel's o'erlook         The never-ending fen.

CHAPTER III.    CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY BELIEVERS.    Meaning of Christian Doctrine, Understood by a Minority, has Become  Completely Incomprehensible for the Majority of Men--Reason of this to  be Found in Misinterpretation of Christianity and Mistaken Conviction of  Believers and Unbelievers Alike that they Understand it--The Meaning of  Christianity Obscured for Believers by the Church--The First Appearance  of Christ's Teaching--Its Essence and Difference from Heathen  Religions--Christianity not Fully Comprehended at the Beginning, Became  More and More Clear to those who Accepted it from its Correspondence  with Truth--Simultaneously with this Arose the Claim to Possession of  the Authentic Meaning of the Doctrine Based on the Miraculous Nature of  its Transmission--Assembly of Disciples as Described in the Acts--The  Authoritative Claim to the Sole Possession of the True Meaning of  Christ's Teaching Supported by Miraculous Evidence has Led by Logical  Development to the Creeds of the Churches--A Church Could Not be Founded  by Christ--Definitions of a Church According to the Catechisms--The  Churches have Always been Several in Number and Hostile to One  Another--What is Heresy--The Work of G. Arnold on Heresies--Heresies the  Manifestations of Progress in the Churches--Churches Cause Dissension  among Men, and are Always Hostile to Christianity--Account of the Work  Done by the Russian Church--Matt. xxiii. 23--The Sermon on the Mount or  the Creed--The Orthodox Church Conceals from the People the True Meaning  of Christianity--The Same Thing is Done by the Other Churches--All the  External Conditions of Modern Life are such as to Destroy the Doctrine  of the Church, and therefore the Churches use Every Effort to Support  their Doctrines.      Thus the information I received, after my book came out, went to  show that the Christian doctrine, in its direct and simple sense,  was understood, and had always been understood, by a minority of  men, while the critics, ecclesiastical and freethinking alike,  denied the possibility of taking Christ's teaching in its direct  sense.  All this convinced me that while on one hand the true  understanding of this doctrine had never been lost to a minority,  but had been established more and more clearly, on the other hand  the meaning of it had been more and more obscured for the  majority.  So that at last such a depth of obscurity has been  reached that men do not take in their direct sense even the  simplest precepts, expressed in the simplest words, in the Gospel.    Christ's teaching is not generally understood in its true, simple,  and direct sense even in these days, when the light of the Gospel  has penetrated even to the darkest recesses of human  consciousness; when, in the words of Christ, that which was spoken  in the ear is proclaimed from the housetops; and when the Gospel  is influencing every side of human life--domestic, economic,  civic, legislative, and international.  This lack of true  understanding of Christ's words at such a time would be  inexplicable, if there were not causes to account for it.    One of these causes is the fact that believers and unbelievers  alike are firmly persuaded that they have understood Christ's  teaching a long time, and that they understand it so fully,  indubitably, and conclusively that it can have no other  significance than the one they attribute to it.  And the reason of  this conviction is that the false interpretation and consequent  misapprehension of the Gospel is an error of such long standing.  Even the strongest current of water cannot add a drop to a cup  which is already full.    The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man  if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing  cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly  persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid  before him.    The Christian doctrine is presented to the men of our world to-day  as a doctrine which everyone has known so long and accepted so  unhesitatingly in all its minutest details that it cannot be  understood in any other way than it is understood now.    Christianity is understood now by all who profess the doctrines of  the Church as a supernatural miraculous revelation of everything  which is repeated in the Creed.  By unbelievers it is regarded as  an illustration of man's craving for a belief in the supernatural,  which mankind has now outgrown, as an historical phenomenon which  has received full expression in Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, and  Protestantism, and has no longer any living significance for us.  The significance of the Gospel is hidden from believers by the  Church, from unbelievers by Science.    I will speak first of the former.  Eighteen hundred years ago  there appeared in the midst of the heathen Roman world a strange  new doctrine, unlike any of the old religions, and attributed to a  man, Christ.    This new doctrine was in both form and content absolutely new to  the Jewish world in which it originated, and still more to the  Roman world in which it was preached and diffused.    In the midst of the elaborate religious observances of Judaism, in  which, in the words of Isaiah, law was laid upon law, and in the midst  of the Roman legal system worked out to the highest point of perfection,  a new doctrine appeared, which denied not only every deity, and all fear  and worship of them, but even all human institutions and all necessity  for them. In place of all the rules of the old religions, this doctrine  sets up only a type of inward perfection, truth, and love in the person  of Christ, and--as a result of this inward perfection being attained by  men--also the outward perfection foretold by the Prophets--the kingdom  of God, when all men will cease to learn to make war, when all shall be  taught of God and united in love, and the lion will lie down with the  lamb. Instead of the threats of punishment which all the old laws of  religions and governments alike laid down for non-fulfillment of their  rules, instead of promises of rewards for fulfillment of them, this  doctrine called men to it only because it was the truth. John vii. 17:  \"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it  be of God.\" John viii. 46: \"If I say the truth, why do ye not believe  me? But ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth. Ye shall  know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. God is a spirit, and  they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Keep my  sayings, and ye shall know of my sayings whether they be true.\" No  proofs of this doctrine were offered except its truth, the  correspondence of the doctrine with the truth. The whole teaching  consisted in the recognition of truth and following it, in a greater and  greater attainment of truth, and a closer and closer following of it in  the acts of life. There are no acts in this doctrine which could justify  a man and make him saved. There is only the image of truth to guide-him,  for inward perfection in the person of Christ, and for outward  perfection in the establishment of the kingdom of God. The fulfillment  of this teaching consists only in walking in the chosen way, in getting  nearer to inward perfection in the imitation of Christ, and outward  perfection in the establishment of the kingdom of God. The greater or  less blessedness of a man depends, according to this doctrine, not on  the degree of perfection to which he has attained, but on the greater or  less swiftness with which he is pursuing it.    The progress toward perfection of the publican Zaccheus, of the woman  that was a sinner, of the robber on the cross, is a greater state of  blessedness, according to this doctrine, than the stationary  righteousness of the Pharisee. The lost sheep is dearer than ninety-nine  that were not lost. The prodigal son, the piece of money that was lost  and found again, are dearer, more precious to God than those which have  not been lost.    Every condition, according to this doctrine, is only a particular  step in the attainment of inward and outward perfection, and  therefore has no significance of itself.  Blessedness consists in  progress toward perfection; to stand still in any condition  whatever means the cessation of this blessedness.    \"Let not thy left hand know what they right hand doeth.\"  \"No man  having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the  Kingdom of God.\"  \"Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to  you, but seek rather that your names be written in heaven.\"  \"Be  ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect.\"  \"Seek ye  first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness.\"    The fulfillment of this precept is only to be found in  uninterrupted progress toward the attainment of ever higher truth,  toward establishing more and more firmly an ever greater love  within oneself, and establishing more and more widely the kingdom  of God outside oneself.    It is obvious that, appearing as it did in the midst of the Jewish  and heathen world, such teaching could not be accepted by the  majority of men, who were living a life absolutely different from  what was required by it.  It is obvious, too, that even for those  by whom it was accepted, it was so absolutely opposed to all their  old views that it could not be comprehensible in its full  significance.    It has been only by a succession of misunderstandings, errors,  partial explanations, and the corrections and additions of  generations that the meaning of the Christian doctrine has grown  continually more and more clear to men.
