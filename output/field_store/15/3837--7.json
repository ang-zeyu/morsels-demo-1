Besides stolen property, these boxes contained  evidence of the identity of Ward with Peace. A constable who had known  Peace well in Sheffield was sent to Newgate, and taken into the yard  where the prisoners awaiting trial were exercising. As they passed  round, the constable pointed to the fifth man: \"That's Peace,\" he said,  \"I'd know him anywhere.\" The man left the ranks and, coming up to the  constable, asked earnestly, \"What do you want me for?\" but the Governor  ordered him to go on with his walk.    It was as John Ward, alias Charles Peace, that Peace, on November 19,  1878, was put on his trial for burglary and the attempted murder of  Police Constable Robinson, at the Old Bailey before Mr. Justice Hawkins.  His age was given in the calendar as sixty, though Peace was actually  forty-six. The evidence against the prisoner was clear enough. All Mr.  Montagu Williams could urge in his defence was that Peace had never  intended to kill the officer, merely to frighten him. The jury found  Peace guilty of attempted murder. Asked if he had anything to say why  judgment should not be passed upon him, he addressed the Judge. He  protested that he had not been fairly dealt with, that he never intended  to kill the prosecutor, that the pistol was one that went off very  easily, and that the last shot had been fired by accident. \"I really did  not know,\" he said, \"that the pistol was loaded, and I hope, my lord,  that you will have mercy on me. I feel that I have disgraced myself, I  am not fit either to live or die. I am not prepared to meet my God, but  still I feel that my career has been made to appear much worse than it  really is. Oh, my lord, do have mercy on me; do give me one chance of  repenting and of preparing to meet my God. Do, my lord, have mercy on  me; and I assure you that you shall never repent it. As you hope for  mercy yourself at the hands of the great God, do have mercy on me, and  give me a chance of redeeming my character and preparing myself to meet  my God. I pray, and beseech you to have mercy upon me.\"    Peace's assumption of pitiable senility, sustained throughout the trial,  though it imposed on Sir Henry Hawkins, failed to melt his heart. He  told Peace that he did not believe his statement that he had fired the  pistol merely to frighten the constable; had not Robinson guarded  his head with his arm he would have been wounded fatally, and Peace  condemned to death. He did not consider it necessary, he said, to make  an inquiry into Peace's antecedents; he was a desperate burglar, and  there was an end of the matter. Notwithstanding his age, Mr. Justice  Hawkins felt it his duty to sentence him to penal servitude for life.  The severity of the sentence was undoubtedly a painful surprise  to Peace; to a man of sixty years of age it would be no doubt less  terrible, but to a man of forty-six it was crushing.    Not that Peace was fated to serve any great part of his sentence.    With as little delay as possible he was to be called on to answer to  the murder of Arthur Dyson. The buxom widow of the murdered man had been  found in America, whither she had returned after her husband's death.  She was quite ready to come to England to give evidence against  her husband's murderer. On January 17, 1879, Peace was taken from  Pentonville prison, where he was serving his sentence, and conveyed by  an early morning train to Sheffield. There at the Town Hall he appeared  before the stipendiary magistrate, and was charged with the murder of  Arthur Dyson. When he saw Mrs. Dyson enter the witness box and tell her  story of the crime, he must have realised that his case was desperate.  Her cross-examination was adjourned to the next hearing, and Peace was  taken back to London. On the 22nd, the day of the second hearing in  Sheffield, an enormous crowd had assembled outside the Town Hall. Inside  the court an anxious and expectant audiience{sic}, among them Mrs.  Dyson, in the words of a contemporary reporter, \"stylish and cheerful,\"  awaited the appearance of the protagonist. Great was the disappointment  and eager the excitement when the stipendiary came into the court about  a quarter past ten and stated that Peace had attempted to escape that  morning on the journey from London to Sheffield, and that in consequence  of his injuries the case would be adjourned for eight days.    What had happened was this. Peace had left King's Cross by the 5.15  train that morning, due to arrive at Sheffield at 8.45. From the very  commencement of the journey he had been wilful and troublesome. He kept  making excuses for leaving the carriage whenever the train stopped.  To obviate this nuisance the two warders, in whose charge he was, had  provided themselves with little bags which Peace could use when he  wished and then throw out of the window. Just after the train passed  Worksop, Peace asked for one of the bags. When the window was lowered  to allow the bag to be thrown away, Peace with lightning agility took a  flying leap through it. One of the warders caught him by the left foot.  Peace, hanging from the carriage, grasped the footboard with his hands  and kept kicking the warder as hard as he could with his right foot.  The other warder, unable to get to the window to help his colleague, was  making vain efforts to stop the train by pulling the communication cord.  For two miles the train ran on, Peace struggling desperately to escape.  At last he succeeded in kicking off his left shoe, and dropped on to the  line. The train ran on another mile until, with the assistance of some  gentlemen in other carriages, the warders were able to get it pulled up.  They immediately hurried back along the line, and there, near a place  called Kineton Park, they found their prisoner lying in the footway,  apparently unconscious and bleeding from a severe wound in the scalp. A  slow train from Sheffield stopped to pick up the injured man. As he was  lifted into the guard's van, he asked them to cover him up as he was  cold. On arriving at Sheffield, Peace was taken to the Police Station  and there made as comfortable as possible in one of the cells. Even then  he had energy enough to be troublesome over taking the brandy ordered  for him by the surgeon, until one of the officers told \"Charley\" they  would have none of his hanky-panky, and he had got to take it. \"All  right,\" said Peace, \"give me a minute,\" after which he swallowed  contentedly a couple of gills of the genial spirit.    Peace's daring feat was not, according to his own account, a mere  attempt to escape from the clutches of the law; it was noble and Roman  in its purpose. This is what he told his stepson, Willie Ward: \"I saw  from the way I was guarded all the way down from London and all the way  back, when I came for my first trial, that I could not get away from the  warders, and I knew I could not jump from an express train without being  killed. I took a look at Darnall as I went down and as I went back, and  after I was put in my cell, I thought it all over. I felt that I could  not get away, and then I made up my mind to kill myself. I got two bits  of paper and pricked on them the words, 'Bury me at Darnall. God bless  you all!' With a bit of black dirt that I found on the floor of my cell  I wrote the same words on another piece of paper, and then I hid them in  my clothes. My hope was that, when I jumped from the train I should be  cut to pieces under the wheels. Then I should have been taken to the  Duke of York (a public-house at Darnall) and there would have been an  inquest over me. As soon as the inquest was over you would have claimed  my body, found the pieces of paper, and then you would have buried me at  Darnall.\"    This statement of Peace is no doubt in the main correct. But it is  difficult to believe that there was not present to his mind the sporting  chance that he might not be killed in leaping from the train, in which  event he would no doubt have done his best to get away, trusting to his  considerable powers of ingenious disguise to elude pursuit. But such a  chance was remote. Peace had faced boldly the possibility of a dreadful  death.    With that strain of domestic sentiment, which would appear to have been  a marked characteristic of his family, Peace was the more ready to  cheat the gallows in the hope of being by that means buried decently at  Darnall. It was at Darnall that he had spent some months of comparative  calm in his tempestuous career, and it was at Darnall that he had first  met Mrs. Dyson. Another and more practical motive that may have urged  Peace to attempt to injure seriously, if not kill himself, was the  hope of thereby delaying his trial. If the magisterial investigation  in Sheffield were completed before the end of January, Peace could be  committed for trial to the ensuing Leeds Assizes which commenced in the  first week in February. If he were injured too seriously, this would not  be possible. Here again he was doomed to disappointment.    Peace recovered so well from the results of his adventure on the railway  that the doctor pronounced him fit to appear for his second examination  before the magistrate on January 30. To avoid excitement, both on  the part of the prisoner and the public, the court sat in one of the  corridors of the Town Hall. The scene is described as dismal, dark and  cheerless. The proceedings took place by candlelight, and Peace, who was  seated in an armchair, complained frequently of the cold. At other times  he moaned and groaned and protested against the injustice with which  he was being treated. But the absence of any audience rather dashed the  effect of his laments.    The most interesting part of the proceedings was the cross-examination  of Mrs. Dyson by Mr. Clegg, the prisoner's solicitor.    Its purpose was to show that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],[0,"The Psychology of Revolution (#11)"],[1,"opulace.    The Mayor of Troyes, his eyes destroyed by blows of scissors, was  murdered after hours of suffering.  The Colonel of Dragoons  Belzuce was cut to pieces while living.  In many places the  hearts of the victims were torn out and carried about the cities  on the point of a pike.    Such is the behaviour of the base populace so soon as imprudent  hands have broken the network of constraints which binds its  ancestral savagery.  It meets with every indulgence because it is  in the interests of the politicians to flatter it.  But let us  for a moment suppose the thousands of beings who constitute it  condensed into one single being.  The personality thus formed  would appear as a cruel and narrow and abominable monster, more  horrible than the bloodiest tyrants of history.    This impulsive and ferocious people has always been easily  dominated so soon as a strong power has opposed it.  If its  violence is unlimited, so is its servility.  All the despotisms  have had it for their servant.  The Caesars are certain of  being acclaimed by it, whether they are named Caligula, Nero,  Marat, Robespierre, or Boulanger.    Beside these destructive hordes whose action during revolution is  capital, there exists, as we have already remarked, the mass of  the true people, which asks only the right to labour.  It  sometimes benefits by revolutions, but never causes them.  The  revolutionary theorists know little of it and distrust it, aware  of its traditional and conservative basis.  The resistant nucleus  of a country, it makes the strength and continuity of the latter.    Extremely docile through fear, easily influenced by its leaders,  it will momentarily commit every excess while under their  influence, but the ancestral inertia of the race will soon take  charge again, which is the reason why it so quickly tires of  revolution.  Its traditional soul quickly incites it to oppose  itself to anarchy when the latter goes too far.  At such times it  seeks the leader who will restore order.    This people, resigned and peaceable, has evidently no very lofty  nor complicated political conceptions.  Its governmental ideal is  always very simple, is something very like dictatorship.  This is  why, from the times of the Greeks to our own, dictatorship has  always followed anarchy.  It followed it after the first  Revolution, when Bonaparte was acclaimed, and again when, despite  opposition, four successive plebiscites raised Louis Napoleon to  the head of the republic, ratified his coup d'etat,  re-established the Empire, and in 1870, before the war, approved  of his rule.    Doubtless in these last instances the people was deceived.  But  without the revolutionary conspiracies which led to disorder, it  would not have been impelled to seek the means of escape  therefrom.    The facts recalled in this chapter must not be forgotten if we  wish fully to comprehend the various roles of the people  during revolution.  Its action is considerable, but very unlike  that imagined by the legends whose repetition alone constitutes  their vitality.        BOOK II    THE FORMS OF MENTALITY PREVALENT DURING REVOLUTION    CHAPTER I    INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS OF CHARACTER IN TIME OF REVOLUTION    1.  Transformations of Personality.    I have dwelt at length elsewhere upon a certain theory of  character, without which it is absolutely impossible to  understand divers transformations or inconsistencies of conduct  which occur at certain moments, notably in time of revolution.  Here are the principal points of this theory:    Every individual possesses, besides his habitual mentality,  which, when the environment does not alter, is almost constant,  various possibilities of character which may be evoked by passing  events.    The people who surround us are the creatures of certain  circumstances, but not of all circumstances.  Our ego consists of  the association of innumerable cellular egos, the residues of  ancestral personalities.  By their combination they form an  equilibrium which is fairly permanent when the social environment  does not vary.  As soon as this environment is considerably  modified, as in time of insurrection, this equilibrium is broken,  and the dissociated elements constitute, by a fresh aggregation,  a new personality, which is manifested by ideas, feelings, and  actions very different from those formerly observed in the same  individual.  Thus it is that during the Terror we see honest  bourgeois and peaceful magistrates who were noted for their  kindness turned into bloodthirsty fanatics.    Under the influence of environment the old personality may  therefore give place to one entirely new.  For this reason the  actors in great religious and political crises often seem of a  different essence to ourselves; yet they do not differ from us;  the repetition of the same events would bring back the same men.    Napoleon perfectly understood these possibilities of character  when he said, in Saint Helena:--    ``It is because I know just how great a part chance plays in our  political decisions, that I have always been without prejudices,  and very indulgent as to the part men have taken during our  disturbances. . . .  In time of revolution one can only say what  one has done; it would not be wise to say that one could not have  done otherwise. . . .  Men are difficult to understand if we want  to be just. . . .  Do they know themselves?  Do they account for  themselves very clearly?  There are virtues and vices of  circumstance.''    When the normal personality has been disaggregated under the  influence of certain events, how does the new personality form  itself?  By several means, the most active of which is the  acquisition of a strong belief.  This orientates all the elements  of the understanding, as the magnet collects into regular  curves the filings of a magnetic metal.    Thus were formed the personalities observed in times of great  crises: the Crusades, the Reformation, the Revolution notably.    At normal times the environment varies little, so that as a rule  we see only a single personality in the individuals that surround  us.  Sometimes, however, it happens that we observe several,  which in certain circumstances may replace one another.    These personalities may be contradictory and even inimical.  This  phenomenon, exceptional under normal conditions, is considerably  accentuated in certain pathological conditions.  Morbid  psychology has recorded several examples of multiple personality  in a single subject, such as the cases cited by Morton Prince and  Pierre Janet.    In all these variations of personality it is not the intelligence  which is modified, but the feelings, whose association forms the  character.      2.  Elements of Character Predominant in Time of Revolution.      During revolution we see several sentiments developed which are  commonly repressed, but to which the destruction of social  constraints gives a free vent.    These constraints, consisting of the law, morality, and  tradition, are not always completely broken.  Some survive the  upheaval and serve to some extent to damp the explosion of  dangerous sentiments.    The most powerful of these restraints is the soul of the race.  This determines a manner of seeing, feeling, and willing  common to the majority of the individuals of the same people; it  constitutes a hereditary custom, and nothing is more powerful  than the ties of custom.    This racial influence limits the variations of a people and  determines its destiny within certain limits in spite of all  superficial changes.    For example, to take only the instances of history, it would seem  that the mentality of France must have varied enormously during a  single century.  In a few years it passed from the Revolution to  Caesarism, returned to the monarchy, effected another  Revolution, and then summoned a new Caesar.  In reality only  the outsides of things had changed.    We cannot insist further here on the limits of national  variability, but must now consider the influence of certain  affective elements, whose development during revolution  contributes to modify individual or collective personalities.  In  particular I will mention hatred, fear, ambition, jealousy or  envy, vanity, and enthusiasm.  We observe their influence during  several of the upheavals of history, notably during the course of  the French Revolution, which will furnish us with most of our  examples.    Hatred.--The hatred of persons, institutions, and things which  animated the men of the Revolution is one of these affective  phenomena which are the more striking the more one studies their  psychology.  They detested, not only their enemies, but the  members of their own party.  ``If one were to accept  unreservedly,'' said a recent writer, ``the judgments which they  expressed of one another, we should have to conclude that they  were all traitors and boasters, all incapable and corrupt,  all assassins or tyrants.''  We know with what hatred, scarcely  appeased by the death of their enemies, men persecuted the  Girondists, Dantonists, Hebertists, Robespierrists, &c.    One of the chief causes of this feeling resided in the fact that  these furious sectaries, being apostles in possession of the  absolute verity, were unable, like all believers, to tolerate the  sight of infidels.  A mystic or sentimental certitude is always  accompanied by the need of forcing itself on others, is never  convinced, and does not shrink from wholesale slaughter when it  has the power to commit it.    If the hatreds that divided the men of the Revolution had been of  rational origin they would not have lasted long, but, arising  from affective and mystic factors, men could neither forget nor  forgive.  Their sources being identical in the different parties,  they manifested themselves on every hand with identical violence.    It has been proved, by means of documents, that the Girondists  were no less"]]]
