So, poised  like a sparrow on a twig, she continued to peer over the edge of the  mantel-piece, where she saw quite enough to set her thinking.    Her master and mistress were a source of constant study to her. Late  in the evening, when he sat on a broad, low chair before the fire,  and she on the floor resting her head against his knees, the little  shepherdess's eyes fairly glowed with concentrated attention. \"So  that must be love,\" she thought, as she made a note of something  indefinable that quivered on their lips, or trembled on their eyelids  and made them droop. \"I wonder how they feel! I wish I knew!\" She was  watching her mistress with peculiar interest one night, when she saw  her slip her hand into her husband's coat-pocket, and draw out an  envelope with no stamp upon it. This she held for a second or two,  undecided as to whether she would read its contents. She looked up  inquiringly at her husband, then with a quick movement thrust it back  unopened, and laughingly threw her arms about his neck to drive away  the unpleasant impression. \"That is a grave mistake,\" thought the  little shepherdess. \"Why should there be anything that he should not  want her to know? As a principle, it is wrong. It is because people  build their love on illusions that they fear revelations. Why are  they so cowardly? I do not believe the truth to be as black as it is  painted. We should love, knowing,--that is the way. There must be  such a thing. Oh, when I love--\" and her eyes grew misty at the very  thought, and the lace on her little bodice rose and fell.    The days came and went, and found her growing ever more dainty, and  more thoughtful too. At last she opened her blue eyes, one Christmas  Eve, upon what struck her at first as something alarming. It was  midnight; and a stealthy sound of creaking boots awoke her from her  first sleep and in the very midst of a wonderful dream. Her little  heart was beating very fast. At first she thought it might be a  burglar who had heard of her cleverness and her philosophies, and  who had broken into the house to steal her away, but in a second a  match was struck and she understood her mistake. Her master stood  before her in the middle of the room. She saw him tiptoe to the  door, close it tightly, then stand listening for a moment before  lighting the gas. What could he be so mysterious about? She rubbed  her eyes and watched him attentively. She soon discovered that he  held a bundle under his arm, and she smiled to herself knowingly.  \"A Christmas present,\" she said; and she leaned so far forward that  she almost tipped off the mantel-piece. Her master sat down, laid  the package on his lap, and cut the strings with his penknife;  then he removed the wrappings as noiselessly as possible. Though  the little shepherdess had entirely recovered from her alarm, she  began to experience a sensation entirely new to her. She felt as  though there were a tight band around her waist that kept her  from breathing freely. Her head grew hollow; and a sickened sense  of misery--physical and mental anguishes writhing and knotting  themselves in the pit of her stomach--made her feel strangely faint.  What could this mean? Was it a foreboding? When the last wrapping was  carefully laid aside, she opened her eyes with a great effort and  looked upon the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. On the little  table directly opposite her, stood a figure about eight inches  high,--exquisite, dazzling! \"A prince!\" she thought at first; for he  was richly dressed, had a noble air, and on his short dark curls he  wore a crown. But no; he was not a prince.    As she looked at him again she realized that his crown was made of  laurels; then she saw too that he held a violin in his hand. He was  something greater than a prince; he was an artist. The master stood  off and looked at him with beaming joy, and the little shepherdess  felt her admiration increase with corroboration. Then he drew from  his pocket a pink wax taper, which he fitted into the laurel crown.  When it was lighted it shed a soft radiance. \"What a beautiful idea!\"  thought the shepherdess; \"that is the halo of art, glorifying,  transfiguring everything.\" The master then blew out the light, and  smiling complacently, reached up to the chandelier. Just as he was  about to turn out the gas, the little artist looked up and saw  the shepherdess,--one long look of surprise and eagerness; their  glances met, and in that look they understood each other. Through  the darkness of that whole night he played her beautiful strains  of dreamy music that opened to her visions of blue skies and balmy  orange groves; for he came from Italy, where the very air must be  heavy with poetry and love, she thought. He told her wonderful tales  with his violin. He alternately flooded her mind with moonlight and  fairies, or peopled her fancy with vague forms of sorrow that filled  her little breast with sobs. What a rapturous night that was! A  bewitched moonbeam that peered in through a broken slat in the blind  lay there entranced. In the pauses of the music the plaster wings of  the little Psyche quivered audibly. As for the shepherdess, something  had permeated her soul like a subtile essence, and opened one by one  great vistas of feeling of which she had never dreamed even in the  boldest flights of her imaginings. All her senses seemed suddenly to  have grown exquisitely acute. \"What a bursting heart there must be  behind it all!\" she thought. \"What a fund of sentiment! What must  he feel who, with a stroke of his bow, can change the aspect of the  world! It is he! It is he at last!\"    Christmas morning dawned upon the world. The first rays of light  that penetrated into the drawing-room brought with them the muffled  sound of carriages hurrying over the snow, and the occasional shout  of a belated reveller mingling with the faint murmur from groups of  early church-goers. But what was this to the little shepherdess? The  day that had dawned for her was more momentous than Christmas. She  was almost surprised to find that it was not a dream. No, there he  stood; and he smiled at her with the eager smile of those who meet  again after a separation.    \"You look as though you were about to take flight, you beautiful,  blue-eyed thing. Fly down to me. I will catch you in my arms,\" he  said, at which the little shepherdess blushed crimson. \"Perhaps you  do not love me now that you see me in the light of day.\"    She was just about to answer something very clever about not fearing  revelations because she had all her life scorned illusions, when the  door suddenly opened, and her master entered on tiptoe. He walked  over to the table, stood looking at his purchase with satisfaction  for a few seconds; then taking it up in his hand, he discovered  that the pink taper did not fit tightly enough into the little  laurel crown. In moving the figure, it was apt to topple first to  one side, then another. So he stood it down, and twisting the upper  part carefully, he screwed it off, crown and taper, from the pretty  head, and carried them both into the next room. During this incident  a thought flashed through the little shepherdess's mind, and like  a flash too she determined to execute it. She pulled her left foot  with a jerk, and gave a little tug at her gown, and there she stood  on the edge of the mantel-piece, free. She threw a hasty glance at  the little shepherd, who looked on with a parched throat; it is even  possible that she smiled a kindly smile upon the black clock. Then  she gathered her skirts with both hands and jumped down. It was a  supreme moment. The lovers stood looking into each other's eyes.    \"My precious one,\" he said, \"you are mine at last. I have waited for  you through the ages, and you have come!\"    And the little shepherdess, stepping up on a book, held her wreath of  corn-flowers over his head.    \"I have no laurels to bring you,\" she said, \"but I will crown you  with my trusting love.\" And she rose on her tiptoes and leaned  forward to lay her corn-flowers on his brow. But what was it? Why did  she start, and then lean farther forward and look again? What could  she have seen to make her eyes grow suddenly dim,--those clear eyes  that meant to see everything?    The fact of it was that under the laurels it was all hollow, hollow  down to his belt. Where his heart should have been, she saw a little  dust that exhaled a musty odor, and the wings of several dead flies.  Her brain reeled. Was this all, then? And the music, where had  the wonderful music come from, or was the music all? This was the  shepherdess's last speculation. She felt the book sinking beneath  her little feet; she grasped her crook nervously; then there was a  blank in her thoughts; she tottered, and crash! she fell and broke  into a thousand pieces at the feet of her lover. At first he felt  that he would die too. Then he composed himself, and when he came  to understand how it had all happened, he shrugged his shoulders.  \"Women are all alike,\" said he. \"They fancy they are thinking when  they are only brooding. They want to be analytical, and they are only  cavilous.\" And he tuned his violin, while his eyes rested on the  little plaster Psyche.    [Illustration]          THE THREE LOW MASSES.

I ought to know something about it, considering I helped stuff them  myself. I thought their skins would crack while they were roasting,  they were stretched so tight--\"    \"Merciful Saints! And I'm so fond of truffles too! Hurry there,  Garrigou, hand me my surplice. And what else did you see in the  kitchen besides the turkeys?\"    \"Oh, all sorts of good things.

You see what I am when I let out; am I not right to keep both bit  and bridle on my imagination? Now I must leave you, as I have some  business to attend--rather an unusual thing for me. I'll trot you out  to-morrow, or any time you like, but I think I have put you on the best  track for the present.\"    \"Thanks to your judicious guidance; yes, I have enjoyed the ramble I  assure you.\"    \"Well,\" resumed he, \"in disavowal of fashion and petrifaction, will you  drink tea with Mrs. Winter and myself at half-past six this evening.  I'll make the Vernons come. I have lived so much on the Continent that  I cannot get into the absurdity of fashionable English dinner hours,  but take mine when my stomach cries cupboard, which is generally at two  o'clock.\"    \"I shall be most happy,\" said I.    \"Well, good morning, be diligent; by the way look in early, shew me the  result of your labours, and take a peep at my studio.\"    \"A thousand thanks, yes.\"    It was still early, too early I thought for a visit to the Priory  House, so arming myself with sketch book and pencil, I returned to an  old tumble down carriers' inn, which had struck my eye while rambling  with Winter, and commenced transferring it to paper; while my mind  was filled with another picture, that drawn by Winter, of the lonely  deformed organist and the angelic kindness of Kate Vernon.    \"What a fate!\" I exclaimed aloud; but with the sounds of my own voice,  came the recollection of the peculiarly peaceful expression of his  face! There was no misery of look, none of that restlessness which  the perpetual mortification of such a life might well be expected to  produce. \"No, he is happy! happier perhaps than I am, with youth and  health and this straight strong frame, and my rightful place among  the nobles of the land; and wealth--_halte la!_ have I wealth? Yes,  compared with him, but by no means sufficient to marry. Then I never  dreamt of marrying. No! I have every thing, and this poor fellow  nothing, and yet, would he change with me? By Jove, I'd take the long  odds he has not a dunning tailor; that's an item in my 'haves,' and his  'has nots,' I forgot to enumerate; but its must now be time to call on  Kate.        \"To greet the heart that yearns for thee.\"    I cannot get that air out of my head.\"    The sun, which had all the morning been obscured by heavy clouds, shone  out with the brilliancy and warmth of June rather than September. As  I entered the little garden before Colonel Vernon's cottage I paused  a moment in the vain endeavour to decipher the inscription over the  gateway; a B, a C, and a very faint D were all I could make out.    \"The masther's out, but Miss Kate's within, Sir,\" was Nurse's reply to  my queries.    \"And I hope you are quite well yourself, Mrs. O'Toole,\" said I, in a  state of beatitude.    \"Indeed, an' I am, sir, glory be to God,\" and she opened the door,  saying familiarly, \"here's the Captin, Miss Kate.\"    Miss Vernon was seated at a writing table in the window, copying out  of the large dusky book the organist had given her. The window was  open, and the light breeze gently stirred the white muslin curtains,  and brought a thousand delicious odours from the garden and fields;  while beyond it river and rocks, and swelling upland and woods, and the  distant spire of a village church, lay bathed in a flood of glowing  golden light, which seemed to endue every object with beauty by the  sole agency of colour.    Kate rose to receive me with her sparkling smile, dispelling the gentle  gravity which always characterised her countenance when in repose, and  made it so strangely different according as her mood changed.    \"Then you have missed grandpapa,\" said she, giving me her hand, \"I told  him I thought you would be out from what I heard you say to Mr. Winter  last night.\"    A quick impulse of vanity suggested--\"could she have remained at home  in expectation of my advent?\" but a glance at her bonnet and shawl, as  if just thrown off, and the slight disorder in the rich masses of her  hair, completed my conviction that she had but just come in.    \"How sorry I am to have missed Colonel Vernon,\" said I, hypocritically;  \"I have been all the morning rambling about with your friend Mr.  Winter, and have to thank you for introducing me to so admirable a  guide.\"    \"I knew you would like him; but sit down, I am sure grandpapa will  return soon. I see he did not intend to go farther than your Hotel, or  he would have taken Cormac.\"    And she pointed to the grave old hound, who lay stretched in the  sunshine before the window and had partly risen on my appearance.    I drew a chair opposite Miss Vernon, who resumed her occupation.    \"I am writing out the parts of some chants separately,\" said she, \"not  a very absorbing employment; Mr. Gilpin wishes his choir to get them  up, and I volunteered my services.\"    \"Rather troublesome,\" said I, absently.    \"Oh no,\" said she, \"I have nothing particular to do just now, and it is  so dull to be idle.\"    \"I fancy A----, delightful as it is in our antiquarian or picturesque  point of view, must be rather too tranquil a sojourn for so  accomplished a valseuse as yourself.\"    \"I should have quite as little society anywhere else, and not half so  many real _agrémens_; I never find it dull.\"    \"How does the Colonel amuse himself?\"    \"Ah!\" cried Miss Vernon with great earnestness, \"I often think of  that; it is such a change for him; such a total break-up of all his  accustomed ways. I am often at my wits end to amuse him, yet he bears  it wonderfully; how do you think him looking?\"    \"Wonderfully well! never better, but in this sweet place with you he  cannot be unhappy.\"    \"God forbid he should--a little sad sometimes.\"    She was silent for a few moments, and then resumed her pen. I cannot  describe how charming this visit was to me. Miss Vernon's little white  hand wrote on busily all the time, while sometimes glancing up at me,  but generally looking at her work. I felt none of the _gêne_ of a  formal _tête à tête_, where the visitor and visited sit both upright,  compelled to stare at each other; but leaning back in my chair, I  talked and gazed at my ease.    \"I can hardly believe the evidence of my senses that I am in calm  conversation with the _incognita_ who so puzzled me,\" I resumed after a  pause.    \"Yes, it is very curious, but still more so that the discovery of our  mutual acquaintance with Lady Desmond led to no _dénouement_,\" said my  companion.    \"I knew her no further than meeting her frequently in society in  Dublin, where I was about four years ago, with a cousin of mine, who  was on the staff.\"    \"She is a second cousin of grandpapa's, and I was a good deal with her  just before we came here: not long, I fancy, after you had known her;  and knowing how general her parties and invitations were, I really  at one time imagined I might have met you at some of them: I little  thought what a much older acquaintance I was dancing with.\"    \"She is a handsome woman,\" I observed, \"and, I fancy, not unlike  Colonel Vernon.\"    \"How brilliant and how kind she is,\" she exclaimed, \"I often wonder the  hurried life she leads gives her space to breathe! I doubt if she has  time to be happy.\"    \"Happy! Miss Vernon: do you think happiness is to be found in the  stagnation that some dignify with the name of tranquillity? My  least distinct idea of happiness is the hopeful exertion of every  faculty--mental and physical--in search of what we never find; but  inaction is misery.\"    \"There is some truth in what you say,\" replied she, \"but all my  ideas of happiness here and hereafter, are concentrated in the word  'peace!'\"--and she paused, and gazed out into the sunshine with such  an expression of calm,--of harmony, if I may so term it--that I felt  tempted to ask her what spell had stilled her heart into such deep  repose.    \"Did you make any sketches this morning?\" she asked, rousing herself  from her thoughts.    \"One or two rough outlines; but I think I could make a very good  picture from this spot,\" said I, rising to look through the window.    \"Then,\" said Miss Vernon eagerly, \"pray, pray do, Captain Egerton, and  give it to me; it will be an inexpressible pleasure to me to have some  memento of this quiet, happy spot, when I am, perhaps, far away.\"    \"I will set about it to-morrow; but have you any notion of leaving  A----?\" I asked.    \"Oh no,--I only spoke from a presentiment I often feel, that we will  not always rest calmly in this quiet nook; the waters of life will  rise some day, and sweep us out again into the noise and tumult of the  world!\"    Here the old dog, disturbed by my movement, slowly raised himself, and  entering by the window, laid his large stern head, with a sort of sigh,  on his mistress's arm.    \"Ah, Cormac, good old friend,\" said she, putting her arm caressingly  round him, \"no tumult, however rough, shall separate us; you and I,  and grandpapa, and nurse, a goodly company, _n'est ce pas?_\"--    \"Captain Egerton,\" said she, rallying and laughing, \"don't quiz my  presentiments, but sketch me this scene.\"    \"With the greatest pleasure; and now I remember, I have some old  drawings of Dungar somewhere: I'll look out for them, and bring them  over here the next time I come.\"    \"Oh thanks, a thousand hearty thanks: they will be treasures"]]]
