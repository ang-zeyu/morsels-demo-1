These bats are chiefly insect-eaters, though included among them  are the vampire bats and the Megaderma lyra which have the reputation  of being cannibalistic. The various families are \"The Horseshoe Bats,\"  \"The NycteridA|,\" \"The VespertilionidA|,\" \"The EmballonuridA|,\" and \"The  PhyllostomidA|.      The Common English Bats.    The common English bats belong to the VespertilionidA|. The Pipistrelle  feeds upon insects but will eat flesh if opportunity serves. In his  \"Natural History of Selbourne,\" Mr. White describes a tame bat which he  saw, which would take flies out of a person's hand. \"If you gave it  anything to eat,\" he says, \"it brought its wings round before the mouth,  hovering and hiding its head in the manner of birds of prey when they  feed. The adroitness it showed in shearing off the wings of the flies,  which were always rejected, pleased me much. Insects seemed to be most  acceptable, though it did not refuse raw flesh when offered; so that the  notion that bats go down chimneys and gnaw men's bacon seems no  improbable story.\" The Long-eared Bat, _Plecotus auritus_, is also  common in England. \"Its ears,\" says Mr. Wood, \"are about an inch and a  half in length and have a fold in them reaching almost to the lips,\"  hence its name. \"It is very easily tamed.\"      The Vampire Bat.    The Vampire Bat which belongs to South America has been invested with a  halo of romance by the stories which have been told about its sanguinary  character. \"It lives,\" says the Rev. J. G. Wood, \"on the blood of  animals, and sucks usually while its victim sleeps. The extremities,  where the blood flows freely, as the toe of a man, the ears of a horse,  or the combs and wattles of fowls, are its favourite spots. When it has  selected a subject, on which it intends to feed, it watches until the  animal is fairly asleep. It then carefully fans its victim with its  wings while it bites a little hole in the ear or shoulder, and through  this small aperture, into which a pin's head would scarcely pass, it  contrives to abstract sufficient blood to make a very ample meal. The  wound is so small, and the bat manages so adroitly, that the victim  does not discover that anything has happened until the morning, when a  pool of blood betrays the visit of the vampire. \"The Vampire Bat,\" says  Professor Darwin, \"is often the cause of much trouble by biting the  horses on their withers. The injury is not so much owing to the loss of  blood, as to the inflammation which the pressure of the saddle  afterwards produces. The whole circumstance has lately been doubted in  England. I was therefore fortunate in being present when one was  actually caught on a horse's back. We were bivouacking late one evening,  near Coquimbo, in Chili, when my servant, noticing that one of the  horses was very restive, went to see what was the matter, and fancying  he could distinguish something, suddenly put his hand on the beast's  withers, and secured the vampire. In the morning the spot where the bite  had been inflicted was easily distinguished by its being slightly  swollen and bloody. The third day afterwards we rode the horse without  any ill effects.\"      A Traveller's Experience.    Captain Steadman, in his \"Narrative of a Five Years' Expedition against  the Revolted Negroes of Surinam,\" relates, that on waking about four  o'clock one morning in his hammock, he was extremely alarmed at finding  himself weltering in congealed blood, and without feeling any pain  whatever. \"The mystery was,\" continues Captain Steadman, \"that I had  been bitten by the _Vampyre_ or _Spectre_ of Guiana, which is also  called the _Flying Dog_ of New Spain, and by the Spaniards,  _Perrovolador_. This is no other than a bat of monstrous size, that  sucks the blood from men and cattle while they are fast asleep, even  sometimes till they die; and as the manner in which they proceed is  truly wonderful, I shall endeavour to give a distinct account of it.  Knowing, by instinct, that the person they intend to attack is in a  sound slumber, they generally alight near the feet, where, while the  creature continues fanning with his enormous wings, which keeps one  cool, he bites a piece out of the tip of the great toe, so very small,  indeed, that the head of a pin could scarcely be received into the  wound, which is consequently not painful; yet through this orifice he  continues to suck the blood until he is obliged to disgorge. Cattle they  generally bite in the ear, but always in places where the blood flows  spontaneously.\"      Megaderma Lyra.    The Vampire Bat of South America has long been credited with  sanguinivorous habits, and until recently was supposed to be the only  bat having such propensities. Mr. Edward Blyth has, however, shown that  the Megaderma Lyra of Asia will sometimes prey upon the smaller species  of bat with which it comes in contact. Mr. Blyth, one evening, observed  a rather large bat of this species enter an outhouse, whereupon he  procured a light, closed the door to prevent escape and then proceeded  to catch the intruder. In the chase the bat dropped what Mr. Blyth at  first took to be a young one, but which proved to be a small Vespertilio  Bat, \"feeble from loss of blood, which it was evident the Megaderma had  been sucking from a large, and still bleeding, wound under and behind  the ear.\" As the Megaderma had not alighted while in the outhouse, Mr.  Blyth concluded \"that it sucked the vital current from its victim as it  flew, having probably seized it on the wing, and that it was seeking a  quiet nook where it might devour the body at leisure.\" Having caught the  Megaderma Mr. Blyth kept both specimens until the next day, and having  examined each separately put them both into a cage, whereupon the  Megaderma attacked the smaller bat \"with the ferocity of a tiger\";  finding it impossible to escape the cage \"it hung by the hind legs to  one side of its prison, and after sucking the victim till no more blood  was left commenced devouring it, and soon left nothing but the head and  some portions of the limbs.\" \"The voidings observed shortly afterwards  in its cage,\" says Mr. Blyth, \"resembled clotted blood, which will  explain the statement of Steadman and others concerning masses of  congealed blood being observed near a patient who has been attacked by a  South American vampire.\"      ORDER III.    Insect-Eating Animals.    Insect-eating animals (_Insectivora_) include several families, of which  the hedgehogs, the moles and the shrews, are the best known genera. The  Colugo is perhaps the most singular member of the order. According to  some writers his proper place is among the lemurs, and except that his  feet are adorned with claws instead of nails, it is easy to understand  why he might be classed with the quadrumana. The Colugo is covered from  head to foot by a furry membrane, resembling an overcoat open in front  and ending in a three cornered flap at the tail.      The Hedgehog.    The family of the hedgehog contains two genera and a number of species.  Its length is from six to ten inches; the head, back, and sides being  covered with short spines, the under parts with soft hair. It lives in  thickets, and subsists on fruits, roots, and insects. During the winter,  it lies imbedded in moss, or dried leaves, in a state of torpidity. It  inhabits Europe, Asia and Africa. It is valuable in the garden for  destroying the insects, and in the kitchen for the extermination of  cockroaches, beetles and other household pests. For defence, it rolls  itself into a ball in such a manner as to present its prickly spines on  all sides. In this condition it can suffer considerable violence without  injury. Mr. Bell mentions a hedgehog that was in the habit of running to  the edge of an area wall twelve or fourteen feet high, and without a  moment's pause, leap over, contracting into a ball as he fell, and in  this form reaching the ground, where it quietly unfolded itself as if  nothing had happened and ran on its way. It is nocturnal in its habits  and in its natural state lives in pairs. It is easily tamed. A hedgehog  has been trained to serve as a turnspit \"as well,\" says Captain Brown,  \"in all respects as the dog of that denomination. In a wild state it  has been known to attack and kill a leveret. In attacking a snake it  will roll itself up between its bites and thus protect itself against  retaliation.      The Mole.    The family of the TalpidA| to which the mole belongs is a large and  interesting one. The common mole \"when at rest,\" says the author of  \"Tales of Animals,\" \"bears more resemblance to a small stuffed sack than  to a living animal, its head being entirely destitute of external ears,  and elongated nearly to a point, and its eyes so extremely small and  completely hidden by the fur, that it would not be surprising should a  casual observer conclude it to be blind. This apparently shapeless mass  is endowed with great activity and a surprising degree of strength, and  is excellently suited for deriving enjoyment from the peculiar life it  is designed to lead. It is found abundantly in Europe and North America,  from Canada to Virginia; often living at no great distance from  water-courses, or in dykes thrown up to protect meadows from inundation.  The mole burrows with great quickness, and travels under ground with  much celerity; nothing can be better constructed for this purpose than  its broad and strong hands, or fore paws, armed with long and powerful  claws, which are very sharp at their extremities, and slightly curved on  the inside. Numerous galleries, communicating with each other, enable  the mole to travel in various directions, without coming to the surface,  which they appear to do very rarely, unless their progress is impeded by  a piece of ground so hard as to defy their strength and perseverance.  The depth of their burrows depends very materially on the character of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#11)"],[1," soul its fear subdues.' I don't do that.  We can't gloss it over, Rilla. I'm a coward.\"    \"You're not. Think of how you fought Dan Reese long ago.\"    \"One spurt of courage isn't enough for a lifetime.\"    \"Walter, one time I heard father say that the trouble with you was a  sensitive nature and a vivid imagination. You feel things before they  really come--feel them all alone when there isn't anything to help you  bear them--to take away from them. It isn't anything to be ashamed of.  When you and Jem got your hands burned when the grass was fired on the  sand-hills two years ago Jem made twice the fuss over the pain that you  did. As for this horrid old war, there'll be plenty to go without you.  It won't last long.\"    \"I wish I could believe it. Well, it's supper-time, Rilla. You'd better  run. I don't want anything.\"    \"Neither do I. I couldn't eat a mouthful. Let me stay here with you,  Walter. It's such a comfort to talk things over with someone. The rest  all think that I'm too much of a baby to understand.\"    So they two sat there in the old valley until the evening star shone  through a pale-grey, gauzy cloud over the maple grove, and a fragrant  dewy darkness filled their little sylvan dell. It was one of the  evenings Rilla was to treasure in remembrance all her life--the first  one on which Walter had ever talked to her as if she were a woman and  not a child. They comforted and strengthened each other. Walter felt,  for the time being at least, that it was not such a despicable thing  after all to dread the horror of war; and Rilla was glad to be made the  confidante of his struggles--to sympathize with and encourage him. She  was of importance to somebody.    When they went back to Ingleside they found callers sitting on the  veranda. Mr. and Mrs. Meredith had come over from the manse, and Mr.  and Mrs. Norman Douglas had come up from the farm. Cousin Sophia was  there also, sitting with Susan in the shadowy background. Mrs. Blythe  and Nan and Di were away, but Dr. Blythe was home and so was Dr.  Jekyll, sitting in golden majesty on the top step. And of course they  were all talking of the war, except Dr. Jekyll who kept his own counsel  and looked contempt as only a cat can. When two people foregathered in  those days they talked of the war; and old Highland Sandy of the  Harbour Head talked of it when he was alone and hurled anathemas at the  Kaiser across all the acres of his farm. Walter slipped away, not  caring to see or be seen, but Rilla sat down on the steps, where the  garden mint was dewy and pungent. It was a very calm evening with a  dim, golden afterlight irradiating the glen. She felt happier than at  any time in the dreadful week that had passed. She was no longer  haunted by the fear that Walter would go.    \"I'd go myself if I was twenty years younger,\" Norman Douglas was  shouting. Norman always shouted when he was excited. \"I'd show the  Kaiser a thing or two! Did I ever say there wasn't a hell? Of course  there's a hell--dozens of hells--hundreds of hells--where the Kaiser  and all his brood are bound for.\"    \"I knew this war was coming,\" said Mrs. Norman triumphantly. \"I saw it  coming right along. I could have told all those stupid Englishmen what  was ahead of them. I told you, John Meredith, years ago what the Kaiser  was up to but you wouldn't believe it. You said he would never plunge  the world in war. Who was right about the Kaiser, John? You--or I? Tell  me that.\"    \"You were, I admit,\" said Mr. Meredith.    \"It's too late to admit it now,\" said Mrs. Norman, shaking her head, as  if to intimate that if John Meredith had admitted it sooner there might  have been no war.    \"Thank God, England's navy is ready,\" said the doctor.    \"Amen to that,\" nodded Mrs. Norman. \"Bat-blind as most of them were  somebody had foresight enough to see to that.\"    \"Maybe England'll manage not to get into trouble over it,\" said Cousin  Sophia plaintively. \"I dunno. But I'm much afraid.\"    \"One would suppose that England was in trouble over it already, up to  her neck, Sophia Crawford,\" said Susan. \"But your ways of thinking are  beyond me and always were. It is my opinion that the British Navy will  settle Germany in a jiffy and that we are all getting worked up over  nothing.\"    Susan spat out the words as if she wanted to convince herself more than  anybody else. She had her little store of homely philosophies to guide  her through life, but she had nothing to buckler her against the  thunderbolts of the week that had just passed. What had an honest,  hard-working, Presbyterian old maid of Glen St. Mary to do with a war  thousands of miles away? Susan felt that it was indecent that she  should have to be disturbed by it.    \"The British army will settle Germany,\" shouted Norman. \"Just wait till  it gets into line and the Kaiser will find that real war is a different  thing from parading round Berlin with your moustaches cocked up.\"    \"Britain hasn't got an army,\" said Mrs. Norman emphatically. \"You  needn't glare at me, Norman. Glaring won't make soldiers out of timothy  stalks. A hundred thousand men will just be a mouthful for Germany's  millions.\"    \"There'll be some tough chewing in the mouthful, I reckon,\" persisted  Norman valiantly. \"Germany'll break her teeth on it. Don't you tell me  one Britisher isn't a match for ten foreigners. I could polish off a  dozen of 'em myself with both hands tied behind my back!\"    \"I am told,\" said Susan, \"that old Mr. Pryor does not believe in this  war. I am told that he says England went into it just because she was  jealous of Germany and that she did not really care in the least what  happened to Belgium.\"    \"I believe he's been talking some such rot,\" said Norman. \"I haven't  heard him. When I do, Whiskers-on-the-moon won't know what happened to  him. That precious relative of mine, Kitty Alec, holds forth to the  same effect, I understand. Not before me, though--somehow, folks don't  indulge in that kind of conversation in my presence. Lord love you,  they've a kind of presentiment, so to speak, that it wouldn't be  healthy for their complaint.\"    \"I am much afraid that this war has been sent as a punishment for our  sins,\" said Cousin Sophia, unclasping her pale hands from her lap and  reclasping them solemnly over her stomach. \"'The world is very  evil--the times are waxing late.'\"    \"Parson here's got something of the same idea,\" chuckled Norman.  \"Haven't you, Parson? That's why you preached t'other night on the text  'Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.' I didn't  agree with you--wanted to get up in the pew and shout out that there  wasn't a word of sense in what you were saying, but Ellen, here, she  held me down. I never have any fun sassing parsons since I got married.\"    \"Without shedding of blood there is no anything,\" said Mr. Meredith, in  the gentle dreamy way which had an unexpected trick of convincing his  hearers. \"Everything, it seems to me, has to be purchased by  self-sacrifice. Our race has marked every step of its painful ascent  with blood. And now torrents of it must flow again. No, Mrs. Crawford,  I don't think the war has been sent as a punishment for sin. I think it  is the price humanity must pay for some blessing--some advance great  enough to be worth the price--which we may not live to see but which  our children's children will inherit.\"    \"If Jerry is killed will you feel so fine about it?\" demanded Norman,  who had been saying things like that all his life and never could be  made to see any reason why he shouldn't. \"Now, never mind kicking me in  the shins, Ellen. I want to see if Parson meant what he said or if it  was just a pulpit frill.\"    Mr. Meredith's face quivered. He had had a terrible hour alone in his  study on the night Jem and Jerry had gone to town. But he answered  quietly.    \"Whatever I felt, it could not alter my belief--my assurance that a  country whose sons are ready to lay down their lives in her defence  will win a new vision because of their sacrifice.\"    \"You do mean it, Parson. I can always tell when people mean what they  say. It's a gift that was born in me. Makes me a terror to most  parsons, that! But I've never caught you yet saying anything you didn't  mean. I'm always hoping I will--that's what reconciles me to going to  church. It'd be such a comfort to me--such a weapon to batter Ellen  here with when she tries to civilize me. Well, I'm off over the road to  see Ab. Crawford a minute. The gods be good to you all.\"    \"The old pagan!\" muttered Susan, as Norman strode away. She did not  care if Ellen Douglas did hear her. Susan could never understand why  fire did not descend from heaven upon Norman Douglas when he insulted  ministers the way he did. But the astonishing thing was Mr. Meredith  seemed really to like his brother-in-law.    Rilla wished they would talk of something besides war. She had heard  nothing else for a week and she was really a little tired of it. Now  that she was relieved from her haunting fear that Walter would want to  go it made her quite impatient. But she supposed--with a sigh--that  there would be three or four months of it yet.        CHAPTER VI    SUSAN, RILLA, AND DOG MONDAY MAKE A RESOLUTION    The big living-room at Ingleside was snowed over with drifts of white  cotton. Word had come from Red Cross headquarters that sheets and  bandages would be required. Nan and Di and Rilla were hard at work.  Mrs. Blythe and Susan were upstairs in the boys' room, engaged in a  more personal task. With dry, anguished eyes they were packing up Jem's  belongings. He must leave for Valcartier the next morning. They had  been expecting the word but it was none the less dreadful when it came.    Rilla was basting the hem of a sheet for the first time in her life.  When the word had come that Jem must go she had her cry out among the  pines in Rainbow Valley and then she had gone to her mother.    \"Mother, I want"]]]
