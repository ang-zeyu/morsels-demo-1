Such a commander they found in Napoleon. They were more  than willing to confer upon him all the power he could desire. \"You  know what is best for us;\"\" said the people of Napoleon. \"Direct  us what to do, and we will do it.\" It was thus that absolute power  came voluntarily into his hands. Under the circumstances it was  so natural that it can excite no suspicion. He was called First  Consul. But he already swayed a scepter more mighty than that of the  Caesars. But sixteen months had now elapsed since Napoleon landed  at Frejus. In that time he had attained the throne of France. He had  caused order and prosperity to emerge from the chaos of revolution. By  his magnanimity he had disarmed Russia, by his armies had humbled  Austria, and had compelled continental Europe to accept an honorable  peace. He merited the gratitude of his countrymen, and he received  it in overflowing measure. Through all these incidents, so eventful  and so full of difficulty, it is not easy to point to a single act  of Napoleon, which indicates a malicious or an ungenerous spirit.    \"I fear nothing,\" said Napoleon at St. Helena, \"for my renown.  Posterity will do me justice. It will compare the good which I  have done with faults which I have committed. If I had succeeded  I should have died with the reputation of being the greatest man  who ever existed. From being nothing I became, by my own exertions,  the most powerful monarch of the universe, without committing  any crime. My ambition was great, but it rested on the opinion of  the masses. I have always thought that sovereignty resides in the  people. The empire, as I had organized it, was but a great republic.  Called to the throne by the voice of the people, my maxim has always  been a career open to talent without distinction of birth . It is  for this system of equality that the European oligarchy detests  me. And yet in England talent and great services raise a man to  the highest rank. England should have understood me.\"    The French Revolution,\" said Napoleon, \"was a general movement of  the mass of the nation against the privileged classes. The nobles  were exempt from the burdens of the state, and yet exclusively  occupied all the posts of honor and emolument. The revolution  destroyed these exclusive privileges, and established equality of  rights. All the avenues of wealth and greatness were equally open  to every citizen, according to his talents. The French nation  established the imperial throne, and placed me upon it. The throne  of France was granted before to Hugh Capet, by a few bishops and  nobles. The imperial throne was given to me, by the desire of the  people.\"    Joseph Bonaparte was of very essential service to Napoleon in the  diplomatic intercourse of the times. Lucien also was employed in  various ways, and the whole family were taken under the protection  of the First Consul. At St. Helena Napoleon uttered the following  graphic and truthful eulogium upon his brothers and sisters: \"What  family, in similar circumstances, would have acted better? Every  one is not qualified to be a statesman. That requires a combination  of powers which does not often fall to the lot of any one. In this  respect all my brothers were singularly situated; they possessed  at once too much and too little talent. They felt themselves too  strong to resign themselves. blindly to a guiding counselor, and  yet too weak to be left entirely to themselves. But take them all  in all I have certainly good reason to be proud of my family. Joseph  would have been an honor to society in any country, and Lucien  would have been an honor to any assembly; Jerome, as he advanced  in life, would have developed every qualification requisite  in a sovereign. Louis would have been distinguished in any rank  or condition of life. My sister Eliza was endowed with masculine  powers of mind; she must have proved herself a philosopher in her  adverse fortune. Caroline possessed great talents and capacity.  Pauline, perhaps the most beautiful woman of her age, has been and  will continue to the end of her life, the most amiable creature in  the world. As to my mother, she deserves all kinds of veneration.  How seldom is so numerous a family entitled to so much praise. Add  to this, that, setting aside the jarring of political opinions, we  sincerely loved each other. For my part, I never ceased to cherish  fraternal affection for them all. And I am convinced that in their  hearts they felt the same sentiments toward me, and that in case  of need, they would have given me every proof of it.\"    The proud old nobility, whom Napoleon had restored to France,  and upon many of whom he had conferred their confiscated estates,  manifested no gratitude toward their benefactor. They were sighting  for the re-enthronement of the Bourbons, and for the return of the  good old times, when all the offices of emolument and honor were  reserved for them and for their children, and the people were  but their hewers of wood and drawers of water. In the morning, as  beggars, they would crowd the audience-chamber of the First Consul  with their petitions. In the evening they disdained to honor his  levees with their presence. They spoke contemptuously of Josephine,  of her kindness and her desire to conciliate all parties. They  condemned every thing that Napoleon did. He, however, paid no heed  to their murmurings. He would not condescend even to punish them  by neglect. In that most lofty pride which induced him to say that,  in his administration he wished to imitate the elemency of God , he  endeavored to consult for the interests of all, both the evil and  the unthankful. His fame was to consist, not in revenging himself  upon his enemies, but in aggrandizing France.    At this time Napoleon's establishment at the Tuileries rather resembled  that of a very rich gentleman, than the court of a monarch. Junot,  one of his aids, was married to Mademoiselle Permon, the young  lady whose name will be remembered in connection with the anecdote  of \"Puss in Boots.\" Her mother was one of the most haughty of the  ancient nobility, who affected to look upon Napoleon with contempt  as not of royal blood. The evening after her marriage Madame Junot  was to be presented to Josephine. After the Opera she drove to the  Tuileries. It was near eleven o'clock. As Josephine had appointed  the hour, she was expected. Eugene, hearing the wheels of the carriage,  descended to the court-yard, presented his arm to Madame Junot,  and they entered the large saloon together. It was a magnificent  apartment, magnificently furnished. Two chandeliers, surrounded  with gauze to soften the glare, shed a subdued and grateful light  over the room. Josephine was seated before a tapestry-frame working  upon embroidery. Near her sat Hortense, sylph-like in figure,  and surpassingly gentle and graceful in her manners. Napoleon was  standing near Josephine, with his hands clasped behind him, engaged  in conversation with his wife and her lovely daughter. Upon the  entrance of Madame Junot Josephine immediately arose, took her  two hands, and, affectionately kissing her, said, \"I have too long  been Junot's friend, not to entertain the same sentiments for his  wife; particularly for the one he has chosen.\"    \"Oh, Josephine!\" said Napoleon, \"that is running on very fast.  How do you know that this little pickle is worth loving. Well,  Mademoiselle Loulou (you see that I do not forget the names of my  old friends), have you not a word for me!\" Saying this, he gently  took her hand and drew her toward him.    The young bride was much embarrassed, and yet she struggled to  retain her pride of birth. \"General!\" she replied, smiling, \"it is  not for me to speak first.\"    \"Very well parried,\" said Napoleon, playfully, \"the mother's spirit!  And how is Madame Permon?\"    \"Very ill, general! For two years her health has caused us great  uneasiness.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Napoleon,\" so bad as that? I am sorry to hear it;  very sorry. Make my regards to her. It is a wrong head, a proud  spirit, but she has a generous heart and a noble soul. I hope that we  shall often see you, Madame Junot. My intention is to draw around  me a numerous family, consisting of my generals and their young  wives. They will be of my wife and of Hortense, as their husbands  are my friends. But you must not expect to meet here your acquaintances  of the ancient nobility. I do not like them. They are my enemies,  and prove it by defaming.\"    This was but the morning twilight of that imperial splendor which  afterward dazzled the most powerful potentates of Europe. Hortense,  who subsequently became the wife of Louis Bonaparte, and the mother  of Louis Napoleon, who, at the moment of this present writing, is  at the head of the government of France, was then seventeen years  of age. \"She was,\" Madame Junot, \"fresh as a rose. Though her fair  complexion was not relieved by much color, she had enough to produce  that freshness and bloom which was her chief beauty. A profusion of  light hair played in silken locks around her soft and penetrating  blue eyes. The delicate roundness of her figure, slender as  a palm-tree, was set off by the elegant carriage of her head. But  that which formed the chief attraction of Hortense was the grace  and suavity of her manners, which united the Creole nonchalance  with the vivacity of France. She was gay, gentle, and amiable. She  had wit, which, without the smallest ill-temper, had just malice  enough to be amusing. A polished and well-conducted education had  improved her natural talents. She drew excellently, sang harmoniously,  and performed admirably in comedy. In 1800, she was a charming young  girl. She afterward became one of the most amiable princesses in  Europe. I have seen many, both in their own courts and in Paris,  but I have never "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#11)"],[1,"travelers passed over a succession of wild stretches of forest  or jungle, high above big grassy plains, over low but rugged  mountain ranges, and big rivers. Now and then they would cross some  lake, on the calm surface of which could be made out natives, in big  canoes, hollowed out from trees. In each case the blacks showed  every appearance of fright at the sight of the airship throbbing  along over their heads.    On passing over the lake, Ned Newton looked down and cried out  excitedly:    \"Look! Elephants! They're in swimming, and the natives are shooting  them! Now's our chance, Tom!\"    Mr. Anderson and Mr. Durban, after a quick glance, drew back  laughing.    \"Those are hippopotami!\" exclaimed the old elephant man. \"Good  hunting, if you don't care what you shoot, but not much sport in it.  It will be some time yet before we see any elephants, boys.\"    Ned was rather chagrined at his mistake, but the African travelers  told him that any one, not familiar with the country, would have  made it, especially in looking down from a great height.    They sailed along about half a mile above the earth, Tom gradually  increasing the speed of the ship, as he found the machinery to be  working well. Dinner was served as they were crossing a high grassy  plateau, over which could be seen bounding a number of antelopes.    \"Some of those would go good for a meal,\" said Mr. Durban, after a  pause during which he watched the graceful creatures.    \"Then we'll go down and get some for supper,\" decided Tom, for in  that hot climate it was impossible to carry fresh meat on the  airship.    Accordingly, the Black Hawk was sent down, and came to rest in a  natural clearing on the edge of the jungle. After waiting until the  fierce heat of noonday was over, the travelers got out their rifles  and, under the leadership of Mr. Durban and Mr. Anderson, who was  also an experienced hunter, they set off.    Game was plentiful, but as they could only eat a comparatively small  quantity, and as it would not keep, they only shot what they needed.  Tom had his electric rifle, but hesitated to use it, as Mr. Durban  and Mr. Anderson had each already bowled over a fine buck.    However, a chance came most unexpectedly, for, as they were passing  along the banks of a little stream, which was almost hidden from  view by thick weeds and rank grass, there was a sudden commotion in  the bushes, and a fierce wild buffalo sprang out at the party.    There are few animals in Africa more dreaded by hunters than the  wild buffalo, for the beast, with its spreading sharp horns is a  formidable foe, and will seldom give up the attack until utterly  unable to move. They are fierce and relentless.    \"Look out!\" yelled Mr. Durban. \"To cover, everybody! If that beast  gets after you it's no fun! You and I will fire at him, Mr. Anderson!\"    Mr. Durban raised his rifle, and pulled the trigger, but, for some  reason, the weapon failed to go off. Mr. Anderson quickly raised  his, but his foot slipped in a wet place and he fell. At that moment  the buffalo, with a snort of rage, charged straight for the fallen man.    \"Tom! your electric rifle!\" yelled Ned Newton, but he need not have  done so, for the young inventor was on the alert.    Taking instant aim, and adjusting his weapon for the heaviest  charge, Tom fired at the advancing beast. The result was the same as  in the case of the whale, the buffalo seemed to melt away. And it  was stopped only just in time, too, for it was close to the  prostrate Mr. Anderson, who had sprained his ankle slightly, and  could not readily rise.    It was all over in a few seconds, but it was a tense time while it  lasted.    \"You saved my life again, Tom Swift,\" said Mr. Anderson, as he  limped toward our hero. \"Once on Earthquake Island, and again now. I  shan't forget it,\" and he shook hands with the young inventor.    The others congratulated Tom on his quick shot, and Mr. Damon, as  usual blessed everything in sight, and the electric rifle  especially.    They went back to the airship, taking the fresh meat with them, but  on account of the injury to Mr. Anderson's ankle could not make  quick progress, so that it was almost dusk when they reached the  craft.    \"Well, we'll have supper, and then start off,\" proposed Tom, \"I  don't think it would be wise to remain on the ground so near the  jungle.\"    \"No' it's safer in the air,\" agreed Mr. Durban. The meal was much  enjoyed, especially the fresh meat, and, after it was over, Tom took  his place in the pilot house to start the machinery, and send the  airship aloft.    The motor hummed and throbbed, and the gas hissed into the bag, for  the ground was not level enough to permit of a running start by  means of the planes. Lights gleamed from the Black Hawk and the big  search-lantern in front cast a dazzling finger of light into the  black forest.    \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" called Ned, who heard the  machinery in motion, but who could not feel the craft rising. \"Why  don't you go up, Tom?\"    \"I'm trying to,\" answered the young inventor. \"Something seems to be  the matter.\" He pulled the speed lever over a few more notches, and  increased the power of the gas machine. Still the Black Hawk did not  rise.    \"Bless my handkerchief box!\" cried Mr. Damon, \"what's the matter?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom. \"We seem to be held fast.\"    He further increased the speed of the propellers, and the gas  machine was set to make vapor at its fullest capacity, and force it  into the bag. Still the craft was held to the earth.    \"Maybe the gas has no effect in this climate,\" called Ned.    \"It can't be that,\" replied Tom. \"The gas will operate anywhere. It  worked all right today.\"    Suddenly she airship moved up a little way, and then seemed to be  pulled down again, hitting the ground with a bump.    \"Something is holding us!\" cried Tom. \"We're anchored to earth! I  must see what it is!\" and, catching up his electric rifle, he dashed  out of the cabin.          CHAPTER XII    AMONG THE NATIVES      For a moment after Tom's departure the others stared blankly at one  another. They could hear the throbbing and hum of the machinery, and  feel the thrill of the anchored airship. But they could not  understand what the trouble was.    \"We must help Tom!\" cried Ned Newton at length as he caught up his  rifle. \"Maybe we are in the midst of a herd of elephants, and they  have hold of the ship in their trunks.\"    \"It couldn't be!\" declared Mr. Durban, yet they soon discovered that  Ned's guess was nearer the truth then any of them had suspected at  the time.    \"We must help him, true enough!\" declared Mr. Anderson, and he and  the others followed Ned out on deck.    \"Where are you Tom?\" called his chum.    \"Here.\" was the answer. \"I'm on the forward deck.\"    \"Do you see anything?\"    \"No, it's too dark. Turn the search-light this way.\"    \"I will,\" shouted Mr. Damon, and a moment later the gleam of the  powerful lantern brought Tom clearly into view, as he stood on the  small forward observation platform in the bow of the Black Hawk.    An instant later the young inventor let out a startled cry.    \"What is it?\" demanded Mr. Durban.    \"An immense snake!\" shouted Tom. \"It's wound around a tree, and  partly twined around the ship! That's why we couldn't go up! I'm  going to shoot it.\"    They looked to where he pointed, and there, in the glare of the  light, could be seen an immense python, fully twenty-five feet long,  the forward part of its fat ugly body circled around the slender  prow of the airship, while the folds of the tail were about a big  tree.    Tom Swift raised his electric rifle, took quick aim, and, having set  it to deliver a moderate charge, pressed the button. The result was  surprising, for the snake being instantly killed the folds uncoiled  and the ship shot upward, only, instead of rising on an even keel,  the bow pointed toward the sky, while the stern was still fast to  the earth. Tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees the Black Hawk  was in a most peculiar position, and those standing on the deck  began to slide along it.    \"There's another snake at the stern!\" cried Mr. Damon as he grasped  a brace to prevent falling off. \"Bless my slippers! it's the mate of  the one you killed! Shoot the other one, Tom!\"    The young inventor needed no urging. Making his way as best he could  to the stern of the airship, he killed the second python, which was  even larger than the first, and in an instant the Black Hawk shot  upward, this time level, and as it should be. Things on board were  soon righted, and the travelers could stand upright. High above the  black jungle rose the craft, moving forward under the full power of  the propellers, until Tom rushed into the engine room, and reduced  speed.    \"Well, talk about things happening!\" exclaimed Ned, when they had  somewhat recovered from the excitement. \"I should say they were  beginning with a vengeance!\"    \"That's the way in Africa,\" declared Mr. Durban. \"It's a curious  country. Those pythons generally go in pairs, but it's the first  time I ever knew them to tackle an airship. They probably stay  around here where there is plenty of small game for them, and very  likely they merely anchored to our craft while waiting for a supper  to come along.\"    \"It was a very odd thing,\" said Tom. \"I couldn't imagine what held  us. After this I'll see that all is clear before I try to go up.  Next time we may be held by a troop of baboons and it strains the  machinery to have it pull against dead weight in that way.\"    However, it was found no harm had resulted from this experience,  and, after reducing the gas pressure, which was taking them too  high, Tom set the automatic rudders.    \"We'll keep on at slow speed through the night,\" he explained, \"and  in the morning we'll be pretty well into the interior. Then we can  lay our course for wherever we want to go. Where had we better head  for?\"  "]]]
