Grant, Complete (#11)"],[1,"to the troops  enjoined scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons and  the payment of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use of  the army.    All officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to ride  them on the march when it did not interfere with their military duties.  As already related, having lost my \"five or six dollars' worth of  horses\" but a short time before I determined not to get another, but to  make the journey on foot.  My company commander, Captain McCall, had two  good American horses, of considerably more value in that country, where  native horses were cheap, than they were in the States. He used one  himself and wanted the other for his servant.  He was quite anxious to  know whether I did not intend to get me another horse before the march  began.  I told him No; I belonged to a foot regiment.  I did not  understand the object of his solicitude at the time, but, when we were  about to start, he said:  \"There, Grant, is a horse for you.\"  I found  that he could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long march  while his lieutenant went a-foot.  He had found a mustang, a three-year  old colt only recently captured, which had been purchased by one of the  colored servants with the regiment for the sum of three dollars.  It was  probably the only horse at Corpus Christi that could have been purchased  just then for any reasonable price.  Five dollars, sixty-six and  two-thirds per cent. advance, induced the owner to part with the  mustang.  I was sorry to take him, because I really felt that, belonging  to a foot regiment, it was my duty to march with the men.  But I saw the  Captain's earnestness in the matter, and accepted the horse for the  trip.  The day we started was the first time the horse had ever been  under saddle. I had, however, but little difficulty in breaking him,  though for the first day there were frequent disagreements between us as  to which way we should go, and sometimes whether we should go at all.  At no time during the day could I choose exactly the part of the column  I would march with; but after that, I had as tractable a horse as any  with the army, and there was none that stood the trip better. He never  ate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he could pick  within the length of his picket rope.    A few days out from Corpus Christi, the immense herd of wild horses that  ranged at that time between the Nueces and the Rio Grande was seen  directly in advance of the head of the column and but a few miles off.  It was the very band from which the horse I was riding had been captured  but a few weeks before. The column was halted for a rest, and a number  of officers, myself among them, rode out two or three miles to the right  to see the extent of the herd.  The country was a rolling prairie, and,  from the higher ground, the vision was obstructed only by the earth's  curvature.  As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herd  extended.  To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating the  number of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have been  corralled in the State of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time.  If  they had been, they would have been so thick that the pasturage would  have given out the first day. People who saw the Southern herd of  buffalo, fifteen or twenty years ago, can appreciate the  size of the  Texas band of wild horses in 1846.    At the point where the army struck the Little Colorado River, the stream  was quite wide and of sufficient depth for navigation. The water was  brackish and the banks were fringed with timber. Here the whole army  concentrated before attempting to cross. The army was not accompanied by  a pontoon train, and at that time the troops were not instructed in  bridge building.  To add to the embarrassment of the situation, the army  was here, for the first time, threatened with opposition. Buglers,  concealed from our view by the brush on the opposite side, sounded the  \"assembly,\" and other military calls.  Like the wolves before spoken of,  they gave the impression that there was a large number of them and that,  if the troops were in proportion to the noise, they were sufficient to  devour General Taylor and his army.  There were probably but few troops,  and those engaged principally in watching the movements of the  \"invader.\"  A few of our cavalry dashed in, and forded and swam the  stream, and all opposition was soon dispersed.  I do not remember that a  single shot was fired.    The troops waded the stream, which was up to their necks in the deepest  part.  Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to the end of the  wagon tongue passing it between the two swing mules and by the side of  the leader, hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules in  rear to it, and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore.  The bank  down to the water was steep on both sides.  A rope long enough to cross  the river, therefore, was attached to the back axle of the wagon, and  men behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon \"beating\" the mules  into the water.  This latter rope also served the purpose of bringing  the end of the forward one back, to be used over again.  The water was  deep enough for a short distance to swim the little Mexican mules which  the army was then using, but they, and the wagons, were pulled through  so fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead, that no time was left  them to show their obstinacy.  In this manner the artillery and  transportation of the \"army of occupation\" crossed the Colorado River.    About the middle of the month of March the advance of the army reached  the Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the river, opposite  the city of Matamoras and almost under the guns of a small fort at the  lower end of the town.  There was not at that time a single habitation  from Corpus Christi until the Rio Grande was reached.    The work of fortifying was commenced at once.  The fort was laid out by  the engineers, but the work was done by the soldiers under the  supervision of their officers, the chief engineer retaining general  directions.  The Mexicans now became so incensed at our near approach  that some of their troops crossed the river above us, and made it unsafe  for small bodies of men to go far beyond the limits of camp.  They  captured two companies of dragoons, commanded by Captains Thornton and  Hardee.  The latter figured as a general in the late war, on the  Confederate side, and was author of the tactics first used by both  armies.  Lieutenant Theodric Porter, of the 4th infantry, was killed  while out with a small detachment; and Major Cross, the assistant  quartermaster-general, had also been killed not far from camp.    There was no base of supplies nearer than Point Isabel, on the coast,  north of the mouth of the Rio Grande and twenty-five miles away.  The  enemy, if the Mexicans could be called such at this time when no war had  been declared, hovered about in such numbers that it was not safe to  send a wagon train after supplies with any escort that could be spared.  I have already said that General Taylor's whole command on the Rio  Grande numbered less than three thousand men.  He had, however, a few  more troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago.  The supplies brought  from Corpus Christi in wagons were running short.  Work was therefore  pushed with great vigor on the defences, to enable the minimum number of  troops to hold the fort.  All the men who could be employed, were kept  at work from early dawn until darkness closed the labors of the day.  With all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew so  short that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of.  By  the latter part of April the work was in a partially defensible  condition, and the 7th infantry, Major Jacob Brown commanding, was  marched in to garrison it, with some few pieces of artillery.  All the  supplies on hand, with the exception of enough to carry the rest of the  army to Point Isabel, were left with the garrison, and the march was  commenced with the remainder of the command, every wagon being taken  with the army.  Early on the second day after starting the force reached  its destination, without opposition from the Mexicans.  There was some  delay in getting supplies ashore from vessels at anchor in the open  roadstead.        CHAPTER VII.    THE MEXICAN WAR--THE BATTLE OF PALO ALTO--THE BATTLE OF RESACA DE LA  PALMA--ARMY OF INVASION--GENERAL TAYLOR--MOVEMENT ON CAMARGO.    While General Taylor was away with the bulk of his army, the little  garrison up the river was besieged.  As we lay in our tents upon the  sea-shore, the artillery at the fort on the Rio Grande could be  distinctly heard.    The war had begun.    There were no possible means of obtaining news from the garrison, and  information from outside could not be otherwise than unfavorable.  What  General Taylor's feelings were during this suspense I do not know; but  for myself, a young second-lieutenant who had never heard a hostile gun  before, I felt sorry that I had enlisted.  A great many men, when they  smell battle afar off, chafe to get into the fray.  When they say so  themselves they generally fail to convince their hearers that they are  as anxious as they would like to make believe, and as they approach  danger they become more subdued.  This rule is not universal, for I have  known a few men who were always aching for a fight when there was no  enemy near, who were as good as their word when the battle did come.  But the number of such men is small.    On the 7th of May the wagons were all loaded and General Taylor started  on his return, with his army reinforced at Point Isabel, but still less  than three thousand strong, to relieve the garrison on the Rio Grande.  The road from Point Isabel to Matamoras is over an open, rolling,  treeless prairie, until the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],[0,"Sowing Seeds in Danny (#11)"],[1,"opened, and what day she would have, and  many other important things that it is well to have one's mind made up  on and not leave to the last. Maudie Ducker had been taken into the  secret, and began to feel sorry for the other little girls whose papas  were contented to let them live always in such a pokey little place as  Millford. Maudie also began to dream dreams of sweeping in upon the  Millford people in flowing robes and waving plumes and sparkling  diamonds, in a gorgeous red automobile. Wilford Ducker only of the  Ducker family was not taken into the secret. He was too young, his  mother said, to understand the change.    The nomination day was drawing near, which had something to do with the  date of Maudie Ducker's party. Mrs. Ducker told Maudie they must invite  the czar and Pearl Watson, though, of course, she did not say the czar.  She said Algernon Evans and that little Watson girl. Maudie, being a  perfect little lady objected to Pearl Watson on account of her scanty  wardrobe, and to the czar's moist little hands; but Mrs. Ducker,  knowing that the czar's father was their long suit, stood firm.    Mr. Ducker had said to her that very morning, rubbing his hands, and  speaking in the conspirator's voice: \"We must leave no stone unturned.  This is the time of seed-sowing, my dear. We must pull every wire.\"    The czar was a wire, therefore they proceeded to pull him. They did not  know he was a live wire until later.    Pearl Watson's delight at being asked to a real party knew no bounds.  Maudie need not have worried about Pearl's appearing at the feast  without the festal robe. The dress that Camilla had made for her was  just waiting for such an occasion to air its loveliness. Anything that  was needed to complete her toilet was supplied by her kind-hearted  mistress, the czar's mother.    But Mrs. Evans stood looking wistfully after her only son as Pearl  wheeled him gaily down the walk. He was beautifully dressed in the  finest of mull and valenciennes; his carriage was the loveliest they  could buy; Pearl in her neat hat and dress was a little nurse girl to  be proud of. But Mrs. Evans's pretty face was troubled. She was  thinking of the pretty baby pictures in the magazines, and Algernon was  so--different! And his nose was--strange, too, and she had massaged it  so carefully, too, and when, oh when, would he say \"Daddy-dinger!\"    But Algeron was not envious of any other baby's beauty that afternoon,  nor worried about his nose either as he bumped up and down in his  carriage in glad good humour, and delivered full-sized gurgling \"goos\"  at every person he met, even throwing them along the street in the  prodigality of his heart, as he waved his fat hands and thumped his  heavy little heels.    Pearl held her head high and was very much the body-guard as she lifted  the weighty ruler to the ground. Mrs. Ducker ran down the steps and  kissed the czar ostentatiously, pouring out such a volume of admiring  and endearing epithets that Pearl stood in bewilderment, wondering why  she had never heard of this before. Mrs. Ducker carried the czar into  the house, Pearl following with one eye shut, which was her way of  expressing perplexity.    Two little girls in very fluffy short skirts, sat demurely in the  hammock, keeping their dresses clean and wondering if there would be  ice-cream. Within doors Maudie worried out the \"Java March\" on the  piano, to a dozen or more patient little listeners. On the lawn several  little girls played croquet. There were no boys at the party. Wilford  was going to have the boys--that is, the Conservative boys the next  day. Mrs. Ducker did not believe in co-education. Boys are so rough,  except Wilford. He had been so carefully brought up, he was not rough  at all. He stood awkwardly by the gate watching the girls play croquet.  He had been left without a station at his own request. Patsey Watson  rode by on a dray wagon, dirty and jolly. Wilford called to him  furtively, but Patsey was busy holding on and did not hear him. Wilford  sighed heavily. Down at the tracks a freight train shunted and  shuddered. Not a boy was in sight. He knew why. The farmers were  loading cattle cars.    Pearl went around to the side lawn where the girls were playing  croquet, holding the czar's hand tightly.    \"What are you playin'?\" she asked.    They told her.    \"Can you play it?\" Mildred Bates asked.    \"I guess I can,\" Pearl said modestly. \"But I'm always too busy for  games like that!\"    \"Maudie Ducker says you never play,\" Mildred Bates said with pity in  her voice.    \"Maudie Ducker is away off there,\" Pearl answered with dignity. \"I have  more fun in one day than Maudie Ducker'll ever have if she lives to be  as old as Melchesidick, and it's not this frowsy  standin'-round-doin'-nothin' that you kids call fun either.\"    \"Tell us about it, Pearl,\" they shouted eagerly. Pearl's stories had a  charm.    \"Well,\" Pearl began, \"ye know I wash Mrs. Evans's dishes every day, and  lovely ones they are, too, all pink and gold with dinky little ivy  leaves crawlin' out over the edges of the cups. I play I am at the  seashore and the tide is comin' in o'er and o'er the sand and 'round  and 'round the land, far as eye can see--that's out of a book. I put  all the dishes into the big dish pan, and I pertend the tide is risin'  on them, though it's just me pourin' on the water. The cups are the  boys and the saucers are the girls, the plates are the fathers and  mothers and the butter chips are the babies. Then I rush in to save  them, but not until they cry 'Lord save us, we perish!' Of course, I  yell it for them, good and loud too--people don't just squawk at a time  like that--it often scares Mrs. Evans even yet. I save the babies  first, I slush them around to clean them, but they never notice that,  and I stand them up high and dry in the drip-pan. Then I go in after  the girls, and they quiet down the babies in the drip-pan; and then the  mothers I bring out, and the boys and the fathers. Sometimes some of  the men make a dash out before the women, but you bet I lay them back  in a hurry. Then I set the ocean back on the stove, and I rub the  babies to get their blood circlin' again, and I get them all put to bed  on the second shelf and they soon forget they were so near death's  door.\"    Mary Ducker had finished the \"Java March\" and \"Mary's Pet Waltz,\" and  had joined the interested group on the lawn and now stood listening in  dull wonder.    \"I rub them all and shine them well,\" Pearl went on, \"and get them all  packed off home into the china cupboard, every man jack o' them singin'  'Are we yet alive and see each other's face,' Mrs. Evans sings it for  them when she's there.    \"Then I get the vegetable dishes and bowls and silverware and all that,  and that's an excursion, and they're all drunk, not a sober man on  board. They sing 'Sooper up old boys,' 'We won't go home till mornin'  and all that, and crash! a cry bursts from every soul on board. They  have struck upon a rock and are going down! Water pours in at the  gunnel (that's just me with more water and soap, you know), but I ain't  sorry for them, for they're all old enough to know that 'wine is a  mocker, strong drink is ragin', and whosoever is deceived thereby is  not wise.' But when the crash comes and the swellin' waters burst in  they get sober pret' quick and come rushin' up on deck with pale faces  to see what's wrong, and I've often seen a big bowl whirl 'round and  'round kind o' dizzy and say 'woe is me!' and sink to the bottom.  Mrs.  Evans told me that. Anyway I do save them at last, when they see what  whiskey is doin' for them. I rub them all up and send them home. The  steel knives--they're the worst of all. But though they're black and  stained with sin, they're still our brothers, and so we give them the  gold cure--that's the bath-brick, and they make a fresh start.    \"When I sweep the floor I pertend I'm the army of the Lord that comes  to clear the way from dust and sin, let the King of Glory in. Under the  stove the hordes of sin are awful thick, they love darkness rather than  light, because their deeds are evil! But I say the 'sword of the Lord  and of Gideon!' and let them have it! Sometimes I pertend I'm the woman  that lost the piece of silver and I sweep the house diligently till I  find it, and once Mrs. Evans did put ten cents in a corner just for fun  for me, and I never know when she's goin' to do something like that.\"    Here Maudie Ducker, who had been listening with growing wonder  interrupted Pearl with the cry of \"Oh, here's pa and Mr. Evans. They're  going to take our pictures!\"    The little girls were immediately roused out of the spell that  Pearlie's story had put upon them, and began to group themselves under  the trees, arranging their little skirts and frills.    The czar had toddled on his uncertain little fat legs around to the  back door, for he had caught sight of a red head which he knew and  liked very much. It belonged to Mary McSorley, the eldest of the  McSorley family, who had brought over to Mrs. Ducker the extra two  quarts of milk which Mrs. Ducker had ordered for the occasion.    Mary sat on the back step until Mrs. Ducker should find time to empty  her pitcher. Mary was strictly an outsider. Mary's father was a  Reformer. He ran the opposition paper to dear Mr. Evans. Mary was never  well dressed, partly accounted for by the fact that the angels had  visited the McSorley home so often. Therefore, for these reasons, Mary  sat on the back step, a rank outsider.    The czar, who knew nothing of these things, began to \"goo\" as soon as  he saw her. Mary reached out her arms. The czar stumbled into them and  Mary fell to kissing his bald head. She felt more at home with a baby  in her arms.    It was at this unfortunate moment that Mr. Ducker and Mr. Evans came  around to the rear of the house.
