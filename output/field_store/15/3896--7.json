As Katy and Clover went by, Rose  put her head out, and called that she would be down in a minute.    The bathing party consisted of eight girls, with Miss Jane for escort.  They were half way across the common before Miss Jane noticed that  everybody was shaking with stifled laughter, except Rose, who walked  along demurely, apparently unconscious that there was any thing to  laugh at.  Miss Jane looked sharply from one to another for a moment,  then stopped short and exclaimed, \"Rosamond Redding! how dare you?\"    \"What is it ma'am?\" asked Rose, with the face of a lamb.    \"Your bath towel! your sponge!\" gasped Miss Jane.    \"Yes, ma'am, I have them all,\" replied the audacious Rose, putting her  hand to her hat.  There, to be sure, was the long crash towel, hanging  down behind like a veil, while the sponge was fastened on one side like  a great cockade; and in front appeared a cake of pink soap, neatly  pinned into the middle of a black velvet bow.    Miss Jane seized Rose, and removed these ornaments in a twinkling.  \"We shall see what Mrs. Florence thinks of this conduct,\" she grimly  remarked.  Then, dropping the soap and sponge in her own pocket, she  made Rose walk beside her, as if she were a criminal in custody.    The bath-house was a neat place, with eight small rooms, well supplied  with hot and cold water.  Katy would have found her bath very nice, had  it not been for the thought of the walk home.  They must look so absurd,  she reflected, with their sponges and damp towels.    Miss Jane was as good as her word.  After dinner, Rose was sent for by  Mrs. Florence, and had an interview of two hours with her: she came  out with red eyes, and shut herself into her room with a disconsolate  bang.  Before long, however, she revived sufficiently to tap on the  drawers and push through a note with the following words:--                               \"My heart is broken!                                                 \"R.R.\"      Clover hastened in to comfort her.  Rose was sitting on the floor,  with a very clean pocket-handkerchief in her hand.  She wept, and  put her head against Clover's knee.    \"I suppose I'm the nastiest girl in the world,\" she said.  \"Mrs.  Florence thinks so.  She said I was an evil influence in the school.  Wasn't that un--kind?\" with a little sob.    \"I meant to be so good this term,\" she went on; \"but what's the use?  A codfish might as well try to play the piano!  It was always so, even  when I was a baby.  Sylvia says I have got a little fiend inside of me.  Do you believe I have?  Is it that makes me so horrid?\"    Clover purred over her.  She could not bear to have Rose feel badly.  \"Wasn't Miss Jane funny?\" went on Rose, with a sudden twinkle; \"and  did you see Berry, and Alfred Seccomb?\"    \"No: where were they?\"    \"Close to us, standing by the fence.  All the time Miss Jane was  unpinning the towel, they were splitting their sides, and Berry made  such a face at me that I nearly laughed out.  That boy has a perfect  genius for faces.  He used to frighten Sylvia and me into fits, when  we were little tots, up here on visits.\"    \"Then you knew him before you came to school?\"    \"Oh dear, yes!  I know all the Hillsover boys.  We used to make mud  pies together.  They're grown up now, most of 'em, and in college;  and when we meet, we're very dignified, and say, 'Miss Redding,' and  'Mr. Seccomb,' and 'Mr. Searles;' but we're just as good friends as  ever.  When I go to take tea with Mrs. Seccomb, Alfred always invites  Berry to drop in, and we have the greatest fun.  Mrs. Florence won't  let me go this term, though, I guess, she's so mad about the towel.\"    Katy was quite relieved when Clover reported this conversation.  Rose,  for all her wickedness, seemed to be a little lady.  Katy did not like  to class her among the girls who flirted with students whom they did  not know.    It was wonderful how soon they all settled down, and became accustomed  to their new life.  Before six weeks were over, Katy and Clover felt  as if they had lived at Hillsover for years.  This was partly because  there was so much to do.  Nothing makes time fly like having every  moment filled, and every hour set apart for a distinct employment.    They made several friends, chief among whom were Ellen Gray and Louisa  Agnew.  This last intimacy Lilly resented highly, and seemed to consider  as an affront to herself.  With no one, however, was Katy so intimate  as Clover was with Rose Red.  This cost Katy some jealous pangs at  first.  She was so used to considering Clover her own exclusive  property that it was not easy to share her with another; and she  had occasional fits of feeling resentful, and injured, and left out.  These were but momentary, however.  Katy was too healthy of mind to  let unkind feelings grow, and by and by she grew fond of Rose and  Rose of her, so that in the end the sisters share their friend as  they did other nice things, and neither of them was jealous of the  other.    But, charming as she was, a certain price had to be paid for the  pleasure of intimacy with Rose.  Her overflowing spirits, and \"the  little fiend inside her,\" were always provoking scrapes, in which  her friends were apt to be more or less involved.  She was very  pen intent and afflicted after these scrapes; but it didn't make a  bit of difference: the next time she was just as naughty as ever.    \"What are you?\" said Katy, one day, meeting her in the hall with a  heap of black shawls and aprons on her arm.    \"Hush!\" whispered Rose, mysteriously, \"don't say a word.  Senator  Brown is dead--our senator, you know.  I'm going to put my window  into mourning for him, that's all.  It's a proper token of respect.\"    Two hours later, Mrs. Nipson, walking sedately across the common,  noticed quite a group of students, in the president's yard, looking  up at the Nunnery.  She drew nearer.  They were admiring Rose's  window, hung with black, and decorated with a photograph of the  deceased senator, suspended in the middle of a wreath of weeping-  willow.  Of course she hurried upstairs, and tore down the shawls  and aprons; and, equally of course, Rose had a lecture and a mark;  but, dear me! what good did it do?  The next day but one, as Katy  and Clover sat together in silent study hour, their lower drawer was  pushed open very noiselessly and gently, till it came out entirely,  and lay on the floor, and in the aperture thus formed appeared Roses's  saucy face flushed with mischief.  She was crawling through from her  own room!    \"Such fun!\" she whispered; \"I never thought of this before!  We can  have parties in study hours, and all sorts of things.\"    \"Oh, go back, Rosy!\" whispered Clover in agonized entreaty, though  laughing all the time.    \"Go back?  Not at all!  I'm coming in,\" answered Rose, pulling herself  through a little farther.  But at that moment the door opened: there  stood Miss Jane!  She had caught the buzz of voices, as she passed in  the hall, and had entered to see what was going on.    Rose, dreadfully frightened, made a rapid movement to withdraw.  But the  space was narrow, and she had wedged herself, and could move neither  backward nor forward.  She had to submit to being helped through by  Miss Jane, in a series of pulls, while Katy and Clover sat by, not  daring to laugh or to offer assistance.  When Rose was on her feet,  Miss Jane released her with a final shake, which she seemed unable  to refrain from giving.    \"Go to your room,\" she said; \"I shall report all of you young ladies  for this flagrant act of disobedience.\"    Rose went, and in two minutes the drawer, which Miss Jane had replaced,  opened again, and there was this note:--         \"If I'm never heard of more, give my love to my family, and      mention how I died.  I forgive my enemies; and leave Clover      my band bracelet.                 \"My blessings on you both.                          \"With the deepest regard,                              \"Your afflicted friend, R. R.\"      Mrs. Florence was very angry on this occasion, and would listen to no  explanations, but gave Katy and Clover a \"disobedience mark\" also.  This was very unfair, and Rose felt dreadfully about it.  She begged  and entreated; but Mrs. Florence only replied: \"There is blame on both  sides, I have no doubt.\"    \"She's entirely changed from what she used to be,\" declared Rose.  \"I  don't know what's the matter; I don't like her half so much as I did.\"    The truth was, that Mrs. Florence had secretly determined to give up  her connection with the school at midsummer; and, regarding it now  rather as Mrs. Nipson's school than her own, she took no pains to  study character or mete out justice carefully among scholars with  whom she was not likely to have much to do.          CHAPTER VI.  THE S. S. U. C.      It was Saturday afternoon; and Clover, having finished her practising,  dusting, and mending, had settle herself in No. 6 for a couple of hours  of quiet enjoyment.  Every thing was in beautiful order to meet Miss  Jane's inspecting eye; and Clover, as she sat in the rocking chair,  writing-case in lap, looked extremely cosy and comfortable.    A half-finished letter to Elsie lay in the writing-case; but Clover  felt lazy, and instead of writing was looking out of window in a dreamy  way, to where Berry Searles and some other young men were playing  ball in the yard below.  She was not thinking of them or of any thing  else in particular.  A vague sense of pleasant idleness possessed her,  and it was like the breaking of a dream when the door opened and Katy  came in, not quietly after her wont, but with a certain haste and  indignant rustle as if vexed by something.  When she saw Clover at  the window, she cried out hastily, \"O Clover, don't'!\"    \"Don't what?\" asked Clover, without turning her head.    \"Don't sit there looking at those boys.\"    \"Why? why not?  They can't see me."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51547"],[0,"The Story of the Airship (Non-rigid) (#11)"],[1,"ent, in the last case amounting to 1,250 miles of additional  cruising radius.    A trans-oceanic passenger airship could start out with virtually no  water ballast at all except a minimum amount for maneuvering, use its  fuel supply as ballast and pick up sea water as needed. This could be  done at 500 feet elevation, at the rate of 80 gallons a minute, using a  30 horsepower motor, could be done in half an hour a day. The ship need  not slow down materially while doing this.    Application of this principle to military airships of the rigid type  might be still more significant. The chief use for the rigid airship in  war would seem to be as a high speed airplane carrier, whose planes  would increase many fold its own reconnaissance range, and would be  expected also to do the major part of what fighting became necessary in  case of enemy contact. The airship itself in that situation would put  more dependence on its speed of retreat and its ability to seek cover in  clouds as the submarine does beneath the surface, than on its own  machine guns and cannons.    One thing brought urgently home to us in the first weeks of the present  war is that oceans are wide, and that the movements of even a huge enemy  fleet are difficult to discover in those endless expanses of water.    Large military airships of five or ten million cubic feet helium  capacity might prove exceedingly useful, if they were able to operate  away from their base for weeks or even months at a time, and they might  be able to do this by utilizing devices similar to those developed for  smaller non-rigids, resting on the sea in calm waters, mooring to  anchored masts they could lower into the water, picking up fuel from  tankers, getting supplies from neighboring ships--in addition to what  was carried to them from the fleet by their own planes.                                        CHAPTER VII                      Adventures of the Goodyear Fleet          [Illustration: Airships flying in formation]    One of the lesser romances at least of aeronautics is the story of the  Goodyear airship fleet.    There is thrill and adventure in the narrative, daring and  resourcefulness, hazards faced by men who believed in their  craft--chances which were usually won. So this chapter might well be  dedicated to Airship Captain Charles Brannigan and Balloon Pilot Walter  Morton.    Morton was an old timer, who had flown balloons with Tom Baldwin, in the  far corners of the country. Between times he worked in the Goodyear  balloon room, a practical mechanic who could always make things work,  the salt-of-the-earth workman whom every foreman swore by, the aide  every pilot wanted alongside. Steady, self-effacing, courageous, with an  instinct for the right thing to do in emergency, Morton feared but one  thing. That was lightning.    He had flown many times through lightning storms prior to the helium  era, beneath a bag filled with inflammable gas, but he didn't like it.  He knew its swift striking power.    \"I could almost see the Old Fellow standing there throwing those darts  at us,\" said Morton one afternoon in 1928, as he scanned the skies  before taking off in a balloon race out of Pittsburgh. \"One would flash  past and miss, and he would say 'I'll get you next time,' and there  would come another. And you can't dodge in a balloon.\"    The Old Fellow scored a direct hit that afternoon. Morton was flying  with Van Orman, Gordon Bennett Cup winner. The uncertain weather of the  afternoon had resolved itself less than an hour after the take-off, and  eight balloons were being tossed as a juggler tosses weights, a thousand  feet high, 10,000 feet, caught and tossed aloft again just before they  touched the ground. Morton's balloon was hit at 12,000 feet, caught  fire, alternatively fell like a plumb bob or parachuted in the net,  landed without too much of a shock. Van Orman, unconscious, sustained a  broken ankle. Morton had been instantly killed.    But aerologists learned things that afternoon about the force of  vertical movements of the air. The balloons gave a perfect track of what  went on. One balloon was falling so fast that sacks of ballast thrown  overboard lagged behind it, while a hundred yards away another balloon  was shooting upward at similar speed.    We still know less than we should about the movements of the air, this  new world into which the Aeronautic Age is moving. The Pittsburgh  tragedy may save many lives, avoid other tragedies.    The Brannigan story is shorter, no less dramatic. High-spirited, keen, a  captain whose ship and crew must always be shipshape, Brannigan had come  to Goodyear from the Army--where he had already distinguished himself by  making repairs in mid air to the semi-rigid Roma, ripped by a splintered  propeller--saving a comrade as an incident to the job--had quickly won  his captaincy at Goodyear, was one of its best flyers.    At Kansas City one afternoon in 1931 a Kansas twister headed for the  airport. Seeing the weather uncertain Brannigan had stopped passenger  flying, put his ship on the mast. Now he ordered his mechanic to get off  and cut the ship loose. Once aloft, with helium gas, he was not afraid  of any storm that blew. But before the ship could clear the mast, the  storm had struck, with full fury. The anchors holding the mast pulled  out of the ground and the ship, with the mast attached, was hurled into  the nearest hangar, ripping one motor off. That was Brannigan's cue to  jump. The door had been propped open for a photographer's camera. But he  had one motor left, the bag was undamaged, the mast had fallen clear. He  wouldn't give up his ship as long as there was a chance to save it.        [Illustration: Reunion in Akron--The ships comprising the Goodyear      fleet, could tell stirring stories of battles with the elements      waged in many states.]        [Illustration: Some of these pilots flew airships in the first war,      others came in later from the technical schools--many now are flying      airships for the Navy.]        [Illustration: From this pocket handkerchief size airport, off the      Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, Goodyear ships carried      thousands of passengers, from all over America.]        [Illustration: The Mayflower landed on the deck of the SS Bremen,      took off passenger P. W. Litchfield.]        [Illustration: The Enterprise lands to rescue the crew of an      ice-locked steamer in Chesapeake Bay.]    However the storm was not to be denied, and before he could get  altitude, the wind threw the ship into a nest of high-tension wires, set  it afire. Brannigan climbed out, walked to a nearby automobile,  transferred to a second car enroute to the hospital after a  collision--and died the next day from third-degree burns.    He called Furculow, his co-pilot, just before the end, told him to see  that the men in the crew were taken care of, that they were not  penalized for the loss of the ship. Furculow, now flying airships for  the Navy, is not the only man in Goodyear who will not forget Charley  Brannigan. It is on such men that the traditions of the service are  built. Any cause for which men give their lives cannot be held lightly.    The Goodyear Company had built a few airships of its own prior to the  1925 Pilgrim, when helium became available. Best known of these was the  \"Pony Blimp\" which operated out of Los Angeles from 1919 to 1923, flew  passengers to Catalina, worked for the movies in Arizona and Wyoming.    But the real beginning came with the Pilgrim, the larger Puritan and  still larger Defender, as the Goodyear fleet came into existence in  1928-29.    Early pilots had no specific instructions except to take the ships out  and fly them--fly them hard, find out all they could about them, see  what weaknesses and shortcomings there were and how to improve them. It  was another test fleet, repeating the history of the automobile.    The pilots were supposed not to get hurt, but they were to fly in all  kinds of weather they felt it safe to fly in. They might lose a few  ships, but were expected to be able to walk away from them, not to get  in any trouble they couldn't get out of. They had an advantage over Army  and Navy fliers in having a free hand as to where they might go. They  were expected to make mistakes but should learn from them.    Such instructions, largely unwritten, acted as a challenge to the  pilots, a high-spirited and courageous group. Starting with a few men  who had flown airships in the World War, or helped build them in the  balloon room and the machine shop, they added some technical school  graduates in 1929, and others as needed.    Their adventures started after they left Akron. Operating from bases  built or leased over the country, they would cover every state east of  the Mississippi in a few years. They looked for hard things to do--or  unusual things which would interest the public in airships. They landed  on the roofs of buildings in Akron and in Washington--though a prudent  Department of Commerce would later rule against that; they picked up  mail from lines dropped on decks of incoming ships, and from small boats  alongside; they fished for sharks and barracuda, hunted for whales; they  picked up a bundle of newspapers from the Hearst building downtown, and  lowered them to Al Smith on the top deck of the Empire State building;  picked up another batch from The Toronto Star offices, delivered them at  the Canadian Exposition grounds; they covered boat races, football and  baseball games, the International Yacht Races, carrying press  photographers, newsreel men and radio announcers; they went to the Mardi  Gras, to the Carnival of States, the Cotton Carnival, Expositions at  Chicago, Dallas, Cleveland, San Francisco and New York, to county fairs,  plowing and corn-husking contests. They covered fires in New York,  chased outlaws and reported forest fires in the high Sierras; they made"]]]
