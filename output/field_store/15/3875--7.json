This indefinable  quality constitutes the individuality of the animal, and gives rise to  the pleasure we feel in watching the animal's actions.  In a human  being, provided he has not been crushed by an economic or governmental  machine, there is the same kind of individuality, a something  distinctive without which no man or woman can achieve much of  importance, or retain the full dignity which is native to human  beings.  It is this distinctive individuality that is loved by the  artist, whether painter or writer.  The artist himself, and the man  who is creative in no matter what direction, has more of it than the  average man.  Any society which crushes this quality, whether  intentionally or by accident, must soon become utterly lifeless and  traditional, without hope of progress and without any purpose in its  being.  To preserve and strengthen the impulse that makes  individuality should be the foremost object of all political  institutions.      IV    We now arrive at certain general principles in regard to individual  liberty and public control.    The greater part of human impulses may be divided into two classes,  those which are possessive and those which are constructive or  creative.  Social institutions are the garments or embodiments of  impulses, and may be classified roughly according to the impulses  which they embody.  Property is the direct expression of  possessiveness; science and art are among the most direct expressions  of creativeness.  Possessiveness is either defensive or aggressive; it  seeks either to retain against a robber, or to acquire from a present  holder.  In either case an attitude of hostility toward others is of  its essence.  It would be a mistake to suppose that defensive  possessiveness is always justifiable, while the aggressive kind is  always blameworthy; where there is great injustice in the _status  quo_, the exact opposite may be the case, and ordinarily neither is  justifiable.    State interference with the actions of individuals is necessitated by  possessiveness.  Some goods can be acquired or retained by force,  while others cannot.  A wife can be acquired by force, as the Romans  acquired the Sabine women; but a wife's affection cannot be acquired  in this way.  There is no record that the Romans desired the affection  of the Sabine women; and those in whom possessive impulses are strong  tend to care chiefly for the goods that force can secure.  All  material goods belong to this class.  Liberty in regard to such goods,  if it were unrestricted, would make the strong rich and the weak poor.  In a capitalistic society, owing to the partial restraints imposed by  law, it makes cunning men rich and honest men poor, because the force  of the state is put at men's disposal, not according to any just or  rational principle, but according to a set of traditional maxims of  which the explanation is purely historical.    In all that concerns possession and the use of force, unrestrained  liberty involves anarchy and injustice.  Freedom to kill, freedom to  rob, freedom to defraud, no longer belong to individuals, though they  still belong to great states, and are exercised by them in the name of  patriotism.  Neither individuals nor states ought to be free to exert  force on their own initiative, except in such sudden emergencies as  will subsequently be admitted in justification by a court of law.  The  reason for this is that the exertion of force by one individual  against another is always an evil on both sides, and can only be  tolerated when it is compensated by some overwhelming resultant good.  In order to minimize the amount of force actually exerted in the  world, it is necessary that there should be a public authority, a  repository of practically irresistible force, whose function should be  primarily to repress the private use of force.  A use of force is  _private_ when it is exerted by one of the interested parties, or by  his friends or accomplices, not by a public neutral authority  according to some rule which is intended to be in the public interest.    The regime of private property under which we live does much too  little to restrain the private use of force.  When a man owns a piece  of land, for example, he may use force against trespassers, though  they must not use force against him.  It is clear that some  restriction of the liberty of trespass is necessary for the  cultivation of the land.  But if such powers are to be given to an  individual, the state ought to satisfy itself that he occupies no more  land than he is warranted in occupying in the public interest, and  that the share of the produce of the land that comes to him is no more  than a just reward for his labors.  Probably the only way in which  such ends can be achieved is by state ownership of land.  The  possessors of land and capital are able at present, by economic  pressure, to use force against those who have no possessions.  This  force is sanctioned by law, while force exercised by the poor against  the rich is illegal.  Such a state of things is unjust, and does not  diminish the use of private force as much as it might be diminished.    The whole realm of the possessive impulses, and of the use of force to  which they give rise, stands in need of control by a public neutral  authority, in the interests of liberty no less than of justice.  Within a nation, this public authority will naturally be the state; in  relations between nations, if the present anarchy is to cease, it will  have to be some international parliament.    But the motive underlying the public control of men's possessive  impulses should always be the increase of liberty, both by the  prevention of private tyranny and by the liberation of creative  impulses.  If public control is not to do more harm than good, it must  be so exercised as to leave the utmost freedom of private initiative  in all those ways that do not involve the private use of force.  In  this respect all governments have always failed egregiously, and there  is no evidence that they are improving.    The creative impulses, unlike those that are possessive, are directed  to ends in which one man's gain is not another man's loss.  The man  who makes a scientific discovery or writes a poem is enriching others  at the same time as himself.  Any increase in knowledge or good-will  is a gain to all who are affected by it, not only to the actual  possessor.  Those who feel the joy of life are a happiness to others  as well as to themselves.  Force cannot create such things, though it  can destroy them; no principle of distributive justice applies to  them, since the gain of each is the gain of all.  For these reasons,  the creative part of a man's activity ought to be as free as possible  from all public control, in order that it may remain spontaneous and  full of vigor.  The only function of the state in regard to this part  of the individual life should be to do everything possible toward  providing outlets and opportunities.    In every life a part is governed by the community, and a part by  private initiative.  The part governed by private initiative is  greatest in the most important individuals, such as men of genius and  creative thinkers.  This part ought only to be restricted when it is  predatory; otherwise, everything ought to be done to make it as great  and as vigorous as possible.  The object of education ought not to be  to make all men think alike, but to make each think in the way which  is the fullest expression of his own personality.  In the choice of a  means of livelihood all young men and young women ought, as far as  possible, to be able to choose what is attractive to them; if no  money-making occupation is attractive, they ought to be free to do  little work for little pay, and spend their leisure as they choose.  Any kind of censure on freedom of thought or on the dissemination of  knowledge is, of course, to be condemned utterly.    Huge organizations, both political and economic, are one of the  distinguishing characteristics of the modern world.  These  organizations have immense power, and often use their power to  discourage originality in thought and action.  They ought, on the  contrary, to give the freest scope that is possible without producing  anarchy or violent conflict.  They ought not to take cognizance of any  part of a man's life except what is concerned with the legitimate  objects of public control, namely, possessions and the use of force.  And they ought, by devolution, to leave as large a share of control as  possible in the hands of individuals and small groups.  If this is not  done, the men at the head of these vast organizations will infallibly  become tyrannous through the habit of excessive power, and will in  time interfere in ways that crush out individual initiative.    The problem which faces the modern world is the combination of  individual initiative with the increase in the scope and size of  organizations.  Unless it is solved, individuals will grow less and  less full of life and vigor, and more and more passively submissive to  conditions imposed upon them.  A society composed of such individuals  cannot be progressive or add much to the world's stock of mental and  spiritual possessions.  Only personal liberty and the encouragement of  initiative can secure these things.  Those who resist authority when  it encroaches upon the legitimate sphere of the individual are  performing a service to society, however little society may value it.  In regard to the past, this is universally acknowledged; but it is no  less true in regard to the present and the future.          Chapter V: National Independence and Internationalism      In the relations between states, as in the relations of groups within  a single state, what is to be desired is independence for each as  regards internal affairs, and law rather than private force as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/479"],[0,"Little Lord Fauntleroy (#11)"],[1,"that he would scarcely be allowed to make  playmates of the gate-keeper's children. The lawyer thought there was  time enough for giving him that information.    The carriage rolled on and on between the great, beautiful trees which  grew on each side of the avenue and stretched their broad, swaying  branches in an arch across it. Cedric had never seen such trees,--they  were so grand and stately, and their branches grew so low down on their  huge trunks. He did not then know that Dorincourt Castle was one of the  most beautiful in all England; that its park was one of the broadest and  finest, and its trees and avenue almost without rivals. But he did know  that it was all very beautiful. He liked the big, broad-branched trees,  with the late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances through them. He  liked the perfect stillness which rested on everything. He felt a great,  strange pleasure in the beauty of which he caught glimpses under and  between the sweeping boughs--the great, beautiful spaces of the park,  with still other trees standing sometimes stately and alone, and  sometimes in groups. Now and then they passed places where tall ferns  grew in masses, and again and again the ground was azure with the  bluebells swaying in the soft breeze. Several times he started up with  a laugh of delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the greenery and  scudded away with a twinkle of short white tail behind it. Once a covey  of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away, and then he shouted  and clapped his hands.    \"It's a beautiful place, isn't it?\" he said to Mr. Havisham. \"I never  saw such a beautiful place. It's prettier even than Central Park.\"    He was rather puzzled by the length of time they were on their way.    \"How far is it,\" he said, at length, \"from the gate to the front door?\"    \"It is between three and four miles,\" answered the lawyer.    \"That's a long way for a person to live from his gate,\" remarked his  lordship.    Every few minutes he saw something new to wonder at and admire. When he  caught sight of the deer, some couched in the grass, some standing with  their pretty antlered heads turned with a half-startled air toward the  avenue as the carriage wheels disturbed them, he was enchanted.    \"Has there been a circus?\" he cried; \"or do they live here always? Whose  are they?\"    \"They live here,\" Mr. Havisham told him. \"They belong to the Earl, your  grandfather.\"    It was not long after this that they saw the castle. It rose up before  them stately and beautiful and gray, the last rays of the sun casting  dazzling lights on its many windows. It had turrets and battlements and  towers; a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls; all the broad, open  space about it was laid out in terraces and lawns and beds of brilliant  flowers.    \"It's the most beautiful place I ever saw!\" said Cedric, his round face  flushing with pleasure. \"It reminds any one of a king's palace. I saw a  picture of one once in a fairy-book.\"    He saw the great entrance-door thrown open and many servants standing in  two lines looking at him. He wondered why they were standing there, and  admired their liveries very much. He did not know that they were there  to do honor to the little boy to whom all this splendor would one  day belong,--the beautiful castle like the fairy king's palace, the  magnificent park, the grand old trees, the dells full of ferns and  bluebells where the hares and rabbits played, the dappled, large-eyed  deer couching in the deep grass. It was only a couple of weeks since he  had sat with Mr. Hobbs among the potatoes and canned peaches, with his  legs dangling from the high stool; it would not have been possible for  him to realize that he had very much to do with all this grandeur. At  the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly woman in a rich,  plain black silk gown; she had gray hair and wore a cap. As he entered  the hall she stood nearer than the rest, and the child thought from the  look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him. Mr. Havisham, who  held his hand, paused a moment.    \"This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon,\" he said. \"Lord Fauntleroy, this  is Mrs. Mellon, who is the housekeeper.\"    Cedric gave her his hand, his eyes lighting up.    \"Was it you who sent the cat?\" he said. \"I'm much obliged to you,  ma'am.\"    Mrs. Mellon's handsome old face looked as pleased as the face of the  lodge-keeper's wife had done.    \"I should know his lordship anywhere,\" she said to Mr. Havisham. \"He has  the Captain's face and way. It's a great day, this, sir.\"    Cedric wondered why it was a great day. He looked at Mrs. Mellon  curiously. It seemed to him for a moment as if there were tears in her  eyes, and yet it was evident she was not unhappy. She smiled down on  him.    \"The cat left two beautiful kittens here,\" she said; \"they shall be sent  up to your lordship's nursery.\"    Mr. Havisham said a few words to her in a low voice.    \"In the library, sir,\" Mrs. Mellon replied. \"His lordship is to be taken  there alone.\"      A few minutes later, the very tall footman in livery, who had escorted  Cedric to the library door, opened it and announced: \"Lord Fauntleroy,  my lord,\" in quite a majestic tone. If he was only a footman, he felt it  was rather a grand occasion when the heir came home to his own land and  possessions, and was ushered into the presence of the old Earl, whose  place and title he was to take.    Cedric crossed the threshold into the room. It was a very large and  splendid room, with massive carven furniture in it, and shelves upon  shelves of books; the furniture was so dark, and the draperies so heavy,  the diamond-paned windows were so deep, and it seemed such a distance  from one end of it to the other, that, since the sun had gone down, the  effect of it all was rather gloomy. For a moment Cedric thought there  was nobody in the room, but soon he saw that by the fire burning on the  wide hearth there was a large easy-chair and that in that chair some one  was sitting--some one who did not at first turn to look at him.    But he had attracted attention in one quarter at least. On the floor,  by the arm-chair, lay a dog, a huge tawny mastiff, with body and limbs  almost as big as a lion's; and this great creature rose majestically and  slowly, and marched toward the little fellow with a heavy step.    Then the person in the chair spoke. \"Dougal,\" he called, \"come back,  sir.\"    But there was no more fear in little Lord Fauntleroy's heart than there  was unkindness--he had been a brave little fellow all his life. He put  his hand on the big dog's collar in the most natural way in the world,  and they strayed forward together, Dougal sniffing as he went.    And then the Earl looked up. What Cedric saw was a large old man with  shaggy white hair and eyebrows, and a nose like an eagle's beak between  his deep, fierce eyes. What the Earl saw was a graceful, childish figure  in a black velvet suit, with a lace collar, and with love-locks waving  about the handsome, manly little face, whose eyes met his with a look of  innocent good-fellowship. If the Castle was like the palace in a fairy  story, it must be owned that little Lord Fauntleroy was himself rather  like a small copy of the fairy prince, though he was not at all aware  of the fact, and perhaps was rather a sturdy young model of a fairy.  But there was a sudden glow of triumph and exultation in the fiery old  Earl's heart as he saw what a strong, beautiful boy this grandson was,  and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood with his hand on the big  dog's neck. It pleased the grim old nobleman that the child should show  no shyness or fear, either of the dog or of himself.    Cedric looked at him just as he had looked at the woman at the lodge and  at the housekeeper, and came quite close to him.    \"Are you the Earl?\" he said. \"I'm your grandson, you know, that Mr.  Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy.\"    He held out his hand because he thought it must be the polite and proper  thing to do even with earls. \"I hope you are very well,\" he continued,  with the utmost friendliness. \"I'm very glad to see you.\"    The Earl shook hands with him, with a curious gleam in his eyes; just at  first, he was so astonished that he scarcely knew what to say. He stared  at the picturesque little apparition from under his shaggy brows, and  took it all in from head to foot.    \"Glad to see me, are you?\" he said.    \"Yes,\" answered Lord Fauntleroy, \"very.\"    There was a chair near him, and he sat down on it; it was a high-backed,  rather tall chair, and his feet did not touch the floor when he had  settled himself in it, but he seemed to be quite comfortable as he sat  there, and regarded his august relative intently but modestly.    \"I've kept wondering what you would look like,\" he remarked. \"I used to  lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my  father.\"    \"Am I?\" asked the Earl.    \"Well,\" Cedric replied, \"I was very young when he died, and I may not  remember exactly how he looked, but I don't think you are like him.\"    \"You are disappointed, I suppose?\" suggested his grandfather.    \"Oh, no,\" responded Cedric politely. \"Of course you would like any one  to look like your father; but of course you would enjoy the way your  grandfather looked, even if he wasn't like your father. You know how it  is yourself about admiring your relations.\"    The Earl leaned back in his chair and stared. He could not be said to  know how it was about admiring his relations. He had employed most of  his noble leisure in quarreling violently with them, in turning them out  of his house, and applying abusive epithets to them; and they all hated  him cordially.    \"Any boy would love his grandfather,\" continued Lord Fauntleroy,  \"especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been.\"    Another queer gleam came into the old nobleman's eyes.    \"Oh!\" he said, \"I have been"]]]
