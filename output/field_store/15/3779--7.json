Hanumant, who, in the _Ramayanam_, goes in  quest of the health-giving grass to restore their souls to the half-dead  heroes, looks for it now between the mountain bull (_rishabhas_) and the  heavenly mountain _Kailasas_, now between the Mount Lunus (_Candras_)  and the mountain cup (_Dronas_); and the mountain which possesses the  herb for which Hanumant is searching is itself called herb (_oshadhis_),  or the one that causes to rejoice with perfumes (_Gandhamadanas_[165]),  which two words are used synonymously. Here the milky, ambrosial, and  healthful humour is supposed to be produced, not by a cow, but by an  herb. And the gods and demons contend in heaven for the possession of  this herb, as well as for the ambrosia; the only difference being that  the gods enjoy both one and the other without corrupting them, whilst  the demons poison them as they drink them; that is to say, they spread  darkness over the light, they move about in the darkness, in the gloomy  waters, in the black humour which comes out of the herb itself, which,  in contact with them, becomes poisonous, so that they in turn suck the  poison. On the other hand, the _Gandharvas_,[166] an amphibious race, in  whom at one time the nature of the gods predominates, at another that of  the demons, and who consequently take now the side of the gods, now that  of the demons, are simply guards who, as against theft, keep watch and  ward over the perfumes and healthful herbs, which are their own  property, and the healthful or ambrosial waters, the ambrosia which  belongs to their wives, the nymphs; they are, in a word, the earliest  representatives of the enjoying and jealous proprietor. We have already  heard, in the _Rigvedas_, the demoniacal monsters call on each other to  suck the poison of the celestial cows; and we have seen that the  _Aitareya-brahmanam_ accuses a witch of being the poisoner of the divine  ambrosia; we have, moreover, noticed that a Vedic hymn already  associates together the ambrosial milk and the healthful herb, and that,  in the brahmanic cosmogony, the milk and the herb which produces it are  manifested together, which herb or grass is beneficent or the reverse  according as the gods or the demons enjoy it; from all which it will be  easy to understand this interesting Hindoo proverb, \"The grass gives  the milk to the cows, and the milk gives the poison to the  serpents.\"[167] It is indeed the milk of the cow of the dawn and of the  cow of the moon which destroys the serpents of darkness, the demoniacal  shadows of night.    But the idea of the healthful herb is incorporated in another image,  very familiar to the popular Indo-European legends, and which is  contained even in the Vedic hymns. The cow produces the sun and the  moon; the circular shape, the disc of sun and moon, suggests variously  the idea of a ring, a gem, and a pearl; and the sun, _Savitar_, he who  gives the juice, and the generator, is introduced in a Vedic hymn, as  the one who has immortal juice, who gives the pearl.[168] The humours of  the cow have passed to the herb, and from the herb to the pearl; and the  naturalness of this figure recommends itself to our modern conception,  for when we would describe a diamond or other gem as of the purest  quality, we say it is a diamond or gem of the first water. Even the  pearl-moon and the pearl-sun, from their ambrosial humours, have a fine  water. In the _Ramayanam_,[169] at the moment of production of ambrosia  from the stirring up of the milky sea, we see, near the healthful  herb, the gem _Kaustubhas_, the same which we afterwards find on the  breast of the sun-god Vishnus, and which is sometimes his navel;  whence Vishnus, in the _Mahabharatam_,[170] is saluted by the name of  _ratnanabhas_--that is to say, he who has a pearl for his navel; as the  sun is in like manner saluted by the name of _Manicringas_--_i.e._, who  has horns of pearls.[171] In the _Ramayanam_,[172] the bright-shining  grass and the solar disc appear together on the summit of the mountain  Gandhamadanas; no sooner does he smell its odour than the solar hero  _Lakshmanas_, delivered from the iron that oppressed him, lifts himself  up from the ground; _i.e._, scarcely has the sun formed his disc, and  begun to shine like a celestial gem, than the sun-hero, whom the  monsters had vanquished during the night, rises in victory. And it is on  the summit of the mountain that, with a mountain metal of a colour  similar to that of the young sun,[173] the sun _Ramas_ imprints a  dazzling mark on the forehead of the dawn Sita, as if to be able to  recognise her--that is to say, he places himself upon the forehead of  the aurora or dawn. When the sun Ramas is separated from the dawn Sita,  he sends her in recognition, as a symbol of his disc, his own ring,  which appears again in the famous ring given by King _Dushmantas_ to the  beautiful _Cakuntala_, the daughter of the nymph, and by means of which  alone the lost bride can be recognised by the young and forgetful king;  and Sita sends back to Ramas, by the hands of Hanumant, as a sign of  recognition, the dazzling ornament which Ramas had one day placed upon  her forehead in an idyllic scene among the mountains known to them  alone. This ring of recognition, this magic pearl, often turns up in the  Hindoo legends. It is enough for me to indicate here the two most famous  examples.    The aurora who possesses the pearl becomes she who is rich in pearls,  and herself a source of pearls; but the pearl, as we have already  seen, is not only the sun, it is also the moon. The moon is the friend  of the aurora; she comforts her in the evening under her persecutions;  she loads her with presents during the night, accompanies and guides  her, and helps her to find her husband.    In the _Ramayanam_, I frequently find the moon as a beneficent fairy,  who succours the dawn Sita; for the moon, as _raganikaras_ (she who  gives light to the night), assumes a benignant aspect. We have already  said that the moon is generally a male in India; but as full moon and  new moon it assumes, even in the Vedic texts, a feminine name. In a  Vedic hymn, _Raka_, the full moon is exhorted to sew the work with a  needle that cannot be broken.[174] Here we have the moon personified  as a marvellous workwoman, a fairy with golden fingers, a good fairy;  and in this character we find her again in the _Ramayanam_, under the  form of the old _Anasuya_, who anoints the darkened Sita (for Sita,  like the Vedic girl, is dark and ugly during the night, or winter,  when she is hidden) in the wood, with a divine unguent; gives her a  garland, various ornaments, and two beauteous garments, which are  always pure (as, _i.e._, they do not touch the earth, like the cows of  the Vedic dawn, who do not cover themselves with dust), and similar in  colour to the young sun;[175] in all which the fairy moon appears as  working during the night for the aurora, preparing her luminous  garments--the two garments, of which the one is for the evening and  the other for the morning, one lunar and of silver, the other solar  and of gold--in order that she may please her husband Ramas, or the  sun Vishnus, who is glad when he sees her thus adorned. In the  _Svayamprabha_, too, we meet with the moon as a good fairy, who, from  the golden palace which she reserves for her friend Hema (the golden  one), is during a month the guide, in the vast cavern, of Hanumant and  his companions, who have lost their way in the search of the dawn  Sita. To come out of this cavern, it is necessary to shut the eyes, in  order not to see its entrance; all Hanumant's companions are come out,  but Taras, who shines like the moon,[176] would wish to return. The  same moon can be recognised in the benignant fairies _Trigata_,  _Surama_, and _Sarama_, who announce to Sita that her husband will  soon arrive, and that she will soon see him. The first, while the  arrival of Ramas is imminent, dreams that the monsters, dressed in  yellow, are playing in a lake of cow's milk;[177] at the time when  Surama announces to Sita the approach of Ramas, Sita shines by her own  beauty, like the opening dawn;[178] finally, Sarama (who seems to be  the same as Surama), whom Sita calls her twin-sister (_sahodara_),  penetrating underground, like the moon Proserpine, also announces to  Sita her approaching deliverance at the hands of Ramas.[179] As to  Trigata, it is not difficult to recognise in her the moon, when we  remember that Trgiatas is a name which is frequently given to the  evening sun, or rising moon, _Civas_, who is represented with the moon  for a diadem, whence his other name of _Candracudas_ (having the moon  for his diadem). Surama I believe to be, not a mythical, but only an  orthographical variation, and more incorrect one, of Sarama, whose  relation to the moon we shall see in detail when we come to the  chapter which treats of the mythical dog.    Thus far we have a moon fairy; but we find the moon designated at other  times in the _Ramayanam_ by its common masculine name. The guardian of  the forest of honey, _Dadhimukhas_, in which forest, with its honey, the  heroes who accompany Sita enjoy themselves, is said to be generated by  the god Lunus.[180] And the moon, who assists Hanumant in his search of  Sita, is said to shine like a white bull with a sharpened horn, with a  full horn;[181] in which we come back to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#11)"],[1,"with close-growing daisies, and the shadows of trees are long  across the grass as the sun is setting. But over all this and in the  midst of all this is agony and blood. On the roads are fugitives,  wounded soldiers, dead horses, guns, and transports.    There are fires burning on the hillsides. I saw their flames and their  great, rolling clouds of smoke rise this morning from places where the  day before I had seen French peasants plowing as though no war were  near, and young girls scattering grain over the fields harrowed by their  small brothers, and old women bending to the soil in the small  farmsteads where all their life was centred, until suddenly the  frightful truth touched them and they had to leave their homes.    Sometimes today I wished to God the sun would not shine like this nor  nature mock at me with its thrilling-beauty of life. However, the  British are full of confidence. If they were forced back they are glad  to know that they made the enemy pay heavy prices and that their line is  still unbroken. They are full of faith that against all odds they shall  hold their own in the last battle of all.      Men Utterly Weary    _Sunday, April 14._--The Commander in Chief's order of the day should  reveal to the British people and to the world what is happening out here  in France--the enemy's object to seize the Channel ports and destroy the  British Army, and the frightful forces he has brought against it to  achieve that plan, and the call that has come to the troops to hold  every position to the last man. \"Many among us now are tired. * * * With  our back to the wall each one of us must fight to the end.\"    Yes, the men are tired, so tired after weeks of fighting, after these  last days and nights, that they can hardly stagger up to resist another  attack, yet they do so because their spirit wakes again above their  bodily fatigue; so tired that they go on fighting like sleep-walkers,  and in any respite lie in ditches and under hedges and in open fields  under fire in deep slumber until the shouts of their Sergeants stir them  again. Some of these men have been fighting since March 21 with only a  few days' rest.    To people living in the villages of Flanders, from which one can see the  whole sweep of the battleline, Friday night was full of terror, and from  the windows they watched the burning of places from which they had  escaped and the bonfires of their homes, and these refugees while  sleeping with children at their breast wept.    Yesterday it was a drama of noise, beating against one's ears and  against one's heart, and it was a strange, terrible thing to stand  there, blind, as it were, listening to the infernal tumult of gunfire  south of Bailleul, with knockings and sledgehammer strokes, loud and  shocking, above the incessant drumfire of field artillery.    The German shells came howling over into fields and villages beyond  Bailleul, bursting with gruff coughs, and there was an evil snarl of  shrapnel in the mist. It was the noise of the greatest battle in  history.      Fall of Neuve Eglise    _Monday, April 15._--In the attempt to surround Bailleul two heavy  attacks were made--one on the west toward Meteren, and one on the east  at Neuve Eglise. Near Meteren the enemy failed utterly and suffered  immense losses. There has been fierce fighting around a place called the  Steam Mill, near Meteren, the enemy having been ordered to capture the  Meteren road and the high ground beyond it at whatever sacrifice. They  made the sacrifice, but did not get the ground.    Neuve Eglise, however, is now theirs. Last night the British troops who  had held it through three days and nights of intense strife withdrew,  unknown to the enemy, to a line a short distance back from the village,  in order to avoid remaining a target for unceasing shellfire.    It is now the enemy's soldiers who this morning are in the ruins under  the great bombardment. This battle at Neuve Eglise has been filled with  grim episodes, for the village changed hands several times. Each side  fought most fiercely, with any kind of weapon, small bodies of men  attacking and counterattacking among the broken walls and bits of houses  and under the stump of the church tower deathtrap, as it now is for  them. Without yielding to the direct assaults, the British obeyed  orders, stumbled out of the place, silently and unknown to the enemy,  and took up a line further back.    On the night before last the British line fell back from near La Cheche  and swung around in a loop south of Neuve Eglise toward Ravelsberg Farm.  It was then that Neuve Eglise itself became a place of hellish battle.    The enemy broke through into its ruined streets, and small parties of  Wiltshires, Worcesters, and others sprang on the Germans or were killed.  They fought desperately in backyards, over broken walls, and in  shell-pierced houses, wherever they could find Germans or hear the  tattoo of machine guns.    Several times the enemy was cleared out of most of the town, and the  British held a hollow square containing most of the streets and defended  it as a kind of fortress, though with dwindling numbers, under a heavy  fire of shells and trench mortars and machine guns.      Capture of Bailleul    _Tuesday, April 16._--It seemed inevitable after the British loss of  Neuve Eglise that the enemy should make a quick and strong effort to  capture Bailleul, and this he did last night by putting into the battle  three divisions of fresh assaulting troops not previously used, and thus  encircling that city by fierce attacks on ground southeast and east,  including the ridge of Le Ravetsberg and Mont de Lille. His troops  included his Alpine corps of Jaegers and possibly a Bavarian division  and the 117th Division. Among the men defending the city against these  heavy forces were the Staffords and Notts and Derbies.    Yesterday when I was in the country around Bailleul the enemy's guns  were working up for this new attack, and there was a continual  bombardment spreading up to Wytschaete Ridge. Heavy shells were being  flung into Bailleul itself, and the smoke of fires was rising like mist  from small towns and villages like Meteren and Morbecque down to  Merville.    The British guns were also pounding the enemy's positions, and through  that the concentrations of Germany--infantry, guns, transport, and  cavalry--were moving up the roads in and north of Merville. The enemy  must have lost severely again, for the British were stubborn in defense,  but their machine-gun fire must have been of a deadly nature owing to  their positions along the railway and on the ridge; but the enemy  advanced upon them in waves, striking upon both sides of Bailleul, so  that after great resistance the line was withdrawn beyond the town.    The capture of this city belongs to the third great attack which has  been delivered by the enemy since March 21. Always he has massed his  strength opposite the British lines and struck with full weight against  their troops. In the first phase down from St. Quentin and the Cambrai  salient the French came to their help and relieved them by their gallant  aid, but the Germans then edged away from the French to strike the  British again, this time at Arras, where they failed.    A third phase has now followed in this northern blow and once again the  British have had to sustain the abominable pressure of German divisions  constantly relieved and supported by fresh divisions passing through  them, while the British troops fight on and on, killing the enemy in  large numbers, but having to withdraw to new lines of defense. Under  these enormous odds their heroism and their sacrifices are beyond words  that may be uttered except in the silence of one's heart.      Wonderful Panorama    _Wednesday, April 17._--Yesterday morning the fortune of war seemed  again in favor of the enemy by the capture of Wytschaete Ridge down to  Spanbroekmolen and by the entry of Meteren, west of Bailleul. The  hard-pressed British troops were forced to give ground at both these  places, after a grand resistance which cost the enemy many lives, but in  the evening counterattacks hurled the enemy back from Wytschaete  village, that pile of brick dust above stumps of dead trees which were  Wytschaete Wood, and in a separate battle west of Bailluel the British  regained, at least for a time, a part of Meteren. This morning renewed  counterattacks gave them back all of Meteren and the enemy garrison  there was destroyed.    I watched the battle last night and again this morning from the centre  of the arc of fire, which was like a loop flung around from Wytschaete  to Bailleul and in a sharp curve around to Merris and the country about  Merville, so that the great gunfire and whole sweep of battle were close  about on three sides.    It was an astounding panorama of open warfare, such as I never dreamed  of seeing on this western front, where for so long both sides were  hemmed in by trenches. Bailleul was still blazing. In the early evening,  after a wet, misty day which filled all this battlefield with a whitish  fog, one could only see that city under a cloud, but as the sky darkened  and the wind blew some mist away enormous flames burned redly in the  poor dead heart of Bailleul, and in their glare there were dark masses  of walls and broken roofs outlined jaggedly by fire.    To the left the village of Locre was aflame under a storm of high  explosives, and the enemy's guns were putting heavy shells down the  roads which lead out to that place.    There were fires of burning farms and hamlets as far southward as  Merville behind one, as one stood looking out to Bailleul, and lesser  fires of single cottages and haystacks, and the wind drifted all the  smoke of them across the sky in long white ribbons.      Drumfire Rocks Earth    It was just before dusk when the counterattacks began northward from  Wytschaete and southward from Meteren,"]]]
