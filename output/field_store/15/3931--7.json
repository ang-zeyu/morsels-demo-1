The fact, therefore, that things often fail  to fulfil our expectations is no evidence that our expectations will not  _probably_ be fulfilled in a given case or a given class of cases. Thus  our inductive principle is at any rate not capable of being _disproved_  by an appeal to experience.    The inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being _proved_  by an appeal to experience. Experience might conceivably confirm  the inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already  examined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle  alone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what  has not been examined. All arguments which, on the basis of experience,  argue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or  present, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use  experience to prove the inductive principle without begging the  question. Thus we must either accept the inductive principle on the  ground of its intrinsic evidence, or forgo all justification of our  expectations about the future. If the principle is unsound, we have no  reason to expect the sun to rise to-morrow, to expect bread to be more  nourishing than a stone, or to expect that if we throw ourselves off  the roof we shall fall. When we see what looks like our best friend  approaching us, we shall have no reason to suppose that his body is not  inhabited by the mind of our worst enemy or of some total stranger. All  our conduct is based upon associations which have worked in the past,  and which we therefore regard as likely to work in the future; and this  likelihood is dependent for its validity upon the inductive principle.    The general principles of science, such as the belief in the reign  of law, and the belief that every event must have a cause, are as  completely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of  daily life All such general principles are believed because mankind have  found innumerable instances of their truth and no instances of their  falsehood. But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future,  unless the inductive principle is assumed.    Thus all knowledge which, on a basis of experience tells us something  about what is not experienced, is based upon a belief which experience  can neither confirm nor confute, yet which, at least in its more  concrete applications, appears to be as firmly rooted in us as many  of the facts of experience. The existence and justification of such  beliefs--for the inductive principle, as we shall see, is not the only  example--raises some of the most difficult and most debated problems of  philosophy. We will, in the next chapter, consider briefly what may be  said to account for such knowledge, and what is its scope and its degree  of certainty.        CHAPTER VII. ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES    We saw in the preceding chapter that the principle of induction, while  necessary to the validity of all arguments based on experience,  is itself not capable of being proved by experience, and yet is  unhesitatingly believed by every one, at least in all its concrete  applications. In these characteristics the principle of induction does  not stand alone. There are a number of other principles which cannot be  proved or disproved by experience, but are used in arguments which start  from what is experienced.    Some of these principles have even greater evidence than the principle  of induction, and the knowledge of them has the same degree of certainty  as the knowledge of the existence of sense-data. They constitute the  means of drawing inferences from what is given in sensation; and if what  we infer is to be true, it is just as necessary that our principles  of inference should be true as it is that our data should be true. The  principles of inference are apt to be overlooked because of their  very obviousness--the assumption involved is assented to without our  realizing that it is an assumption. But it is very important to realize  the use of principles of inference, if a correct theory of knowledge  is to be obtained; for our knowledge of them raises interesting and  difficult questions.    In all our knowledge of general principles, what actually happens  is that first of all we realize some particular application of the  principle, and then we realize that the particularity is irrelevant, and  that there is a generality which may equally truly be affirmed. This is  of course familiar in such matters as teaching arithmetic: 'two and  two are four' is first learnt in the case of some particular pair of  couples, and then in some other particular case, and so on, until at  last it becomes possible to see that it is true of any pair of couples.  The same thing happens with logical principles. Suppose two men are  discussing what day of the month it is. One of them says, 'At least you  will admit that _if_ yesterday was the 15th to-day must be the 16th.'  'Yes', says the other, 'I admit that.' 'And you know', the first  continues, 'that yesterday was the 15th, because you dined with Jones,  and your diary will tell you that was on the 15th.' 'Yes', says the  second; 'therefore to-day _is_ the 16th.'    Now such an argument is not hard to follow; and if it is granted that  its premisses are true in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion  must also be true. But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a  general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose  it known that _if_ this is true, then that is true. Suppose it also  known that this _is_ true, then it follows that that is true.' When it  is the case that if this is true, that is true, we shall say that this  'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle  states that if this implies that, and this is true, then that is true.  In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or  'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.    This principle is really involved--at least, concrete instances of it  are involved--in all demonstrations. Whenever one thing which we believe  is used to prove something else, which we consequently believe, this  principle is relevant. If any one asks: 'Why should I accept the results  of valid arguments based on true premisses?' we can only answer by  appealing to our principle. In fact, the truth of the principle is  impossible to doubt, and its obviousness is so great that at first sight  it seems almost trivial. Such principles, however, are not trivial to  the philosopher, for they show that we may have indubitable knowledge  which is in no way derived from objects of sense.    The above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident  logical principles. Some at least of these principles must be granted  before any argument or proof becomes possible. When some of them have  been granted, others can be proved, though these others, so long as they  are simple, are just as obvious as the principles taken for granted. For  no very good reason, three of these principles have been singled out by  tradition under the name of 'Laws of Thought'.    They are as follows:    (1) _The law of identity_: 'Whatever is, is.'    (2) _The law of contradiction_: 'Nothing can both be and not be.'    (3) _The law of excluded middle_: 'Everything must either be or not be.'    These three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles, but  are not really more fundamental or more self-evident than various other  similar principles: for instance, the one we considered just now, which  states that what follows from a true premiss is true. The name 'laws of  thought' is also misleading, for what is important is not the fact that  we think in accordance with these laws, but the fact that things behave  in accordance with them; in other words, the fact that when we think in  accordance with them we think _truly_. But this is a large question, to  which we must return at a later stage.    In addition to the logical principles which enable us to prove from  a given premiss that something is _certainly_ true, there are other  logical principles which enable us to prove, from a given premiss,  that there is a greater or less probability that something is true. An  example of such principles--perhaps the most important example is the  inductive principle, which we considered in the preceding chapter.    One of the great historic controversies in philosophy is the controversy  between the two schools called respectively 'empiricists' and  'rationalists'. The empiricists--who are best represented by the  British philosophers, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume--maintained that all  our knowledge is derived from experience; the rationalists--who are  represented by the Continental philosophers of the seventeenth century,  especially Descartes and Leibniz--maintained that, in addition to what  we know by experience, there are certain 'innate ideas' and 'innate  principles', which we know independently of experience. It has now  become possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or  falsehood of these opposing schools. It must be admitted, for the  reasons already stated, that logical principles are known to us, and  cannot be themselves proved by experience, since all proof presupposes  them. In this, therefore, which was the most important point of the  controversy, the rationalists were in the right.    On the other hand, even that part of our knowledge which is _logically_  independent of experience (in the sense that experience cannot prove  it) is yet elicited and caused by experience. It is on occasion of  particular experiences that we become aware of the general laws which  their connexions exemplify. It would certainly be absurd to suppose that  there are innate principles in the sense that babies are born with a  knowledge of everything which men know and which cannot be deduced from  what is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],[0,"The Woman in White (#11)"],[1,"spring to life in  most of our hearts, die again in so many, and renew their bright  existence in so few--there was one that troubled and perplexed me: one  that seemed strangely inconsistent and unaccountably out of place in  Miss Fairlie's presence.    Mingling with the vivid impression produced by the charm of her fair  face and head, her sweet expression, and her winning simplicity of  manner, was another impression, which, in a shadowy way, suggested to  me the idea of something wanting.  At one time it seemed like something  wanting in HER: at another, like something wanting in myself, which  hindered me from understanding her as I ought.  The impression was  always strongest in the most contradictory manner, when she looked at  me; or, in other words, when I was most conscious of the harmony and  charm of her face, and yet, at the same time, most troubled by the  sense of an incompleteness which it was impossible to discover.  Something wanting, something wanting--and where it was, and what it  was, I could not say.    The effect of this curious caprice of fancy (as I thought it then) was  not of a nature to set me at my ease, during a first interview with  Miss Fairlie.  The few kind words of welcome which she spoke found me  hardly self-possessed enough to thank her in the customary phrases of  reply.  Observing my hesitation, and no doubt attributing it, naturally  enough, to some momentary shyness on my part, Miss Halcombe took the  business of talking, as easily and readily as usual, into her own hands.    \"Look there, Mr. Hartright,\" she said, pointing to the sketch-book on  the table, and to the little delicate wandering hand that was still  trifling with it.  \"Surely you will acknowledge that your model pupil  is found at last? The moment she hears that you are in the house, she  seizes her inestimable sketch-book, looks universal Nature straight in  the face, and longs to begin!\"    Miss Fairlie laughed with a ready good-humour, which broke out as  brightly as if it had been part of the sunshine above us, over her  lovely face.    \"I must not take credit to myself where no credit is due,\" she said,  her clear, truthful blue eyes looking alternately at Miss Halcombe and  at me.  \"Fond as I am of drawing, I am so conscious of my own ignorance  that I am more afraid than anxious to begin. Now I know you are here,  Mr. Hartright, I find myself looking over my sketches, as I used to  look over my lessons when I was a little girl, and when I was sadly  afraid that I should turn out not fit to be heard.\"    She made the confession very prettily and simply, and, with quaint,  childish earnestness, drew the sketch-book away close to her own side  of the table.  Miss Halcombe cut the knot of the little embarrassment  forthwith, in her resolute, downright way.    \"Good, bad, or indifferent,\" she said, \"the pupil's sketches must pass  through the fiery ordeal of the master's judgment--and there's an end  of it.  Suppose we take them with us in the carriage, Laura, and let  Mr. Hartright see them, for the first time, under circumstances of  perpetual jolting and interruption? If we can only confuse him all  through the drive, between Nature as it is, when he looks up at the  view, and Nature as it is not when he looks down again at our  sketch-books, we shall drive him into the last desperate refuge of  paying us compliments, and shall slip through his professional fingers  with our pet feathers of vanity all unruffled.\"    \"I hope Mr. Hartright will pay ME no compliments,\" said Miss Fairlie,  as we all left the summer-house.    \"May I venture to inquire why you express that hope?\" I asked.    \"Because I shall believe all that you say to me,\" she answered simply.    In those few words she unconsciously gave me the key to her whole  character: to that generous trust in others which, in her nature, grew  innocently out of the sense of her own truth.  I only knew it  intuitively then.  I know it by experience now.    We merely waited to rouse good Mrs. Vesey from the place which she  still occupied at the deserted luncheon-table, before we entered the  open carriage for our promised drive.  The old lady and Miss Halcombe  occupied the back seat, and Miss Fairlie and I sat together in front,  with the sketch-book open between us, fairly exhibited at last to my  professional eyes.  All serious criticism on the drawings, even if I  had been disposed to volunteer it, was rendered impossible by Miss  Halcombe's lively resolution to see nothing but the ridiculous side of  the Fine Arts, as practised by herself, her sister, and ladies in  general.  I can remember the conversation that passed far more easily  than the sketches that I mechanically looked over.  That part of the  talk, especially, in which Miss Fairlie took any share, is still as  vividly impressed on my memory as if I had heard it only a few hours  ago.    Yes! let me acknowledge that on this first day I let the charm of her  presence lure me from the recollection of myself and my position.  The  most trifling of the questions that she put to me, on the subject of  using her pencil and mixing her colours; the slightest alterations of  expression in the lovely eyes that looked into mine with such an  earnest desire to learn all that I could teach, and to discover all  that I could show, attracted more of my attention than the finest view  we passed through, or the grandest changes of light and shade, as they  flowed into each other over the waving moorland and the level beach.  At any time, and under any circumstances of human interest, is it not  strange to see how little real hold the objects of the natural world  amid which we live can gain on our hearts and minds? We go to Nature  for comfort in trouble, and sympathy in joy, only in books.  Admiration  of those beauties of the inanimate world, which modern poetry so  largely and so eloquently describes, is not, even in the best of us,  one of the original instincts of our nature.  As children, we none of  us possess it.  No uninstructed man or woman possesses it. Those whose  lives are most exclusively passed amid the ever-changing wonders of sea  and land are also those who are most universally insensible to every  aspect of Nature not directly associated with the human interest of  their calling.  Our capacity of appreciating the beauties of the earth  we live on is, in truth, one of the civilised accomplishments which we  all learn as an Art; and, more, that very capacity is rarely practised  by any of us except when our minds are most indolent and most  unoccupied.  How much share have the attractions of Nature ever had in  the pleasurable or painful interests and emotions of ourselves or our  friends? What space do they ever occupy in the thousand little  narratives of personal experience which pass every day by word of mouth  from one of us to the other? All that our minds can compass, all that  our hearts can learn, can be accomplished with equal certainty, equal  profit, and equal satisfaction to ourselves, in the poorest as in the  richest prospect that the face of the earth can show.  There is surely  a reason for this want of inborn sympathy between the creature and the  creation around it, a reason which may perhaps be found in the  widely-differing destinies of man and his earthly sphere.  The grandest  mountain prospect that the eye can range over is appointed to  annihilation.  The smallest human interest that the pure heart can feel  is appointed to immortality.    We had been out nearly three hours, when the carriage again passed  through the gates of Limmeridge House.    On our way back I had let the ladies settle for themselves the first  point of view which they were to sketch, under my instructions, on the  afternoon of the next day.  When they withdrew to dress for dinner, and  when I was alone again in my little sitting-room, my spirits seemed to  leave me on a sudden.  I felt ill at ease and dissatisfied with myself,  I hardly knew why. Perhaps I was now conscious for the first time of  having enjoyed our drive too much in the character of a guest, and too  little in the character of a drawing-master.  Perhaps that strange  sense of something wanting, either in Miss Fairlie or in myself, which  had perplexed me when I was first introduced to her, haunted me still.  Anyhow, it was a relief to my spirits when the dinner-hour called me  out of my solitude, and took me back to the society of the ladies of  the house.    I was struck, on entering the drawing-room, by the curious contrast,  rather in material than in colour, of the dresses which they now wore.  While Mrs. Vesey and Miss Halcombe were richly clad (each in the manner  most becoming to her age), the first in silver-grey, and the second in  that delicate primrose-yellow colour which matches so well with a dark  complexion and black hair, Miss Fairlie was unpretendingly and almost  poorly dressed in plain white muslin.  It was spotlessly pure: it was  beautifully put on; but still it was the sort of dress which the wife  or daughter of a poor man might have worn, and it made her, so far as  externals went, look less affluent in circumstances than her own  governess.  At a later period, when I learnt to know more of Miss  Fairlie's character, I discovered that this curious contrast, on the  wrong side, was due to her natural delicacy of feeling and natural  intensity of aversion to the slightest personal display of her own  wealth.  Neither Mrs. Vesey nor Miss Halcombe could ever induce her to  let the advantage in dress desert the two ladies who were poor, to lean  to the side of the one lady who was rich.    When the dinner was over we returned together to the drawing-room.  Although Mr. Fairlie (emulating the magnificent condescension of the  monarch who had picked up Titian's brush for him) had instructed his  butler to consult my wishes in relation to the wine that I might prefer  after dinner, I was"]]]
