Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons (#11)"],[1,"ackground, too, was a different one from what I had planned for her:  the black outline of her profile against the sky was bordered all  round by stars studded in the sky, and all her funnels and masts were  picked out in the same way: her bulk was seen where the stars were  blotted out. And one other thing was different from expectation: the  thing that ripped away from us instantly, as we saw it, all sense of  the beauty of the night, the beauty of the ship's lines, and the  beauty of her lights,--and all these taken in themselves were  intensely beautiful,--that thing was the awful angle made by the level  of the sea with the rows of porthole lights along her side in dotted  lines, row above row. The sea level and the rows of lights should have  been parallel--should never have met--and now they met at an angle  inside the black hull of the ship. There was nothing else to indicate  she was injured; nothing but this apparent violation of a simple  geometrical law--that parallel lines should \"never meet even if  produced ever so far both ways\"; but it meant the Titanic had sunk by  the head until the lowest portholes in the bows were under the sea,  and the portholes in the stern were lifted above the normal height. We  rowed away from her in the quietness of the night, hoping and praying  with all our hearts that she would sink no more and the day would find  her still in the same position as she was then. The crew, however, did  not think so. It has been said frequently that the officers and crew  felt assured that she would remain afloat even after they knew the  extent of the damage. Some of them may have done so--and perhaps, from  their scientific knowledge of her construction, with more reason at  the time than those who said she would sink--but at any rate the  stokers in our boat had no such illusion. One of them--I think he was  the same man that cut us free from the pulley ropes--told us how he  was at work in the stoke-hole, and in anticipation of going off duty  in quarter of an hour,--thus confirming the time of the collision as  11.45,--had near him a pan of soup keeping hot on some part of the  machinery; suddenly the whole side of the compartment came in, and the  water rushed him off his feet. Picking himself up, he sprang for the  compartment doorway and was just through the aperture when the  watertight door came down behind him, \"like a knife,\" as he said;  \"they work them from the bridge.\" He had gone up on deck but was  ordered down again at once and with others was told to draw the fires  from under the boiler, which they did, and were then at liberty to  come on deck again. It seems that this particular knot of stokers must  have known almost as soon as any one of the extent of injury. He added  mournfully, \"I could do with that hot soup now\"--and indeed he could:  he was clad at the time of the collision, he said, in trousers and  singlet, both very thin on account of the intense heat in the  stoke-hole; and although he had added a short jacket later, his teeth  were chattering with the cold. He found a place to lie down underneath  the tiller on the little platform where our captain stood, and there  he lay all night with a coat belonging to another stoker thrown over  him and I think he must have been almost unconscious. A lady next to  him, who was warmly clad with several coats, tried to insist on his  having one of hers--a fur-lined one--thrown over him, but he  absolutely refused while some of the women were insufficiently clad;  and so the coat was given to an Irish girl with pretty auburn hair  standing near, leaning against the gunwale--with an \"outside berth\"  and so more exposed to the cold air. This same lady was able to  distribute more of her wraps to the passengers, a rug to one, a fur  boa to another; and she has related with amusement that at the moment  of climbing up the Carpathia's side, those to whom these articles had  been lent offered them all back to her; but as, like the rest of us,  she was encumbered with a lifebelt, she had to say she would receive  them back at the end of the climb, I had not seen my dressing-gown  since I dropped into the boat, but some time in the night a steerage  passenger found it on the floor and put it on.    It is not easy at this time to call to mind who were in the boat,  because in the night it was not possible to see more than a few feet  away, and when dawn came we had eyes only for the rescue ship and the  icebergs; but so far as my memory serves the list was as follows: no  first-class passengers; three women, one baby, two men from the second  cabin; and the other passengers steerage--mostly women; a total of  about 35 passengers. The rest, about 25 (and possibly more), were crew  and stokers. Near to me all night was a group of three Swedish girls,  warmly clad, standing close together to keep warm, and very silent;  indeed there was very little talking at any time.    One conversation took place that is, I think, worth repeating: one  more proof that the world after all is a small place. The ten months'  old baby which was handed down at the last moment was received by a  lady next to me--the same who shared her wraps and coats. The mother  had found a place in the middle and was too tightly packed to come  through to the child, and so it slept contentedly for about an hour in  a stranger's arms; it then began to cry and the temporary nurse said:  \"Will you feel down and see if the baby's feet are out of the blanket!  I don't know much about babies but I think their feet must be kept  warm.\" Wriggling down as well as I could, I found its toes exposed to  the air and wrapped them well up, when it ceased crying at once: it  was evidently a successful diagnosis! Having recognized the lady by  her voice,--it was much too dark to see faces,--as one of my vis-a-vis  at the purser's table, I said,--\"Surely you are Miss ----?\" \"Yes,\"  she replied, \"and you must be Mr. Beesley; how curious we should find  ourselves in the same boat!\" Remembering that she had joined the boat  at Queenstown, I said, \"Do you know Clonmel? a letter from a great  friend of mine who is staying there at ---- [giving the address] came  aboard at Queenstown.\" \"Yes, it is my home: and I was dining  at ---- just before I came away.\" It seemed that she knew my friend,  too; and we agreed that of all places in the world to recognize mutual  friends, a crowded lifeboat afloat in mid-ocean at 2 A.M. twelve  hundred miles from our destination was one of the most unexpected.    And all the time, as we watched, the Titanic sank lower and lower by  the head and the angle became wider and wider as the stern porthole  lights lifted and the bow lights sank, and it was evident she was not  to stay afloat much longer. The captain-stoker now told the oarsmen to  row away as hard as they could. Two reasons seemed to make this a wise  decision: one that as she sank she would create such a wave of suction  that boats, if not sucked under by being too near, would be in danger  of being swamped by the wave her sinking would create--and we all knew  our boat was in no condition to ride big waves, crowded as it was and  manned with untrained oarsmen. The second was that an explosion might  result from the water getting to the boilers, and debris might fall  within a wide radius. And yet, as it turned out, neither of these  things happened.    At about 2.15 A.M. I think we were any distance from a mile to two  miles away. It is difficult for a landsman to calculate distance at  sea but we had been afloat an hour and a half, the boat was heavily  loaded, the oarsmen unskilled, and our course erratic: following now  one light and now another, sometimes a star and sometimes a light from  a port lifeboat which had turned away from the Titanic in the opposite  direction and lay almost on our horizon; and so we could not have gone  very far away.    About this time, the water had crept up almost to her sidelight and  the captain's bridge, and it seemed a question only of minutes before  she sank. The oarsmen lay on their oars, and all in the lifeboat were  motionless as we watched her in absolute silence--save some who would  not look and buried their heads on each others' shoulders. The lights  still shone with the same brilliance, but not so many of them: many  were now below the surface. I have often wondered since whether they  continued to light up the cabins when the portholes were under water;  they may have done so.    And then, as we gazed awe-struck, she tilted slowly up, revolving  apparently about a centre of gravity just astern of amidships, until  she attained a vertically upright position; and there she  remained--motionless! As she swung up, her lights, which had shone  without a flicker all night, went out suddenly, came on again for a  single flash, then went out altogether. And as they did so, there came  a noise which many people, wrongly I think, have described as an  explosion; it has always seemed to me that it was nothing but the  engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and  falling through the compartments, smashing everything in their way. It  was partly a roar, partly a groan, partly a rattle, and partly a  smash, and it was not a sudden roar as an explosion would be: it went  on successively for some seconds, possibly fifteen to twenty, as the  heavy machinery dropped down to the bottom (now the bows) of the ship:  I suppose it fell through the end and sank first, before the ship. But  it was a noise no one had heard before, and no one wishes to hear  again: it was stupefying, stupendous, as it came to us along the  water. It was as if all the heavy things one could think of had been  thrown downstairs from the top of a house, smashing each other and the  stairs and everything in the way. Several apparently authentic  accounts have been given, in which definite stories of explosions have  been related--in some cases even with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],[0,"Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#11)"],[1,"a jelly bag, set a deep dish or pan under it, and squeeze out  the juice.    To every pint of juice, allow a pound of loaf-sugar, broken up,  and the juice of two lemons. Put the apple-juice, the sugar, and  the lemon-juice into the preserving kettle. Boil it twenty  minutes, skimming it well. Take it immediately from the kettle,  and pour it warm into your glasses, but not so hot as to break  them. When cold, cover each glass with white paper dipped in  brandy, and tie it down tight with another paper. Keep them in a  cool place.    Quince Jelly is made in the same manner, but do not pare the  quinces. Quarter them only.      RED CURRANT JELLY.    Wash your currants, drain them, and pick them from the stalks.  Mash them with the back of a spoon. Put them in a jelly-bag, and  squeeze it till all the juice is pressed out.    To every pint of juice, allow a pound of the best loaf-sugar. Put  the juice and the sugar into your kettle, and boil them twenty  minutes, skimming all the while. Pour it warm into your glasses,  and when cold, tie it up with brandy paper. Jellies should never  be allowed to get cold in the kettle. If boiled too long, they  will lose their flavour, and become of a dark colour.    Strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, and grape jelly may be made in  the same manner, and with the same proportion of loaf-sugar.    Red currant jelly may also be made in a very simple manner, by  putting the currants whole into the kettle, with the sugar;  allowing a pound of sugar to a pound of currants. Boil them  together twenty minutes, skimming carefully. Then pour them into a  sieve, with a pan under it. Let them drain through the sieve into  the pan, pressing them down with the back of a spoon.    Take the jelly, while warm, out of the pan, and put it into your  glasses. Tie it up with brandy paper when cold.      BLACK CURRANT JELLY.    Pick the currants from the stalks, wash and drain them. Mash them  soft with a spoon, put them in a bag, and squeeze out the juice.  To each pint of juice, allow three quarters of a pound of  loaf-sugar, Put the juice and sugar into a preserving kettle, and  boil them about ten minutes, skimming them well. Take it  immediately out of the kettle. Put it warm into your glasses. Tie  it up with brandy paper.    The juice of black currants is so very thick, that it requires  less sugar and less boiling than any other jelly.      GOOSEBERRY JELLY    Cut the gooseberries in half, (they must be green) and put them in  a jar closely covered. Set the jar in an oven, or pot filled with  boiling water. Keep the water boiling round the jar till the  gooseberries are soft, take them out, mash them with a spoon, and  put them into a jelly bag to drain. When all the juice is squeezed  out, measure it, and to a pint of juice, allow a pound of  loaf-sugar. Put the juice and sugar into the preserving kettle,  and boil them twenty minutes, skimming carefully. Put the jelly  warm into your glasses. Tie them up with brandy paper.    Cranberry jelly is made in the same manner.      GRAPE JELLY.    Pick the grapes from the stems, wash and drain them. Mash them  with a spoon. Put them in the preserving kettle, and cover them  closely with a large plate. Boil them ten minutes. Then pour them  into your jelly bag, and squeeze out the juice.    Allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar. Put the sugar and juice  into your kettle, and boil them twenty minutes, skimming them  well.    Fill your glasses while the jelly is warm, and tie them up with  brandy papers.      PEACH JELLY    Wipe the wool off your peaches, (which should be free-stones and  not too ripe) and cut them in quarters, Crack the stones, and  break the kernels small.    Put the peaches and the kernels into a covered jar, set them in  boiling water, and let them boil till they are soft.    Strain them through a jelly-bag, till all the juice is squeezed  out. Allow a pound of loaf-sugar to a pint of juice. Put the sugar  and juice into a preserving kettle, and boil them twenty minutes,  skimming carefully.    Put the jelly warm into your glasses, and when cold, tie them up  with brandy paper.    Plum, and green-gage jelly may be made in the same manner, with  the kernels, which greatly improve the flavour.      PRESERVED QUINCES    Pare and core your quinces, carefully taking out the parts that  are knotty and defective. Cut them into quarters, or into round  slices. Put them into a preserving kettle and cover them with the  parings and a very little water. Lay a large plate over them to  keep in the steam, and boil them till they are tender.    Take out the quinces, and strain the liquor through a bag. To  every pint of liquor, allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Boil the juice  and sugar together, about ten minutes, skimming it well. Then put  in the quinces, and boil them gently twenty minutes. When the  sugar seems to have completely penetrated them, take them out, put  them in a glass jar, and pour the juice over them warm. Tie them  up, when cold, with brandy paper.    In preserving fruit that is boiled first without the sugar, it is  generally better (after the first boiling) to let it stand till  next day before you put the sugar to it.      PRESERVED PIPPINS.    Pare and core some of the largest and finest pippins. Put them in  your preserving kettle, [Footnote: The use of brass or bell-metal  kettles is now most entirely superseded by the enamelled kettles  of iron lined with china, called preserving kettles; brass and  bell-metal having always been objectionable on account of the  verdigris which collects in them.] with some lemon-peel, and all  the apple-parings. Add a very little water, and cover them  closely. Boil them till they are tender, taking care they do not  burn. Take out the apples, and spread them on a large dish to  cool. Poor the liquor into a bag, and strain it well. Put it into  your kettle with a pound of loaf-sugar to each pint of juice, and  add lemon juice to your taste. Boil it five minutes, skimming it  well. Then put in the whole apples, and boil them slowly half an  hour, or till they are quite soft and clear. Put them with the  juice, into your jars, and when quite cold, tie them up with  brandy paper.    Preserved apples are only intended for present use, as they will  not keep long.    Pears may be done in the same way, either whole or cut in half.  They may be flavoured either with lemon or cinnamon, or both. The  pears for preserving should be green.      PRESERVED PEACHES.    Take the largest and finest free-stone peaches, before they are  too ripe. Pare them, and cut them in halves or in quarters. Crack  the stones, and take out the kernels, and break them in pieces.  Put the peaches, with the parings and kernels, into your  preserving kettle, with a very little water. Boil them till they  are tender. Take out the peaches and spread them on a large dish  to cool. Strain the liquor through a bag or sieve. Next day,  measure the juice, and to each pint allow a pound of loaf-sugar.  Put the juice and sugar into the kettle with the peaches, and boil  them slowly half an hour, or till they are quite soft, skimming  all the time. Take the peaches out, put them into your jars, and  pour the warm liquor over them. When cold, tie them up with brandy  paper.    If boiled too long, they will look dull, and be of a dark colour.  [Footnote: To preserve peaches whole, pare them and thrust out the  stones with a skewer. Then proceed as above, only blanch the  kernels and keep them whole. When the peaches are done, stick a  kernel into the hole of every peach, before you put them into the  jars. Large fruit will keep best in broad shallow stone pots.]    If you do not wish the juice to be very thick, do not put it on to  boil with the sugar, but first boil the sugar alone, with only as  much water as will dissolve it, and skim it well. Let the sugar,  in all cases, be entirely melted before it goes on the fire.  Having boiled the sugar and water, and skimmed it to a clear  syrup, then put in your juice and fruit together, and boil them  till completely penetrated with the sugar.      PRESERVED CRAB APPLES    Wash your fruit. Cover the bottom of your preserving kettle with  grape leaves. Put in the apples. Hang them over the fire, with a  very little water, and cover them closely. Do not allow them to  boil, but let them simmer gently till they are yellow. Take them  out, and spread them on a large dish to cool. Pare and core them.  Put them again into the kettle, with fresh vine-leaves under and  over them, and a very little water. Hang them over the fire till  they are green. Do not let them boil.    Take them out, weigh them, and allow a pound of loaf-sugar to a  pound of crab-apples. Put to the sugar just water enough to  dissolve it. When it is all melted, put it on the fire, and boil  and skim it. Then put in your fruit, and boil the apples till they  are quite clear and soft. Put them in jars, and pour the warm  liquor over them. When cold, tie them up with brandy paper.      PRESERVED PLUMS.    Cut your plums in half, (they must not be quite ripe,) and take am  the stones. Weigh the plums and allow a pound of loaf-sugar to a  pound of fruit.    Crack the stones, take out the kernels and break them in pieces.  Boil the plums and kernels very slowly for about fifteen minutes,  in as little water as possible. Then spread them on a large dish  to cool, and strain the liquor.    Next day make your syrup. Melt the sugar in as little water as  will suffice to dissolve it, (about half a pint of water to a  pound of sugar) and boil it a few minutes, skimming it till quite  clear. Then put in your plums with the liquor, and boil them  fifteen minutes. Put them in jars, pour the juice over them warm,  and tie them up, when cold, with brandy paper. [Footnote: Plums  for common use, are very good done in molasses. Put your plums  into an earthen vessel that holds a gallon, having first slit each  plum with a knife. To "]]]
