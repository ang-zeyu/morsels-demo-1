He deserves half the praise, for this is the second time he has  caught a thief.\"    So Cocky was brought in, and petted, and called a fine fellow; and his  family were so proud of him they clucked about it for weeks afterward.    When the robbers were tried, it was found that they were the men who had  robbed the bank, and taken a great deal of money; so every one was glad  to have them shut up for twenty years. It made a great stir, and people  would go to see Cocky and tell how he helped catch the men; and he was  so brave and handsome, they said at last,--    \"We want a new weather-cock on our court-house, and instead of an arrow  let us have a cock; and he shall look like this fine fellow.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried the young folks, much pleased; for they thought Cocky  ought to be remembered in some way.    So a picture was taken, and Cocky stood very still, with his bright eye  on the man; then one like it was made of brass, and put high up on the  court-house, where all could see the splendid bird shining like gold,  and twirling about to tell which way the wind was. The children were  never tired of admiring him; and all the hens and chickens went in a  procession one moonlight night to see it,--yes, even Mamma Partlet and  Granny Cockletop, though one was lame and the other very old, so full of  pride were they in the great honor done King Cockyloo.    This was not the end of his good deeds; and the last was the best of  all, though it cost him his life. He ruled for some years, and kept his  kingdom in good order; for no one would kill him, when many of the other  fowls were taken for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. But he did die  at last; and even then he was good and brave, as you shall hear.    One of the boys wanted to smoke a pipe, and went behind the hen-house,  so nobody should see him do such a silly thing. He thought he heard  his father coming, and hid the pipe under the house. Some straw and dry  leaves lay about, and took fire, setting the place in a blaze; for the  boy ran away when he saw the mischief he had done, and the fire got to  burning nicely before the cries of the poor hens called people to help.  The door was locked, and could not be opened, because the key was in the  pocket of the naughty boy; so the farmer got an axe and chopped down the  wall, letting the poor biddies fly out, squawking and smoking.    \"Where is Cocky?\" cried the other boy, as he counted the hens and missed  the king of the farmyard.    \"Burnt up, I'm afraid,\" said the farmer, who was throwing water on the  flames.    Alas! yes, he was: for when the fire was out they found good old Cocky  sitting on a nest, with his wide wings spread over some little chicks  whose mother had left them. They were too small to run away, and sat  chirping sadly till Cocky covered and kept them safe, though the smoke  choked _him_ to death.    Every one was very sorry; and the children gave the good bird a fine  funeral, and buried him in the middle of the field, with a green mound  over him, and a white stone, on which was written,--      Here lies the bravest cock that ever crew:    We mourn for him with sorrow true.    Now nevermore at dawn his music shall we hear,    Waking the world like trumpet shrill and clear.    The hens all hang their heads, the chickens sadly peep;    The boys look sober, and the girls all weep.    Good-by, dear Cocky: sleep and rest,    With grass and daisies on your faithful breast;    And when you wake, brave bird, so good and true,    Clap your white wings and crow, \"Cock-a-doodle-doo.\"      [Illustration: The lion walked awhile to rest himself.]          VI.    ROSY'S JOURNEY.      Rosy was a nice little girl who lived with her mother in a small house  in the woods. They were very poor, for the father had gone away to dig  gold, and did not come back; so they had to work hard to get food to eat  and clothes to wear. The mother spun yarn when she was able, for she was  often sick, and Rosy did all she could to help. She milked the red cow  and fed the hens; dug the garden, and went to town to sell the yarn and  the eggs.    She was very good and sweet, and every one loved her; but the neighbors  were all poor, and could do little to help the child. So, when at last  the mother died, the cow and hens and house had to be sold to pay the  doctor and the debts. Then Rosy was left all alone, with no mother, no  home, and no money to buy clothes and dinners with.    \"What will you do?\" said the people, who were very sorry for her.    \"I will go and find my father,\" answered Rosy, bravely.    \"But he is far away, and you don't know just where he is, up among the  mountains. Stay with us and spin on your little wheel, and we will buy  the yarn, and take care of you, dear little girl,\" said the kind people.    \"No, I must go; for mother told me to, and my father will be glad  to have me. I'm not afraid, for every one is good to me,\" said Rosy,  gratefully.    Then the people gave her a warm red cloak, and a basket with a little  loaf and bottle of milk in it, and some pennies to buy more to eat when  the bread was gone. They all kissed her, and wished her good luck; and  she trotted away through the wood to find her father.    For some days she got on very well; for the wood-cutters were kind, and  let her sleep in their huts, and gave her things to eat. But by and by  she came to lonely places, where there were no houses; and then she  was afraid, and used to climb up in the trees to sleep, and had to eat  berries and leaves, like the Children in the Wood.    She made a fire at night, so wild beasts would not come near her; and if  she met other travellers, she was so young and innocent no one had the  heart to hurt her. She was kind to everything she met; so all little  creatures were friends to her, as we shall see.    One day, as she was resting by a river, she saw a tiny fish on the bank,  nearly dead for want of water.    \"Poor thing! go and be happy again,\" she said, softly taking him up, and  dropping him into the nice cool river.    \"Thank you, dear child; I'll not forget, but will help you some day,\"  said the fish, when he had taken a good drink, and felt better.    \"Why, how can a tiny fish help such a great girl as I am?\" laughed Rosy.    \"Wait and see,\" answered the fish, as he swam away with a flap of his  little tail.    Rosy went on her way, and forgot all about it. But she never forgot  to be kind; and soon after, as she was looking in the grass for  strawberries, she found a field-mouse with a broken leg.    \"Help me to my nest, or my babies will starve,\" cried the poor thing.    \"Yes, I will; and bring these berries so that you can keep still till  your leg is better, and have something to eat.\"    Rosy took the mouse carefully in her little hand, and tied up the broken  leg with a leaf of spearmint and a blade of grass. Then she carried her  to the nest under the roots of an old tree, where four baby mice were  squeaking sadly for their mother. She made a bed of thistledown for the  sick mouse, and put close within reach all the berries and seeds she  could find, and brought an acorn-cup of water from the spring, so they  could be comfortable.    \"Good little Rosy, I shall pay you for all this kindness some day,\" said  the mouse, when she was done.    \"I'm afraid you are not big enough to do much,\" answered Rosy, as she  ran off to go on her journey.    \"Wait and see,\" called the mouse; and all the little ones squeaked, as  if they said the same.    Some time after, as Rosy lay up in a tree, waiting for the sun to rise,  she heard a great buzzing close by, and saw a fly caught in a cobweb  that went from one twig to another. The big spider was trying to spin  him all up, and the poor fly was struggling to get away before his legs  and wings were helpless.    Rosy put up her finger and pulled down the web, and the spider ran away  at once to hide under the leaves. But the happy fly sat on Rosy's hand,  cleaning his wings, and buzzing so loud for joy that it sounded like a  little trumpet.    \"You've saved my life, and I'll save yours, if I can,\" said the fly,  twinkling his bright eye at Rosy.    \"You silly thing, you can't help me,\" answered Rosy, climbing down,  while the fly buzzed away, saying, like the mouse and fish,--    \"Wait and see; wait and see.\"    Rosy trudged on and on, till at last she came to the sea. The mountains  were on the other side; but how should she get over the wide water? No  ships were there, and she had no money to hire one if there had been  any; so she sat on the shore, very tired and sad, and cried a few big  tears as salt as the sea.    \"Hullo!\" called a bubbly sort of voice close by; and the fish popped up  his head. Rosy ran to see what he wanted.    \"I've come to help you over the water,\" said the fish.    \"How can you, when I want a ship, and some one to show me the way?\"  answered Rosy.    \"I shall just call my friend the whale, and he will take you over better  than a ship, because he won't get wrecked. Don't mind if he spouts  and flounces about a good deal, he is only playing; so you needn't be  frightened.\"    Down dived the little fish, and Rosy waited to see what would happen;  for she didn't believe such a tiny thing could really bring a whale to  help her.    Presently what looked like a small island came floating through the sea;  and turning round, so that its tail touched the shore, the whale said,  in a roaring voice that made her jump,--    \"Come aboard, little girl, and hold on tight. I'll carry you wherever  you like.\"    It was rather a slippery bridge, and Rosy was rather scared at this big,  strange boat; but she got safely over, and held on fast; then, with a  roll and a plunge, off went the whale, spouting two fountains, while his  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7439"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#11)"],[1,"to it, and found the back door and knocked at it,  till one of the maid-servants came and asked him what he wanted. He said  that night was on him, and he wanted to get some place to sleep. The  maid-servant called him in to the fire, and gave him plenty to eat,  good meat and bread and beer; and as he was eating his food by the fire,  there came the young lady to look at him, and she loved him well and he  loved her. And the young lady ran to tell her father, and said there was  a pretty young man in the back kitchen; and immediately the gentleman  came to him, and questioned him, and asked what work he could do. Jack  said, the silly fellow, that he could do anything. (He meant that he  could do any foolish bit of work, that would be wanted about the house.)    \"Well,\" says the gentleman to him, \"if you can do anything, at eight  o'clock in the morning I must have a great lake and some of-the largest  man-of-war vessels sailing before my mansion, and one of the largest  vessels must fire a royal salute, and the last round must break the  leg of the bed where my young daughter is sleeping. And if you don't do  that, you will have to forfeit your life.\"    \"All right,\" said Jack; and away he went to his bed, and said his  prayers quietly, and slept till it was near eight o'clock, and he had  hardly any time to think what he was to do, till all of a sudden he  remembered about the little golden box that his father gave him. And he  said to himself: \"Well, well, I never was so near my death as I am now;\"  and then he felt in his pocket, and drew the little box out. And when he  opened it, out there hopped three little red men, and asked Jack: \"What  is your will with us?\" \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I want a great lake and some  of the largest man-of-war vessels in the world before this mansion, and  one of the largest vessels to fire a royal salute, and the last round  to break one of the legs of the bed where this young lady is sleeping.\"  \"All right,\" said the little men; \"go to sleep.\"    Jack had hardly time to bring the words out of his mouth, to tell the  little men what to do, but what it struck eight o'clock, when Bang, bang  went one of the largest man-of-war vessels; and it made Jack jump out of  bed to look through the window; and I can assure you it was a wonderful  sight for him to see, after being so long with his father and mother  living in a wood.    By this time Jack dressed himself, and said his prayers, and came down  laughing; for he was proud, he was, because the thing was done so well.  The gentleman comes to him, and says to him: \"Well, my young man, I must  say that you are very clever indeed. Come and have some breakfast.\" And  the gentleman tells him, \"Now there are two more things you have to  do, and then you shall have my daughter in marriage.\" Jack gets his  breakfast, and has a good squint at the young lady, and also she at him.    The other thing that the gentleman told him to do was to fell all the  great trees for miles around by eight o'clock in the morning; and, to  make my long story short, it was done, and it pleased the gentleman well  The gentleman said to him: \"The other thing you have to do\"--(and it  was the last thing)--\"you must get me a great castle standing on twelve  golden pillars; and there must come regiments of soldiers and go through  their drill. At eight o'clock the commanding officer must say, 'Shoulder  up.'\" \"All right,\" said Jack; when the third and last morning came  the third great feat was finished, and he had the young daughter in  marriage. But, oh dear! there is worse to come yet.    The gentleman now makes a large hunting party, and invites all the  gentlemen around the country to it, and to see the castle as well. And  by this time Jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with  them. On that morning his valet, when putting Jack's clothes by,  after changing them to go a hunting, put his hand in one of Jack's  waistcoat-pockets, and pulled out the little golden snuffbox, as poor  Jack left behind in a mistake. And that man opened the little box, and  there hopped the three little red men out, and asked him what he wanted  with them. \"Well,\" said the valet to them, \"I want this castle to be  moved from this place far and far across the sea.\" \"All right,\" said  the little red men to him; \"do you wish to go with it?\" \"Yes,\" said he.  \"Well, get up,\" said they to him; and away they went far and far over  the great sea.    Now the grand hunting party comes back, and the castle upon the twelve  golden pillars had disappeared, to the great disappointment of those  gentlemen as did not see it before. That poor silly Jack is threatened  by taking his beautiful young wife from him, for taking them in in the  way he did. But the gentleman at last made an agreement with him, and he  is to have a twelvemonths and a day to look for it; and off he goes with  a good horse and money in his pocket.    Now poor Jack goes in search of his missing castle, over hills, dales,  valleys, and mountains, through woolly woods and sheepwalks, further  than I can tell you or ever intend to tell you. Until at last he comes  up to the place where lives the King of all the little mice in the  world. There was one of the little mice on sentry at the front gate  going up to the palace, and did try to stop Jack from going in. He asked  the little mouse: \"Where does the King live? I should like to see him.\"  This one sent another with him to show him the place; and when the King  saw him, he called him in. And the King questioned him, and asked him  where he was going that way. Well, Jack told him all the truth, that he  had lost the great castle, and was going to look for it, and he had a  whole twelvemonths and a day to find it out. And Jack asked him whether  he knew anything about it; and the King said: \"No, but I am the King  of all the little mice in the world, and I will call them all up in the  morning, and maybe they have seen something of it.\"    Then Jack got a good meal and bed, and in the morning he and the King  went on to the fields; and the King called all the mice together, and  asked them whether they had seen the great beautiful castle standing on  golden pillars. And all the little mice said, No, there was none of them  had seen it. The old King said to him that he had two other brothers:  \"One is the King of all the frogs; and my other brother, who is the  oldest, he is the King of all the birds in the world. And if you go  there, may be they know something about the missing castle.\" The King  said to him: \"Leave your horse here with me till you come back, and take  one of my best horses under you, and give this cake to my brother; he  will know then who you got it from. Mind and tell him I am well, and  should like dearly to see him.\" And then the King and Jack shook hands  together.    And when Jack was going through the gates, the little mouse asked him,  should he go with him; and Jack said to him: \"No, I shall get myself  into trouble with the King.\" And the little thing told him: \"It will be  better for you to let me go with you; maybe I shall do some good to you  some time without you knowing it.\" \"Jump up, then.\" And the little mouse  ran up the horse's leg, and made it dance; and Jack put the mouse in his  pocket.    Now Jack, after wishing good morning to the King and pocketing the  little mouse which was on sentry, trudged on his way; and such a long  way he had to go and this was his first day. At last he found the place;  and there was one of the frogs on sentry, and gun upon his shoulder, and  did try to hinder Jack from going in; but when Jack said to him that he  wanted to see the King, he allowed him to pass; and Jack made up to the  door. The King came out, and asked him his business; and Jack told  him all from beginning to end. \"Well, well, come in.\" He gets good  entertainment that night; and in the morning the King made such a funny  sound, and collected all the frogs in the world. And he asked them,  did they know or see anything of a castle that stood upon twelve golden  pillars; and they all made a curious sound, _Kro-kro, kro-kro_, and  said, No.    Jack had to take another horse, and a cake to this King's brother, who  is the King of all the fowls of the air; and as Jack was going through  the gates, the little frog that was on sentry asked John should he go  with him. Jack refused him for a bit; but at last he told him to jump  up, and Jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket. And away he went  again on his great long journey; it was three times as long this time as  it was the first day; however, he found the place, and there was a fine  bird on sentry. And Jack passed him, and he never said a word to him;  and he talked with the King, and told him everything, all about the  castle. \"Well,\" said the King to him, \"you shall know in the morning  from my birds, whether they know anything or not.\" Jack put up his horse  in the stable, and then went to bed, after having something to eat. And  when he got up in the morning the King and he went on to some field, and  there the King made some funny noise, and there came all the fowls that  were in all the world. And the King asked them; \"Did they see the fine  castle?\" and all the birds answered, No. \"Well,\" said the King, \"where  is the great bird?\" They had to wait then for a long time for the eagle  to make his appearance, when at last he came all in a perspiration,  after sending two little birds high up in the sky to whistle on him to  make all the haste he possibly could. The King asked the great bird,  Did he see the great castle? and the bird said: \"Yes, I came from there  where it now is.\" \"Well,\" says the King to him; \"this young gentleman  has lost it, and you must go with him back to it; but stop till you get  a bit of something to eat first.\"    They killed a thief, and sent the best part of it to feed the eagle on  his journey over the seas, and had to carry Jack on "]]]
