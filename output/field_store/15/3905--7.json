It would not be  impossible for me to contrive to live, were I alone here, for I should  get at least 300 florins from Count Seeau. My board would cost little,  for I should be often invited out; and even were it not so, Albert would  always be charmed to see me at dinner in his house. I eat little, drink  water, and for dessert take only a little fruit and a small glass  of wine. Subject to the advice of my kind friends, I would make the  following contract with Count Seeau:--I would engage to produce every  year four German operas, partly buffe and partly serie; from each of  these I should claim the profits of one performance, for such is the  custom here. This alone would bring me in 500 florins, which along with  my salary would make up 800 florins, but in all probability more; for  Reiner, an actor and singer, cleared 200 florins by his benefit, and  I am VERY MUCH BELOVED HERE, and how much more so should I be if I  contributed to the elevation of the national theatre of Germany in  music! And this would certainly be the case with me, for I was inspired  with the most eager desire to write when I heard the German operettas.  The name of the first singer here is Keiserin; her father is cook to a  count here; she is a very pleasing girl, and pretty on the stage; I have  not yet seen her near. She is a native of this place. When I heard her  it was only her third appearance on the stage. She has a fine voice, not  powerful, though by no means weak, very pure, and a good intonation.  Her instructor is Valesi; and her style of singing shows that her master  knows how to sing as well as how to teach. When she sustains her  voice for a couple of bars, I am quite surprised at the beauty of her  crescendo and decrescendo. She as yet takes her shakes slowly, and this  I highly approve of, for it will be all the more pure and clear if she  ever wishes to take it quicker; besides, it is easier when quick. She is  a great favorite with the people here, and with me.    Mamma was in the pit; she went as early as half-past four o'clock to get  a place. I, however, did not go till half-past six o'clock, for I can go  to any box I please, being pretty well known. I was in the Brancas' box;  I looked at Keiserin with my opera-glass, and at times she drew tears  from my eyes. I often called out bravo, bravissimo, for I always  remembered that it was only her third appearance. The piece was Das  Fischermadchen, a very good translation of Piccini's opera, with his  music. As yet they have no original pieces, but are now anxious soon  to give a German opera seria, and a strong wish prevails that I should  compose it. The aforesaid Professor Huber is one of those who wish  this. I shall now go to bed, for I can sit up no longer. It is just ten  o'clock. Baron Rumling lately paid me the following compliment: \"The  theatre is my delight--good actors and actresses, good singers, and a  clever composer, such as yourself.\" This is indeed only talk, and words  are not of much value, but he never before spoke to me in this way.    I write this on the 3d of October. To-morrow the court departs, and does  not return till the 20th. If it had remained here, I would have taken  the step I intended, and stayed on here for a time; but as it is, I hope  to resume my journey with mamma next Tuesday. But meanwhile the project  of the associated friends, which I lately wrote to you about, may be  realized, so that when we no longer care to travel we shall have a  resource to fall back upon. Herr von Krimmel was to-day with the Bishop  of Chiemsee, with whom he has a good deal to do on the subject of salt.  He is a strange man; here he is called \"your Grace,\"--that is, THE  LACKEYS do so. Having a great desire that I should remain here, he spoke  very zealously to the Prince in my favor. He said to me, \"Only let me  alone; I will speak to the Prince, and I have a right to do so, for I  have done many things to oblige him.\" The Prince promised him that I  should POSITIVELY be appointed, but the affair cannot be so quickly  settled. On the return of the court he is to speak to the Elector with  all possible earnestness and zeal. At eight o'clock this morning I  called on Count Seeau. I was very brief, and merely said, \"I have only  come, your Excellency, to explain my case clearly. I have been told that  I ought to go to Italy, which is casting a reproach on me. I was sixteen  months in Italy, I have written three operas, and all this is notorious  enough. What further occurred, your Excellency will see from these  papers.\" And after showing him the diplomata, I added, \"I only show  these and say this to your Excellency that, in the event of my being  spoken of, and any injustice done me, your Excellency may with good  grounds take my part.\" He asked me if I was now going to France. I said  I intended to remain in Germany; by this, however, he supposed I meant  Munich, and said, with a merry laugh, \"So you are to stay here after  all?\" I replied, \"No! to tell you the truth, I should like to have  stayed, if the Elector had favored me with a small sum, so that I might  then have offered my compositions to your Excellency devoid of all  interested motives. It would have been a pleasure to me to do this.\" At  these words he half lifted his skull-cap.    At ten o'clock I went to court to call on Countess Salern. I dined  afterwards with the Brancas. Herr Geheimrath von Branca, having been  invited by the French Ambassador, was not at home. He is called \"your  Excellency.\" Countess Salern is a Frenchwoman, and scarcely knows a word  of German; so I have always been in the habit of talking French to her.  I do so quite boldly, and she says that I don't speak at all badly,  and that I have the good habit of speaking slowly, which makes me more  easily understood. She is a most excellent person, and very well-bred.  The daughter plays nicely, but fails in time. I thought this arose from  want of ear on her part, but I find I can blame no one but her teacher,  who is too indulgent and too easily satisfied. I practised with her  to-day, and I could pledge myself that if she were to learn from me for  a couple of months, she would play both well and accurately.    At four o'clock I went to Frau von Tosson's, where I found mamma and  also Frau von Hepp. I played there till eight o'clock, and after that  we went home; and at half-past nine a small band of music arrived,  consisting of five persons--two clarionet-players, two horns, and one  bassoon. Herr Albert (whose name-day is to-morrow) arranged this music  in honor of me and himself. They played rather well together, and were  the same people whom we hear during dinner at Albert's, but it is well  known that they are trained by Fiala. They played some of his pieces,  and I must say they are very pretty: he has some excellent ideas.  To-morrow we are to have a small musical party together, where I am  to play. (Nota bene, on that miserable piano! oh, dear! oh, dear! oh,  dear!) I beg you will excuse my horrid writing, but ink, haste, sleep,  and dreams are all against me. I am now and forever amen, your dutiful  son,    A. W. MOZART.        63.    Munich, Oct. 6, 1777.    Mamma cannot write; in the first place, she is not inclined, and,  secondly, she has a headache. So I must hold the pen for her and keep  faith with her. I am just going with the Professor to call on Madlle.  Keiserin. Yesterday we had in our house a clerical wedding, or altum  tempus ecclesiasticum. There was dancing, but I only danced four  minuets, and was in my own room again by eleven o'clock, for, out of  fifty young ladies, there was only one who danced in time--Madlle.  Kaser, a sister of Count Perusa's secretary. The Professor thought fit  to leave me in the lurch, so I did not go to Madlle. Keiserin, because  I don't know where she lives. Last Saturday, the 4th, on the stately  and solemn occasion of the name-day of his Royal Highness the Archduke  Albert, we had a select music-party at home, which commenced at  half-past three o'clock and finished at eight. M. Dubreil, whom papa no  doubt remembers, was also present; he is a pupil of Tartini's. In the  forenoon he gave a lesson on the violin to the youngest son, Carl, and I  chanced to come in at the time, I never gave him credit for much talent,  but I saw that he took great pains in giving his lesson; and when we  entered into conversation about violin, concert, and orchestral playing,  he reasoned very well, and was always of my opinion, so I retracted my  former sentiments with regard to him, and was persuaded that I should  find him play well in time, and a correct violinist in the orchestra.  I, therefore, invited him to be so kind as to attend our little music  rehearsal that afternoon. We played, first of all, the two quintets of  Haydn, but to my dismay I could scarcely hear Dubreil, who could not  play four continuous bars without a mistake. He could never find the  positions, and he was no good friend to the sospirs [short pauses]. The  only good thing was that he spoke politely and praised the quintets;  otherwise--As it was, I said nothing to him, but he kept constantly  saying himself, \"I beg your pardon, but really I am out again! the thing  is puzzling, but fine!\" I invariably replied, \"It does not in the least  signify; we are only among ourselves.\" I then played the concertos in  C, in B, and in E flat, and after that a trio of mine. This was finely  accompanied, truly! In the adagio I was obliged to play six bars of his  part. As a finale, I played my last divertimento in B; they all pricked  up their ears. I played as if I had been the greatest violin-player in  all Europe.    The Sunday after, at three o'clock, we were at a certain Herr von  Hamm's. The Bishop of Chiemsee set off to-day for Salzburg.

And now Archdale himself, as representing the  architects who held a retaining fee in connection with the Cathedral,  was called to give his opinion--and he gave it in almost the same words  which Bryce had heard him use twenty-four hours previously. After him  came the master-mason, expressing the same decided conviction--that the  real truth was that the pavement of the gallery had at that particular  place become so smooth, and was inclined towards the open doorway at  such a sharp angle, that the unfortunate man had lost his footing on it,  and before he could recover it had been shot out of the arch and over  the broken head of St. Wrytha's Stair. And though, at a juryman's wish,  Varner was recalled, and stuck stoutly to his original story of having  seen a hand which, he protested, was certainly not that of the dead  man, it soon became plain that the jury shared the Coroner's belief that  Varner in his fright and excitement had been mistaken, and no one was  surprised when the foreman, after a very brief consultation with his  fellows, announced a verdict of death by misadventure.    \"So the city's cleared of the stain of murder!\" said a man who sat next  to Bryce. \"That's a good job, anyway! Nasty thing, doctor, to think of  a murder being committed in a cathedral. There'd be a question of  sacrilege, of course--and all sorts of complications.\"    Bryce made no answer. He was watching Ransford, who was talking to the  Coroner. And he was not mistaken now--Ransford's face bore all the  signs of infinite relief. From--what? Bryce turned, to leave the stuffy,  rapidly-emptying court. And as he passed the centre table he saw old  Simpson Harker, who, after sitting in attentive silence for three hours  had come up to it, picked up the \"History of Barthorpe\" which had  been found in Braden's suit-case and was inquisitively peering at its  title-page.          CHAPTER VII. THE DOUBLE TRAIL      Pemberton Bryce was not the only person in Wrychester who was watching  Ransford with keen attention during these events. Mary Bewery, a young  woman of more than usual powers of observation and penetration, had been  quick to see that her guardian's distress over the affair in Paradise  was something out of the common. She knew Ransford for an exceedingly  tender-hearted man, with a considerable spice of sentiment in his  composition: he was noted for his more than professional interest in the  poorer sort of his patients and had gained a deserved reputation in the  town for his care of them. But it was somewhat surprising, even to Mary,  that he should be so much upset by the death of a total stranger as to  lose his appetite, and, for at any rate a couple of days, be so restless  that his conduct could not fail to be noticed by herself and her  brother. His remarks on the tragedy were conventional enough--a most  distressing affair--a sad fate for the poor fellow--most unexplainable  and mysterious, and so on--but his concern obviously went beyond that.  He was ill at ease when she questioned him about the facts; almost  irritable when Dick Bewery, schoolboy-like, asked him concerning  professional details; she was sure, from the lines about his eyes and a  worn look on his face, that he had passed a restless night when he came  down to breakfast on the morning of the inquest. But when he returned  from the inquest she noticed a change--it was evident, to her ready  wits, that Ransford had experienced a great relief. He spoke of relief,  indeed, that night at dinner, observing that the verdict which the jury  had returned had cleared the air of a foul suspicion; it would have  been no pleasant matter, he said, if Wrychester Cathedral had gained an  unenviable notoriety as the scene of a murder.    \"All the same,\" remarked Dick, who knew all the talk of the town,  \"Varner persists in sticking to what he's said all along. Varner  says--said this afternoon, after the inquest was over--that he's  absolutely certain of what he saw, and that he not only saw a hand in  a white cuff and black coat sleeve, but that he saw the sun gleam for  a second on the links in the cuff, as if they were gold or diamonds.  Pretty stiff evidence that, sir, isn't it?\"    \"In the state of mind in which Varner was at that moment,\" replied  Ransford, \"he wouldn't be very well able to decide definitely on what he  really did see. His vision would retain confused images. Probably he saw  the dead man's hand--he was wearing a black coat and white linen. The  verdict was a most sensible one.\"    No more was said after that, and that evening Ransford was almost  himself again. But not quite himself. Mary caught him looking very  grave, in evident abstraction, more than once; more than once she heard  him sigh heavily. But he said no more of the matter until two days  later, when, at breakfast, he announced his intention of attending John  Braden's funeral, which was to take place that morning.    \"I've ordered the brougham for eleven,\" he said, \"and I've arranged with  Dr. Nicholson to attend to any urgent call that comes in between that  and noon--so, if there is any such call, you can telephone to him. A few  of us are going to attend this poor man's funeral--it would be too bad  to allow a stranger to go to his grave unattended, especially after  such a fate. There'll be somebody representing the Dean and Chapter,  and three or four principal townsmen, so he'll not be quite neglected.  And\"--here he hesitated and looked a little nervously at Mary, to whom  he was telling all this, Dick having departed for school--\"there's a  little matter I wish you'd attend to--you'll do it better than I should.  The man seems to have been friendless; here, at any rate--no relations  have come forward, in spite of the publicity--so--don't you think it  would be rather--considerate, eh?--to put a wreath, or a cross, or  something of that sort on his grave--just to show--you know?\"    \"Very kind of you to think of it,\" said Mary. \"What do you wish me to  do?\"    \"If you'd go to Gardales', the florists, and order--something fitting,  you know,\" replied Ransford, \"and afterwards--later in the day--take it  to St. Wigbert's Churchyard--he's to be buried there--take it--if you  don't mind--yourself, you know.\"    \"Certainly,\" answered Mary. \"I'll see that it's done.\"    She would do anything that seemed good to Ransford--but all the same she  wondered at this somewhat unusual show of interest in a total stranger.  She put it down at last to Ransford's undoubted sentimentality--the  man's sad fate had impressed him. And that afternoon the sexton at St.  Wigbert's pointed out the new grave to Miss Bewery and Mr. Sackville  Bonham, one carrying a wreath and the other a large bunch of lilies.  Sackville, chancing to encounter Mary at the florist's, whither he had  repaired to execute a commission for his mother, had heard her business,  and had been so struck by the notion--or by a desire to ingratiate  himself with Miss Bewery--that he had immediately bought flowers  himself--to be put down to her account--and insisted on accompanying  Mary to the churchyard.    Bryce heard of this tribute to John Braden next day--from Mrs. Folliot,  Sackville Bonham's mother, a large lady who dominated certain circles  of Wrychester society in several senses. Mrs. Folliot was one of those  women who have been gifted by nature with capacity--she was conspicuous  in many ways. Her voice was masculine; she stood nearly six feet in her  stoutly-soled shoes; her breadth corresponded to her height; her eyes  were piercing, her nose Roman; there was not a curate in Wrychester  who was not under her thumb, and if the Dean himself saw her coming, he  turned hastily into the nearest shop, sweating with fear lest she should  follow him. Endued with riches and fortified by assurance, Mrs. Folliot  was the presiding spirit in many movements of charity and benevolence;  there were people in Wrychester who were unkind enough to say--behind  her back--that she was as meddlesome as she was most undoubtedly  autocratic, but, as one of her staunchest clerical defenders once  pointed out, these grumblers were what might be contemptuously dismissed  as five-shilling subscribers. Mrs. Folliot, in her way, was undoubtedly  a power--and for reasons of his own Pemberton Bryce, whenever he met  her--which was fairly often--was invariably suave and polite.    \"Most mysterious thing, this, Dr. Bryce,\" remarked Mrs. Folliot in her  deepest tones, encountering Bryce, the day after the funeral, at the  corner of a back street down which she was about to sail on one of her  charitable missions, to the terror of any of the women who happened to  be caught gossiping. \"What, now, should make Dr. Ransford cause flowers  to be laid on the grave of a total stranger? A sentimental feeling?  Fiddle-de-dee! There must be some reason.\"    \"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs. Folliot,\"  answered Bryce, whose ears had already lengthened. \"Has Dr. Ransford  been laying flowers on a grave?--I didn't know of it. My engagement with  Dr. Ransford terminated two days ago--so I've seen nothing of him.\"    \"My son, Mr. Sackville Bonham,\" said Mrs. Folliot, \"tells me  that yesterday Miss Bewery came into Gardales' and spent a  sovereign--actually a sovereign!--on a wreath, which, she told  Sackville, she was about to carry, at her guardian's desire, to  this strange man's grave. Sackville, who is a warm-hearted boy, was  touched--he, too, bought flowers and accompanied Miss Bewery. Most  extraordinary! A perfect stranger! Dear me--why, nobody knows who the  man was!\"    \"Except his bank-manager,\" remarked Bryce, \"who says he's holding ten  thousand pounds of his.\"    \"That,\" admitted Mrs. Folliot gravely, \"is certainly a consideration.  But then, who knows?--the money may have been stolen. Now, really, did  you ever hear of a quite"]]]
