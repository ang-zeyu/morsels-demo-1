The  other branch comes in on the right, so we will keep on the left bank.  I don't think there is much fear of our missing the junction of the  stream, but if we do, we will row on to a mile below the point where we  think it is, then cross and keep up on the other side. In that way we  cannot miss it.\"    For the next half hour no word was spoken in the boat. Dick kept his  eyes fixed on the opposite bank. Suddenly he touched the lieutenant.    \"There, sir, that must be it. The line of the trees has suddenly  stopped, and I think I can make out a lower line behind it.\"    \"Yes, no doubt that is the junction. We will go two hundred yards  farther down before we cross; it is unlikely in the extreme that anyone  is watching us, still I don't want to run the slightest risk.\"    In another five minutes they crossed the river, whose increased width  showed them that they had assuredly passed the junction of the stream.  Then they turned and followed the right hand bank.    \"Stretch out a bit now, lads; you have fifteen miles' straight rowing  before you, and the sooner you get to the other end, the better. We may  have a long night's work before us, and I want to be able to get to the  place where we fished before morning.\"    The men bent to their oars, and the boat sped swiftly along. The current  was very slight, and after two hours' rowing, the lieutenant judged that  they must be but a short distance from the village Hassan's messenger  spoke of. Accordingly, he told the coxswain to steer across to the other  bank, and warned the men that the slightest splash of their oars might  attract attention, and that they were to row easier for the present.  In a quarter of an hour the wall of forest ceased, and a hundred yards  farther they saw houses. Two or three dim lights were visible, and  the sound of voices could be heard. The boat's head was now turned out  somewhat farther into the stream, so as to be out of sight of anyone  who might by chance come down late to draw water. After rowing a hundred  yards they could dimly make out the outline of a white house. There  was a break just in the center, and the outline of a tree could be seen  above the roof. Dick leant forward and again touched the lieutenant.    \"That must be the house, sir,\" he whispered.    Mr. Ferguson nodded without speaking; and after the boat had gone  another hundred yards, the line of forest could again be seen, and  the boat was rowed into the bank, and two minutes later shot through a  narrow channel and entered a creek some forty yards wide.    \"Now you can give way again, lads.\"    An hour's paddling in a sampan would mean about three miles, and after  twenty minutes' sharp rowing, the men were ordered to row easy again,  and the lieutenant and Dick kept an anxious lookout ahead. The creek was  here little more than fifty yards across, and, accustomed as their eyes  were to darkness, they presently saw that it widened out suddenly. The  word was passed down for the men to paddle easily, and in two minutes  the pool opened before them. They could not make out the prahus, lying  as they did against the shadow of the trees on the farther side, but  they could see a number of lights, apparently from swinging lanterns,  and hear a loud murmur of voices.    \"Easy all,\" the lieutenant ordered now; \"back her very quietly; now pull  bow.\"    Noiselessly the boat was brought round, and its head directed to the  right hand bank. They had passed a sharp bend nearly half a mile back,  and the lieutenant said, \"Look out for a landing place at the deepest  point of the curve, Harris.\"    \"Aye, aye, sir!\" the coxswain said, standing up. A minute later he  brought the boat alongside, at a point which was free from bushes, and  where the bank was but two feet above the water's edge.        CHAPTER VII.      \"Now, Mr. Balderson, take Harper and Winthorpe, and make your way  through the jungle as noiselessly as possible. It is probable that the  path runs within fifty yards of this point, possibly it is only half a  dozen. When you have found it, send Winthorpe back to me with the news.  Take that long coil of thin rope that is in the bow, and pay it out as  you go along. You might get lost even within two yards of the stream,  and it would be dangerous to call or whistle. It will enable me to join  you. Leave your muskets behind, lads; they would only be in the way  in the jungle, and you have your pistols and cutlasses. You take the  lantern, Winthorpe, and Harper, do you take the rope. Fasten one end to  the thwart before you start, or, without knowing it, you might drag it  after you.\"    Dick led the way, the others following close behind, but as soon as  they were among the trees, he was obliged to take the lantern, for the  darkness was so intense that he could not see an inch before him and  would have been torn to pieces by the thorny creepers had he tried to  penetrate without a light.    As it was, he received several nasty scratches, and could hear muttered  exclamations from the men behind him. Creeping under some of the  rattans, making detours to avoid others, and cutting some of the smaller  ones in two with his cutlass, he made his way forward, and was delighted  indeed when, after proceeding some twenty yards, he came upon the edge  of what looked like a ditch, but which was, he knew, the native path.    \"Here we are, lads,\" he exclaimed in a low tone; \"thank goodness we have  not had to go farther.\"    \"So say I, sir,\" one of the men grumbled; \"if it had not been for your  lantern I should have been torn to pieces. As it is, I aint sure whether  my eyes aint gone, and my nose and cheeks are scratched as if I had been  fighting with a mad cat.\"    \"Here, Winthorpe, take the lantern and make your way back; darken it as  soon as you get through to the edge of the creek. You cannot go wrong  with the cord to guide you.\"    Two or three minutes later Dick saw the light approaching again, and the  lieutenant, the coxswain, and two bluejackets joined him, Winthorpe and  another having been left as boat keepers.    \"Now, Harris, do you and one of the others go on ahead; we will follow  fifty yards behind you. If you hear anyone coming, give a low whistle;  we will then turn off the light. You can walk on confidently, for there  is no chance of any of these prickly creepers running across the path.  When you see the trees are getting thinner, or that there is an opening  before you, stop and send back word to us, so that we can shut up the  lantern before joining you.\"    The lieutenant headed the party now, followed by Dick. He held the  lantern close to the ground; the bottom was, like all jungle paths, worn  perfectly smooth by the passage of the barefooted natives.    \"Nothing could be better,\" he said in a low voice to Dick. \"We ought to  be able to haul the guns along here at a trot; and the opening is wide  enough on each side for a gun carriage to be carried along without any  difficulty.\"    In ten minutes one of the men ahead came back.    \"We have got to the end of the path, sir; it ends on the bank of that  pool we saw ahead.\"    The lantern was now extinguished, and the party hurried forward. On  reaching the bank they found that the path ended, as they had expected,  just opposite the village. The prahus lay somewhat to the right.    \"It could not be better,\" the lieutenant whispered. \"Now let us see  whether we can find a suitable place for the guns.\"    This was much easier than they had expected, for the trees were cleared,  probably to furnish firewood, for a distance of some fifteen yards from  the bank; between this cleared place and the water was a fringe of thick  bushes.    \"This will do capitally, lads. Now we will be off at once; we have found  out all that we wanted, and nothing could be more satisfactory.\"    They retraced their steps rapidly till they came to the coil of cord  looped on a low bough. The coxswain took it down, and they were soon all  on board the boat again. \"Now, lads, row as noiselessly as you can to  the mouth of the pool again, then turn, and lay on your oars, except bow  and two, who are to paddle very slowly. Hand Mr. Balderson that twenty  foot bamboo; I want to sound the river as we come back.\"    As soon as the boat was again turned, Dick took the pole, and,  standing up, thrust it down into the water.    \"Only about seven feet, sir,\" he whispered.    \"That is bad. It is evident that the ship cannot get up here; still we  may as well go on sounding.\"    \"The water is gradually deepening,\" Dick said, thrusting the pole down  again; \"there are nearly ten feet.\"    It was not long before he announced fifteen, and at that continued until  they reached the entrance to the creek, where it was only fourteen feet.    \"It would be a touch and go there,\" the lieutenant said, \"but I dare say  she could be pushed through. It is very unfortunate that there is that  shallow bar this side of the pool. And now, lads, you can lay out for  ten minutes, and then we can fasten up to a bough and see what is in the  hamper. We have done our work earlier than I had expected, and can take  it easy.\"    The steward had provided them with an ample store of food, and the men  ate their hunks of cold meat and bread, and passed round the pannikins  of grog, with great contentment, while the officers divided a cold  chicken and a bottle of claret.    \"Now, men,\" the lieutenant said, when they had finished, \"you can have  a quarter of an hour's smoke. You must open the lantern in the bottom of  the boat, and hold a jacket over it to prevent the light falling on any  of you.\"    When the men had lit their pipes the lantern was passed aft, and while  the coxswain put his jacket over it, the lieutenant lit a cigar.    \"You smoke, don't you, Balderson?\"    \"Yes, sir, I began when we came up the river; the doctor said it is a  good thing to keep off miasma.\"    \"Very well, then light up; I think that it is a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],[0,"Birds in Town & Village (#11)"],[1," is our perfect  mocking-bird, our one professional mimic; while the starling in  comparison is but an amateur. We all know the starling's ever varying  performance in which he attempts a hundred things and occasionally  succeeds; but even the starling sometimes affects us with a mild  astonishment, and I will here give one instance.    I was staying at a village in the Wiltshire downs, and at intervals,  while sitting at work in my room on the ground floor, I heard the  cackling of a fowl at the cottage opposite. I heard, but paid no  attention to that familiar sound; but after three days it all at once  struck me that no fowl could lay an egg about every ten or twelve  minutes, and go on at this rate day after day, and, getting up, I went  out to look for the cackler. A few hens were moving quietly about the  open ground surrounding the cottage where the sound came from, but I  heard nothing. By and by, when I was back in my room, the cackling  sounded again, but when I got out the sound had ceased and the fowls, as  before, appeared quite unexcited. The only way to solve the mystery was  to stand there, out of doors, for ten minutes, and before that time was  over a starling with a white grub in his beak, flew down and perched on  the low garden wall of the cottage, then, with some difficulty, squeezed  himself through a small opening into a cavity under a strip of zinc  which covered the bricks of the wall. It was a queer place for a  starling's nest, on a wall three feet high and within two yards of the  cottage door which stood open all day. Having delivered the grub, the  starling came out again and, hopping on to the zinc, opened his beak and  cackled like a hen, then flew away for more grubs.    I observed the starling a good deal after this, and found that  invariably on leaving the nest, he uttered his imitation of a fowl  cackling, and no other note or sound of any kind. It was as if he was  not merely imitating a sound, but had seen a fowl leaving the nest and  then cackling, and mimicked the whole proceeding, and had kept up the  habit after the young were hatched.    To return to my experience on the common. About fifty yards from the  spot where I was there was a dense thicket of furze and thorn, with a  huge mound in the middle composed of a tangle of whitethorn and bramble  bushes mixed with ivy and clematis. From this spot, at intervals of half  a minute or so, there issued the call of a duck--the prolonged, hoarse  call of a drake, two or three times repeated, evidently emitted in  distress. I conjectured that it came from one of a small flock of ducks  belonging to a cottage near the edge of the common on that side. The  flock, as I had seen, was accustomed to go some distance from home, and  I supposed that one of them, a drake, had got into that brambly thicket  and could not make his way out. For half an hour I heard the calls  without paying much attention, absorbed in watching the quaint little  songster close to me and his curious gestures when emitting his  sustained reeling sounds. In the end the persistent distressed calling  of the drake lost in a brambly labyrinth got a little on my nerves, and  I felt it as a relief when it finally ceased. Then, after a short  silence, another sound came from the same spot--a blackbird sound, known  to everyone, but curiously interesting when uttered in the way I now  heard it. It was the familiar loud chuckle, not emitted in alarm and  soon ended, but the chuckle uttered occasionally by the bird when he is  not disturbed, or when, after uttering it once for some real cause, he  continues repeating it for no reason at all, producing the idea that he  has just made the discovery that it is quite a musical sound and that he  is repeating it, as if singing, just for pleasure. At such times the  long series of notes do not come forth with a rush; he begins  deliberately with a series of musical chirps uttered in a measured  manner, like those of a wood wren, the prelude to its song, the notes  coming faster and faster and swelling and running into the loud  chuckling performance. This performance, like the lost drake's call, was  repeated in the same deliberate or leisurely manner at intervals again  and again, until my curiosity was aroused and I went to the spot to get  a look at the bird who had turned his alarm sound into a song and  appeared to be very much taken with it.  But there was no blackbird at  the spot, and no lost drake, and no bird, except a throstle sitting  motionless on the bush mound. This was the bird I had been listening to,  uttering not his own thrush melody, which he perhaps did not know at  all, but the sounds he had borrowed from two species so wide apart in  their character and language.    The astonishing thing in this case was that the bird never uttered a  note of his own original and exceedingly copious song; and I could only  suppose that he had never learned the thrush melody; that he had,  perhaps, been picked up as a fledgling and put in a cage, where he had  imitated the sounds he heard and liked best, and made them his song, and  that he had finally escaped or had been liberated.    The wild thrush, we know, does introduce certain imitations into his own  song, but the borrowed notes, or even phrases, are, as a rule, few, and  not always to be distinguished from his own.    Sometimes one can pick them out; thus, on the borders of a marsh where  redshanks bred, I have heard the call of that bird distinctly given by  the thrush. And again, where the ring-ouzel is common, the thrush will  get its brief song exactly. When thrushes taken from the nest are reared  in towns, where they never hear the thrush or any other bird sing, they  are often exceedingly vocal, and utter a medley of sounds which are  sometimes distressing to the ear. I have heard many caged thrushes of  this kind in London, but the most remarkable instance I have met with  was at the little seaside town of Seaford. Here, in the main shopping  street, a caged thrush lived for years in a butcher's shop, and poured  out its song continuously, the most distressing throstle performance I  ever heard, composed of a medley of loud, shrill and harsh  sounds--imitations of screams and shouts, boy whistlers, saw filing,  knives sharpened on steels, and numerous other unclassifiable noises;  but all, more or less, painful. The whole street was filled with the  noise, and the owner used to boast that his caged thrush was the most  persistent as well as the loudest singer that had ever been heard. He  had no nerves, and was proud of it! On a recent visit to Seaford I  failed to hear the bird when walking about the town, and after two or  three days went into the shop to enquire about it. They told me it was  dead--that it had been dead over a year; also that many visitors to  Seaford had missed its song and had called at the shop to ask about the  bird. The strangest thing about its end, they said, was its suddenness.  The bird was singing its loudest one morning, and had been at it for  some time, filling the whole place with its noise, when suddenly, in the  middle of its song, it dropped down dead from its perch.    To drop dead while singing is not an unheard of, nor a very rare  occurrence in caged birds, and it probably happens, too, in birds living  their natural life. Listening to a nightingale, pouring out its powerful  music continuously, as the lark sings, one sometimes wonders that  something does not give way to end the vocalist's performance and life  at the same instant. Some such incident was probably the origin of the  old legend of the minstrel and the nightingale on which Strada based his  famous poem, known in many languages. In England Crawshaw's version was  by far the best, and is perhaps the finest bird poem in our literature.    The blackbird, like the thrush, sometimes borrows a note or a phrase,  and, like the thrush again, if reared by hand he may become a nuisance  by mimicking some disagreeable sound, and using it by way of song. I  heard of such a case a short time ago at Sidmouth. The ground floor of  the house where I lodged was occupied by a gentleman who had a fondness  for bird music, and being an invalid confined to his rooms, he kept a  number of birds in cages. He had, besides canaries, the thrush,  chaffinch, linnet, goldfinch and cirl bunting. I remarked that he did  not have the best singer of all--the blackbird. He said that he had  procured one, or that some friend had sent him one, a very beautiful  ouel cock in the blackest plumage and with the orange-tawniest bill,  and he had anticipated great pleasure from hearing its fluting melody.  But alas! no blackbird song did this unnatural blackbird sing. He had  learnt to bark like a dog, and whenever the singing spirit took him he  would bark once or twice or three times, and then, after an interval of  silence of the proper length, about fifteen seconds, he would bark  again, and so on until he had had his fill of music for the time. The  barking got on the invalid's nerves, and he sent the bird away. \"It was  either that,\" he said, \"or losing my senses altogether.\"    * * *    As all or most singing birds learn their songs from the adults of the  same species, it is not strange that there should be a good deal of what  we call mimicry in their performances: we may say, in fact, that pretty  well all the true singers are mimics, but that some mimic more than  others. Thus, the starling is more ready to borrow other birds' notes  than the thrush, while the marsh-warbler borrows so much that his  singing is mainly composed of borrowings. The nightingale is, perhaps,  an exception. His voice excels in power and purity of sound, and what we  may call his artistry is exceptionally perfect; this may account for the  fact that he does not borrow from other birds' songs. I should say, from  my own observation, that all songsters are interested in the singing of  other"]]]
