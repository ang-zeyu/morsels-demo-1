The women archers were filled with pity to see the blind men gobbling  and sighing with joy at what was set before them. For in truth they  were half starved, and they swallowed down the puddings as though they  had been oysters. And the dobbel peterman flowed into their stomachs  as if it had been a cataract falling down from some lofty mountain.    When at length they had cleared their trenchers, they demanded yet  further supplies of koekebakken, ortolans, and fricassees. Mine host,  however, only provided a great platter of beef and veal and mutton  bones, all swimming in a most goodly sauce. But he did not divide it  properly. So that when they had well dipped their bread in the sauce,  and eke their hands right up to the elbows, yet drew not out anything  but bones of cutlet of veal or mutton, each man fell straightway  to imagining that his neighbour had got hold of all the meat, and  they began to fight among themselves, hitting out most furiously one  against another with the bones.    The Brethren of the Jolly Face laughed heartily at this, but being  charitably disposed, each put a portion of his own dinner into the  blind men's platter. So now if one of the blind went searching for a  new bone with which to carry on the fight, he would put his hand belike  upon a thrush or chicken or a lark or two; and all the time the women,  holding their heads well backwards, kept pouring into the mouths  of the blind long draughts of Brussels wine, and when they reached  out with their hands to feel, as blind men will, whence came these  rivulets of ambrosia, they would catch oftentimes at a woman's skirt,  and try to hold it fast. But quickly the skirt would make its escape.    Thus they laughed and drank, ate and sang, enjoying themselves  hugely. Some of them, when they found that women were present, ran  through the hall all maddened with amorous desire. But the malicious  girls kept out of their way, hiding behind the Brethren of the Jolly  Face. And one of them would say: \"Come, kiss me!\" And when the blind  victim tried to do so he would find himself kissing not a girl at  all but the bearded face of a man, who would reward him with a cuff  on the cheek as like as not.    And the Brethren of the Jolly Face began to sing, and the blind men  sang also, and the merry women smiled with fond delight to see their  pleasure. But when the juicy hours were past, it was the turn of the  innkeeper, who came forward, saying:    \"Now you have eaten your fill, my friends, and drunk your fill. You  owe me seven florins.\"    But each of the blind men swore that he had no purse, and asserted  that it was one of the others who carried it. Thereat arose a further  dispute, and they began to hit out at one another with feet and hands  and heads; but they mostly missed their mark, striking out at random,  while the Brethren of the Jolly Face, entering into the fun, took  care to keep them apart, so that their blows rained down upon the  empty air--all save one, which happened unfortunately to strike the  face of the innkeeper, who straightway fell into a rage and ransacked  all their pockets. But he found there nothing but an old scapular,  seven liards, three breeches-buttons, and a few rosaries.    At last he threatened to throw the whole lot of them into the  pig-trough, and leave them there with nothing but bread and water to  eat till they paid what they owed.    \"Let me go surety for them,\" said Ulenspiegel.    \"Certainly,\" answered the innkeeper, \"if some one will also go surety  for you.\"    This the Brethren of the Jolly Face at once offered to do, but  Ulenspiegel refused them.    \"No,\" he said, \"the Dean of Uccle shall be my surety. I will go and  find him.\"    To be sure it was those Masses for the dead that he was thinking  of. And when he had found the Dean he told him a story of how the  innkeeper of the Trumpet Inn was possessed by the Devil, and how he  could talk of nothing but \"pigs\" and \"blind men\"--something or other  about pigs eating the blind, and the blind eating the pigs under  various infamous forms of roast meats and fricassees. While these  attacks were on, the innkeeper, so Ulenspiegel affirmed, would break  up all the furniture in the inn; and he begged the Dean to come and  deliver the poor man from the wicked devil that possessed him.    The Dean promised to do so, but he said he could not come at the moment  (for he was busy with the accounts of the Chapter, trying to make  something out of them for himself). Seeing that the Dean was growing  impatient, Ulenspiegel said that he would return and bring with him  the innkeeper's wife in order that the Dean might speak to her himself.    \"Very well,\" said the Dean.    So Ulenspiegel came again to the innkeeper and said to him:    \"I have just seen the Dean, and he is willing to go surety for the  blind men. Do you keep watch over them, and let your wife come with  me, and the Dean will repeat to her what I have just told you.\"    \"Go, wife,\" said the innkeeper.    So the innkeeper's wife went with Ulenspiegel to the Dean, who was  still at his accounts and busy with the same problem. When, therefore,  he saw Ulenspiegel and the woman, he made an impatient gesture that  they should withdraw, saying at the same time:    \"It is all right. I will come to the help of your husband in a day  or two.\"    And Ulenspiegel went back to the inn and said to himself:    \"Seven florins shall he pay; seven florins. And that shall be the  first of my Masses for the dead!\"    And Ulenspiegel departed from that place, and the blind men likewise.              XXV      Now in those days Katheline had effected a cure, by means of herbs,  on three sheep, an ox, and a pig, all belonging to a certain man  named Speelman. She also attempted to cure a cow, the property of one  Jan Beloen, but in this she was not successful. Jan Beloen promptly  accused her of being a witch, asserting that she had laid a charm  on the animal, inasmuch as all the time she was giving the herbs  she had caressed it and talked to it, in the Devil's own language,  as was evident--for what business has an honest Christian woman to  go talking with an animal...?    Jan Beloen added that he was a neighbour of Speelman's, the man whose  ox had been cured, together with three sheep and a pig as aforesaid,  and if Katheline had now killed his cow, it was doubtless at the  instigation of Speelman, who was jealous at seeing his, Beloen's,  land better and more profitably cultivated than his own. Pieter  Meulmeester, a man of good life and reputation, and Jan Beloen himself  both testified that Katheline was commonly reputed to be a witch by  the people of Damme, and that she had certainly killed the cow; and  on this testimony Katheline was arrested and condemned to be tortured  until she had confessed her crimes and malpractices.    She was cross-examined by a certain alderman who was notorious for  his ill-temper, for he was accustomed to drink brandy all the day  long. And he ordered her to be placed on the seat of torture in the  presence of himself and the members of the Town Council.    The torturer put her on the seat stark naked, and then shaved off her  hair, looking carefully to see that no charm was concealed anywhere  about her person. Finding none, he bound her with cords to the seat  of torture. And she said:    \"It shames me to be naked before these men. O Mother Mary, let me die!\"    The torturer then wrapped some damp cloths round her breast and body  and legs, and raising the bench upright he proceeded to pour great  quantities of hot water down her throat so that her stomach became  all swollen. Then he let the bench down again.    The alderman asked Katheline if she would now acknowledge her  crime. She made a sign in the negative. And the torturer poured more  hot water into her; but this Katheline brought all up again.    Then by the advice of the doctor she was released. But she did not  speak a word, only beat her breast as much as to say that the hot  water had burned her. When the torturer saw that she was recovered  from this first ordeal, he said to her:    \"Confess that you are a witch, and that you laid a charm on the cow.\"    \"I will confess no such thing,\" replied Katheline. \"I am here in your  power. Nevertheless, I tell you that an animal can die of an illness,  just as a man can, and in spite of all the help of surgeons and of  doctors. And I swear by Our Lord Christ who was pleased to die upon  the Cross for our sins, that I wished to do no harm to this cow,  but simply to cure her by well-known remedies.\"    Thereat the alderman was angry and cried out:    \"This devil's drab, she cannot go on lying for ever! Put her to the  second torture.\"    Then he drank a large glass of brandy.    The torturer meanwhile sat Katheline down on the lid of an oak coffin  which was placed on trestles. Now the coffin-lid was pointed like a  roof, and the edge of it was as sharp as a sword. A great fire was  burning in the fireplace, for it was the month of November. Katheline,  seated on the edge of the coffin-lid, had her feet shod in shoes of  new leather several sizes too small for her, and then she was placed  in front of the fire. When she began to feel the sharp wood of the  coffin-lid cutting into her flesh, and when her shoes began to shrink  under the heat of the fire, Katheline cried aloud:    \"Oh, agony! Will no one give me a draught of black poison?\"    \"Put her nearer the fire,\" said the alderman.    Then he inquired of her:    \"How often, pray, have you ridden on a broom to the Witches'  Sabbath? And how many times have you caused the corn to wither in  the ear, and the fruit on the tree, and the babe in the womb of  its mother? And turned most loving brothers into sworn enemies,  and sisters into rivals full of hatred?\"    Katheline would have answered if she had been able. But she could  only move her arms, as if to say \"No.\" But the alderman said:    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#11)"],[1,"Lady Marney on the  importance of infant schools, but recalled his opinion when Lord Marney  expressed his imperious hope that no infant schools would ever be found  in his neighbourhood. Sir Vavasour was more than middle aged, comely,  very gentlemanlike, but with an air occasionally of absence which hardly  agreed with his frank and somewhat hearty idiosyncracy; his clear brow,  florid complexion, and blue eye. But Lord Marney talked a good deal,  though chiefly dogmatical or argumentative. It was rather difficult for  him to find a sufficient stock of opposition, but he laid in wait and  seized every opening with wonderful alacrity. Even Captain Grouse could  not escape him; if driven to extremity Lord Marney would even question  his principles on fly-making. Captain Grouse gave up, but not too soon;  he was well aware that his noble friend's passion for controversy was  equal to his love of conquest. As for Lady Marney, it was evident  that with no inconsiderable talents, and with an intelligence richly  cultivated, the controversial genius of her husband had completely cowed  her conversational charms. She never advanced a proposition that he did  not immediately bristle up, and she could only evade the encounter by a  graceful submission. As for the vicar, a frequent guest, he would fain  have taken refuge in silence, but the earl, especially when alone, would  what he called \"draw him out,\" and the game once unearthed, with so  skilled a pack there was but little fear of a bad run. When all were  reduced to silence, Lord Marney relinquishing controversy, assumed the  positive. He eulogized the new poor law, which he declared would be the  salvation of the country, provided it was \"carried out\" in the spirit in  which it was developed in the Marney Union; but then he would add  that there was no district except their union in which it was properly  observed. He was tremendously fierce against allotments and analysed  the system with merciless sarcasm, Indeed he had no inconsiderable  acquaintance with the doctrines of the economists, and was rather  inclined to carry them into practice in every instance, except that of  the landed proprietary, which he clearly proved \"stood upon different  grounds\" to that of any other \"interest.\" There was nothing he hated so  much as a poacher, except a lease; though perhaps in the catalogue  of his aversions, we ought to give the preference to his  anti-ecclesiastical prejudice: this amounted even to acrimony. Though  there was no man breathing who was possessed with such a strong  repugnance to subscriptions of any kind, it delighted Lord Marney to see  his name among the contributors to all sectarian institutions. The vicar  of Marney, who had been presented by himself, was his model of a priest:  he left every body alone. Under the influence of Lady Marney, the worthy  vicar had once warmed up into some ebullition of very low church zeal;  there was some talk of an evening lecture, the schools were to be  remodelled, certain tracts were actually distributed. But Lord Marney  soon stopped all this. \"No priestcraft at Marney,\" said this gentle  proprietor of abbey lands.    \"I wanted very much to come and canvass for you,\" said Lady Marney to  Egremont, \"but George did not like it.\"    \"The less the family interfered the better,\" said Lord Marney; \"and for  my part, I was very much alarmed when I heard my mother had gone down.\"    \"Oh! my mother did wonders,\" said Egremont: \"we should have been beat  without her. Indeed, to tell the truth, I quite gave up the thing the  moment they started their man. Before that we were on velvet; but the  instant he appeared everything was changed, and I found some of my  warmest supporters, members of his committee.\"    \"You had a formidable opponent, Lord Marney told me,\" said Sir Vavasour.  \"Who was he?\"    \"Oh! a dreadful man! A Scotchman, richer than Croesus, one McDruggy,  fresh from Canton, with a million of opium in each pocket, denouncing  corruption, and bellowing free trade.\"    \"But they do not care much for free trade in the old borough?\" said Lord  Marney.    \"No, it was a mistake,\" said Egremont, \"and the cry was changed the  moment my opponent was on the ground. Then all the town was placarded  with 'Vote for McDruggy and our young Queen,' as if he had coalesced  with her Majesty.\"    \"My mother must have been in despair,\" said Lord Marney.    \"We issued our placard instantly of 'Vote for our young Queen and  Egremont,' which was at least more modest, and turned out more popular.\"    \"That I am sure was my mother,\" said Lord Marney.    \"No,\" said Egremont; \"it was the effusion of a far more experienced  mind. My mother was in hourly communication with head quarters, and Mr  Taper sent down the cry by express.\"    \"Peel, in or out, will support the Poor Law,\" said Lord Marney, rather  audaciously, as he reseated himself after the ladies had retired. \"He  must;\" and he looked at his brother, whose return had in a great degree  been secured by crying that Poor Law down.    \"It is impossible,\" said Charles, fresh from the hustings, and speaking  from the card of Taper, for the condition of the people was a subject of  which he knew nothing.    \"He will carry it out,\" said Lord Marney, \"you'll see, or the land will  not support him.\"    \"I wish,\" said Sir Vavasour, \"we could manage some modification about  out-door relief.\"    \"Modification!\" said Lord Marney; \"why there has been nothing but  modification. What we want is stringency.\"    \"The people will never bear it,\" said Egremont; \"there must be some  change.\"    \"You cannot go back to the abuses of the old system,\" said Captain  Grouse, making, as he thought, a safe observation.    \"Better go back to the old system, than modify the new,\" said Lord  Marney.    \"I wish the people would take to it a little more,\" said Sir Vavasour;  \"they certainly do not like it in our parish.\"    \"The people are very contented here, eh Slimsey?\" said Lord Marney.    \"Very,\" said the vicar.    Hereupon a conversation took place, principally sustained by the  earl and the baronet, which developed all the resources of the great  parochial mind. Dietaries, bastardy, gaol regulations, game laws, were  amply discussed; and Lord Marney wound up with a declaration of the  means by which the country might be saved, and which seemed principally  to consist of high prices and low church.    \"If the sovereign could only know her best friends,\" said Sir Vavasour,  with a sigh.    Lord Marney seemed to get uneasy.    \"And avoid the fatal mistakes of her predecessor,\" continued the  baronet.    \"Charles, another glass of claret,\" said the earl.    \"She might yet rally round the throne a body of men\"--    \"Then we will go to the ladies,\" said the earl, abruptly disturbing his  guest.          Book 2 Chapter 2        There was music as they re-entered the drawing-room. Sir Vavasour  attached himself to Egremont.    \"It is a great pleasure for me to see you again, Mr Egremont;\" said  the worthy baronet. \"Your father was my earliest and kindest friend. I  remember you at Firebrace, a very little boy. Happy to see you again,  Sir, in so eminent a position; a legislator--one of our legislators. It  gave me a sincere satisfaction to observe your return.\"    \"You are very kind, Sir Vavasour.\"    \"But it is a responsible position,\" continued the baronet. \"Think you  they'll stand? A majority. I suppose, they have; but, I conclude, in  time; Sir Robert will have it in time? We must not be in a hurry; 'the  more haste'--you know the rest. The country is decidedly conservative.  All that we want now is a strong government, that will put all things to  rights. If the poor king had lived--\"    \"He would have sent these men to the right-abouts;\" said Egremont, a  young politician, proud of his secret intelligence.    \"Ah! the poor king!\" said Sir Vavasour, shaking his head.    \"He was entirely with us,\" said Egremont.    \"Poor man\" said Sir Vavasour.    \"You think it was too late, then?\" said his companion.    \"You are a young man entering political life,\" said the baronet, taking  Egremont kindly by the arm, and leading him to a sofa; \"everything  depends on the first step. You have a great opportunity. Nothing can be  done by a mere individual. The most powerful body in this country wants  a champion.\"    \"But you can depend on Peel?\" said Egremont.    \"He is one of us: we ought to be able to depend on him. But I have  spoken to him for an hour, and could get nothing out of him.\"    \"He is cautious; but depend upon it, he will stand or fall by the land.\"    \"I am not thinking of the land,\" said Sir Vavasour; \"of something much  more important; with all the influence of the land, and a great deal  more besides; of an order of men who are ready to rally round the  throne, and are, indeed, if justice were done to them, its natural and  hereditary champions (Egremont looked perplexity); I am speaking,\" added  Sir Vavasour, in a solemn voice, \"I am speaking of the baronets.\"    \"The baronets! And what do they want?\"    \"Their rights; their long withheld rights. The poor king was with us. He  has frequently expressed to me and other deputies, his determination to  do us justice; but he was not a strong-minded man,\" said Sir Vavasour,  with a sigh; \"and in these revolutionary and levelling times, he had  a hard task perhaps. And the peers, who are our brethren, they were,  I fear, against us. But in spite of the ministers, and in spite of the  peers, had the poor king lived, we should at least have had the badge,\"  added Sir Vavasour mournfully.    \"The badge!\"    \"It would have satisfied Sir Grosvenor le Draughte,\" said Sir Vavasour;  \"and he had a strong party with him; he was for compromise, but d-- him,  his father was only an accoucheur.\"    \"And you wanted more?\" inquired Egremont, with a demure look.    \"All, or nothing,\" said Sir Vavasour; \"principle is ever my motto--no  expediency.
