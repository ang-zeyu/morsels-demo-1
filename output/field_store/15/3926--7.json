At the French factory I found the employés well \"up\" in the  travels of the unfortunate adventurer Douville (\"Voyage au Congo  et dans l'Intérieur de l'Afrique Equinoxiale fait dans les années  1828, 1829, et 1830. Par J. B. Douville, Secrétaire de la Société  de Géographic de Paris pour l'année 1832, etmembre de plusieurs  Sociétés savantes françoises et étrangères. Ouvrage auquel la  Société de Géographic a décerné le prix dans sa séance du 30  mars, 1832. 3 tomes. 8vo. Paris, 1832\"). Dr. Gardner, in his  Brazilian travels, gives an account of Douville's murder, the  consequence of receiving too high fees for medical attendance on  the banks of the São Francisco. So life like are his descriptions  of the country and its scenery, that no one in the factory would  believe him to have been an impostor, and the Frenchmen evidently  held my objections to be \"founded on nationality.\" The besetting  sins of the three volumes are inordinate vanity and  inconséquence, but these should not obscure our vision as to  their solid and remarkable merits. Compare the picturesque  account of São Paulo with those of the latest English travellers,  and the anthropology of the people, their religion, their  ceremonies, their magic, their dress and costume, their trade,  their manufactures, their maladies (including earth-eating),  their cannibalism, the condition of their women, and the  necessity of civilizing them by education before converting them,  all subjects of the highest interest, with that of Mungo Park,  for instance, arid we have a fair measure of the French  traveller's value. The native words inserted into the text are  for the most part given with unusual correctness, and the carping  criticism which would correct them sadly requires correction  itself. \"Thus the word which he writes mouloundu in his text, and  mulundu in his vocabulary, is not singular, as he supposes, but  the plural of loondu, a mountain\" (p. 200 of the\" Review\").  Firstly, Douville has warned the reader that the former is the  spelling best adapted to French, the latter to Portuguese.  Secondly, \"mulundu\" in Angolan is singular, the plural being  \"milundu\"--a handful, the Persians say, is a specimen of the  heap. The excess of female births in low and unhealthy places (1,  309) and as the normal result of polygamy (3, 243), is a highly  interesting subject still awaiting investigation. I do not mean  that Douville was the first to observe this phenomenon, which  forced itself upon the notice of physiologists in ancient times.  Foster (\"Cook's Third Voyage\") remarks that, wherever men and  animals have many females, the feminine births preponderate over  the masculine; a fact there explained by the \"organic molecule\"  of Buffon. Pigafetta, the circumnavigator, gives the King of  Tidor eighteen daughters to eight sons.    The French traveller does not pretend to be a mineralogist, but  he does his best to lay open the metallic riches of the country;  he gives careful observations of temperature, in water as well as  air, he divines the different proportions of oxygen in the  atmosphere, and he even applies himself to investigating the  comparative heat of the negro's blood, an inquiry still far from  being exhausted. The most remarkable part is certainly the  medical, and here the author was simply in advance of his age.  Instead of the lancet, the drastic cathartics, and the calomel  with which our naval surgeons slew their patients, he employed  emetics and tonics to an extent that would have charmed my late  friend, Dr. Dickson, the chromothermalist, and he preceded Dr.  Hutchinson in the use of quinine wine. Indeed, the peculiar  aptitude for medicine shown in these pages led to the traveller's  adopting the destructive art of healing as a profession, and  caused his unhappy end. The curious mixture of utter imposture  and of genius for observation which a traveller can detect in  Douville renders him worthy of a monograph.                                      Chapter VI.    Up the Congo River.--the Slave Depot, Porto Da Lenha.--arrival at                               Boma.        M. Parrot was as good as his word. By August 31st, \"L'Espérance,\"  a fine schooner-rigged palhabote (launch) of thirty-five tons,  heavily sparred and carrying lots of \"muslin,\" was ready to  receive my outfit. The party consisted of the commander, Mr.  Bigley, and five chosen \"Griffons,\" including William Deane,  boatswain's mate, as good a man as his namesake in Blake's day,  and the estimable Friend, captain's cook and Figaro in general.  M. Pissot, an Arlésien, clerk to the factory, went up on business  with a crew of eight useless Cabindas under Frank, their pagan  \"patron,\" who could only run us aground. Finally, there was a  guard of half-a-dozen \"Laptots,\" equally good sailors and  soldiers. The French squadron in West Africa has the advantage  over ours of employing these men,    086--- who are clean, intelligent, and brave; whilst we are  reduced to the unprogressive Kru-man, who is, moreover, a model  coward, a poltroon on principle.    At 5 P.M. our huge canvas drove us rapidly over the shoals and  shallows of this imperfectly known sea: the Ethiopic Directory  justly grumbles, \"It is a subject of regret that navigators who  have had occasion to enter the Congo, and to remain there some  time, have not furnished us with more information about the  tides.\" This will be a work of labour and endurance; detached  observations are of very little use. We at once remarked the  complication caused by the upper, surface, or freshwater current  of 3 to 4 knots an hour, meeting the under, or oceanic inflow.  There is a short cut up Pirate's Creek, but we avoided it for the  usual reason, fear of finding it very long. Passing a low point  to port, subtended north and south by the Bananal River and  Pirate's Creek, after some six knots we were abreast of  Bulambemba (the Boulem beembo of Tuckey's Vocabulary). It is  interpreted \"Answer,\" hence our \"Echo Point\"(?); but others  render it, \"Hold your tongue.\" The former is correct, and the  thick high screen of trees explains the native and English names.  Old writers call it Fathomless Point, which it is not now; a  bank, the south-eastern projection of the great Mwáná Mázia  shoal, has formed a few feet below the surface; but the term will  apply at the distance of a mile further south. This acute angle  shows a glorious clump, the \"Tall Trees,\" white mangroves rising  a hundred feet, and red mangroves based upon pyramidal cages of  roots; and beyond it the immediate shore is covered with a dense  tropical vegetation, a tangle of bush, palms, and pandanus,  matted with creepers and undergrowth, and rhyzophoras of many  varieties delighting in brackish water. We passed on the right  the Ponta de Jacaré (Point of the Crocodile), fronting Point  Senegal on the other side. The natives call the former Ngándu  (li. Jigándu), and farcical tales are told about it: in the lower  settlements Europeans will not go abroad by night without a  lantern. During my trip I sighted only one startled crocodile  that floated log-like a mile off, and Captain Baak, of the Dutch  house, had not seen one during a whole year at Banana Point.    We anchored for the night off the south side of the Zungá chyá  Ngombe, in Portuguese Ilha do Boi (Bullock), the Rhinoceros  Island of our early charts. It emerges from the waters of the  right bank, a mere \"ponton\" plumed with dark mangroves and  streaked with spar-like white trunks. This is probably the  \"Island of Horses,\" where the Portuguese, flying from the  victorious Hollanders, were lodged and fed by the courteous Count  of Sonho; perhaps it is Battel's \"Isle Calabes.\" The place is  backed by the Monpanga or Mombang, the \"Look-out Islands\" of the  chart, which has greatly changed since the beginning of the  century; the dark mass of mangroves is now apparently part of the  northern shore. Almost due south of the Ilha do Boi is the Zungá  chyá Kampenzi, whence our word chimpanzee: in the hydrographic  chart it is miswritten Zoonga Campendi, and in Tuckey's map,  which contradicts his text, \"Zoonga Casaquoisa.\" His \"Zoonga  Kampenzey,\" also named \"Halcyon Island,\" appears to be the  Draper's Island or the \"Monkey Island\" of Mr. Maxwell: the latter  in modern charts is more to the north-east, that is, above Porto  da Lenha, than the former. The Simiads have been killed out;  Captain Tuckey going up the river saw upwards of twenty which,  but for their tails, might have been mistaken for negroes.  Merolla says that wild men and women (gorillas?) have been  captured in Sonho, and he carefully distinguishes them from  baboons: one of them was presented to a friar of his order, who  \"bestowed it on the Portuguese governor of Loanda.\" Chimpanzee  Island may be the Zariacacongo of Father Merolla, who makes  Cacongo (Great Congo) a large and independent kingdom\" lying in  the middle between Congo and Loango.\" He describes Zariacacongo,  \"none of the smallest, and situate in the midst of the River  Zaire.\" It abounded in all sorts of provisions, was well peopled,  consisted of a plain raised eight fathoms above water, and was  divided from the kingdom of Congo by a river, over which there  was a bridge.    After a pleasant breezy night upon the brown waters, on September  1st we hove anchor betimes and made for Scotchman's Head, a  conspicuous mangrove bluff forming a fine landmark on the left  bank. The charts have lately shifted it some two miles west of  its old position. Six or seven miles beyond it rise the blue  uplands of the \"Earldom of Sonho.\" On our right, in mid-stream,  lay a \"crocodile bank,\" a newly fixed grass "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#11)"],[1,"to verb, ala, _alamai_; _fatola_,  _fatolamai_.
