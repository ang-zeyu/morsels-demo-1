They do not pay the least perceptible adoration to images. Their      ceremonies in their religious worship accord more nearly with the      Mosaic institutions, which could not be if they were of heathen      descent. * * * * * Their opinion that God chose them out of all the      rest of mankind as his peculiar and beloved people, fills both the      white Jew and the red American, with that steady hatred against      all the world, which renders them hated and despised by all. We      have abundant evidence of the Jews believing in the ministration      of angels, during the Old Testament dispensation, their frequent      appearances and their services on earth, are recorded in the      oracles, which the Jews themselves receive as given by divine      inspiration, and St. Paul in his epistle addressed to the Hebrews      speaks of it as their general opinion that \"angels are ministering      spirits to the good and righteous on earth.\" The Indian sentiments      and traditions are the same. They believe the higher regions to      be inhabited by good spirits, relations to the Great Holy One,      and that these spirits attend and favor the virtuous. The Indian      language and dialects appear to have the very idiom and genius of      the Hebrew. Their words and sentences are expressive, concise,      emphatical, sonorous, and bold, and often both in letters and      signification synonymous with the Hebrew language. They count time      after the manner of the Hebrews, reckoning years by lunar months      like the Israelites who counted by moons. The religious ceremonies      of the Indian Americans are in conformity with those of the Jews,      they having their prophets, high priest, and others of religious      order. As the Jews had a sanctorum or most holy place, so have all      the Indian nations. The dress also of their high priests is similar      in character to that of the Hebrews. The festivals, feasts, and      religious rites of the Indian Americans have also great resemblance      to that of the Hebrews. The Indian imitates the Israelite in      his religious offerings. The Hebrews had various ablutions and      anointings according to the Mosaic ritual--and all the Indian      nations constantly observe similar customs from religious motives.      Their frequent bathing, or dipping themselves and their children      in rivers, even in the severest weather, seems to be as truly      Jewish as the other rites and ceremonies which have been mentioned.      The Indian laws of uncleanliness and purification, and also the      abstaining from things deemed unclean are the same as those of      the Hebrews. The Indian marriages, divorces and punishments of      adultery, still retain a strong likeness to the Jewish laws and      customs on these points. Many of the Indian punishments resemble      those of the Jews. Whoever attentively views the features of the      Indian, and his eye and reflects on his fickle, obstinate, and      cruel disposition will naturally think of the Jews. The ceremonies      performed by the Indians before going to war, such as purification      and fasting, are similar to those of the Hebrew nation. The      Israelites were fond of wearing beads and other ornaments, even as      early as the patriarchal age and in resemblance to these customs      the Indian females continually wear the same, believing it to be      a preventive against many evils. The Indian manner of curing the      sick is very similar to that of the Jews. Like the Hebrews, they      firmly believe that diseases and wounds are occasioned by divine      anger, in proportion to some violation of the old beloved speech.      The Hebrews carefully buried their dead, so on any accident they      gathered their bones, and laid them in tombs of their forefathers;      thus all the numerous nations of Indians perform the like friendly      office to every deceased person of their respective tribes. The      Jewish records tell us that the women mourned for the loss of their      deceased husbands, and were reckoned vile by the civil law if they      married in the space of at least ten months after their death. In      the same manner all the Indian widows, by an established strict      penal law, mourn for the loss of their deceased husbands; and among      some tribes for the space of three or four years. The surviving      brother by the Mosaic law, was to raise seed to a deceased brother,      who left a widow childless, to perpetuate his name and family. The      American law enforces the same rule. When the Israelites gave names      to their children or others they chose such appellatives as suited      best their circumstances and the times. This custom is a standing      rule with the Indians.\" [5]    There are writers upon the subject of American Antiquities who hold,  first: that not all the foregoing points of comparison between native  American races and the Hebrews are clearly established; and second:  that if they were all clearly established it would not necessarily  prove identity of race. This much, however, can be insisted upon by  those who accept the Book of Mormon as true; namely, that since no  counter theory of origin for our native American races has yet been  conclusively proven, (and as matters now stand, seems impossible of  being proven), and as the Book of Mormon makes bold to so definitely  announce the Hebrew origin of the people whose history in outline  it gives, so much in the foregoing summary of points of comparison  between the American races and the Hebrews as may not be successfully  contradicted stands as evidence of no mean order for the truth of our  Nephite record.    The Discovery of Hebrew Relics.    In addition to these summaries of evidence on the Hebrew origin of the  native American races there are several special discoveries bearing on  the subject that I think should be mentioned. One is related by Ethan  Smith, author of \"Views of the Hebrews,\" a work in which he undertakes  to prove that the American Indians are descendants of the Ten Lost  Tribes of Israel. While preparing his work for a second edition, he  heard of the discovery in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, of a parchment,  supposed to be of native American origin, covered with Hebrew  characters. Mr. Smith went to Pittsfield to investigate the matter, and  found the facts to be as follows, the information being given by the  man who found the parchment:    I.    _The Pittsfield Hebrew Parchment._        This [the discoverer of the parchment] was Joseph Merrick, Esq.,      a highly respectable character in the church of Pittsfield, and      in the county, as the minister of the place informed [me]. Mr.      Merrick gave the following account; that in 1815, he was leveling      some ground under and near an old wood shed standing on a place of      his, situated on Indian Hill, (a place in Pittsfield, so called,      and lying, as the writer was afterward informed, at some distance      from the middle of the town where Mr. Merrick is now [about 1825]      living). He ploughed and conveyed away old chips and earth, to      some depth, as the surface of the earth appeared uneven. After the      work was done, walking over the place, he discovered, near where      the earth had been dug the deepest, a kind of black strap, about      six inches in length, and one and a half in breadth, and something      thicker than a draw leather [tug] of a harness. He perceived it had      at each end a loop of some hard substance, probably for the purpose      of carrying it. He conveyed it into his house, and threw it in an      old tool box. He afterward found it thrown out of doors, and again      conveyed it to the box. He attempted to cut it open, and found it      was formed of pieces of thick raw hide, sewed and made water tight      with the sinews of some animal; and in the fold it contained four      folded leaves of old parchment. These leaves were of a dark yellow,      and contained some kind of writing. Some of the neighbors saw and      examined them. One of these parchments they tore in pieces; the      other three he saved, and delivered them to Mr. Sylvester Larned,      a graduate then in town, who took them to Cambridge, and had them      examined. They were written in Hebrew with a pen, in plain and      intelligible writing. The following is an extract of a letter sent      to Mr. Merrick by Mr. Larned, upon this subject:        Sir:--I have examined the parchment manuscript, which you had the      goodnesss to give me. After some time and with much difficulty and      assistance I have ascertained their meaning, which is as follows:      (I have numbered the manuscripts.)        No. 1, is translated by Duet. vi: 4-9 verses inclusive.        No. 2, by Deut, xi: 13-21 verses inclusive.        No. 3, Exod. xiii: 11-16 verses inclusive.        I am, etc. [Signed] SYLVESTER LARNED. [6]    II.    _The Newark Hebrew Tablet._    Another discovery of Hebrew writing--the Ten Commandments engraved on a  stone tablet--was made in Ohio; and was seen by Mr. A. A. Bancroft, the  father of H. H. Bancroft, author of \"Native Races.\" The latter relates  the circumstances of finding this relic as follows:        About eight miles southeast of Newark there was formerly a large      mound composed of masses of free stone, which had been brought from      some distance and thrown into a heap without much placing or care.      In early days, stone being scarce in that region, the settlers      carried away the mound piece by piece to use for building purposes,      so that in a few years there was little more than a large flattened      heap of rubbish remaining. Some fifteen years ago, the county      surveyor (I have forgotten his name), who had for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],[0,"The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#11)"],[1,"and would turn again and rend those who presented the truth to  them. Except, therefore, in things of this sacred character which he  was commanded of the Lord to make known, he kept them to himself. So  he and Oliver hid within their breasts the fact of John's visitation  and their baptism, and the joy arising therefrom. Yet, notwithstanding  their caution, every step taken by the Prophet in fulfillment of God's  purposes in this dispensation, however quietly he had acted, had been  followed quickly by a new outburst of persecution. The dawn of a new  era was visible, and the evil one must exert every power he possessed  to becloud the minds of men. The hatred of the people dwelling in the  vicinity of Harmony was kindled, unaccountably even to themselves,  against the two young men. A mob spirit reigned in the neighborhood;  and a murderous attack upon Joseph and Oliver was only prevented by the  influence of Isaac Hale and his family, who gave sympathy and help at  this hour to the Prophet.    Joseph and Oliver, in the midst of their labors, did not fail to pray  for that help and guidance which they needed. From the record itself  they gathered a large store of religious truths; and their minds being  opened to comprehend the principles of salvation, they also searched  the other scriptures, the Old and New Testaments, with great profit  to themselves. As a result, much blessing came to them through their  devotion and industry. Joseph's concentration upon the work entrusted  to him had such effect upon members of the Hale family, that they  united in giving to him the assurance that he should be protected from  the mob; and that he should be saved from all unlawful persecution, so  far as their influence and strength could avail to defend him. The also  extended to Oliver a promise to similarly protect him so long as he  remained to assist Joseph.    After a little time, the spirit led the Prophet to impart to his  friends and acquaintances some of the information which he had gained.  Though at this time he was far from possessing the comprehension of  the truth which he afterwards had, he was still rich in knowledge and  blessings, compared with the people who surrounded him, and who were  enthralled by the ignorance and intolerance which had been growing  through all the ages since the ruin of the early church.        CHAPTER X.    THE PROPHET'S BROTHER SAMUEL BAPTIZED BY OLIVER--RENEWED DANGER TO  THE WORK--HELP FROM FAYETTE--MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITION TO AID DAVID  WHITMER--HYRUM SMITH AND OTHERS BELIEVE AND ARE BAPTIZED.    While thus busily engaged, Samuel H. Smith, a brother of Joseph, came  down from Manchester to Harmony. Joseph proclaimed to him the truth,  so far as it had been revealed; presented to his view the translation  of the Book of Mormon, so far as it had been completed; and then  besought him to gain by prayer to Almighty God, a knowledge for himself  concerning the divine origin of that which he had heard and seen.  Samuel, a man of integrity and singleness and fixity of purpose, was  not easily convinced. Finally, however, he consented to ask for light  from Heaven. For this purpose he retired to the woods and humbled  himself in supplication before the Lord. A convincing answer came to  his prayer, and he hastened to Joseph with his tidings of joy. At the  request of the Prophet, Oliver Cowdery administered to Samuel in the  ordinance of baptism for the remission of his sins, and later he was  confirmed. The same signs followed in this case; and Samuel was filled  with the spirit of prophecy and praise. He uttered many sublime truths  of which his mind up to that moment had never conceived. Desiring that  his kindred might be made partakers of his joy, he journeyed quickly  back to Manchester to give to the family the news of Joseph's extended  calling. Hyrum Smith came to Harmony immediately afterward to inquire  of Joseph concerning these wondrous things. The young Prophet declared  to his elder brother that an angel from Heaven had restored to earth  the power to baptize for the remission of human sin; and that himself  and Oliver had been made the recipients of this authority.    Hyrum Smith was a noble man, filled with earnest desire for truth and  holiness. He asked Joseph to obtain further light, and at his request  the Prophet solicited a direct revelation from the Lord, on Hyrum's  behalf. The desire was answered in a revelation given to Hyrum, through  the Prophet. In that revelation, these words occur:        Hyrum, my son, seek the Kingdom of God, and all things shall be      added according to that which is just. Build upon my rock, which      is my Gospel. Deny not the Spirit of Revelation nor the Spirit of      Prophecy; for woe unto him that denieth these things.    Hyrum believed and awaited the proper hour for baptism.    While the light of truth was thus breaking upon the world, all the  powers of hell allied themselves against it, with the determination  that it should be extinguished. Mobs increased in strength and hatred.  Added to this constant menace, Joseph once more found himself almost  destitute of means. He would soon have been compelled to relinquish the  glorious work of translation to engage again in manual toil for the  sustenance of his family and to provide maintenance for himself and  Oliver, had not Providence again raised up a friend to come to his aid.    In this eventful month of May, 1829, a man named Joseph Knight appeared  at Harmony and sought out the Prophet. Mr. Knight had heard of Joseph's  work and desired to contribute out of his means to the progress of the  cause. He brought food and such other comforts as would enable the  Prophet to continue his work of translation without being interrupted.  Not only upon this occasion, but more than once subsequently, Joseph  Knight journeyed from his home in Broome County, New York, a distance  of thirty miles, to bring supplies to the Prophet's house.    Also in this month of May, Joseph received a revelation from God  instructing him that the manuscript lost by Martin Harris had fallen  into the hands of wicked men, who had made alterations with intent to  bring shame and confusion upon Joseph, and distrust upon the word of  the Lord; that the portion which was thus lost and changed was only a  translation of an abridgment of certain records; and that, instead of  translating once more this part of the work, Joseph should translate  the record of the original plates from which the abridgment had been  made--thus giving a more complete presentation of that portion of  the history and thus preventing the wicked from bringing forth their  forgery and casting discredit upon the Prophet by its means.    But the persecution did not cease, and the mobs seemed to be gathering  their forces with some definite determination. At the opening of the  month of June, 1829, immediate danger threatened the Prophet and his  charge. But at this time a young man, calling himself David Whitmer,  presented himself at the residence of Joseph and announced that he  came with a message from his father, Peter Whitmer, of Fayette, Seneca  County, New York. The message was an invitation from the elder Whitmer  to Joseph, requesting him to remove with his work and his assistant  to Fayette and there enjoy the hospitality of the Whitmers and the  protection which they would be able to afford him, until his labor  could be completed.    The young man David also related to Joseph a marvelous interposition  which had enabled him to deliver his message so early. When David  first felt an impression that he ought to journey to Harmony in search  of Joseph, he questioned the wisdom of such a course; because his  farm-work was in such a condition that much loss must ensue, he feared,  if he departed at a time apparently so inopportune. He was pondering  his doubts upon the subject, when he was instructed by the whispering  of the Spirit that his duty required him to go down to Harmony as soon  as his field labor should reach a certain state. He toiled during the  ensuing day to harrow in the wheat of a large field; and at night  he found that he had done more in a few hours than he could usually  accomplish in two or three days. The next morning he went out to spread  plaster, according to the custom of that region, upon another field.  When he reached the spot where he had formerly deposited large heaps  of the plaster, he found that it had been carried upon the field and  spread just as he would have laid it by his own hand. He marveled much.  His sister dwelt near the place and he asked her who had done the work.  She answered him that three strangers had appeared at the field the day  previous and had scattered the plaster with wonderful skill and speed.  She and her children had viewed with amazement the progress made by the  men; but she had said nothing to them as they were strangers, and she  presumed that David had employed them to help him through his rush of  work.    Both Peter Whitmer and his son regarded these events as miraculous  interpositions to aid David to hasten down into Pennsylvania. The young  man therefore departed with his horses and wagon the next morning and  journeyed to Harmony, a distance, as traveled, of one hundred and fifty  miles, in two days.    This aid came providentially; and Joseph, after receiving instruction  in answer to prayer, accepted the invitation. When the Prophet was  prepared to depart from Harmony, he asked the Lord to direct the  manner in which the plates should be carried to Fayette. He was told  in response that the angel would receive the treasures; and after the  arrival of Joseph at the home of Peter Whitmer in Fayette, would again  deliver them into his hands. Thus relieved, Joseph went serenely forth;  and in a few days he was safe in Fayette. In the garden adjoining the  Whitmer residence, the Prophet was visited by the angel and once more  was placed in"]]]
