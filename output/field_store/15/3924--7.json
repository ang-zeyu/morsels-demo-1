When aeroplanes came over bombing, the dynamos used to stop for they  supplied light to other places besides the cinema, and the shade of  Charlie Chaplin would fade away. But the men would wait till the  aeroplanes had gone and that famous figure came waddling back to the  screen. There he amused tired men newly come from the trenches, there  he brought laughter to most of the twelve days that they had out of  the line.    He is gone from Behagnies now. He did not march in the retreat a  little apart from the troops, with head bent forward and hand thrust  in jacket, a flat-footed Napoleon: yet he is gone; for no one would  have left behind for the enemy so precious a thing as a Charlie  Chaplin film. He is gone but he will return. He will come with his  cane one day along that Arras road to the old hut in Behagnies; and  men dressed in brown will welcome him there again.    He will pass beyond it through those desolate plains, and over the  hills beyond them, beyond Bapaume. Far hamlets to the east will know  his antics.    And one day surely, in old familiar garb, without court dress, without  removing his hat, armed with that flexible cane, he will walk over the  faces of the Prussian Guard and, picking up the Kaiser by the collar,  with infinite nonchalance in finger and thumb, will place him neatly  in a prone position and solemnly sit on his chest.          The Oases of Death      While the German guns were pounding Amiens and the battle of dull  Prussianism against Liberty raged on, they buried Richthofen in the  British lines.    They had laid him in a large tent with his broken machine outside it.  Thence British airmen carried him to the quiet cemetery, and he was  buried among the cypresses in this old resting place of French  generations just as though he had come there bringing no harm to  France.    Five wreaths were on his coffin, placed there by those who had fought  against him up in the air. And under the wreaths on the coffin was  spread the German flag.    When the funeral service was over three volleys were fired by the  escort, and a hundred aviators paid their last respects to the grave  of their greatest enemy; for the chivalry that the Prussians have  driven from earth and sea lives on in the blue spaces of the air.    They buried Richthofen at evening, and the planes came droning home as  they buried him, and the German guns roared on and guns answered,  defending Amiens. And in spite of all, the cemetery had the air of  quiet, remaining calm and aloof, as all French graveyards are. For  they seem to have no part in the cataclysm that shakes all the world  but them; they seem to withdraw amongst memories and to be aloof from  time, and, above all, to be quite untroubled by the war that rages  to-day, upon which they appear to look out listlessly from among their  cypress and yew, and dimly, down a vista of centuries. They are very  strange, these little oases of death that remain unmoved and green  with their trees still growing, in the midst of a desolation as far as  the eye can see, in which cities and villages and trees and hedges and  farms and fields and churches are all gone, and where hugely broods a  desert. It is as though Death, stalking up and down through France for  four years, sparing nothing, had recognized for his own his little  gardens, and had spared only them.          Anglo-Saxon Tyranny      \"We need a sea,\" says Big-Admiral von Tirpitz, \"freed of  Anglo-Saxon tyranny.\" Unfortunately neither the British Admiralty nor  the American Navy permit us to know how much of the Anglo-Saxon  tyranny is done by American destroyers and how much by British ships  and even trawler. It would interest both countries to know, if it  could be known. But the Big-Admiral is unjust to France, for the  French navy exerts a tyranny at sea that can by no means be  overlooked, although naturally from her position in front of the mouth  of the Elbe England practises the culminating insupportable tyranny of  keeping the High Seas Fleet in the Kiel Canal.    It is not I, but the Big-Admiral, who chose the word tyranny as  descriptive of the activities of the Anglo-Saxon navies. He was making  a speech at Dusseldorf on May 25th and was reported in the  Dusseldorfer Nachrichten on May 27th.    Naturally it does not seem like tyranny to us, even the contrary; but  for an admiral, ein Grosse-Admiral, lately commanding a High Seas  Fleet, it must have been more galling than we perhaps can credit to be  confined in a canal. There was he, who should have been breasting the  blue, or at any rate doing something salty and nautical, far out in  the storms of that sea that the Germans call an Ocean, with the  hurricane raging angrily in his whiskers and now and then wafting  tufts of them aloft to white the halyards; there was he constrained to  a command the duties of which however nobly he did them could be  equally well carried out by any respectable bargee. He hoped for a  piracy of which the Lusitania was merely a beginning; he looked for  the bombardment of innumerable towns; he pictured slaughter in many a  hamlet of fishermen; he planned more than all those things of which  U-boat commanders are guilty; he saw himself a murderous old man,  terrible to seafarers, and a scourge of the coasts, and fancied  himself chronicled in after years by such as told dark tales of  Captain Kidd or the awful buccaneers; but he followed in the end no  more desperate courses than to sit and watch his ships on a wharf near  Kiel like one of Jacob's night watchmen.    No wonder that what appears to us no more than the necessary  protection of women and children in seacoast towns from murder should  be to him an intolerable tyranny. No wonder that the guarding of  travellers of the allied countries at sea, and even those of the  neutrals, should be a most galling thing to the Big-Admiral's thwarted  ambition, looking at it from the point of view of one who to  white-whiskered age has retained the schoolboy's natural love of the  black and yellow flag. A pirate, he would say, has as much right to  live as wasps or tigers. The Anglo-Saxon navies, he might argue, have  a certain code of rules for use at sea; they let women get first into  the boats, for instance, when ships are sinking, and they rescue  drowning mariners when they can: no actual harm in all this, he would  feel, though it would weaken you, as Hindenburg said of poetry; but if  all these little rules are tyrannously enforced on those who may think  them silly, what is to become of the pirate? Where, if people like  Beattie and Sims had always had their way, would be those rollicking  tales of the jolly Spanish Main, and men walking the plank into the  big blue sea, and long, low, rakish craft putting in to Indian  harbours with a cargo of men and women all hung from the yard-arm? A  melancholy has come over the spirit of Big-Admiral von Tirpitz in the  years he has spent in the marshes between the Elbe and Kiel, and in  that melancholy he sees romance crushed; he sees no more pearl  earrings and little gold rings in the hold, he sees British  battleships spoiling the Spanish Main, and hateful American cruisers  in the old Sargasso Sea; he sees himself, alas, the last of all the  pirates.    Let him take comfort. There were always pirates. And in spite of the  tyranny of England and America, and of France, which the poor old man  perplexed with his troubles forgot, there will be pirates still. Not  many perhaps, but enough U-boats will always be able to slip through  that tyrannous blockade to spread indiscriminate slaughter amongst the  travellers of any nation, enough to hand on the old traditions of  murder at sea. And one day Captain Kidd, with such a bow as they used  to make in ports of the Spanish Main, will take off his ancient hat,  sweeping it low in Hell, and be proud to clasp the hand of the Lord of  the Kiel Canal.          Memories        ... far-off things       And battles long ago.      Those who live in an old house are necessarily more concerned with  paying the plumber, should his art be required, or choosing wall paper  that does not clash with the chintzes, than with the traditions that  may haunt its corridors. In Ireland,--and no one knows how old that  is, for the gods that lived there before the Red Branch came wrote few  chronicles on the old grey Irish stones and wrote in their own  language,--in Ireland we are more concerned with working it so that  Tim Flanagan gets the job he does be looking for.    But in America those who remember Ireland remember her, very often,  from old generations; maybe their grandfather migrated, perhaps his  grandfather, and Ireland is remembered by old tales treasured among  them. Now Tim Flanagan will not be remembered in a year's time when he  has the job for which he has got us to agitate, and the jobberies that  stir us move not the pen of History.    But the tales that Irish generations hand down beyond the Atlantic  have to be tales that are worth remembering. They are tales that have  to stand the supreme test, tales that a child will listen to by the  fireside of an evening, so that they go down with those early  remembered evenings that are last of all to go of the memories of a  lifetime. A tale that a child will listen to must have much grandeur.  Any cheap stuff will do for us, bad journalism, and novels by girls  that could get no other jobs; but a child looks for those things in a  tale that are simple and noble and epic, the things that Earth  remembers. And so they tell, over there, tales of Sarsfield and of the  old Irish Brigade; they tell, of an evening, of Owen Roe O'Neill. And  into those tales come the plains of Flanders again and the ancient  towns of France, towns famous long ago and famous yet: let us rather  think of them as famous names and not as the sad ruins we have seen,  melancholy by day and monstrous in the moonlight.

They  are all over bristles,\" said Mr.  Jackson, wiping his mouth with  his coat sleeve.    \"Get out, you nasty old toad!\" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.    \"I shall go distracted!\" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.    She shut herself up in the nut  cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out  the bees-nest. He seemed to have  no objection to stings.    When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured  to come out--everybody  had gone away.    But the untidiness was something  dreadful--\"Never did I see  such a mess--smears of honey;  and moss, and thistledown--and  marks of big and little dirty feet--  all over my nice clean house!\"      She gathered up the moss  and the remains of the bees-  wax.    Then she went out and  fetched some twigs, to partly  close up the front door.    \"I will make it too small for  Mr. Jackson!\"    She fetched soft soap, and  flannel, and a new scrubbing  brush from the storeroom.  But she was too tired to do any  more. First she fell asleep in  her chair, and then she went  to bed.    \"Will it ever be tidy again?\"  said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.      Next morning she got up  very early and began a spring  cleaning which lasted a fort-  night.    She swept, and scrubbed,  and dusted; and she rubbed  up the furniture with bees-  wax, and polished her little tin  spoons.    When it was all beautifully  neat and clean, she gave a  party to five other little mice,  without Mr. Jackson.    He smelt the party and  came up the bank, but he  could not squeeze in at the  door.      So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window,  and he was not at all offended.    He sat outside in the sun, and said--\"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very  good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!\"        THE TALE OF  TIMMY TIPTOES    [For Many Unknown Little Friends,  Including Monica]          Once upon a time there was a  little fat comfortable grey squirrel,  called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a  nest thatched with leaves in the  top of a tall tree; and he had a  little squirrel wife called Goody.    Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying  the breeze; he whisked his tail and  chuckled--\"Little wife Goody, the  nuts are ripe; we must lay up a  store for winter and spring.\"  Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing  moss under the thatch--\"The nest  is so snug, we shall be sound  asleep all winter.\" \"Then we shall  wake up all the thinner, when  there is nothing to eat in spring-  time,\" replied prudent Timothy.      When Timmy and Goody  Tiptoes came to the nut  thicket, they found other  squirrels were there already.    Timmy took off his jacket  and hung it on a twig; they  worked away quietly by themselves.    Every day they made several  journeys and picked quantities  of nuts. They carried them  away in bags, and stored  them in several hollow  stumps near the tree where  they had built their nest.      When these stumps were full,  they began to empty the bags into  a hole high up a tree, that had  belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts  rattled down--down--down inside.    \"How shall you ever get them  out again? It is like a money box!\"  said Goody.    \"I shall be much thinner before  springtime, my love,\" said Timmy  Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.    They did collect quantities--  because they did not lose them!  Squirrels who bury their nuts in  the ground lose more than half,  because they cannot remember  the place.    The most forgetful squirrel in  the wood was called Silvertail. He  began to dig, and he could not  remember. And then he dug again  and found some nuts that did not  belong to him; and there was a  fight. And other squirrels began to  dig,--the whole wood was in  commotion!      Unfortunately, just at this time  a flock of little birds flew by, from  bush to bush, searching for green  caterpillars and spiders. There  were several sorts of little birds,  twittering different songs.    The first one sang--\"Who's bin  digging-up MY nuts? Who's-been-  digging-up MY nuts?\"    And another sang--\"Little bita  bread and-NO-cheese! Little bit-a-  bread an'-NO-cheese!\"    The squirrels followed and listened.  The first little bird flew into  the bush where Timmy and Goody  Tiptoes were quietly tying up their  bags, and it sang--\"Who's-bin  digging-up MY nuts? Who's been  digging-up MY-nuts?\"    Timmy Tiptoes went on with  his work without replying; indeed,  the little bird did not expect an  answer. It was only singing its  natural song, and it meant nothing  at all.      But when the other squirrels  heard that song, they rushed upon  Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and  scratched him, and upset his bag  of nuts. The innocent little bird  which had caused all the mischief,  flew away in a fright!    Timmy rolled over and over,  and then turned tail and fled  towards his nest, followed by  a crowd of squirrels shouting--  \"Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?\"    They caught him and dragged  him up the very same tree, where  there was the little round hole,  and they pushed him in. The hole  was much too small for Timmy  Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed  him dreadfully, it was a wonder  they did not break his ribs. \"We  will leave him here till he confesses,\"  said Silvertail Squirrel and  he shouted into the hole--\"Who's-  been-digging-up MY-nuts?\"      Timmy Tiptoes made no  reply; he had tumbled down  inside the tree, upon half a  peck of nuts belonging to  himself. He lay quite stunned and  still.    Goody Tiptoes picked up the  nut bags and went home. She  made a cup of tea for Timmy; but  he didn't come and didn't come.    Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely  and unhappy night. Next morning  she ventured back to the nut  bushes to look for him; but the  other unkind squirrels drove her  away.    She wandered all over the  wood, calling--    \"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tip-  toes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\"      In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes  came to his senses. He found  himself tucked up in a little moss  bed, very much in the dark, feeling  sore; it seemed to be under  ground. Timmy coughed and  groaned, because his ribs hurted  him. There was a chirpy noise,  and a small striped Chipmunk  appeared with a night light, and  hoped he felt better?    It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes;  it lent him its nightcap; and  the house was full of provisions.    The Chipmunk explained that it  had rained nuts through the top of  the tree--\"Besides, I found a few  buried!\" It laughed and chuckled  when it heard Timmy's story.  While Timmy was confined to  bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities  --\"But how shall I ever get out  through that hole unless I thin  myself? My wife will be anxious!\"  \"Just another nut--or two nuts;  let me crack them for you,\" said  the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes  grew fatter and fatter!      Now Goody Tiptoes had set to  work again by herself. She did not  put any more nuts into the woodpecker's  hole, because she had always  doubted how they could be  got out again. She hid them under  a tree root; they rattled down,  down, down. Once when Goody  emptied an extra big bagful, there  was a decided squeak; and next  time Goody brought another bagful,  a little striped Chipmunk  scrambled out in a hurry.    \"It is getting perfectly full-up  downstairs; the sitting room is  full, and they are rolling along the  passage; and my husband, Chippy  Hackee, has run away and left me.  What is the explanation of these  showers of nuts?\"    \"I am sure I beg your pardon; I  did not know that anybody lived  here,\" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes;  \"but where is Chippy Hackee? My  husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run  away too.\" \"I know where Chippy  is; a little bird told me,\" said Mrs.  Chippy Hackee.      She led the way to the woodpecker's  tree, and they listened at  the hole.    Down below there was a noise  of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel  voice and a thin squirrel voice  were singing together--         \"My little old man and I fell out,       How shall we bring this matter about?       Bring it about as well as you can,       And get you gone, you little old man!\"      \"You could squeeze in, through  that little round hole,\" said Goody  Tiptoes. \"Yes, I could,\" said the  Chipmunk, \"but my husband,  Chippy Hackee, bites!\"    Down below there was a noise  of cracking nuts and nibbling; and  then the fat squirrel voice and the  thin squirrel voice sang--         \"For the diddlum day       Day diddle durn di!       Day diddle diddle dum day!\"      Then Goody peeped in at the  hole, and called down--\"Timmy  Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!\"  And Timmy replied, \"Is that you,  Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!\"    He came up and kissed Goody  through the hole; but he was so fat  that he could not get out.    Chippy Hackee was not too fat,  but he did not want to come; he  stayed down below and chuckled.    And so it went on for a fort-  night; till a big wind blew off  the top of the tree, and opened  up the hole and let in the rain.    Then Timmy Tiptoes came  out, and went home with an  umbrella.      But Chippy Hackee continued  to camp out for another  week, although it was  uncomfortable.    At last a large bear came  walking through the wood.  Perhaps he also was looking  for nuts; he seemed to be  sniffing around.      Chippy Hackee went home  in a hurry!    And when Chippy Hackee  got home, he found he had  caught a cold in his head; and  he was more uncomfortable  still.      And now Timmy and  Goody Tiptoes keep their nut  store fastened up with a little  padlock.    And whenever that little  bird sees the Chipmunks, he  sings--\"Who's-been-digging-  up MY-nuts? Who's been dig-  ging-up MY-nuts?\" But nobody  ever answers!          THE TALE OF  MR. TOD    [For William Francis of Ulva--Someday!]          I have made many books about  well-behaved people.
