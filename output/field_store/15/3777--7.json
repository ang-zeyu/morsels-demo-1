VICTOR KULLBERG    The display of marine chronometers by this maker, with the Observatory  ratings, was of the very first order. Every part of those instruments  was remarkably well made, and the modifications of some of the balance  wheels worthy of special attention. Adjudged a first-class award.    The display of watches by the same maker, although small, commanded  attention from their very nice finish in all parts. As will be seen  from the report and diagram of Professor Russell, they are good  timekeepers, especially the one having the chronometer escapement.  This style of watch, however, is of too delicate construction and too  costly to fully meet the requirements of any considerable public want.  The same objection will hold good as to the lever escapements as far  as cost or economy is concerned, they being comparatively too high  priced. Representing a certain class of manufacture, they are of the  first order of merit, and adjudged a first-class award.    The \"gas governor\" exhibited by the same maker, an instrument for  regulating the amount of heat in the testing of chronometers, is  commended as a useful invention.

[page 10]    [_Continued from page 8._]      NICOLE & NIELSEN.    This exhibit, made specially for the Exhibition, comprised a full line  of plain levers, split seconds, chronographs, calendars, repeaters,  etc., and was a representative display of their peculiar style of  manufacture in all its details. The cost of these watches, compared  with others of similar construction and finish, was excessive; and  while they show good timekeeping qualities, they do not equal that of  other exhibits.    As representing their own methods of construction they are of the  first order of merit, and are adjudged a first-class award.      THOS. RUSSELL & SONS    exhibit a full line of their manufacture, which, upon comparison with  other exhibits of the same general character and construction, places  them in the third order of merit, and they are adjudged a third-class  award.      S. BACKSCHMID    exhibits a class of cheap watches of very inferior workmanship and  finish, of the last order of merit, and adjudged a fourth-class award.      N. CASTLEBERG & CO.    exhibit a meritorious line of watches in many respects, of good  finish, and not excessively high priced for their performances; of the  second order of merit, and adjudged a second class award.      A. LANGE & SONS    exhibit a class of watches possessing many elements of merit, and  of superior finish in many respects and at a cost which is quite  reasonable. That the watches are constructed upon scientific  principles and are intended as reliable timepieces, is shown from  Observatory tests. The variations show that care has been taken to  approximate a perfect adjustment, and that a partial success has  been attained. A peculiarity in the construction of the balance  wheel--having a horizontal split from the timing second holes each  way--is noticeable, which we fail to understand. This exhibit was made  expressly for this Exhibition, and Observatory rates sent with each  watch, and, as a representative exhibit, although small, was the  second best examined, and is, in its class, of the first order of  merit, and adjudged a first-class award.           *       *       *       *       *      LOUIS AUDEMARS    exhibits a wonderful class of complicated watches, calendars,  repeaters, chronographs, etc., etc., combined in one watch, and  elaborately cased and artistically finished. The great element of  merit in this exhibit is in the combination of the great number  of unusual functions for a watch, and by skill in workmanship and  mechanical science securing a correct performance.    The enormous cost of these watches is an effectual embargo on their  use to any except the very few, and their utility is, therefore,  very limited. In their class they are, however, of the first order of  merit, and adjudged a first-class award.      G. TRIBANDEAU    exhibits a considerable collection of watches in a great variety of  cases, of a class of workmanship, finish, and performance calling for  the fourth order of merit, and are adjudged a fourth-class award.      A. H. RODANET    exhibits two marine chronometers only, one of which was broken and the  other out of order; commended.

She is perfect, however, from head to foot; and she loses no time, but  hastens at once to other cells that have not yet opened, and there joins  in the dance and starts beating her wings with the others, so that she  may help in quickening the birth of her sisters who have not yet come to  life.    The most arduous labors, however, will at first be spared her. She will  not leave the hive till a week has passed since the day of her birth.  She will then undertake her first flight, known as the  \"cleansing-flight,\" and absorb the air into her lungs, which will fill  and expand her body; and thenceforward she becomes the mistress of  space. The first flight accomplished, she returns to the hive, and waits  yet one week more; and then, with her sisters, who were born the same  day as herself, she will for the first time sally forth and visit the  flowers. A special emotion, now, will lay hold of her; a kind of  shrinking, almost of fear. For it is evident that the bees are afraid;  that these daughters of the crowd, of secluded darkness, shrink from the  vault of blue, from the infinite loneliness of the light; and their joy  is halting, and woven of terror. They cross the threshold, and pause;  they depart, they return twenty times. They hover aloft in the air,  their heads turned towards their home; they describe great soaring  circles, their thirteen thousand eyes taking in, registering and  recording, the trees and the fountain, the gate and the walls, the  neighboring windows and houses, till at last the outside world becomes  familiar to them, and they know that they will be able to find their way  back to the hive.    It is curious how they are able to accomplish this; to return to a home  that they cannot see, that is hidden perhaps by the trees, and that in  any event must form so tiny a point in space. Put some of them into a  box and set them free at a place that is two or three miles from their  hive, they will almost invariably succeed in discovering their way home.  Have they landmarks by which they guide themselves, or do they possess  the instinct, the sense of direction, that is common among swallows and  pigeons? Different experiments that have been made appear to show that  this latter is not the case. I have, however, on more than one occasion  noticed that the bees seem to pay no attention to the color or shape of  the hive. It is rather the platform on which the hive rests that  attracts them, the position of the entrance-gate and of the  alighting-board. When the winter comes on, a hive may be taken away and  put perhaps into some dark cellar where it will remain till the spring;  if then it should be set a little to right or to left of its former  position on the platform, all the bees, on their first return from  visiting the flowers, will steer their straight, direct, unhesitating  course to the precise spot which the hive had occupied in the preceding  year; and it will only be after much hesitating and groping that they  will find the door whose place has now been shifted. And some will be  unable to do this, or will be altogether lost.      In the old hive thousands of cradles are stirring and the larvae coming  to life; such bustle and movement is there that the solid walls seem to  shake. But the city still lacks a queen. In the center of one of the  combs you may notice seven or eight curious structures, each one about  three or four times as large as the ordinary worker's cell; they look  something like the circles and hillocks that we see on the photographs  of the moon. These dwellings are surrounded by guards who never leave  them, and are always watchful and alert. They know that they are  protecting the home of the queen that is to be.    In these cells eggs will have been placed by the old queen, or more  probably perhaps by one of the workers, before the departure of the  swarm; the eggs will have been taken from some cell that was near, and  will be exactly the same as those from which the ordinary worker-bee is  hatched. And yet the bee that will in due time come out is so unlike the  others that she might almost belong to an entirely different race. Her  life will last four or five years, instead of the six or seven weeks  that are the portion of her worker-sister. Her body will be twice as  long, her color clearer, and more golden; her sting will be curved, and  her eyes have only seven or eight thousand facets instead of twelve or  thirteen thousand. Her brain will be smaller, and she will have no  brushes, no pockets in which to secrete the wax, no baskets to gather  the pollen. She will not crave for air, or the light of the sun; she  will die without once having sipped at a flower. She will spend her life  in the darkness, in the midst of an ever-moving crowd; and her one  thought, her one idea, will be the constant search for cradles in which  she can lay her eggs. It is probable that she will not, twice in her  life, look on the light of day; and as a rule she will only once make  use of her wings.      A week has passed, let us say, since the old queen has gone, at the head  of the swarm. The royal princesses who still are asleep in their cots  are not all of the same age; for the bees prefer that there should be an  interval between the birth of each one. The time of the eldest princess  draws near; she is already astir, and has begun eagerly to gnaw at the  rounded lid of her cradle, whose walls the workers have already for  several hours been thinning, so as to make it easier for her to get out.  And at last she thrusts her head through the lid; the workers at once  rush eagerly to her, and help her to get clear; they brush her, caress  her and clean her, and soon she is able to take her first trembling  steps on the comb. At first, her food will be the same as that given to  the ordinary workers, but after a very few days she is nourished on the  choicest and purest milk, which is known as \"royal jelly.\"    The princess, at the moment of birth, is weak and pale; but in a very  few minutes she gets her strength, and then a strange restlessness comes  over her; she seems to know that other princesses are near, that her  kingdom has yet to be won, that close by rivals are hiding; and she  eagerly paces the waxen walls in search of her enemies.    This is the gravest and most serious moment in the history of the hive.  The bees have to consider how many swarms they intend to send out; at  times they make mistakes, and leave the mother-city too empty, at times  also the swarms themselves are not sufficiently strong. These are  matters that the \"spirit of the hive\" has to settle; it has to decide  whether another queen will be required, in addition to the young one who  has just come to birth, in order that she may head a swarm in the  future. On this decision rests the whole prosperity of the hive; and  very rarely will the judgment of the bees go astray.      But let us assume that here the spirit of the hive has decided against a  second swarm. The young princess, who has just come to life, will be  allowed to destroy the rivals who are still asleep in their cradles. She  will hasten towards them, and the guard will respectfully make way. She  will fling herself furiously on to the first cell she comes across,  strip off the wax with teeth and claws, tear away the cocoon and dart  her sting into the victim whom she has laid bare. She will stab her to  death and then go, with the same passionate fury, to the next cell, and  then the next, again uncovering the cradle and killing her rival, till  at last, breathless and exhausted, she has destroyed all her sleeping  sisters.    The watchful circle of bees who surround her have stood by, inactive  and calm, and have not interfered; they have merely moved out of her way  and have let her indulge her fury; and no sooner has a cell been laid  waste than they rush to it, drag out the body, and greedily lap up the  precious royal jelly that clings to the sides of the cell. And if the  queen should be too weak or too tired to carry out her dreadful purpose  to the end, the bees will themselves complete this massacre of the  innocent princesses, and the royal race, and their dwellings, will all  disappear. This is the terrible hour of the hive.    At times it will happen that two queens will come to life together,  though this occurrence is rare, as the bees take special pains to  prevent it. But should such a case arise, the deadly combat would start  the very moment the rivals come out of their cradles. Afraid of each  other, and yet filled with fury, they attack and retreat, retreat and  attack, till at last one of them succeeds in taking her less adroit, or  less active, rival by surprise, and in killing her without risk to  herself. For the law of the race has demanded one sacrifice only.      But let us suppose that the spirit of the hive has decided that there  shall be a second swarm. In this case, as before, the queen will advance  threateningly towards the royal cells; but instead of finding herself  surrounded by obsequious servants, her way will be blocked by a guard of  stern and unflinching workers. In her mad fury, she will try to force  her way through, or to get round them; but in every direction sentinels  have been posted to protect the sleeping princesses. The queen will not  be denied; she returns again and again to the charge, puts forth every  effort; but each time she will be driven back, hustled even, till at  last it begins to dawn upon her that behind these little workers there  stands a law that does not yield even to a queen. And at last she goes,  and wanders unhappily from comb to comb, giving voice to her thwarted  fury in the war-song that every bee-keeper knows well; a note like that  of a far-away silver trumpet, and so clear that one may hear it, at  evening especially, two or"]]]
