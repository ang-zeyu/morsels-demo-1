TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES      Although _Syrrhophus marnocki_ and _Syrrhophus marnockii_ both appear  in this text, a literature search shows that both spellings have been  used and the two instances where there is only one \"i\" at the end are  in reference to priviously published names. Therefore, they were left  as is. With the exception of the list below and a number of silent  corrections, the text presented is that of the original printed version.

There seems to be the color of the European  imagination in this statement.    The giants lived on raw meat, thistles, and sweet root, and one of them  drank a \"bucket of water\" at a time.    The expedition remained at St. Julian five months, and acquired much  information about the country from the captive giants with whom they  learned to talk by sign language.    They here set up a cross on a mountain and took possession of the  country in the name of the King of Spain. They called the signal  elevation where they planted the cross the Mount of Christ.    The primitive people of the shores of Brazil and Patagonia delighted in  exciting the wonder of their visitors. Many of these people who thought  that the Europeans had come down from the sky, where they conceived all  life must be wonderful indeed, liked to show them some of the feats that  the people of the earth could do. The people who came down from the sky  they reasoned had great wisdom in sailing the seas, but they were not  giants. They could trail a lantern along the sea in the night air in  some unaccountable way, but they did not know how to run with flying  feet on the land or how to wing arrows with unerring aim into the sky  and sea.    One day there came from a company of the primitive people, a champion in  an art of which the Europeans could have never heard. They had seen  these people run, leap, and vault with almost magic power, but they had  never seen one who could make a tube of himself.    This new champion approached the men in the usual way, inviting  attention. He carried in his hand an arrow which was a cubit and a half  long.    He tilted it, opened his great mouth to receive it, dropped it into his  throat, when, amid muscular contortions, it began to descend. The  sailors watched him with amazement as it went down. It disappeared at  last, having, as we are told, descended to the \"bottom of his stomach.\"  It seemed to cause him no pain.    Presently the quiver began to appear again. The long arrow slowly rose  out of the human tube which the man had made of himself, and dropped  into his hand at last, the whole being performed by muscular movement.    He must have been delighted at the sensation which this mental control  over the muscles of digestion had produced. It was less strange that the  arrow should have gone down than that it should have come up again.    Such feats as these entertained the sailors from time to time when they  were on shore. Pigafetta was now seeing the \"wonders of the world\"  indeed.    Magellan's mind was given to the more serious problems of the voyage.    The Antarctic pole star now rose to his view. It was cold. Magellan saw  that the voyage would be likely to last long.    Not only the Portuguese came to distrust him, but some of the Spanish  sailors caught the infection of the deleterious atmosphere. They  reasoned differently from the Portuguese.    \"The Admiral is a native of Portugal,\" said they, \"and though the  Portuguese court rejected him, he will be sure in the end to be true to  his own people and King. He will never allow the glory of his  discoveries to go to Spain.\"    Some of them came to him to say that the wind blew cold, that the sea  was full of perils, that nothing but disaster could come by pushing on  into the sea where they were tending.    \"Turn south,\" said they.    The answer of Magellan was royal and loyal. We give it in what, from  what was reported of it, must be in his own thought, and very nearly his  own words.    \"Comrades, my course was laid down by Caesar (the King) himself.  I--will--not--depart--from--it--in--any--degree. I will open to Caesar an  unknown world.\"          CHAPTER XII.    THE MUTINY AT PORT JULIAN.--THE STRAITS.--1519.      Days of mutiny came in the cold waters.    The spirit of disloyalty that had found expression in the inspector  broke out anew at Port St. Julian. It spread through the officers and  crews of three of the ships. These caused to be published the resolution  that they would sail no farther.    \"You are leading us to destruction,\" said the mutineers.    Luis de Mendoza, Captain of the Victoria, the treasurer of the  expedition, was a leader of the mutiny. Another disturbing spirit was  Gasper de Queixada, Captain of the Concepcion.    Magellan, of the kind heart, had, as we have seen, the resolution to  meet emergencies. This expedition was his life. It must not be opposed,  hindered, or thwarted. He lived in his purpose. He must stamp out the  mutiny. He no more used gentle and courteous words. He thundered his  will.    One day Ambrosia Fernandez, his constable, came to him, and said:    \"Three crews are ready to mutiny, to force you to go back.\"    Magellan saw that he must make the leaders of these ships his prisoners,  or that he would become theirs.    \"Constable,\" he said, \"pick out sixty trusty men and arm them well. Go  with them on board the treasurer's ship, and arrest Mendoza and lay him  dead on the deck.\"    The fleet was moored in line. It was flood tide, and Mendoza's ship rode  astern of Magellan's, and the ship of Queixada, ahead.    Magellan prepared his own crew to face the consequences of a tragedy  should one occur. He ordered his hawser to be attached to the cable, and  called his crew to arms.    When the flood tide was at its height, Fernandez, the constable,  prepared to execute his order.    He appeared before the ship of the mutinous Mendoza, and asked to be  received on board.    \"Back to your own ship,\" said the mutineer. \"I command the Victoria.\"    \"But we are few against many,\" said the constable, \"and I have a message  from the Admiral which I must deliver.\"    He was helped on board the Victoria.    His feet had no sooner touched the deck than he seized Mendoza.    \"I arrest you in the name of the Emperor.\"    The armed men that the constable had left on the boat rushed on board.    The crew of the Victoria, stood aghast. They saw the power of the  Admiral's mind.    Magellan brought his ship alongside the Victoria.    He led his armed crew on board the Victoria, and halted before a  terrible scene. Mendoza had been stabbed by the constable, and the crew  of the Victoria plead for mercy, and promised to be loyal to the  Admiral.    In this hour of tragedy and terror Magellan bore his ship around to  Queixada's, and made the officers and crew of the Concepcion his  prisoners. The leaders of the mutiny were executed. It was a necessity.    Magellan caused also the sentence he had imposed on the inspector and  his accomplice to be carried out here.    Carthagena and Sanches were led from their prison to the shore.    As the sails were being lifted to depart, they were marooned--left with  some provisions, among which were some bottles of wine, on the desert  shore.    There were hearts that pitied them as the ships sailed away. There was  _one_ who plotted to rescue them. It was Gormez.    They left them some biscuits with the bottles of wine.    \"It is the last bread they will ever eat,\" said their companions.    \"And the last wine that they will ever drink,\" said a loyal priest on  board.    But there was one on board that shook his head.    If he could have his will the two would eat bread and drink wine again  in the convents of beautiful Seville.    The execution of the disloyal Spaniards again awakened the jealousy of  Gormez. He probably began to plan about this time to separate the  Antonio from the expedition, and lead her back to Spain. His heart was  with the inspector and friar far away on the desolate shore.    The ships sailed away, and the marooned priests saw them disappear.    \"They were cast aside for opposing a madman,\" reasoned Gormez. \"Magellan  is no fit leader of an expedition. If I had full command of the Antonio,  I would rescue the inspector, if I were to find him alive.\"    But he could not take the Antonio back while Mesquita, Magellan's loyal  cousin, was in command. Had he breathed a breath of disloyalty in the  presence of this Portuguese, he might have himself been deposed from his  position and marooned, as had been the inspector and the friar.    A dark plot began to form in the pilot's mind. If he could incite the  crew against Mesquita in some hour of peril, he might cause him to be  imprisoned on his own ship, and then he could succeed to the command,  and take the Antonio back to Spain.    And he would also endeavor to rescue the inspector and the friend of the  inspector who had been marooned. If he could rescue them and take them  back with him to Spain, they would be powerful witnesses for him against  Magellan.    Gormez now waited his opportunity. A jealous man seeks for a principle  of life to ease his conscience and justify evil deeds. Gormez had two  principles to sustain him in his disloyalty. The one was that he could  lead a better expedition, and the other the merciful rescue of his two  companions who had been marooned for the same opinions that he had from  the first carried in his heart. So calling treachery, loyalty and  sympathy, he awaited an hour favorable to his plan.    If he could return to Spain he would offer his services to Portugal or  to Spain to lead an expedition to the Spice Islands that should be  conducted in some more promising way than by the winter seas.    As the ships sailed on into the clouds and cold, the sailors were filled  with apprehension. But the farol still shone at night like a star in the  changing atmosphere. They had expected that the extremity of South  America would point West, but this was not the case. Whither were they  tending?    It"]]]
