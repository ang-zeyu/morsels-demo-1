The figure is of the male, and its natural size; the head dark brown with  pale spots; the back of a reddish tinge, and the rump and tail rufous; tail  much rounded, and of twelve feathers; the three outer and the two pair in  the middle entirely rufous, the other pair having the inner shafts black;  the greater quills black; the last having an internal bar of pale fulvous.  Beneath the eye a spot of white downy feathers, with a dusky border above  and below; there is a little difference between this and Illiger's bird,  but it may be only sexual.    Inhabits Brazil, but is rare.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 101    [Illustration]    PAPILIO Evander.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 92.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _Pap.

The crimson spots (which finely relieve the brownish  velvet-like black on the upper surface of the wings) are, in some lights,  most beautifully glossed with changeable violet, and appear either darker  or paler according to the position in which the insect is viewed.    Southern Brazil is, undoubtedly, more rich in this splendid family than the  northern provinces of that vast country. I never saw this species except in  Rio Janeiro, where it is common: nor do I know of any other, belonging to  the division of _Trojani_, which have the lower wings sharply dentated, and  with an appearance of obsolete _acute_ tails; a character more developed in  the female of this species than in the male.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 102    [Illustration]    PAPILIO Nox.           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 92.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P.

It was  discovered in Java by Dr. Horsfield; and the drawing was made from an  unique specimen which I observed while engaged in a long and laborious  arrangement of the Linnaean _Papilionidae_, (as they now appear at the  India House,) collected by that zealous naturalist for the India Company.    Between the nerves of the anterior wings (which are remarkably large) are  parallel central stripes, of a darker brown; a character common to many  Indian species, but not found, I believe, in any of those from the New  World.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 103    [Illustration]    AMPULLARIA fasciata,    _Banded Apple Snail._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Testa globosa, umbilicata.

It is only known that these shells, like the  Paludinae, are furnished with an operculum. The absence or presence of this  organ has been found of the first generic importance; though the substance  of which it is composed, as well as the form it assumes, can be considered  only as indicating specific distinctions. This is proved from the fact,  that among the Naticae some have horny, and some shelly, opercula: in  Phasianella, this part is, in some species, almost flat, in others  remarkably convex; in _Turbo, Lam._ its form is even more variable, and in  the present genus a similar uncertainty exists. One species alone has been  positively described as having this part shelly, while in two others the  operculum is as certainly known to be horny; to these last may be added a  third, found by myself in the lakes of Pernambuco in Brazil, but to which I  have not immediate access. The shells here figured were, however, received  from the same place by Mrs. Mawe, and, I think, are of the identical  species. The spire is sometimes worn, and the whole shell very thin.    Several fossil shells of this genus are mentioned as existing in the  extinct volcanoes of Ronca, in bituminous marl near Pont St. Esprit, &c. as  quoted (on the authority of the illustrious Cuvier) by Mr. Bowdich.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 104    [Illustration]    NATICA punctata,    _Spotted Natica._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 75.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _N. testa ovato-globosa, crassa, alba, strigis undatis punctisque      castaneis ornata; umbilico magno, aperto, simplici; columellae basi      obsoleta._        Shell ovate-globose, thick, white with waved stripes and minute chesnut      dots; umbilicus large, open, simple; base of the pillar obsolete.

Its most constant character rests on the umbilicus, which  is rather large, very deep, and without any appearance of the base of the  pillar. The mouth is also more contracted than usual. It is said by Adanson  to be common on the coast of Senegal; and this observing naturalist adds,  that the operculum is testaceous, of a pure white, and marked with numerous  concentric grooves at the upper angle.           *       *       *       *       *    NATICA effusa.           *       *       *       *       *        _N. testa depressa, alba, maculis castaneis ornata; spira brevissima;      columellae basi crassa, plana, ad labium interius sinu annexa._        Shell depressed, white, with chesnut spots; spire very small; umbilicus      large, open, spreading; base of the pillar thick, flat, and united to      the inner lip by a sinus.           *       *       *       *       *    In form, and sometimes in colour, this shell bears a close resemblance to  the oval variety of N. mamilla (_Nerita mamilla Lin._); but, the umbilicus,  instead of being entirely closed up, is remarkably open, very deep, and the  pillar forming an elevated ridge within; colour in the shells of this genus  is a very secondary, and, in many cases, a most fallacious guide for the  discrimination of the species; for this is sometimes pure white, and I have  specimens of _N. mamilla_ entirely orange. This is a rare shell, probably  from India.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 105    [Illustration]    TROCHILUS recurvirostris,    _Recurved-bill Humming Bird._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 82.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _T. aureo-viridis, jugulo smaragdino; pectore medio corporeque nigris;      rectricibus lateralibus subtus topazinis; rostro recurvo._        Golden green; throat shining emerald green; middle of the breast and      body black; lateral tail feathers beneath topazine; bill recurved.           *       *       *       *       *    The extraordinary formation in the bill of this beautiful little creature,  is without parallel in any land bird yet discovered, and presents in  miniature a striking resemblance to that of the Avoset.

GRIPE'S VIEWS OF INDIAN CHARACTER--THE DELAWARES' THE ISHMAELITES       OF THE PLAINS--THE TERRITORY OF THE \"LONG HORNS\"--TEXANS AND THEIR       CHARACTERISTICS--MUSHROOM ROCK--A VALUABLE DISCOVERY--FOOTPRINTS IN       THE ROCK--THE PRIMEVAL PAUL AND VIRGINIA.      We noticed many fine rivers rolling from the northward into the Kaw,  which stream we found was known by that name only after receiving the  Republican, at Junction City. Above that point, under the name of the  Smoky Hill, it stretches far out across the plains, and into the eastern  portion of Colorado. Along its desolate banks we afterward saw the sun  rise and set upon many a weary and many a gorgeous day.    All the large tributaries of the Kansas river, consisting of the Big  Blue, Republican, Solomon, and Saline, came in on our right. Upon our  left, toward the South, only small creeks joined waters with the Kaw,  the pitch of the great \"divides\" there being towards the Arkansas and  its feeders, the Cottonwood and Neosho.    We had now fairly entered on the great Smoky Hill trail. Here Fremont  marked out his path towards the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, and on  many of the high _buttes_ we discovered the pillars of stone which he  had set up as guides for emigrant trains, looking wonderfully like  sentinels standing guard over the valleys beneath. Indeed we did at  first take them for solitary herders, watching their cattle in some  choice pasture out of sight.    Most of our party had expected to find Indians in promiscuous abundance  over the entire State, and we were therefore surprised to see the  country, after passing St. Mary's Mission, entirely free of them. Muggs  asked Gripe if the American Indian was hostile to all nationalities  alike, or simply to those who robbed him of his hunting-grounds. The  orator replied as follows:    \"Sir, the aborigine of the western plains cares not what color or flavor  the fruit possesses which hangs from his roof tree. The cue of the  Chinaman is equally as acceptable as hairs from the mane of the English  lion. A red lock is as welcome as a black one, and disputes as to  ownership usually result in a dead-lock. His abhorrence is a wig, which  he considers a contrivance of the devil to cheat honest Indian industry.  I would advise geologists on the plains to carry, along with their picks  for breaking stones, a bottle of patent hair restorative. It is handy to  have in one's pocket when his scalp is far on its way towards some  Cheyenne war-pole. The scalping process, gentlemen, is the way in which  savages levy and collect their poll-tax. Any person in search of  romantic wigwams can have his wig warmed very thoroughly on the Arkansas  or Texas borders. On the plains along the western border of Kansas,  however, geologists can find a rich and comparatively safe field for  exploration. It is doubtful if the savages ever wander there again.    \"Of the Indian warrior on the plains we may well say, _requiescat in  pace_, and may his pace be rapid towards either civilization or the  happy hunting ground. History shows that his reaching the first has  generally given him quick transit to the second. The white man's country  has proved a spirit-land to Lo, whose noble soul seems to sink when the  scalping-knife gathers any other rust than that of blood, and whose  prophetic spirit takes flight at the prospect of exchanging boiled  puppies and dirt for the white brother's pork and beans. Very often,  however, it must be said, Lo's soul is gathered to his fathers by reason  of its tabernacle being smitten too sorely by corn lightning.\"    As Gripe paused, the Professor took up the subject in a somewhat  different strain:    \"We have here in this State,\" remarked he, \"a tribe which may well be  called the Indian Ishmael. Its hand is and ever has been, since history  took record of it, against its brethren, and its brethren's against it.  I refer to the pitiful remnant of the once great Delawares. From the  shores of the Atlantic they have steadily retreated before civilization,  marking their path westward by constant conflicts with other races of  red men. The nation in its eastern forests once numbered thousands of  warriors. Now, three hundred miserable survivors are hastening to  extinction by way of their Kansas reservation.    \"A number of their best warriors have been employed as scouts by the  government, when administering well merited chastisement to other  murdering bands. The Delawares, I have often thought, are like  blood-hounds on the track of the savages of the plains. They take fierce  delight in scanning the ground for trails and the lines of the streams  for camps. There is something strangely unnatural in the wild eyes of  these Ishmaelites, as they lead the destroyers against their race, and  assist in blotting it from the face of the continent. Themselves so  nearly joined to the nations known only in history, it is like a  plague-stricken man pressing eagerly forward to carry the curse, before  he dies, to the remainder of his people.\"    The valleys of the Saline, Solomon, and Smoky Hill, as we passed them in  rapid succession, seemed very rich and were already thickly dotted with  houses. This is one of the best cattle regions of the state, and vast  herds of the long-horned Texan breed covered the prairies. We were  informed that they often graze throughout the entire winter. As early in  the spring as the grass starts sufficiently along the trail from Texas  to Kansas, the stock dealers of the former State commence moving their  immense herds over it. The cattle are driven slowly forward, feeding as  they come, and reach the vicinity of the Kansas railroads when the grass  is in good condition for their summer fattening. As many as five hundred  thousand head of these long horns have been brought into the State in a  single season. Some are sold on arrival and others kept until fall, when  the choicest beeves are shipped East for packing purposes, or into  Illinois for corn feeding. The latter is the case when they are  destined eventually for consumption in Eastern markets, grass-fed beef  lacking the solid fatness of the corn-fed, and suffering more by long  transportation.    This very important trade in cattle, when fully developed, will probably  be about equally divided between southern and central Kansas, each of  which possesses its peculiar advantages for the business. While the  valley of the Arkansas has longer grass, and more of it, the dealers in  the Kaw region claim that their \"feed\" is the most nutritious. My own  opinion, carefully formed, is that both sections are about equally good,  and that the whole of western Kansas, with Colorado, will yet become the  greatest stock-raising region of the world. The climate is peculiarly  favorable. Two seasons out of three, on an average, cattle and sheep can  graze during the winter, without any other cover than that of the  ravines and the timber along the creeks.    The herders who manage these large bodies of cattle are a distinctive  and peculiar class. We saw numbers of them scurrying along over the  country on their wild, lean mustangs, in appearance a species of  centaur, half horse, half man, with immense rattling spurs, tanned skin,  and dare-devil, almost ferocious faces. After an extensive acquaintance  with the genus Texan, and with all due allowance for the better portion  of it, I must say, as my deliberate judgment, that it embraces a larger  number of murderers and desperadoes than can be found elsewhere in any  civilized nation. A majority of these herders would think no more of  snuffing out a life than of snuffing out a candle. Texas, in her rude  solitude, formerly stretched protecting arms to the evil doers from  other states, and to her these classes flocked. She offered them not a  city but a whole empire of refuge.    Just beyond Brookville, two hundred miles from the eastern border of  Kansas, our road commenced ascending the Harker Bluffs, a series of  sandstone ridges bordering on the plains.    On our left, Mushroom Rock was pointed out to us, a huge table of stone  poised on a solitary pillar, and strangely resembling the plant from  which it is named. As the professor informed us, we were on the eastern  shore of a once vast inland ocean, the bed of which now forms the  plains. Sachem thought the rock might be a petrified toad-stool, on a  scale with the gigantic toads which hopped around in the mud of that age  of monsters. The professor thought it was fashioned by the waters, in  their eddyings and washings.    Subsequent examinations showed this entire region to be one of  remarkable interest to the geologist. A few miles east of Mushroom Rock,  near Bavaria, as we learned from the conductor, human foot-prints had  been discovered in the sandstone. The professor, who had long ascribed  to man an earlier existence upon earth than that given him by geology,  was greatly excited, and at his earnest request, when the down train was  met, we returned upon it to Bavaria.

Two  sandstone blocks, each weighing several hundred pounds, lay in front of  one of the stores, and there, sure enough, impressed clearly and deeply  upon their surface were the tracks of human feet.
