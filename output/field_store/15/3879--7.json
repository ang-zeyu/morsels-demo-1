It was also to be prepared to establish,  on order, land-based air forces on Leyte. The Thirteenth Air Force  was to support the missions of the Fifth Air Force, while the Royal  Australian Air Force Command was to destroy Japanese installations  and sources of raw materials in the Netherlands Indies. [84]    Aircraft from other theaters agreed to aid in the operation. The  Fourteenth Air Force from the China-Burma-India Theater and the  Twentieth Air Force from the Central Pacific were to conduct strikes  against Formosa. The Southeast Asia Command was asked to schedule  air offensives against Burma and Malaya just prior to A Day. [85]        Naval Support    The Seventh Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid was assigned the following  mission: \"by a ship to shore amphibious operation, [to] transport,  protect, land and support elements of the 6th Army in order to assist  in the seizure, occupation and development of the Leyte area of the  Southern Philippines.\" [86] (Chart 2)    The Seventh Fleet was designated the Naval Attack Force. For the  operation Admiral Kinkaid organized two attack forces: the Northern  Attack Force (VII Amphibious Force), under Admiral Barbey, and  the Southern Attack Force (III Amphibious Force), under Admiral  Wilkinson. In addition, several subordinate units were created: a  bombardment and fire support group under Rear Adm. Jesse B. Oldendorf;  and a close covering group, an escort carrier group, a mine-sweeping  group, and twelve underwater demolition teams. The Northern Attack  Force was to transport and land the X Corps, while the Southern Attack  Force was to do the same for the XXIV Corps.    The task groups of the two attack forces were to sortie from the  mounting areas at Manus in the Admiralties and Hollandia in Netherlands  New Guinea and rendezvous en route to the objective area. Both were  \"to land main elements as nearly simultaneously as practicable at H  Hour on 20 October.\" Meanwhile, an advance group on 17 October was  to land the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion on the islands guarding the  approaches to Leyte Gulf. The task groups were to regulate their speed  of advance so that they would arrive at the entrance of the approach  channel to Leyte Gulf at specified times. The mine-sweeping group and  certain units of the bombardment and fire support group which were  to render fire support for initial mine-sweeping operations were to  arrive at 0600 on 17 October. They were to be followed fifteen minutes  later by the attack group assigned to the island approaches. At 1000  on the same day the rest of the bombardment and fire support group  were to arrive. Beginning at 2300 on 19 October the transports and  LST's of the two attack forces were scheduled to arrive in successive  groups. Their time of arrival was also set so that each group would  reach its transport area in sufficient time to dispatch the assault  waves to the beach at the designated hour. [87]    On arrival in the objective area, the bombardment and fire support  group was to divide into northern and southern fire support units,  which were then to move to their respective target areas. The northern  fire support unit consisted of 3 old battleships--the Mississippi,  Maryland, and West Virginia--and 3 destroyers. The southern fire  support unit was composed of 3 battleships--the Tennessee, California,  and Pennsylvania--13 destroyers, 3 light cruisers, 3 heavy cruisers,  and 1 small seaplane tender.    The destroyers in the two target areas were to furnish protection to  the mine sweepers and the underwater demolition teams. The latter were  to cover the northern and southern beaches before A Day and search  out and destroy any obstacles, either Japanese-made or natural, in  the waters surrounding the landing beach areas. The mine sweepers  were to start clearing Leyte Gulf of fixed or floating mines on 17  October, three days before the main assault. On the following days,  including 20 October, they were to make more intensive sweeps of the  channels and landing beach areas, with the vessels going as close to  shore as possible without endangering gear. [88]    Admiral Oldendorf was to direct the bombardment and fire support. The  bombardment was to start on 17 October in preparation for the  landings on the island approaches. The gunfire before 20 October  was for the purpose of rendering unserviceable both airfields and  Japanese aircraft on the ground, in addition to destroying guns and  emplacements, fuel storage and ammunition dumps, naval forces and  shipping, beach defenses and strong points, troops, torpedo launching  ramps, and torpedo barges. Close fire support was to be given to the  underwater demolition teams and destructive fire was to be delivered  against enemy forces attempting overwater movements. Finally, night  harassing fire was scheduled to prevent any night attempts of the  Japanese to reconstruct the fortifications and airfields.    On 20 October the naval gunfire support units were to cover the  approach of the transports to the unloading areas and to furnish  necessary counterbattery fire; thoroughly cover the landing beach  areas from the low-water line to approximately 400 yards inland;  and closely support the landings with rockets, 4.2-inch mortars, and  gunfire of all caliber from the ships. After the landings, the naval  gunfire units were to deliver fire on call and prevent the Japanese  from either reinforcing or evacuating the island. [89]    The Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed Admiral Nimitz to support  General MacArthur's operation against Leyte. Admiral Nimitz ordered  Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet to \"destroy enemy naval and air forces  in or threatening the Philippine Area.\" The Third Fleet was also to  protect the air and sea communications along the Central Philippines  axis. If an opportunity to destroy major portions of the Japanese  Fleet should arise or could be created, such destruction was to be the  primary task of all naval forces from the Central Pacific. Admiral  Halsey and General MacArthur were to arrange the necessary measures  for the co-ordination of their operations. [90]    In support of the Leyte operation the Third Fleet was to contain  or destroy the Japanese Fleet and to destroy enemy aircraft and  shipping in the Formosa, Luzon, Visayan, and Mindanao areas from 9  October through 17 October, and from A Day for as long as necessary  during the next thirty days, in order to \"maintain their continued  neutralization.\" From 18 October until such time as the escort carriers  could assume direct support, the Third Fleet was to destroy enemy  ground defenses and installations in Leyte and adjacent areas. Finally,  the Third Fleet was to provide direct support by fast carrier aircraft  for the landing and subsequent operations. [91]    Submarines from both the Southwest Pacific and Central Pacific were to  support the operations by maintaining an offensive reconnaissance over  the most probable Japanese route of advance, maintaining observation  and lifeguard services and furnishing weather reports and strategic  patrols. Submarines from the Central Pacific were to patrol in the  Formosa, Luzon, Tokyo Bay, and Sasebo areas, while those from the  Seventh Fleet patrolled in the area of Makassar Strait, the Celebes  Sea, and the Sulu Sea. Submarines from both areas were to maintain  a strong patrol in the Hainan--northern Luzon areas. [92]    The naval gunfire, the air support, and the artillery fire were to  be carefully co-ordinated. At every level from battalion to army  representatives from each support arm were to co-ordinate the use  of their support arms against targets in their respective zones  of action. Requests for support were to be screened as they passed  through the various echelons for approval. Commanders in the field  felt that the passage of requests through many channels was time  consuming and consequently sometimes nullified what might have been  an immediate advantage. However, requests for support were usually  acted upon within an hour.        The Ground Forces    The ground forces designated for the Leyte operation came from two  different theaters--the X Corps from the Southwest Pacific and the XXIV  Corps from the Central Pacific. The XXIV Corps, originally intended  for the Yap operation, had been substituted for the XIV Corps,  originally intended for Leyte. As the new assignment of the XXIV  Corps placed it under the operational control of General MacArthur,  it was necessary that agreements on the co-ordination of operations  be reached by the commanders in chief of the two areas. The XXIV  Corps, with its original shipping, had been turned over to General  MacArthur. During the combat phase at Leyte, General MacArthur was to  furnish the replacements required by the XXIV Corps, but subsequent  replacements were to be supplied by Admiral Nimitz. [93]    The initial assault for the island of Leyte was to begin in the dim  half dawn of 17 October, when elements of the 6th Ranger Infantry  Battalion were to land under the protection of naval gunfire and seize  the small islands that guarded the entrance to Leyte Gulf. (Map 3)  Harbor lights were to be placed on Homonhon Island and the northern  tip of Dinagat Island in order to guide the passage of the convoy into  the gulf. Since it was believed that there were valuable mine charts  on Suluan, that island was added to the objectives of the 6th Rangers.    General Krueger had wanted to use either the reinforced 158th Infantry  Regiment or the reinforced 112th Cavalry Regimental Combat Team  to secure the island approaches to Leyte Gulf and the Panaon Strait  area. The 21st Infantry, which was assigned the mission of securing the  Panaon Strait area, then could have remained with the 24th Division,  its parent unit, and the 6th Ranger Battalion could have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#11)"],[1,"in the heat of a house.  They are  the largest of any species, and exquisitely coloured, the shades  being strongest on the upper side of the wings.  They differ greatly  in size, most males having an average wing sweep of five inches,  and a female that emerged in my conservatory from a cocoon that  I wintered with particular care had a spread of seven inches,  the widest of which I have heard; six and three quarters is a  large female.  The moth, on appearing, seems all head and abdomen,  the wings hanging limp and wet from the shoulders.  It at once  creeps around until a place where it can hang with the wings  down is found, and soon there begins a sort of pumping motion of  the body.  I imagine this is to start circulation, to exercise  parts, and force blood into the wings.  They begin to expand, to  dry, to take on colour with amazing rapidity, and as soon as they  are full size and crisp, the moth commences raising and lowering  them slowly, as in flight.  If a male, he emerges near ten in the  forenoon, and flies at dusk in search of a mate.    As the females are very  heavy with eggs, they usually remain  where they are.  After mating they begin almost at once to  deposit their eggs, and do not take flight until they have  finished.  The eggs are round, having a flat top that becomes slightly  depressed as they dry.  They are of pearl colour, with a touch of  brown, changing to greyish as the tiny  caterpillars develop.  Their  outline can be traced through the shell on which they make their  first meal when they emerge.  Female Cecropas average about three  hundred and fifty eggs each, that they sometimes place singly, and  again string in rows, or in captivity pile in heaps.  In freedom  they deposit the eggs mostly on leaves, sometimes the under, sometimes  the upper, sides or dot them on bark, boards or walls.  The percentage  of loss of eggs and the young is large, for they  are nowhere numerous  enough to become a pest, as they  certainly would if three hundred  caterpillars survived to each female moth.  The young feed on  apple, willow, maple, box-elder, or wild cherry leaves; and grow  through a series of feeding periods and moults, during which they  rest for a few days, cast the skin and intestinal lining and then  feed for another period.    After the females have finished depositing their eggs, they cling  to branches, vines or walls a few days, fly aimlessly at night  and then pass out without ever having taken food.    Cecropia has several 'Cousins,'  Promethea, Angulifera, Gloveri,  and Cynthia, that vary slightly in marking and more in colour.  All  are smaller than Cecropia.  The male of Promethea is the darkest moth  of the Limberlost.  The male of Angulifera is a brownish grey, the  female reddish, with warm tan colours on her wing borders.  She is  very beautiful.  The markings on the wings of both are not half-moon  shaped, as Cecropia and Gloveri, but are oblong, and largest at the  point next the apex of the wing.    Gloveri could not be told from Cecropiain half-tone reproduction by  any save a scientist, so similar are the markings, but in colour  they are vastly  different, and more beautiful.  The only living  Gloveri I ever secured was almost done with life, and she was so  badly battered I could not think of making a picture of her.  The  wings are a lovely red wine colour, with warm tan borders, and the  crescents are white, with a line of tan and then of black.  The  abdomen is white striped with wine and black.    Cynthia has pale olive green shadings on both male and female.  These are imported moths brought here about 1861 in the hope that  they  would prove valuable in silk culture.  They occur mostly  where the ailanthus grows.    My heart goes out to Cecropia because it is such a noble,  birdlike, big fellow, and since it has decided to be rare with me  no longer, all that is necessary is to pick it up, either in  caterpillar, cocoon, or moth, at any season of the year, in almost  any location.  The Cecropia moth resembles the robin among birds;  not alone because he is grey with red markings, but also he haunts  the same localities.  The robin is the bird of the eaves, the back  door, the yard and orchard.  Cecropia is the moth.  My doorstep is  not the only one they grace; my friends have found them in like  places.  Cecropia cocoons are attached to fences, chicken-coops,  barns, houses, and all through the orchards of old country  places,  so that their emergence at bloom time adds to May and June one more  beauty, and frequently I speak of them as the Robin Moth.    In connexion with Cecropia there came to me the most delightful  experience of my life.  One perfect night during the middle of  May, all the world white with tree bloom, touched to radiance with  brilliant moonlight; intoxicating with countless blending perfumes,  I placed a female Cecropia on the screen of my sleeping-room door  and retired.  The lot on which the Cabin stands is sloping, so that,  although the front foundations are low, my door is at least five feet  above the ground, and opens on a circular porch, from which steps  lead down between two apple trees, at that time sheeted in bloom.  Past midnight I was awakened by soft touches on the screen, faint  pullings at the wire.  I went to the door and found the porch,  orchard, and night-sky alive with Cecropias holding high carnival.  I had not supposed there were so many in all this world.  From  every direction they came floating like birds down the moonbeams.  I carefully removed the female from the door to a window close  beside, and stepped on the porch.  No doubt I was permeated with  the odour of the moth.  As I advanced to the top step, that lay  even with the middle branches of the apple trees, the exquisite big  creatures came swarming around me.  I could feel them on my hair,  my shoulders, and see them settling on my gown and outstretched  hands.    Far as I could penetrate the night-sky more were coming.  They  settled on the bloom-laden branches, on the porch pillars, on me  indiscriminately.  I stepped inside the door with one on each hand  and five clinging to my gown.  This experience, I am sure, suggested  Mrs. Comstock's moth hunting in the Limberlost.  Then I went back  to the veranda and revelled with the moths until dawn drove them  to shelter.  One magnificent specimen, birdlike above all the others,  I followed across the orchard and yard to a grape arbour, where I  picked him from the under side of a leaf after he had settled for  the coming day.  Repeatedly I counted close to a hundred, and then  they would so confuse me by flight I could not be sure I was not  numbering the same one twice.  With eight males, some of them fine  large moths, one superb, from which to choose, my female mated with  an insistent, frowsy little scrub lacking two feet and having torn  and ragged wings.  I needed no surer proof that she had very dim  vision.        CHAPTER IV  The Yellow Emperor:  Eacles Imperialis      Several years ago, Mr. A. Eisen, a German, of Coldwater, Michigan,  who devotes his leisure to collecting moths, gave me as pinned  specimens a pair of Eacles Imperialis, and their full life history.  Any intimate friend of mine can testify that yellow is my favourite  colour, with shades of lavender running into purple, second choice.  When I found a yellow moth, liberally decorated with lavender, the  combination was irresistible.  Mr. Eisen said the mounted specimens  were faded; but the living moths were beautiful beyond description.  Naturally I coveted life.    I was very particular to secure the history of the caterpillars  and their favourite foods.  I learned from Mr. Eisen that they  were all of the same shape and habit, but some of them might be  green, with cream-coloured heads and feet, and black face lines,  the body covered sparsely with long hairs; or they might be brown,  with markings of darker brown and black with white hairs; but they  would be at least three inches long when full grown, and would have  a queer habit of rearing and drawing leaves to their mouths when feeding.  I was told I would find them in August, on leaves of spruce, pine,  cherry, birch, alder, sycamore, elm, or maple; that they pupated in  the ground; and the moths were common, especially around lights in city  parks, and at street crossings.    Coming from a drive one rare June evening, I found Mr. William  Pettis, a shooter of oil wells, whom I frequently met while at my  work, sitting on the veranda in an animated business discussion  with the Deacon.    \"I brought you a pair of big moths that I found this morning on  some bushes beside the road,\" said Mr. Pettis.  \"I went to give  Mr. Porter a peep to see if he thought you'd want them, and they  both got away.  He was quicker than I, and caught the larger one,  but mine sailed over the top of that tree.\"  He indicated an elm  not far away.    \"Did you know them?\"  I asked the Deacon.    \"No,\" he answered.  \"You have none of the kind.  They are big as  birds and a beautiful yellow.\"    \"Yellow!\"  No doubt I was unduly emphatic.  \"Yellow!  Didn't you  know better than to open a box with moths in it outdoors at night?\"    \"It was my fault,\" interposed Mr. Pettis.  \"He told me not to  open the box, but I had shown them a dozen times to-day and they  never moved.  I didn't think about night being their time to fly.  I am very sorry.\"    So was I.  Sorry enough to have cried, but I tried my best to  conceal it.  Anyway, it might be Io, and I had that.  On going  inside to examine the moth, I found a large female Eacles  Imperialis, with not a scale of down misplaced.  Even by gas light  I could see that the yellow of the living moth was a warm canary  colour, and the lavender of the mounted specimen closer heliotrope  on the living, for there were pinkish tints that had faded from the  pinned moth.    She was heavy with eggs, and made no attempt to fly, so I closed  the"]]]
