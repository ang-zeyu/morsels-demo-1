He might have safely taken the  whole blame upon himself, but he preferred that an absent man should  bear a share of it, and he therefore stated that Law, upon his own  authority, had issued 1200 millions of notes at different times, and  that he (the Regent) seeing that the thing had been irrevocably done,  had screened Law, by antedating the decrees of the council, which  authorised the augmentation. It would have been more to his credit if he  had told the whole truth while he was about it, and acknowledged that  it was mainly through his extravagance and impatience that Law had  been induced to overstep the bounds of safe speculation. It was also  ascertained that the national debt, on the 1st of January, 1721,  amounted to upwards of $100 millions of livres, or more than 124,000,000  pounds sterling, the interest upon which was 3,196,000 pounds. A  commission, or visa, was forthwith appointed to examine into all the  securities of the state creditors, who were to be divided into five  classes, the first four comprising those who had purchased their  securities with real effects, and the latter comprising those who could  give no proofs that the transactions they had entered into were real and  bona fide. The securities of the latter were ordered to be destroyed,  while those of the first four classes were subjected to a most rigid and  jealous scrutiny. The result of the labours of the visa was a report,  in which they counselled the reduction of the interest upon these  securities to fifty-six millions of livres. They justified this advice  by a statement of the various acts of peculation and extortion which  they had discovered, and an edict to that effect was accordingly  published and duly registered by the parliaments of the kingdom.    Another tribunal was afterwards established, under the title of the  Chambre de l'Arsenal, which took cognizance of all the malversations  committed in the financial departments of the government during the late  unhappy period. A Master of Requests, named Falhonet, together with  the Abbe Clement, and two clerks in their employ, had been concerned  in divers acts of peculation, to the amount of upwards of a million of  livres. The first two were sentenced to be beheaded, and the latter  to be hanged; but their punishment was afterwards commuted into  imprisonment for life in the Bastile. Numerous other acts of dishonesty  were discovered, and punished by fine and imprisonment.    D'Argenson shared with Law and the Regent the unpopularity which had  alighted upon all those concerned in the Mississippi madness. He was  dismissed from his post of Chancellor, to make room for D'Aguesseau; but  he retained the title of Keeper of the Seals, and was allowed to attend  the councils whenever he pleased. He thought it better, however, to  withdraw from Paris, and live for a time a life of seclusion at his  country-seat. But he was not formed for retirement, and becoming moody  and discontented, he aggravated a disease under which he had long  laboured, and died in less than a twelvemonth. The populace of of Paris  so detested him, that they carried their hatred even to his grave.  As his funeral procession passed to the church of St. Nicholas du  Chardonneret, the burying-place of his family, it was beset by a riotous  mob, and his two sons, who were following as chief-mourners, were  obliged to drive as fast as they were able down a by-street to escape  personal violence.    As regards Law, he for some time entertained a hope that he should be  recalled to France, to aid in establishing its credit upon a firmer  basis. The death of the Regent, in 1723, who expired suddenly, as he  was sitting by the fireside conversing with his mistress, the Duchess  de Phalaris, deprived him of that hope, and he was reduced to lead  his former life of gambling. He was more than once obliged to pawn  his diamond, the sole remnant of his vast wealth, but successful play  generally enabled him to redeem it. Being persecuted by his creditors at  Rome, he proceeded to Copenhagen, where he received permission from the  English ministry to reside in his native country, his pardon for the  murder of Mr. Wilson having been sent over to him in 1719. He was  brought over in the admiral's ship, a circumstance which gave occasion  for a short debate in the House of Lords. Earl Coningsby complained that  a man, who had renounced both his country and his religion, should  have been treated with such honour, and expressed his belief that his  presence in England, at a time when the people were so bewildered by the  nefarious practices of the South Sea directors, would be attended with  no little danger. He gave notice of a motion on the subject; but it  was allowed to drop, no other member of the House having the slightest  participation in his lordship's fears. Law remained for about four years  in England, and then proceeded to Venice, where he died in 1729, in  very embarrassed circumstances. The following epitaph was written at the  time:--         \"Ci git cet Ecossais celebre,       Ce calculateur sans egal,       Qui, par les regles de l'algebre,       A mis la France a l'Hopital.\"    His brother, William Law, who had been concerned with him in the  administration both of the Bank and the Louisiana Company, was  imprisoned in the Bastile for alleged malversation, but no guilt was  ever proved against him. He was liberated after fifteen months, and  became the founder of a family, which is still known in France under the  title of Marquises of Lauriston.    In the next chapter will be found an account of the madness which  infected the people of England at the same time, and under very similar  circumstances, but which, thanks to the energies and good sense of a  constitutional government, was attended with results far less disastrous  than those which were seen in France.          THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE         At length corruption, like a general flood,       Did deluge all, and avarice creeping on,       Spread, like a low-born mist, and hid the sun.       Statesmen and patriots plied alike the stocks,       Peeress and butler shared alike the box;       And judges jobbed, and bishops bit the town,       And mighty dukes packed cards for half-a-crown:       Britain was sunk in lucre's sordid charms.       --Pope.    The South Sea Company was originated by the celebrated Harley, Earl  of Oxford, in the year 1711, with the view of restoring public credit,  which had suffered by the dismissal of the Whig ministry, and of  providing for the discharge of the army and navy debentures, and other  parts of the floating debt, amounting to nearly ten millions sterling.  A company of merchants, at that time without a name, took this debt  upon themselves, and the government agreed to secure them, for a certain  period, the interest of six per cent. To provide for this interest,  amounting to 600,000 pounds per annum, the duties upon wines, vinegar,  India goods, wrought silks, tobacco, whale-fins, and some other  articles, were rendered permanent. The monopoly of the trade to the  South Seas was granted, and the company, being incorporated by Act of  Parliament, assumed the title by which it has ever since been known. The  minister took great credit to himself for his share in this transaction,  and the scheme was always called by his flatterers \"the Earl of Oxford's  masterpiece.\"    Even at this early period of its history, the most visionary ideas  were formed by the company and the public of the immense riches of the  eastern coast of South America. Everybody had heard of the gold  and silver mines of Peru and Mexico; every one believed them to be  inexhaustible, and that it was only necessary to send the manufactures  of England to the coast, to be repaid a hundredfold in gold and silver  ingots by the natives. A report, industriously spread, that Spain was  willing to concede four ports, on the coasts of Chili and Peru, for  the purposes of traffic, increased the general confidence; and for many  years the South Sea Company's stock was in high favour.    Philip V of Spain, however, never had any intention of admitting the  English to a free trade in the ports of Spanish America. Negotiations  were set on foot, but their only result was the assiento contract, or  the privilege of supplying the colonies with negroes for thirty years,  and of sending once a year a vessel, limited both as to tonnage and  value of cargo, to trade with Mexico, Peru, or Chili. The latter  permission was only granted upon the hard condition, that the King of  Spain should enjoy one-fourth of the profits, and a tax of five per  cent. on the remainder. This was a great disappointment to the Earl of  Oxford and his party, who were reminded much oftener than they found  agreeable of the         \"Parturiunt montes, nascitur ridiculus mus.\"    But the public confidence in the South Sea Company was not shaken. The  Earl of Oxford declared, that Spain would permit two ships, in addition  to the annual ship, to carry out merchandise during the first year;  and a list was published, in which all the ports and harbours of these  coasts were pompously set forth as open to the trade of Great Britain.  The first voyage of the annual ship was not made till the year 1717,  and in the following year the trade was suppressed by the rupture with  Spain.    The King's speech, at the opening of the session of 1717, made pointed  allusion to the state of public credit, and recommended that proper  measures should be taken to reduce the national debt. The two great  monetary corporations, the South Sea Company and the Bank of England,  made proposals to Parliament on the 20th of May ensuing. The South  Sea Company prayed that their capital stock of ten millions might be  increased to twelve, by subscription or otherwise, and offered to accept  five per cent. instead of six upon the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6382"],[0,"Bat Wing (#11)"],[1,"the landlady appeared. She treated me to a pathetic glance, but refilled  the empty glass.    My American acquaintance having returned to his seat and having added a  very little water to the whisky went on:    \"Now, sir,\" said he, \"my name is Colin Camber, formerly of Richmond,  Virginia, United States of America, but now of the Guest House, Surrey,  England, at your service.\"    Taking my cue from Mr. Camber's gloomy but lofty manner, I bowed  formally and mentioned my name.    \"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Knox,\" he assured me;  \"and now, sir, to answer your question. When you came in a few moments  ago you glanced at me. Your eyes did not open widely as is the case  when one recognizes, or thinks one recognizes, an acquaintance, they  narrowed. This indicated retrospection. For a moment they turned aside.  You were focussing a fugitive idea, a memory. You captured it. You  looked at me again, and your successive glances read as follows: The  hair worn uncommonly long, the mathematical brow, the eyes of a poet,  the slight moustache, small mouth, weak chin; the glass at his elbow.  The resemblance is complete. Knowing how complete it is myself, sir, I  ventured to test my theory, and it proved to be sound.\"    Now, as Mr. Colin Camber had thus spoken in the serious manner of a  slightly drunken man, I had formed the opinion that I stood in the  presence of a very singular character. Here was that seeming mesalliance  which not infrequently begets genius: a powerful and original mind  allied to a weak will. I wondered what Mr. Colin Camber's occupation  might be, and somewhat, too, I wondered why his name was unfamiliar to  me. For that the possessor of that brow and those eyes could fail to  make his mark in any profession which he might take up I was unwilling  to believe.    \"Your exposition has been very interesting, Mr. Camber,\" I said. \"You  are a singularly close observer, I perceive.\"    \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I have passed my life in observing the ways of my  fellowmen, a study which I have pursued in various parts of the world  without appreciable benefit to myself. I refer to financial benefit.\"    He contemplated me with a look which had grown suddenly pathetic.    \"I would not have you think, sir,\" he added, \"that I am an habitual  toper. I have latterly been much upset by--domestic worries, and--er--\"  He emptied his glass at a draught. \"Surely, Mr. Knox, you are going  to replenish? Whilst you are doing so, would you kindly request Mrs.  Wootton to extend the same favour to myself?\"    But at that moment Mrs. Wootton in person appeared behind the counter.  \"Time, please, gentlemen,\" she said; \"it is gone half-past two.\"    \"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Camber, rising. \"What is that? You decline to  serve me, Mrs. Wootton?\"    \"Why, not at all, Mr. Camber,\" answered the landlady, \"but I can serve  no one now; it's after time.\"    \"You decline to serve me,\" he muttered, his speech becoming slurred. \"Am  I, then, to be insulted?\"    I caught a glance of entreaty from the landlady. \"My dear sir,\" I said,  genially, \"we must bow to the law, I suppose. At least we are better off  here than in America.\"    \"Ah, that is true,\" agreed Mr. Camber, throwing his head back and  speaking the words as though they possessed some deep dramatic  significance. \"Yes, but such laws are an insult to every intelligent  man.\"    He sat down again rather heavily, and I stood looking from him to the  landlady, and wondering what I should do. The matter was decided for  me, however, in a way which I could never have foreseen. For, hearing  a light footfall upon the step which led up to the bar-parlour, I  turned--and there almost beside me stood a wrinkled little Chinaman!     He wore a blue suit and a tweed cap, he wore queer, thick-soled  slippers, and his face was like a smiling mask hewn out of very old  ivory. I could scarcely credit the evidence of my senses, since the  Lavender Arms was one of the last places in which I should have looked  for a native of China.    Mr. Colin Camber rose again, and fixing his melancholy eyes upon the  newcomer:    \"Ah Tsong,\" he said in a tone of cold anger, \"what are you doing here?\"    Quite unmoved the Chinaman replied:    \"Blingee you chit, sir, vellee soon go back.\"    \"What do you mean?\" demanded Mr. Camber. \"Answer me, Ah Tsong: who sent  you?\"    \"Lilly missee,\" crooned the Chinaman, smiling up into the other's face  with a sort of childish entreaty. \"Lilly missee.\"    \"Oh,\" said Mr. Camber in a changed voice. \"Oh.\"    He stood very upright for a moment, his gaze set upon the wrinkled  Chinese face. Then he looked at Mrs. Wootton and bowed, and looked at me  and bowed, very stiffly.    \"I must excuse myself, sir,\" he announced. \"My wife desires my presence  at home.\"    I returned his bow, and as he walked quite steadily toward the door,  followed by Ah Tsong, he paused, turned, and said: \"Mr. Knox, I should  esteem it a friendly action if you would spare me an hour of your  company before you leave Surrey. My visitors are few. Any one, any one,  will direct you to the Guest House. I am persuaded that we have much in  common. Good-day, sir.\"    He went down the steps, disappearing in company with the Chinaman,  and having watched them go, I turned to Mrs. Wootton, the landlady, in  silent astonishment.    She nodded her head and sighed.    \"The same every day and every evening for months past,\" she said. \"I am  afraid it's going to be the death of him.\"    \"Do you mean that Mr. Camber comes here every day and is always fetched  by the Chinaman?\"    \"Twice every day,\" corrected the landlady, \"and his poor wife sends here  regularly.\"    \"What a tragedy,\" I muttered, \"and such a brilliant man.\"    \"Ah,\" said she, busily removing jugs and glasses from the counter, \"it  does seem a terrible thing.\"    \"Has Mr. Camber lived for long in this neighbourhood?\" I ventured to  inquire.    \"It was about three years ago, sir, that he took the old Guest House at  Mid-Hatton. I remember the time well enough because of all the trouble  there was about him bringing a Chinaman down here.\"    \"I can imagine it must have created something of a sensation,\" I  murmured. \"Is the Guest House a large property?\"    \"Oh, no, sir, only ten rooms and a garden, and it had been vacant for a  long time. It belongs to what is called the Crayland Park Estate.\"    \"Mr. Camber, I take it, is a literary man?\"    \"So I believe, sir.\"    Mrs. Wootton, having cleared the counter, glanced up at the clock and  then at me with a cheery but significant smile.    \"I see that it is after time,\" I said, returning the smile, \"but the  queer people who seem to live hereabouts interest me very much.\"    \"I can't wonder at that, sir!\" said the landlady, laughing outright.  \"Chinamen and Spanish men and what-not. If some of the old gentry that  lived here before the war could see it, they wouldn't recognize the  place, of that I am sure.\"    \"Ah, well,\" said I, pausing at the step, \"I shall hope to see more of  Mr. Camber, and of yourself too, madam, for your ale is excellent.\"    \"Thank you, sir, I'm sure,\" said the landlady much gratified, \"but as  to Mr. Camber, I really doubt if he would know you if you met him again.  Not if he was sober, I mean.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Oh, it's a fact, believe me. Just in the last six months or so he has  started on the rampage like, but some of the people he has met in here  and asked to call upon him have done it, thinking he meant it.\"    \"And they have not been well received?\" said I, lingering.    \"They have had the door shut in their faces!\" declared Mrs. Wootton with  a certain indignation. \"He either does not remember what he says or does  when he is in drink, or he pretends he doesn't. Oh, dear, it's a funny  world. Well, good-day, sir.\"    \"Good-day,\" said I, and came out of the Lavender Arms full of sympathy  with the views of the \"old gentry,\" as outlined by Mrs. Wootton; for  certainly it would seem that this quiet spot in the Surrey Hills had  become a rallying ground for peculiar people.          CHAPTER VIII    THE CALL OF M'KOMBO        Of tea upon the veranda of Cray's Folly that afternoon I retain several  notable memories. I got into closer touch with my host and hostess,  without achieving anything like a proper understanding of either of  them, and I procured a new viewpoint of Miss Val Beverley. Her repose  was misleading. She deliberately subjugated her own vital personality to  that of Madame de Staemer, why, I knew not, unless she felt herself under  an obligation to do so. That her blue-gray eyes could be wistful was  true enough, they could also be gay; and once I detected in them a  look of sadness which dispelled the butterfly illusion belonging to her  dainty slenderness, to her mobile lips, to the vagabond curling hair of  russet brown.    Paul Harley's manner remained absent, but I who knew his moods so well  recognized that this abstraction was no longer real. It was a pose  which he often adopted when in reality he was keenly interested in  his surroundings. It baffled me, however, as effectively as it baffled  others, and whilst at one moment I decided that he was studying Colonel  Menendez, in the next I became convinced that Madame de Staemer was the  subject upon his mental dissecting table.    That he should find in Madame a fascinating problem did not surprise me.  She must have afforded tempting study for any psychologist. I could  not fathom the nature of the kinship existing between herself and the  Spanish colonel, for Madame de Staemer was French to her fingertips.  Her expressions, her gestures, her whole outlook on life proclaimed the  fashionable Parisienne.    She possessed a vigorous masculine intelligence and was the most  entertaining companion imaginable. She was daringly outspoken, and it  was hard to believe that her gaiety was forced. Yet, as the afternoon  wore on, I became more and more convinced that such was the case.   "]]]
