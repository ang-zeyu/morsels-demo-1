But of one thing, even in that moment of bleak regrets, he was  distinctly glad, and that was that all these things had taken  place three thousand miles away from Claire Fenwick. He had not  been appearing at his best, and he was glad that Claire had not  seen him.    As he sat and smoked the remains of his cigar, while renewing his  apologies and explanations to his partner and soothing the ruffled  Nutty with well-chosen condolences, he wondered idly what Claire  was doing at that moment.    Claire at that moment, having been an astonished eye-witness of  the whole performance, was resuming her seat at a table at the  other end of the room.          7      There were two reasons why Lord Dawlish was unaware of Claire  Fenwick's presence at Reigelheimer's Restaurant: Reigelheimer's is  situated in a basement below a ten-storey building, and in order  to prevent this edifice from falling into his patrons' soup the  proprietor had been obliged to shore up his ceiling with massive  pillars. One of these protruded itself between the table which  Nutty had secured for his supper-party and the table at which  Claire was sitting with her friend, Lady Wetherby, and her steamer  acquaintance, Mr Dudley Pickering. That was why Bill had not seen  Claire from where he sat; and the reason that he had not seen her  when he left his seat and began to dance was that he was not one  of your dancers who glance airily about them. When Bill danced he  danced.    He would have been stunned with amazement if he had known that  Claire was at Reigelheimer's that night. And yet it would have  been remarkable, seeing that she was the guest of Lady Wetherby,  if she had not been there. When you have travelled three thousand  miles to enjoy the hospitality of a friend who does near-Greek  dances at a popular restaurant, the least you can do is to go to  the restaurant and watch her step. Claire had arrived with Polly  Wetherby and Mr Dudley Pickering at about the time when Nutty, his  gloom melting rapidly, was instructing the waiter to open the  second bottle.    Of Claire's movements between the time when she secured her ticket  at the steamship offices at Southampton and the moment when she  entered Reigelheimer's Restaurant it is not necessary to give a  detailed record. She had had the usual experiences of the ocean  voyager. She had fed, read, and gone to bed. The only notable  event in her trip had been her intimacy with Mr Dudley Pickering.    Dudley Pickering was a middle-aged Middle Westerner, who by thrift  and industry had amassed a considerable fortune out of automobiles.  Everybody spoke well of Dudley Pickering. The papers spoke well of  him, Bradstreet spoke well of him, and he spoke well of himself. On  board the liner he had poured the saga of his life into Claire's  attentive ears, and there was a gentle sweetness in her manner which  encouraged Mr Pickering mightily, for he had fallen in love with  Claire on sight.    It would seem that a schoolgirl in these advanced days would know  what to do when she found that a man worth millions was in love  with her; yet there were factors in the situation which gave  Claire pause. Lord Dawlish, of course, was one of them. She had  not mentioned Lord Dawlish to Mr Pickering, and--doubtless lest  the sight of it might pain him--she had abstained from wearing her  engagement ring during the voyage. But she had not completely lost  sight of the fact that she was engaged to Bill. Another thing that  caused her to hesitate was the fact that Dudley Pickering, however  wealthy, was a most colossal bore. As far as Claire could  ascertain on their short acquaintance, he had but one subject of  conversation--automobiles.    To Claire an automobile was a shiny thing with padded seats, in  which you rode if you were lucky enough to know somebody who owned  one. She had no wish to go more deeply into the matter. Dudley  Pickering's attitude towards automobiles, on the other hand, more  nearly resembled that of a surgeon towards the human body. To him  a car was something to dissect, something with an interior both  interesting to explore and fascinating to talk about. Claire  listened with a radiant display of interest, but she had her  doubts as to whether any amount of money would make it worth while  to undergo this sort of thing for life. She was still in this  hesitant frame of mind when she entered Reigelheimer's Restaurant,  and it perturbed her that she could not come to some definite  decision on Mr Pickering, for those subtle signs which every woman  can recognize and interpret told her that the latter, having paved  the way by talking machinery for a week, was about to boil over  and speak of higher things.    At the very next opportunity, she was certain, he intended to  propose.    The presence of Lady Wetherby acted as a temporary check on the  development of the situation, but after they had been seated at  their table a short time the lights of the restaurant were  suddenly lowered, a coloured limelight became manifest near the  roof, and classical music made itself heard from the fiddles in  the orchestra.    You could tell it was classical, because the banjo players were  leaning back and chewing gum; and in New York restaurants only  death or a classical speciality can stop banjoists.    There was a spatter of applause, and Lady Wetherby rose.    'This,' she explained to Claire, 'is where I do my stunt. Watch  it. I invented the steps myself. Classical stuff. It's called the  Dream of Psyche.'    It was difficult for one who knew her as Claire did to associate  Polly Wetherby with anything classical. On the road, in England,  when they had been fellow-members of the Number Two company of  _The Heavenly Waltz_, Polly had been remarkable chiefly for a  fund of humorous anecdote and a gift, amounting almost to genius,  for doing battle with militant landladies. And renewing their  intimacy after a hiatus of a little less than a year Claire had  found her unchanged.    It was a truculent affair, this Dream of Psyche. It was not so much  dancing as shadow boxing. It began mildly enough to the accompaniment  of _pizzicato_ strains from the orchestra--Psyche in her training  quarters. _Rallentando_--Psyche punching the bag. _Diminuendo_--Psyche  using the medicine ball. _Presto_--Psyche doing road work. _Forte_--The  night of the fight. And then things began to move to a climax. With  the fiddles working themselves to the bone and the piano bounding  under its persecutor's blows, Lady Wetherby ducked, side-stepped,  rushed, and sprang, moving her arms in a manner that may have been  classical Greek, but to the untrained eye looked much more like the  last round of some open-air bout.    It was half-way through the exhibition, when you could smell the  sawdust and hear the seconds shouting advice under the ropes, that  Claire, who, never having seen anything in her life like this  extraordinary performance, had been staring spellbound, awoke to  the realization that Dudley Pickering was proposing to her. It  required a woman's intuition to divine this fact, for Mr Pickering  was not coherent. He did not go straight to the point. He rambled.  But Claire understood, and it came to her that this thing had  taken her before she was ready. In a brief while she would have to  give an answer of some sort, and she had not clearly decided what  answer she meant to give.    Then, while he was still skirting his subject, before he had  wandered to what he really wished to say, the music stopped, the  applause broke out again, and Lady Wetherby returned to the table  like a pugilist seeking his corner at the end of a round. Her face  was flushed and she was breathing hard.    'They pay me money for that!' she observed, genially. 'Can you  beat it?'    The spell was broken. Mr Pickering sank back in his chair in a  punctured manner. And Claire, making monosyllabic replies to her  friend's remarks, was able to bend her mind to the task of finding  out how she stood on this important Pickering issue. That he would  return to the attack as soon as possible she knew; and the next  time she must have her attitude clearly defined one way or the  other.    Lady Wetherby, having got the Dance of Psyche out of her system,  and replaced it with a glass of iced coffee, was inclined for  conversation.    'Algie called me up on the phone this evening, Claire.'    'Yes?'    Claire was examining Mr Pickering with furtive side glances. He  was not handsome, nor, on the other hand, was he repulsive.  'Undistinguished' was the adjective that would have described him.  He was inclined to stoutness, but not unpardonably so; his hair  was thin, but he was not aggressively bald; his face was dull, but  certainly not stupid. There was nothing in his outer man which his  millions would not offset. As regarded his other qualities, his  conversation was certainly not exhilarating. But that also was  not, under certain conditions, an unforgivable thing. No, looking  at the matter all round and weighing it with care, the real  obstacle, Claire decided, was not any quality or lack of qualities  in Dudley Pickering--it was Lord Dawlish and the simple fact that  it would be extremely difficult, if she discarded him in favour of a  richer man without any ostensible cause, to retain her self-respect.    'I think he's weakening.'    'Yes?'    Yes, that was the crux of the matter. She wanted to retain her  good opinion of herself. And in order to achieve that end it was  essential that she find some excuse, however trivial, for breaking  off the engagement.    'Yes?'    A waiter approached the table.    'Mr Pickering!'    The thwarted lover came to life with a start.    'Eh?'    'A gentleman wishes to speak to you on the telephone.'    'Oh, yes. I was expecting a long-distance call, Lady Wetherby, and  left word I would be here. Will you excuse me?'    Lady Wetherby"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6687"],[0,"From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (#11)"],[1,"Cape Comorin to the river Surat, are there heights  of 7,000 feet above the surface of the sea. So that no comparison can  be dawn between these and the hoary headed patriarch Elbruz, or Kasbek,  which exceeds 18,000 feet. The chief and original charm of Indian  mountains wonderfully consists in their capricious shapes. Sometimes  these mountains, or, rather, separate volcanic peaks standing in a row,  form chains; but it is more common to find them scattered, to the great  perplexity of geologists, without visible cause, in places where the  formation seems quite unsuitable. Spacious valleys, surrounded by high  walls of rock, over the very ridge of which passes the railway, are  common. Look below, and it will seem to you that you are gazing upon  the studio of some whimsical Titanic sculptor, filled with half finished  groups, statues, and monuments. Here is a dream-land bird, seated upon  the head of a monster six hundred feet high, spreading its wings  and widely gaping its dragon's mouth; by its side the bust of a man,  surmounted by a helmet, battlemented like the walls of a feudal castle;  there, again, new monsters devouring each other, statues with broken  limbs, disorderly heaps of huge balls, lonely fortresses with loopholes,  ruined towers and bridges. All this scattered and intermixed with  shapes changing incessantly like the dreams of delirium. And the chief  attraction is that nothing here is the result of art, everything is the  pure sport of Nature, which, however, has occasionally been turned to  account by ancient builders. The art of man in India is to be sought  in the interior of the earth, not on its surface. Ancient Hindus seldom  built their temples otherwise than in the bosom of the earth, as  though they were ashamed of their efforts, or did not dare to rival the  sculpture of nature. Having chosen, for instance, a pyramidal rock, or  a cupola shaped hillock like Elephanta, Or Karli, they scraped away  inside, according to the Puranas, for centuries, planning on so grand a  style that no modern architecture has been able to conceive anything  to equal it. Fables (?) about the Cyclops seem truer in India than in  Egypt.    The marvellous railroad from Narel to Khandala reminds one of a similar  line from Genoa up the Apenines. One may be said to travel in the air,  not on land. The railway traverses a region 1,400 feet above Konkan,  and, in some places, while one rail is laid on the sharp edge of the  rock, the other is supported on vaults and arches. The Mali Khindi  viaduct is 163 feet high. For two hours we hastened on between sky and  earth, with abysses on both sides thickly covered with mango trees and  bananas. Truly English engineers are wonderful builders.    The pass of Bhor-Ghat is safely accomplished and we are in Khandala.  Our bungalow here is built on the very edge of a ravine, which nature  herself has carefully concealed under a cover of the most luxuriant  vegetation. Everything is in blossom, and, in this unfathomed recess,  a botanist might find sufficient material to occupy him for a lifetime.  Palms have disappeared; for the most part they grow only near the  sea. Here they are replaced by bananas, mango trees, pipals (ficus  religiosa), fig trees, and thousands of other trees and shrubs, unknown  to such outsiders as ourselves. The Indian flora is too often slandered  and misrepresented as being full of beautiful, but scentless, flowers.  At some seasons this may be true enough, but, as long as jasmines,  the various balsams, white tuberoses, and golden champa (champaka or  frangipani) are in blossom, this statement is far from being true. The  aroma of champa alone is so powerful as to make one almost giddy. For  size, it is the king of flowering trees, and hundreds of them were in  full bloom, just at this time of year, on Mataran and Khandala.    We sat on the verandah, talking and enjoying the surrounding views,  until well-nigh midnight. Everything slept around us.    Khandala is nothing but a big village, situated on the flat top of one  of the mountains of the Sahiadra range, about 2,200 feet above the sea  level. It is surrounded by isolated peaks, as strange in shape as any we  have seen.    One of them, straight before us, on the opposite side of the abyss,  looked exactly like a long, one-storied building, with a flat roof and  a battlemented parapet. The Hindus assert that, somewhere about this  hillock, there exists a secret entrance, leading into vast interior  halls, in fact to a whole subterranean palace, and that there still  exist people who possess the secret of this abode. A holy hermit, Yogi,  and Magus, who had inhabited these caves for \"many centuries,\" imparted  this secret to Sivaji, the celebrated leader of the Mahratta armies.  Like Tanhauser, in Wagner's opera, the unconquerable Sivaji spent seven  years of his youth in this mysterious abode, and therein acquired his  extraordinary strength and valour.    Sivaji is a kind of Indian Ilia Moorometz, though his epoch is much  nearer to our times. He was the hero and the king of the Mahrattas in  the seventeenth century, and the founder of their short-lived empire. It  is to him that India owes the weakening, if not the entire destruction,  of the Mussulman yoke. No taller than an ordinary woman, and with the  hand of a child, he was, nevertheless, possessed of wonderful strength,  which, of course, his compatriots ascribed to sorcery. His sword is  still preserved in a museum, and one cannot help wondering at its size  and weight, and at the hilt, through which only a ten-year-old child  could put his hand. The basis of this hero's fame is the fact that  he, the son of a poor officer in the service of a Mogul emperor, like  another David, slew the Mussulman Goliath, the formidable Afzul Khan.  It was not, however, with a sling that he killed him, he used in this  combat the formidable Mahratti weapon, vaghnakh, consisting of five long  steel nails, as sharp as needles, and very strong. This weapon is worn  on the fingers, and wrestlers use it to tear each other's flesh like  wild animals. The Deccan is full of legends about Sivaji, and even  the English historians mention him with respect. Just as in the fable  respecting Charles V, one of the local Indian traditions asserts that  Sivaji is not dead, but lives secreted in one of the Sahiadra caves.  When the fateful hour strikes (and according to the calculations of the  astrologers the time is not far off) he will reappear, and will bring  freedom to his beloved country.    The learned and artful Brahmans, those Jesuits of India, profit by  the profound superstition of the masses to extort wealth from them,  sometimes to the last cow, the only food giver of a large family.    In the following passage I give a curious example of this. At the end  of July, 1879, this mysterious document appeared in Bombay. I translate  literally, from the Mahratti, the original having been translated into  all the dialects of India, of which there are 273.    \"Shri!\" (an untranslatable greeting). \"Let it be known unto every one  that this epistle, traced in the original in golden letters, came down  from Indra-loka (the heaven of Indra), in the presence of holy Brahmans,  on the altar of the Vishveshvara temple, which is in the sacred town of  Benares.    \"Listen and remember, O tribes of Hindustan, Rajis-tan, Punjab, etc.,  etc. On Saturday, the second day of the first half of the month Magha,  1809, of Shalivahan's era\" (1887 A.D.), \"the eleventh month of the  Hindus, during the Ashwini Nakshatra\" (the first of the twenty-seven  constellations on the moon's path), \"when the sun enters the sign  Capricorn, and the time of the day will be near the constellation  Pisces, that is to say, exactly one hour and thirty-six minutes after  sunrise, the hour of the end of the Kali-Yug will strike, and the  much desired Satya-Yug will commence\" (that is to say, the end of the  Maha-Yug, the great cycle that embraces the four minor Yugas). \"This  time Satya-Yug will last 1,100 years. During all this time a man's  lifetime will be 128 years. The days will become longer and will consist  of twenty hours and forty-eight minutes, and the nights of thirteen  hours and twelve minutes, that is to say, instead of twenty-four hours  we shall have exactly thirty-four hours and one minute. The first day  of Satya-Yug will be very important for us, because it is then that will  appear to us our new King with white face and golden hair, who will come  from the far North. He will become the autonomous Lord of India. The  Maya of human unbelief, with all the heresies over which it presides,  will be thrown down to Patala\" (sig-nifying at once hell and the  antipodes), \"and the Maya of the righteous and pious will abide with  them, and will help them to enjoy life in Mretinloka\" (our earth).    \"Let it also be known to everyone that, for the dissemination of this  divine document, every separate copy of it will be rewarded by the  forgiveness of as many sins as are generally forgiven when a pious man  sacrifices to a Brahman one hundred cows. As for the disbelievers and  the indifferent, they will be sent to Naraka\" (hell). \"Copied out and  given, by the slave of Vishnu, Malau Shriram, on Saturday, the 7th  day of the first half of Shravan\" (the fifth month of the Hindu year),  \"1801, of Shalivalian's era\" (that is, 26th July, 1879).    The further career of this ignorant and cunning epistle is not known  to me. Probably the police put a stop to its distribution; this only  concerns the wise administrators. But it splendidly illustrates, from  one side, the credulity of the populace, drowned in superstition, and  from the other the unscrupulousness of the Brahmans.    Concerning the word Patala, which literally means the opposite side,  a recent discovery of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, whom I have already  mentioned in the preceding letters, is interesting, especially if this  "]]]
