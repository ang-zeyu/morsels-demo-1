The Gods themselves often permit safety to come from  what is evil, but shall we therefore call evil good--or say the hideous  is beautiful? Make use of the king's pioneer as you will, but do  not, because you are indebted to him for gifts, neglect to judge him  according to his imaginings and deeds if you would deserve your title  of the Initiated and the Enlightened. Let him bring his cattle into our  temple and pour his gold into our treasury, but do not defile your souls  with the thought that the offerings of such a heart and such a hand are  pleasing to the Divinity. Above all,\" and the voice of the old man had  a heart-felt impressiveness, \"Above all, do not flatter the erring  man--and this is what you do, with the idea that he is walking in  the right way; for your, for our first duty, O my friends, is always  this--to guide the souls of those who trust in us to goodness and  truth.\"    \"Oh, my master!\" cried Pentaur, \"how tender is thy severity.\"    \"I have shown the hideous sores of this man's soul,\" said the old man,  as he rose to quit the hall. \"Your praise will aggravate them, your  blame will tend to heal them. Nay, if you are not content to do your  duty, old Gagabu will come some day with his knife, and will throw the  sick man down and cut out the canker.\"    During this speech the haruspex had frequently shrugged his shoulders.  Now he said, turning to the priests from Chennu--    \"Gagabu is a foolish, hot-headed old man, and you have heard from his  lips just such a sermon as the young scribes keep by them when they  enter on the duties of the care of souls. His sentiments are excellent,  but he easily overlooks small things for the sake of great ones. Ameni  would tell you that ten souls, no, nor a hundred, do not matter when the  safety of the whole is in question.\"          CHAPTER V.    The night during which the Princess Bent-Anat and her followers had  knocked at the gate of the House of Seti was past.    The fruitful freshness of the dawn gave way to the heat, which began to  pour down from the deep blue cloudless vault of heaven. The eye could  no longer gaze at the mighty globe of light whose rays pierced the fine  white dust which hung over the declivity of the hills that enclosed the  city of the dead on the west. The limestone rocks showed with blinding  clearness, the atmosphere quivered as if heated over a flame; each  minute the shadows grew shorter and their outlines sharper.    All the beasts which we saw peopling the Necropolis in the evening had  now withdrawn into their lurking places; only man defied the heat of the  summer day. Undisturbed he accomplished his daily work, and only laid  his tools aside for a moment, with a sigh, when a cooling breath blew  across the overflowing stream and fanned his brow.    The harbor or clock where those landed who crossed from eastern Thebes  was crowded with barks and boats waiting to return.    The crews of rowers and steersmen who were attached to priestly  brotherhoods or noble houses, were enjoying a rest till the parties they  had brought across the Nile drew towards them again in long processions.    Under a wide-spreading sycamore a vendor of eatables, spirituous drinks,  and acids for cooling the water, had set up his stall, and close to him,  a crowd of boatmen, and drivers shouted and disputed as they passed the  time in eager games at morra.       [In Latin \"micare digitis.\" A game still constantly played in the     south of Europe, and frequently represented by the Egyptians. The     games depicted in the monuments are collected by Minutoli, in the     Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung, 1852.]    Many sailors lay on the decks of the vessels, others on the shore; here  in the thin shade of a palm tree, there in the full blaze of the sun,  from those burning rays they protected themselves by spreading the  cotton cloths, which served them for cloaks, over their faces.    Between the sleepers passed bondmen and slaves, brown and black, in long  files one behind the other, bending under the weight of heavy burdens,  which had to be conveyed to their destination at the temples for  sacrifice, or to the dealers in various wares. Builders dragged blocks  of stone, which had come from the quarries of Chennu and Suan,       [The Syene of the Greeks, non, called Assouan at the first     cataract.]    on sledges to the site of a new temple; laborers poured water under the  runners, that the heavily loaded and dried wood should not take fire.    All these working men were driven with sticks by their overseers, and  sang at their labor; but the voices of the leaders sounded muffled and  hoarse, though, when after their frugal meal they enjoyed an hour of  repose, they might be heard loud enough. Their parched throats refused  to sing in the noontide of their labor.    Thick clouds of gnats followed these tormented gangs, who with dull and  spirit-broken endurance suffered alike the stings of the insects and the  blows of their driver. The gnats pursued them to the very heart of the  City of the dead, where they joined themselves to the flies and wasps,  which swarmed in countless crowds around the slaughter houses, cooks'  shops, stalls of fried fish, and booths of meat, vegetable, honey, cakes  and drinks, which were doing a brisk business in spite of the noontide  heat and the oppressive atmosphere heated and filled with a mixture of  odors.    The nearer one got to the Libyan frontier, the quieter it became, and  the silence of death reigned in the broad north-west valley, where in  the southern slope the father of the reigning king had caused his tomb  to be hewn, and where the stone-mason of the Pharaoh had prepared a rock  tomb for him.    A newly made road led into this rocky gorge, whose steep yellow and  brown walls seemed scorched by the sun in many blackened spots, and  looked like a ghostly array of shades that had risen from the tombs in  the night and remained there.    At the entrance of this valley some blocks of stone formed a sort of  doorway, and through this, indifferent to the heat of day, a small but  brilliant troop of the men was passing.    Four slender youths as staff bearers led the procession, each clothed  only with an apron and a flowing head-cloth of gold brocade; the mid-day  sun played on their smooth, moist, red-brown skins, and their supple  naked feet hardly stirred the stones on the road.    Behind them followed an elegant, two-wheeled chariot, with two prancing  brown horses bearing tufts of red and blue feathers on their noble  heads, and seeming by the bearing of their arched necks and flowing  tails to express their pride in the gorgeous housings, richly  embroidered in silver, purple, and blue and golden ornaments, which they  wore--and even more in their beautiful, royal charioteer, Bent-Anat, the  daughter of Rameses, at whose lightest word they pricked their ears, and  whose little hand guided them with a scarcely perceptible touch.    Two young men dressed like the other runners followed the chariot, and  kept the rays of the sun off the face of their mistress with large fans  of snow-white ostrich feathers fastened to long wands.    By the side of Bent-Anat, so long as the road was wide enough to allow  of it, was carried Nefert, the wife of Mena, in her gilt litter, borne  by eight tawny bearers, who, running with a swift and equally measured  step, did not remain far behind the trotting horses of the princess and  her fan-bearers.    Both the women, whom we now see for the first time in daylight, were of  remarkable but altogether different beauty.    The wife of Mena had preserved the appearance of a maiden; her large  almond-shaped eyes had a dreamy surprised look out from under her long  eyelashes, and her figure of hardly the middle-height had acquired a  little stoutness without losing its youthful grace. No drop of foreign  blood flowed in her veins, as could be seen in the color of her skin,  which was of that fresh and equal line which holds a medium between  golden yellow and bronze brown--and which to this day is so charming in  the maidens of Abyssinia--in her straight nose, her well-formed brow,  in her smooth but thick black hair, and in the fineness of her hands and  feet, which were ornamented with circles of gold.    The maiden princess next to her had hardly reached her nineteenth year,  and yet something of a womanly self-consciousness betrayed itself in  her demeanor. Her stature was by almost a head taller than that of  her friend, her skin was fairer, her blue eyes kind and frank, without  tricks of glance, but clear and honest, her profile was noble but  sharply cut, and resembled that of her father, as a landscape in the  mild and softening light of the moon resembles the same landscape in the  broad clear light of day. The scarcely perceptible aquiline of her nose,  she inherited from her Semitic ancestors,       [Many portraits have come down to us of Rameses: the finest is the     noble statue preserved at Turin. A likeness has been detected     between its profile, with its slightly aquiline nose, and that of     Napoleon I.]    as well as the slightly waving abundance of her brown hair, over which  she wore a blue and white striped silk kerchief; its carefully-pleated  folds were held in place by a gold ring, from which in front a horned  urarus       [A venomous Egyptian serpent which was adopted as the symbol of     sovereign power, in consequence of its swift effects for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],[0,"An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#11)"],[1,"  tottering. The weight of the metal would have crushed a bull to the  earth: but borne by Milo it seemed like a child in the arms of its  Lacedaemonian nurse.    \"The highest honors (after Cimon's) were adjudged to a pair of Spartan  brothers, Lysander and Maro, the sons of Aristomachus. Maro was victor  in the foot race, but Lysander presented himself, amidst the shouts of  the spectators, as the opponent of Milo! Milo the invincible, victor  at Pisa, and in the Pythian and Isthmian combats. Milo was taller and  stouter than the Spartan, who was formed like Apollo, and seemed from  his great youth scarcely to have passed from under the hands of the  schoolmaster.    \"In their naked beauty, glistening with the golden oil, the youth  and the man stood opposite to one another, like a panther and a lion  preparing for the combat. Before the onset, the young Lysander raised  his hands imploringly to the gods, crying: 'For my father, my honor,  and the glory of Sparta!' The Crotonian looked down on the youth with  a smile of superiority; just as an epicure looks at the shell of the  languste he is preparing to open.    \"And now the wrestling began. For some time neither could succeed in  grasping the other. The Crotonian threw almost irresistible weight into  his attempts to lay hold of his opponent, but the latter slipped through  the iron grip like a snake. This struggle to gain a hold lasted long,  and the immense multitude watched silently, breathless from excitement.  Not a sound was to be heard but the groans of the wrestlers and the  singing of the nightingales in the grove of the Altis. At last, the  youth succeeded, by means of the cleverest trick I ever saw, in clasping  his opponent firmly. For a long time, Milo exerted all his strength  to shake him oft, but in vain, and the sand of the Stadium was freely  moistened by the great drops of sweat, the result of this Herculean  struggle.    \"More and more intense waxed the excitement of the spectators, deeper  and deeper the silence, rarer the cries of encouragement, and louder  the groans of the wrestlers. At last Lysander's strength gave way.  Immediately a thousand voices burst forth to cheer him on. He roused  himself and made one last superhuman effort to throw his adversary:  but it was too late. Milo had perceived the momentary weakness. Taking  advantage of it, he clasped the youth in a deadly embrace; a full black  stream of blood welled from Lysander's beautiful lips, and he sank  lifeless to the earth from the wearied arms of the giant. Democedes, the  most celebrated physician of our day, whom you Samians will have known  at the court of Polycrates, hastened to the spot, but no skill could now  avail the happy Lysander,--he was dead.    \"Milo was obliged to forego the victor's wreath\"; and the fame of this  youth will long continue to sound through the whole of Greece.       [By the laws of the games the wrestler, whose adversary died, had no     right to the prize of victory.]    I myself would rather be the dead Lysander, son of Aristomachus, than  the living Kallias growing old in inaction away from his country.  Greece, represented by her best and bravest, carried the youth to his  grave, and his statue is to be placed in the Altis by those of Milo of  Crotona and Praxidamas of AEgina\". At length the heralds proclaimed the  sentence of the judges: 'To Sparta be awarded a victor's wreath for the  dead, for the noble Lysander hath been vanquished, not by Milo, but by  Death, and he who could go forth unconquered from a two hours' struggle  with the strongest of all Greeks, hath well deserved the olive-branch.'\"    Here Kallias stopped a moment in his narrative. During his animated  description of these events, so precious to every Greek heart, he had  forgotten his listeners, and, gazing into vacancy, had seen only the  figures of the wrestlers as they rose before his remembrance. Now, on  looking round, he perceived, to his astonishment, that the grey-haired  man with the wooden leg, whom he had already noticed, though without  recognizing him, had hidden his face in his hands and was weeping.  Rhodopis was standing at his right hand. Phanes at his left, and the  other guests were gazing at the Spartan, as if he had been the hero of  Kallias's tale. In a moment the quick Athenian perceived that the aged  man must stand in some very near relation to one or other of the victors  at Olympia; but when he heard that he was Aristomachus-the father of  that glorious pair of brothers, whose wondrous forms were constantly  hovering before his eyes like visions sent down from the abodes of the  gods, then he too gazed on the sobbing old man with mingled envy and  admiration, and made no effort to restrain the tears which rushed into  his own eyes, usually so clear and keen. In those days men wept, as well  as women, hoping to gain relief from the balm of their own tears. In  wrath, in ecstasy of delight, in every deep inward anguish, we find the  mighty heroes weeping, while, on the other hand, the Spartan boys would  submit to be scourged at the altar of Artemis Orthia, and would bleed  and even die under the lash without uttering a moan, in order to obtain  the praise of the men.    For a time every one remained silent, out of respect to the old man's  emotion. But at last the stillness was broken by Joshua the Jew, who  began thus, in broken Greek:    \"Weep thy fill, O man of Sparta! I also have known what it is to lose  a son. Eleven years have passed since I buried him in the land of  strangers, by the waters of Babylon, where my people pined in captivity.  Had yet one year been added unto the life of the beautiful child, he  had died in his own land, and had been buried in the sepulchres of his  fathers. But Cyrus the Persian (Jehovah bless his posterity!) released  us from bondage one year too late, and therefore do I weep doubly for  this my son, in that he is buried among the enemies of my people Israel.  Can there be an evil greater than to behold our children, who are unto  us as most precious treasure, go down into the grave before us? And, may  the Lord be gracious unto me, to lose so noble a son, in the dawn of his  early manhood, just at the moment he had won such brilliant renown, must  indeed be a bitter grief, a grief beyond all others!\"    Then the Spartan took away his hands from before his face; he was  looking stern, but smiled through his tears, and answered:    \"Phoenician, you err! I weep not for anguish, but for joy, and would  have gladly lost my other son, if he could have died like my Lysander.\"    The Jew, horrified at these, to him, sinful and unnatural words, shook  his head disapprovingly; but the Greeks overwhelmed the old man with  congratulations, deeming him much to be envied. His great happiness  made Aristomachus look younger by many years, and he cried to Rhodopis:  \"Truly, my friend, your house is for me a house of blessing; for this  is the second gift that the gods have allowed to fall to my lot, since  I entered it.\"--\"What was the first?\" asked Rhodopis. \"A propitious  oracle.\"--\"But,\" cried Phanes, \"you have forgotten the third; on this  day the gods have blessed you with the acquaintance of Rhodopis. But,  tell me, what is this about the oracle?\"--\"May I repeat it to our  friends?\" asked the Delphian.    Aristomachus nodded assent, and Phryxus read aloud a second time the  answer of the Pythia:      \"If once the warrior hosts from the snow-topped mountains descending     Come to the fields of the stream watering richly the plain,     Then shall the lingering boat to the beckoning meadows convey thee     Which to the wandering foot peace and a home will afford.     When those warriors come from the snow-topped mountains descending     Then will the powerful Five grant thee what they long refused.\"    Scarcely was the last word out of his mouth, when Kallias the Athenian,  springing up, cried: \"In this house, too, you shall receive from me the  fourth gift of the gods. Know that I have kept my rarest news till last:  the Persians are coming to Egypt!\"    At this every one, except the Sybarite, rushed to his feet, and Kallias  found it almost impossible to answer their numerous questions. \"Gently,  gently, friends,\" he cried at last; \"let me tell my story in order, or  I shall never finish it at all. It is not an army, as Phanes supposes,  that is on its way hither, but a great embassy from Cambyses, the  present ruler of the most powerful kingdom of Persia. At Samos I heard  that they had already reached Miletus, and in a few days they will be  here. Some of the king's own relations, are among the number, the aged  Croesus, king of Lydia, too; we shall behold a marvellous splendor  and magnificence! Nobody knows the object of their coming, but it is  supposed that King Cambyses wishes to conclude an alliance with Amasis;  indeed some say the king solicits the hand of Pharaoh's daughter.\"    \"An alliance?\" asked Phanes, with an incredulous shrug of the shoulders.  \"Why the Persians are rulers over half the world already. All the  great Asiatic powers have submitted to their sceptre; Egypt and our own  mother-country, Hellas, are the only two that have been shared by the  conqueror.\"    \"You forget India with its wealth of gold, and the great migratory  nations of Asia,\" answered Kallias. \"And you forget moreover, that  an empire, composed like Persia of some seventy nations or tribes of  different languages and customs, bears the seeds of discord ever within  itself, and must therefore guard against the chance of foreign attack;  lest, while the bulk of the army be absent, single provinces should  seize the opportunity and revolt from their allegiance. Ask the  Milesians how long they would remain quiet if they heard that their  oppressors had been defeated in any battle?\"    Theopompus, the Milesian merchant, called out, laughing at the same  time: \"If the Persians were to be worsted in one war, they"]]]
