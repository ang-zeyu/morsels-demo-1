All I contend for is, that, subordinate to the Supreme Agent,  there is a cause of a limited and inferior nature, which CONCURS in the  production of our ideas, not by any act of will, or spiritual efficiency,  but by that kind of action which belongs to Matter, viz. MOTION.    PHIL.  I find you are at every turn relapsing into your old exploded  conceit, of a moveable, and consequently an extended, substance, existing  without the mind. What! Have you already forgotten you were convinced; or  are you willing I should repeat what has been said on that head? In truth  this is not fair dealing in you, still to suppose the being of that which  you have so often acknowledged to have no being. But, not to insist  farther on what has been so largely handled, I ask whether all your ideas  are not perfectly passive and inert, including nothing of action in them.    HYL.  They are.    PHIL.  And are sensible qualities anything else but ideas?    HYL.  How often have I acknowledged that they are not.    PHIL.  But is not MOTION a sensible quality?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Consequently it is no action?    HYL.  I agree with you. And indeed it is very plain that when I stir my  finger, it remains passive; but my will which produced the motion is  active.    PHIL.  Now, I desire to know, in the first place, whether, motion being  allowed to be no action, you can conceive any action besides volition:  and, in the second place, whether to say something and conceive nothing  be not to talk nonsense: and, lastly, whether, having considered the  premises, you do not perceive that to suppose any efficient or active  Cause of our ideas, other than SPIRIT, is highly absurd and  unreasonable?    HYL.  I give up the point entirely. But, though Matter may not be a  cause, yet what hinders its being an INSTRUMENT, subservient to the  supreme Agent in the production of our ideas?    PHIL.  An instrument say you; pray what may be the figure, springs,  wheels, and motions, of that instrument?    HYL.  Those I pretend to determine nothing of, both the substance and  its qualities being entirely unknown to me.    PHIL.  What? You are then of opinion it is made up of unknown  parts, that it hath unknown motions, and an unknown shape?    HYL.  I do not believe that it hath any figure or motion at all, being  already convinced, that no sensible qualities can exist in an  unperceiving substance.    PHIL.  But what notion is it possible to frame of an instrument void of  all sensible qualities, even extension itself?    HYL.  I do not pretend to have any notion of it.    PHIL.  And what reason have you to think this unknown, this  inconceivable Somewhat doth exist? Is it that you imagine God cannot act  as well without it; or that you find by experience the use of some such  thing, when you form ideas in your own mind?    HYL.  You are always teasing me for reasons of my belief. Pray what  reasons have you not to believe it?    PHIL.  It is to me a sufficient reason not to believe the existence of  anything, if I see no reason for believing it. But, not to insist on  reasons for believing, you will not so much as let me know WHAT IT IS  you would have me believe; since you say you have no manner of notion of  it. After all, let me entreat you to consider whether it be like a  philosopher, or even like a man of common sense, to pretend to believe  you know not what and you know not why.    HYL.  Hold, Philonous. When I tell you Matter is an INSTRUMENT, I do  not mean altogether nothing. It is true I know not the particular kind of  instrument; but, however, I have some notion of INSTRUMENT IN GENERAL,  which I apply to it.    PHIL.  But what if it should prove that there is something, even in the  most general notion of INSTRUMENT, as taken in a distinct sense from  CAUSE, which makes the use of it inconsistent with the Divine  attributes?    HYL.  Make that appear and I shall give up the point.    PHIL.  What mean you by the general nature or notion of INSTRUMENT?    HYL.  That which is common to all particular instruments composeth the  general notion.    PHIL.  Is it not common to all instruments, that they are applied to the  doing those things only which cannot be performed by the mere act of our  wills? Thus, for instance, I never use an instrument to move my finger,  because it is done by a volition. But I should use one if I were to  remove part of a rock, or tear up a tree by the roots. Are you of the  same mind? Or, can you shew any example where an instrument is made  use of in producing an effect IMMEDIATELY depending on the will of the  agent?    HYL.  I own I cannot.    PHIL.  How therefore can you suppose that an All-perfect Spirit, on  whose Will all things have an absolute and immediate dependence, should  need an instrument in his operations, or, not needing it, make use of it?  Thus it seems to me that you are obliged to own the use of a lifeless  inactive instrument to be incompatible with the infinite perfection of  God; that is, by your own confession, to give up the point.    HYL.  It doth not readily occur what I can answer you.    PHIL.  But, methinks you should be ready to own the truth, when it has  been fairly proved to you. We indeed, who are beings of finite powers,  are forced to make use of instruments. And the use of an instrument  sheweth the agent to be limited by rules of another's prescription, and  that he cannot obtain his end but in such a way, and by such conditions.  Whence it seems a clear consequence, that the supreme unlimited agent  useth no tool or instrument at all. The will of an Omnipotent Spirit is  no sooner exerted than executed, without the application of means; which,  if they are employed by inferior agents, it is not upon account of any  real efficacy that is in them, or necessary aptitude to produce any  effect, but merely in compliance with the laws of nature, or those  conditions prescribed to them by the First Cause, who is Himself above  all limitation or prescription whatsoever.    HYL.  I will no longer maintain that Matter is an instrument. However, I  would not be understood to give up its existence neither; since,  notwithstanding what hath been said, it may still be an OCCASION.    PHIL.  How many shapes is your Matter to take? Or, how often must it be  proved not to exist, before you are content to part with it? But, to say  no more of this (though by all the laws of disputation I may justly blame  you for so frequently changing the signification of the principal  term)--I would fain know what you mean by affirming that matter is an  occasion, having already denied it to be a cause. And, when you have  shewn in what sense you understand OCCASION, pray, in the next place,  be pleased to shew me what reason induceth you to believe there is such  an occasion of our ideas?    HYL.  As to the first point: by OCCASION I mean an inactive  unthinking being, at the presence whereof God excites ideas in our minds.    PHIL.  And what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking being?    HYL.  I know nothing of its nature.    PHIL.  Proceed then to the second point, and assign some reason why we  should allow an existence to this inactive, unthinking, unknown thing.    HYL.  When we see ideas produced in our minds, after an orderly and  constant manner, it is natural to think they have some fixed and regular  occasions, at the presence of which they are excited.    PHIL.  You acknowledge then God alone to be the cause of our ideas, and  that He causes them at the presence of those occasions.    HYL.  That is my opinion.    PHIL.  Those things which you say are present to God, without doubt He  perceives.    HYL.  Certainly; otherwise they could not be to Him an occasion of acting.    PHIL.  Not to insist now on your making sense of this hypothesis, or  answering all the puzzling questions and difficulties it is liable to: I  only ask whether the order and regularity observable in the series of our  ideas, or the course of nature, be not sufficiently accounted for by the  wisdom and power of God; and whether it doth not derogate from those  attributes, to suppose He is influenced, directed, or put in mind, when  and what He is to act, by an unthinking substance? And, lastly, whether,  in case I granted all you contend for, it would make anything to your  purpose; it not being easy to conceive how the external or absolute  existence of an unthinking substance, distinct from its being perceived,  can be inferred from my allowing that there are certain things perceived  by the mind of God, which are to Him the occasion of producing ideas in  us?    HYL.  I am perfectly at a loss what to think, this notion of OCCASION  seeming now altogether as groundless as the rest.    PHIL.  Do you not at length perceive that in all these different  acceptations of MATTER, you have been only supposing you know not what,  for no manner of reason, and to no kind of use?    HYL.  I freely own myself less fond of my notions since they have been  so accurately examined. But still, methinks, I have some confused  perception that there is such a thing as MATTER.    PHIL.  Either you perceive the being of Matter immediately or mediately.  If immediately, pray inform me by which of the senses you perceive it. If  mediately, let me know by what reasoning it is inferred from those things  which you perceive immediately. So much for the perception. Then for the  Matter itself, I ask whether it is object, SUBSTRATUM, cause,  instrument, or occasion? You have already pleaded for each of these,  shifting your notions, and making Matter to appear sometimes in one  shape, then in another. And what you have offered hath been disapproved  and rejected by yourself. If you have anything new to advance I would  gladly bear it.    HYL.  I think I have already offered all I had to say on those heads. I  am at a loss what more to urge.    PHIL.

Then she turned to go in.    \"What's that sticking out of your wee pocket, Flossie girl?\"  he  said, as she brushed past him.  She stopped a second and felt.    \"Oh, nearly I didn't wemember, an' I pwomised I would--it's a  letter for you, Alan,\" she said, and gave Meg's poor little epistle  up into the very hands of the Philistine.          CHAPTER VIII    A Catapult and a Catastrophe         \"Oh, sweet pale Margaret,      Oh, rare pale Margaret,      What lit your eyes with tearful power?\"      The dusk had fallen very softly and tenderly over the garden,  and the paddocks, and the river.  There was just the faintest  wind at the waters edge, but it seemed almost too tired after the  hot, long day to breathe and make ripples.  Very slowly the grey,  still light deepened, and a white star or two came out and blinked  up away in the high, far heavens.  Down behind the gum trees,  across the river, there was a still whiter moon; a stretch of  water near was beginning to smile up to it.  Meg hoped it  would not climb past the tree-tops before eight o'clock, or the  long paddocks would be flooded with light and she would be seen.  At tea-time, and during the early part of the evening, she was  preoccupied and inclined to be irritable in her anxiety, and she  snubbed Bunty two or three times quite unkindly.    He had been hovering about her ever since six o'clock in almost  a pitiable way.    It was characteristic of this small boy that when he had been tempted  into departing from the paths of truth he was absolutely wretched  until he had confessed, and rubbed his little unclean hands into  his wet eyes until he was \"a sight to dream of, not to tell.\"    Pip said it was because he was a coward, and had not the moral  courage to go to sleep with a lie on his soul, for fear he might  wake up and see an angel with a fiery sword standing by his  bedside.  And I must sorrowfully acknowledge this seemed a truer  view of the case than believing the boy was really impressed  with the heinousness of his offence and anxious to make amends.  For the very next day, if occasion sufficiently strong offered,  he would fall again, and the very next night would creep up to  somebody and whimper, with his knuckles in his eyes, that he had  \"t--t--told a s--s--story, boo--hoo!\"    By seven o'clock this particular evening he was miserably  repentant; several tears had trickled down, his cheeks and mingled  with the ink of the map he was engaged upon for Miss Marsh.  He  established himself at Meg's elbow, and kept looking up into her  face in a yearning love-and-forgive-me kind of way that she found  infinitely embarrassing; for she had begun to suspect, from his  strange conduct, that he had in some way learned the contents  of her note, and was trying to discourage her from her enterprise.  The more he gazed at her the redder and more uncomfortable she  became.    \"You can have my new c--c--catapult,\" he whispered once, giving  her a tearful, imploring look, that she interpreted as an entreaty  to stay safely at home.    At last the clock had travelled up to eight, and the children being  engaged in a wordy warfare over the possession of a certain stray  dog that had come to Misrule in the afternoon, she slipped out of  the room unobserved.  No one was in the hall, and she picked up  the becoming, fleecy cloud she had hidden there, twisted it round  her head, and crept out of the side door and along the first path.    Down in the garden the ground was white with fallen rose leaves,  and the air full of their dying breath; a clump of pampas grass  stood tall and soft against the sky; some native trees, left  growing among the cultivated shrubs, stretched silver-white  arms up to the moon and gave the little hurrying figure a ghostly  kind of feeling.  Out of the gate and into the first paddock,  where the rose scent did not come at all, and only a pungent smell  of wattle was in the thin, hushed air.  More gum trees, and more  white, ghostly arms; then a sharp movement near the fence, a thick,  sepulchral whisper, and a stifled scream from Meg.    \"Here's the c--c--c--catapult, M--Meg; t--take it,\" Bunty said,  his face white and miserable.    \"You little stupid! What do you mean coming creeping here like  this?\" Meg said, angry as soon as her heart began to beat  again.    \"I only w--wanted to p--p--please you, M--M-Meggie,\" the little  boy said, with a bitter sob in his voice.    He had put both his arms round her waist, and was burying his nose  in her white muslin dress.  She shook him off hastily.    \"All right; there--thanks,\" she said.  \"Now go home, Bunty;  I want to have a quiet walk in the moonlight by myself.\"    He screwed his knuckles as far into his eyes as they would go,  his mouth opened, and his lower lip dropped down, down.    \"I t--t--told y--y--you a b--b--big st--st--story;\" he wept,  rocking to and fro where he stood.    \"Did you?  Oh, all right!  Now go home,\" she said impatiently.  \"You always ARE telling stories, Bunty, you know, so I'm not  surprised. There-go along.\"    \"But--but I'm--must tell you all ab--ab--about it,\" he said,  still engaged in driving his eyes into his head.    \"No, you needn't; I'll forgive you this time,\" she said  magnanimously, \"only don't do it again.  Now run away at once,  or you won't have your map done, and miss Marsh will punish you.\"    His eyes returned to their proper position, likewise his hands.  His heart was perfectly light again as he turned to go back to the  house.  When he had gone a few steps he came back.    \"D'ye want that catapult very much, Meg?\" he said gently.  \"You're only a girl, so I don't 'spect it would be very much  good to you, would it?\"    \"No, I don't want it.  Here, take it, and hurry back: think of  your map,\" Meg returned, in a very fever of impatience at his  slowness.    And then Bunty, utterly happy once more, turned and ran away gaily  up to the house.  And Meg let down the slip-rail, put it back in  its place with trembling fingers, and fled in wild haste through  the two remaining paddocks.    The wattle-scrub at the end was very quiet; there was not a rustle,  not a sound of a voice, not a sound of the affected little laugh  that generally told when Aldith was near.    Meg stopped breathless, and peered among the bushes; there was a  tall figure leaning against the fence.    \"Andrew!\" she said in a sharp whisper, and forgetting in her  anxiety that she never called him by his Christian name--\"where  are the others?  Hasn't Aldith come?\"    There was the smell of a cigar, and, looking closely, she saw to  her horror it was Alan.    \"Oh!\" she said, in an indescribable tone.    Her heart gave one frightened, shamed bound, and then seemed  to stop beating altogether.    She looked up, at him as if entreating him not to have too bad an  opinion of her; but his face wore the contemptuous look she had  grown to dread and his lips were finely curled.    \"I--I only came out for a little walk; it is such a beautiful  evening,\" she said, with miserable lameness; and then in a tone  of justification she added, \"it's my father's paddock, too.\"    He leaned back against he fence and looked down at her.    \"Flossie gave me your note, and as it seemed addressed to me, and  I was told it was for me; I opened it,\" he said.    \"You KNEW it was for Andrew,\" she said not looking at him, however.    \"So I presumed when I had read it,\" he returned slowly; \"but  Andrew has not come back to-night yet, so I came instead; it's all  the same as long as it's a boy, isn't it?\"    The girl made no reply, only put her hand up and drew the cloud  more closely round her head.    His lips curled a little more.    \"And I know how to kiss, too, I assure you.  I am quite a good hand  at it, though you may not think so.  Oh yes, I know you said you  did not want to be kissed; but then, girls always say that, don't  they?--even when they expect it most.\"    Still Meg did not speak, and the calm, merciless voice went on.    \"I am afraid it is hardly dark enough for you, is it?  The moon  is very much in the way, do you not think so?  Still, perhaps we  can find a darker place farther on, and then I can kiss you without  danger.  What is the matter?--are you always as quiet as this with  Andrew?\"    \"Oh, DON'T!\" said Meg, in a choking voice.    The mocking tone died instantly out of his voice, \"Miss Meg, you  used to seem such a nice little girl,\" he said quietly; \"what  have you let that horrid MacCarthy girl spoil you for?  For she is  horrid, though you may not think so.\"    Meg did not speak or move, and he went on with a gentle earnestness  that she had not thought him capable of..    \"I have watched her on the boat, systematically going to work to  spoil you, and can't help thinking of the pity of it.  I imagined  how I should feel if my little sister Flossie ever fell in with  such a girl, and began to flirt and make herself conspicuous,  and I wondered would you mind if I spoke to you about it.  Are you very angry with me, Miss Meg?\"    But Meg leaned her head against the rough fence and began to  sob--little, dry, heartbroken sobs that went to the boy's warm  heart.    \"I oughtn't to have spoken as I did at first--I was a perfect  brute,\" he said remorsefully; \"forgive me, won't you?  Please,  little Miss Meg--I would rather cut my hand off than really hurt  you.\"    This last was a little consoling, at any rate, and Meg lifted her  face half a second, white and pathetic in the moonlight, and all  wet with grievous tears.    \"I--I--oh! indeed I have not been quite so horrid as you think,\"  she said brokenly; \"I didn't want to come this walk--and oh!  indeed, indeed, indeed I wouldn't allow ANYONE to kiss me.  Oh,  PLEASE do believe me!\"    \"I do, I do indeed,\" he said eagerly; \"I"]]]
