But you  look cozy enough in there.\"    It did, indeed, look cheerful in contrast to the damp and dark jungle  all about.  Professor Bumper, being an experienced traveler, knew how  to provide for such comforts as were possible.  Folding cots had been  opened for himself, Mr. Damon and the guide to sleep on, others,  similar, being set up in the tent where Tom and Ned were to sleep.  In  the middle of the tent the professor had made a table of his own and  Mr. Damon's suit cases, and on this placed a small dry battery electric  light.  He was making some notes, doubtless for a future book.  Jacinto  was going about the camp, seeing that the Indians were at their duties,  though most of them had gone directly to sleep after supper.    \"Better get inside and under the nets,\" advised Professor Bumper to Tom  and Ned.  \"The mosquitoes here are the worst I ever saw.\"    \"We're beginning to believe that,\" returned Ned, who was unusually  quiet.  \"Come on, Tom.  I can't stand it any longer.  I'm itching in a  dozen places now from their bites.\"    As Tom and Ned had no wish for a light, which would be sure to attract  insects, they entered their tent in the dark, and were soon stretched  out in comparative comfort.  Tom was just on the edge of a deep sleep  when he heard Ned murmur:    \"I can't understand it!\"    \"What's that?\" asked the young inventor.    \"I say I can't understand it.\"    \"Understand what?\"    \"That shadow.  It was real and yet----\"    \"Oh, go to sleep!\" advised Tom, and, turning over, he was soon  breathing heavily and regularly, indicating that he, at least, had  taken his own advice.    Ned, too, finally succumbed to the overpowering weariness of the first  day of travel, and he, too, slept, though it was an uneasy slumber,  disturbed by a feeling as though some one were holding a heavy black  quilt over his head, preventing him from breathing.    The feeling, sensation or dream--whatever it was--perhaps a  nightmare--became at last so real to Ned that he struggled himself into  wakefulness.  With an effort he sat up, uttering an inarticulate cry.  To his surprise he was answered.  Some one asked:    \"What is the matter?\"    \"Who--who are you?\" asked Ned quickly, trying to peer through the  darkness.    \"This is Jacinto--your guide,\" was the soft answer.  \"I was walking  about camp and, hearing you murmuring, I came to your tent.  Is  anything wrong?\"    For a moment Ned did not answer.  He listened and could tell by the  continued heavy and regular breathing of his chum that Tom was still  asleep.    \"Are you in our tent?\" asked Ned, at length:    \"Yes,\" answered Jacinto.  \"I came in to see what was the matter with  you.  Are you ill?\"    \"No, of course not,\" said Ned, a bit shortly.  \"I--I had a bad dream,  that was all.  All right now.\"    \"For that I am glad.  Try to get all the sleep you can, for we must  start early to avoid the heat of the day,\" and there was the sound of  the guide leaving and arranging the folds of the mosquito net behind  him to keep out the night-flying insects.    Once more Ned composed himself to sleep, and this time successfully,  for he did not have any more unpleasant dreams.  The quiet of the  jungle settled down over the camp, at least the comparative quiet of  the jungle, for there were always noises of some sort going on, from  the fall of some rotten tree limb to the scream or growl of a wild  beast, while, now and again, from the river came the pig-like grunts of  the alligators.    It was about two o'clock in the morning, as they ascertained later,  when the whole camp--white travelers and all--was suddenly awakened by  a wild scream.  It seemed to come from one of the natives, who called  out a certain word ever and over again.  To Tom and Ned it sounded like:    \"Oshtoo! Oshtoo! Oshtoo!\"    \"What's the matter?\" cried Professor Bumper.    \"The vampires!\" came the answering voice of Jacinto.  \"One of the  Indians has been attacked by a big vampire bat! Look out, every one!  It may be a raid by the dangerous creatures!  Be careful!\"    Notwithstanding this warning Ned stuck his head out of the tent.  The  same instant he was aware of a dark enfolding shadow passing over him,  and, with a shudder of fear, he jumped back.          CHAPTER XII    A FALSE FRIEND      \"What is it?  What's the matter?\" cried Tom springing from his cot and  hastening to the side of his chum in the tent.  \"What has happened,  Ned?\"    \"I don't know, but Jacinto is yelling something about vampires!\"    \"Vampires?\"    \"Yes.  Big bats.  And he's warning us to be careful.  I stuck my head  out just now and I felt that same sort of shadow I felt this evening  when we were down near the river.\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"I tell you I did!\"    At that instant Tom flashed a pocket electric lamp he had taken from  beneath his pillow and in the gleam of it he and Ned saw fluttering  about the tent some dark, shadow-like form, at the sight of which Tom's  chum cried:    \"There it is! That's the shadow! Look out!\" and he held up his hands  instinctively to shield his face.    \"Shadow!\" yelled Tom, unconsciously adding to the din that seemed to  pervade every part of the camp.  \"That isn't a shadow.  It's substance.  It's a monster bat, and here goes for a strike at it!\"    He caught up his camera tripod which was near his cot, and made a swing  with it at the creature that had flown into the tent through an opening  it had made for itself.    \"Look out!\" yelled Ned.  \"If it's a vampire it'll----\"    \"It won't do anything to me!\" shouted Tom, as he struck the creature,  knocking it into the corner of the tent with a thud that told it must  be completely stunned, if not killed.  \"But what's it all about,  anyhow?\" Tom asked.  \"What's the row?\"    From without the tent came the Indian cries of:    \"Oshtoo!  Oshtoo!\"    Mingled with them were calls of Jacinto, partly in Spanish, partly in  the Indian tongue and partly in English.    \"It is a raid by vampire bats!\" was all Tom and Ned could distinguish.  \"We shall have to light fires to keep them away, if we can succeed.  Every one grab up a club and strike hard!\"    \"Come on!\" cried Tom, getting on some clothes by the light of his  gleaming electric light which he had set on his cot.    \"You're not going out there, are you?\" asked Ned.    \"I certainly am! If there's a fight I want to be in it, bats or  anything else.  Here, you have a light like mine.  Flash it on, and  hang it somewhere on yourself.  Then get a club and come on.  The  lights will blind the bats, and we can see to hit 'em!\"    Tom's plan seemed to be a good one.  His lamp and Ned's had small hooks  on them, so they could be carried in the upper coat pocket, showing a  gleam of light and leaving the hands free for use.    Out of the tents rushed the young men to find Professor Bumper and Mr.  Damon before them.  The two men had clubs and were striking about in  the half darkness, for now the Indians had set several fires aglow.  And in the gleams, constantly growing brighter as more fuel was piled  on, the young inventor and his chum saw a weird sight.    Circling and wheeling about in the camp clearing were many of the black  shadowy forms that had caused Ned such alarm.  Great bats they were,  and a dangerous species, if Jacinto was to be believed.    The uncanny creatures flew in and out among the trees and tents, now  swooping low near the Indians or the travelers.  At such times clubs  would be used, often with the effect of killing or stunning the flying  pests.  For a time it seemed as if the bats would fairly overwhelm the  camp, so many of them were there.  But the increasing lights, and the  attacks made by the Indians and the white travelers turned the tide of  battle, and, with silent flappings of their soft, velvety wings, the  bats flew back to the jungle whence they had emerged.    \"We are safe--for the present!\" exclaimed Jacinto with a sigh of relief.    \"Do you think they will come back?\" asked Tom.    \"They may--there is no telling.\"    \"Bless my speedometer!\" cried Mr. Damon, \"If those beasts or  birds--whatever they are--come back I'll go and hide in the river and  take my chances with the alligators!\"    \"The alligators aren't much worse,\" asserted Jacinto with a visible  shiver.  \"These vampire bats sometimes depopulate a whole village.\"    \"Bless my shoe laces!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"You don't mean to say that  the creatures can eat up a whole village?\"    \"Not quite.  Though they might if they got the chance,\" was the answer  of the Spanish guide.  \"These vampire bats fly from place to place in  great swarms, and they are so large and blood-thirsty that a few of  them can kill a horse or an ox in a short time by sucking its blood.  So when the villagers find they are visited by a colony of these  vampires they get out, taking their live stock with them, and stay in  caves or in densely wooded places until the bats fly on.  Then the  villagers come back.    \"It was only a small colony that visited us tonight or we would have  had more trouble.  I do not think this lot will come back.  We have  killed too many of them,\" and he looked about on the ground where many  of the uncanny creatures were still twitching in the death struggle.    \"Come back again!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my skin! I hope not! I've  had enough of bats--and mosquitoes,\" he added, as he slapped at his  face and neck.    Indeed the party of whites were set upon by the night insects to such  an extent that it was necessary to hurry back to the protection of the  nets.    Tom and Ned kicked outside the bat the former had killed in their tent,  and then both went back to their cots.  But it was some little time  before they fell asleep.  And they did not have much time to rest, for  an early start must be made to avoid the terrible heat of the middle of  the day.    \"Whew!\" whistled Ned, as he and Tom arose in the gray dawn of the  morning when Jacinto announced the breakfast which the Indian cook "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5000"],[0,"The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci — Complete (#11)"],[1,"THE OPENING.    It is impossible that the line should intersect itself; that is,  that its right should cross over to its left side, and so, its left  side become its right side. Because such an intersection demands two  lines, one from each side; for there can be no motion from right to  left or from left to right in itself without such extension and  thickness as admit of such motion. And if there is extension it is  no longer a line but a surface, and we are investigating the  properties of a line, and not of a surface. And as the line, having  no centre of thickness cannot be divided, we must conclude that the  line can have no sides to intersect each other. This is proved by  the movement of the line _a f_ to _a b_ and of the line _e b_ to _e  f_, which are the sides of the surface _a f e b_. But if you move  the line _a b_ and the line _e f_, with the frontends _a e_, to the  spot _c_, you will have moved the opposite ends _f b_ towards each  other at the point _d_. And from the two lines you will have drawn  the straight line _c d_ which cuts the middle of the intersection of  these two lines at the point _n_ without any intersection. For, you  imagine these two lines as having breadth, it is evident that by  this motion the first will entirely cover the other--being equal  with it--without any intersection, in the position _c d_. And this  is sufficient to prove our proposition.    81.    HOW THE INNUMERABLE RAYS FROM INNUMERABLE IMAGES CAN CONVERGE TO A  POINT.    Just as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each  other--being without breadth or thickness--in the same way all the  images of surfaces can meet there; and as each given point faces the  object opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point, the  converging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge  again beyond it to reproduce and re-magnify the real size of that  image. But their impressions will appear reversed--as is shown in  the first, above; where it is said that every image intersects as it  enters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance.    Read the marginal text on the other side.    In proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body, so  much less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect  each other. The sides of images which pass through openings into a  dark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in  proportion as the opening is narrower. To prove this let _a b_ be an  object in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image  of its darkened form through the opening _d e_ which is as wide as  this shaded body; and its sides _a b_, being straight lines (as has  been proved) must intersect between the shaded object and the  opening; but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller  than the object in shade. As is shown, on your right hand and your  left hand, in the two diagrams _a_ _b_ _c_ _n_ _m_ _o_ where, the  right opening _d_ _e_, being equal in width to the shaded object _a_  _b_, the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs  half way between the opening and the shaded object at the point _c_.  But this cannot happen in the left hand figure, the opening _o_  being much smaller than the shaded object _n_ _m_.    It is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between  the objects and the openings through which the images of these  bodies are admitted; and this is plain, because where the atmosphere  is illuminated these images are not formed visibly.    When the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they  are invariably doubly as dark in tone. To prove this let _d_ _e_ _h_  be such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space  between the bodies in _b_ and _i_ this will not hinder its being  seen from _f_ _g_ or from _f_ _m_; being composed of the images _a_  _b_ _i_ _k_ which run together in _d_ _e_ _h_.    [Footnote: 81. On the original diagram at the beginning of this  chapter Leonardo has written \"_azurro_\" (blue) where in the  facsimile I have marked _A_, and \"_giallo_\" (yellow) where _B_  stands.]    [Footnote: 15--23.

An experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from  its position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their  places.    If you look at an object at some distance from you and which is  below the eye, and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand  firmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the  under lid--still keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed at--you  will see that object double; one [image] remaining steady, and the  other moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger  on the lower eyelid. How false the opinion is of those who say that  this happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its  position.    How the above mentioned facts prove that the pupil acts upside down  in seeing.    [Footnote: 82. 14--17. The subject indicated by these two headings is  fully discussed in the two chapters that follow them in the  original; but it did not seem to me appropriate to include them  here.]    Demostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane  (83-85).    83.    OF THE PLANE OF GLASS.    Perspective is nothing else than seeing place [or objects] behind a  plane of glass, quite transparent, on the surface of which the  objects behind that glass are to be drawn. These can be traced in  pyramids to the point in the eye, and these pyramids are intersected  on the glass plane.    84.    Pictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance,  look of the same size as it appears to the eye. You see that the  apex of the pyramid _f c d_ is as far from the object _c_ _d_ as the  same point _f_ is from the object _a_ _b_; and yet _c_ _d_, which is  the base made by the painter's point, is smaller than _a_ _b_ which  is the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and  refracted at _s_ _t_, the surface of the eye. This may be proved by  experiment, by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the  painter's plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and  the same plane and measuring on it one and the same object.    85.    PERSPECTIVE.    The vertical plane is a perpendicular line, imagined as in front of  the central point where the apex of the pyramids converge. And this  plane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass  would, through which you might see the various objects and draw them  on it. And the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the  originals, in proportion as the distance between the glass and the  eye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects.    PERSPECTIVE.    The different converging pyramids produced by the objects, will  show, on the plane, the various sizes and remoteness of the objects  causing them.    PERSPECTIVE.    All those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by  perpendicular lines forming right angles, if they are of equal width  the more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen, and  the more the eye is above them the more will their real width be  seen.    PERSPECTIVE.    The farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see  of it.    The angle of sight varies with the distance (86-88)    86.    A simple and natural method; showing how objects appear to the eye  without any other medium.    The object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than  another of the same size at greater distance. The eye _m_, seeing  the spaces _o v x_, hardly detects the difference between them, and  the. reason of this is that it is close to them [Footnote 6: It is  quite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French  translation of this simple passage should have remarked: _Il est  clair que c'est par erreur que Leonard a ècrit_ per esser visino _au  lieu de_ per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.  38.)]; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane _n o_  the space _o v_ will be seen at _o r_, and in the same way the space  _v x_ will appear at _r q_. And if you carry this out in any place  where you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason  of the great difference in the spaces _o r_ and _r q_. And this  proceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the  plane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you  would have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole  which must be at the point _m_, or else you must go to a distance of  at least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane _o p_  being always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects  in a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.    87.    How every large mass sends forth its images, which may diminish  through infinity.    The images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be  infinitely diminished.    88.    Objects of equal size, situated in various places, will be seen by  different pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the  object is farther off.    89.    Perspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite  pyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as  distant as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and  the apex on the horizon. Now, the first includes the [visible]  universe, embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of  the eye; as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small  opening; for the more remote the objects are from the eye, the  greater number can be seen through the opening, and thus the pyramid  is constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye,  as has been said.
