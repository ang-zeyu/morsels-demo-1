There is an importance, perhaps,      attached to this subject, which the world has not so fully examined      as it requires. Think for a moment, of the greatness of the Being      who created the Universe; and {14} ask, could He be so inconsistent      with his own character, as to leave man without a law or rule by      which to regulate his conduct, after placing him here, where,      according to the formation of his nature he must in a short period      sink into the dust? Is there nothing further; is there no existence      beyond this vail of death which is so suddenly to be cast over      all of us? If there is, why not that Being who had power to place      us here, inform us something of the hereafter? If we had power to      place ourselves in this present existence, why not have power to      know what shall follow when that dark veil is cast over our bodies?      If in this life we receive our all; if when we crumble back to      dust we are no more, from what source did we emanate, and what was      the purpose of our existence? If this life were all, we should be      led to query, whether or not there was really any substance in      existence, and we might with propriety say, \"Let us eat, drink,      and be merry, for tomorrow we die!\" But if this life is all, then      why this constant toiling, why this continual warfare, and why      this unceasing trouble? But this life is not all, the voice of      _reason_, the language of _inspiration_, and the Spirit of the      living God, our Creator, teaches us, as we hold the record of      truth in our hands, that this is not the case, that this is not      so; for, the heavens declare the glory of a God, and the firmament      showeth His handiwork; and a moment's reflection is sufficient to      teach every man of common intelligence, that all these are not the      mere productions of _chance_, nor could they be supported by any      power less than an Almighty hand; and He that can mark the power      of Omnipotence, inscribed upon the heavens, can also see God's own      handwriting in the sacred volume: and he who reads it oftenest will      like it best, and he who is acquainted with it, will know the hand      wherever he can see it; and when once discovered, it will not only      receive an acknowledgment, but an obedience to all his heavenly      precepts. For a moment reflect: what could have been the purpose of      our Father in giving to us a law? Was it that it might be obeyed,      or disobeyed? And think further, too, not only of the propriety,      but of the importance of attending to His laws in every particular.      If, then, there is an importance in this respect, is there not a      responsibility of great weight resting upon those who are called to      declare these truths to men? Were we capable of laying any thing      before you as a just comparison, we would cheerfully do it; but      in this our ability fails, and we are inclined to think that man      is unable, without assistance beyond what has been given to those      before, of expressing in words the greatness of this important      subject. We can only say, that if an anticipation of the joys of      the celestial glory, as witnessed to the hearts of the humble is      not sufficient, we will leave to yourselves the result of your      own diligence; for God ere long, will call {15} all His servants      before Him, and there from His own hand they will receive a just      recompense and a righteous reward for all their labors. * * * * * *      * * * * * * *        It is reasonable to suppose, that man departed from the first      teachings, or instructions which he received from heaven in the      first age, and refused by his disobedience to be governed by them.      Consequently, he formed such laws as best suited his own mind, or      as he supposed, were best adapted to his situation. But that God      had influenced man more or less since that time in the formation      of law for His benefit we have no hesitancy in believing; for,      as before remarked, being the source of all good, every just      and equitable law was in a greater or less degree influenced by      Him. And though man in his own supposed wisdom would not admit      the influence of a power superior to his own, yet for wise and      great purposes, for the good and happiness of His creatures, God      has instructed man to form wise and wholesome laws, since he had      departed from Him and refused to governed by those laws which God      had given by His own voice from on high in the beginning. But      notwithstanding the transgression, by which man had cut himself off      from an immediate intercourse with his Masker without a Mediator,      it appears that the great and glorious plan of His redemption was      previously provided; the sacrifice prepared; the atonement wrought      out in the mind and purpose of God, even in the person of the Son,      through whom man was now to look for acceptance, and through whose      merits he was now taught that he alone could find redemption, since      the word had been pronounced, Unto dust thou shalt return.        But that man was not able himself to erect a system, or plan with      power sufficient to free him from a destruction which awaited him,      is evident from the fact that God, as before remarked, prepared      a sacrifice in the gift of His own Son who should be sent in due      time, to prepare a way, or open a door through which man might      enter into the Lord's presence, whence he had been cast out for      disobedience. From time to time these glad tidings were sounded in      the ears of men in different ages of the world down to the time of      Messiah's coming. By faith in this atonement or plan of redemption,      Abel offered to God a sacrifice that was accepted, which was the      firstlings of the flock. Cain offered of the fruit of the ground,      and was not accepted, because he could not do it in faith, he could      have no faith, or could not exercise faith contrary to the plan      of heaven. It must be shedding the blood of the only Begotten to      atone for man; for this was the plan of redemption, and without      the shedding of blood was no remission; and as the sacrifice was      instituted for a type, by which man was to discern the great      Sacrifice which God had prepared; to offer a sacrifice contrary      to that, no faith could be exercised, because redemption was not      purchased in that way, nor the {16} power of atonement instituted      after that order; consequently Cain could have no faith; and      whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. But Abel offered an acceptable      sacrifice, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous,      God Himself testifying of his gifts. Certainly, the shedding of      the blood of a beast could be beneficial to no man, except it was      done in imitation, or as a type, or explanation of what was to      be offered through the gift of God Himself; and this performance      done with an eye looking forward in faith on the power of that      great Sacrifice for a remission of sins. But however various may      have been, and may be at the present time, the opinions of men      respecting the conduct of Abel, and the knowledge which he had on      the subject of atonement, it is evident in our minds, that he was      instructed more fully in the plan than what the Bible speaks of,      for how could he offer a sacrifice in faith, looking to God for a      remission of his sins in the power of the great atonement, without      having been previously instructed in that plan? And further, if he      was accepted of God, what were the ordinances performed further      than the offering of the firstlings of the flock?        It is said by Paul in his letter to the Hebrew brethren, that Abel      obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his      gifts. To whom did God testify of the gifts of Abel, was it to      Paul? We have very little on this important subject in the forepart      of the Bible. But it is said that Abel himself obtained witness      that he was righteous. Then certainly God spoke to him: indeed,      it is said that God talked with him; and if He did, would He not,      seeing that Abel was righteous, deliver to him the whole plan of      the Gospel. And is not the Gospel the news of the redemption? How      could Abel offer a sacrifice and look forward with faith on the Son      of God for a remission of his sins and not understand the Gospel?      The mere shedding of the blood of beasts or offering anything      else in sacrifice, could not procure a remission of sins, except      it were performed in faith of something to come; if it could,      Cain's offering must have been as good as Abel's. And if Abel was      taught of the coming of the Son of God, was he not taught also of      His ordinances? We all admit that the Gospel has ordinances, and      if so, had it not always ordinances, and were not its ordinances      always the same? Perhaps our friends will say that the Gospel and      its ordinances were not known till the days of John, the son of      Zacharias, in the days of Herod, the king of Judea. But we will      here look at this point: For our own part we cannot believe that      the ancients in all ages were so ignorant of the system of heaven      as many suppose, since all that were ever saved, were saved through      the power of this great plan of redemption, as much before the      coming of Christ as since; if not, God has had different plans in      operation (if we may so express it), to bring men back to dwell      with Himself; and this we cannot believe, {17} since there has      been no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#11)"],[1,"multitude of created  beings, which they acknowledge are not capable of producing any one  effect in nature, and which therefore are made to no manner of purpose,  since God might have done everything as well without them: this I say,  though we should allow it possible, must yet be a very unaccountable and  extravagant supposition.    54. EIGHTH OBJECTION.--TWOFOLD ANSWER.--In the eighth place, the  universal concurrent assent of mankind may be thought by some  an invincible argument in behalf of Matter, or the existence of  external things. Must we suppose the whole world to be mistaken?  And if so, what cause can be assigned of so widespread and predominant  an error? I answer, FIRST, that, upon a narrow inquiry, it will  not perhaps be found so many as is imagined do really believe the  existence of Matter or things without the mind. Strictly speaking, to  believe that which involves a contradiction, or has no meaning in it, is  impossible; and whether the foregoing expressions are not of that sort, I  refer it to the impartial examination of the reader. In one sense,  indeed, men may be said to believe that Matter exists, that is, they ACT  as if the immediate cause of their sensations, which affects them every  moment, and is so nearly present to them, were some senseless unthinking  being. But, that they should clearly apprehend any meaning marked by  those words, and form thereof a settled SPECULATIVE opinion, is what I am  not able to conceive. This is not the only instance wherein men impose  upon themselves, by imagining they believe those propositions which they  have often heard, though at bottom they have no meaning in them.    55. But SECONDLY, though we should grant a notion to be never so  universally and steadfastly adhered to, yet this is weak argument of its  truth to whoever considers what a vast number of prejudices and false  opinions are everywhere embraced with the utmost tenaciousness, by the  unreflecting (which are the far greater) part of mankind. There was a  time when the antipodes and motion of the earth were looked upon as  monstrous absurdities even by men of learning: and if it be considered  what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind, we shall find  that at this day those notions have gained but a very inconsiderable  footing in the world.    56. NINTH OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--But it is demanded that we assign  A CAUSE OF THIS PREJUDICE, and account for its obtaining in the  world. To this I ANSWER, that men knowing they perceived several  ideas, WHEREOF THEY THEMSELVES WERE NOT THE AUTHORS--as not being  excited from within nor depending on the operation of their wills--this  made them maintain those ideas, or objects of perception had an  EXISTENCE INDEPENDENT OF AND WITHOUT THE MIND, without ever dreaming  that a contradiction was involved in those words. But, philosophers  having plainly seen that the immediate objects of perception do  not exist without the mind, THEY IN SOME DEGREE CORRECTED the  mistake of the vulgar; but at the same time run into another which  seems no less absurd, to wit, that there are certain objects really  existing without the mind, or having a subsistence distinct from being  perceived, OF WHICH OUR IDEAS ARE ONLY IMAGES or resemblances, imprinted  by those objects on the mind. And this notion of the philosophers owes  its origin to the same cause with the former, namely, their being  conscious that they were not the authors of their own sensations, which  they evidently knew were imprinted from without, and which therefore must  have some cause distinct from the minds on which they are imprinted.    57. BUT WHY THEY SHOULD SUPPOSE THE IDEAS OF SENSE TO BE EXCITED IN US BY  THINGS IN THEIR LIKENESS, and not rather have recourse to SPIRIT which  alone can act, may be accounted for, FIRST, because they were not aware  of the repugnancy there is, (1) as well in supposing things like unto our  ideas existing without, as in (2) attributing to them POWER OR ACTIVITY.  SECONDLY, because the Supreme Spirit which excites those ideas in our  minds, is not marked out and limited to our view by any particular finite  collection of sensible ideas, as human agents are by their size,  complexion, limbs, and motions. And thirdly, because His operations are  regular and uniform. Whenever the course of nature is interrupted by a  miracle, men are ready to own the presence of a superior agent. But, when  we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any  reflexion; their order and concatenation, though it be an argument of the  greatest wisdom, power, and goodness in their creator, is yet so constant  and familiar to us that we do not think them the immediate effects of a  Free Spirit; especially since inconsistency and mutability in acting,  though it be an imperfection, is looked on as a mark of freedom.    58. TENTH OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--Tenthly, it will be objected that  the notions we advance are inconsistent with several sound truths  in philosophy and mathematics. For example, the motion of the earth  is now universally admitted by astronomers as a truth grounded on  the clearest and most convincing reasons. But, on the foregoing  principles, there can be no such thing. For, motion being only an  idea, it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not; but the  motion of the earth is not perceived by sense. I answer, that tenet,  if rightly understood, will be found to agree with the principles  we have premised; for, the question whether the earth moves or no  amounts in reality to no more than this, to wit, whether we have  reason to conclude, from what has been observed by astronomers, that  if we were placed in such and such circumstances, and such or such a  position and distance both from the earth and sun, we should perceive the  former to move among the choir of the planets, and appearing in all  respects like one of them; and this, by the established rules of nature  which we have no reason to mistrust, is reasonably collected from the  phenomena.    59. We may, from the experience we have had of the train and succession  of ideas in our minds, often make, I will not say uncertain conjectures,  but sure and well--grounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be  affected with pursuant to a great train of actions, and be enabled to  pass a right judgment of what would have appeared to us, in case we were  placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present.  Herein consists the knowledge of nature, which may preserve its use and  certainty very consistently with what has been said. It will be easy to  apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be drawn from the  magnitude of the stars, or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature.    60. ELEVENTH OBJECTION.--In the eleventh place, it will be demanded  to what purpose serves that curious organization of plants, and the  animal mechanism in the parts of animals; might not vegetables grow,  and shoot forth leaves of blossoms, and animals perform all their  motions as well without as with all that variety of internal parts  so elegantly contrived and put together; which, being ideas, have  nothing powerful or operative in them, nor have any necessary connexion  with the effects ascribed to them? If it be a Spirit that immediately  produces every effect by a fiat or act of his will, we must think all  that is fine and artificial in the works, whether of man or nature,  to be made in vain. By this doctrine, though an artist has made the  spring and wheels, and every movement of a watch, and adjusted them  in such a manner as he knew would produce the motions he designed,  yet he must think all this done to no purpose, and that it is an  Intelligence which directs the index, and points to the hour of the  day. If so, why may not the Intelligence do it, without his being at the  pains of making the movements and putting them together? Why does not an  empty case serve as well as another? And how comes it to pass that  whenever there is any fault in the going of a watch, there is some  corresponding disorder to be found in the movements, which being mended  by a skilful hand all is right again? The like may be said of all the  clockwork of nature, great part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtle  as scarce to be discerned by the best microscope. In short, it will be  asked, how, upon our principles, any tolerable account can be given, or  any final cause assigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and  machines, framed with the most exquisite art, which in the common  philosophy have very apposite uses assigned them, and serve to explain  abundance of phenomena?    61. ANSWER.--To all which I answer, first, that though there were some  difficulties relating to the administration of Providence, and the uses  by it assigned to the several parts of nature, which I could not solve by  the foregoing principles, yet this objection could be of small weight  against the truth and certainty of those things which may be proved a  priori, with the utmost evidence and rigor of demonstration. Secondly,  but neither are the received principles free from the like difficulties;  for, it may still be demanded to what end God should take those  roundabout methods of effecting things by instruments and machines, which  no one can deny might have been effected by the mere command of His will  without all that apparatus; nay, if we narrowly consider it, we shall  find the objection may be retorted with greater force on those who hold  the existence of those machines without of mind; for it has been made  evident that solidity, bulk, figure, motion, and the like have no  activity or efficacy in them, so as to be capable of producing any one  effect in nature. See sect. 25. Whoever therefore supposes them to exist  (allowing the supposition possible) when they are not perceived does it  manifestly to no purpose; since the only use that is"]]]
