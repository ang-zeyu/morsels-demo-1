[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#11)"],[1," thought, and  I never ceased thinking and planning for one moment, that the affair  looked very serious for me, when I saw the cacique approach with my  pistol in hand, exclaiming, \"Now, gringo, thou shalt die, on the altar  of the god, at the sacred shrine of Aztlan, I shall lay thy quivering  heart!\" In vain I looked for help from my companion, who had sought  safety in flight. Something had to be done and that quickly. Surely I  had one trusty friend, true as steel, who would not forsake me in the  extremity of my peril. I bethought me of my little \"American bulldog\"  which I had picked up in the cars in Kansas, and which had ever since  followed me faithfully. \"Sic-semper-Cerberus-Sic!\" My right hand stole  to my hip, a short sharp bark, and the treacherous cacique fell over  with a crimson stain on his forehead. At the same moment a weird,  uncanny yelp pierced the night, and a tremendous shaggy phantom cloud  obscured the slender sickle of the moon. Terrified, the Indians  screamed \"El Perro! El Perro de la Malinche!\" and shrilly the voices of  frightened squaws took up the refrain, \"Perro! Perro! Gringo Perro!\"    When I staggered to my feet, I was alone, sorely bruised and wounded,  but master of the field. I recovered my revolver, which lay at my feet  and contrived to mount my horse, whose bridle had caught on the  greasewood brush, and I headed for home.    Not long thereafter I met my friend Reyes, who was followed by a  retinue of peons. \"Gracias a Dios. Amigo!\" he exclaimed, on seeing me.  \"I came after your body, if it were to be found, and here you are  alive. When I heard the report of firearms and knowing that those  devils had your weapon, I feared the worst. How on earth did you manage  to escape them? Seeing you down and beset by the whole tribe, I gave  you up for dead and fled.\"    I told my friend that with God's help and the phantom dog's assistance  I had beaten off my assailants, and I thought that the cacique had been  sorely bitten by the dog. Dona Josefita was very anxious and excited.  When she saw me coming, she cried, \"The saints preserve us, oh here he  is! Mercy, how he looks, pobrecito! he is cut all to pieces. Hurry,  Reyes, bring him in here and lay him gently down. Hombre, husband,  coward! how couldst thou abandon thy friend who fought for thy honor,  not fearing the death. I wager that pale hussy, Jtz-Li-Cama, was, as  usual, the cause of this strife between men!\"    The kind lady then attended deftly and skillfully to the dressing of my  wounds, applying soothing herbs and healing ointments, which tended to  allay the fever, and she nursed me with the tenderest care, so that in  a week's time I was as well as ever, though not without a feeling of  regret for my too speedy recovery.    Of course, there arose the rumor of a fierce battle between Americans  and Indians. To silence this silly talk and to avoid unpleasant  complications, I surrendered myself to the alcalde of the precinct and  accused myself of having disturbed the peace of the realm. Pleading my  case, I stated that as there was nobody but the peace disturbers  involved, and as said parties did not make any further claim upon the  Honorable Court, therefore, under the statute of the Territory and the  Constitution of the United States, the law required that the court  mulct the guilty parties in the payment of a nominal fine and discharge  the culprits. The Honorable Court decreed that I as an American ought  to know the American law best, and discharged me after I paid my  self-imposed fine. The administering of justice in cases of importance  was, of course, relegated to the United States Circuit Courts, but  Uncle Sam did not care to meddle with the many troublesome alcaldes or  justices of the peace, as he did not understand the Spanish language  very well. This was certainly humiliating and embarrassing, but who can  blame him, as no one is over anxious to be rated an ignorant person.    My Mexican friends decided to give a farewell party in my honor.  Accordingly they made great preparations. They secured the largest  sala, or hall, in the township and scoured the country for  musicians--fiddlers and guitar players. Every person of any social  notability was invited. They drew the line of social respectability at  peons, or bondmen. This was a happy-go-lucky caste of people who  possessed no property nor anything else, and consequently they had no  cares and were under no responsibility of any kind, as the wealthier  classes, who virtually owned them, had to provide for their  necessities. The system of peonage in New Mexico had been abolished  with the abolition of slavery in the United States, but the peons did  not realize the wretchedness of their deplorable social status, and in  their ignorance they regarded their bondage as a privilege, believing  themselves fortunate to have their wants provided for by their  patrones. They were treated kindly by their masters and looked upon as  poor relations and intimate but humble friends.    The entertainment was to be of the velorio (wake) type, which begins as  a prayer meeting and ends in a dance. My friends exerted themselves to  the utmost to make this event the social climax of the season. They  sent a committee to the pueblo of Isleta for several goatskins full of  native wine, and incidentally they borrowed San Augustin, the pueblo's  famous image saint, who they intended should preside over the velorio.  As this prayer meeting was to be in my honor and for the sake of  invoking the protection of the saints on my journey, they thought it  best to procure San Augustin, who being the patron saint of the heathen  Isleta Indians, would not mind giving a heretic Protestant gringo a  good send-off, as he was accustomed to deal with heresy. They also  procured a dozen fat mutton sheep, which were to be barbecued and  served with chile pelado to the invited guests, surely a tempting menu  and hot! The ladies baked bollos, tamales and frijoles. Melons and  cantaloupes were brought in by the cartload. I was waited upon by a  committee and received a formal invitation; for everything was done in  grand Spanish style. When I arrived at the festive hall the ceremonies  began. The ladies knelt before San Augustin, praying and chanting  alternately. I took my customary station at the door, as master of the  artillery. At the singing of a certain stanza and after the words,  \"Angeles, y Seraphim es! Santo! Santo! Santo!\" I received my cue from  one of the deacons who gave the order: \"Fuego, maestro!\" and I  discharged my double barreled shotgun and a brace of six shooters in  lightning-like succession. Surely this was pious devotion, properly  emphasized, and it kept San Augustin from falling asleep. I used up a  pound of gunpowder that night, and this was said to have been the  grandest, most successful velorio ever held in that part of the world.  At eleven o'clock I announced that my battery was overheated and too  dangerous to reload, which stopped the praying and the grand baile  began. There were several hundred dancing couples, who enjoyed  themselves to the utmost until sunrise, and nobody thought of leaving  for home until everything eatable and liquid was disposed of.    Now the date of our departure had arrived, and very sad, indeed, was I  to leave these people who had done their very best to make me feel at  home with them and who seemed to be really fond of me. I consoled Dona  Josefita somewhat with the promise that I would return some day and  find her the treasure of La Gran Quivira. Don Juan Mestal, the  freighter, seemed as reluctant to leave as I was; something was always  turning up to delay our start. But at last we were off.    After three days of travel, we came to a small town, where I met a  Mexican whom I knew on the Rio Grande, where he had formerly lived. He  invited me cordially to the wedding of his sister, which was to be on  the next day at old Fort Wingate, an abandoned fort, and then a Mexican  settlement. This man said that he had come on purpose to meet me, as he  had heard of my intentions to leave the country. Although I did not  like the man, who was said to be jealous of Americans, I accepted his  urgent invitation more from curiosity to learn what he meant to do than  for other reasons.    The next morning I started early from camp and rode over to the little  town, distant fifteen miles. When I arrived in front of my prospective  host's house I caught a glimpse of two men, who were sneaking off  toward an old corral. Then I knew what was in the wind, for those two  men were known to me as desperate cutthroat thieves and highwaymen;  their specialty was to waylay and murder American travelers. My kind  friend professed to be overmuch delighted at my arrival. He took charge  of my horse and invited me into his house, where I met the bridal  couple and their friends, who were carousing and gambling. I joined and  made merry with them. At ten o'clock the whole party made ready to  proceed to the chapel, where the marriage ceremony was to be performed.  I simulated the part of a very inebriated person, a condition which  they looked forward to with hope and satisfaction, and told them that I  would stay at the house to await their return. When everybody had left  I thought I might as well get under way, feeling lonesome. I went out  and around to the rear of the house, where the corral was, to get my  horse, but found the gate fastened with chains and securely locked. The  corral walls were built of adobe, and the two walls of it were a  continuation of the side walls of the house, and its end wall formed an  enclosure or backyard. My horse was there, and I found my saddle in one  of the rooms of the building, hidden under a blanket. I entered the  corral through the back door of the house, caught and saddled my horse,  and then led him out to the street. This was a very laughable manner of  leave-taking. The house was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43008"],[0,"Around the Yule Log (#11)"],[1,"    And ceremony doffed his pride;      All hailed with uncontrolled delight      And general voice the happy night      That to the cottage, as the crown,      Brought tidings of salvation down.        England was merry England, when      Old Christmas brought his sports again.      'Twas Christmas broached the mightiest ale;      'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;      A Christmas gambol oft could cheer      The poor man's heart through half the year.    Of all the supernatural visitors who roused old Scrooge from his  slumbers in Dickens' immortal \"Carol,\" by far the most interesting was  the Ghost of Christmas Present. The Past is a memory; the Future a  dream; the Present is ours. With its ghost--or its spirit, to free  ourselves from uncanny associations with the name--we are intimately  associated: it is the key-note, or rather the theme, which determines  the harmony or discord of the year.    What, then, is the spirit of our own Christmas Present? what the  underlying motive and thought, the impulse that turns our population  out of their comfortable homes in the snowy streets during the most  inclement month of our New England year, and then as universally  gathers each family circle within doors on that one supreme Day of  days? which decks counter, wall, window, and altar with evergreen,  type of Eternal Life; which loosens the purse-strings of rich and  poor; which brings the name of Christ tenderly to the lips of young  and old? With all this we have much to do. Here it is, the spirit of  Christmas, analyzable or not, for good or for evil.    There is much outcry nowadays against the extravagant mysticism which  pervades the observance of the day. Christmas cards have run wild with  grotesque fancies. Christmas games, legends, stories, plays,--even the  columns of the daily press are full of them. At this season, the  compositor may keep standing the words \"Christmas,\" \"Bethlehem,\"  \"Christ,\" so often are they called into service.    There is the mysticism, the revival of the ancient myth and  folk-belief; and there is the rush of \"the trade\" for the pecuniary  advantages of the public tender-heartedness. One man gazes at the Star  until he stumbles in the highway: his neighbor stands at the gates of  Bethlehem on Christmas morning and takes toll. These are the extremes,  never more marked, more obtrusive, than in this year of our Lord 1898.    But between the two, hurrying over the fields toward the city by the  light of the Star, and thronging through the gates toward the little  manger throne, are the vast numbers of honest, earnest, sincere men  and women who find at Christmastide their perplexed lives made clear,  their hopes brightened, their burdens lightened, their strength  renewed for the twelvemonth to come.    To the mysticism, the love for glorified myth and legend, that  characterizes the Spirit of Christmas Present, they find an answering  chord in their own hearts, which will not be satisfied with shallow  interpretations of the day; which demands something deeper, and cannot  rest content with the broken clause, \"On earth peace, good will toward  men,\" but must echo the wonderful song that rang out over the dark  hill-slopes of Judaea, \"Glory to God in the highest.\"    As we gather about the cradle of every wee human child, born by such  wondrous miracle, so on each Christmas Eve the world gathers at the  rude manger where its Baby is laid, gazing into the gentle, radiant  face, and whispering, \"There is born this day a Saviour, which is  Christ the Lord!\"    \"Mysticism,\"--life is clothed in mystery! The birth of the poorest,  meanest child, in the shabbiest attic of your street of ill repute, is  a mystery far too sacred for man to divine. How shall we smile at  those who find in Christmas the consummate Mystery, the holiest  miracle that the weary, wondering earth has known?    The holiest, the deepest, and yet the simplest! For Christmas Day is  pre-eminently a day for entering the kingdom as a child. The door of  the stable is low; and we must stoop as we enter hand in hand with  little folk,--so sweet, so humble, so dear to everyday, plain  home-living is this Christian season of merrymaking.    The august features of the wise astrologers of the East relax, as they  turn from the Star to the face of the Child. The tax-gatherer forgets  his calling, and at last joins the throng of Christmas joy-makers and  joy-receivers, who find kindly impersonation in \"Santa Claus.\"    Let the card-dealers, then, and the writers of pretty fancies--the  students of folk-lore, the devotees of mystic rite--have their way;  let the tradesman prosper in the time of gift-giving; and every toiler  in the wide business field reap his golden harvest or glean his few  sheaves, as he may. We will not cast out from the Spirit of Christmas  Present its solemnity, its prosperity, its simple and innocent gayety.  There is no danger at present that Christmas shall be too much  observed in America: there is only the danger that its good cheer and  deeper thought, its impulse of benevolence and good will toward men,  shall be confined to a few days or weeks of the year.    Extremes of enthusiasm will ripen into earnest living. It is  narrowness and coldness, the mere humanitarian spirit of good morals,  the sneer at Christmas sentiment, that are to be dreaded. It is the  spirit of \"Christmas all the year round\" that is to be prayed for.          VII    MRS. BROWNLOW'S CHRISTMAS PARTY      It was fine Christmas weather. Several light snow-storms in the early  part of December had left the earth fair and white, and the sparkling,  cold days that followed were enough to make the most crabbed and  morose of mankind cheerful, as with a foretaste of the joyous season  at hand. Down town the sidewalks were crowded with mothers and  sisters, buying gifts for their sons, brothers, and husbands, who  found it impossible to get anywhere by taking the ordinary course of  foot-travel, and were obliged to stalk along the snowy streets beside  the curbstone, in a sober but not ill-humored row.    Among those who were looking forward to the holidays with keen  anticipations of pleasure, were Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow, of Elm Street,  Boston. They had quietly talked the matter over together, and decided  that, as there were three children in the family (not counting  themselves, as they might well have done), it would be a delightful  and not too expensive luxury to give a little Christmas party.    \"You see, John,\" said Mrs. Brownlow, \"we've been asked, ourselves, to  half a dozen candy-pulls and parties since we've lived here, and it  seems nothin' but fair that we should do it once ourselves.\"    \"That's so, Clarissy,\" replied her husband slowly; \"but then--there's  so many of us, and my salary's--well, it would cost considerable,  little woman, wouldn't it?\"    \"I'll tell you what!\" she exclaimed. \"We needn't have a regular  grown-up party, but just one for children. We can get a small tree,  and a bit of a present for each of the boys and girls, with ice-cream  and cake, and let it go at that. The whole thing sha'n't cost ten  dollars.\"    \"Good!\" said Mr. Brownlow heartily. \"I knew you'd get some way out of  it. Let's tell Bob and Sue and Polly, so they can have the fun of  looking forward to it.\"    So it was settled and all hands entered into the plan with such a  degree of earnestness that one would have thought these people were  going to have some grand gift themselves, instead of giving to others,  and pinching for a month afterwards, in their own comforts, as they  knew they would have to do.    The first real difficulty they met was in deciding whom to invite.  John was for asking only the children of their immediate neighbors;  but Mrs. Brownlow said it would be a kindness, as well as polite, to  include those who were better off than themselves.    \"I allus think, John,\" she explained, laying her hand on his shoulder,  \"that it's just's much despisin' to look down on your rich  neighbors--as if all they'd got was money--as on your poor ones. Let's  ask 'em all: Deacon Holsum's, the Brights, and the Nortons.\" The  Brights were Mr. Brownlow's employers.    \"Anybody else?\" queried her husband, with his funny twinkle. \"P'raps  you'd like to have me ask the governor's family, or Jordan & Marsh!\"    \"Now, John, don't you be saucy,\" she laughed, relieved at having  carried her point. \"Let's put our heads together, and see who to set  down. Susie will write the notes in her nice hand, and Bob can deliver  them, to save postage.\"    \"Well, you've said three,\" counted Mr. Brownlow on his fingers. \"Then  there's Mrs. Sampson's little girl, and the four Williamses, and\"--he  enumerated one family after another, till nearly thirty names were on  the list.    Once Susie broke in, \"O Pa, _don't_ invite that Mary Spenfield; she's  awfully stuck-up and cross!\"    \"Good!\" said her father again. \"This will be just the thing for her.  Let her be coffee and you be sugar, and see how much you can sweeten  her that evening.\"    In the few days that intervened before the twenty-fifth, the whole  family were busy enough, Mrs. Brownlow shopping, Susie writing the  notes, and the others helping wherever they got a chance. Every  evening they spread out upon the sitting-room floor such presents as  had been bought during the day. These were not costly, but they were  chosen lovingly, and seemed very nice indeed to Mr. Brownlow and the  children, who united in praising the discriminating taste of Mrs. B.,  as with justifiable pride she sat in the center of the room, bringing  forth her purchases from the depths of a capacious carpetbag.    The grand final expenditure was left until the day before Christmas.  Mr. Brownlow got off from his work early, with his month's salary in  his pocket, and a few kind words from his employers tucked away even  more securely in his warm heart. He had taken special pains to include  their children for "]]]
