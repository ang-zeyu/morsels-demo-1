On a tag, or the paper on which the address is written, the  sender of third class matter may write \"from\" and add his own name  and address.  2. On the blank leaf of a book, forwarded as third class matter,  the sender may write a dedication or inscription, but it must not  be in the form of a letter.  3. Fourth class matter must be so wrapped that the postal  authorities can examine the contents without much trouble.  4. Such articles as glass, nails, needles or other matter that  might work injury if it came loose, must be enclosed in two  separate wrappings, or a double case.  5. Poisons, explosives, inflammable substances, and live animals  are excluded from the mails.  6. Firearms may only be sent in detached parts.  7. All alcoholic liquors are regarded as explosive.    FOREIGN RATES    The rates to Canada are the same for all classes of matter as in  the United States, except that seeds, scions, bulbs, cuttings, and  roots are one cent per ounce.    To Cuba all the rates are the same as for domestic matter.    Rates with Mexico are the same as if mailed between our own  states. Packages are limited to 4 pounds 6 ounces, except that  single books may weigh more. Merchandise must be sent by parcel  post.    To all other countries, in what is known as the \"Postal Union\",  the rates for letters are five cents for each half ounce or  fraction thereof.    Postal cards two cents each, double four cents.    Registration fees or letters or other articles, four cents each.    Ordinary letters for foreign countries, except Canada, Cuba and  Mexico, must be forwarded, whether any postage is paid on them or  not.    All other mailable matter must be prepaid.    Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Tetuila, the Philippines and Porto Rico are  regarded as insular or territorial possessions of the United  States, and are entitled to the same postal rates.    STAMPS    Postage stamps may be purchased at any United States post office,  or at any place authorized to sell them.    Anyone may sell postage stamps as he would any other personal  asset.    If stamps are bought to be enclosed in a letter, they should never  be of a higher denomination than twos and ones, as they are easily  disposed of.    Letters should always be stamped on the upper right-hand corner of  the envelope.    Packages should be stamped in the same way and on the addressed  side.    The using of cancelled stamps is a felony.    Foreign stamps have no value on letters or parcels mailed in the  United States.    A domestic, unstamped letter will not be forwarded.    If a stamped letter is found to require more postage, the amount  lacking is stamped on the letter, and must be paid by the  receiver.    Stamped envelopes and stamped wrappers are sold by the post office  at the usual rates of postage, with the cost of the paper added.    If a stamped envelope or wrapper is spoiled, the stamp must not be  cut off and used by pasting on another envelope or wrapper, for it  will be treated as if no postage were paid.    Such spoiled wrappers or envelopes will be exchanged, without  charge, by the postmaster, for stamps of the same value.    POSTAL CARDS    Never use a postal card to dun a debtor.    Never send a confidential message on a postal card.    Foreign postal cards, that is those bearing a foreign stamp,  cannot be used in the United States.    An international postal card can be bought.    Postal cards and letters may be redirected and forwarded without  extra charge, where the address of the receiver has been changed.  Packages require a renewal of payment in such cases.    REGISTERING LETTERS    A letter or a parcel may be registered to further insure its safe  delivery.    When a letter or parcel is registered, it must have the sender's  name and address written across the left-hand end of the envelope  and on the reverse side.    In addition to the stamps required ordinarily, eight cents in  stamps or in a regularly prepared stamp, is the registration fee.    The clerk, receiving a registered parcel, gives the sender a  receipt for the same. After the letter has reached its  destination, the sender gets a second receipt, through the post  office, signed with the receiver's name.    The receiver of a registered parcel signs two receipts, one for  the post office and the other for the sender.    SPECIAL DELIVERY    The purpose of what is known, in connection with the post office,  as the \"Special Delivery System\", is to insure the delivery of any  letter or package to the person, to whom it is addressed, as soon  as it reaches his post office.    In addition to the regular post charge, a fee of 10 cents is added  for special delivery. This is in the form of a special stamp,  though when this cannot be had, the same amount in ordinary stamps  may be attached.    In the case noted, the sender should write in line with the  stamps, \"special delivery.\"    Special delivery messages are delivered, not by ordinary carriers,  but by special delivery messengers.    The special delivery letter is used when immediate knowledge is  necessary. It saves a long telegram.    MONEY ORDERS    Money, in limited sums, may be sent through the post office. One  advantage of sending money in this way is that it practically  insures the sender against loss.    All post offices are not money order offices.    A post office money order may only be sent to those places where  there are such offices.    At all post offices, authorized to send money orders, proper  blanks can be had on which the sender can write his order.    Any sum may be sent by postal order, from one cent to one hundred  dollars.    The fee is from three to thirty cents.    Read the blank carefully; it is simple, but be sure you understand  it before filling out the order.    If in doubt, ask the clerk.    Having filled out the order, hand it to the clerk with the sum  required, and the additional fee.    The clerk then prepares and hands out an order for the amount, on  the postmaster of the town to which you are sending your letter,  and this you enclose to your correspondent.    CASHING POST OFFICE ORDERS    The money order never contains the name of the sender; this the  postmaster of the office from which it is sent supplies in a  separate communication to the postmaster who is to pay.    No money passes from one office to the other.    A post office order is like a draft drawn by one postmaster on  another. The one credits the sum, the other debits it.    The holder of an order will not get his money unless he is known  to the paying postmaster or is identified.    Before paying an order the postmaster requires the holder to  receipt it.    A post office money order, like a check or draft, may be  transferred to another for collection.    Banks receive transferred money orders as if they were cash  deposits.    The party to whom orders are transferred must go through the same  forms at the office, where payment is made, as if he was the  original payee.    ADVICE    It is not necessary to register letters containing checks. Never  write \"personal\" on a business letter.    Always enclose a stamp for reply when writing to a stranger.    See that the addresses on your letters are distinctly legible.          CHAPTER XIV    TELEGRAMS--THE TELEPHONE        To send a telegram, you or your messenger must take what you have  written to the nearest telegraph office.    You may write a telegram on any kind of paper, provided always  that the writing is plain.    All telegraph offices are provided with regular blank forms, which  may be had without cost, and it is better to use these when they  are available.    The blank is properly ruled, with lines for the date, for the  address of the one to whom it is to be sent, and for the message.    CHARGES    The telegraph company charges a fixed sum for a message of, say,  ten words. These words do not include the name and address of the  sender.    The amount of the charge is always dependent on the distance  between the office from which the message is sent and the one at  which it is received.    Every word over ten, in the message, pays an extra fee, dependent  again on the distance.    Getting just what you mean into ten words may seem difficult when  you have a lot to say, but it is surprising how you can boil the  message down when each additional word costs five or more cents.    It may pay to practice this.    If it is actually necessary to make your meaning clear by the  addition of more words, do not hesitate at the cost.    If you are known at the telegraph office, you can send a message  to be collected from the receiver.    Never permit the receiver to pay for a message that is exclusively  on your own business.    Always make and keep a copy of every important telegram you send  away. Do not neglect this.    If you have neglected to keep a copy of a telegram, or having made  one have lost it, you may get a copy from the telegraph office,  provided the application be made within six months of the sending  of the message.    Telegrams are delivered by the company's messengers.    You must give receipt to the messenger on the delivery of a  telegram.    Where the receiver lives a long distance from the telegraph  office, it is customary to pay the messenger an additional fee,  depending on the distance.    The charges for telegrams to be sent at night and delivered in the  morning, are much lower than for day messages.    For an additional charge, less than the original, messages may be  repeated back to insure their accuracy.    Read over to the official, or still better, have him read your  message over in your presence, that you may be sure he understands  it as written.    You cannot hold others responsible for your own mistakes.    TELEGRAPHING MONEY    You can telegraph money with as much safety as you can send it  through a bank.    In handling money in this way, the telegraph company does not act  as a banker but as a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6168"],[0,"Fifty Famous People: A Book of Short Stories (#11)"],[1," their errand, his face darkened, and he shook his head.    For a long time his mother pleaded with him. For a long time his wife  begged him to be merciful. His little children clung to his knees and  spoke loving words to him.    At last, he could hold out no longer. \"O mother,\" he said, \"you have  saved your country, but have lost your son!\" Then he commanded his  army to march back to the city of Antium.    [Illustration]    Rome was saved; but Coriolanus could never return to his home, his  mother, his wife and children. He was lost to them.          SAVED BY A DOLPHIN        In the city of Corinth [Footnote: Cor'inth.] there once lived a  wonderful musician whose name was Arion. [Footnote: A r_i_'on.] No  other person could play on the lyre or sing so sweetly as he; and  the songs which he composed were famous in many lands.    The king of Corinth was his friend. The people of Corinth never grew  tired of praising his sweet music.    One summer he went over the sea to Italy; for his name was well known  there, and many people wished to hear him sing.    He visited several cities, and in each place he was well paid for his  music.    At last, having become quite rich, he decided to go home. There was  a ship just ready to sail for Corinth, and the captain agreed to take  him as a passenger.    The sea was rough. The ship was driven far out of her course. Many  days passed before they came in sight of land.    The sailors were rude and unruly. The captain himself had been a  robber.    When they heard that Arion had a large sum of money with him they began  to make plans to get it.    \"The easiest way,\" said the captain, \"is to throw him overboard. Then  there will be no one to tell tales.\"    Arion overheard them plotting.    \"You may take everything that I have,\" he said, \"if you will only spare  my life.\"    But they had made up their minds to get rid of him. They feared to  spare him lest he should report the matter to the king.    \"Your life we will not spare,\" they said; \"but we will give you the  choice of two things. You must either jump overboard into the sea or  be slain with your own sword. Which shall it be?\"    \"I shall jump overboard,\" said Arion, \"but I pray that you will first  grant me a favor.\"    \"What is it?\" asked the captain.    \"Allow me to sing to you my latest and best song. I promise that as  soon as it is finished I will leap into the sea.\"    The sailors agreed; for they were anxious to hear the musician whose  songs were famous all over the world.    [Illustration]    Arion dressed himself in his finest clothing. He took his stand on the  forward deck, while the robber sailors stood in a half circle before  him, anxious to listen to his song.    He touched his lyre and began to play the accompaniment. Then he sang  a wonderful song, so sweet, so lively, so touching, that many of the  sailors were moved to tears.    And now they would have spared him; but he was true to his promise,--  as soon as the song was finished, he threw himself headlong into the  sea.    The sailors divided his money among themselves; and the ship sailed  on. In a short time they reached Corinth in safety, and the king sent  an officer to bring the captain and his men to the palace.    \"Are you lately from Italy?\" he asked.    \"We are,\" they answered.    \"What news can you give me concerning my friend Arion, the sweetest  of all musicians?\"    \"He was well and happy when we left Italy,\" they answered. \"He has  a mind to spend the rest of his life in that country.\"    Hardly had they spoken these words when the door opened and Arion  himself stood before them. He was dressed just as they had seen him  when he jumped into the sea. They were so astonished that they fell  upon their knees before the king and confessed their crime.    Now, how was Arion saved from drowning when he leaped overboard?    Old story-tellers say that he alighted on the back of a large fish,  called a dolphin, which had been charmed by his music and was swimming  near the ship. The dolphin carried him with great speed to the nearest  shore. Then, full of joy, the musician hastened to Corinth, not  stopping even to change his dress.    He told his wonderful story to the king; but the king would not believe  him.    \"Wait,\" said he, \"till the ship arrives, and then we shall know the  truth.\" Three hours later, the ship came into port, as you have already  learned. Other people think that the dolphin which saved Arion was not  a fish, but a ship named the _Dolphin_. They say that Arion, being a  good swimmer, kept himself afloat until this ship happened to pass by  and rescued him from the waves.    You may believe the story that you like best. The name of Arion is  still remembered as that of a most wonderful musician.        \"LITTLE BROTHERS OF THE AIR\"    The man of whom I am now going to tell you was famous, not for his  wealth or his power or his deeds in war, but for his great gentleness.  He lived more than seven hundred years ago in a quaint little town of  Italy. His name was Francis, and because of his goodness, all men now  call him St. Francis.    [Illustration]    Very kind and loving was St. Francis--kind and loving not only to men  but to all living things. He spoke of the birds as his little brothers  of the air, and he could never bear to see them harmed.    At Christmas time he scattered crumbs of bread under the trees, so  that the tiny creatures could feast and be happy.    Once when a boy gave him a pair of doves which he had snared, St.  Francis had a nest made for them, and the mother bird laid her eggs  in it.    By and by, the eggs hatched, and a nestful of young doves grew up.  They were so tame that they sat on the shoulders of St. Francis and  ate from his hand.    And many other stories are told of this man's great love and pity for  the timid creatures which lived in the fields and woods.    One day as he was walking among the trees the birds saw him and flew  down to greet him. They sang their sweetest songs to show how much  they loved him. Then, when they saw that he was about to speak, they  nestled softly in the grass and listened.    \"O little birds,\" he said, \"I love you, for you are my brothers and  sisters of the air. Let me tell you something, my little brothers, my  little sisters: You ought always to love God and praise Him.    \"For think what He has given you. He has given you wings with which  to fly through the air. He has given you clothing both warm and  beautiful. He has given you the air in which to move and have homes.    \"And think of this, O little brothers: you sow not, neither do you  reap, for God feeds you. He gives you the rivers and the brooks from  which to drink. He gives you the mountains and the valleys where you  may rest. He gives you the trees in which to build your nests.    \"You toil not, neither do you spin, yet God takes care of you and your  little ones. It must be, then, that He loves you. So, do not be  ungrateful, but sing His praises and thank Him for his goodness toward  you.\"    Then the saint stopped speaking and looked around him. All the birds  sprang up joyfully. They spread their wings and opened their mouths  to show that they understood his words.    And when he had blessed them, all began to sing; and the whole forest  was filled with sweetness and joy because of their wonderful melodies.          A CLEVER SLAVE    A long time ago there lived a poor slave whose name was Aesop.  [Footnote: Aesop (_pro_. e'sop).] He was a small man with a large  head and long arms. His face was white, but very homely. His large  eyes were bright and snappy.    When Aesop was about twenty years old his master lost a great deal of  money and was obliged to sell his slaves. To do this, he had to take  them to a large city where there was a slave market.    The city was far away, and the slaves must walk the whole distance.  A number of bundles were made up for them to carry. Some of these  bundles contained the things they would need on the road; some  contained clothing; and some contained goods which the master would  sell in the city.    \"Choose your bundles, boys,\" said the master. \"There is one for each  of you.\"    Aesop at once chose the largest one. The other slaves laughed and said  he was foolish. But he threw it upon his shoulders and seemed well  satisfied. The next day, the laugh was the other way. For the bundle  which he had chosen had contained the food for the whole party. After  all had eaten three meals from it, it was very much lighter. And before  the end of the journey Aesop had nothing to carry, while the other  slaves were groaning under their heavy loads.    \"Aesop is a wise fellow,\" said his master. \"The man who buys him must  pay a high price.\"    A very rich man, whose name was Xanthus, [Footnote: Xanthus (_pro_.  zan'thus).] came to the slave market to buy a servant. As the slaves  stood before him he asked each one to tell what kind of work he could  do. All were eager to be bought by Xanthus because they knew he would  be a kind master. So each one boasted of his skill in doing some sort  of labor. One was a fine gardener; another could take care of horses; a  third was a good cook; a fourth could manage a household.    \"And what can you do, Aesop?\" asked Xanthus.    \"Nothing,\" he answered.    \"Nothing? How is that?\"    \"Because, since these other slaves do everything, there is nothing  left for me to perform,\" said Aesop.    This answer pleased the rich man so well that he bought Aesop at once,  and took him to his home on the island of Samos.    In Samos the little slave soon became known for his wisdom and courage.  He often amused his master and his master's friends by telling droll  fables about birds and beasts that could talk. They saw that all these  fables taught some great truth, and they wondered how Aesop could have  thought of them.    Many other stories are told of this wonderful slave. His master was  so much pleased with him"]]]
