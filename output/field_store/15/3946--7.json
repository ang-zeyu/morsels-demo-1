And then she was dragged out of my  sight into the depths of the deserted edifice.          CHAPTER IX    I LEARN THE LANGUAGE      As I came back to myself I glanced at Sola, who had witnessed this  encounter and I was surprised to note a strange expression upon her  usually expressionless countenance.  What her thoughts were I did not  know, for as yet I had learned but little of the Martian tongue; enough  only to suffice for my daily needs.    As I reached the doorway of our building a strange surprise awaited me.  A warrior approached bearing the arms, ornaments, and full  accouterments of his kind.  These he presented to me with a few  unintelligible words, and a bearing at once respectful and menacing.    Later, Sola, with the aid of several of the other women, remodeled the  trappings to fit my lesser proportions, and after they completed the  work I went about garbed in all the panoply of war.    From then on Sola instructed me in the mysteries of the various  weapons, and with the Martian young I spent several hours each day  practicing upon the plaza.  I was not yet proficient with all the  weapons, but my great familiarity with similar earthly weapons made me  an unusually apt pupil, and I progressed in a very satisfactory manner.    The training of myself and the young Martians was conducted solely by  the women, who not only attend to the education of the young in the  arts of individual defense and offense, but are also the artisans who  produce every manufactured article wrought by the green Martians.  They  make the powder, the cartridges, the firearms; in fact everything of  value is produced by the females.  In time of actual warfare they form  a part of the reserves, and when the necessity arises fight with even  greater intelligence and ferocity than the men.    The men are trained in the higher branches of the art of war; in  strategy and the maneuvering of large bodies of troops.  They make the  laws as they are needed; a new law for each emergency.  They are  unfettered by precedent in the administration of justice.  Customs have  been handed down by ages of repetition, but the punishment for ignoring  a custom is a matter for individual treatment by a jury of the  culprit's peers, and I may say that justice seldom misses fire, but  seems rather to rule in inverse ratio to the ascendency of law.  In one  respect at least the Martians are a happy people; they have no lawyers.    I did not see the prisoner again for several days subsequent to our  first encounter, and then only to catch a fleeting glimpse of her as  she was being conducted to the great audience chamber where I had had  my first meeting with Lorquas Ptomel.  I could not but note the  unnecessary harshness and brutality with which her guards treated her;  so different from the almost maternal kindliness which Sola manifested  toward me, and the respectful attitude of the few green Martians who  took the trouble to notice me at all.    I had observed on the two occasions when I had seen her that the  prisoner exchanged words with her guards, and this convinced me that  they spoke, or at least could make themselves understood by a common  language.  With this added incentive I nearly drove Sola distracted by  my importunities to hasten on my education and within a few more days I  had mastered the Martian tongue sufficiently well to enable me to carry  on a passable conversation and to fully understand practically all that  I heard.    At this time our sleeping quarters were occupied by three or four  females and a couple of the recently hatched young, beside Sola and her  youthful ward, myself, and Woola the hound.  After they had retired for  the night it was customary for the adults to carry on a desultory  conversation for a short time before lapsing into sleep, and now that I  could understand their language I was always a keen listener, although  I never proffered any remarks myself.    On the night following the prisoner's visit to the audience chamber the  conversation finally fell upon this subject, and I was all ears on the  instant.  I had feared to question Sola relative to the beautiful  captive, as I could not but recall the strange expression I had noted  upon her face after my first encounter with the prisoner.  That it  denoted jealousy I could not say, and yet, judging all things by  mundane standards as I still did, I felt it safer to affect  indifference in the matter until I learned more surely Sola's attitude  toward the object of my solicitude.    Sarkoja, one of the older women who shared our domicile, had been  present at the audience as one of the captive's guards, and it was  toward her the question turned.    \"When,\" asked one of the women, \"will we enjoy the death throes of the  red one? or does Lorquas Ptomel, Jed, intend holding her for ransom?\"    \"They have decided to carry her with us back to Thark, and exhibit her  last agonies at the great games before Tal Hajus,\" replied Sarkoja.    \"What will be the manner of her going out?\" inquired Sola.  \"She is  very small and very beautiful; I had hoped that they would hold her for  ransom.\"    Sarkoja and the other women grunted angrily at this evidence of  weakness on the part of Sola.    \"It is sad, Sola, that you were not born a million years ago,\" snapped  Sarkoja, \"when all the hollows of the land were filled with water, and  the peoples were as soft as the stuff they sailed upon.  In our day we  have progressed to a point where such sentiments mark weakness and  atavism.  It will not be well for you to permit Tars Tarkas to learn  that you hold such degenerate sentiments, as I doubt that he would care  to entrust such as you with the grave responsibilities of maternity.\"    \"I see nothing wrong with my expression of interest in this red woman,\"  retorted Sola.  \"She has never harmed us, nor would she should we have  fallen into her hands.  It is only the men of her kind who war upon us,  and I have ever thought that their attitude toward us is but the  reflection of ours toward them.  They live at peace with all their  fellows, except when duty calls upon them to make war, while we are at  peace with none; forever warring among our own kind as well as upon the  red men, and even in our own communities the individuals fight amongst  themselves.  Oh, it is one continual, awful period of bloodshed from  the time we break the shell until we gladly embrace the bosom of the  river of mystery, the dark and ancient Iss which carries us to an  unknown, but at least no more frightful and terrible existence!  Fortunate indeed is he who meets his end in an early death.  Say what  you please to Tars Tarkas, he can mete out no worse fate to me than a  continuation of the horrible existence we are forced to lead in this  life.\"    This wild outbreak on the part of Sola so greatly surprised and shocked  the other women, that, after a few words of general reprimand, they all  lapsed into silence and were soon asleep.  One thing the episode had  accomplished was to assure me of Sola's friendliness toward the poor  girl, and also to convince me that I had been extremely fortunate in  falling into her hands rather than those of some of the other females.  I knew that she was fond of me, and now that I had discovered that she  hated cruelty and barbarity I was confident that I could depend upon  her to aid me and the girl captive to escape, provided of course that  such a thing was within the range of possibilities.    I did not even know that there were any better conditions to escape to,  but I was more than willing to take my chances among people fashioned  after my own mold rather than to remain longer among the hideous and  bloodthirsty green men of Mars.  But where to go, and how, was as much  of a puzzle to me as the age-old search for the spring of eternal life  has been to earthly men since the beginning of time.    I decided that at the first opportunity I would take Sola into my  confidence and openly ask her to aid me, and with this resolution  strong upon me I turned among my silks and furs and slept the dreamless  and refreshing sleep of Mars.          CHAPTER X    CHAMPION AND CHIEF      Early the next morning I was astir.  Considerable freedom was allowed  me, as Sola had informed me that so long as I did not attempt to leave  the city I was free to go and come as I pleased.  She had warned me,  however, against venturing forth unarmed, as this city, like all other  deserted metropolises of an ancient Martian civilization, was peopled  by the great white apes of my second day's adventure.    In advising me that I must not leave the boundaries of the city Sola  had explained that Woola would prevent this anyway should I attempt it,  and she warned me most urgently not to arouse his fierce nature by  ignoring his warnings should I venture too close to the forbidden  territory.  His nature was such, she said, that he would bring me back  into the city dead or alive should I persist in opposing him;  \"preferably dead,\" she added.    On this morning I had chosen a new street to explore when suddenly I  found myself at the limits of the city.  Before me were low hills  pierced by narrow and inviting ravines.  I longed to explore the  country before me, and, like the pioneer stock from which I sprang, to  view what the landscape beyond the encircling hills might disclose from  the summits which shut out my view.    It also occurred to me that this would prove an excellent opportunity  to test the qualities of Woola.  I was convinced that the brute loved  me; I had seen more evidences of affection in him than in any other  Martian animal, man or beast, and I was sure that gratitude for the  acts that had twice saved his life would more than outweigh his loyalty  to the duty imposed upon him by cruel and loveless masters.    As I approached the boundary line Woola ran anxiously "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/624"],[0,"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887 (#11)"],[1,"two hours I walked or ran through the streets of the  city, visiting most quarters of the peninsular part of the town. None  but an antiquarian who knows something of the contrast which the Boston  of today offers to the Boston of the nineteenth century can begin to  appreciate what a series of bewildering surprises I underwent during  that time. Viewed from the house-top the day before, the city had  indeed appeared strange to me, but that was only in its general aspect.  How complete the change had been I first realized now that I walked the  streets. The few old landmarks which still remained only intensified  this effect, for without them I might have imagined myself in a foreign  town. A man may leave his native city in childhood, and return fifty  years later, perhaps, to find it transformed in many features. He is  astonished, but he is not bewildered. He is aware of a great lapse of  time, and of changes likewise occurring in himself meanwhile. He but  dimly recalls the city as he knew it when a child. But remember that  there was no sense of any lapse of time with me. So far as my  consciousness was concerned, it was but yesterday, but a few hours,  since I had walked these streets in which scarcely a feature had  escaped a complete metamorphosis. The mental image of the old city was  so fresh and strong that it did not yield to the impression of the  actual city, but contended with it, so that it was first one and then  the other which seemed the more unreal. There was nothing I saw which  was not blurred in this way, like the faces of a composite photograph.    Finally, I stood again at the door of the house from which I had come  out. My feet must have instinctively brought me back to the site of my  old home, for I had no clear idea of returning thither. It was no more  homelike to me than any other spot in this city of a strange  generation, nor were its inmates less utterly and necessarily strangers  than all the other men and women now on the earth. Had the door of the  house been locked, I should have been reminded by its resistance that I  had no object in entering, and turned away, but it yielded to my hand,  and advancing with uncertain steps through the hall, I entered one of  the apartments opening from it. Throwing myself into a chair, I covered  my burning eyeballs with my hands to shut out the horror of  strangeness. My mental confusion was so intense as to produce actual  nausea. The anguish of those moments, during which my brain seemed  melting, or the abjectness of my sense of helplessness, how can I  describe? In my despair I groaned aloud. I began to feel that unless  some help should come I was about to lose my mind. And just then it did  come. I heard the rustle of drapery, and looked up. Edith Leete was  standing before me. Her beautiful face was full of the most poignant  sympathy.    \"Oh, what is the matter, Mr. West?\" she said. \"I was here when you came  in. I saw how dreadfully distressed you looked, and when I heard you  groan, I could not keep silent. What has happened to you? Where have  you been? Can't I do something for you?\"    Perhaps she involuntarily held out her hands in a gesture of compassion  as she spoke. At any rate I had caught them in my own and was clinging  to them with an impulse as instinctive as that which prompts the  drowning man to seize upon and cling to the rope which is thrown him as  he sinks for the last time. As I looked up into her compassionate face  and her eyes moist with pity, my brain ceased to whirl. The tender  human sympathy which thrilled in the soft pressure of her fingers had  brought me the support I needed. Its effect to calm and soothe was like  that of some wonder-working elixir.    \"God bless you,\" I said, after a few moments. \"He must have sent you to  me just now. I think I was in danger of going crazy if you had not  come.\" At this the tears came into her eyes.    \"Oh, Mr. West!\" she cried. \"How heartless you must have thought us! How  could we leave you to yourself so long! But it is over now, is it not?  You are better, surely.\"    \"Yes,\" I said, \"thanks to you. If you will not go away quite yet, I  shall be myself soon.\"    \"Indeed I will not go away,\" she said, with a little quiver of her  face, more expressive of her sympathy than a volume of words. \"You must  not think us so heartless as we seemed in leaving you so by yourself. I  scarcely slept last night, for thinking how strange your waking would  be this morning; but father said you would sleep till late. He said  that it would be better not to show too much sympathy with you at  first, but to try to divert your thoughts and make you feel that you  were among friends.\"    \"You have indeed made me feel that,\" I answered. \"But you see it is a  good deal of a jolt to drop a hundred years, and although I did not  seem to feel it so much last night, I have had very odd sensations this  morning.\" While I held her hands and kept my eyes on her face, I could  already even jest a little at my plight.    \"No one thought of such a thing as your going out in the city alone so  early in the morning,\" she went on. \"Oh, Mr. West, where have you been?\"    Then I told her of my morning's experience, from my first waking till  the moment I had looked up to see her before me, just as I have told it  here. She was overcome by distressful pity during the recital, and,  though I had released one of her hands, did not try to take from me the  other, seeing, no doubt, how much good it did me to hold it. \"I can  think a little what this feeling must have been like,\" she said. \"It  must have been terrible. And to think you were left alone to struggle  with it! Can you ever forgive us?\"    \"But it is gone now. You have driven it quite away for the present,\" I  said.    \"You will not let it return again,\" she queried anxiously.    \"I can't quite say that,\" I replied. \"It might be too early to say  that, considering how strange everything will still be to me.\"    \"But you will not try to contend with it alone again, at least,\" she  persisted. \"Promise that you will come to us, and let us sympathize  with you, and try to help you. Perhaps we can't do much, but it will  surely be better than to try to bear such feelings alone.\"    \"I will come to you if you will let me,\" I said.    \"Oh yes, yes, I beg you will,\" she said eagerly. \"I would do anything  to help you that I could.\"    \"All you need do is to be sorry for me, as you seem to be now,\" I  replied.    \"It is understood, then,\" she said, smiling with wet eyes, \"that you  are to come and tell me next time, and not run all over Boston among  strangers.\"    This assumption that we were not strangers seemed scarcely strange, so  near within these few minutes had my trouble and her sympathetic tears  brought us.    \"I will promise, when you come to me,\" she added, with an expression of  charming archness, passing, as she continued, into one of enthusiasm,  \"to seem as sorry for you as you wish, but you must not for a moment  suppose that I am really sorry for you at all, or that I think you will  long be sorry for yourself. I know, as well as I know that the world  now is heaven compared with what it was in your day, that the only  feeling you will have after a little while will be one of thankfulness  to God that your life in that age was so strangely cut off, to be  returned to you in this.\"        Chapter 9    Dr. and Mrs. Leete were evidently not a little startled to learn, when  they presently appeared, that I had been all over the city alone that  morning, and it was apparent that they were agreeably surprised to see  that I seemed so little agitated after the experience.    \"Your stroll could scarcely have failed to be a very interesting one,\"  said Mrs. Leete, as we sat down to table soon after. \"You must have  seen a good many new things.\"    \"I saw very little that was not new,\" I replied. \"But I think what  surprised me as much as anything was not to find any stores on  Washington Street, or any banks on State. What have you done with the  merchants and bankers? Hung them all, perhaps, as the anarchists wanted  to do in my day?\"    \"Not so bad as that,\" replied Dr. Leete. \"We have simply dispensed with  them. Their functions are obsolete in the modern world.\"    \"Who sells you things when you want to buy them?\" I inquired.    \"There is neither selling nor buying nowadays; the distribution of  goods is effected in another way. As to the bankers, having no money we  have no use for those gentry.\"    \"Miss Leete,\" said I, turning to Edith, \"I am afraid that your father  is making sport of me. I don't blame him, for the temptation my  innocence offers must be extraordinary. But, really, there are limits  to my credulity as to possible alterations in the social system.\"    \"Father has no idea of jesting, I am sure,\" she replied, with a  reassuring smile.    The conversation took another turn then, the point of ladies' fashions  in the nineteenth century being raised, if I remember rightly, by Mrs.  Leete, and it was not till after breakfast, when the doctor had invited  me up to the house-top, which appeared to be a favorite resort of his,  that he recurred to the subject.    \"You were surprised,\" he said, \"at my saying that we got along without  money or trade, but a moment's reflection will show that trade existed  and money was needed in your day simply because the business of  production was left in private hands, and that, consequently, they are  superfluous now.\"    \"I do not at once see how that follows,\" I replied.    \"It is very simple,\" said Dr. Leete. \"When innumerable different and  independent persons produced the various things needful to life and  comfort, endless exchanges between individuals were requisite in order  that they might supply themselves with what they desired. These  exchanges constituted trade, and money was essential as their medium.  But as soon as the nation became the sole producer of all sorts"]]]
