The  fact that they have a bill more like that of the goose than any other  duck, a goose neck also, and that there is no difference in the sexes  will show the reason for such classification. Their generic name,  however, signifies tree-swan. The fulvous tree-duck ranges on our  hunting grounds as far north as Sacramento, where occasionally one is  killed. They come here only to breed and, therefore, late in the  season. Quite a few are killed in southern California, and from  Arizona and Lower California south they are very plentiful. The  black-bellied tree-duck is only met with as a straggler north of  Chihuahua, Mexico. Another species of the same genus (=Dendrocygna  elegans=) is a still more southern bird, seldom seen north of the  state of Guerrero.    =Color=--Sides of head and neck and lower parts, buff; top of head,  back of neck and back, dark brown; wings, dark brown; neck, long and  slim; bill, resembles that of a goose very much. Both sexes alike.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are generally built in a hollow tree or  stump. The eggs number from ten to fifteen and are of an ochreous  white.    =Measurements=--Wing, about 9-1/2; bill, 1-3/4 inches.

THE BAY and SEA DUCKS      As I have already stated the ducks are divided into two subfamilies,  the one the =Anatinae=, commonly called fresh-water ducks, the other  the =Fuligulinae=, commonly known as the salt-water ducks. A  distinguishing feature of the salt-water ducks is the little flap or  web on the hind toe, which is not seen in the fresh-water varieties.    On our shooting grounds, however, whether the blind is on the  salt-water marsh or the fresh-water pond, both kinds are sure to fall  to the gun in almost equal numbers. Of the more common of the  fresh-water varieties the gadwall and the mallard are seen the least  on the salt marshes and the tide overflows, yet even these are quite  often met with in these places. So it is with the salt-water species.  All except the scoters are frequenters of the mountain lakes,  fresh-water ponds and overflows. The red-head, both species of the  scaups, the canvasback and the ruddy are commonly found on the  fresh-waters. The ring-neck, and, in fact, the red-head are much more  common on these waters than on the salt or brackish marshes.    With the exception, therefore, that certain species always predominate  at a given place at certain times of the season, the sportsman's aim  brings down a well-assorted bag, let him shoot where he may, on marsh,  pond or overflow, from Washington to Mexico.        [Illustration: CANVASBACK (Aythya vallisnaria)]      THE CANVASBACK    (Aythya vallisneria)    The canvasback, the duck par excellence of the Eastern states, is very  plentiful in the more northern portions of the territorial scope of  these articles, though I have seen them in good numbers on the lakes  of Mexico. It is the general supposition that the canvasback breeds in  the far north, but from the fact that they are found on the lakes of  Mexico as early as October, they must also breed on the higher lakes  of our mountains. On our lower marshes they are a late duck, but they  appear on our mountain lakes quite early in the season. Canvasback  shooting on our waters affords the finest of sport, as it does not  partake so much of flock shooting as it does on the Chesapeake and the  Delaware rivers. While I certainly prefer our shooting, by no means do  I prefer our ducks. When killed on the mountain lakes, our canvasback  possesses nearly if not quite as fine flavor as do those of the  Eastern states, but when killed on the bays and salt marshes of  California they are fishy and barely palatable. This is caused by the  absence of the so-called wild celery, properly tape grass  (=Vallisneria spiralis=), the common food of the Eastern canvasback.  Our birds have the habit of feeding largely on the shallow waters of  the tide lands and marshes and of consuming large quantities of  crustaceans, such as clams, crabs, mussels and the like, and it takes  but a few days' diet of this kind to make the canvasback about the  poorest of ducks. I have killed these ducks on the high lakes and  ponds of Mexico, when, on account of something they fed upon, they  were really unfit to eat.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, nearly black; back, light gray; bill,  black, and forming nearly a straight line from the tip to the crown of  the head; belly and flanks, nearly white.    Female--Head and neck, cinnamon brown, paler on the throat; back, dark  gray.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest of the canvasback is generally found on some  little knoll in the marsh, and is lined with dead grass and feathers,  and often with considerable down. The eggs, which are about ten in  number, are of a dark creamy white.    =Measurements=--Total length, from 18 to 22 inches; the more northern  birds within the territory here covered will always be found  considerably larger than those of the more southern latitudes. Wing, 8  to 9-1/2 inches, and bill about 2-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: RED-HEAD (Aythya americana)]      THE RED-HEAD    (Aythya americana)    The red-head is quite a common duck in the southern sections of the  Coast hunting grounds. Though purely a bay or salt-water duck, that  is, belonging to the subfamily =Fuligulinae=, it is not found to any  great extent on the salt-water marshes, preferring the higher lakes,  ponds and reservoirs of the mountain valleys and foothills. I found  them one season in great numbers on the San Rafael marshes, high up in  the mountains of Lower California, and all the shooting two friends  and myself wished to do had no effect in driving them away, although  the ponds of the marsh were few and small.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, reddish chestnut; lower neck and upper  breast, sooty brown, a mixture of finely penciled lines of gray and  brown; speculum, gray; back, gray; feathers on the top of the head  almost form a crest; bill, lead color.    Female--Head and neck, light cinnamon brown, very pale on the sides of  the head near the bill, and throat nearly white; breast and shoulders,  dirty light brown, and back a darker dirty brown.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest, like that of the canvasback, is generally  built in the marsh or on the low banks of a lake, usually lined with  down and contains about ten eggs of a brownish buff color.    =Measurements=--Total length, about 20 inches; wing, 8-1/4 to 8-1/2; bill  barely 2-1/4 inches.        [Illustration: AMERICAN SCAUP DUCK OR BLUE-BILL                   (Aythya marila neartica)]      THE AMERICAN SCAUP, OR BLUE-BILL    (Aythya marila neartica)    The American scaup, or blue-bill, the lesser scaup (=Aythya affinis=)  and the ring-neck (=Aythya collaris=) are very plentiful from  Washington to Mexico. These three species are generally grouped  together by the sportsmen of the Coast under the name of black jacks,  black ducks, black-heads or blue-bills; all three species being  considered as belonging to the one variety, and the lesser scaup  (=Aythya affinis=) as the younger birds. With the males, at least,  there should be no excuse for this error, for they can be easily  distinguished by the color of the speculum, or bright band on the  wings, and by the color of the metallic sheen of the head and neck.  The speculum of the American scaup, or larger blue-bill, is white, the  head and neck showing a greenish sheen, quite pronounced in the  sunlight. The lesser scaup, or little blue-bill (=Aythya affinis=) has  a white speculum also, but the sheen of the head and neck is purple.  The ring-neck (=Aythya collaris=), has a gray speculum, which, though  quite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#11)"],[1,"on  the South-downs previous to final emigration.

THE WHINCHAT     PRATANCOLA RUBA%TRA        Upper plumage dusky brown, edged with reddish yellow; over the      eye a broad white streak; throat and sides of the neck white;      neck and breast bright yellowish red; a large white spot on      the wings and base of the tail; extremity of the latter and      the whole of the two central feathers dusky brown; abdomen and      flanks yellowish white. _Female_--yellowish white wherever the      _male_ is pure white; the white spot on the wings smaller; the      red parts dingy. Length five inches; breadth nine inches. Eggs      bluish green, often minutely speckled with light brownish red.    A great deal that we have said of the Stonechat, will apply equally to  the Whinchat, as the two birds much resemble each other in character,  size, and habits. There is this difference, however, between them,  that a considerable number of Stonechats remain in Britain during the  winter, whereas the Whinchats, almost to a bird, leave our shores in  the autumn. The latter is by no means so common, and is rarely seen  except in wild places where the shrub is abundant from which it  derives its name of Whinchat, or Furzechat. For a small bird to have  black legs is, it seems, considered in France an indication of  peculiar delicacy of flesh. Both of these birds, therefore,  notwithstanding their diminutive size, are much sought after for the  table. Both are of restless habits, delighting to perch on the summit  of a furze-bush, where they keep the tail in constant motion,  occasionally spring into the air after an insect, and then dart off  with a dipping flight to another post of advantage. They repeat the  call of A1/4-_tick_! and their short and simple song, both while at rest  and on the wing; but they are not musical, and 'their flesh is  generally more esteemed than their song.' The Whinchat may be  distinguished at a considerable distance by the white streak over the  eye. Both nest and eggs of the two species are very similar.        THE STONECHAT     PRATANCOLA RUBACOLA        Head, throat, bill and legs, black; sides of the neck near the      wing, tertial wing-coverts and rump, white; breast bright      chestnut-red, shaded into yellowish white towards the tail;      feathers of the back, wings and tail, black, with reddish      brown edges. _Female_--feathers of the head and upper parts      dusky brown, edged with yellowish red; throat black, with      small whitish and reddish spots; less white in the wings and      tail; the red of the breast dull. Length five and a quarter      inches; breadth eight and a half inches. Eggs pale blue, the      larger end often faintly speckled with reddish brown.    We can scarcely pass through a furze-brake during the spring and  summer months, without having the presence of the Stonechat almost  forced on our notice. I am acquainted with no small bird whose habits  are more marked, or more easily observed. Not even does the Skylark  build its nest more invariably on the ground, and 'soaring sings, and  singing soars', than does the Stonechat build its nest in a  furze-bush, and perch on the topmost twigs of shrubs. In the breeding  season, too, it seems not to wander far from its home: we know  therefore where a pair are to be found at any time; and they allow us  to approach so close to them, that we can readily distinguish them by  the tints of their plumage.    The nest of the pair may be within a few yards of the spot on which we  are standing; but the exact locality no one knows, nor is likely to  know but itself. The male is a beautiful creature, with a black head,  red breast, and several patches of pure white on its wings, the female  much more sober in her attire. Their purpose is evidently to distract  our attention from their nest. One is clinging to the top of a  Juniper, where he fidgets about uttering his _twit-click-click_, which  you can easily imitate by whistling once sharply and knocking two  stones together twice in rapid succession. The other is perched on the  top spine of a furze-bush--they are aspiring birds and must settle on  the _top_ of whatever they alight on, be it only a dock. Now one dips  down and is lost for a few seconds, to appear again, however, directly  on the summit of another bush; now they are on our right hand, now on  our left; now before us, and then behind. Are they describing a circle  round their nest for a centre, or are they trying to trick us into  the belief that they are better worth caring for than their young  ones, and may be caught if we will only be silly enough to chase them?  I do not know; but whatever their thoughts may be, _we_ certainly are  in them, and as certainly they are not delighted at our presence. We  walk on, and suddenly they are gone; but presently we encounter  another pair of the same birds, who if we loiter about will treat us  in exactly the same way, but, if we pass on steadily, will take little  notice of us.    We have little more to say of the Stonechat. It is not often heard to  sing; the reason probably being that, when listeners are in the way,  it is too anxious about its nest to be musical. Its food is  principally insects, which it often catches on the wing. In winter  (for they do not all leave us at this season) it feeds on worms, etc.  Its nest is remarkable more from its size and position (usually in the  centre of a furze-bush), than for neatness of structure. It lays five  eggs. Its name RubA-cola denotes a dweller among brambles, and is by no  means inappropriate, as it rarely perches on any bush exceeding a  bramble in size. Its names Stonechat, Stoneclink or Stonechatter, are  evidently to be traced to the similarity between its note of alarm and  the striking together of two pebbles.        THE REDSTART     RUTICILLA PHOENICURA        Forehead white; throat black; head and upper part of the back      bluish grey; breast, tail-coverts and tail (except the two      central feathers, which are brown), bright rust-red; second      primary equal to the sixth. _Female_--upper parts grey, tinged      with red; larger wing-coverts edged with yellowish red; throat      and abdomen whitish; breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts,      pale red. Length, five inches and a quarter. Eggs uniform      blue.    Although of no great size this summer visitor is pretty sure to  attract attention by its peculiar colouring; its red tail and white  crown being sufficient to distinguish it from every other British  bird. It is familiar, too, in its habits, commonly resorting to  gardens, and searching for its favourite food, worms and insects, on  the lawn, and in orchards. It is local rather than rare, for while  there are some places to which it regularly resorts every year, there  are others in which it is never seen. Redstarts arrive in this country  about the end of April, and soon set about the work of building their  nest. This they generally place in a hole in a wall or hollow of a  tree, but sometimes by the mossy stump or amongst the exposed roots of  a tree. Occasionally they select a quaint domicile, a garden pot, for  example, left bottom upwards, or a sea-kale bed. A still stranger  instance is that of a pair of Redstarts, who, themselves or their  descendants, were for twenty years located in the box of a wooden  pump. On one occasion, the pump being out of order, the owner  employed workmen to repair it. This proceeding offended the birds, who  deserted it for three years, and then, forgetting or forgiving the  intrusion, returned to their unquiet home. Another pair constructed  their nest for ten successive years in the interior of an earthenware  fountain placed in the middle of a garden. But though not averse to  the haunts of men, the Redstart shows much anxiety when its nest is  approached, flitting about restlessly and uttering a plaintive cry. I  happened once to be walking in a friend's garden, and heard what I  supposed to be the chirping of two birds proceed from a large  apple-tree close by. As the notes were not familiar to me, I went  round the tree several times in order to discover whence they  proceeded. One of the notes was like the noise which may be made by  striking two pebbles together, the other a querulous chirp, and they  seemed to come from different parts of the tree. The author of the  music, however, allowed me several times to come very near him, and I  satisfied myself that both sounds proceeded from the same bird, a male  Redstart, whose nest, I afterwards heard, was built in an adjoining  shed. This singular power of ventriloquizing, or making its note  apparently proceed from a distant place, is possessed also by the  Nightingale, as any one may assure himself who will quietly creep up  to within a few yards of one of these birds when singing. The song of  the Redstart is short but pleasing, and it is emitted both while the  bird is at rest and on the wing, principally in the morning, and only  during two months of the year. Its food consists of small worms and  insects, which last it is very expert at catching on the wing; and in  summer, it regales itself on the soft fruits. Its nest is composed of  fibrous roots and moss, and is lined with hair, wool and feathers. It  lays about six eggs, which closely resemble those of the  Hedge-sparrow, only that they are smaller. In autumn, the Redstarts  retire southwards. On the African shores of the Mediterranean they are  very abundant, and are caught by the Arabs in traps of the simplest  construction. On the continent of Europe, notably in Italy, in spite  of their diminutive size, they are highly prized for food. The number  of Redstarts (both kinds), Redbreasts Fly-catchers and Nightingales  taken in traps is inconceivable. These birds being of about the same  size, and equally excellent in delicacy"]]]
