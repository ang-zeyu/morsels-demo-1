It was while the crowd was  laughing and chattering at the picnic-table of new boards from the mill  that Mrs. Clymer stole away to her modest little house, and a neighbor  who had followed her was an accidental witness to a singular episode.  Mrs. Clymer was kneeling beside her bed, crying over the picture of a  child, when Clymer entered unexpectedly and attempted to take the picture  from her.    She faced him defiantly. \"You kept that because it looked like him, I  reckon,\" he said. \"You might run back to him. You know what he'd call you  and where you'd stand with your aristocracy.\"    The woman pointed to the door, and the man left without another word, and  so did the listener. Next morning the body of Mrs. Clymer was found  hanging to a beam in the mill. At the inquest the husband owned that he  had \"had a few words\" with her on the previous day, and thought that she  must have suddenly become insane. The jury took this view. News of the  suicide was printed in some of the city papers, and soon after that the  gossips had another sensation, for a fair-haired man, also from Brooklyn,  arrived at the place and asked where the woman was buried. When he found  the grave he sat beside it for some time, his head resting on his hand;  then he inquired for Clymer, but Clymer, deadly pale, had gone into the  woods as soon as he heard that a stranger had arrived. The new-comer went  to Trenton, where he ordered a gravestone bearing the single word  \"Estella\" to be placed where the woman's body had been interred. Clymer  quickly sold out and disappeared. The mill never prospered, and has long  been in a ruinous condition. People of the neighborhood think that the  ghost of Mrs. Clymer--was that her name?--still troubles it, and they  pass the place with quickened steps.          OLD INDIAN FACE    On Lower Ausable Pond is a large, ruddy rock showing a huge profile, with  another, resembling a pappoose, below it. When the Tahawi ruled this  region their sachem lived here at \"the Dark Cup,\" as they called this  lake, a man renowned for virtue and remarkable, in his age, for  gentleness. When his children had died and his manly grandson, who was  the old man's hope, had followed them to the land of the cloud mountains,  Adota's heart withered within him, and standing beneath this rock, he  addressed his people, recounting what he had done for them, how he had  swept their enemies from the Lakes of the Clustered Stars (the Lower  Saranac) and Silver Sky (Upper Saranac) to the Lake of Wandah, gaining a  land where they might hunt and fish in peace. The little one, the Star,  had been ravished away to crown the brow of the thunder god, who, even  now, was advancing across the peaks, bending the woods and lighting the  valleys with his jagged torches.    Life was nothing to him longer; he resigned it.    As he spoke these words he fell back, and the breath passed out of him.  Then came the thunder god, and with an appalling burst of fire sent the  people cowering. The roar that followed seemed to shake the earth, but  the medicine-man of the tribe stood still, listening to the speech of the  god in the clouds. \"Tribe of the Tahawi,\" he translated, \"Adota treads  the star-path to the happy hunting-grounds, and the sun is shining on his  heart. He will never walk among you again, but the god loves both him and  you, and he will set his face on the mountains. Look!\" And, raising their  eyes, they beheld the likeness of Adota and of his beloved child, the  Star, graven by lightning-stroke on the cliff. There they buried the body  of Adota and held their solemn festivals until the white men drove them  out of the country.          THE DIVISION OF THE SARANACS    In the middle of the last century a large body of Saranac Indians  occupied the forests of the Upper Saranac through which ran the Indian  carrying-place, called by them the Eagle Nest Trail. Whenever they raided  the Tahawi on the slopes of Mount Tahawus (Sky-splitter), there was a  pleasing rivalry between two young athletes, called the Wolf and the  Eagle, as to which would carry off the more scalps, and the tribe was  divided in admiration of them. There was one who did not share this  liking: an old sachem, one of the wizards who had escaped when the Great  Spirit locked these workers of evil in the hollow trees that stood beside  the trail. In their struggles to escape the less fortunate ones thrust  their arms through the closing bark, and they are seen there, as withered  trunks and branches, to this day. Oquarah had not been softened by this  exhibition of danger nor the qualification of mercy that allowed him  still to exist. Rather he was more bitter when he saw, as he fancied,  that the tribe thought more of the daring and powerful warriors than it  did of the bent and malignant-minded counsellor.    It was in the moon of green leaves that the two young men set off to hunt  the moose, and on the next day the Wolf returned alone. He explained that  in the hunt they had been separated; he had called for hours for his  friend, and had searched so long that he concluded he must have returned  ahead of him. But he was not at the camp. Up rose the sachem with visage  dark. \"I hear a forked tongue,\" he cried. \"The Wolf was jealous of the  Eagle and his teeth have cut into his heart.\"    \"The Wolf cannot lie,\" answered the young man.    \"Where is the Eagle?\" angrily shouted the sachem, clutching his hatchet.    \"The Wolf has said,\" replied the other.    The old sachem advanced upon him, but as he raised his axe to strike, the  wife of the Wolf threw herself before her husband, and the steel sank  into her brain. The sachem fell an instant later with the Wolf's knife in  his heart, and instantly the camp was in turmoil. Before the day had  passed it had been broken up, and the people were divided into factions,  for it was no longer possible to hold it together in peace. The Wolf,  with half of the people, went down the Sounding River to new  hunting-grounds, and the earth that separated the families was reddened  whenever one side met the other.    Years had passed when, one morning, the upper tribe saw a canoe advancing  across the Lake of the Silver Sky. An old man stepped from it: he was the  Eagle. After the Wolf had left him he had fallen into a cleft in a rock,  and had lain helpless until found by hunters who were on their way to  Canada. He had joined the British against the French, had married a  northern squaw, but had returned to die among the people of his early  love. Deep was his sorrow that his friend should have been accused of  doing him an injury, and that the once happy tribe should have been  divided by that allegation. The warriors and sachems of both branches  were summoned to a council, and in his presence they swore a peace, so  that in the fulness of time he was able to die content. That peace was  always kept.          AN EVENT IN INDIAN PARK    It was during the years when the Saranacs were divided that Howling Wind,  one of the young men of Indian Carry, saw and fell in love with a girl of  the family on Tupper Lake. He quickly found a way to tell his liking, and  the couple met often in the woods and on the shore. He made bold to row  her around the quieter bays, and one moonlight evening he took her to  Devil's Rock, or Devil's Pulpit, where he told her the story of the  place. This was to the effect that the fiend had paddled, on timbers, by  means of his tail, to that rock, and had assembled fish and game about  him in large numbers by telling them that he was going to preach to them,  instead of which moral procedure he pounced upon and ate all that were  within his grasp.    As so often happened in Indian history, the return of these lovers was  seen by a disappointed rival, who had hurried back to camp and secured  the aid of half a dozen men to arrest the favored one as soon as he  should land. The capture was made after a struggle, and Howling Wind was  dragged to the chief's tent for sentence. That sentence was death, and  with a refinement of cruelty that was rare even among the Indians, the  girl was ordered to execute it. She begged and wept to no avail. An axe  was put into her hands, and she was ordered to despatch the prisoner. She  took the weapon; her face grew stern and the tears dried on her cheeks;  her lover, bound to a tree, gazed at her in amazement; his rival watched,  almost in glee. Slowly the girl crossed the open space to her lover. She  raised the tomahawk and at a blow severed the thongs that held him, then,  like a flash, she leaped upon his rival, who had sprung forward to  interfere, and clove his skull with a single stroke. The lovers fled as  only those can fly who run for life. Happily for them, they met a party  from the Carry coming to rescue Howling Wind from the danger to which his  courtship had exposed him, and it was even said that this party entered  the village and by presenting knives and arrows at the breast of the  chief obtained his now superfluous consent to the union of the fugitives.  The pair reached the Carry in safety and lived a long and happy life  together.          THE INDIAN PLUME    Brightest flower that grows beside the brooks is the scarlet blossom of  the Indian plume: the blood of Lenawee. Hundreds of years ago she lived  happily among her brother and sister Saranacs beside Stony Creek, the  Stream of the Snake, and was soon to marry the comely youth who, for the  speed of his foot, was called the Arrow. But one summer the Quick Death  came on the people, and as the viewless devil stalked through the village  young and old fell before him. The Arrow was the first to die. In vain  the Prophet smoked the Great Calumet: its smoke ascending took no shape  that he could read. In vain was the white dog killed to take aloft the  people's sins.

And had I desired it I could have sat upon its  seat. But now am I weary of thy follies, and I will turn me away from  Iran, and when this Turk shall have put you under his yoke I shall not  learn thereof.\"    Then he turned him and strode from out the presence-chamber. And he  sprang upon Rakush, who waited without, and he was vanished from before  their eyes ere yet the nobles had rallied from their astonishment. And  they were downcast and oppressed with boding cares, and they held  counsel among themselves what to do; for Rustem was their mainstay, and  they knew that, bereft of his arm and counsel, they could not stand  against this Turk. And they blamed Kai Kaous, and counted over the good  deeds that Rustem had done for him, and they pondered and spake long.  And in the end they resolved to send a messenger unto Kai Kaous, and  they chose from their midst Gudarz the aged, and bade him stand before  the Shah. And Gudarz did as they desired, and he spake long and without  fear, and he counted over each deed that had been done by Rustem; and he  reproached the Shah with his ingratitude, and he said how Rustem was the  shepherd, and how the flock could not be led without its leader. And Kai  Kaous heard him unto the end, and he knew that his words were the words  of reason and truth, and he was ashamed of that which he had done, and  confounded when he beheld his acts thus naked before him. And he humbled  himself before Gudarz, and said:    \"That which thou sayest, surely it is right.\"    And he entreated Gudarz to go forth and seek Rustem, and bid him forget  the evil words of his Shah, and bring him back to the succor of Iran.  And Gudarz hastened forth to do as Kai Kaous desired, and he told the  nobles of his mission, and they joined themselves unto him, and all the  chiefs of Iran went forth in quest of Rustem. And when they had found  him, they prostrated themselves into the dust before him, and Gudarz  told him of his mission, and he prayed him to remember that Kai Kaous  was a man devoid of understanding, whose thoughts flowed over like to  new wine that fermenteth. And he said:    \"Though Rustem be angered against the King, yet hath the land of Iran  done no wrong that it should perish at his hands. Yet, if Rustem save it  not, surely it will fall under this Turk.\"    But Rustem said, \"My patience hath an end, and I fear none but God. What  is this Kai Kaous that he should anger me? and what am I that I have  need of him? I have not deserved the evil words that he spake unto me,  but now will I think of them no longer, but cast aside all thoughts of  Iran.\"    When the nobles heard these words they grew pale, and fear took hold on  their hearts. But Gudarz, full of wisdom, opened his mouth, and said:    \"O Pehliva! the land, when it shall learn of this, will deem that Rustem  is fled before the face of this Turk; and when men shall believe that  Tehemten is afraid, they will cease to combat, and Iran will be  downtrodden at his hands. Turn thee not, therefore, at this hour from  thy allegiance to the Shah, and tarnish not thy glory by this retreat,  neither suffer that the downfall of Iran rest upon thy head. Put from  thee, therefore, the words that Kai Kaous spake in his empty anger, and  lead us forth to battle against this Turk. For it must not be spoken  that Rustem feared to fight a beardless boy.\"    And Rustem listened, and pondered these words in his heart, and knew  that they were good. But he said:    \"Fear hath never been known of me, neither hath Rustem shunned the din  of arms, and I depart not because of Sohrab, but because that scorn and  insult have been my recompense.\"    Yet when he had pondered a while longer, he saw that he must return unto  the Shah. So he did that which he knew to be right, and he rode till he  came unto the gates of Kai Kaous, and he strode with a proud step into  his presence.    Now when the Shah beheld Rustem from afar, he stepped down from off his  throne and came before Pehliva, and craved his pardon for that which was  come about. And he said how he had been angered because Rustem had  tarried in his coming, and how haste was his birthright, and how he had  forgotten himself in his vexation. But now was his mouth filled with the  dust of repentance. And Rustem said:    \"The world is the Shah's, and it behoveth thee to do as beseemeth thee  best with thy servants. And until old age shall my loins be girt in  fealty unto thee. And may power and majesty be thine for ever!\"    And Kai Kaous answered and said, \"O my Pehliva, may thy days be blessed  unto the end!\"    Then he invited him to feast with him, and they drank wine till far into  the night, and held counsel together how they should act; and slaves  poured rich gifts before Rustem, and the nobles rejoiced, and all was  well again within the gates of the King.    Then when the sun had risen and clothed the world with love, the  clarions of war were sounded throughout the city, and men made them  ready to go forth in enmity before the Turks. And the legions of Persia  came forth at the behest of their Shah, and their countless thousands  hid the earth under their feet, and the air was darkened by their  spears. And when they were come unto the plains where stood the fortress  of Hujir, they set up their tents as was their manner. So the watchman  saw them from the battlements, and he set up a great cry. And Sohrab  heard the cry, and questioned the man wherefore he shouted; and when he  learned that the enemy were come, he rejoiced, and demanded a cup of  wine, and drank to their destruction. Then he called forth Human and  showed him the army, and bade him be of good cheer, for he said that he  saw within its ranks no hero of mighty mace who could stand against  himself. So he bade his warriors to a banquet of wine, and he said that  they would feast until the time was come to meet their foes in battle.  And they did as Sohrab said.    Now when night had thrown her mantle over the earth, Rustem came before  the Shah and craved that he would suffer him to go forth beyond the camp  that he might see what manner of man was this stripling. And Kai Kaous  granted his request, and said that it was worthy a Pehliva of renown.  Then Rustem went forth disguised in the garb of a Turk, and he entered  the castle in secret, and he came within the chamber where Sohrab held  his feast. Now when he had looked upon the boy he saw that he was like  to a tall cypress of good sap, and that his arms were sinewy and strong  like to the flanks of a camel, and that his stature was that of a hero.  And he saw that round about him stood brave warriors. And slaves with  golden bugles poured wine before them, and they were all glad, neither  did they dream of sorrow. Then it came about that while Rustem regarded  them, Zindeh changed his seat and came nigh unto the spot where Rustem  was watching. Now Zindeh was brother unto Tahmineh, and she had sent him  forth with her son that he might point out to him his father, whom he  alone knew of all the army, and she did it that harm might not befall if  the heroes should meet in battle. Now Zindeh, when he had changed his  seat, thought that he espied a watcher, and he strode toward the place  where Rustem was hid, and he came before him and said--    \"Who art thou? Come forth into the light that I may behold thy face.\"    But ere he could speak further, Rustem had lifted up his hand and struck  him, and laid him dead upon the ground.    Now Sohrab, when he saw that Zindeh was gone out, was disquieted, and he  asked of his slaves wherefore the hero returned not unto the banquet. So  they went forth to seek him, and when they had found him in his blood,  they came and told Sohrab what they had seen. But Sohrab would not  believe it; so he ran to the spot and bade them bring torches, and all  the warriors and singing girls followed after him. Then when Sohrab saw  that it was true he was sore grieved; but he suffered not that the  banquet be ended, for he would not that the spirits of his men be damped  with pity. So they went back yet again to the feast.    Meanwhile Rustem returned him to the camp, and as he would have entered  the lines he encountered Gew, who went around to see that all was safe.  And Gew, when he saw a tall man clad In the garb of a Turk, drew his  sword and held himself ready for combat. But Rustem smiled and opened  his mouth, and Gew knew his voice, and came to him and questioned him  what he did without in the darkness. And Rustem told him. Then he went  before Kai Kaous also and related what he had seen, and how no man like  unto Sohrab was yet come forth from amid the Turks. And he likened him  unto Saum, the son of Neriman.    Now when the morning was come, Sohrab put on his armour. Then he went  unto a height whence he could look down over the camp of the Iranians.  And he took with him Hujir, and spake to him, saying:    \"Seek not to deceive me, nor swerve from the paths of truth. For if thou  reply unto my questions with sincerity, I will loosen thy bonds and give  thee treasures; but if thou deceive me, thou shalt languish till death  in thy chains.\"    And Hujir said, \"I will give answer unto thee according to my  knowledge.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"I am about to question thee concerning the nobles  whose camps are spread beneath our feet, and thou shalt name unto me  those whom I point out. Behold yon tent of gold brocade, adorned with  skins of leopard, before whose doors stand an hundred elephants of war.  Within its gates is a throne of turquoise, and over it floateth a  standard of violet with a moon and sun worked in its centre. Tell unto  me now whose is this pavilion that standeth thus in the midst of the  whole camp?\"    And Hujir replied, \"It pertaineth unto the Shah of Iran.\"    Then Sohrab said, \"I behold on its right hand yet another tent draped in  the colours of mourning, and above it floateth a standard whereon is"]]]
