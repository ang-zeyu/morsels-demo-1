[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#11)"],[1," England supported by a griffin and a dog, we  enter a quadrangular court and thence pass into the great hall, with its  open timber roof black with the smoke of centuries. The screen beneath  the music gallery is elaborately carved with leaf tracery, grotesque  figures of mounted knights, and the escutcheon of the Compton arms.  Above the gallery we notice the huge oak beams which form the  half-timber portion of one of the principal gables, and cannot help  comparing these tremendous oak trunks with the modern laths plastered in  front of houses: a futile attempt to imitate this popular style, without  aiming at its _object_--strength.    The screen of the chapel, like that of the hall, is ornamented with  grotesque carvings, including a battle royal between some monks and his  Satanic Majesty, who by the way has one of the ninety rooms all to  himself, and reached by a special spiral staircase. Near the \"Devil's  chamber\" is another small room whose ghostly occupant is evidently a  member of the fresh-air league, for he will persist in having the window  open, and no matter how often it is closed it is always found to be  open. What a pity this sanitary ghost does not take up his abode where  oxygen is scarcer. But these are by no means the only mysterious rooms  at Compton Wyniates, for not a few have secret entrances and exits, and  one dark corridor is provided with a movable floor, which when removed,  drawbridge fashion, makes an excellent provision for safety so long as  you are on the right side of the chasm. Such ingenious arrangements were  as necessary in a private residence, miles from anywhere, as the  bathroom is in a suburban villa. There are secret \"barracks\" in the  roof, with storage for a regiment of soldiers, if necessary. The popish  chapel, too, has ample provision for the security of its priest. There  are four staircases leading up to it, and a regular rabbit-warren  between the beams of the roof and the wainscoting, where if needs be he  could run in case of danger.    \"Henry VIII.'s room,\" and \"Charles I.'s room,\" are both pointed out.  The latter slept a night here prior to the battle of Edgehill, and the  bluff king honoured the builder of the mansion, Sir William Compton,  with a visit in memory of old days, when his host as a boy had been his  page. Dugdale tells us that Sir William got his building material from  the ruinous castle of Fulbrooke, so his bricks were mellowed with time  when the house was first erected. The knight's grandson became Baron  Compton in Elizabeth's reign, and his son William, Earl of Northampton  in 1618. A romantic episode in the life of this nobleman was his  elopement with Elizabeth Spencer of Canonbury Tower, Islington. The lady  was a very desirable match, being the only daughter of Sir John Spencer,  the richest heiress of her time. Notwithstanding her strict seclusion at  Canonbury, Lord William Compton, of whom she was enamoured, succeeded in  the absence of her father in gaining admission to the house in the  disguise of a baker, and carried her off in his basket. To perform so  muscular a feat was proof enough of his devotion, so at the end of a  year all was forgotten and forgiven. Their son, the valiant second earl,  Spencer Compton, won his spurs and lost his life fighting for the king  at Hopton Heath. His portrait by Janssen may be seen at Castle Ashby.    His son James, the third earl, also fought for Charles, and attended his  son at the Restoration; but his younger brother Henry, Bishop of London,  aided the Revolution, and crowned Dutch William and his queen.    Only within the last half-century has the mansion been occupied as a  residence. For nearly a century before it was neglected and deserted.  The rooms were bare of furniture, for, alas! its contents, including  Henry VIII.'s State bed, had been removed or sold. That delightful  writer William Howitt in 1840 said the house had not been inhabited for  ninety years, with the exception of a portion of the east front, which  was used by the bailiff. The rooms were empty and the walls were naked.  His concluding wish fortunately long since has been realised--namely,  that its noble owner would yet cause the restoration and refitting of  Compton Wyniates to all its ancient state.    Warwickshire is rich in ancestral houses and mediaeval castles. Take, for  example, the fortresses of Kenilworth, Warwick, Maxstoke, and Tamworth,  or the fine old houses Coombe Abbey, Charlecote, and Baddesley Clinton.  The last named perhaps is least known of these, but by no means the  least interesting. This old moated Hall of the Ferrers family is buried  in the thickly wooded country on the high tableland which occupies the  very heart of England. As to the actual centre, there are two places  which claim this distinction; but oddly enough they are quite twelve  miles apart. The one between Leamington and Warwick, the other to the  west of Coventry. The latter spot is marked by the village cross of  Meriden, and the former by an old oak tree by the main road. Baddesley  Clinton is nearly equidistant from both, south of Meriden and north-west  of Leamington and Warwick.    Few houses so thoroughly retain their ancient appearance as Baddesley.  It dates from the latter part of the fifteenth century, and is a  singularly well-preserved specimen of a moated and fortified manor-house  of that period. Like Compton Wyniates, its situation is very secluded in  its densely wooded park, and formerly there was a double moat for extra  defence; but for all its retiredness and security, the old house has a  kindly greeting for those who are interested in such monuments of the  past. A stone bridge across the moat leads to a projecting embattled  tower with a wide depressed archway, showing provision for a portcullis  with a large mullioned window over it. In general appearance the front  resembles the moated house of Ightham, with which it is coeval, and the  half-timbered gables of the courtyard are somewhat similar. Unlike  Charlecote, the interior is as untouched as the exterior. Everywhere  there are quaint old \"linen\" panelled rooms and richly carved  chimney-pieces--windows of ancient heraldic glass, and old furniture,  tapestry, and paintings. The hall is not like some, that never look cosy  unless there is a blazing log fire in the hearth. There is something  particularly inviting in this old room, with its deep-recessed mullioned  window by the great freestone Jacobean fireplace. What pictures could  not the imagination conjure up in this cosy corner in the twilight of an  autumn day! On the first floor over the entrance archway is the  \"banqueting-room,\" with high coved ceiling and tapestry-lined walls.  Beyond this is \"Lord Charles' room,\" haunted, it is said, by a handsome  youth with raven hair. Many years ago this spectre was seen by two of  the late Mr. Marmion Ferrers' aunts when they were children, and they  long remembered his face and steadfast gaze. A mysterious lady dressed  in rich black brocade is occasionally encountered in the corridors in  broad daylight, like the famous \"Brown Lady\" of Raynham Hall.    The ancient chapel was set up by Sir Edward Ferrers when the little  parish church was taken from the family at the Reformation. In the  thickness of the wall close at hand there is a secret passage which  leads down to a little water-gate by the moat beneath which a narrow  passage runs, so that there were two ready means of escape in troublous  times; and in the roof on the east side of the house there is a priest's  hole provided with a fixed bench. Marmion Ferrers above alluded to, who  died in 1884, was the eighth in descent from father to son from Henry  Ferrers of Elizabeth's time. Both were learned antiquarians. Marmion  Ferrers was a typical squire of the old school, and we well remember  with what pride he showed us round his ancestral home. But his pride  ended there, as is shown by the following anecdote. One day he  encountered an old woman in the park who had been gathering sticks  without permission. She dropped her heavy bundle and was about to offer  apologies for trespassing, when the good old squire, seeing that her  load was too much for her strength, without a word slung the burden on  his shoulder and carried it to the woman's humble dwelling.    This calls to mind a story of a contemporary squire who lived some fifty  miles away in the adjoining county, an antiquary who was also known for  his acts of kindness and hospitality. In the vicinity of his ancient  Hall a tramp had found a job, and the baronet was anxious to test his  butler's honesty. He therefore offered to lend the man a hand and help  him carry some bundles of faggots into an adjacent yard, if he would  share profits. This was agreed upon, and when the work was done the  tramp went off to the Hall to ask for his money, promising to join his  assistant in a lane at the back of the house. Meanwhile the squire  hurried to his study, and when the butler made his appearance handed him  five shillings. Then donning his shabby coat and hat he hastened back.  Presently the tramp came up with beaming countenance and held out half a  crown, saying they were both well rewarded with one and threepence each.  But the assistant grumbled, and said it was miserable pay, and at length  persuaded the man to return and ask to see the squire and explain the  amount of work that had been done. Again he returned to his sanctum, and  hearing the bell ring told the butler to admit the man, and he would  hear what he had to say. Having enjoyed the fun--the tramp's surprise  and the butler's discomfort, he dismissed them both--one with half a  guinea, the other from his service.    Baddesley Clinton church, shut in by tall trees a bow-shot from the  Hall, is famous for its eastern window of heraldic glass, which shows  the various noble families with whom the Ferrers intermarried. By the  union of Marmion Ferrers' father"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#11)"],[1,"him they were afraid of him, and of his  hideous look.    5 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and said to them, \"This is  he who was hidden in the serpent, and who deceived you, and stripped  you of the garment of light and glory in which you were.    6 This is he who promised you majesty and divinity.  Where, then, is  the beauty that was on him?  Where is his divinity?  Where is his  light?  Where is the glory that rested on him?    7 Now his figure is hideous; he is become abominable among angels; and  he has come to be called Satan.    8 O Adam, he wished to take from you this earthly garment of  sheep-skins, and to destroy it, and not let you be covered with it.    9 What, then, is his beauty that you should have followed him?  And  what have you gained by obeying him?  See his evil works and then look  at Me; at Me, your Creator, and at the good deeds I do you.    10 See, I bound him until you came and saw him and beheld his weakness,  that no power is left with him.\"    11 And God released him from his bonds.          Chapter LII - Adam and Eve sew the first shirt.    1 After this Adam and Eve said no more, but cried before God on account  of their creation, and of their bodies that required an earthly  covering.    2 Then Adam said to Eve, \"O Eve, this is the skin of beasts with which  we shall be covered,  but when we put it on, behold, we shall be  wearing a token of death on our bodies. Just  as the owners of these  skins have died and have wasted away,  so also shall we die and pass  away.\"    3 Then Adam and Eve took the skins, and went back to the Cave of  Treasures; and when in it, they stood and prayed as they were  accustomed.    4 And they thought how they could make garments of those skins; for  they had no skill for it.    5 Then God sent to them His angel to show them how to work it out.  And  the angel said to Adam, \"Go forth, and bring some palm-thorns.\"  Then  Adam went out, and brought some, as the angel had commanded him.    6 Then the angel began before them to work out the skins, after the  manner of one who prepares a shirt.  And he took the thorns and stuck  them into the skins, before their eyes.    7 Then the angel again stood up and prayed God that the thorns in those  skins should be hidden, so as to be, as it were, sewn with one thread.    8 And so it was, by God's order; they became garments for Adam and Eve,  and He clothed them therewith.    9 From that time the nakedness of their bodies was covered from the  sight of each other's eyes.    10 And this happened at the end of the fifty-first day.    11 Then when Adam's and Eve's bodies were covered, they stood and  prayed, and sought mercy of the Lord, and forgiveness, and gave Him  thanks for that He had had mercy on them, and had covered their  nakedness.  And they ceased not from prayer the whole of that night.    12 Then when the morning dawned at the rising of the sun, they said  their prayers after their custom; and then went out of the cave.    13 And Adam said to Eve, \"Since we don't know what there is to the west  of this cave, let us go out and see it today.\" Then they came forth and  went toward the western border.          Chapter LIII - The prophecy of the Western Lands and of the great flood.    1 They were not very far from the cave, when Satan came towards them,  and hid himself between them and the cave, under the form of two  ravenous lions three days without food, that came towards Adam and Eve,  as if to break them in pieces and devour them.    2 Then Adam and Eve cried, and prayed God to deliver them from their  paws.    3 Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away the lions from them.    4 And God said to Adam, \"O Adam, what do you seek on the western  border?  And why have you left of thine own accord the eastern border,  in which was your living place?    5 Now then, turn back to your cave, and remain in it, so that Satan  won't deceive you or work his purpose over you.    6 For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from you a  descendant, that shall replenish it; and that will defile themselves  with their sins, and with their yielding to the commands of Satan, and  by following his works.    7 Therefore will I bring over them the waters of a flood, and overwhelm  them all.  But I will deliver what is left of the righteous among them;  and I will bring them to a distant land, and the land in which you live  now shall remain desolate and without one inhabitant in it.    8 After God had thus spoken to them, they went back to the Cave of  Treasures.  But their flesh was dried up, and they were weak from  fasting and praying, and from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed  against God.          Chapter LIV - Adam and Eve go exploring.    1 Then Adam and Eve stood up in the cave and prayed the whole of that  night until the morning dawned.  And when the sun was risen they both  went out of the cave; their heads were wandering from heaviness of  sorrow and they didn't know where they were going.    2 And they walked in that condition to the southern border of the  garden.  And they began to go up that border until they came to the  eastern border beyond which there was no more land.    3 And the cherub who guarded the garden was standing at the western  gate, and guarding it against Adam and Eve, lest they should suddenly  come into the garden.  And the cherub turned around, as if to put them  to death; according to the commandment God had given him.    4 When Adam and Eve came to the eastern border of the garden--thinking  in their hearts that the cherub was not watching--as they were standing  by the gate as if wishing to go in, suddenly came the cherub with a  flashing sword of fire in his hand; and when he saw them, he went forth  to kill them.  For he was afraid that God would destroy him if they  went into the garden without His order.    5 And the sword of the cherub seemed to shoot flames a distance away  from it.  But when he raised it over Adam and Eve, the flame of the  sword did not flash forth.    6 Therefore the cherub thought that God was favorable to them, and was  bringing them back into the garden.  And the cherub stood wondering.    7 He could not go up to Heaven to determine God's order regarding their  getting into the garden; he therefore continued to stand by them,  unable as he was to part from them; for he was afraid that if  they  should enter the garden without permission, God would destroy him.    8 When Adam and Eve saw the cherub coming towards them with a flaming  sword of fire in his hand, they fell on their faces from fear, and were  as dead.    9 At that time the heavens and the earth shook; and another cherubim  came down from heaven to the cherub who guarded the garden, and saw him  amazed and silent.    10 Then, again, other angels came down close to the place where Adam  and Eve were.  They were divided between joy and sorrow.    11 They were glad, because they thought that God was favorable to Adam,  and wished him to return to the garden; and wished to restore him to  the gladness he once enjoyed.    12 But they sorrowed over Adam, because he was fallen like a dead man,  he and Eve; and they said in their thoughts, \"Adam has not died in this  place; but God has put him to death, for his having come to this place,  and wishing to get into the garden without His permission.\"          Chapter LV - The Conflict between God and Satan.    1 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and raised them from their  dead state, saying to them, \"Why did you come up here?  Do you intend  to go into the garden, from which I brought you out?  It cannot be  today; but only when the covenant I have made with you is fulfilled.\"    2 Then Adam, when he heard the Word of God, and the fluttering of the  angels whom he did not see, but only heard the sound of them with his  ears, he and Eve cried, and said to the angels:--    3 \"O Spirits, who wait on God, look at me, and at my being unable to  see you!  For when I was in my former bright nature, then I could see  you.  I sang praises as you do; and my heart was far above you.    4 But now, that I have transgressed, that bright nature is gone from  me, and I am come to this miserable state.  And now I have come to  this, that I cannot see you, and you do not serve me like you used to  do.  For I have become animal flesh.    5 Yet now, O angels of God, ask God with me, to restore me to that  wherein I was formerly; to rescue me from this misery, and to remove  from me the sentence of death He passed on me, for having trespassed  against Him.\"    6 Then, when the angels heard these words, they all grieved over him;  and cursed Satan who had misled Adam, until he came from the garden to  misery; from life to death; from peace to trouble; and from gladness to  a strange land.    7 Then the angels said to Adam, \"You obeyed Satan, and ignored the Word  of God who created you; and you believed that Satan would fulfil all he  had promised you.    8 But now, O Adam, we will make known to you, what came over us though  him, before his fall from heaven.    9 He gathered together his hosts, and deceived them, promising to give  them a great kingdom, a divine nature; and other promises he made them.    10 His hosts believed that his word was true, so they yielded to him,  and renounced the glory of God.    11 He then sent for us--according to the orders in which we were--to  come under his command, and to accept his vein promise.  But we would  not, and we did not take his advice.    12 Then after he had fought with God, and had dealt forwardly with Him,  he gathered together his hosts, and made war with us.  And if it had  not been for God's strength that was with us, we could not have  prevailed against him to hurl him from heaven.    13 But when he fell from among us, there was great joy in heaven,  because of his going down from us.  For if he had remained in heaven,  nothing, not even one angel would have remained"]]]
