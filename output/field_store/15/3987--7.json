I cannot leave you.\"    \"I will take care of myself,\" said Laili; \"but this man is so wicked,  he may kill you again if you are near him.\" So Majnun got up on the  horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili.  Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and  she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine  came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife  had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began  to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who  tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband,  and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's  palace.    [Illustration: How Loving Laili became young again]    There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified  and angry. \"How lucky for you that you have such a wife,\" he said.  \"Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now  dead.\" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's  safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much  of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he  built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of  ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and  heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but  their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not  allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; \"for,\" said King Dantal,  \"Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take  her away.\"          The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal    [Illustration:]      Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to  get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when  he failed.    By chance a poor Brahman came by. \"Let me out of this cage, oh pious  one!\" cried the tiger.    \"Nay, my friend,\" replied the Brahman mildly, \"you would probably eat  me if I did.\"    \"Not at all!\" swore the tiger with many oaths; \"on the contrary, I  should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!\"    Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious  Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of  the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried,  \"What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after  being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!\"    In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a  promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to  question as to the justice of the tiger's action.    So the Brahman first asked a _pipal_ tree what it thought of the  matter, but the _pipal_ tree replied coldly, \"What have you to  complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes  by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their  cattle? Don't whimper--be a man!\"    Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a  buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it  answered, \"You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I  gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry  they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!\"    The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion.    \"My dear sir,\" said the road, \"how foolish you are to expect anything  else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great  and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the  ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!\"    On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a  jackal, who called out, \"Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look  as miserable as a fish out of water!\"    The Brahman told him all that had occurred. \"How very confusing!\" said  the jackal, when the recital was ended; \"would you mind telling me  over again, for everything has got so mixed up?\"    The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a  distracted sort of way, and still could not understand.    \"It's very odd,\" said he, sadly, \"but it all seems to go in at one ear  and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened,  and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.\"    So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the  Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws.    \"You've been away a long time!\" growled the savage beast, \"but now let  us begin our dinner.\"    \"_Our_ dinner!\" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked  together with fright; \"what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!\"    \"Give me five minutes, my lord!\" he pleaded, \"in order that I may  explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.\"    The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again,  not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.    \"Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!\" cried the jackal, wringing its  paws. \"Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the  tiger came walking by----\"    \"Pooh!\" interrupted the tiger, \"what a fool you are! _I_ was in the  cage.\"    \"Of course!\" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright;  \"yes! I was in the cage--no I wasn't--dear! dear! where are my wits?  Let me see--the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking  by----no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your  dinner, for I shall never understand!\"    \"Yes, you shall!\" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's  stupidity; \"I'll _make_ you understand! Look here--I am the tiger----\"    \"Yes, my lord!\"    \"And that is the Brahman----\"    \"Yes, my lord!\"    \"And that is the cage----\"    \"Yes, my lord!\"    \"And I was in the cage--do you understand?\"    \"Yes--no---- Please, my lord----\"    \"Well?\" cried the tiger impatiently.    \"Please, my lord!--how did you get in?\"    \"How!--why in the usual way, of course!\"    \"Oh, dear me!--my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't be  angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?\"    At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried,  \"This way! Now do you understand how it was?\"    \"Perfectly!\" grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, \"and  if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they  were!\"          The Soothsayer's Son      A soothsayer when on his deathbed wrote out the horoscope of his  second son, whose name was Gangazara, and bequeathed it to him as his  only property, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son. The  second son thought over the horoscope, and said to himself:    \"Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father  never failed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while he  was living; and how has he fixed my horoscope! 'FROM MY BIRTH  POVERTY!' Nor is that my only fate. 'FOR TEN YEARS, IMPRISONMENT'--a  fate harder than poverty; and what comes next? 'DEATH ON THE  SEA-SHORE'; which means that I must die away from home, far from  friends and relatives on a sea-coast. Now comes the most curious part  of the horoscope, that I am to 'HAVE SOME HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS!' What  this happiness is, is an enigma to me.\"    Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father  were over, took leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares.  He went by the middle of the Deccan, avoiding both the coasts, and  went on journeying and journeying for weeks and months, till at last  he reached the Vindhya mountains. While passing that desert he had to  journey for a couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of  life or vegetation. The little store of provision with which he was  provided for a couple of days, at last was exhausted. The chombu,  which he carried always full, filling it with the sweet water from the  flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat of the  desert. There was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water  to drink. Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out  of which he saw no means of escape. Still he thought within himself,  \"Surely my father's prophecy never proved untrue. I must survive this  calamity to find my death on some sea-coast.\" So thought he, and this  thought gave him strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop  of water somewhere to slake his dry throat.    At last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He  thought he could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the  string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he  let it down; it went some way and stopped, and the following words  came from the well: \"Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers, dying  here of hunger. For the last three days I have had nothing. Fortune  has sent you here. If you assist me now you will find a sure help in  me throughout your life. Do not think that I am a beast of prey. When  you have become my deliverer I will never touch you. Pray, kindly lift  me up.\" Gangazara thought: \"Shall I take him out or not? If I take him  out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that he  will not do. For my father's prophecy never came untrue. I must die on  a sea coast, and not by a tiger.\" Thus thinking, he asked the  tiger-king to hold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly did, and  he lifted him up slowly. The tiger reached the top of the well and  felt himself on safe ground. True to his word, he did no harm to  Gangazara. On the other hand, he walked round his patron three times,  and standing before him, humbly spoke the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/713"],[0,"Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions — Volume 2 (#11)"],[1,"and Tancred brought up the rear.    Kerbogha, aware at last that his enemy was not so despicable, took  vigorous measures to remedy his mistake, and, preparing himself to meet  the Christians in front, he despatched the Sultan Soliman, of Roum, to  attack them in the rear. To conceal this movement, he set fire to the  dried weeds and grass with which the ground was covered, and Soliman,  taking a wide circuit with his cavalry, succeeded, under cover of the  smoke, in making good his position in the rear. The battle raged  furiously in front; the arrows of the Turks fell thick as hail, and  their well-trained squadrons trod the crusaders under their hoofs like  stubble. Still the affray was doubtful; for the Christians had the  advantage of the ground, and were rapidly gaining upon the enemy, when  the overwhelming forces of Soliman arrived in the rear.  Godfrey and  Tancred flew to the rescue of Bohemund, spreading dismay in the Turkish  ranks by their fierce impetuosity. The Bishop of Puy was left almost  alone with the Provencals to oppose the legions commanded by Kerbogha  in person; but the presence of the Holy Lance made a hero of the  meanest soldier in his train. Still, however, the numbers of the enemy  seemed interminable. The Christians, attacked on every side, began at  last to give way, and the Turks made sure of victory.    At this moment a cry was raised in the Christian host that the saints  were fighting on their side. The battle-field was clear of the smoke  from the burning weeds, which had curled away, and hung in white clouds  of fantastic shape on the brow of the distant mountains. Some  imaginative zealot, seeing this dimly through the dust of the battle,  called out to his fellows, to look at the army of saints, clothed in  white, and riding upon white horses, that were pouring over the hills  to the rescue. All eyes were immediately turned to the distant smoke;  faith was in every heart; and the old battle-cry, God wills it! God  wills it! resounded through the field, as every soldier, believing that  God was visibly sending His armies to his aid, fought with an energy  unfelt before. A panic seized the Persian and Turkish hosts, and they  gave way in all directions. In vain Kerbogha tried to rally them. Fear  is more contagious than enthusiasm, and they fled over the mountains  like deer pursued by the hounds. The two leaders, seeing the  uselessness of further efforts, fled with the rest; and that immense  army was scattered over Palestine, leaving nearly seventy thousand of  its dead upon the field of battle.    Their magnificent camp fell into the hands of the enemy, with its rich  stores of corn, and its droves of sheep and oxen. Jewels, gold, and  rich velvets in abundance were distributed among the army. Tancred  followed the fugitives over the hills, and reaped as much plunder as  those who had remained in the camp. The way, as they fled, was covered  with valuables, and horses of the finest breed of Arabia became so  plentiful, that every knight of the Christians was provided with a  steed. The crusaders, in this battle, acknowledge to have lost nearly  ten thousand men.    Their return to Antioch was one of joy indeed: the citadel was  surrendered at once, and many of the Turkish garrison embraced the  Christian faith, and the rest were suffered to depart. A solemn  thanksgiving was offered up by the Bishop of Puy, in which the whole  army joined, and the Holy Lance was visited by every soldier.    The enthusiasm lasted for some days, and the army loudly demanded to be  led forward to Jerusalem, the grand goal of all their wishes: but none  of their leaders was anxious to move;--the more prudent among them,  such as Godfrey and Tancred, for reasons of expediency; and the more  ambitious, such as the Count of Toulouse and Bohemund, for reasons of  self-interest. Violent dissensions sprang up again between all the  chiefs. Raymond of Toulouse, who was left at Antioch to guard the town,  had summoned the citadel to surrender, as soon as he saw that there was  no fear of any attack upon the part of the Persians; and the other  chiefs found, upon their return, his banner waving on its walls. This  had given great offence to Bohemund, who had stipulated the  principality of Antioch as his reward for winning the town in the first  instance. Godfrey and Tancred supported his claim, and, after a great  deal of bickering, the flag of Raymond was lowered from the tower, and  that of Bohemund hoisted in its stead, who assumed from that time the  title of Prince of Antioch. Raymond, however, persisted in retaining  possession of one of the city gates and its adjacent towers, which he  held for several months, to the great annoyance of Bohemund and the  scandal of the army. The Count became in consequence extremely  unpopular, although his ambition was not a whit more unreasonable than  that of Bohemund himself, nor of Baldwin, who had taken up his quarters  at Edessa, where he exercised the functions of a petty sovereign.    The fate of Peter Barthelemy deserves to be recorded. Honours and  consideration had come thick upon him after the affair of the lance,  and he consequently felt bound in conscience to continue the dreams  which had made him a personage of so much importance. The mischief of  it was, that like many other liars he had a very bad memory, and he  contrived to make his dreams contradict each other in the most palpable  manner. St. John one night appeared to him, and told one tale, while, a  week after, St. Paul told a totally different story, and held out hopes  quite incompatible with those of his apostolic brother. The credulity  of that age had a wide maw, and Peter's visions must have been absurd  and outrageous indeed, when the very men who had believed in the lance  refused to swallow any more of his wonders.  Bohemund at last, for the  purpose of annoying the Count of Toulouse, challenged poor Peter to  prove the truth of his story of the lance by the fiery ordeal. Peter  could not refuse a trial so common in that age, and being besides  encouraged by the Count and his chaplain, Raymond, an early day was  appointed for the ceremony. The previous night was spent in prayer and  fasting, according to custom, and Peter came forth in the morning  bearing the lance in his hand, and walked boldly up to the fire. The  whole army gathered round, impatient for the result, many thousands  still believing that the lance was genuine and Peter a holy man.  Prayers having been said by Raymond d'Agilles, Peter walked into the  flames, and had got nearly through, when pain caused him to lose his  presence of mind: the heat too affected his eyes, and, in his anguish,  he turned round unwittingly, and passed through the fire again, instead  of stepping out of it, as he should have done. The result was, that he  was burned so severely, that he never recovered, and, after lingering  for some days, he expired in great agony.    Most of the soldiers were suffering either from wounds, disease, or  weariness, and it was resolved by Godfrey,--the tacitly acknowledged  chief of the enterprize,--that the army should have time to refresh  itself ere they advanced upon Jerusalem. It was now July, and he  proposed that they should pass the hot months of August and September  within the walls of Antioch, and march forward in October with renewed  vigour, and numbers increased by fresh arrivals from Europe. This  advice was finally adopted, although the enthusiasts of the army  continued to murmur at the delay. In the mean time the Count of  Vermandois was sent upon an embassy to the Emperor Alexius at  Constantinople, to reproach him for his base desertion of the cause,  and urge him to send the reinforcements he had promised. The Count  faithfully executed his mission, (of which, by the way, Alexius took no  notice whatever,) and remained for some time at Constantinople, till  his zeal, never very violent, totally evaporated. He then returned to  France, sick of the Crusade, and determined to intermeddle with it no  more.    The chiefs, though they had determined to stay at Antioch for two  months, could not remain quiet for so long a time. They would, in all  probability, have fallen upon each other, had there been no Turks in  Palestine upon whom they might vent their impetuosity. Godfrey  proceeded to Edessa, to aid his brother Baldwin in expelling the  Saracens from his principality, and the other leaders carried on  separate hostilities against them as caprice or ambition dictated. At  length the impatience of the army to be led against Jerusalem became so  great that the chiefs could no longer delay, and Raymond, Tancred, and  Robert of Normandy marched forward with their divisions, and laid siege  to the small but strong town of Marah. With their usual improvidence,  they had not food enough to last a beleaguering army for a week. They  suffered great privations in consequence, till Bohemund came to their  aid and took the town by storm. In connexion with this siege, the  chronicler, Raymond d'Agilles, (the same Raymond, the chaplain, who  figured in the affair of the Holy Lance,) relates a legend, in the  truth of which he devoutly believed, and upon which Tasso has founded  one of the most beautiful passages of his poem. It is worth preserving,  as showing the spirit of the age and the source of the extraordinary  courage manifested by the crusaders on occasions of extreme difficulty.  \"One day,\" says Raymond, \"Anselme de Ribeaumont beheld young Engelram,  the son of the Count de St. Paul, who had been killed at Marsh, enter  his tent. 'How is it,' said Anselme to him, 'that you, whom I saw lying  dead on the field of battle, are full of life?'--'You must know,'  replied Engelram, 'that those who fight for Jesus Christ never  die.'--'But whence,' resumed Anselme, 'comes that strange brightness  that surrounds you?'
