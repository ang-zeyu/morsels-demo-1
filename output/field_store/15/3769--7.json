Thus Johannes Mueller says, \"The idea  of development is not that of mere increase of size, but that of  progress from what is not yet distinguished, but which potentially  contains the distinction in itself, to the actually distinct. It is  clear that the less an organ is developed, so much the more does it  approach the type, and that during its development it acquires more and  more peculiarities. The types discovered by comparative anatomy and  developmental history must therefore agree.\" And again, \"What is true in  this idea is, that every embryo at first bears only the type of its  section, from which the type of the class, order, &c., is only  afterwards developed.\" Agassiz also observes that \"the embryos of  different animals resemble each other the more the younger they are.\"    There are, no doubt, cases in which the earlier states are rapidly  passed through, or but obscurely indicated; yet we may almost state it  as a general proposition, that either before or after birth animals  undergo metamorphoses. The state of development of the young animal at  birth varies immensely. The kangaroo (_Macropus major_), which attains a  height of seven feet ten inches, does not when born exceed one inch and  two lines in length; the chick leaves the egg in a much more advanced  condition than the thrush; and so, among insects, the young cricket is  much more highly developed, when it leaves the egg, than the larva of  the fly or of the bee; and, as I have already mentioned, differences  occur even within the limit of one species, though not of course to  anything like the same extent.    In oviparous animals the condition of the young at birth depends much on  the size of the egg: where the egg is large, the abundant supply of  nourishment enables the embryo to attain a high stage of development;  where the egg is small, and the yolk consequently scanty, the embryo  requires an additional supply of food before it can do so. In the former  case the embryo is more likely to survive; but when the eggs are large,  they cannot be numerous, and a multiplicity of germs may be therefore in  some circumstances a great advantage. Even in the same species the  development of the egg presents certain differences.[43]    The metamorphoses of insects depend then primarily on the fact that the  young quit the egg at a more or less early stage of development; and  that consequently the external forces, acting upon them in this state,  are very different from those by which they are affected when they  arrive at maturity.    Hence it follows that, while in many instances mature forms, differing  greatly from one another, arise from very similar larvae, in other cases,  as we have seen, among some the parasitic Hymenoptera, insects agreeing  closely with one another, are produced from larvae which are very unlike.  The same phenomenon occurs in other groups. Thus, while in many cases  very dissimilar jelly-fishes arise from almost identical Hydroids, we  have also the reverse of the proposition in the fact that in some  species, Hydroids of an entirely distinct character produce very similar  Medusae.[44]    We may now pass to the second part of our subject: the apparent  suddenness and abruptness of the changes which insects undergo during  metamorphosis. But before doing so I must repeat that these changes are  not always, even apparently, sudden and great. The development of an  Orthopterous insect, say a grasshopper, from its leaving the egg to  maturity, is so gradual that the ordinary nomenclature of entomological  works (larva state and pupa state) does not apply to it; and even in the  case of Lepidoptera, the change from the caterpillar to the chrysalis  and from this to the butterfly is in reality less rapid than might at  first sight be supposed; the internal organs are metamorphosed very  gradually, and even the sudden and striking change in external form is  very deceptive, consisting merely of a throwing off of the outer  skin--the drawing aside, as it were of a curtain and the revelation of a  form which, far from being new, has been in preparation for days;  sometimes even for months.    Swammerdam, indeed, supposed (and his view was adopted by Kirby and  Spence) that the larva contained within itself \"the germ of the future  butterfly, enclosed in what will be the case of the pupa, which is  itself included in three or more skins, one over the other, that will  successively cover the larva.\" This was a mistake; but it is true that,  if a larva be examined shortly before it is full grown, the future pupa  may be traced within it. In the same manner, if we examine a pupa which  is about to disclose the butterfly, we find the future insect, soft  indeed and imperfect, but still easily recognizable, lying more or less  loosely within the pupa-skin.    One important difference between an insect and a vertebrate animal is,  that whereas in the latter--as, for instance, in ourselves--the muscles  are attached to an internal bony skeleton, in insects no such skeleton  exists. They have no bones, and their muscles are attached to the skin;  whence the necessity for the hard and horny dermal investment of  insects, so different from the softness and suppleness of our own skin.  The chitine, or horny substance, of which the outside of an insect  consists, is formed by a layer of cells lying beneath it, and, once  secreted, cannot be altered. From this the result is, that without a  change of skin, a change of form is impossible. In some cases, as for  instance in _Chloeon_, each change of skin is accompanied by a change of  form, and thus the perfect insect is gradually evolved. In others, as in  caterpillars, several changes of skin take place without any material  alteration of form, and the change, instead of being spread over many,  is confined to the last two moults.    One explanation of this difference between the larvae which change their  form with every change of skin, and those which do not, is, I believe,  to be found in the structure of the mouth. That of the caterpillar is  provided with a pair of strong jaws, fitted to eat leaves; and the  digestive organs are adapted for this kind of food. On the contrary, the  mouth of the butterfly is suctorial; it has a long proboscis,  beautifully adapted to suck the nectar from flowers, but which would be  quite useless, and indeed only an embarrassment to the larva. The  digestive organs also of the butterfly are adapted for the assimilation,  not of leaves, but of honey. Now it is evident that if the mouth-parts  of the larva were slowly metamorphosed into those of the perfect insect,  through a number of small changes, the insect would in the meantime be  unable to feed, and liable to perish of starvation in the midst of  plenty. In the Orthoptera, and among those insects in which the changes  are gradual, the mouth of the so-called larva resembles that of the  perfect insect, and the principal difference consists in the presence of  wings.    Similar considerations throw much light on the nature of the chrysalis  or pupa state--that remarkable period of death-like quiescence which is  one of the most striking characteristics of insect metamorphosis. The  quiescence of the pupa is mainly owing to the rapidity of the changes  going on in it. In that of a butterfly, not only (as has been already  mentioned) are the mouth and the digestive organs undergoing change, but  the muscles are in a similar state of transition. The powerful ones  which move the wings are in process of formation; and even the nervous  system, by which the movements are set on foot and regulated, is in a  state of rapid change.[45]    It must not be forgotten that all insects are inactive for a longer or  shorter space of time after each moult. The slighter the change, as a  general rule, the shorter is the period of inaction. Thus, after the  ordinary moult of a caterpillar, the insect only requires a short rest  until the new skin is hardened. When, however, the change is great, the  period of inaction is correspondingly prolonged. Most pupae indeed have  some slight powers of motion; those which assume the chrysalis state in  wood or beneath the ground usually come to the surface when about to  assume the perfect state, and the aquatic pupae of certain Diptera swim  about with much activity. Among the Neuroptera, certain families have  pupae as quiescent as those of the Lepidoptera: others--as, for  instance, _Raphidia_--are quiescent at first, but at length acquire  sufficient strength to walk, though still enclosed within the pupa-skin:  a power dependent partly on the fact that this skin is very thin. Others  again--as, for instance, dragon-flies--are not quiescent on assuming the  so-called pupa state for any longer time than at their other changes of  skin. The inactivity of the pupa is therefore not a new condition  peculiar to this stage, but a prolongation of the inaction which has  accompanied every previous change of skin.    Nevertheless the metamorphoses of insects have always seemed to me one  of the greatest difficulties of the Darwinian theory. In most cases, the  development of the individual reproduces to a certain extent that of the  race; but the motionless, imbecile pupa cannot represent a mature form.  No one, so far as I know, has yet attempted to explain, in accordance  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#11)"],[1,"a fine bird's eye-view of the surrounding hunting  ground, are favourite points {81} of vantage for both shrikes. When it  is time to husk the corn, every farmer's boy must have seen a shrike  sitting on a fence-rail or hovering in the air ready to seize the  little meadow mice that escape from the shocks.    It is sad to record that sometimes shrikes also sneak upon their prey.  When they resort to this mean method of securing a dinner they leave  the high perches and secrete themselves in clumps of bushes in the  open field. Luring little birds within striking distance by imitating  their call notes, they pounce upon a terror-stricken sparrow before  you could say \"Jack Robinson.\" Shrikes seem to be the only creatures  that really rejoice in the rapid increase of English sparrows. In  summer they prefer large insects, especially grasshoppers, but in  winter when they can get none, they must have the fresh meat of birds  or mice. At any season they deserve the fullest protection for the  service they do the farmer. Shrikes kill only that they themselves may  live, and not for the sake of slaughter, which is a so-called sport  reserved for man alone, who in any case, should be the last creature  to condemn them.    The loggerhead's call-notes are harsh, creaking, and unpleasant, but  at the approach of the nesting season he proves that he really can  sing, although not half as well as his cousin, the northern shrike,  who astonishes us with a fine {82} song some morning in early spring.  Before we become familiar with it, however, the wandering minstrel is  off to the far north to nest within the arctic circle. It is only in  winter that the northern shrike visits the United States, travelling  as far south as Virginia and Kansas between October and April. He is  larger than the loggerhead, being a little over ten inches long, a  goodlooking winter visitor in a gray suit with black and white  trimmings on his wings and tail and wavy bars on his breast. Bradford  Torrey used to visit a vireo that would drink water from a teaspoon  which he held out to her while she sat brooding on her nest. I know a  lady who fed bits of raw meat to a wounded shrike from the tines of a  fork, the best substitute for a thorn she could find, because he found  it awkward to eat from a dish.      THE CEDAR WAXWING    _Called also: Cedarbird; Cherry-bird; Bonnet bird, Silk-tail._    So few birds wear their head feathers crested that it is a simple  matter to name them by their top-knots alone, even if you did not see  the gray plumage of the little tufted titmouse, the dusky hue of the  crested flycatcher, the blue {83} of the jay and the kingfisher, the  red of the cardinal, and the richly shaded grayish-brown of the cedar  waxwing, which is, perhaps, the most familiar of them all. His neat  and well-groomed plumage is fine and very silky, almost dove-like in  colouring, and although there are no gaudy features about it, few of  our birds are so exquisitely dressed. The pointed crest, which rises  and falls to express every passing emotion, and the velvety black  chin, forehead, and line running apparently through the eye, give  distinction to the head. The tail has a narrow yellow band across its  end, and on the wings are the small red spots like sealing wax that  are responsible for the bird's queer name. The waxwing is larger than  a sparrow and smaller than a robin.    But it is difficult to think of a single bird when one usually sees a  flock. Sociable to a degree, the waxwings rove about a neighbourhood  in scattered companies, large and small, to feed on the cedar or  juniper berries, choke-cherries, dog-wood and woodbine berries, elder,  haw, and other small wild fruits on which they feed very greedily;  then move on to some other place where their favourite fruit abounds.  Happily, they care very little about our cultivated fruit and rarely  touch it. A good way to invite many kinds of birds to visit one's  neighbourhood is to plant plenty of {84} berry-bearing trees and  shrubs. The birds themselves plant most of the wild ones, by dropping  the undigested berry seeds far and wide. How could the seeds of many  species be distributed over thousands of miles of land without their  help? It will surprise you to count the number of trees about your  home that have been planted, quite unconsciously, by birds many years  before you were born. Cedarbirds are responsible for no small part of  the beauty of the lanes and hedgerows throughout their wide range from  sea to sea and from Canada to Mexico and Central America. Nature, you  see, makes her creatures work for her, whether they know they are  helping her plans or not.    When a flock of cedarbirds enters your neighbourhood, there is no  noisy warning of their coming. Gentle, refined in manners, courteous  to one another, almost silent visitors, they will sit for hours nearly  motionless in a tree while digesting a recent feast. An occasional  bird may shift his position, then, politely settling himself again  without disturbing the rest of the company, remain quiet as before.  Lisping, _Twee-twee-zee_ call notes, like a hushed whispered whistle,  are the only sounds the visitors make. How different from a roving  flock of screaming, boisterous blue jays!      [Illustration]    The cedar waxwing      [Illustration]    The gorgeous scarlet tanager who sang in this tree was killed by a  sling-shot. The nest was deserted by his terrified mate.    {85}    When rising to take wing, the squad still keeps together, flying  evenly and swiftly in close ranks on a level with the tree-tops along  a straight course; or, wheeling suddenly, the birds dive downward into  a promising, leafy, restaurant. Enormous numbers of insects are  consumed by a flock. The elm-beetle, which destroys the beauty, if not  the life, of some of our finest shade trees, would be exterminated if  there were cedarbirds enough. One flock within a week rid a New  England village of this pest that had eaten the leaves on the double  row of elms which had been the glory of its broad main street for over  a hundred years. When you see these birds in an orchard, look for  better apples there next year. Canker-worms are a _bon bouche_ to  them; so are grubs and caterpillars, especially cutworms.    Sometime after all the other birds, except the tardy little goldfinch,  have nested, the waxwings give up the flocking habit and live in  pairs. Toward the end of June, when many birds are rearing the second  brood, you may see a couple begin to carry grass, shreds of bark,  twine, fine roots, catkins, moss or rags--any or all of these building  materials--to some tree, usually a fruit tree or a cedar; and then, if  you watch carefully, you will find what is not always the case with  humans--the birds' manners at home are even better than when moving in  society abroad. The devoted male brings dainties to his brooding mate  and helps her feed {86} their family. Moreover, cedarbirds are very  good to feathered orphans.      THE SCARLET TANAGER    _Called also: Black-winged Redbird_    People who are now living can remember when scarlet tanagers were as  common as robins. Where are they now? You see a redbird at the north  so rarely that a thrill of excitement is felt when a flash of scarlet  among the tree-tops makes the day a red-letter one on your bird  calendar. Alas! He has, what has certainly proved to be, the fatal  gift of beauty. A scarlet coat with black wings and tail, worn by a  bird larger than a sparrow, makes a shining mark among the foliage for  the shot gun and sling shot. Thousands of tanagers have been  slaughtered to be worn on the unthinking heads of vain girls and  women. Many are killed every year, during the spring and autumn  migrations, by flying against the great lighthouses along our coasts,  the birds' highway of travel. Tanagers, who are only summer visitors  from the tropics, are peculiarly susceptible to cold; a sudden change  in the weather, a drop in the thermometer some time in May just after  they have come here from a warmer {87} climate and are still  especially sensitive, will kill off great numbers in the north woods  and in Canada. They really should postpone their journey a little  while until the weather becomes settled and there are fewer fogs on  the coast.    The male tanager, in his wedding garment, is sometimes mistaken for a  cardinal by people who only half see any object they look at. Bird  study sharpens the sight wonderfully, and teaches boys and girls the  importance of accurate observation. The cardinal, a larger bird, is  almost as large as a robin; he is a rich, deep red all over, and not a  scarlet shade. Moreover he wears a pointed crest by which you may  always know him, while the tanager, whose head is smooth, may be  certainly named by his black wings and tail. After the nesting season,  the tanager begins to moult and then he is a queer looking object  indeed in his motley coat. Only little patches and streaks of scarlet  remain here and there among the olive green feathers that gradually  replace the red ones until, in winter, he becomes completely  transformed into an olive bird with black wings, looking like his  immature sons. How tiresome to have to change his feathers again  toward spring before he can hope to woo and win a mate!    The exacting little lady bird, who demands such fine feathers, is  herself quietly clad in light olive green with a more yellowish tinge  on her {88} lighter breast that she may be in perfect colour harmony  with the leaves she lives and nests among. If she, too, wore scarlet,  I fear the tanager tribe would have disappeared years ago. Happily her  protective colouring, which betrays no nest secrets, has saved the  species. Is it not strange that birds, who spend the rest of their  lives among the tree-tops, hunting among the foliage for insects and  small fruit, should nest so low? Sometimes they place their cradle on  a"]]]
