Even to the present day in Egypt, although  sister-marriage has disappeared, yet it is the duty of a man to marry  his first cousin or some one in the family. The very idea of  relationship being any possible impediment to marriage was un-thought of  by the Egyptian; his favourite concrete expression for a self-existent  or self-created being--\"husband of his mother \"--shows this unmistakably.    The objection made by the king to the marriage of Na-nefer-ka-ptah and  Ahura turns on the point that he has only these two children, and hence,  if they marry the children of the generals, there will be two families  instead of only one to ensure future posterity. The queen, however,  talks the king over on the matter. The cause of Ahura's being troubled  at the feast is not certain, but the king evidently supposes that she  has been pleading to be allowed to marry her beloved brother, and when  taxed with it she only expresses her willingness to give way to his  exogamic views. The brief sentence, \"I laughed and the king laughed,\"  seems to mean that she pleased and amused her father so that he gave  way, and immediately told the steward to arrange for her marriage as she  desired. I have here abbreviated a few needlessly precise details. We  also learn, by the way, that there was a regular registry of births, in  which Mer-ab was entered.    It appears that the court was considered to be at Memphis, and not at  Thebes. This would not have been so arranged had this been written in  the Ramesside times, but under the Ptolemies Memphis was the seat of the  court--when not at Alexandria. The name of the priest, Nesi-ptah, also  shows another anachronism. Such a name was not usual till some time  after the XIXth Dynasty. Another touch of late times is in the  antiquarian curiosity of Na-nefer-ka-ptah about ancient writings, \"He  did nothing on earth but read the writings that are in the catacombs of  the kings, and the tablets of the House of Life.\" In the XIXth Dynasty  there is no sign of interest in such records, but in the Renascence  ancient things came into fashion, all the old titles were revived, the  old style was copied, and very long genealogies were worked up and  carved in the inscriptions. In such an age many a _dilettante_ rich  young man would amuse himself, as in this tale, with reading inscriptions  and hunting up his family genealogy from the tombstones and the registers.    The firm belief in magic which underlies all this tale might perhaps be  thought to be inappropriate to the enlightenment of Greek times. We have  seen how in the earliest tales magic is a mainspring of the action, and  it is at first sight surprising that its sway should last through so  many thousands of years. But there may well have been a recrudescence of  such beliefs, along with the revival of interest in the earlier history.  The enormous spread and popularity of Gnosticism--the belief in the  efficacy of words and formulas to control spirits and their actions--in  the centuries immediately after this, shows how ingrained magic ideas  were, and how ready to sprout up when the counterbalancing interests of  the old mythology were gone, and their place taken by the intangible  spirituality of Platonism and the early Christian atmosphere.    A most Egyptian turn is given where the priest bargains for a large  payment for his funeral, and to be buried as a rich priest. The  enclosing of the magic roll in a series of boxes has many parallels. In  an Indian tale we read: \"Round the tree are tigers and bears and  scorpions and snakes; on the top of the tree is a very fat great snake;  on his head is a little cage; in the cage is a bird; and my soul is in  that bird\" (\"Golden Bough,\" ii. 300). In Celtic tales the series-idea  also occurs. The soul of a giant is in an egg, the egg is in a dove, the  dove is in a hare, the hare is in a wolf, and the wolf is in an iron  chest at the bottom of the sea (\"Golden Bough,\" ii. 314). The Tartars  have stories of a golden casket containing the soul, inside a copper or  silver casket (\"Golden Bough,\" ii. 324). And the Arabs tell of a soul  put in the crop of a sparrow, and the sparrow in a little box, and this  in another small box, and this put into seven other boxes, and these in  seven chests, and the chest in a coffer of marble (\"Golden 10  Bough,\" ii. 318). The notion, therefore, of a series of boxes, one  enclosing another, and the whole guarded by dangerous animals, is well  known as an element in tales. The late date is here shown by the largest  and least precious of the boxes being of iron, which was rarely, if  ever, used in Ramesside times, and was not common till the Greek age.    The magic engineering of Na-nefer-ka-ptah is very curious. The cabin or  air-chamber of men in model, who are let down to work for him, suggests  that Egyptians may have used the principle of a diving-bell or  air-chamber for reaching parts under water. Certainly the device of  raising things by dropping down sand to be put under them is still  practised. An immense sarcophagus at Gizeh was raised from a deep well  by natives who thrust sand under it rammed tight by a stick, and by this  simple kind of hydraulic press raised it a hundred feet to the surface.  In this way the magic men of Na-nefer-ka-ptah raised up the chest when  they had discovered it by means of the sand which he poured over from  the boat.    There is some picturesqueness in this tale, though it has not the charm  of the earlier compositions. The scene of Ahura sitting for three days  and nights, during the combat, watching by the side of the river, where  she \"had not drunk or eaten anything, and had done nothing on earth but  sat like one who is gone to the grave,\" is a touching detail.    The light on the education of women is curious. Ahura can read the roll,  but she cannot write. We are so accustomed to regard reading and writing  as all one subject that the distinction is rare; but with a writing  comprising so many hundred signs as the Egyptian, the art of writing or  draw-Ing all the forms, and knowing which to use, is far more complex  than that of reading. There are now ten students who can read an  inscription for one who could compose it correctly. Here a woman of the  highest rank is supposed to be able to read, but not to write; that is  reserved for the skill of \"a good writer, and a very learned one.\"    The writing of spells and then washing the ink off and drinking it is a  familiar idea in the East. Modern Egyptian bowls have charms engraved on  them to be imparted to the drink, and ancient Babylonian bowls are  inscribed with the like purpose.    An insight into the powers of the gods is here given us. The Egyptian  did not attribute to them omniscience. Thoth only discovered what  Na-nefer-ka-ptah had done as they were sailing away, some days after the  seizure of the book. And even Ra is informed by the complaint of Thoth.  If Ra were the physical sun it would be obvious that he would see all  that was being done on earth; it would rather be he who would inform  Thoth. The conception of the gods must therefore have been not  pantheistic or materialist, but solely as spiritual powers who needed to  obtain information, and who only could act through intermediaries.  Further, nothing can be done without the consent of Ra; Thoth is  powerless over men, and can only ask Ra, as a sort of universal  magistrate, to take notice of the offence. Neither god acts directly,  but by means of a power or angel, who takes the commission to work on  men. How far this police-court conception of the gods is due to Greek or  foreign influence can hardly be estimated yet. It certainly does not  seem in accord with the earlier appeals to Ra, and direct action of Ra,  in \"Anpu and Bata.\"    The power of spells is limited, as we have just seen the abilities of  the gods were limited. The most powerful of spells, the magic book of  Thoth himself, cannot restore life to a person just drowned. All that  Na-nefer-ka-ptah can do with the spell is to cause the body to float  and to speak, but it remains so truly dead that it is buried as if no  spell had been used. Now it was recognised that the _ka_ could move  about and speak to living persons, as Ahura does to Setna. Hence all  that the spells do is not to alter the course of nature, but only to put  the person into touch and communication with the ever-present  supernatural, to enable him to know what the birds, the fishes, and the  beasts all said, and to see the unseen.    Modern conceptions of the spiritual are so bound up with the sense of  omnipresence and omniscience that we are apt to read those ideas into  the gods and the magic of the ancients. Here we have to deal with gods  who have to obtain information, and who order powers to act for them,  with spells which extend the senses to the unseen, but which do not  affect natural results and changes.    The inexorable fate in this tale which brings one after another of the  family to die in the same spot is not due to Greek influence, though it  seems akin to that. In the irrepressible transmigrations of Bata, and  the successive risks of the Doomed Prince, the same ideas are seen  working in the Egyptian mind. The remorse of Na-nefer-ka-ptah is a  stronger touch of conscience and of shame than is seen in early times.    There is an unexplained point in the action as to how Na-nefer-ka-ptah,  with the book upon him, comes up from the water, after he is drowned,  into the cabin of the royal boat. The narrator had a difficulty to  account for the recovery of the body without the use of the magic book,  and so that stage is left unnoticed. The successive stages of embalming  and mourning are detailed. The sixteen days in the Good House is  probably the period of treatment of the body, the time up to the  thirty-fifth day that of wrapping and decoration of the mummy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7423"],[0,"Mike (#11)"],[1," school.\"    \"By Jove, nor could they! I say!\"    They walked on, Neville-Smith's mind in a whirl, Wyatt whistling.    \"I say,\" said Neville-Smith after a pause. \"It would be a bit of a  rag.\"    \"Not bad.\"    \"Do you think the chaps would do it?\"    \"If they understood they wouldn't be alone.\"    Another pause.    \"Shall I ask some of them?\" said Neville-Smith.    \"Do.\"    \"I could get quite a lot, I believe.\"    \"That would be a start, wouldn't it? I could get a couple of dozen  from Wain's. We should be forty or fifty strong to start with.\"    \"I say, what a score, wouldn't it be?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I'll speak to the chaps to-night, and let you know.\"    \"All right,\" said Wyatt. \"Tell them that I shall be going anyhow. I  should be glad of a little company.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The school turned in on the Thursday night in a restless, excited way.  There were mysterious whisperings and gigglings. Groups kept forming  in corners apart, to disperse casually and innocently on the approach  of some person in authority.    An air of expectancy permeated each of the houses.          CHAPTER X    THE GREAT PICNIC      Morning school at Wrykyn started at nine o'clock. At that hour there  was a call-over in each of the form-rooms. After call-over the forms  proceeded to the Great Hall for prayers.    A strangely desolate feeling was in the air at nine o'clock on the  Friday morning. Sit in the grounds of a public school any afternoon in  the summer holidays, and you will get exactly the same sensation of  being alone in the world as came to the dozen or so day-boys who  bicycled through the gates that morning. Wrykyn was a boarding-school  for the most part, but it had its leaven of day-boys. The majority of  these lived in the town, and walked to school. A few, however, whose  homes were farther away, came on bicycles. One plutocrat did the  journey in a motor-car, rather to the scandal of the authorities, who,  though unable to interfere, looked askance when compelled by the  warning toot of the horn to skip from road to pavement. A form-master  has the strongest objection to being made to skip like a young ram by  a boy to whom he has only the day before given a hundred lines for  shuffling his feet in form.    It seemed curious to these cyclists that there should be nobody about.  Punctuality is the politeness of princes, but it was not a leading  characteristic of the school; and at three minutes to nine, as a  general rule, you might see the gravel in front of the buildings  freely dotted with sprinters, trying to get in in time to answer their  names.    It was curious that there should be nobody about to-day. A wave of  reform could scarcely have swept through the houses during the night.    And yet--where was everybody?    Time only deepened the mystery. The form-rooms, like the gravel, were  empty.    The cyclists looked at one another in astonishment. What could it  mean?    It was an occasion on which sane people wonder if their brains are not  playing them some unaccountable trick.    \"I say,\" said Willoughby, of the Lower Fifth, to Brown, the only other  occupant of the form-room, \"the old man _did_ stop the holiday  to-day, didn't he?\"    \"Just what I was going to ask you,\" said Brown. \"It's jolly rum. I  distinctly remember him giving it out in hall that it was going to be  stopped because of the O.W.'s day row.\"    \"So do I. I can't make it out. Where _is_ everybody?\"    \"They can't _all_ be late.\"    \"Somebody would have turned up by now. Why, it's just striking.\"    \"Perhaps he sent another notice round the houses late last night,  saying it was on again all right. I say, what a swindle if he did.  Some one might have let us know. I should have got up an hour later.\"    \"So should I.\"    \"Hullo, here _is_ somebody.\"    It was the master of the Lower Fifth, Mr. Spence. He walked briskly  into the room, as was his habit. Seeing the obvious void, he stopped  in his stride, and looked puzzled.    \"Willoughby. Brown. Are you the only two here? Where is everybody?\"    \"Please, sir, we don't know. We were just wondering.\"    \"Have you seen nobody?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"We were just wondering, sir, if the holiday had been put on again,  after all.\"    \"I've heard nothing about it. I should have received some sort of  intimation if it had been.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Do you mean to say that you have seen _nobody_, Brown?\"    \"Only about a dozen fellows, sir. The usual lot who come on bikes,  sir.\"    \"None of the boarders?\"    \"No, sir. Not a single one.\"    \"This is extraordinary.\"    Mr. Spence pondered.    \"Well,\" he said, \"you two fellows had better go along up to Hall. I  shall go to the Common Room and make inquiries. Perhaps, as you say,  there is a holiday to-day, and the notice was not brought to me.\"    Mr. Spence told himself, as he walked to the Common Room, that  this might be a possible solution of the difficulty. He was not a  house-master, and lived by himself in rooms in the town. It was  just conceivable that they might have forgotten to tell him of the  change in the arrangements.    But in the Common Room the same perplexity reigned. Half a dozen  masters were seated round the room, and a few more were standing. And  they were all very puzzled.    A brisk conversation was going on. Several voices hailed Mr. Spence as  he entered.    \"Hullo, Spence. Are you alone in the world too?\"    \"Any of your boys turned up, Spence?\"    \"You in the same condition as we are, Spence?\"    Mr. Spence seated himself on the table.    \"Haven't any of your fellows turned up, either?\" he said.    \"When I accepted the honourable post of Lower Fourth master in this  abode of sin,\" said Mr. Seymour, \"it was on the distinct understanding  that there was going to be a Lower Fourth. Yet I go into my form-room  this morning, and what do I find? Simply Emptiness, and Pickersgill II.  whistling 'The Church Parade,' all flat. I consider I have been hardly  treated.\"    \"I have no complaint to make against Brown and Willoughby, as  individuals,\" said Mr. Spence; \"but, considered as a form, I call them  short measure.\"    \"I confess that I am entirely at a loss,\" said Mr. Shields precisely.  \"I have never been confronted with a situation like this since I  became a schoolmaster.\"    \"It is most mysterious,\" agreed Mr. Wain, plucking at his beard.  \"Exceedingly so.\"    The younger masters, notably Mr. Spence and Mr. Seymour, had begun to  look on the thing as a huge jest.    \"We had better teach ourselves,\" said Mr. Seymour. \"Spence, do a  hundred lines for laughing in form.\"    The door burst open.    \"Hullo, here's another scholastic Little Bo-Peep,\" said Mr. Seymour.  \"Well, Appleby, have you lost your sheep, too?\"    \"You don't mean to tell me----\" began Mr. Appleby.    \"I do,\" said Mr. Seymour. \"Here we are, fifteen of us, all good men  and true, graduates of our Universities, and, as far as I can see, if  we divide up the boys who have come to school this morning on fair  share-and-share-alike lines, it will work out at about two-thirds of a  boy each. Spence, will you take a third of Pickersgill II.?\"    \"I want none of your charity,\" said Mr. Spence loftily. \"You don't  seem to realise that I'm the best off of you all. I've got two in my  form. It's no good offering me your Pickersgills. I simply haven't  room for them.\"    \"What does it all mean?\" exclaimed Mr. Appleby.    \"If you ask me,\" said Mr. Seymour, \"I should say that it meant that  the school, holding the sensible view that first thoughts are best,  have ignored the head's change of mind, and are taking their holiday  as per original programme.\"    \"They surely cannot----!\"    \"Well, where are they then?\"    \"Do you seriously mean that the entire school has--has  _rebelled_?\"    \"'Nay, sire,'\" quoted Mr. Spence, \"'a revolution!'\"    \"I never heard of such a thing!\"    \"We're making history,\" said Mr. Seymour.    \"It will be rather interesting,\" said Mr. Spence, \"to see how the head  will deal with a situation like this. One can rely on him to do the  statesman-like thing, but I'm bound to say I shouldn't care to be in  his place. It seems to me these boys hold all the cards. You can't  expel a whole school. There's safety in numbers. The thing is  colossal.\"    \"It is deplorable,\" said Mr. Wain, with austerity. \"Exceedingly so.\"    \"I try to think so,\" said Mr. Spence, \"but it's a struggle. There's a  Napoleonic touch about the business that appeals to one. Disorder on a  small scale is bad, but this is immense. I've never heard of anything  like it at any public school. When I was at Winchester, my last year  there, there was pretty nearly a revolution because the captain of  cricket was expelled on the eve of the Eton match. I remember making  inflammatory speeches myself on that occasion. But we stopped on the  right side of the line. We were satisfied with growling. But this----!\"    Mr. Seymour got up.    \"It's an ill wind,\" he said. \"With any luck we ought to get the day  off, and it's ideal weather for a holiday. The head can hardly ask us  to sit indoors, teaching nobody. If I have to stew in my form-room all  day, instructing Pickersgill II., I shall make things exceedingly  sultry for that youth. He will wish that the Pickersgill progeny had  stopped short at his elder brother. He will not value life. In the  meantime, as it's already ten past, hadn't we better be going up to  Hall to see what the orders of the day _are_?\"    \"Look at Shields,\" said Mr. Spence. \"He might be posing for a statue  to be called 'Despair!' He reminds me of Macduff. _Macbeth_, Act  iv., somewhere near the end. 'What, all my pretty chickens, at one  fell swoop?' That's what Shields is saying to himself.\"    \"It's all very well to make a joke of it, Spence,\" said Mr. Shields  querulously, \"but it is most disturbing. Most.\"    \"Exceedingly,\" agreed Mr. Wain.    The bereaved company of masters walked on up the stairs that led to  the Great Hall.       "]]]
