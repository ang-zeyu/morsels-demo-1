The _dhurrie_ was trampled into the mud by clayey feet. Baggage had to  be disentangled and unpacked after dark, and the confusion apt to  prevail on the first night of a march was something terrible. It  opened my eyes to the thorough inefficiency of Hadji, who was so dazed  with opium this morning that he stood about in a dream, ejaculating  \"_Ya Allah!_\" when it was suggested that he should bestir himself,  leaving me to do all the packing, groaning as he took up the tent  pegs, and putting on the mule's bridle with the bit hanging under her  chin!    The night was very damp, not quite frosty, and in the dim morning the  tent and its contents were wet. Tea at seven, with Baghdad rusks, with  a distinctly \"native taste,\" two hours spent in standing about on the  damp, clayey ground till my feet were numb, while the men, most of  whom were complaining of rheumatism, stumbled through their new work;  and then five hours of wastes, enlivened by caravans of camels, mules,  horses, or asses, and sometimes of all mixed, with their wild, armed  drivers. The leader of each caravan carries a cylinder-shaped bell  under his throat, suspended from a red leather band stitched with  cowries, another at his chest, and very large ones, often twenty-four  inches long by ten in diameter, hanging from each pack. Every other  animal of the caravan has smaller bells, and the tones, which are  often most musical, reach from the deep note of a church bell up to  the frivolous jingle of sleigh bells; jingle often becomes jangle when  several caravans are together. The _katirgis_ (muleteers) spend large  sums on the bells and other decorations. Among the loads we met or  overtook were paraffin, oranges, pomegranates, carpets, cotton goods,  melons, grain, and chopped straw. The waste is covered with tracks,  and a guide is absolutely necessary.    The day has been still and very gloomy, with flakes of snow falling at  times. The passing over rich soil, once cultivated and populous, now  abandoned to the antelope and partridge, is most melancholy. The  remains of canals and water-courses, which in former days brought the  waters of the Tigris and the Diyalah into the fields of the great  grain-growing population of these vast levels of Chaldaea and  Mesopotamia, are everywhere, and at times create difficulties on the  road. By road is simply meant a track of greater or less width,  trodden on the soil by the passage of caravans for ages. On these two  marches not a stone has been seen which could strike a ploughshare.    Great ancient canals, with their banks in ruins and their deep beds  choked up and useless, have been a mournful feature of rather a dismal  day's journey. We crossed the bed of the once magnificent Nahrwan  canal, the finest of the ancient irrigation works to the east of the  Tigris, still in many places from twenty-five to forty feet deep and  from 150 to 200 feet in breadth.    For many miles the only permanent village is a collection of miserable  mud hovels round a forlorn caravanserai, in which travellers may find  a wretched refuge from the vicissitudes of weather. There is a  remarkable lack of shelter and provender, considering that this is not  only one of the busiest of caravan routes, but is enormously  frequented by Shiah pilgrims on their way from Persia to the shrines  of Kerbela.    After crossing the Nahrwan canal the road keeps near the right bank of  the Diyalah, a fine stream, which for a considerable distance runs  parallel with the Tigris at a distance of from ten to thirty miles  from it, and falls into it below Baghdad; and _imamzadas_ and villages  with groves of palms break the line of the horizon, while on the left  bank for fully two miles are contiguous groves of dates and  pomegranates. These groves are walled, and among them this  semi-decayed and ruinous town is situated, miserably shrunk from its  former proportions. We entered Yakobiyeh after crossing the Diyalah  by a pontoon bridge of twelve boats, and found one good house with  projecting lattice windows, and a large entrance over which the head  and ears of a hare were nailed; narrow, filthy lanes, a covered bazar,  very dark and ruinous, but fairly well supplied, an archway, and  within it this caravanserai in which the baggage must be waited for  for two hours.    This first experience of a Turkish inn is striking. There is a large  square yard, heaped with dirt and rubbish, round which are stables and  some dark, ruinous rooms. A broken stair leads to a flat mud roof, on  which are some narrow \"stalls,\"--_rooms_ they cannot be called,--with  rude doors fastening only from the outside, for windows small round  holes mostly stuffed with straw near the roof, for floors sodden  earth, for fireplaces holes in the same, the walls slimy and  unplastered, the corners full of ages of dusty cobwebs, both the walls  and the rafters of the roof black with ages of smoke, and beetles and  other abominations hurry into crannies, when the doors are opened, to  emerge as soon as they are shut. A small hole in the wall outside each  stall serves for cooking. The habits of the people are repulsive, foul  odours are only hybernating, and so, mercifully, are the vermin.    While waiting for the \"furniture\" which is to make my \"unfurnished  apartment\" habitable, I write sitting on my camp stool with its back  against the wall, wrapped up in a horse-blanket, a heap of saddles,  swords, holsters, and gear keeping the wind from my feet. The Afghan  orderly smokes at the top of the stair. Plumes of palms and  faintly-seen ridges of snowy hills appear over the battlements of the  roof. A snow wind blows keenly. My fingers are nearly numb, and I am  generally stiff and aching, but so much better that discomforts are  only an amusement. Snow is said to be impending. I have lunched  frugally on sheep's milk and dates, and feel everything but my present  surroundings to be very far off, and as if I had lived the desert  life, and had heard the chimes of the great caravans, and had seen the  wild desert riders, and the sun sinking below the level line of the  desert horizon, for two months instead of two days.    Yakobiyeh is said to have 800 houses. It has some small mosques and  several caravanserais, of which this is the best! It was once a  flourishing place, but repeated ravages of the plague and chronic  official extortions have reduced it to decay. Nevertheless, it grows  grain enough for its own needs on poorly irrigated soil, and in its  immense gardens apples, pears, apricots, walnuts, and mulberries  flourish alongside of the orange and palm.    _Kizil Robat, Jan. 14._--It was not very cold at Yakobiyeh. At home  few people would be able to sit in a fireless den, with the door open,  on a January night, but fireless though it was, my slender camp  equipage gave it a look of comfort, and though rats or mice ate a bag  of rusks during the night, and ran over my bed, there were no other  annoyances. Hadji grows more dazed and possibly more unwilling every  day, as he sees his vista of perquisites growing more limited, and to  get off, even at nine, I have to do the heavy as well as the light  packing myself.    There was a great \"row,\" arising out of an alleged delinquency of the  _katirgis_ concerning payment, when we left Yakobiyeh the following  morning. The owners of the caravanserai wanted to detain us, and the  archway was so packed with a shouting, gesticulating, scowling, and  not kindly crowd, mostly armed, that it was not easy for me to mount.  The hire of mules always includes their fodder and the keep of the  men, but in the first day or two the latter usually attempt to break  their bargain, and compel their employer to provide for them. So long  as Arabic is spoken Hadji acts as sole interpreter, and though  soldiers and _zaptiehs_ were left with him he was scared at being left  behind with the baggage. The people stormed and threatened at the top  of their voices, but doubtless it was not so bad as it sounded, for we  got through the bazars without molestation, and then into a perplexing  system of ancient water-courses whose high broken banks and deep  waterless beds intersect each other and the road. In contrast to this  magnificent irrigation system there are modern water-channels about a  foot wide, taken from the river Diyalah, which, small as they are,  turn the rich deep soil into a \"fruitful field.\"    After these glimpses of a prosperity which once was and might be again  (for these vast alluvial plains, which extend from the Zagros  mountains to the Euphrates and up to the Syrian desert, are capable  with irrigation and cultivation of becoming the granary of Western  Asia), the road emerges on a level and somewhat gravelly waste, on  which after a long ride we were overtaken by a _zaptieh_ sent by the  Persian agent in Yakobiyeh, to say that the baggage and servants were  being forcibly detained, but shortly afterwards with a good glass the  caravan was seen emerging from the town.    The country was nearly as featureless as on the preceding day, and on  the whole quite barren; among the few caravans on the road there were  two of immense value, the loads being the best description of Persian  carpets. There were a few families on asses, migrating with all their  possessions, and a few parties of Arab horsemen picturesquely and very  fully armed, but no dwellings, till in the bright afternoon sunshine,  on the dreariest stretch of an apparently verdureless waste, we came  on the caravanserai of Wiyjahea, a gateway with a room above it, a  square court with high walls and arched recesses all round for goods  and travellers, and large stables. A row of reed huts, another of Arab  tents, and a hovel opposite the gateway, where a man with two guns  within reach sells food, tobacco, and hair ropes, make up this place  of horror. For, indeed, the only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#11)"],[1," and every yard of land is  cultivated if water is procurable.    The hospitality which those two travellers mention as a feature of the  character of the more southerly Bakhtiaris does not exist among these  people. They have, in fact, little to be hospitable with. They all  speak of better days in the times of their fathers, when they had  brood mares and horses to ride, much pastoral wealth and plenty of  _roghan_, and when their women could wear jewels and strings of coins.    On this point I believe them, though there may possibly be  exaggeration in Taimur Khan's statements. Persia has undoubtedly  tightened her grip upon them, and she is sucking their life-blood out  of them. This becomes very evident now that we have reached a point  where the government of Burujird comes in, with the infinite  unrighteousness of Persian provincial governors. It is not the tribute  fixed by the Amin-es-Sultan which these Khans complain of, but the  rapacious exactions of the local governors.    There is a \"blood feud\" between Taimur Khan and Aslam Khan, the chief  of the Zalaki tribe, on whose territory we shall enter to-day. A  nephew of Taimur killed a relation of Aslam, and afterwards Taimur  sheltered him from legitimate vengeance. Just now the feud is very  active, and cattle-lifting and other reprisals are going on. \"Blood  feuds\" are of three degrees, according to the nature of the offence.  In the first a man of the one tribe can kill a man of the other  wherever he finds him. In the second he harries his cattle and goods.  In the third he simply \"boycotts\" him and refuses him a passage  through his territory. The Bakhtiaris have often been called  \"bloodthirsty.\" I doubt whether they are so, though life is of little  account, and they are reckless about spilling blood.    They have a great deal of family devotion, which in lesser degree  extends to the members of their tribe, and a Bakhtiari often spares  the life of a man who has aggrieved him owing to his fear of creating  a blood feud, which must be transmitted from father to son, and which  must affect the whole tribe. As a deterrent from acts of violence it  acts powerfully, and may account for the singular bloodlessness of  some of the tribal fights. Few men, unless carried away by a whirlwind  of fury, care to involve a tribe in the far-reaching consequences  alluded to, and bad as the custom of blood feuds is, I think there can  be no doubt that it acts as a curb upon the passions of these wild  tribesmen. \"There is blood between us and them,\" is a phrase often  heard.    Punishments are simple and deterrent, well suited to a simple people.  When a homicide is captured he is handed over to the relatives of the  slain man, who may kill him, banish him, fine him, or pardon him. In  point of fact, \"blood-money\" is paid to the family of the deceased  person, and to save his life from their vengeance a homicide  frequently becomes a mendicant on the other side of the mountains till  he can gain the required sum. Moslem charity responds freely to a  claim for alms to wipe out a blood stain. The Ilkhani has a right to  fine a homicide. \"Blood for blood\" is a maxim very early inculcated.    The present feud between the Magawe and the Zalaki tribes is of the  first degree. It is undoubtedly a part of the truly Oriental policy of  Persia to foment tribal quarrels, and keep them going, with the object  of weakening the power of the clans, which, though less so than  formerly, is a standing menace to the central government.    On reaching camp after this visit I found a greater crowd than ever,  and as \"divers of them came from far,\" I tried to help them till nine  o'clock, and as Aziz had returned the crowding was not so severe. He  said, \"You're very tired, send these people away, you've done enough.\"  I answered that one had never done enough so long as one could do  more, and he made a remark which led me to ask him if he thought a  _Kafir_ could reach Paradise? He answered \"Oh no!\" very hastily, but  after a moment's thought said, \"I don't know, God knows, _He doesn't  think as we do_, He may be more merciful than we think. If Kafirs fear  God they may have some Paradise to themselves, we don't know.\"         I. L. B.          LETTER XVIII (_Continued_)[5]           CAMP KALA KUH, _July 16_.    The call to \"Boot and Saddle\" was at three, and I was nearly too tired  to pack in the sultry morning air. The heat is overpowering. Khaja  Taimur no doubt had reasons for a difficulty in providing guides,  which caused delay. The track lay through pretty country, with  abounding herbage, to the village and _imamzada_ of Makhedi. There the  guide said he dared not go any farther for fear of being killed, and  after some time another was procured. During this delay a crowd of  handsome but hardship-aged women gathered round me, many of them  touching the handkerchiefs on their heads and then tapping the palms  of their hands, a significant sign, which throughout Persia, being  interpreted, means, \"Give me some money.\"    The Agha is in the habit of gathering the little girls about him and  giving them _krans_ as from his own children, a most popular  proceeding usually; but here the people were not friendly, and very  suspicious. Even the men asked me clamorously, \"Why does he give them  money? It's poisoned, it's cursed, it's to make them blind.\" However,  avarice prevailed over fear. The people rarely see money, and it is  not used as a medium of exchange, but they value it highly for paying  the tribute and as ornaments for the women. Barter is the custom, and  with regard to \"tradesmen,\" whether in camps or villages, it is usual  for each family to pay so much grain annually to the blacksmith, the  carpenter, the shoemaker--_i.e._ the man who makes compressed rag or  leather soles for _ghevas_ and unites the cotton webbing (\"upper\") to  the sole--and the _hammam_ keeper, in the rare cases where there is  one. They were cutting wheat on July 12 there at an altitude of 7000  feet. Where there are only camps the oxen tread it out at once on the  hard soil of the fields, but where there is a village the sheaves are  brought in on donkeys' backs to a house roof of sun-dried clay, and  are there trodden out, the roofs being usually accessible from the  slope above.    We descended to a deep ford, crossed the river Ab-i-Baznoi (locally  known as Kakulistan, or \"the curl,\" from its singular windings), there  about sixty feet wide, with clear rapid water of a sky-blue tint, very  strong, and up to the guide's waist, and entered a steep-sided stony  valley, where the heat was simply sickening. There the second guide  left us, saying he should be killed if he went any farther, but  another was willing to succeed him. After a steep ascent we emerged on  a broad rolling upland valley, deeply gashed by a stream, with the  grand range of the Kala Kuh on the south side, and low bare hills on  the north. It is now populous, the valley and hillsides are spotted  with large camps, and the question at once arose, \"Hostile or  Friendly?\"    I was riding as usual with Mirza behind me, when a man with a gun  rushed frantically towards me from an adjacent camp, waving his gun  and shouting, \"Who are you? Why are you in our country? You're friends  of Khaja Taimur, you've given him presents, we'll rob you\"! With  these and many similar words he pursued us, and men started up as by  magic, with long guns, running alongside, the low spurs became covered  with people in no time, and there was much signalling from hill to  hill, \"A-hoy-hoy-hoy-hoy,\" and sending of messengers. Mirza pacified  them by saying that we are friends of Isfandyar Khan, and that I have  presents for Aslam Khan, their chief; but soon the shout of  \"Feringhis\" was raised, and from group to group along the knolls  swelled the cry of \"Feringhis! Feringhis!\" mixed with a few shouts of  _Kafir_; but without actual molestation we reached a steep and  uncomfortable camping-ground, Padshah-i-Zalaki, at an altitude of 7800  feet, with an extensive view of the broad green valley.    Before we halted Aslam Khan, a very fine-looking man, and others met  us, and performed feats of horsemanship, wheeling their horses in  small circles at a gallop, and firing pantomimically over their left  shoulders and right flanks. The Sahib came in later, so that our party  was a tolerably strong one.    The first thing the people did was to crowd into the shelter-tent and  lie down, staring fixedly, a thing which never happened before, and  groups steadily occupied the tops of the adjacent spurs. After my tent  was pitched the people assembled round it in such numbers, ostensibly  desiring medicine, that the Khan sent two _tufangchis_ to keep order  among them, and Karim, whose arm is now well, was added as a  protection. The Agha ordered that the people should sit in rows at the  sides and take their turn, one at a time, to come into the verandah,  but no sooner were he and Aziz Khan out of sight than they began to  crowd, to shout, and to become unmanageable, scuffling and pushing,  the _tufangchis_ pretending to beat them with the barrels of their  guns, but really encouraging them, and at length going away, saying  they could not manage them. Karim begged me to stop giving medicine,  for he was overpowered, and if he opposed them any more there would be  a fight. They had said that if he \"spoke another word they would kill  him.\" They were perfectly good-humoured all the time, but acted like  complete savages, getting under the _flys_, tugging at the tent ropes,  and trying to pull my blankets off the bed, etc. At last the hindmost  gave a sudden push, sending the foremost tumbling into the tent and  over me, upsetting a large open packet of sulphate of zinc, just  arrived from Julfa, which was on my lap.    I left the tent to avoid further mischief, but was nearly suffocated  by their crowding and tugging my dress, shouting \"_Hak[=i]m!  Hak["]]]
