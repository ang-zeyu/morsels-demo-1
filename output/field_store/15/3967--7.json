MORTIMER (angrily).  No, we are losing time.    LEICESTER.               The queen depends  On you, and will the readier make a show  Of mercy; and I may prevail on her  To give an audience to her adversary;  And by this stratagem we tie her hands  Yes! I will make the attempt, strain every nerve.    MORTIMER.  And what is gained by this? When she discovers  That I am cheating her, that Mary lives;  Are we not where we were? She never will  Be free; the mildest doom which can await her  At best is but perpetual confinement.  A daring deed must one day end the matter;  Why will you not with such a deed begin?  The power is in your hands, would you but rouse  The might of your dependents round about  Your many castles, 'twere an host; and still  Has Mary many secret friends. The Howards  And Percies' noble houses, though their chiefs  Be fallen, are rich in heroes; they but wait  For the example of some potent lord.  Away with feigning--act an open part,  And, like a loyal knight, protect your fair;  Fight a good fight for her! You know you are  Lord of the person of the Queen of England,  Whene'er you will: invite her to your castle,  Oft hath she thither followed you--then show  That you're a man; then speak as master; keep her  Confined till she release the Queen of Scots.    LEICESTER.  I am astonished--I am terrified!  Where would your giddy madness hurry you?  Are you acquainted with this country? Know you  The deeps and shallows of this court? With what  A potent spell this female sceptre binds  And rules men's spirits round her? 'Tis in vain  You seek the heroic energy which once  Was active in this land! it is subdued,  A woman holds it under lock and key,  And every spring of courage is relaxed.  Follow my counsel--venture nothing rashly.  Some one approaches-go----    MORTIMER.               And Mary hopes--  Shall I return to her with empty comfort?    LEICESTER.  Bear her my vows of everlasting love.    MORTIMER.  Bear them yourself! I offered my assistance  As her deliverer, not your messenger.                      [Exit.        SCENE IX.       ELIZABETH, LEICESTER.    ELIZABETH.  Say, who was here? I heard the sound of voices.    LEICESTER (turning quickly and perplexed round on hearing the QUEEN).  It was young Mortimer----    ELIZABETH.               How now, my lord:  Why so confused?    LEICESTER (collecting himself).           Your presence is the cause.  Ne'er did I see thy beauty so resplendent,  My sight is dazzled by thy heavenly charms.  Oh!    ELIZABETH.     Whence this sigh?    LEICESTER.              Have I no reason, then,  To sigh? When I behold you in your glory,  I feel anew, with pain unspeakable,  The loss which threatens me.    ELIZABETH.                 What loss, my lord?    LEICESTER.  Your heart; your own inestimable self  Soon will you feel yourself within the arms  Of your young ardent husband, highly blessed;  He will possess your heart without a rival.  He is of royal blood, that am not I.  Yet, spite of all the world can say, there lives not  One on this globe who with such fervent zeal  Adores you as the man who loses you.  Anjou hath never seen you, can but love  Your glory and the splendor of your reign;  But I love you, and were you born of all  The peasant maids the poorest, I the first  Of kings, I would descend to your condition,  And lay my crown and sceptre at your feet!    ELIZABETH.  Oh, pity me, my Dudley; do not blame me;  I cannot ask my heart. Oh, that had chosen  Far otherwise! Ah, how I envy others  Who can exalt the object of their love!  But I am not so blest: 'tis not my fortune  To place upon the brows of him, the dearest  Of men to me, the royal crown of England.  The Queen of Scotland was allowed to make  Her hand the token of her inclination;  She hath had every freedom, and hath drunk,  Even to the very dregs, the cup of joy.    LEICESTER.  And now she drinks the bitter cup of sorrow.    ELIZABETH.  She never did respect the world's opinion;  Life was to her a sport; she never courted  The yoke to which I bowed my willing neck.  And yet, methinks, I had as just a claim  As she to please myself and taste the joys  Of life: but I preferred the rigid duties  Which royalty imposed on me; yet she,  She was the favorite of all the men  Because she only strove to be a woman;  And youth and age became alike her suitors.  Thus are the men voluptuaries all!  The willing slaves of levity and pleasure;  Value that least which claims their reverence.  And did not even Talbot, though gray-headed,  Grow young again when speaking of her charms?    LEICESTER.  Forgive him, for he was her keeper once,  And she has fooled him with her cunning wiles.    ELIZABETH.  And is it really true that she's so fair?  So often have I been obliged to hear  The praises of this wonder--it were well  If I could learn on what I might depend:  Pictures are flattering, and description lies;  I will trust nothing but my own conviction.  Why gaze you at me thus?    LEICESTER.               I placed in thought  You and Maria Stuart side by side.  Yes! I confess I oft have felt a wish,  If it could be but secretly contrived,  To see you placed beside the Scottish queen,  Then would you feel, and not till then, the full  Enjoyment of your triumph: she deserves  To be thus humbled; she deserves to see,  With her own eyes, and envy's glance is keen,  Herself surpassed, to feel herself o'ermatched,  As much by thee in form and princely grace  As in each virtue that adorns the sex.    ELIZABETH.  In years she has the advantage----    LEICESTER.                   Has she so?  I never should have thought it. But her griefs,  Her sufferings, indeed! 'tis possible  Have brought down age upon her ere her time.  Yes, and 'twould mortify her more to see thee  As bride--she hath already turned her back  On each fair hope of life, and she would see thee  Advancing towards the open arms of joy.  See thee as bride of France's royal son,  She who hath always plumed herself so high  On her connection with the house of France,  And still depends upon its mighty aid.    ELIZABETH (with a careless air).  I'm teazed to grant this interview.    LEICESTER.                     She asks it  As a favor; grant it as a punishment.  For though you should conduct her to the block,  Yet would it less torment her than to see  Herself extinguished by your beauty's splendor.  Thus can you murder her as she hath wished  To murder you. When she beholds your beauty,  Guarded by modesty, and beaming bright,  In the clear glory of unspotted fame  (Which she with thoughtless levity discarded),  Exalted by the splendor of the crown,  And blooming now with tender bridal graces--  Then is the hour of her destruction come.  Yes--when I now behold you--you were never,  No, never were you so prepared to seal  The triumph of your beauty. As but now  You entered the apartment, I was dazzled  As by a glorious vision from on high.  Could you but now, now as you are, appear  Before her, you could find no better moment.    ELIZABETH.  Now? no, not now; no, Leicester; this must be  Maturely weighed--I must with Burleigh----    LEICESTER.                        Burleigh!  To him you are but sovereign, and as such  Alone he seeks your welfare; but your rights,  Derived from womanhood, this tender point  Must be decided by your own tribunal,  Not by the statesman; yet e'en policy  Demands that you should see her, and allure  By such a generous deed the public voice.  You can hereafter act as it may please you,  To rid you of the hateful enemy.    ELIZABETH.  But would it then become me to behold  My kinswoman in infamy and want?  They say she is not royally attended;  Would not the sight of her distress reproach me?    LEICESTER.  You need not cross her threshold; hear my counsel.  A fortunate conjuncture favors it.  The hunt you mean to honor with your presence  Is in the neighborhood of Fotheringay;  Permission may be given to Lady Stuart  To take the air; you meet her in the park,  As if by accident; it must not seem  To have been planned, and should you not incline,  You need not speak to her.    ELIZABETH.                If I am foolish,  Be yours the fault, not mine. I would not care  To-day to cross your wishes; for to-day  I've grieved you more than all my other subjects.     [Tenderly.  Let it then be your fancy. Leicester, hence  You see the free obsequiousness of love.  Which suffers that which it cannot approve.       [LEICESTER prostrates himself before her, and the curtain falls.          ACT III.    SCENE I.       In a park. In the foreground trees; in the background     a distant prospect.       MARY advances, running from behind the trees.     HANNAH KENNEDY follows slowly.    KENNEDY.  You hasten on as if endowed with wings;  I cannot follow you so swiftly; wait.    MARY.  Freedom returns! Oh let me enjoy it.  Let me be childish; be thou childish with me.  Freedom invites me! Oh, let me employ it  Skimming with winged step light o'er the lea;  Have I escaped from this mansion of mourning?  Holds me no more the sad dungeon of care?  Let me, with joy and with eagerness burning,  Drink in the free, the celestial air.    KENNEDY.  Oh, my dear lady! but a very little  Is your sad gaol extended; you behold not  The wall that shuts us in; these plaited tufts  Of trees hide from your sight the hated object.    MARY.  Thanks to these friendly trees, that hide from me  My prison walls, and flatter my illusion!  Happy I now may deem myself, and free;  Why wake me from my dream's so sweet confusion?  The extended vault of heaven around me lies,  Free and unfettered range my wandering eyes  O'er space's vast, immeasurable sea!  From where yon misty mountains rise on high  I can my empire's boundaries explore;  And those light clouds which, steering southwards, fly,  Seek the mild clime of France's genial shore.

I will readily admit to you that, although this  splitting up of their being was unfavorable for individuals, it was the  only open road for the progress of the race. The point at which we see  humanity arrived among the Greeks was undoubtedly a maximum; it could  neither stop there nor rise higher. It could not stop there, for the sum  of notions acquired forced infallibly the intelligence to break with  feeling and intuition, and to lead to clearness of knowledge. Nor could  it rise any higher; for it is only in a determinate measure that  clearness can be reconciled with a certain degree of abundance and of  warmth. The Greeks had attained this measure, and to continue their  progress in culture, they, as we, were obliged to renounce the totality  of their being, and to follow different and separate roads in order to  seek after truth.    There was no other way to develop the manifold aptitudes of man than to  bring them in opposition with one another. This antagonism of forces is  the great instrument of culture, but it is only an instrument: for as  long as this antagonism lasts man is only on the road to culture. It is  only because these special forces are isolated in man, and because they  take on themselves to impose all exclusive legislation, that they enter  into strife with the truth of things, and oblige common sense, which  generally adheres imperturbably to external phenomena, to dive into the  essence of things. While pure understanding usurps authority in the  world of sense, and empiricism attempts to subject this intellect to the  conditions of experience, these two rival directions arrive at the  highest possible development, and exhaust the whole extent of their  sphere. While, on the one hand, imagination, by its tyranny, ventures to  destroy the order of the world, it forces reason, on the other side, to  rise up to the supreme sources of knowledge, and to invoke against this  predominance of fancy the help of the law of necessity.    By an exclusive spirit in the case of his faculties, the individual is  fatally led to error; but the species is led to truth. It is only by  gathering up all the energy of our mind in a single focus, and  concentrating a single force in our being, that we give in some sort  wings to this isolated force, and that we draw it on artificially far  beyond the limits that nature seems to have imposed upon it. If it be  certain that all human individuals taken together would never have  arrived, with the visual power given them by nature, to see a satellite  of Jupiter, discovered by the telescope of the astronomer, it is just as  well established that never would the human understanding have produced  the analysis of the infinite, or the critique of pure reason, if in  particular branches, destined for this mission, reason had not applied  itself to special researches, and it, after having, as it were, freed  itself from all matter, it had not, by the most powerful abstraction  given to the spiritual eye of man the force necessary, in order to look  into the absolute. But the question is, if a spirit thus absorbed in  pure reason and intuition will be able to emancipate itself from the  rigorous fetters of logic, to take the free action of poetry, and seize  the individuality of things with a faithful and chaste sense? Here  nature imposes even on the most universal genius a limit it cannot pass,  and truth will make martyrs as long as philosophy will be reduced to make  its principal occupation the search for arms against errors.    But whatever may be the final profit for the totality of the world, of  this distinct and special perfecting of the human faculties, it cannot be  denied that this final aim of the universe, which devotes them to this  kind of culture, is a cause of suffering, and a kind of malediction for  individuals. I admit that the exercises of the gymnasium form athletic  bodies; but beauty is only developed by the free and equal play of the  limbs. In the same way the tension of the isolated spiritual forces may  make extraordinary men; but it is only the well-tempered equilibrium of  these forces that can produce happy and accomplished men. And in what  relation should we be placed with past and future ages if the perfecting  of human nature made such a sacrifice indispensable? In that case we  should have been the slaves of humanity, we should have consumed our  forces in servile work for it during some thousands of years, and we  should have stamped on our humiliated, mutilated nature the shameful  brand of this slavery--all this in order that future generations, in a  happy leisure, might consecrate themselves to the cure of their moral  health, and develop the whole of human nature by their free culture.    But can it be true that man has to neglect himself for any end whatever?  Can nature snatch from us, for any end whatever, the perfection which is  prescribed to us by the aim of reason? It must be false that the  perfecting of particular faculties renders the sacrifice of their  totality necessary; and even if the law of nature had imperiously this  tendency, we must have the power to reform by a superior art this  totality of our being, which art has destroyed.          LETTER VII.      Can this effect of harmony be attained by the state? That is not  possible, for the state, as at present constituted, has given occasion to  evil, and the state as conceived in the idea, instead of being able to  establish this more perfect humanity, ought to be based upon it. Thus  the researches in which I have indulged would have brought me back to the  same point from which they had called me off for a time. The present  age, far from offering us this form of humanity, which we have  acknowledged as a necessary condition of an improvement of the state,  shows us rather the diametrically opposite form. If, therefore, the  principles I have laid down are correct, and if experience confirms the  picture I have traced of the present time, it would be necessary to  qualify as unseasonable every attempt to effect a similar change in the  state, and all hope as chimerical that would be based on such an attempt,  until the division of the inner man ceases, and nature has been  sufficiently developed to become herself the instrument of this great  change and secure the reality of the political creation of reason.    In the physical creation, nature shows us the road that we have to follow  in the moral creation. Only when the struggle of elementary forces has  ceased in inferior organizations, nature rises to the noble form of the  physical man. In like manner, the conflict of the elements of the moral  man and that of blind instincts must have ceased, and a coarse antagonism  in himself, before the attempt can be hazarded. On the other hand, the  independence of man's character must be secured, and his submission to  despotic forms must have given place to a suitable liberty, before the  variety in his constitution can be made subordinate to the unity of the  ideal. When the man of nature still makes such an anarchial abuse of his  will, his liberty ought hardly to be disclosed to him. And when the man  fashioned by culture makes so little use of his freedom, his free will  ought not to be taken from him. The concession of liberal principles  becomes a treason to social order when it is associated with a force  still in fermentation, and increases the already exuberant energy of its  nature. Again, the law of conformity under one level becomes tyranny to  the individual when it is allied to a weakness already holding sway and  to natural obstacles, and when it comes to extinguish the last spark of  spontaneity and of originality.    The tone of the age must therefore rise from its profound moral  degradation; on the one hand it must emancipate itself from the blind  service of nature, and on the other it must revert to its simplicity, its  truth, and its fruitful sap; a sufficient task for more than a century.  However, I admit readily, more than one special effort may meet with  success, but no improvement of the whole will result from it, and  contradictions in action will be a continual protest against the unity of  maxims. It will be quite possible, then, that in remote corners of the  world humanity may be honored in the person of the negro, while in Europe  it may be degraded in the person of the thinker. The old principles will  remain, but they will adopt the dress of the age, and philosophy will  lend its name to an oppression that was formerly authorized by the  church. In one place, alarmed at the liberty which in its opening  efforts always shows itself an enemy, it will cast itself into the arms  of a convenient servitude. In another place, reduced to despair by a  pedantic tutelage, it will be driven into the savage license of the state  of nature. Usurpation will invoke the weakness of human nature, and  insurrection will invoke its dignity, till at length the great sovereign  of all human things, blind force, shall come in and decide, like a vulgar  pugilist, this pretended contest of principles.          LETTER VIII.      Must philosophy therefore retire from this field, disappointed in its  hopes? Whilst in all other directions the dominion of forms is extended,  must this the most precious of all gifts be abandoned to a formless  chance? Must the contest of blind forces last eternally in the political  world, and is social law never to triumph over a hating egotism?    Not in the least. It is true that reason herself will never attempt  directly a struggle with this brutal force which resists her arms, and  she will be as far as the son of Saturn in the \"Iliad\" from descending  into the dismal field of battle, to fight them in person. But she  chooses the most deserving among the combatants, clothes him with divine  "]]]
