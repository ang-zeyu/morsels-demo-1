Yet nothing is more certain than that improvement in  human affairs is wholly the work of the uncontented characters; and,  moreover, that it is much easier for an active mind to acquire the  virtues of patience, than for a passive one to assume those of energy.    Of the three varieties of mental excellence, intellectual, practical,  and moral, there never could be any doubt in regard to the first two,  which side had the advantage. All intellectual superiority is the  fruit of active effort. Enterprise, the desire to keep moving, to be  trying and accomplishing new things for our own benefit or that of  others, is the parent even of speculative, and much more of practical,  talent. The intellectual culture compatible with the other type is of  that feeble and vague description which belongs to a mind that stops  at amusement or at simple contemplation. The test of real and vigorous  thinking, the thinking which ascertains truths instead of dreaming  dreams, is successful application to practice. Where that purpose does  not exist, to give definiteness, precision, and an intelligible  meaning to thought, it generates nothing better than the mystical  metaphysics of the Pythagoreans or the Veds. With respect to practical  improvement, the case is still more evident. The character which  improves human life is that which struggles with natural powers and  tendencies, not that which gives way to them. The self-benefiting  qualities are all on the side of the active and energetic character,  and the habits and conduct which promote the advantage of each  individual member of the community must be at least a part of those  which conduce most in the end to the advancement of the community as a  whole.    But on the point of moral preferability, there seems at first sight to  be room for doubt. I am not referring to the religious feeling which  has so generally existed in favor of the inactive character, as being  more in harmony with the submission due to the divine will.  Christianity, as well as other religions, has fostered this sentiment;  but it is the prerogative of Christianity, as regards this and many  other perversions, that it is able to throw them off. Abstractedly  from religious considerations, a passive character, which yields to  obstacles instead of striving to overcome them, may not indeed be very  useful to others, no more than to itself, but it might be expected to  be at least inoffensive. Contentment is always counted among the moral  virtues. But it is a complete error to suppose that contentment is  necessarily or naturally attendant on passivity of character; and  useless it is, the moral consequences are mischievous. Where there  exists a desire for advantages not possessed, the mind which does not  potentially possess them by means of its own energies is apt to look  with hatred and malice on those who do. The person bestirring himself  with hopeful prospects to improve his circumstances is the one who  feels good-will towards others engaged in, or who have succeeded in  the same pursuit. And where the majority are so engaged, those who do  not attain the object have had the tone given to their feelings by the  general habit of the country, and ascribe their failure to want of  effort or opportunity, or to their personal ill luck. But those who,  while desiring what others possess, put no energy into striving for  it, are either incessantly grumbling that fortune does not do for them  what they do not attempt to do for themselves, or overflowing with  envy and ill-will towards those who possess what they would like to  have.    In proportion as success in life is seen or believed to be the fruit  of fatality or accident and not of exertion in that same ratio does  envy develop itself as a point of national character. The most envious  of all mankind are the Orientals. In Oriental moralists, in Oriental  tales, the envious man is remarkably prominent. In real life, he is  the terror of all who possess any thing desirable, be it a palace, a  handsome child, or even good health and spirits: the supposed effect  of his mere look constitutes the all-pervading superstition of the  evil eye. Next to Orientals in envy, as in activity, are some of the  Southern Europeans. The Spaniards pursued all their great men with it,  embittered their lives, and generally succeeded in putting an early  stop to their successes. [1] With the French, who are essentially  a Southern people, the double education of despotism and Catholicism  has, in spite of their impulsive temperament, made submission and  endurance the common character of the people, and their most received  notion of wisdom and excellence; and if envy of one another, and of  all superiority, is not more rife among them than it is, the  circumstance must be ascribed to the many valuable counteracting  elements in the French character, and most of all to the great  individual energy which, though less persistent and more intermittent  than in the self-helping and struggling Anglo-Saxons, has nevertheless  manifested itself among the French in nearly every direction in which  the operation of their institutions has been favorable to it.    There are, no doubt, in all countries, really contented characters,  who not merely do not seek, but do not desire, what they do not  already possess, and these naturally bear no ill-will towards such as  have apparently a more favored lot. But the great mass of seeming  contentment is real discontent, combined with indolence or  self-indulgence, which, while taking no legitimate means of raising  itself, delights in bringing others down to its own level. And if we  look narrowly even at the cases of innocent contentment, we perceive  that they only win our admiration when the indifference is solely to  improvement in outward circumstances, and there is a striving for  perpetual advancement in spiritual worth, or at least a disinterested  zeal to benefit others. The contented man, or the contented family,  who have no ambition to make any one else happier, to promote the good  of their country or their neighborhood, or to improve themselves in  moral excellence, excite in us neither admiration nor approval. We  rightly ascribe this sort of contentment to mere unmanliness and want  of spirit. The content which we approve is an ability to do cheerfully  without what can not be had, a just appreciation of the comparative  value of different objects of desire, and a willing renunciation of  the less when incompatible with the greater. These, however, are  excellences more natural to the character, in proportion as it is  actively engaged in the attempt to improve its own or some other lot.  He who is continually measuring his energy against difficulties,  learns what are the difficulties insuperable to him, and what are  those which, though he might overcome, the success is not worth the  cost. He whose thoughts and activities are all needed for, and  habitually employed in, practicable and useful enterprises, is the  person of all others least likely to let his mind dwell with brooding  discontent upon things either not worth attaining, or which are not so  to him. Thus the active, self-helping character is not only  intrinsically the best, but is the likeliest to acquire all that is  really excellent or desirable in the opposite type.    The striving, go-ahead character of England and the United States is  only a fit subject of disapproving criticism on account of the very  secondary objects on which it commonly expends its strength. In itself  it is the foundation of the best hopes for the general improvement of  mankind. It has been acutely remarked that whenever any thing goes  amiss, the habitual impulse of French people is to say, \"Il faut de la  patience;\" and of English people, \"What a shame!\" The people who think  it a shame when any thing goes wrong--who rush to the conclusion that  the evil could and ought to have been prevented, are those who, in the  long run, do most to make the world better. If the desires are low  placed, if they extend to little beyond physical comfort, and the show  of riches, the immediate results of the energy will not be much more  than the continual extension of man's power over material objects; but  even this makes room, and prepares the mechanical appliances for the  greatest intellectual and social achievements; and while the energy is  there, some persons will apply it, and it will be applied more and  more, to the perfecting, not of outward circumstances alone, but of  man's inward nature. Inactivity, unaspiringness, absence of desire,  are a more fatal hindrance to improvement than any misdirection of  energy, and is that through which alone, when existing in the mass,  any very formidable misdirection by an energetic few becomes possible.  It is this, mainly, which retains in a savage or semi-savage state the  great majority of the human race.    Now there can be no kind of doubt that the passive type of character  is favored by the government of one or a few, and the active  self-helping type by that of the many. Irresponsible rulers need the  quiescence of the ruled more than they need any activity but that  which they can compel. Submissiveness to the prescriptions of men as  necessities of nature is the lesson inculcated by all governments upon  those who are wholly without participation in them. The will of  superiors, and the law as the will of superiors, must be passively  yielded to. But no men are mere instruments or materials in the hands  of their rulers who have will, or spirit, or a spring of internal  activity in the rest of their proceedings, and any manifestation of  these qualities, instead of receiving encouragement from despots, has  to get itself forgiven by them. Even when irresponsible rulers are not  sufficiently conscious of danger from the mental activity of their  subjects to be desirous of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#11)"],[1,"all wounds of  great joints, and especially contused wounds, were mortal,  according to all those who have written about them. He asked the  others what they thought of it, and chiefly Master Gilbert, who  told him he had great hope his Lord the King would recover; which  made the Prince very glad.    Four days later, the King, and the Queen-mother, and M. le  Cardinal de Bourbon, his brother, and M. le Prince de la Roche-  sur-Yon, and M. de Guise, and other great persons, after we had  dressed the King of Navarre, wished us to hold a consultation in  their presence, all the physicians and surgeons together. Each of  them said what he thought, and there was not one but had good  hope, they said, that he would recover. I persisted always in the  contrary. M. le Prince, who loved me, drew me aside, and said I  was alone against the opinion of all the others, and prayed me  not to be obstinate against so many good men. I answered, When I  shall see good signs of recovery, I will change my mind. Many  consultations were held, and I never changed what I said, and the  prognosis I had made at the first dressing, and said always the  arm would fall into a gangrene: which it did, for all the care  they could give to it; and he rendered his spirit to God the  eighteenth day after his wound.    M. le Prince, having heard of it, sent to me his surgeon, and his  physician, one Lefevre, now physician-in-ordinary to the King and  Queen-mother, to say he wished to have the bullet, and we were to  look for it, to see where it was. Then I was very glad, and  assured them I should quickly find it; which I did in their  presence, with many other gentlemen: it was just in the very  middle of the bone. M. le Prince took and showed it to the King  and to the Queen, who all said that my prognosis had come true.  The body was laid to rest at Chateau Gaillard: and I returned to  Paris, where I found many patients, who had been wounded on the  breach at Rouen, and chiefly Italians, who were very eager I  should dress them: which I did willingly. Many of them recovered:  the rest died. Mon petit maistre, I think you were called to  dress some, for the great number there was of them.          THE BATTLE OF DREUX. 1562      The day after the battle of Dreux, the King bade me go and dress  M. le Comte d'Eu, who had been wounded in the right thigh, near  the hip-joint, with a pistol-shot: which had smashed and broken  the thigh-bone into many pieces: whereon many accidents  supervened, and at last death, to my great grief. The day after I  came, I would go to the camp where the battle had been, to see  the dead bodies. I saw, for a long league round, the earth all  covered: they estimated it at twenty-five thousand men or more;  and it was all done in less than two hours. I wish, mon petit  maistre, for the love I bear you, you had been there, to tell it  to your scholars and your children.    Now while I was at Dreux, I visited and dressed a great number of  gentlemen, and poor soldiers, and among the rest many of the  Swiss captains. I dressed fourteen all in one room, all wounded  with pistol-shots and other diabolical firearms, and not one of  the fourteen died. M. le Comte d'Eu being dead, I made no long  stay at Dreux. Surgeons came from Paris, who fulfilled their duty  to the wounded, as Pigray, Cointeret, Hubert, and others; and I  returned to Paris, where I found many wounded gentlemen who had  retreated thither after the battle, to have their wounds dressed;  and I was not there without seeing many of them.          THE JOURNEY TO HAVRE DE GRACE. 1563      And I will not omit to tell of the camp at Havre de Grace. When  our artillery came before the walls of the town, the English  within the walls killed some of our men, and several pioneers who  were making gabions. And seeing they were so wounded that there  was no hope of curing them, their comrades stripped them, and put  them still living inside the gabions, which served to fill them  up. When the English saw that they could not withstand our  attack, because they were hard hit by sickness, and especially by  the plague, they surrendered. The King gave them ships to return  to England, very glad to be out of this plague-stricken place.  The greater part of them died, and they took the plague to  England, and they have not got rid of it since. Captain  Sarlabous, master of the camp, was left in garrison, with six  ensigns of infantry, who had no fear of the plague; and they were  very glad to get into the town, hoping to enjoy themselves there,  Mon petit maistre, if you had been there, you would have done as  they did.          THE JOURNEY TO BAYONNE. 1564      I went with the King on that journey to Bayonne, when we were two  years and more making the tour of well-nigh all this kingdom. And  in many towns and villages I was called in consultation over  sundry diseases, with the late M. Chapelain, chief physician to  the King, and M. Castellan, chief physician to the Queen-mother;  honorable men and very learned in medicine and surgery. During  this journey, I always inquired of the surgeons if they had noted  anything rare in their practices, so that I might learn something  new. While I was at Bayonne, two things happened worthy of remark  by young surgeons. The first is, I dressed a Spanish gentleman,  who had a great and enormous swelling of the throat. He had  lately been touched by the deceased King Charles for the king's  evil. I opened his swelling. ... I left him in the hands of a  surgeon of the town, to finish his cure. M. de Fontaine, Knight  of the Order of the King, had a severe continued pestilent fever,  accompanied with many inflammatory swellings in sundry parts of  the body. He had bleeding at the nose for two days, without  ceasing, nor could we staunch it: and after this haemorrhage the  fever ceased, with much sweating, and by and bye the swellings  suppurated, and he was dressed by me, and healed by the grace of  God.          BATTLE OF SAINT DENIS, 1567      As for the battle of Saint Denis, there were many killed on both  sides. Our wounded withdrew to Paris to be dressed, with the  prisoners they had taken, and I dressed many of them. The King  ordered me, at the request of Mme. the Constable's Lady, to go to  her house to dress the Constable; who had a pistol-shot in the  middle of the spine of his back, whereby at once he lost all  feeling and movement in his thighs and legs ... because the  spinal cord, whence arise the nerves to give feeling and movement  to the parts below, was crushed, broken, and torn by the force of  the bullet. Also he lost understanding and reason, and in a few  days he died. The surgeons of Paris were hard put to it for many  days to treat all the wounded. I think, mon petit maistre, you  saw some of them. I beseech the great God of victories, that we  be never more employed in such misfortune and disaster.          VOYAGE OF THE BATTLE OF MONCONTOUR. 1569      During the battle of Moncontour, King Charles was at Plessis-les-  Tours, where he heard the news of the victory. A great number of  gentlemen and soldiers retreated into the town and suburbs of  Tours, wounded, to be dressed and treated; and the King and the  Queen-mother bade me do my duty by them, with other surgeons who  were then on duty, as Pigray, du Bois, Portail, and one Siret, a  surgeon of Tours, a man well versed in surgery, who was at this  time surgeon to the King's brother. And for the multitude of bad  cases we had scarce any rest, nor the physicians either.    M. le Comte de Mansfeld, Governor of the Duchy of Luxembourg,  Knight of the Order of the King, was severely wounded in the  battle, in the left arm, with a pistol-shot which broke a great  part of his elbow; and he withdrew to Borgueil near Tours. Then  he sent a gentleman to the King, to beg him to send one of his  surgeons, to help him of his wound. So they debated which surgeon  they should send. M. le Marechal de Montmorency told the King and  the Queen that they ought to send him their chief surgeon; and  urged that M. de Mansfeld had done much toward the victory.    The King said flat, he would not have me go, and wished me to  stop with himself. Then the Queen-mother told him I would but go  and come back, and he must remember it was a foreign lord, who  had come, at the command of the King of Spain, to help him. then  he let me go, provided I came back very soon. So he sent for me,  and the Queen-mother with him, and bade me go and find the Lord  de Mansfeld, wherever he should be, to do all I could for him to  heal his wound. I went to him, with a letter from Their  Majesties. When he saw it, he received me with good-will, and  forthwith dismissed three or four surgeons who were dressing him;  which was to my very great regret, because his wound seemed to me  incurable.    Now many gentlemen had retreated to Borgueil, having been  wounded: for they knew that M. de Guise was there, who also had  been badly wounded with a pistol-shot through the leg, and they  were sure that he would have good surgeons to dress him, and  would help them, as he is kindly and very generous, and would  relieve their wants. This he did with a will, both for their  eating and drinking, and for what else they needed: and for my  part, they had the comfort and help of my art: some died, others  recovered, according to their wounds. M. le Comte Ringrave died,  who was shot in the shoulder, like the King of Navarre before  Rouen. M. de Bassompierre, colonel of twelve hundred horse, was  wounded by a similar shot, in the same place, as M. de Mansfeld:  whom I dressed, and God healed. God blessed my work so well, that  in three weeks I sent them back to Paris: where I had still to  make incisions in M. de Mansfeld's arm, to remove some pieces of  the bones, which were badly splintered, broken, and carious. He  was healed by the grace of God, and made me a handsome present,  so I was well content with him,"]]]
