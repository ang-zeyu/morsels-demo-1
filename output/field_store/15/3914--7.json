Besides, there was danger we might fall on the  steps and get hurt.    I didn't know at the time why they didn't want us to go upstairs.  They didn't tell us the truth about it.  What they told us was,  \"If you go up there, the Old Bootjack will get you.\"  Well, I was  almost grown before I learned what a bootjack was.  Then it was  easy to see that a bootjack wouldn't hurt anyone, especially  little kids.  But the fear of it served its purpose.  And I  suppose we were not mentally warped because of having been fibbed  to.    We learned other lessons also--some the expensive way.  I  remember, some of us Johnson kids were at Uncle John Hudson's  house one day, playing with all his kids, when we discovered a  pig out of his pen.    Now, Uncle John was away from home at that time and we thought we  should do him a big favor and get his pig back in the pen with  its mama.  I don't know why, he couldn't hurt anything, he was  too small.  But he had a pen and we kids thought a pig ought to  be in his pen.  So we got after him.    It was a hot day.  In fact, it was so hot that the sandy ground  burned our bare feet.  We were suffering from the heat but we  thought we must not stop until we caught him.  We felt duty bound  to get that pig back in his pen.    We chased him all over the place and finally caught him out in  the peach orchard.  Well, we were hot, the ground was hot, the  weather was hot, but most of all, that little pig was hot.    We carried our little prisoner and we all got under the shade of  a peach tree.  We kids cooled off right away, but the pig was so  tired and was breathing so fast, we thought we ought to cool him  off with some cool water.    We carried water from the windmill--good, cool water right out of  the well.  Then we poured it on the little pig--and he was dead  in about one minute flat.    We were sorry, but how were we to know that cold water would kill  a hot pig?  No one had ever told us it would.  We learned that  lesson the hard way--that is, hard on Uncle John.  And we learned  some other things too, when he learned about his pig.  Oh yes, he  told us a few things he wanted us to know.    Regardless of all the little mistakes we kids made, we generally  had the run of the farm at our Exum place, except for a few  things which were not allowed.  One of these was, \"Don't climb on  the feed stacks.\"  That would destroy a lot of the feed and allow  rainwater to run in and ruin even more of it.  No problem there.  Most any kid could follow that line of reasoning.  But another  \"Don't\" that was not so easily understood was, \"Don't play in the  cottonseed.\"    What could it hurt to play in it?  It was in a nice bin, and we  would leave it in the bin.  Walking on it wouldn't hurt it.  Digging holes and tunnels in it wouldn't damage the seed.  This  was forbidden fruit we just couldn't understand.    So, the rule about not playing in the cottonseed had its effect  on cultivating our dishonesty.  It was so much fun, we went ahead  and played in the cottonseed bin anyway, when we thought the  coast was clear.  And I can't remember ever having gotten caught  at it.    I can understand it all now.  If we had been allowed to play in  the cottonseed, we might have gotten careless about wasting seed  out the door when we were having a cottonseed fight.  And, more  than likely, we would have left the door open at times for the  rain and rats and cows to get in.  And of course, a cave-in in  one of our tunnels might have trapped one of the smaller kids  when there were no large ones around for rescue work.  We hadn't  thought of that.    But we couldn't understand it at that time, and it seemed to us  that this cottonseed \"don't\" was not an absolute \"don't,\" but  perhaps more of an \"I don't think you ought to\" kind of a  \"don't.\"  So, when viewed from that angle, we didn't feel so  guilty.  We just played in the seed and enjoyed it.    But since there was at least a half-hearted rule against playing  in the cottonseed, we didn't dare leave the door open when we  were playing inside.  Papa could have spotted that open door a  quarter-mile away and, come supper time, we kids would have had  to answer a question or two.  Also, a few seeds outside on the  ground could have been seen by conservative parents or maybe by a  brother who was bent on \"getting even\" with another brother, and  at the same time, putting a fresh shine on his little halo by  tattling.    In spite of all the drawbacks, we played in the cottonseed, and  naturally we stirred up dust.  And when the sun shone through the  cracks onto that dust, it was hard to see through it--it was sort  of like a wall that you could walk right through.    One day we were playing in the seed when the sun was shining  through a horizontal crack in the boards.  The dust in the  sunshine looked a lot like a large board, lying flat above the  seed.  I tried to crawl up on the dust as though it were a table  top.  But of course, it wouldn't hold me up.    I couldn't understand it.  So I stirred up more dust until it  became very dense.  Then I tried jumping up on it.  But it still  wouldn't hold me up.    Years later, I learned why.  The dust wasn't as dense as I was.    I have told you about a three or four-year-old boy planting with  a two-row planter, a dog plowing for his master, and Texas kids  trying to walk on dust clouds.  Don't go away, I have other true  stories to tell you.    As I mentioned before, I have heard Papa tell of trail driving  near San Angelo, Texas.  He was just a lad at that time--couldn't  have been more than 17 or 18 years old.  Here is what he told me  about 35 years later:    One time when they were on the trail, they had bedded their  cattle down one night near San Angelo and were sitting around the  camp fire doing nothing when one cowboy said, \"Let's go into town  and get something to drink.\"    Another one said, \"Good idea, but we're all broke and the boss is  two days behind.  How you gonna get whiskey without money?\"    He said, \"Saddle up and go with me and I'll show you.\"    Now this would be worth seeing, so quite a few of the boys rode  with him into town--carrying jugs half full of water.    History tells us that along about that time, San Angelo was made  up of at least 20 saloons and fewer than that number of all other  stores combined.    Before the cowboys reached town, they all knew just what to do.  After hiding their billfolds in their saddle bags, they each took  a jug and split up, one going to this saloon and one to that  saloon and so on.    Then each in turn told the bartender that they were out on the  trail with only half a jug of whiskey, and would he finish  filling it up?  After the jug was filled, the cowboy would reach  for his wallet only to \"discover\" that he had lost it.  The  bartender would just have to take back his half-gallon.  The poor  boy would have to \"make out\" with only his original half-gallon.    Now, with quite a few cowpokes pulling this little stunt in about  half the saloons in San Angelo, you can bet your boots they rode  back to camp with plenty of what they came for, a little weak,  but free.    When Papa was a boy, the lives of his entire family had to do  with saddle horses and cattle.  Even the little girls liked to  ride horses and play cowboy.  The youngest girl, Annie, was one  of those little girls.  But when Annie became big enough to do  chores, one of her chores was to churn the milk that made the  butter for the family.  And she hated to have to stay home and  churn while her brothers rode out into the pasture after the  cows.    Now, I'm not positive of this, but knowing Papa as I do, I  wouldn't be surprised if he had something to do with helping his  little sister solve her problem.  Whoever it was, the idea worked  well and made a little girl happy.  She would tie a jar of milk  to her saddle and ride on out with the boys, letting her horse do  the churning.    At the Exum farm Mr. Whatley's pasture joined our field.  And in  his pasture he had an old cow which was well educated in the art  of breaking through fences.  And she seemed to enjoy slipping  into our corn patch.    Now, the normal procedure for the average farmer was to put a  yoke on the neck of such an animal.  Of course, the purpose of  the yoke was to bridge across the wires and stop the cow from  going through the fence.    But this old cow soon learned to use the yoke to break the wires  so she could get through the fence easier.  And she had been  spending entirely too much of her time in our field.  Mr. Whatley  either could not or would not keep her out.  Papa thought he  ought to keep her out.    I never learned where Papa got the idea of shooting the cow--  whether it was his own idea or whether a neighbor had prescribed  the remedy.  And even though Papa was smart in most cases, I  really think he used poor judgment when he shot the cow.  He only  meant for the shots to sting her enough to make our corn patch  unpleasant for her.  But he either misjudged his distance from  the cow or he misread the size of shot in the shell he used.    When he shot the cow, she just stood there, I guess wondering  what hit her.  Papa doubted that he had hit her at all.  So he  moved up closer and fired a second shot, which really hurt the  old cow much more than Papa had meant to hurt her.    When Mr. Whatley took a look at his cow, he was hurt even more.  He told the County Judge about it and the judge told Papa to pay  Mr. Whatley for his wounded cow.    Papa argued that the cow had damaged his corn more than he had  damaged the cow--in fact, more than the cow was worth.  The judge  agreed, that might well be true, but it didn't give Papa the  right to go around shooting his neighbor's cow.  Besides, in this  case, the corn would get well much sooner than the cow would.    Papa paid Mr. Whatley for his cow, and went home a little"]]]
