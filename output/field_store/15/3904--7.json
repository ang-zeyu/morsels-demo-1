D. 1830, or the first part of the year 1831. I remember the time      when Sidney Rigdon came to my father's place, and that it was after      the removal of my father from Waterloo, N.Y., to Kirtland, O. That      this was in the year 1831.\" [116]    [Footnote 116: \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 34. Braden-Kelly Debate,  100.]    In 1827 and 1828, when Rigdon's visits must have occurred, and his help  was needed in revamping Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found,\" this woman was  fourteen or fifteen years of age. That Rigdon did visit at the Smiths'  in New York State, December, 1830, is admitted, [117] and of this she  seemingly remembers nothing. She has no recollection of Rigdon's coming  to her father's or brother's house until after their removal to Ohio.  May she not also, either by design or otherwise, have forgotten visits  made by Rigdon to her New York home prior to the admitted, and, by her,  forgotten one in December, 1830?    [Footnote 117: Supplement 14 _Millennial Star,_ 49.]    In the same statement she avers that \"at the time of the publication  of said Book [of Mormon], my brother Joseph Smith, Jr., lived in the  family of my father in the town of Manchester, Ontario County, N.Y.,  and that he had all of his life to this time made his home with the  family.\"    The manuscript of the Book of Mormon was finished and the book  copyrighted by June 11, 1829._Millennial Star,_ 24. 118 Rigdon's help  would be most needed before this time, and from June, 1828, until June,  1829, all and numerous revelations are dated \"Harmony, Pennsylvania,\"  which, together with Smith's autobiography, shows that he did not all  of his lifetime make his home with his parents, nor live at Manchester  during all of the most important period of Mormon incubation. The  probabilities are that Smith moved to Pennsylvania at this time, for  the very purpose of making it easier for Rigdon and Pratt, who lived in  Ohio, to furnish him the much needed help.    The admitted errors in Mrs. Salisbury's statement destroy its  evidentiary value, and leave it clearly demonstrated by the other  evidence adduced, that Rigdon visited Smith' several years before the  appearance of the Book of Mormon.    THE CONVERSION OF PARLEY P. PRATT.    In the summer of 1830 the Book of Mormon came from the press, and the  time had come for Pratt and Rigdon to be astonished by its appearance.  Now watch their maneuvers. That year Pratt left Ohio for a visit to New  York. Of this trip his autobiography records the following:        \"Landing in Buffalo, we [Pratt and wife] engaged our passage for      Albany in a canal boat, distance three hundred and sixty miles.      This, including board, cost all our money and some articles of      clothing.\"    Would a mere desire to visit friends induce him to give up part of his  clothing for passage money? Hardly; he was after larger game. But let  us read on:        \"Arriving at Rochester, I informed my wife that, notwithstanding      our passage being paid through the whole distance, yet I must leave      the boat and leave her to pursue her passage to our friends, while      I would stop a while in this region. _Why, I did not know;_ but so      it was plainly manifest by the Spirit to me. I said to her: 'We      part for a season; go and visit our friends in our native place;      I will come soon, but how soon I know not, _for I have a work to      do in this region of country, and what it is or how long it will      take me to perform it, I know not;_ but I will come when it is      performed. My wife would have objected to this, but she had seen      the _Hand of God_ so plainly manifest in His dealings with me many      times that she dare not oppose the things manifest to me by His      Spirit. She therefore consented, and I accompanied her as far as      Newark, a small town upwards of a hundred miles from Buffalo, and      then took leave of her and of the boat.\"        \"It was early in the morning, just at the dawn of day. I walked ten      miles into the country [remember now he doesn't know where he is      going], and stopped with a Mr. Wells.\"    This was undoubtedly a member of the same Wells family of Macedon with  whom Joseph Smith had long been on terms of intimacy.[119] Pratt's  autobiography continues:    [Footnote 119: \"Joseph Smith, the Prophet,\" by Lucy Smith, 101-103.  Probably this refers to the home of Daniel H. Wells, afterward a  prominent Mormon in Utah.]        \"I proposed to preach in the evening. Mr. Wells readily accompanied      me through the neighborhood to visit the people and circulate the      appointment.\"        \"We visited an old Baptist deacon by the name of Hamblin. After      hearing of our appointment for the evening, he began to tell of      _a book, a strange book, a very strange book_ in his possession,      which had just been published. I inquired of him how and where the      book was to be obtained. He promised me the perusal of it at his      house the next day, if I would call. I felt a strange interest in      the book. Next morning I called at his house, where, for the first      time, my eyes beheld the 'Book of Mormon,' that book of books.\"    Pratt says he opened it with eagerness and examined its contents.  \"As I read, _the spirit of the Lord was upon me,_ and I knew and  comprehended that the book was true as plainly and as manifestly as a  man comprehends and knows that he exists.\" [120]    [Footnote 120: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 37-38.]    Pratt soon determined to see Smith, and, accordingly, visited Palmyra,  where Hyrum Smith welcomed him to their house, and they spent the  night together. Joseph had not returned from Pennsylvania. One is led  to wonder if Hyrum Smith would take in every inquisitive stranger as  his bedfellow. In the morning Pratt returned to fill his appointment  to preach the doctrine of Alexander Campbell. Hyrum Smith presented  Pratt with a copy of the book, which the latter tells us he was glad to  receive, because he had not yet finished his reading of it. [121] Pratt  preached the doctrines of the \"Disciples\" that night and the following  one, then returned to the Smith house, and from there went to the  Whitmers in Seneca County, resting that night, and taking his Mormon  baptism the next day. On the next Sabbath Pratt attended a Mormon  meeting and preached a Mormon sermon at the house of one Burroughs. \"My  work was now completed, for which I took leave of my wife and the canal  boat some two or three weeks before.\" [122]    [Footnote 121: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 39-42.]    [Footnote 122: \"Autobiography of P.P. Pratt,\" 43.]    About the details and the order of events in such remarkable  occurrences, there could not possibly be doubt or errors of memory.  Had they actually transpired, these events would have been the most  important in any eventful career, and would have been indelibly  impressed upon Pratt's memory. If, however, this marvelous tale is  but a falsehood told to conceal Pratt's real connection with a fraud,  then, it is quite possible that he and those associated with him should  forget how the falsehood had been told at other times, and thus produce  contradictory statements.    Let us, in the light of this comment, examine the foregoing account  more carefully. Evidently, in this account Pratt is desirous of  conveying the impression that, as he had elsewhere expressed it, he  \"was greatly prejudiced against the book.\" [123] However, in a sermon  delivered in 1856--thirty-two years before the publication of the  autobiography--Pratt tells us he was converted before completing the  reading of the Book of Mormon, or meeting a single true \"Saint.\" Here  are his own words:    [Footnote 123: Pratt's reply to Sunderland, copied in 45 _Saints'  Herald,_ 61. \"Myth of the Manuscript Found,\" 32.]        \"I knew it was true, because it was light, and had come in      fulfillment of scripture; and _I bore testimony of its truth_      to the neighbors that came in _during the first day that I      sat reading_ it at the house of an old Baptist deacon named      Hamblin.\" [124]    [Footnote 124: 5 _Journal of Discourses,_ 194. This Hamblin seems to  have emigrated to Wisconsin with Pratt, there became a Mormon and later  his son became implicated in the Mountain Meadow Massacre. See \"Jacob  Hamblin,\" p. 9, and books generally on Mountain Meadow Massacre.]    Of course such a conversion was altogether too miraculous and sudden  to preclude suspicion of Pratt's complicity in the fraud; hence it has  usually been stated that the conversion did not, in fact, take place  until much critical examination, and sometimes, it is said, after much  supplication to the Lord. In Joseph Smith's autobiography he puts the  time of conversion as during Pratt's visit to the Whitmers in Seneca  County. Here are his words: \"_After_ listening to the testimony of the  'witnesses' [at Whitmers, in Seneca County] and reading the 'Book,' he  became convinced that it was of God.\" [125]    [Footnote 125: Supplement 14 _Millennial Star_, 47.]    The \"prophet's\" mother, who, with the mother of the Danite, Orrin  Porter Rockwell, was present at Pratt's alleged first visit to the  Smith home, [126] has a third account of this conversion. Pratt,  according to the account above quoted from his sermon, had not yet  seen the prophet, and had not yet finished reading the Book of Mormon,  but was already converted and had borne testimony to its truth. Now  read Mother Lucy's account as published by Orson Pratt (Parley Pratt's  brother and his first miraculous convert) [127] and \"written by the  direction and under the inspection of the Prophet.\" [128]    [Footnote 126: Pratt's Sermon, 5 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/529"],[0,"Knights of Art: Stories of the Italian Painters (#11)"],[1,"every spare  moment was spent drawing the faces of those who came to the shop, or  even those of the passers-by.    But although, ere long, Ghirlandaio left his father's shop and learned  to make pictures with colours, instead of with gold, silver, and  jewels, still the training he had received in his goldsmith's work  showed to the end in all his pictures. He painted the smallest things  with extreme care, and was never tired of spreading them over with  delicate ornaments and decorations. It is a great deal the outward show  with Ghirlandaio, and not so much the inward soul, that we find in his  pictures, though he had a wonderful gift of painting portraits.    These portraits painted by the young Ghirlandaio seemed very wonderful  to the admiring Florentines. From all his pictures looked out faces  which they knew and recognised immediately. There, in a group of  saints, or in a crowd of figures around the Infant Christ, they saw the  well-known faces of Florentine nobles, the great ladies from the  palaces, ay, and even the men of the market-place, and the poor peasant  women who sold eggs and vegetables in the streets. Once he painted an  old bishop with a pair of spectacles resting on his nose. It was the  first time that spectacles had ever been put into a picture.    Then off he must go to Rome, like every one else, to add his share to  the famous frescoes of the Vatican. But it was in Florence that most of  his work was done.    In the church of Santa Maria Novella there was a great chapel which  belonged to the Ricci family. It had once been covered by beautiful  frescoes, but now it was spoilt by damp and the rain that came through  the leaking roof. The noble family, to whom the chapel belonged, were  poor and could not afford to have the chapel repainted, but neither  would they allow any one else to decorate it, lest it should pass out  of their hands.    Now another noble family, called the Tournabuoni, when they heard of  the fame of the new painter, greatly desired to have a chapel painted  by him in order to do honour to their name and family.    Accordingly they went to the Ricci family and offered to have the whole  chapel painted and to pay the artist themselves. Moreover, they said  that the arms or crest of the Ricci family should be painted in the  most honourable part of the chapel, that all might see that the chapel  still belonged to them.    To this the Ricci family gladly agreed, and Ghirlandaio was set to work  to cover the walls with his frescoes.    'I will give thee twelve hundred gold pieces when it is done,' said  Giovanni Tournabuoni, 'and if I like it well, then shalt thou have two  hundred more.'    Here was good pay indeed. Ghirlandaio set to work with all speed, and  day by day the frescoes grew. For four years he worked hard, from  morning until night, until at last the walls were covered.    One of the subjects which he chose for these frescoes was the story of  the Life of the Virgin, so often painted by Florentine artists. This  story I will tell you now, that your eyes may take greater pleasure in  the pictures when you see them.    The Bible story of the Virgin Mary begins when the Angel Gabriel came  to tell her of the birth of the Baby Jesus, but there are many stories  or legends about her before that time, and this is one which the  Italians specially loved to paint.    Among the blue hills of Galilee, in the little town of Nazareth, there  lived a man and his wife whose names were Joachim and Anna. Though they  were rich and had many flocks of sheep which fed in the rich pastures  around, still there was one thing which God had not given them and  which they longed for more than all beside. They had no child. They had  hoped that God would send one, but now they were both growing old, and  hope began to fade.    Joachim was a very good man, and gave a third of all that he had as an  offering to the temple; but one sad day when he took his gift, the high  priest at the altar refused to take it.    'God has shown that He will have nought of thee,' said the priest,  'since thou hast no child to come after thee.'    Filled with shame and grief Joachim would not go home to his wife, but  instead he wandered out into the far-of fields where his shepherds were  feeding the flocks, and there he stayed forty days. With bowed head and  sad eyes when he was alone, he knelt and prayed that God would tell him  what he had done to deserve this disgrace.    And as he prayed God sent an angel to comfort him.    The angel placed his hand upon the bowed head of the poor old man, and  told him to be of good cheer and to return home at once to his wife.    'For God will even now send thee a child,' said the angel.    So with a thankful heart which never doubted the angel's word, Joachim  turned his face homewards.    Meanwhile, at home, Anna had been sorrowing alone. That same day she  had gone into the garden, and, as she wandered among the flowers, she  wept bitterly and prayed that God would send her comfort. Then there  appeared to her also an angel, who told her that God had heard her  prayer and would send her the child she longed for.    'Go now,' the angel added, 'and meet thy husband Joachim, who is even  now returning to thee, and thou shall find him at the entrance to the  Golden Gate.'    So the husband and wife did as the angel bade them, and met together at  the Golden Gate. And the Angel of Promise hovered above them, and laid  a hand in blessing upon both their heads.    There was no need for speech. As Joachim and Anna looked into each  other's eyes and read there the solemn joy of the angel's message,  their hearts were filled with peace and comfort.    And before long the angel's promise was fulfilled, and a little  daughter was born to Anna and Joachim. In their joy and thankfulness  they said she should not be as other children, but should serve in the  temple as little Samuel had done. The name they gave the child was  Mary, not knowing even then that she was to be the mother of our Lord.    The little maid was but three years old when her parents took her to  present her in the temple. She was such a little child that they almost  feared she might be frightened to go up the steps to the great temple  and meet the high priest alone. So they asked if she might go in  company with the other children who were also on their way to the  temple. But when the little band arrived at the temple steps, Mary  stepped forward and began to climb up, step by step, alone, while the  other children and her parents watched wondering from below. Straight  up to the temple gates she climbed, and stood with little head bent low  to receive the blessing of the great high priest.    So the child was left there to be taught to serve God and to learn how  to embroider the purple and fine linen for the priests' vestments.  Never before had such exquisite embroidery been done as that which  Mary's fingers so delicately stitched, for her work was aided by angel  hands. Sleeping or waking, the blessed angels never left her.    When it was time that the maiden should be married, so many suitors  came to seek her that it was difficult to know which to choose. To  decide the matter they were all told to bring their staves or wands and  leave them in the temple all night, that God might show by a sign who  was the most worthy to be the guardian of the pure young maid.    Now among the suitors was a poor carpenter of Nazareth called Joseph,  who was much older and much poorer than any of the other suitors. They  thought it was foolish of him to bring his staff, nevertheless it was  placed in the temple with the others.    But when the morning came and the priest went into the temple, behold,  Joseph's staff had budded into leaves and flowers, and from among the  blossoms there flew out a dove as white as snow.    So it was known that Joseph was to take charge of the young maid, and  all the rest of the suitors seized their staves and broke them across  their knees in rage and disappointment.    Then the story goes on to the birth of our Saviour as it is told to you  in the Bible.    It was this story which Ghirlandaio painted on the walls of the chapel,  as well as the history of John the Baptist. Then, as Giovanni directed,  he painted the arms of the Tournabuoni on various shields all over the  chapel, and only in the tabernacle of the sacrament on the high altar  he painted a tiny coat of arms of the Ricci family.    The chapel was finished at last and every one flocked to see it, but  first of all came the Ricci, the owners of the chapel.    They looked high and low, but nowhere could they see the arms of their  family. Instead, on all sides, they saw the arms of the Tournabuoni. In  a great rage they hurried to the Council and demanded that Giovanni  Tournabuoni should be punished. But when the facts were explained, and  it was shown that the Ricci arms had indeed been placed in the most  honourable part, they were obliged to be content, though they vowed  vengeance against the Tournabuoni. Neither did Ghirlandaio get his  extra two hundred gold pieces, for although Giovanni was delighted with  the frescoes he never paid the price he had promised.    To the end of his days Ghirlandaio loved nothing so much as to work  from morning till night. Nothing was too small or mean for him to do.  He would even paint the hoops for women's baskets rather than send any  work away from his shop.    'Oh,' he cried, one day, 'how I wish I could paint all the walls around  Florence with my stories.'    But there was no time to do all that. He was only forty-four years old  when Death came and bade him lay down his brushes and pencil, for his  work was done.    Beneath his own frescoes they laid him to rest in the church of Santa  Maria Novella. And although we sometimes miss the soul in his pictures  and weary of the gay outward decoration of goldsmith's work, yet there  is something there which "]]]
