I know them to be      honest, faithful, prayerful workers.--D. S. Tuttle, Bishop      Episcopalian Church.        I never met a people so free from sensualism and immorality of      every kind as the Mormons are. Their habits of life are a thousand      per cent superior to those who denounce them so bitterly.--Mrs.      Olive N. Robinson. (I recommend this to you.)    I assure you there are many others of equal force but this should be  sufficient to prove the scandalous effusions false that you profess to  believe true.      GAGGING AT A KNAT    I am glad you profess to believe the Bible. There is one other  thing which appears strange to me, that is, why you are continually  denouncing Brigham Young and \"Utah Mormonism,\" and calling Utah a  \"land of assassination and a field of blood,\" because vile men without  conscientious scruples have accused the people of many false and lurid  tales of blood, and at the same time with sanctimonious countenance and  upturned eyes you swallow the following without a gulp:        \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts. * * * Now go up and smite Amalek,      and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but      slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel      and ass.\" I Samuel 15:3 (I. T.)    Haven't you swallowed the camel and gagged at his tail?      THE DOCTRINE OF BLOOD ATONEMENT    Just a word or two now, on the subject of blood atonement. _What  is that doctrine_? Unadulterated if you please, laying aside the  pernicious insinuations and lying charges that have so often been  made. It is simply this: Through the atonement of Christ all mankind  may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.  This salvation is two-fold; General,--that which comes to all men  irrespective of a belief in Christ--and Individual,--that which man  merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws  and ordinances of the Gospel. But man may commit certain grievous  sins--according to his light and knowledge--that will place him beyond  the reach of the atoning blood of Christ. If then he would be saved  he must make sacrifice of his own life to atone--so far as in his  power lies--for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain  circumstances will not avail.    Do you believe this doctrine? If not, then I do say you do not believe  in the true doctrine of the atonement of Christ! This is the doctrine  you are pleased to call the \"blood atonement of _Brighamism_.\" This is  the doctrine of Christ our _Redeemer_, who died for us. This is the  doctrine of Joseph Smith, and I accept it.    In whose stead did Christ die? I wish your church members could be fair  enough to discuss this subject on _its merits_.    I again recommend you to a careful reading of the quotations in my  open letter. You will find them as follows: Book of Mormon,--II Nephi  9:35. Alma 1:13, 14, and 42:19. Bible,--Genesis 9:12, 13, (I. T.) Luke  11:50. Hebrews 9:22 and 10:26-29. I John 3:15 and 5:16. Doctrine and  Covenants,--87:7. 101:80. 42:18, 19, 79. (Utah edition.)    To these I will add:        \"Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by      the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against      any person to cause him to die.        Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,      which is guilty of death; but he shall be surely put to death.        So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood      it defileth the land; and the land cannot be cleansed of the      blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed      it.\"--Numbers 35:30, 31, 33. (I. T.)[3]    Do you want a few references of where men were righteously slain to  atone for their sins? What about the death of Nehor? (Alma 1:15)  Zemnariah and his followers (III Nephi 4:27-28). What about Er and  Onan, whom the Lord slew? (Gen. 38:7, 10), of Nadab and Abihu? (Lev.  10:2) and the death of Achan? (Joshua 7:25.)    Were not these righteously slain to atone for their sins? And it was of  this class of cases that President Young referred in his discourse you  misquote (_Journal of Discourses_ 4:220). He tells us so, in the same  discourse in the portion which you _did not quote_. It is:    \"Now take the wicked, and I can refer you to where the Lord had to slay  every soul of the Israelites that went out of Egypt except Caleb and  Joshua. He slew them by the hand of their enemies, by the plague and  by the sword. Why? Because he loved them and promised Abraham he would  save them.\"      POLYGAMY    In using the term \"polygamy\" in reference to the principle that was  taught and practiced by the Saints, I desire it distinctly understood  that I use it in the sense of a man having more than one wife.  Polygamy, in the sense of plurality of husbands and of wives never was  practiced in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah or  elsewhere; but Celestial marriage--including a plurality of wives--was  introduced by the Prophet Joseph Smith and was practiced more generally  by the saints under the administration of President Brigham Young.    You say that you have no evidence that those men, _viz_. Lyman Wight,  James J. Strang, Gladden Bishop, William Smith and others that I  mentioned to you \"practiced _polygamy_\" before plural marriage was  \"introduced\" (as claimed by you) by Brigham Young. You said polygamy  was \"introduced\" eight years after the Prophet's death by Brigham  Young. If so, then why did these men practice it before that time? I  was satisfied that you would not exert yourself in seeking for this  knowledge and tried to help you find the information.      POLYGAMY IN THE \"FACTIONS\"    In a letter written by the President of the Reorganized church by Mr.  Joseph Davis of Wales, dated Lamonia, Oct. 13, 1899, I read:        \"Nearly all the factions into which the church broke had plural      marriage in some form. None in the form instituted by President      Young. Sidney Rigdon had one form practiced by but a few, and that      spasmodically, as an outburst of religious fervor rather than as a      settled practice. William Smith had a sort of Priestess Lodge, in      which it was alleged there was a manifestation of licentiousness.      This he denied, and I never had actual proof of it. Gladden Bishop      taught something like it, but I believe he was himself the only      practioner. James J. Strang had a system something like Mohamet,      four I think, being allowed the king. Lyman Wight had a system but      it had no very extended range. President Young's system you may      know of.\"    It is true that William Smith denied that he taught \"polygamy\" but that  he practiced plural marriage he cannot deny. Jason W. Briggs said he  (William) did, and that is why Mr. Briggs left his church. Plaintiff's  Abstract, Temple Lot suit, p. 395. Hist. of Reorg. Ch. vol. 3:200 and  _The Messenger_, vol. 2. William entered into plural marriage in the  Prophet's day and his wives lived here in Utah. They are Precilla M.  Smith, Sarah Libby and Hannah Libby. One of these is still living.    The third volume of your church history says of Lyman Wight:        \"Lyman Wight lived and died an honorable man, respected well by      those who knew him best. The only thing that can be urged against      his character is that about 1845 or 1846 he entered into the      practice of polygamy, but we have seen no record of any teaching of      his upon the subject.\"    The fact is that Lyman Wight entered into that relation before the time  here mentioned. Affidavits in this regard can be produced but it will  be unnecessary.    That John E. Page practiced \"polygamy\" I have the testimony of his  wife, Mrs. Mary Eaton of Independence, who told me and others, in  August 1904, that she _gave her husband_, John E. Page, other wives.    These men did not follow Brigham Young, but denounced him, yet they  practiced plural marriage and did not get that doctrine from him.      THE TESTIMONY OF A BOGUS WIFE    The \"testimony\" you submit from President Young's \"legal wife\" is  spurious. It matters not if you did receive the \"information\" from  your uncle. The poor man was tricked and deceived. Bogus \"wives\" and  \"daughters\" of President Young have \"worked\" the public before. Mary  Ann Angel Young, President Young's legal wife, was not in Colorado in  1860 and 1861. She never was divorced and died in this city true to  her husband, his family and the faith, on the 27th day of June, 1882.  (_News_, July 5, 1882.) So much for this \"bogus\" testimony.      TESTIMONY IMPEACHED    The testimony of T. B. H. and Fanny Stenhouse is sufficiently impeached  in the _Saints' Herald_, vol. 52, p. 2; 20, p. 602, and _Sinners and  Saints_, p. 245. The woman's bitterness would condemn her writings.  However I will mention one statement--you make Mrs. Stenhouse say:  \"It is reported by Fanny Stenhouse and many others, that Joseph  Smith said, 'If ever the Church had the misfortune to be led by Bro.  Brigham, he would lead it to hell.'\" She gives this as a rumor that is  \"reported,\" so do the \"many others\" who are mostly from your church.  Oh, yes, I have heard of this before. But do you know where the report  originated? It originated with the apostate and would-be assassin,  Robert D. Foster, who threatened the Prophet Joseph's life in 1844,  and who was one of the incorporators and advocates of the notorious  _Nauvoo Expositor_, and one of the chief actors in bringing about the  martyrdom, June 27, 1844. In a toadying letter to your president, dated  February 14, 1874, he said the prophet \"remarked, in the presence of  Mr. Law, Bishop Knight, John P. Greene, Reynolds Cahoon, and some  others, that if ever Brigham Young became the leader of the Church, he  would lead them down to hell.\"      MARVELOUS GROWTH OF THE CHURCH    I decline to accept the statements of such a character;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],[0,"Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#11)"],[1,"in their hearts, and they taste the bitter,  that they may know to prize the good.    \"And it is given unto them to know good from evil; wherefore they are  agents unto themselves, and I have given unto you another law and  commandment.    \"Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must  repent, or they can in no wise inherit the kingdom of God, for no  unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence; for, in the  language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only  Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who  shall come in the meridian of time.    \"Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely  unto your children, saying:    \"That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth  death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water and blood,  and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of dust a living soul,  even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and  of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only  Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words  of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come,  even immortal glory;    \"For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the Spirit ye are  justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified.\" (Moses 6:55-60.)    Early Christian Views.--The earliest Christians did not doubt the  necessity of baptism. On the contrary, they strongly insisted upon it,  as indispensable to a saved condition. During the Patristic age--that  of the early fathers, following the apostles--the conviction that  no soul could be saved without baptism was so firm that it led to  pedobaptism--the baptism of infants, and to other innovations upon  the primitive faith. It was seen that infants could not believe in  Christ, nor repent of sins that they had not committed; but it was  held that the church, or those who stood sponsor for the little ones,  could believe for them, and they were baptized for original sin, the  sin of Adam, which they were supposed to have inherited. Peter's words  in promising the Holy Ghost: \"For the promise is unto you and to your  children\" (Acts 2:39), were construed to sustain infant baptism. It was  even assumed that the Savior authorized it in saying, \"Suffer little  children to come unto me,\" the inference being that they could come  unto him only by baptism.    Pedobaptism.--Holders of these ideas have never explained why infant  baptism did not become prevalent until two or three centuries after  Christ, and why such eminent Christians of the fourth century as  Gregory, of Nazianzum, the son of a bishop; Basil the Great, of  Cappadocia; Chrysostom of Antioch, and Augustine of Numidia--whose  mothers were the most pious of Christians--were not baptized until  they were over thirty years of age. Paul's affirmation that \"children  are holy\" (1 Cor. 7:14), the Savior's declaration, \"Of such is the  kingdom of heaven,\" and Mormon's words to Moroni, already cited, are  a sufficient answer to the assumption that children under the age of  accountability have need to be baptized. Those who introduced the  practice of baptizing infants for original sin, overlooked the fact  that Christ atoned for original guilt, and that men are accountable for  their own sins and not for Adam's transgression.    Other Innovations.--One innovation led to another, though the next  related to adults. What was to become of martyrs, who had shed their  blood in defense of the church, or for its sake, but had never  confessed Christ nor been baptized? Were they to be damned? Oh, no;  for their benefit another doctrine was introduced; they were held to  have been baptized in their own blood. Finally, out of deference to  the claims of a far more numerous class--worthy men and women, many of  whom had lived and died before the Christian Church was founded, while  others, though living contemporaneously with it, were never reached  by its missionaries--the idea gradually obtained that baptism was not  essential to salvation. All of which might have been obviated, and the  Church spared much ridicule and skepticism--the result of its ramblings  and inconsistencies--had it kept the key to the situation--namely,  baptism for the dead.    Gradual Growth of a Heresy.--The idea that baptism is nonessential did  not become fixed and popular until many centuries after the apostles  fell asleep. Saint Augustine, who figured in the latter part of the  fourth and the first half of the fifth century after Christ, and  who advanced the notion that water baptism was \"the outward sign of  an inward grace,\" the external emblem of internal sanctification,  held, nevertheless, that no soul could be saved without it--not even  infants; though their condemnation, resulting from non-baptism, would  be of the mildest character. Augustine's concept of baptism, with some  modifications, is the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and of the  orthodox Protestant churches, at the present time. Luther held baptism  to be essential to salvation; Calvin and Zwingli did not; and there,  in the sixteenth century, it appears, began the schism of opinion  concerning it that divides Christendom today.    Baptism for the Dead.--That baptism is required from all capable of  exercising faith and manifesting repentance is shown by the fact that  provision is made in the gospel for the baptism of those who pass away  without being baptized for themselves. In the spirit world, where the  gospel is preached and the powers of the priesthood are exercised,  faith and repentance are possible--but baptism is not, it being an  outward ordinance, having to do with a temporal element--water--and  therefore to be administered in a temporal world. Since it is the soul  that is baptized, not the spirit alone, baptism is impracticable in the  world of spirits.    Spirits in Prison.--Peter's testimony concerning Christ's preaching  to \"the spirits in prison\" during the interval between his death and  resurrection--spirits disobedient in the days of Noah, swept off by the  deluge, and immured in eternal dungeons to await a day of deliverance;  the apostle's figurative use of the ark and flood as symbols of  baptism, that \"doth also now save us;\" and his further statement that  \"for this cause was the gospel also preached to them that are dead,  that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live  according to God in the spirit,\" are too well known to need dwelling  upon (1 Pet.3:18-21;4:6).    Vicarious Baptism During and After Paul's Time.--That baptism for  the dead was practiced in the Church of Christ during Paul's time is  evident from his oft-quoted words: \"Else what shall they do which are  baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then  baptized for the dead?\" (1 Cor. 15:29). That the practice continued  after Paul's time, among some of the Christians of Asia, we learn from  Epiphanius, a writer of the fourth century. It was forbidden by the  Council of Carthage, A. D. 397.    Vicarious work, when authorized of God, is acceptable to him. This  should not startle the Christian mind, when it is remembered that  the whole fabric of Christianity rests upon the vicarious work done  by Jesus Christ for the redemption and salvation of those who were  powerless to redeem and save themselves. Men cannot answer by proxy  for the deeds done in the body, but there have always been ceremonies  in the Church of Christ that one person might perform for another. The  priest who ministers in behalf of the people is a type of the Great  Mediator, \"our only access unto God.\"    If baptism had not been essential to salvation, Christ would not have  told Nicodemus what he did; the apostles would not have been sent to  \"baptize all nations;\" Peter, Paul, and other servants of God, would  not have commanded Jews and Gentiles to be baptized, nor would they  have emphasized the necessity of baptism in their writings. Moreover,  they would not have troubled themselves about baptism for the dead, had  it not been necessary for man's eternal welfare.        CHAPTER VI.    Purpose and Effects of Baptism.    For the Remission of Sins.--Baptism is the divinely instituted process  by which sins, when truly repented of, are remitted; that is, forgiven  and washed away. All men have sinned; and in order to bring them back  into his pure presence, where nothing sinful can come, it is necessary  that they first be cleansed from sin. Water baptism is the beginning of  the cleansing process.    Means and Accessories.--Water, of itself, cannot, of course, wash away  sin. It was not water that cleansed Naaman of his leprosy. It was his  obedience to the prophet who directed him to go and dip seven times in  the Jordan. Had he dipped but once, or but six times, his leprosy would  still have clung to him. But he did as he was told--dipped seven times,  and his faith, shown by his obedience, worked the cure, bringing down  the power of God for that purpose. The water was the medium through  which the power operated. Likewise, when Christ anointed the eyes of  the blind man, causing him to see, it was faith--the power of God--that  wrought the miracle; but the clay used was an accessory, as consecrated  oil was (James 5:14,15) and is still, in the healing ordinance of the  Church.    Water and Spirit.--Baptism cleanses and illumines the soul, and  the water and the spirit are divinely appointed means by which the  cleansing and the illumination come. And they are indispensable  in the process. The sick may be healed without the use of oil,  without even the laying on of hands; for it is faith that heals, not  instrumentalities employed; but no sinner can be baptized, without the  Water and the Spirit. By baptism we are as effectually freed from sin,  and our moral status changed, as by death, burial and resurrection we"]]]
