What a ray streams        From the ash-tree's stem!        My eyes that saw not        See the bright flash;    Gay as laughter it gleams.        How the radiant light        Illumes my heart!        Is it the look        That lingered behind,        Yonder clinging,        When forth from the hall    The lovely woman went?            [_From this point the fire gradually goes out._          Darkly the shadows        Covered my eyes,        Till her shining glance        Over me gleamed,    Bringing me warmth and day.        Gay and splendid        The sun appeared,        And blissfully circled        With glory my head--    Till by the hills it was hid.            [_The fire flickers up faintly again._      But once more, ere it set,    Bright it shone upon me,    And the ancient ash-tree's stem    Was lit by its golden glow.        The splendour passes,        The light grows dim,        Shadowy darkness        Falls and enshrouds me;    Deep in my bosom's fastness    Glimmers still faintly the flame!            [_The fire goes out altogether. Total darkness.          The door of the bed-chamber opens noiselessly.          Sieglinde comes out in a white garment and advances          softly but quickly towards the hearth._    SIEGLINDE          Art asleep?    SIEGMUND [_Joyfully surprised._          Who steals this way?    SIEGLINDE [_With stealthy haste._      'Tis I: listen to me!    In sleep profound lies Hunding;    The draught that I mixed him I drugged.    Use to good purpose the night!    SIEGMUND [_Ardently interrupting._      Thou here, all is well!    SIEGLINDE      I have come to show thee a weapon;    O couldst thou make it thine!        I then might call thee        First among heroes,        For only by him        Can it be won.    O hearken: heed what I tell thee!        Here Hunding's kinsmen        Sat in the hall,    Assembled to honour his wedding.        He took as his wife,        Against her will,    One who was bartered by thieves.        Sad I sat there        Through their carousing.    A stranger entered the hall,    An old and grey-coated man.    So slouched was his hat    That one of his eyes was hidden;        But the other flashed        So that all feared it:        Overwhelming        Its menace they found;        I alone        Suffered, when looked on,    Sweet pain, sad delight,    Sorrow and solace in one.        On me glancing,        He scowled at the others,    As he swung a sword in his hands.        This sword he plunged        In the ash-tree's stem,    To the hilt driving it home.    The weapon he gains in guerdon    Who draws it from its place.        Though sore they struggled,        Not one of the heroes    Could win the weapon for his;        Coming, going,        The guests essayed it,    The strongest tugged at the steel;    Not an inch it stirred in the stem;    In silence yonder it cleaves.    I knew then who he was    That in sorrow greeted me.        I know too        Now for whom    The sword was stuck in the tree.        O might I to-day        Find here the friend        Brought from afar        By a woman's woe!        Then all I have suffered        In sorrow untold,        All scorn and all shame        In anger endured--        All would avenged be,        Sweetly atoned for--        Regained fully        The good I had lost;        For mine I should win        All I had wept for,    Could I but find the dear friend,    And clasp him close in my arms!    SIEGFRIED [_Embracing Sieglinde with passionate ardour._          Dear woman, that friend        Holds thee at last,    Both woman and sword are his.        Here in my breast        Burns hot the oath    That welds us twain into one.        For all that I sought        I see now in thee,        In thee all        That once failed me I find.        Thou wert despised,        My portion was pain;        I was an outlaw,        Dishonoured wert thou;        Sweet revenge beckons,        Bids us be joyful;        I laugh        From sheer fulness of joy,    Holding thee, love, in my arms thus,    Feeling the beat of thy heart!            [_The outer door swings open._    SIEGLINDE [_With a start of alarm tears herself away._      Ha, who went? Who entered there?            [_The door remains open. Outside a glorious spring          night. The full moon shines in, throwing its bright          light on the pair, so that they can suddenly see          one another quite plainly._    SIEGMUND [_In soft ecstasy._        No one went--      But one has come:      Laughing the spring      Enters the hall!            [_He draws Sieglinde with tender force on to the          couch, so that she sits beside him. The moon shines          more and more brightly._          Winter storms have yielded        To May's sweet moon,        And mild and radiant        Sparkles the spring.        On balmy breezes        Light and lovely,        Weaving wonders,        Soft she sways.        Through field and forest        She is breathing;        Wide and open        Laughs her eye;    When blithe the birds are singing        Sounds her voice;        Fragrant odours        She exhales;    From her warm blood blossom flowers        Welcome and joyous.        Shoot and bud,        They wax by her aid.    With tender weapons armed,        She conquers the world.        Winter and storm yield        To the strong attack.    No wonder that, beaten boldly,    At last the door should have opened,        Which, stubborn and stiff,    Was keeping her out.        To find her sister        Hither she came;    By love has spring been allured;        Within our bosoms        Buried she lay;    Now glad she laughs to the light.        The bride who is sister        Is freed by the brother;        In ruin lies        What held them apart.        Loud rejoicing,        They meet and greet;    Lo! Love is mated with spring!    SIEGLINDE          Thou art the spring        That I used to pine for,    When pinched by the winter frost;        My heart hailed thee friend        With bliss and with fear,    When thy first glance fell on me sweetly    All I had seen appeared strange;    Friendless were my surroundings;    I never seemed to have known    Any one who came nigh.        Thee, however,        Straightway I knew,        And I saw thou wert mine        When I beheld thee:        What I hid in my heart,        All I am,        Clear as the day        Dawned to my sight        Like tones to the ear        Echoing back,    When, upon my frosty desert,    My eyes first beheld a friend.            [_She hangs enraptured on his neck, and looks him          close in the face._    SIEGMUND [_Transported._          O rapture most blissful!        Woman most blest!    SIEGLINDE [_Close to his eyes._          O let me, closer        And closer clinging,        Discern more clearly        The sacred light        That from thine eyes        And face shines forth,    And so sweetly sways every sense!    SIEGMUND          The May-moon's light        Falls on thy face        Framed by masses        Of waving hair.        What snared my heart        'Tis easy to guess:    My gaze on loveliness feasts.    SIEGLINDE [_Pushing the hair back from his brow,          regards him with astonishment._          How broad and open        Is thy brow!        Blue-branching the veins        In thy temples entwine.        I hardly can endure        My burden of bliss.--    Of something I am reminded:--    The man I first saw to-day    Already I have seen!    SIEGMUND          A dream of love        I too recall;        I saw thee there        And yearned for thee sore!    SIEGLINDE          The stream has shown me        My imaged face--    Again I see it before me;    As in the pool it arose    It is reflected by thee.    SIEGMUND          Thine is the face        I hid in my heart.    SIEGLINDE [_Quickly averting her gaze._          O hush! That voice!        O let me listen!        These tones as a child        Surely I heard--    But no! I heard the sound lately,    When, calling in the wood,    My voice re-echoing rang.    SIEGMUND          To sweet and melodious        Music I listen!    SIEGLINDE [_Gazing into his eyes again._          And ere now thy glowing        Eye have I seen:        The old man whose glance        Solaced my grief,    When he greeted me had that eye--        I knew him        Because of his eye,    And almost addressed him as father.            [_After a pause._      Art thou Wehwalt in truth?    SIEGMUND          If dear to thee,        Wehwalt no more;    My sway is o'er bliss not sorrow!    SIEGLINDE          And Friedmund does not        Fit with thy fortunes.    SIEGMUND          Choose thou the name        Thou wouldst have me be known by:    Thy choice will also be mine!    SIEGLINDE      The name of thy father was Wölfe?    SIEGMUND      A wolf to the fearful foxes!        But he whose eye        Shone with the brightness    Which, fairest one, shines in thine own,    Was named--Wälse of old.    SIEGLINDE [_Beside herself._          Was Wälse thy father,        And art thou a Wälsung?--        Stuck was for thee        His sword in the stem?--        Then let my love call thee        What it has found thee;        Siegmund        Shall be thy name.    SIEGMUND [_Springs up._          Siegmund call me        For Siegmund am I!        Be witness this sword        I grasp without shrinking!        That I should find it        In sorest need        Wälse foretold.        I grasp it now!        Love the most pure        In utmost need,        Passionate love,        Consuming desire    Burning bright in my breast,    Drive to deeds and death!"]]]
