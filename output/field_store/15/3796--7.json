He had almost dozed off when a new voice cut through the murmur and  woke him. It was a voice he knew, and the accent was a familiar  accent.    \"Gents! Excuse me.\"    He looked up. The mists of sleep shredded away. A ragged youth with  a crop of fiery red hair was standing in the doorway, regarding the  occupants of the shelter with a grin, half-whimsical, half-defiant.    Jimmy recognized him. It was Spike Mullins.    \"Excuse me,\" said Spike Mullins. \"Is dere any gent in dis bunch of  professional beauts wants to give a poor orphan dat suffers from a  painful toist something to drink? Gents is courteously requested not  to speak all in a crowd.\"    \"Shet that blanky door,\" said the mummy cabman, sourly.    \"And 'op it,\" added his late opponent. \"We don't want none of your  sort 'ere.\"    \"Den you ain't my long-lost brudders after all,\" said the newcomer,  regretfully. \"I t'ought youse didn't look handsome enough for dat.  Good-night to youse, gents.\"    \"Shet that door, can't yer, when I'm telling yer!\" said the mummy,  with increased asperity.    Spike was reluctantly withdrawing, when Jimmy rose.    \"One moment,\" he said.    Never in his life had Jimmy failed to stand by a friend in need.  Spike was not, perhaps, exactly a friend, but even an acquaintance  could rely on Jimmy when down in the world. And Spike was manifestly  in that condition.    A look of surprise came into the Bowery Boy's face, followed by one  of stolid woodenness. He took the sovereign that Jimmy held out to  him with a muttered word of thanks, and shuffled out of the room.    \"Can't see what you wanted to give him anything for,\" said Lord  Dreever. \"Chap'll only spend it getting soused.\"    \"Oh, he reminded me of a man I used to know.\"    \"Did he? Barnum's what-is-it, I should think,\" said his lordship.  \"Shall we be moving?\"          CHAPTER X    JIMMY ADOPTS A LAME DOG      A black figure detached itself from the blacker shadows, and  shuffled stealthily to where Jimmy stood on the doorstep.    \"That you, Spike?\" asked Jimmy.    \"Dat's right, boss.\"    \"Come on in.\"    He led the way up to his rooms, switched on the electric light, and  shut the door. Spike stood blinking at the sudden glare. He twirled  his battered hat in his hands. His red hair shone fiercely.    Jimmy inspected him out of the corner of his eye, and came to the  conclusion that the Mullins finances must be at a low ebb. Spike's  costume differed in several important details from that of the  ordinary well-groomed man about town. There was nothing of the  flaneur about the Bowery Boy. His hat was of the soft black felt  fashionable on the East Side of New York. It was in poor condition,  and looked as if it had been up too late the night before. A black  tail-coat, burst at the elbows and stained with mud, was tightly  buttoned across his chest, this evidently with the idea of  concealing the fact that he wore no shirt--an attempt which was not  wholly successful. A pair of gray flannel trousers and boots out of  which two toes peeped coyly completed the picture.    Even Spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his  appearance which would have distressed the editor of a men's  fashion-paper.    \"'Scuse these duds,\" he said. \"Me man's bin an' mislaid de trunk  wit' me best suit in. Dis is me number two.\"    \"Don't mention it, Spike,\" said Jimmy. \"You look a perfect matinee  idol. Have a drink?\"    Spike's eyes gleamed as he reached for the decanter. He took a seat.    \"Cigar, Spike?\"    \"Sure. T'anks, boss.\"    Jimmy lighted his pipe. Spike, after a few genteel sips, threw off  his restraint, and finished the rest of his glass at a gulp.    \"Try another,\" suggested Jimmy.    Spike's grin showed that the idea had been well received.    Jimmy sat and smoked in silence for a while. He was thinking the  thing over. He felt like a detective who has found a clue. At last,  he would be able to discover the name of the Lusitania girl. The  discovery would not take him very far certainly, but it would be  something. Possibly, Spike might even be able to fix the position of  the house they had broken into that night.    Spike was looking at Jimmy over his glass in silent admiration. This  flat which Jimmy had rented for a year, in the hope that the  possession of a fixed abode might help to tie him down to one spot,  was handsomely, even luxuriously, furnished. To Spike, every chair  and table in the room had a romance of its own, as having been  purchased out of the proceeds of that New Asiatic Bank robbery, or  from the revenue accruing from the Duchess of Havant's jewels. He  was dumb with reverence for one who could make burglary pay to this  extent. In his own case, the profession had rarely provided anything  more than bread and butter, and an occasional trip to Coney Island.    Jimmy caught his eye, and spoke.    \"Well, Spike,\" he said. \"Curious that we should meet like this?\"    \"De limit,\" agreed Spike.    \"I can't imagine you three thousand miles from New York. How do you  know the cars still run both ways on Broadway?\"    A wistful look came into Spike's eyes.    \"I've been dis side t'ree months. I t'ought it was time I give old  Lunnon a call. T'ings was gettin' too fierce in Noo York. De cops  was layin' fer me. Dey didn't seem like as if they had any use fer  me. So, I beat it.\"    \"Bad luck,\" said Jimmy.    \"Fierce,\" agreed Spike.    \"Say, Spike,\" said Jimmy, \"do you know, I spent a whole heap of time  before I left New York looking for you?\"    \"Gee! I wish you'd found me! Did youse want me to help on some lay,  boss? Is it a bank, or--jools?\"    \"Well, no, not that. Do you remember that night we broke into that  house uptown--the police-captain's house?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"What was his name?\"    \"What, de cop's? Why, McEachern, boss.\"    \"McWhat? How do you spell it?\"    \"Search me,\" said Spike, simply.    \"Say it again. Fill your lungs, and enunciate slowly and clearly. Be  bell-like. Now.\"    \"McEachern.\"    \"Ah! And where was the house? Can you remember that?\"    Spike's forehead wrinkled.    \"It's gone,\" he said, at last. \"It was somewheres up some street up  de town.\"    \"That's a lot of help,\" said Jimmy. \"Try again.\"    \"It'll come back some time, boss, sure.\"    \"Then, I'm going to keep an eye on you till it does. Just for the  moment, you're the most important man in the world to me. Where are  you living?\"    \"Me! Why, in de Park. Dat's right. One of dem swell detached benches  wit' a Southern exposure.\"    \"Well, unless you prefer it, you needn't sleep in the Park any more.  You can pitch your moving tent with me.\"    \"What, here, boss?\"    \"Unless we move.\"    \"Me fer dis,\" said Spike, rolling luxuriously in his chair.    \"You'll want some clothes,\" said Jimmy. \"We'll get those to-morrow.  You're the sort of figure they can fit off the peg. You're not too  tall, which is a good thing.\"    \"Bad t'ing fer me, boss. If I'd been taller, I'd have stood fer  being a cop, an' bin buyin' a brownstone house on Fifth Avenue by  dis. It's de cops makes de big money in little old Manhattan, dat's  who it is.\"    \"The man who knows!\" said Jimmy. \"Tell me more, Spike. I suppose a  good many of the New York force do get rich by graft?\"    \"Sure. Look at old man McEachern.\"    \"I wish I could. Tell me about him, Spike. You seemed to know him  pretty well.\"    \"Me? Sure. Dere wasn't a woise old grafter dan him in de bunch. He  was out fer de dough all de time. But, say, did youse ever see his  girl?\"    \"What's that?\" said Jimmy, sharply.    \"I seen her once.\" Spike became almost lyrical in his enthusiasm.  \"Gee! She was a boid--a peach fer fair. I'd have left me happy home  fer her. Molly was her monaker. She--\"    Jimmy was glaring at him.    \"Cut it out!\" he cried.    \"What's dat, boss?\" said Spike.    \"Cut it out!\" said Jimmy, savagely.    Spike looked at him, amazed.    \"Sure,\" he said, puzzled, but realizing that his words had not  pleased the great man.    Jimmy chewed the stem of his pipe irritably, while Spike, full of  excellent intentions, sat on the edge of his chair, drawing  sorrowfully at his cigar and wondering what he had done to give  offense.    \"Boss?\" said Spike.    \"Well?\"    \"Boss, what's doin' here? Put me next to de game. Is it de old lay?  Banks an' jools from duchesses? You'll be able to let me sit in at  de game, won't you?\"    Jimmy laughed.    \"I'd quite forgotten I hadn't told you about myself, Spike. I've  retired.\"    The horrid truth sank slowly into the other's mind.    \"Say! What's dat, boss? You're cuttin' it out?\"    \"That's it. Absolutely.\"    \"Ain't youse swiping no more jools?\"    \"Not me.\"    \"Nor usin' de what's-its-name blow-pipe?\"    \"I have sold my oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, given away my anaesthetics,  and am going to turn over a new leaf, and settle down as a  respectable citizen.\"    Spike gasped. His world had fallen about his ears. His excursion  with. Jimmy, the master cracksman, in New York had been the highest  and proudest memory of his life; and, now that they had met again in  London, he had looked forward to a long and prosperous partnership  in crime. He was content that his own share in the partnership  should be humble. It was enough for him to be connected, however  humbly, with such a master. He had looked upon the richness of  London, and he had said with Blucher, \"What a city to loot!\"    And here was his idol shattering the visions with a word.    \"Have another drink, Spike,\" said the lost leader sympathetically.  \"It's a shock to you, I guess.\"    \"I t'ought, boss--\"    \"I know, I know. These are life's tragedies. I'm very sorry for you.  But it can't be helped. I've made my pile, so why continue?\"    Spike sat silent, with a long face. Jimmy slapped him on the  shoulder.    \"Cheer up,\" he said. \"How do you know that living honestly may not  be splendid fun? Numbers of people do it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#11)"],[1," king's officer's deputy or a royal  priest, let him pay 30 shillings by way of fine.  39. If someone starts a fight on the floor of a free man's house, let  him pay compensation of six shillings to the freeman. If he draws his  weapon but does not fight, let the compensation be half that. If either  of these offences takes place in the house of a 600 shilling wergeld  man, let the rate rise to triple the compensation due the freeman. In  the case of a 1200 shilling wergeld man, a rate twice that of the  compensation of the 600 shilling wergeld man.  40. For breaking into a royal residence the penalty shall be 120  shillings. Into an archbishop's, ninety shillings. Into another  bishop's or a royal officer's, 60 shillings. Into a 1200 shilling  werwgeld man's, thirty shillings. Into a 600 shilling wergeld man's  fifteen shillings. For breaking into a freeman's property the penalty  shall be five shillings. If something of this kind takes place while  the levy [fyrd] is on duty elsewhere, or during Lent, let it be a  double compensation. If someone sets aside holy custom publicly in Lent  without an exemption, let him pay a compensation of 120 shillings.  41. The man who has charter land [bocland] which his kin left him, is  not allowed, we enact, to part with it outside his kin-group, if there  is written evidence or spoken witness that it was forbidden to be done  by those people who originally acquired it or by those who passed it to  him. Let him i.e. the one who opposes the alienation process declare  any such stipulation in the presence of the king and the bishop, with  his own kin attending.  42. Also we command that the man who knows his enemy is quiescent at  home should not start a fight before he has asked him for justice. If  he has the strength to surround his enemy and besiege him, let him  contain him for 7 days within and not attack him if he i.e. the enemy  is willing to abide within. After seven days if he is willing to  surrender and hand over his weapons, let him i.e. the avenger keep him  unharmed for thirty days and inform his kinsmen and his friends about  him. But if he i.e. the enemy flee to a church, let the matter be  resolved according to the privilege of the church, as we detailed  above. But if he i.e. the avenger does not have the resources to  besiege him i.e. the enemy, let him ride to the royal officer and ask  him for help. If he i.e. the officer is unwilling to assist, let him  ride and ask the king, before he mounts an attack.  Further, if someone happen upon his enemy and did not know beforehand  that he was quiescent at home, if he i.e. the enemy is willing to hand  over his weapons, let him be held for thirty days and inform his  friends about him; if he is not willing to hand over his weapons then  he i.e. the avenger may attack him. If he i.e. the enemy is willing to  surrender and hand over his weapons and yet someone still attacks him,  let the aggressor pay over wergeld and wound compensation, according to  what he has done, and pay a fine, and lose his kin-status.  We also declare someone may fight in support of his lord without blame,  if anyone has attacked the lord; so too the lord may fight in support  of his follower. In the same way, someone may fight on behalf of his  blood relative if someone attack him wrongfully, but not take the side  of a kinsman against his lord - that we do not permit. Someone may  fight blamelessly if he discovers another with his lawful wife behind  closed doors or under the one cover, or with his legitimate daughter,  or with his legitimate sister or with his mother if she was given  lawfully to his father.  43. To all free people let these following days be granted as holidays  but not to slaves and servile workers; twelve days at Christmas and the  day that Christ overcame the Devil, and St. Gregory's commemoration  day, and seven days before Easter and seven after, and one day at the  celebration of St. Peter and St. Paul and the full week in harvest  before St. Mary's Mass, and one day for the celebration of All Hallows.  The four Wednesdays in the Ember weeks shall be granted to all slaves  to sell to anyone that pleases them to anything either that any man  will give them in God's name or what they in any spare time can manage.\"  44.-77. The compensations for wounds is as follows: head if both bones  of the head be pierced 30s., head if the outer bone only be pierced  15s.; an inch long wound in the area of the hair 1s., an inch long  wound in the front of the hair 2s.; striking off the other ear 30s., if  the hearing be affected so that he cannot hear 60s.; putting out an eye  60s. 6 1/3 d., if the eye stay in the head but he can see nothing with  it 1/3 of the compensation be remitted; striking off a nose 60s.;  striking a front tooth 8s., a back tooth 4s., a canine tooth 15s.;  severing cheeks 15s., breaking a chin bone 12s.; perforating a windpipe  12s.; removing a tongue the same compensatin for any eye; wounding in  the shoulder so that the muscle fluid flows out 30s.; shattering the  arm above the elbow 15s.; shattering both arm bones 30s.; striking off  the thumb 30s., if the nail is struck off 5s.; striking off the  forefinger 15s., for the nail 4s.; striking off the middle finger 12s.,  for the nail 2s.; striking off the ring finger 17s., for the nail 4s.;  striking off the little finger 9s., for the nail 1s.; wounding in the  belly 30s., if the wound go through the body 20s. for each opening;  perforating the thigh or hip 30s., if it be disabled 30s.; piercing the  leg below the knee 12s., if he  is disabled below the knee 30s.;  striking off the great toe 20s., the second toe 15s., the middle toe  9s., the fourth toe 6s., the little toe 5s.; wounding in the testicles  so that he cannot bear children 80s.; cutting off the arm below the  elbow with the hand cut off 80s., wounding before the hair-line and  below the sleeve and below the knee twice the value; permanently  damaging the loins 60s., it they are stabbed 15s., if they are pierced  through 30s.; wounding in the shoulder if the victim be alive 80s.;  maiming a hand outwardly, providing it can be treated effectively 20s.,  if half the hand be lost 40s.; breaking a rib without breaking the skin  10s., if the skin be broken and the bone be extruded 15s.; cutting away  an eye hand or foot 66s.6 1/3 d.; cutting off the leg at the knee 80s.;  breaking a shoulder 20s.; hacking into a shoulder so that the bone  extrudes 15s.; severing the tendon of the foot and if it can be treated  so that will be sound again 12s., but if he is lame on account of the  wound and he cannot be cured 30s.; severing the lesser tendon 6s.;  severing the muscles up by the neck and damage them so severely that he  has no control over them and however lives on thus maimed 100s., unless  the Witan appoint him a juster and greater sum.                    Judicial Procedure            Cases were held at monthly meetings of the hundred court. The  king or one of his reeves, conducted the trial by compurgation, which  was an appeal to the supernatural.            In compurgation, the one complaining, called the \"plaintiff\",  and the one defending, called the \"defendant\", each told their story  and put his hand on the Bible and swore \"By God this oath is clean and  true\". A slip or a stammer would mean he lost the case. Otherwise,  community members would stand up to swear on behalf of the plaintiff or  the defendant as to their reputation for veracity. The value of a man's  oath was commensurate with his value or wergeld. A man's brothers were  usually his compurgators. The number of compurgators varied according  to the nature of the case and the rank of the persons concerned. If  there were too few \"compurgators\", usually twelve in number, or recited  poorly, their party lost. If this process was inconclusive, the parties  could bring witnesses to declare such knowledge as they had as  neighbors. These witnesses, male and female, swore to particular points  determined by the court.            If compurgation failed, the defendant was told to go to church  and to take the sacrament only if he was innocent. If he took the  sacrament, he was tried by the process of \"ordeal\", which was  administered by the church. In the ordeal by cold water, he was given a  drink of holy water and then bound hand and foot and thrown into water.  If he floated, he was guilty beccause the holy water had rejected him.  If he sank, he was innocent. It was not necessary to drown to be deemed  innocent. In the ordeal by hot water, he had to pick up a stone from  inside a boiling cauldron. If his hand was healing in three days, he  was innocent. If it was festering, he was guilty. A similar ordeal was  that of hot iron, in which one had to carry in his hands a hot iron for  a certain distance. In the ordeal of the consecrated morsel, one would  swallow a morsel; if he choked on it, he was guilty. The results of the  ordeal were taken to indicate the will of God.            An archbishop's or bishop's oath was incontrovertible. If they  were accused, they could clear themselves with an oath that they were  guiltless. Lesser ranks could clear themselves with the oaths of at  least three compurgators of their rank or, for more serious offenses,  undergo the ordeal.              The shire and hundred courts were held for free tenants of a  lord and the judges were the tenants themselves. The feudal courts were  held for unfree tenants and the lord or his steward was the judge.            The earl presided over the shire court. He received one-third  of the profits of justice. The judges were the owners of certain pieces  of land. The shire court was held twice a year. There was little  distinction between secular and spiritual jurisdiction.  A bishop sat  on the shire court. The shire court fulfilled all three functions of  government: judicial, legislative, and executive.            The courts had no efficient mode of"]]]
