Therefore, we will briefly explain these three works.    II. In the mass it is necessary that we attend with our a hearts also;  and we do attend, when we exercise faith in our hearts.  Here we must  repeat the words of Christ, when He institutes the mass and says, \"Take  and eat, this is My Body, which is given for you\"; in like manner over  the cup, \"Take and drink ye all of it: this is a new, everlasting  Testament in My Blood, which is shed for you and for many for the  remission of sins. This shall ye do, as oft as ye do it, in remembrance  of Me.\" In these words Christ has made for Himself a memorial or  anniversary, to be daily observed in all Christendom, and has added to  it a glorious, rich, great testament, in which no interest, money or  temporal possessions are bequeathed and distributed, but the  forgiveness of all sins, grace and mercy unto eternal life, that all  who come to this memorial shall have the same testament; and then He  died, whereby this testament has become permanent and irrevocable. In  proof and evidence of which, instead of letter and seal, He has left  with us His own Body and Blood under the bread and wine.    Here there is need that a man practise the first works of this  Commandment right well, that he doubt not that what Christ has said is  true, and consider the testament sure, so that he make not Christ a  liar. For if you are present at mass and do not consider nor believe  that here Christ through His testament has bequeathed and given you  forgiveness of all your sins, what else is it, than as if you said: \"I  do not know or do not believe that it is true that forgiveness of my  sins is here bequeathed and given me\"? Oh, how many masses there are in  the world at present!  but how few who hear them with such faith and  benefit! Most grievously is God provoked to anger thereby. For this  reason also no one shall or can reap any benefit from the mass except  he be in trouble of soul and long for divine mercy, and desire to be  rid of his sins; or, if he have an evil intention, he must be changed  during the mass, and come to have a desire for this testament. For this  reason in olden times no open sinner was allowed to be present at the  mass.    When this faith is rightly present, the heart must be made joyful by  the testament, and grow warm and melt in God's love. Then will follow  praise and thanksgiving with a pure heart, from which the mass is  called in Greek Eucharistia, that is, \"thanksgiving,\" because we praise  and thank God for this comforting, rich, blessed testament, just as he  gives thanks, praises and is joyful, to whom a good friend has  presented a thousand and more gulden. Although Christ often fares like  those who make several persons rich by their testament, and these  persons never think of them, nor praise or thank them. So our masses at  present are merely celebrated, without our knowing why or wherefore,  and consequently we neither give thanks nor love nor praise, remain  parched and hard, and have enough with our little prayer. Of this more  another time.    III. The sermon ought to be nothing else than the proclamation of this  testament. But who can hear it if no one preaches it?  Now, they who  ought to preach it, themselves do not know it. This is why the sermons  ramble off into other unprofitable stories, and thus Christ is  forgotten, while we fare like the man in II.  Kings vii: we see our  riches but do not enjoy them. Of which the Preacher also says, \"This is  a great evil, when God giveth a man riches, and giveth him not power to  enjoy them.\" So we look on at unnumbered masses and do not know whether  the mass be a testament, or what it be, just as if it were any other  common good work by itself. O God, how exceeding blind we are! But  where this is rightly preached, it is necessary that it be diligently  heard, grasped, retained, often thought of, and that the faith be thus  strengthened against all the temptation of sin, whether past, or  present, or to come.    Lo! this is the only ceremony or practice which Christ has instituted,  in which His Christians shall assemble, exercise themselves and keep it  with one accord; and this He did not make to be a mere work like other  ceremonies, but placed into it a rich, exceeding great treasure, to be  offered and bestowed upon all who believe on it.    This preaching should induce sinners to grieve over their sins, and  should kindle in them a longing for the treasure. It must, therefore,  be a grievous sin not to hear the Gospel, and to despise such a  treasure and so rich a feast to which we are bidden; but a much greater  sin not to preach the Gospel, and to let so many people who would  gladly hear it perish, since Christ has so strictly commanded that the  Gospel and this testament be preached, that He does not wish even the  mass to be celebrated, unless the Gospel be preached, as He says: \"As  oft as ye do this, remember me\"; that is, as St. Paul says, \"Ye shall  preach of His death.\" For this reason it is dreadful and horrible in  our times to be a bishop, pastor and preacher; for no one any longer  knows this testament, to say nothing of their preaching it, although  this is their highest and only duty and obligation. How heavily must  they give account for so many souls who must perish because of this  lack in preaching.    IV. We should pray, not as the custom is, counting many pages or beads,  but fixing our mind upon some pressing need, desire it with all  earnestness, and exercise faith and confidence toward God in the  matter, in such wise that we do not doubt that we shall be heard. So  St. Bernard instructs his brethren and says: \"Dear brethren, you shall  by no means despise your prayer, as if it were in vain, for I tell you  of a truth that, before you have uttered the words, the prayer is  already recorded in heaven; and you shall confidently expect from God  one of two things: either that your prayer will be granted, or that, if  it will not be granted, the granting of it would not be good for you.\"    Prayer is, therefore, a special exercise of faith, and faith makes the  prayer so acceptable that either it will surely be granted, or  something better than we ask will be given in its stead. So also says  St. James: \"Let him who asketh of God not waver in faith; for if he  wavers, let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the  Lord.\" This is a clear statement, which says directly: he who does not  trust, receives nothing, neither that which he asks, nor anything  better.    And to call forth such faith, Christ Himself has said, Mark xi:  \"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,  believe that ye receive them, and ye shall surely have them.\" And Luke  xi: \"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,  and it shall be opened unto you; for every one that asketh receiveth;  and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be  opened. Or what father is there of you, who, if his son shall ask  bread, will he give him a stone?  or if he ask a fish, will he give him  a serpent? or if he ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion? But if you  know how to give good gifts to your children, and you yourselves are  not naturally good, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven  give a good spirit to all them that ask Him!\"    V. Who is so hard and stone-like, that such mighty words ought not to  move him to pray with all confidence! joyfully and gladly?  But how  many prayers must be reformed, if we are to pray aright according to  these words! Now, indeed, all churches and monastic houses are full of  praying and singing, but how does it happen that so little improvement  and benefit result from it, and things daily grow worse? The reason is  none other than that which St.  James indicates when he says: \"You ask  much and receive not, because ye ask amiss.\" For where this faith and  confidence is not in the prayer, the prayer is dead, and nothing more  than a grievous labor and work. If anything is given for it, it is none  the less only temporal benefit without any blessing and help for the  soul; nay, to the great injury and blinding of souls, so that they go  their way, babbling much with their mouths, regardless of whether they  receive, or desire, or trust; and in this unbelief, the state of mind  most opposed to the exercise of faith and to the nature of prayer, they  remain hardened.    From this it follows that one who prays aright never doubts that his  prayer is surely acceptable and heard, although the very thing for  which he prays be not given him. For we are to lay our need before God  in prayer, but not prescribe to Him a measure, manner, time or place;  but if He wills to give it to us better or in another way than we  think, we are to leave it to Him; for frequently we do not know what we  pray, as St. Paul says, Romans viii; and God works and gives above all  that we understand, as he says, Ephesians iii, so that there be no  doubt that the prayer is acceptable and heard, and we yet leave to God  the time, place, measure and limit; He will surely do what is right.  They are the true worshipers, who worship God in spirit and in truth.  For they who believe not that they will be heard, sin upon the left  hand against this Commandment, and go far astray with their unbelief.  But they who set a limit for Him, sin upon the other side, and come too  close with their tempting of God. So He has forbidden both, that we  should err from His Commandment neither to the left nor to the right,  that is, neither with unbelief nor with tempting, but with simple faith  remain on the straight road, trusting Him, and yet setting Him no  bounds.    VI. Thus we see that this Commandment, like the Second, is to be  nothing else than a doing and keeping of the First Commandment, that  is, of faith, trust, confidence, hope and love to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],[0,"The Magic of Oz (#11)"],[1,"Lion and the  little girl came another beast--a monstrous Tiger, who bore upon his  back a funny little man carrying a black bag.  Right past the rows of  wondering beasts the strange animals walked, advancing until they stood  just before the rock throne of Gugu.    Then the little girl and the funny little man dismounted, and the great  Lion demanded in a loud voice:    \"Who is King in this forest?\"    \"I am!\" answered Gugu, looking steadily at the other.  \"I am Gugu the  Leopard, and I am King of this forest.\"    \"Then I greet Your Majesty with great respect,\" said the Lion.  \"Perhaps you have heard of me, Gugu.  I am called the 'Cowardly Lion,'  and I am King of all Beasts, the world over.\"    Gugu's eyes flashed angrily.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"I have heard of you.  You have long claimed to be King  of Beasts, but no beast who is a coward can be King over me.\"    \"He isn't a coward, Your Majesty,\" asserted the little girl, \"He's just  cowardly, that's all.\"    Gugu looked at her.  All the other beasts were looking at her, too.    \"Who are you?\" asked the King.    \"Me?  Oh, I'm just Dorothy,\" she answered.    \"How dare you come here?\" demanded the King.    \"Why, I'm not afraid to go anywhere, if the Cowardly Lion is with me,\"  she said.  \"I know him pretty well, and so I can trust him.  He's  always afraid, when we get into trouble, and that's why he's cowardly;  but he's a terrible fighter, and that's why he isn't a coward.  He  doesn't like to fight, you know, but when he HAS to, there isn't any  beast living that can conquer him.\"    Gugu the King looked at the big, powerful form of the Cowardly Lion,  and knew she spoke the truth.  Also the other Lions of the forest now  came forward and bowed low before the strange Lion.    \"We welcome Your Majesty,\" said one.  \"We have known you many years  ago, before you went to live at the Emerald City, and we have seen you  fight the terrible Kalidahs and conquer them, so we know you are the  King of all Beasts.\"    \"It is true,\" replied the Cowardly Lion; \"but I did not come here to  rule the beasts of this forest.  Gugu is King here, and I believe he is  a good King and just and wise.  I come, with my friends, to be the  guest of Gugu, and I hope we are welcome.\"    That pleased the great Leopard, who said very quickly:    \"Yes; you, at least, are welcome to my forest.  But who are these  strangers with you?\"    \"Dorothy has introduced herself,\" replied the Lion, \"and you are sure  to like her when you know her better.  This man is the Wizard of Oz, a  friend of mine who can do wonderful tricks of magic.  And here is my  true and tried friend, the Hungry Tiger, who lives with me in the  Emerald City.\"    \"Is he ALWAYS hungry?\" asked Loo the Unicorn.    \"I am,\" replied the Tiger, answering the question himself.  \"I am  always hungry for fat babies.\"    \"Can't you find any fat babies in Oz to eat?\" inquired Loo, the Unicorn.    \"There are plenty of them, of course,\" said the Tiger, \"but  unfortunately I have such a tender conscience that it won't allow me to  eat babies.  So I'm always hungry for 'em and never can eat 'em,  because my conscience won't let me.\"    Now of all the surprised beasts in that clearing, not one was so much  surprised at the sudden appearance of these four strangers as Ruggedo  the Nome.  He was frightened, too, for he recognized them as his most  powerful enemies; but he also realized that they could not know he was  the former King of the Nomes, because of the beast's form he wore,  which disguised him so effectually.  So he took courage and resolved  that the Wizard and Dorothy should not defeat his plans.    It was hard to tell, just yet, what the vast assemblage of beasts  thought of the new arrivals.  Some glared angrily at them, but more of  them seemed to be curious and wondering.  All were interested, however,  and they kept very quiet and listened carefully to all that was said.    Kiki Aru, who had remained unnoticed in the shadow of the rock, was at  first more alarmed by the coming of the strangers than even Ruggedo  was, and the boy told himself that unless he acted quickly and without  waiting to ask the advice of the old Nome, their conspiracy was likely  to be discovered and all their plans to conquer and rule Oz be  defeated.  Kiki didn't like the way Ruggedo acted either, for the  former King of the Nomes wanted to do everything his own way, and made  the boy, who alone possessed the power of transformations, obey his  orders as if he were a slave.    Another thing that disturbed Kiki Aru was the fact that a real Wizard  had arrived, who was said to possess many magical powers, and this  Wizard carried his tools in a black bag, and was the friend of the Oz  people, and so would probably try to prevent war between the beasts of  the forest and the people of Oz.    All these things passed through the mind of the Hyup boy while the  Cowardly Lion and Gugu the King were talking together, and that was why  he now began to do several strange things.    He had found a place, near to the point where he stood, where there was  a deep hollow in the rock, so he put his face into this hollow and  whispered softly, so he would not be heard:    \"I want the Wizard of Oz to become a fox--Pyrzqxgl!\"    The Wizard, who had stood smilingly beside his friends, suddenly felt  his form change to that of a fox, and his black bag fell to the ground.  Kiki reached out an arm and seized the bag, and the Fox cried as loud  as it could:    \"Treason!  There's a traitor here with magic powers!\"    Everyone was startled at this cry, and Dorothy, seeing her old friend's  plight, screamed and exclaimed: \"Mercy me!\"    But the next instant the little girl's form had changed to that of a  lamb with fleecy white wool, and Dorothy was too bewildered to do  anything but look around her in wonder.    The Cowardly Lion's eyes now flashed fire; he crouched low and lashed  the ground with his tail and gazed around to discover who the  treacherous magician might be.  But Kiki, who had kept his face in the  hollow rock, again whispered the magic word, and the great lion  disappeared and in his place stood a little boy dressed in Munchkin  costume.  The little Munchkin boy was as angry as the lion had been,  but he was small and helpless.    Ruggedo the Nome saw what was happening and was afraid Kiki would spoil  all his plans, so he leaned over the rock and shouted: \"Stop,  Kiki--stop!\"    Kiki would not stop, however.  Instead, he transformed the Nome into a  goose, to Ruggedo's horror and dismay.  But the Hungry Tiger had  witnessed all these transformations, and he was watching to see which  of those present was to blame for them.  When Ruggedo spoke to Kiki,  the Hungry Tiger knew that he was the magician, so he made a sudden  spring and hurled his great body full upon the form of the Li-Mon-Eag  crouching against the rock.  Kiki didn't see the Tiger coming because  his face was still in the hollow, and the heavy body of the tiger bore  him to the earth just as he said \"Pyrzqxgl!\" for the fifth time.    So now the tiger which was crushing him changed to a rabbit, and  relieved of its weight, Kiki sprang up and, spreading his eagle's  wings, flew into the branches of a tree, where no beast could easily  reach him.  He was not an instant too quick in doing this, for Gugu the  King had crouched on the rock's edge and was about to spring on the boy.    From his tree Kiki transformed Gugu into a fat Gillikin woman, and  laughed aloud to see how the woman pranced with rage, and how  astonished all the beasts were at their King's new shape.    The beasts were frightened, too, fearing they would share the fate of  Gugu, so a stampede began when Rango the Gray Ape sprang into the  forest, and Bru the Bear and Loo the Unicorn followed as quickly as  they could.  The elephants backed into the forest, and all the other  animals, big and little, rushed after them, scattering through the  jungles until the clearing was far behind.  The monkeys scrambled into  the trees and swung themselves from limb to limb, to avoid being  trampled upon by the bigger beasts, and they were so quick that they  distanced all the rest.  A panic of fear seemed to have overtaken the  forest people and they got as far away from the terrible Magician as  they possibly could.    But the transformed ones stayed in the clearing, being so astonished  and bewildered by their new shapes that they could only look at one  another in a dazed and helpless fashion, although each one was greatly  annoyed at the trick that had been played on him.    \"Who are you?\" the Munchkin boy asked the Rabbit; and \"Who are you?\"  the Fox asked the Lamb; and \"Who are you?\" the Rabbit asked the fat  Gillikin woman.    \"I'm Dorothy,\" said the woolly Lamb.    \"I'm the Wizard,\" said the Fox.    \"I'm the Cowardly Lion,\" said the Munchkin boy.    \"I'm the Hungry Tiger,\" said the Rabbit.    \"I'm Gugu the King,\" said the fat Woman.    But when they asked the Goose who he was, Ruggedo the Nome would not  tell them.    \"I'm just a Goose,\" he replied, \"and what I was before, I cannot  remember.\"          13.  The Loss of the Black Bag      Kiki Aru, in the form of the Li-Mon-Eag, had scrambled into the high,  thick branches of the tree, so no one could see him, and there he  opened the Wizard's black bag, which he had carried away in his flight.  He was curious to see what the Wizard's magic tools looked like, and  hoped he could use some of them and so secure more power; but after he  had taken the articles, one by one, from the bag, he had to admit they  were puzzles to him.  For, unless he understood their uses, they were  of no value whatever.  Kiki Aru, the Hyup boy, was no wizard or  magician at all, and could do nothing unusual except to use the Magic  Word he had stolen from his father on Mount Munch.  So he hung the  Wizard's black bag on a branch of the tree and then climbed down to the  lower limbs that he might see what"]]]
