He should have been born in one of those Latin countries where  the women do all the work and the men play guitars, drink and make  love.\"    I drew a deep breath. I had won my first convert. I knew what Paul  of Tarsus felt when he met up with Timothy. I thought of Mahomet and  Fatima, Karl Marx and Bakunin, Hitler and Hess. Crazy though the whole  world would consider me, here was one human being who could listen to  my story without phoning for an ambulance.    \"Tell me about this Frank Jacklin,\" Arthurjean remarked. \"I don't get  all the angles about him and this Dorothy. Seems to me you--Winnie,  that is--told me he was the guy she'd had a sort of crush on at school.  Winnie was still sort of sore about it twenty years later.\"    \"It's hard for me to be fair,\" I admitted. \"Jacklin was a big shot at  school and may have had a swelled head. Winnie wasn't so hot then--nice  but with too much money. Jacklin's people were poor, by comparison that  is. He got through Yale, slid out into the newspaper game, held his  job, married a girl, had a bust-up with his wife and joined the Navy as  a reserve officer after she walked out on him. The Navy assigned him to  P.R.O. work and sent him to the Pacific.\"    \"He sounds like a heel,\" she observed, \"leaving his wife like that.  Tell me more about her. Is she pretty?\"    I thought a long time. \"I don't quite know,\" I said finally. \"I never  knew. She was necessary to me, long after I was necessary to her. She  had a mole on her left hip and a gruff way of talking when she was  really fond of me. I guess she got tired of living in Hartford and took  it out on me.\"    \"Any kids?\"    I shook my head vigorously. \"Cost too much on a newspaper salary. She  said she didn't want any until we could afford them. I was fool enough  to believe her. Then when we could afford them she didn't want them.  Can't say I blame her.\"    \"Did she make you happy?\"    \"Of course not! Who wants to be happy? She made me miserable, but  it was exciting to be around her. I never knew what I'd find when  I got home--a knockdown drag-out fight over nothing at all or  hearts-and-flowers equally over nothing.\"    Arthurjean yawned. \"That part's convincing,\" she agreed. \"I'll play  this one straight. You're Frank Jacklin _and_ Winnie Tompkins rolled  into one. The point is, where do we go from here? Let's see you sign  Jacklin's name.\"    I pulled out Winnie's gold, life-time fountain pen and wrote \"Frank E.  Jacklin\" over and over again on the back of an envelope. She studied it  carefully.    \"That's no phony,\" she agreed, \"and it's nothing like Winnie's  handwriting. Think I could get a check cashed on it?\"    \"Let's try,\" I suggested. \"Tomorrow when I get to the office I'll  pre-date a check on the Riggs Bank at Washington. You mail it in for  collection and we'll see if it clears.\"    She shook her head. \"No dice! If I tried that, first thing we know we'd  have the A.B.A. dicks after you for forgery. Can you think of anything  else?\"    \"Not unless you go to Washington and see Dorothy in O.S.S. and ask her  to verify my handwriting. Or, wait. You can go and talk to her and  notice whether she wriggles her nose to keep her spectacles up. You  can find out whether she's still nuts about Prokofiev. You can ask if  she still thinks that Ernest Hemingway is a worse writer than Charles  Dickens, and whether she still uses Chanel's Gardenia perfume.\"    \"That's enough,\" she interrupted. \"But how'm I going to get to  Washington and do all these things?\"    \"Next week,\" I said, \"you and I can fly down on a business  trip--war-contracts, cut-backs, something official--and while I'm being  whip-sawed by the desk-heroes you can check on Dorothy. See if I'm not  right.\"    She nodded. \"That's one way. What can we cook up? The office is tied up  in estate work and that leaves no chance for Uncle Sam. You get what he  leaves the heirs and they tell me that the inheritance tax is here to  stay.\"    I considered the problem. \"Tell you what, Arthurjean,\" I replied. \"I've  been thinking this over. The war's going to end this summer. What I saw  on the Alaska means that nobody can hold out against us. The Germans  are on their last legs, but most of the wise guys are saying that  it will take from eighteen months to two years to clean up Japan--a  million casualties, billions of dollars. This thorium bomb will do  the trick and the war will be over by Labor Day. There's a chance for  Winnie Tompkins to make another two or three millions.\"    She laughed sardonically. \"How?\"    \"There's uranium stocks,\" I suggested.    \"All sewed up by the insiders. Last year you--or Winnie--got a query on  uranium and found that there wasn't any to be had.\"    \"There's wheat and sugar,\" I argued. \"The world's going to be hungry.  There's a famine coming sure as hell. Buy futures and we'll be set.\"    \"Sure,\" she agreed, \"if you want to buy Black and can get funds into  Cuba or the Argentine. But there are inter-allied pools operating in  sugar and wheat and you can't break into the game without connections  at Washington.\"    \"How about peace-babies?\" I demanded. \"We can sell our war bonds and  invest in something solid for post-war reconstruction. Say General  Motors or U.S. Steel.\"    Arthurjean crossed the room and rumpled my head affectionately. \"Baby,\"  she observed, \"it's damn lucky for you and Winnie's dough I know my way  around the Street. Lay off heavy industrials until the labor business  gets straightened out. It's all set for a big strike-wave when the  shooting stops and a lot of investors are going to be burned. You can  sell short of course but you'll have to wait for that. If you must go  in for gambling, try the race-track or the slot-machines. Uncle Sam has  it fixed so that the only way you can make money out of the peace is  to be a Swiss or a Swede.\"    \"But that doesn't make sense,\" I objected. \"In any place and at any  time, advance knowledge on what is going to happen is worth a fortune.  How about selling some of the war industries short?\"    She shook her head. \"You wait till you've been to Washington. Some of  the smart guys down there may know the answers. Perhaps it will be  real-estate, if they can only get rid of rent-control. Probably it will  be surplus war-stocks but that's going to be a political racket. Anyhow  the tax-collector will be waiting for you, so why worry?\"    \"Speaking of cashing checks,\" I reminded her, \"how in hell am I going  to get some dough? How does Winnie sign himself at the City Farmers  anyhow?\"    She laughed. \"He has three or four separate accounts. The one he uses  for purely personal hell-raising is just signed 'W. S. Tompkins.' Let's  see you try to write that. Remember he loops all his letters and draws  a little circle instead of a dot over the 'i'.\"    I tried that a few times until she shook her head.    \"There isn't a bank-clerk in New York who wouldn't stop a check with  that on it. Let's see, he signed his name to something around here. See  if you can't copy it.\"    She fumbled under a pile of magazines and finally came up with a copy  of \"The Story of Philosophy\" by Will Durant.    \"Winnie thought this would be good for me,\" she explained. \"Here  it is: 'For Miss Arthurjean Briggs, with the compliments of W. S.  Tompkins.' He was like that--sort of formal--it gave him a kick. He  bought that for me second-hand after we'd been drinking Atlantic City  dry at an investment bankers convention. Try it.\"    I tried the signature again but the effort was even worse than my  free-hand efforts. This time it looked like what it was--a clumsy  forgery.    \"Hell,\" I exclaimed, \"I've simply got to do better than that. How about  my tracing it?\"    \"You'd be surprised,\" she told me, \"how easy it is to spot a signature  that's been traced. It's something about the flow of the ink and the  angle of the pen. No two signatures are exactly alike and that's why a  tracing gives itself away. They got machines which spot it.\"    \"Well, how'm I going to get some dough?\" I demanded. \"I can't draw on  Jacklin's Washington account--and the chances are there isn't much  there anyhow. And if I try to draw on Tompkins' account I'll find  myself in the hoosegow.\"    She got up and mixed us another pair of drinks. \"I got it,\" she  announced. \"It won't be too nice for you but it's better than starving.\"    \"You mean you'll lend me some?\"    \"Hell, baby, I got no money--twenty-five or thirty in the account and a  few hundreds in war-bonds. No, this is better. Just hold out your hand  and shut your eyes.\"    It sounded like jewels. I leaned back in the chair, closed my eyes and  extended my right hand in front of me, palm upward. I heard her pad  into the bathroom. When she came back, her voice sounded strained as  she whispered: \"This is it, baby. Keep those eyes shut!\"    There was a smooth, tingling sensation across the tips of my fingers,  then my right hand was suddenly warm and wet. I opened my eyes to see  Arthurjean holding a stained safety-razor blade in her hand and staring  at me, white-faced, as the blood trickled from my finger-tips.    \"Winnie--\" she faltered, and slumped down in the divan.    I hastily grabbed the handkerchief from my breast-pocket and wrapped it  around my throbbing fingers.    \"Ouch! Damn you!\" I exclaimed.    \"I'm sorry, baby,\" she whispered. \"I didn't want to hurt you. It seemed  the only way--\"    \"You damned fool,\" I almost shouted at her. \"Do you realize you flopped  with that blade in your hand and might have cut an artery?\"    \"No, did I?\" She scrambled up hastily and looked around. \"Gee, I feel  lousy. Does it hurt much?\"    \"Not yet. What's the big idea?\"    \"Now you sound like Winnie,\" she replied. \"He never got ideas easy.  Listen, you big slob, if you've cut your fingers you got to have a  bandage and if you got a bandage on your right hand, your signature's  going"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],[0,"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#11)"],[1," and sang as  merrily as ever, for he would allow no disappointment to sour his  temper or make him unhappy.    One bright morning he looked from his window and saw two of the deer he  had known in the Forest walking toward his house.    Claus was surprised; not that the friendly deer should visit him, but  that they walked on the surface of the snow as easily as if it were  solid ground, notwithstanding the fact that throughout the Valley the  snow lay many feet deep.  He had walked out of his house a day or two  before and had sunk to his armpits in a drift.    So when the deer came near he opened the door and called to them:    \"Good morning, Flossie!  Tell me how you are able to walk on the snow  so easily.\"    \"It is frozen hard,\" answered Flossie.    \"The Frost King has breathed on it,\" said Glossie, coming up, \"and the  surface is now as solid as ice.\"    \"Perhaps,\" remarked Claus, thoughtfully, \"I might now carry my pack of  toys to the children.\"    \"Is it a long journey?\" asked Flossie.    \"Yes; it will take me many days, for the pack is heavy,\" answered Claus.    \"Then the snow would melt before you could get back,\" said the deer.  \"You must wait until spring, Claus.\"    Claus sighed.  \"Had I your fleet feet,\" said he, \"I could make the  journey in a day.\"    \"But you have not,\" returned Glossie, looking at his own slender legs  with pride.    \"Perhaps I could ride upon your back,\" Claus ventured to remark, after  a pause.    \"Oh no; our backs are not strong enough to bear your weight,\" said  Flossie, decidedly.  \"But if you had a sledge, and could harness us to  it, we might draw you easily, and your pack as well.\"    \"I'll make a sledge!\" exclaimed Claus.  \"Will you agree to draw me if I  do?\"    \"Well,\" replied Flossie, \"we must first go and ask the Knooks, who are  our guardians, for permission; but if they consent, and you can make a  sledge and harness, we will gladly assist you.\"    \"Then go at once!\" cried Claus, eagerly.  \"I am sure the friendly  Knooks will give their consent, and by the time you are back I shall be  ready to harness you to my sledge.\"    Flossie and Glossie, being deer of much intelligence, had long wished  to see the great world, so they gladly ran over the frozen snow to ask  the Knooks if they might carry Claus on his journey.    Meantime the toy-maker hurriedly began the construction of a sledge,  using material from his wood-pile.  He made two long runners that  turned upward at the front ends, and across these nailed short boards,  to make a platform.  It was soon completed, but was as rude in  appearance as it is possible for a sledge to be.    The harness was more difficult to prepare, but Claus twisted strong  cords together and knotted them so they would fit around the necks of  the deer, in the shape of a collar.  From these ran other cords to  fasten the deer to the front of the sledge.    Before the work was completed Glossie and Flossie were back from the  Forest, having been granted permission by Will Knook to make the  journey with Claus provided they would to Burzee by daybreak the next  morning.    \"That is not a very long time,\" said Flossie; \"but we are swift and  strong, and if we get started by this evening we can travel many miles  during the night.\"    Claus decided to make the attempt, so he hurried on his preparations as  fast as possible.  After a time he fastened the collars around the  necks of his steeds and harnessed them to his rude sledge.  Then he  placed a stool on the little platform, to serve as a seat, and filled a  sack with his prettiest toys.    \"How do you intend to guide us?\" asked Glossie.  \"We have never been  out of the Forest before, except to visit your house, so we shall not  know the way.\"    Claus thought about that for a moment.  Then he brought more cords and  fastened two of them to the spreading antlers of each deer, one on the  right and the other on the left.    \"Those will be my reins,\" said Claus, \"and when I pull them to the  right or to the left you must go in that direction.  If I do not pull  the reins at all you may go straight ahead.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Glossie and Flossie; and then they asked: \"Are  you ready?\"    Claus seated himself upon the stool, placed the sack of toys at his  feet, and then gathered up the reins.    \"All ready!\" he shouted; \"away we go!\"    The deer leaned forward, lifted their slender limbs, and the next  moment away flew the sledge over the frozen snow.  The swiftness of the  motion surprised Claus, for in a few strides they were across the  Valley and gliding over the broad plain beyond.    The day had melted into evening by the time they started; for, swiftly  as Claus had worked, many hours had been consumed in making his  preparations.  But the moon shone brightly to light their way, and  Claus soon decided it was just as pleasant to travel by night as by day.    The deer liked it better; for, although they wished to see something of  the world, they were timid about meeting men, and now all the dwellers  in the towns and farmhouses were sound asleep and could not see them.    Away and away they sped, on and on over the hills and through the  valleys and across the plains until they reached a village where Claus  had never been before.    Here he called on them to stop, and they immediately obeyed.  But a new  difficulty now presented itself, for the people had locked their doors  when they went to bed, and Claus found he could not enter the houses to  leave his toys.    \"I am afraid, my friends, we have made our journey for nothing,\" said  he, \"for I shall be obliged to carry my playthings back home again  without giving them to the children of this village.\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Flossie.    \"The doors are locked,\" answered Claus, \"and I can not get in.\"    Glossie looked around at the houses.  The snow was quite deep in that  village, and just before them was a roof only a few feet above the  sledge.  A broad chimney, which seemed to Glossie big enough to admit  Claus, was at the peak of the roof.    \"Why don't you climb down that chimney?\" asked Glossie.    Claus looked at it.    \"That would be easy enough if I were on top of the roof,\" he answered.    \"Then hold fast and we will take you there,\" said the deer, and they  gave one bound to the roof and landed beside the big chimney.    \"Good!\" cried Claus, well pleased, and he slung the pack of toys over  his shoulder and got into the chimney.    There was plenty of soot on the bricks, but he did not mind that, and  by placing his hands and knees against the sides he crept downward  until he had reached the fireplace.  Leaping lightly over the  smoldering coals he found himself in a large sitting-room, where a dim  light was burning.    From this room two doorways led into smaller chambers.  In one a woman  lay asleep, with a baby beside her in a crib.    Claus laughed, but he did not laugh aloud for fear of waking the baby.  Then he slipped a big doll from his pack and laid it in the crib.  The  little one smiled, as if it dreamed of the pretty plaything it was to  find on the morrow, and Claus crept softly from the room and entered at  the other doorway.    Here were two boys, fast asleep with their arms around each other's  neck.  Claus gazed at them lovingly a moment and then placed upon the  bed a drum, two horns and a wooden elephant.    He did not linger, now that his work in this house was done, but  climbed the chimney again and seated himself on his sledge.    \"Can you find another chimney?\" he asked the reindeer.    \"Easily enough,\" replied Glossie and Flossie.    Down to the edge of the roof they raced, and then, without pausing,  leaped through the air to the top of the next building, where a huge,  old-fashioned chimney stood.    \"Don't be so long, this time,\" called Flossie, \"or we shall never get  back to the Forest by daybreak.\"    Claus made a trip down this chimney also and found five children  sleeping in the house, all of whom were quickly supplied with toys.    When he returned the deer sprang to the next roof, but on descending  the chimney Claus found no children there at all.  That was not often  the case in this village, however, so he lost less time than you might  suppose in visiting the dreary homes where there were no little ones.    When he had climbed down the chimneys of all the houses in that  village, and had left a toy for every sleeping child, Claus found that  his great sack was not yet half emptied.    \"Onward, friends!\" he called to the deer; \"we must seek another  village.\"    So away they dashed, although it was long past midnight, and in a  surprisingly short time they came to a large city, the largest Claus  had ever visited since he began to make toys.  But, nothing daunted by  the throng of houses, he set to work at once and his beautiful steeds  carried him rapidly from one roof to another, only the highest being  beyond the leaps of the agile deer.    At last the supply of toys was exhausted and Claus seated himself in  the sledge, with the empty sack at his feet, and turned the heads of  Glossie and Flossie toward home.    Presently Flossie asked:    \"What is that gray streak in the sky?\"    \"It is the coming dawn of day,\" answered Claus, surprised to find that  it was so late.    \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Glossie; \"then we shall not be home by  daybreak, and the Knooks will punish us and never let us come again.\"    \"We must race for the Laughing Valley and make our best speed,\"  returned Flossie; \"so hold fast, friend Claus!\"    Claus held fast and the next moment was flying so swiftly over the snow  that he could not see the trees as they whirled past.  Up hill and down  dale, swift as an arrow shot from a bow they dashed, and Claus shut his  eyes to keep the wind out of them and left the deer to find their own  way.    It seemed to him they were plunging through space, but he was not at  all afraid.  The Knooks were severe masters, and must be obeyed at all "]]]
