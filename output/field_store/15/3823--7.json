Imagine a child with a pin  pricking him, kicking, and screaming, and squirming with the pain,  so that his mother--try as carefully as she may--takes five minutes  to find the pin and get it out, when she might have done it and  relieved him in five seconds, if only the child had kept still and  let her.    So it is with us when Mother Nature is working with wise steadiness  to find the pin that is making us ill, and to get it out. We fret  and worry so that it takes her ten or twenty days to do the good  work that she might have done in three.    In order to drop the fretting, we must use our wills to think, and  feel, and act, so that the way may be opened for health to come to  us in the quickest possible time.    Every contraction of worry which appears in the muscles we must  drop, so that we lie still with a sense of resting, and waiting for  the healing power, which is surely working within us, to make us  well.    _We can do this by a deliberate use of our wills._    If we could take our choice between medicine, and the curative power  of dropping anxiety and letting ourselves get well, there would be  no hesitancy, provided we understood the alternatives.    I speak of fretting first because it is so often the strongest  interference with health.    Defective circulation is the trouble in most diseases, and we should  do all we can to open the channels so that the circulation, being  free elsewhere, can tend to open the way to greater freedom in the  part diseased. The contractions caused by fretting impede the  circulation still more, and therefore heighten the disease.    If once, by a strong use of the will, we drop the fretting and give  ourselves up entirely to letting nature cure us, then we can study,  with interest, to fulfill other necessary conditions. We can give  ourselves the right amount of fresh air, of nourishment, of bathing,  and the right sort of medicine, if any is needed.    Thus, instead of interfering with nature, we are doing all in our  power to aid her; and when nature and the invalid work in harmony,  health comes on apace.    When illness brings much pain and discomfort with it, the endeavor  to relax out of the contractions caused by the pain, are of the same  service as dropping contractions caused by the fretting.    If one can find a truly wise doctor, or nurse, in such an illness as  I refer to, get full instructions in just one visit, and then follow  those directions explicitly, only one visit will be needed,  probably, and the gain from that will pay for it many times over.    This article is addressed especially to those who are now in health.    It is perhaps too much to expect one in the midst of an illness to  start at once with what we may call the curative attitude, although  it could be done, but if those who are now well and strong will read  and get a good understanding of this healthy way of facing an  illness, and get it into their subconscious minds, they will find  that if at any time they should be unfortunate enough to be attacked  with illness, they can use the knowledge to very real advantage,  and--what is more--they can, with the right tact, help others to use  it also.    To see the common sense of a process and, when we have not the  opportunity to use the laws ourselves, to help others by means of  our knowledge, impresses our own brains more thoroughly with the  truth, especially if our advice is taken and acted upon and thus  proved to be true.    It must not be forgotten, however, that to help another man or woman  to a healthy process of getting well requires gentle patience and  quiet, steady, unremitting tact.          CHAPTER X    _Is Physical Culture good for Girls?_      A NUMBER of women were watching a game of basket-ball played by some  high-school girls. In the interim for rest one woman said to her  neighbor: \"Do you see that girl flat on her back, looking like a  very heavy bag of sand?\"    \"Yes,\" the answer was; \"what under the sun is she doing that for?  She looks heavy and lazy and logy, while the other girls are talking  and laughing and having a good time.\"    \"You wait and watch her play,\" responded the first woman. And so  they waited and watched, and to the astonishment of the friend the  girl who had looked \"lazy and logy,\" lying flat on her back during  the rest-time, was the most active of the players, and really saved  the game.    When the game was finished the woman said to her friend with  surprise in her voice: \"How did you see through that, and understand  what that girl was aiming for?\"    The answer was: \"Well, I know the girl, and both she and I have read  Kipling's 'The Maltese Cat.' Don't you remember how the best polo  ponies in that story, when they were off duty, hung their heads and  actually made themselves looked fagged, in order to be fresher when  the time came to play? And how 'The Maltese Cat' scouted the silly  ponies who held their heads up and kicked and looked alert while  they waited? And don't you remember the result?\"    \"No, I never read the story, but I have certainly seen your point  prove itself to-day. I shall read it at once. Meanwhile, I want to  speak to that clever girl who could catch a point like that and use  it.\"    \"Take care, please, that you do not mention it to her at all,\" said  the friend. \"You will draw her attention back to herself and likely  as not make her lose the next game. Points like that have got to be  worked on without self-consciousness, not talked about.\"    And so the women told the child they were glad that her side won the  game and never mentioned her own part in it at all. After all she  had only found the law that the more passive you can be when it is  time to rest, the more alert you are and the more powerful in  activity. The polo pony knew it as a matter of course. We humans  have to discover it.    Let us, just for the interest of it, follow that same basket-ball  player a little more closely. Was she well developed and evenly  trained in her muscles? Yes, very. Did she go to gymnasium, or did  she scorn it? She went, twice a week regularly, and had good fun  there; but there was just this contrast between her and most of the  girls in the class: Jane, as we will call her, went to gymnasium as  a means to an end. She found that she got an even development there  which enabled her to walk better, to play better, and to work  better. In gymnasium she laid her muscular foundation on which to  build all the good, active work of her life. The gymnasium she went  to, however, was managed in an unusual way except for the chest  weights, which always \"opened the ball,\" the members of the class  never knew what work they were to do. Their minds were kept alert  throughout the hour and a half. If their attention wavered they  tripped or got behind in the exercise, and the mental action which  went into the movement of every muscle made the body alive with the  healthy activity of a well-concentrated, well-directed mind.    Another point which our young friend learned at gymnasium was to  direct her mind only on to the muscles that were needed. Did you  ever try to clench your fist so tight that it could not be opened?  If not, try it, and relax all over your body while you are keeping  your fist tight closed. You will see that the more limp your body  becomes the tighter you can keep your fist clenched. All the force  goes in that one direction. In this way a moderately strong girl can  keep a strong man hard at work for several minutes before he can  make any impression on the closed hand. That illustrates in a simple  way the fact that the most wholesome concentration is that which  comes from dropping everything that interferes--letting the force of  mind or body flow only in the direction in which it is to be used.    Many girls use their brains in the wrong way while on the gymnasium  floor by saying to themselves, \"I cannot do that.\" The brain is so  full of that thought that the impression an open brain would receive  has no chance to enter, and the result is an awkward, nervous, and  uncertain movement. If a girl's brain and muscle were so relaxed  that the impression on the one would cause a correct use and  movement of the other how easy it would be thereafter to apply the  proper tension to the muscle at the proper time without overtaxing  the nerves.    Some one has well said that \"it is training, not straining, that we  want in our gymnasiums.\" Only when a girl is trained from this point  of view does she get real training.    This basket-ball player had also been taught how to rest after  exercise in a way which appealed to her especially, because of her  interest which had already been aroused in Kipling's polo pony. She  was taught intelligently that if, after vigorous exercise, when the  blood is coursing rapidly all over the body, you allow yourself to  be entirely open and passive, the blood finds no interruptions in  its work and can carry away the waste matter much more effectually.  In that way you get the full result of the exercise. It is not  necessary always to lie down to have your body passive enough after  vigorous exercise to get the best results. If you sit down after  exercise you want to sit without tension. Or if you walk home from  gymnasium you want to walk loosely and freely, keeping your chest up  and a little in advance, and pushing with the ball of your back foot  with a good, rhythmic balance. As this is the best way to sit and  the best way to walk--gymnasium or no gymnasium--to look out for a  well-balanced sitting and a well-balanced walk directly after  vigorous exercise, keeps us in good form for sitting and walking all  the time.    I know of a professor in one of our large colleges who was offered  also a professorship in a woman's college, and he refused to accept  because he said women's minds did not react. When he lectured to  girls he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4341"],[0,"Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (#11)"],[1,"the same food, as like cases are too often explained, but most probably  because the passionate, eminently-individualist hare cannot make friends  with that placid, quiet, and submissive creature, the rabbit. Their  tempers are too widely different not to be an obstacle to friendship.    Life in societies is again the rule with the large family of horses,  which includes the wild horses and donkeys of Asia, the zebras, the  mustangs, the cimarrones of the Pampas, and the half-wild horses of  Mongolia and Siberia. They all live in numerous associations made up of  many studs, each of which consists of a number of mares under the  leadership of a male. These numberless inhabitants of the Old and the  New World, badly organized on the whole for resisting both their  numerous enemies and the adverse conditions of climate, would soon have  disappeared from the surface of the earth were it not for their sociable  spirit. When a beast of prey approaches them, several studs unite at  once; they repulse the beast and sometimes chase it: and neither the  wolf nor the bear, not even the lion, can capture a horse or even a  zebra as long as they are not detached from the herd. When a drought is  burning the grass in the prairies, they gather in herds of sometimes  10,000 individuals strong, and migrate. And when a snow-storm rages in  the Steppes, each stud keeps close together, and repairs to a protected  ravine. But if confidence disappears, or the group has been seized by  panic, and disperses, the horses perish and the survivors are found  after the storm half dying from fatigue. Union is their chief arm in the  struggle for life, and man is their chief enemy. Before his increasing  numbers the ancestors of our domestic horse (the Equus Przewalskii, so  named by Polyakoff) have preferred to retire to the wildest and least  accessible plateaus on the outskirts of Thibet, where they continue to  live, surrounded by carnivores, under a climate as bad as that of the  Arctic regions, but in a region inaccessible to man.(18)    Many striking illustrations of social life could be taken from the life  of the reindeer, and especially of that large division of ruminants  which might include the roebucks, the fallow deer, the antelopes, the  gazelles, the ibex, and, in fact, the whole of the three numerous  families of the Antelopides, the Caprides, and the Ovides. Their  watchfulness over the safety of their herds against attacks of  carnivores; the anxiety displayed by all individuals in a herd of  chamois as long as all of them have not cleared a difficult passage over  rocky cliffs, the adoption of orphans; the despair of the gazelle whose  mate, or even comrade of the same sex, has been killed; the plays of the  youngsters, and many other features, could be mentioned. But perhaps the  most striking illustration of mutual support is given by the occasional  migrations of fallow deer, such as I saw once on the Amur. When I  crossed the high plateau and its border ridge, the Great Khingan, on my  way from Transbaikalia to Merghen, and further travelled over the high  prairies on my way to the Amur, I could ascertain how thinly-peopled  with fallow deer these mostly uninhabited regions are.(19) Two years  later I was travelling up the Amur, and by the end of October reached  the lower end of that picturesque gorge which the Amur pierces in the  Dousse-alin (Little Khingan) before it enters the lowlands where it  joins the Sungari. I found the Cossacks in the villages of that gorge in  the greatest excitement, because thousands and thousands of fallow deer  were crossing the Amur where it is narrowest, in order to reach the  lowlands. For several days in succession, upon a length of some forty  miles up the river, the Cossacks were butchering the deer as they  crossed the Amur, in which already floated a good deal of ice. Thousands  were killed every day, and the exodus nevertheless continued. Like  migrations were never seen either before or since, and this one must  have been called for by an early and heavy snow-fall in the Great  Khingan, which compelled the deer to make a desperate attempt at  reaching the lowlands in the east of the Dousse mountains. Indeed, a few  days later the Dousse-alin was also buried under snow two or three feet  deep. Now, when one imagines the immense territory (almost as big as  Great Britain) from which the scattered groups of deer must have  gathered for a migration which was undertaken under the pressure of  exceptional circumstances, and realizes the difficulties which had to be  overcome before all the deer came to the common idea of crossing the  Amur further south, where it is narrowest, one cannot but deeply admire  the amount of sociability displayed by these intelligent animals. The  fact is not the less striking if we remember that the buffaloes of North  America displayed the same powers of combination. One saw them grazing  in great numbers in the plains, but these numbers were made up by an  infinity of small groups which never mixed together. And yet, when  necessity arose, all groups, however scattered over an immense  territory, came together and made up those immense columns, numbering  hundreds of thousands of individuals, which I mentioned on a preceding  page.    I also ought to say a few words at least about the \"compound families\"  of the elephants, their mutual attachment, their deliberate ways in  posting sentries, and the feelings of sympathy developed by such a life  of close mutual support.(20) I might mention the sociable feelings of  those disreputable creatures the wild boars, and find a word of praise  for their powers of association in the case of an attack by a beast of  prey.(21) The hippopotamus and the rhinoceros, too, would occupy a place  in a work devoted to animal sociability. Several striking pages might be  given to the sociability and mutual attachment of the seals and the  walruses; and finally, one might mention the most excellent feelings  existing among the sociable cetaceans. But I have to say yet a few words  about the societies of monkeys, which acquire an additional interest  from their being the link which will bring us to the societies of  primitive men.    It is hardly needful to say that those mammals, which stand at the very  top of the animal world and most approach man by their structure and  intelligence, are eminently sociable. Evidently we must be prepared to  meet with all varieties of character and habits in so great a division  of the animal kingdom which includes hundreds of species. But, all  things considered, it must be said that sociability, action in common,  mutual protection, and a high development of those feelings which are  the necessary outcome of social life, are characteristic of most monkeys  and apes. From the smallest species to the biggest ones, sociability is  a rule to which we know but a few exceptions. The nocturnal apes prefer  isolated life; the capuchins (Cebus capucinus), the monos, and the  howling monkeys live but in small families; and the orang-outans have  never been seen by A.R. Wallace otherwise than either solitary or in  very small groups of three or four individuals, while the gorillas seem  never to join in bands. But all the remainder of the monkey tribe--the  chimpanzees, the sajous, the sakis, the mandrills, the baboons, and so  on--are sociable in the highest degree. They live in great bands, and  even join with other species than their own. Most of them become quite  unhappy when solitary. The cries of distress of each one of the band  immediately bring together the whole of the band, and they boldly  repulse the attacks of most carnivores and birds of prey. Even eagles do  not dare attack them. They plunder our fields always in bands--the old  ones taking care for the safety of the commonwealth. The little  tee-tees, whose childish sweet faces so much struck Humboldt, embrace  and protect one another when it rains, rolling their tails over the  necks of their shivering comrades. Several species display the greatest  solicitude for their wounded, and do not abandon a wounded comrade  during a retreat till they have ascertained that it is dead and that  they are helpless to restore it to life. Thus James Forbes narrated in  his Oriental Memoirs a fact of such resistance in reclaiming from his  hunting party the dead body of a female monkey that one fully  understands why \"the witnesses of this extraordinary scene resolved  never again to fire at one of the monkey race.\"(22) In some species  several individuals will combine to overturn a stone in order to search  for ants' eggs under it. The hamadryas not only post sentries, but have  been seen making a chain for the transmission of the spoil to a safe  place; and their courage is well known. Brehm's description of the  regular fight which his caravan had to sustain before the hamadryas  would let it resume its journey in the valley of the Mensa, in  Abyssinia, has become classical.(23) The playfulness of the tailed apes  and the mutual attachment which reigns in the families of chimpanzees  also are familiar to the general reader. And if we find among the  highest apes two species, the orang-outan and the gorilla, which are not  sociable, we must remember that both--limited as they are to very small  areas, the one in the heart of Africa, and the other in the two islands  of Borneo and Sumatra have all the appearance of being the last remnants  of formerly much more numerous species. The gorilla at least seems to  have been sociable in olden times, if the apes mentioned in the Periplus  really were gorillas.      We thus see, even from the above brief review, that life in societies is  no exception in the animal world; it is the rule, the law of Nature, and  it reaches its fullest development with the higher vertebrates. Those  species which live solitary, or in small families only, are relatively  few, and their numbers are limited."]]]
