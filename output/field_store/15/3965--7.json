Yesterday I saw bluebirds and a butterfly;  so this whiter of a fortnight is over. I fancy there is a trifle less  coughing in the camp. We hear of other stations in the Department where  the mortality, chiefly from yellow fever, has been frightful. Dr.  ---- is rubbing his hands professionally over the fearful tales of the  surgeon of a New York regiment, just from Key West, who has had two  hundred cases of the fever. \"I suppose he is a skilful, highly educated  man,\" said I. \"Yes,\" he responded with enthusiasm. \"Why, he had seventy  deaths!\"--as if that proved his superiority past question.      January 19.    \"And first, sitting proud as a lung on his throne, At the head of them  all rode Sir Richard Tyrone.\"    But I fancy that Sir Richard felt not much better satisfied with his  following than I to-day. J. R. L. said once that nothing was quite  so good as turtle-soup, except mock-turtle; and I have heard officers  declare that nothing was so stirring as real war, except some exciting  parade. To-day, for the first time, I marched the whole regiment through  Beaufort and back,--the first appearance of such a novelty on any  stage. They did march splendidly; this all admit. M----'s prediction  was fulfilled: \"Will not ---- be in bliss? A thousand men, every one  as black as a coal!\" I confess it. To look back on twenty broad  double-ranks of men (for they marched by platoons),--every polished  musket having a black face beside it, and every face set steadily to the  front,--a regiment of freed slaves marching on into the future,--it was  something to remember; and when they returned through the same streets,  marching by the flank, with guns at a \"support,\" and each man covering  his file-leader handsomely, the effect on the eye was almost as fine.  The band of the Eighth Maine joined us at the entrance of the town,  and escorted us in. Sergeant Rivers said ecstatically afterwards, in  describing the affair, \"And when dat band wheel in before us, and march  on,--my God! I quit dis world altogeder.\" I wonder if he pictured to  himself the many dusky regiments, now unformed, which I seemed to see  marching up behind us, gathering shape out of the dim air.    I had cautioned the men, before leaving camp, not to be staring about  them as they marched, but to look straight to the front, every man;  and they did it with their accustomed fidelity, aided by the sort of  spontaneous eye-for-effect which is in all their melodramatic natures.  One of them was heard to say exultingly afterwards, \"We didn't look to  de right nor to de leff. I didn't see notin' in Beaufort. Eb'ry step was  worth a half a dollar.\" And they all marched as if it were so. They knew  well that they were marching through throngs of officers and soldiers  who had drilled as many months as we had drilled weeks, and whose eyes  would readily spy out every defect. And I must say, that, on the whole,  with a few trivial exceptions, those spectators behaved in a manly  and courteous manner, and I do not care to write down all the handsome  things that were said. Whether said or not, they were deserved; and  there is no danger that our men will not take sufficient satisfaction in  their good appearance. I was especially amused at one of our recruits,  who did not march in the ranks, and who said, after watching the  astonishment of some white soldiers, \"De buckra sojers look like a man  who been-a-steal a sheep,\"--that is, I suppose, sheepish.    After passing and repassing through the town, we marched to the  parade-ground, and went through an hour's drill, forming squares and  reducing them, and doing other things which look hard on paper, and are  perfectly easy in fact; and we were to have been reviewed by General  Saxton, but he had been unexpectedly called to Ladies Island, and did  not see us at all, which was the only thing to mar the men's enjoyment.  Then we marched back to camp (three miles), the men singing the \"John  Brown Song,\" and all manner of things,--as happy creatures as one can  well conceive.    It is worth mentioning, before I close, that we have just received an  article about \"Negro Troops,\" from the _London Spectator_, which is so  admirably true to our experience that it seems as if written by one of  us. I am confident that there never has been, in any American newspaper,  a treatment of the subject so discriminating and so wise.      January 21.    To-day brought a visit from Major-General Hunter and his staff, by  General Saxton's invitation,--the former having just arrived in the  Department. I expected them at dress-parade, but they came during  battalion drill, rather to my dismay, and we were caught in our old  clothes. It was our first review, and I dare say we did tolerably;  but of course it seemed to me that the men never appeared so ill  before,--just as one always thinks a party at one's own house a failure,  even if the guests seem to enjoy it, because one is so keenly sensitive  to every little thing that goes wrong. After review and drill, General  Hunter made the men a little speech, at my request, and told them that  he wished there were fifty thousand of them. General Saxton spoke to  them afterwards, and said that fifty thousand muskets were on their way  for colored troops. The men cheered both the generals lustily; and they  were complimentary afterwards, though I knew that the regiment could not  have appeared nearly so well as on its visit to Beaufort. I suppose I  felt like some anxious mamma whose children have accidentally appeared  at dancing-school in their old clothes.    General Hunter promises us all we want,--pay when the funds arrive,  Springfield rifled muskets, and blue trousers. Moreover, he has  graciously consented that we should go on an expedition along the coast,  to pick up cotton, lumber, and, above all, recruits. I declined an offer  like this just after my arrival, because the regiment was not drilled or  disciplined, not even the officers; but it is all we wish for now.      \"What care I how black I be?    Forty pounds will marry me,\"    quoth Mother Goose. _Forty rounds_ will marry us to the American Army,  past divorcing, if we can only use them well. Our success or failure may  make or mar the prospects of colored troops. But it is well to remember  in advance that military success is really less satisfactory than any  other, because it may depend on a moment's turn of events, and that  may be determined by some trivial thing, neither to be anticipated nor  controlled. Napoleon ought to have won at Waterloo by all reasonable  calculations; but who cares? All that one can expect is, to do one's  best, and to take with equanimity the fortune of war.          Chapter 3. Up the St. Mary's      If Sergeant Rivers was a natural king among my dusky soldiers, Corporal  Robert Sutton was the natural prime-minister. If not in all respects the  ablest, he was the wisest man in our ranks. As large, as powerful, and  as black as our good-looking Color-Sergeant, but more heavily built and  with less personal beauty, he had a more massive brain and a far more  meditative and systematic intellect. Not yet grounded even in the  spelling-book, his modes of thought were nevertheless strong, lucid, and  accurate; and he yearned and pined for intellectual companionship beyond  all ignorant men whom I have ever met. I believe that he would have  talked all day and all night, for days together, to any officer  who could instruct him, until his companions, at least, fell asleep  exhausted. His comprehension of the whole problem of Slavery was more  thorough and far-reaching than that of any Abolitionist, so far as its  social and military aspects went; in that direction I could teach him  nothing, and he taught me much. But it was his methods of thought which  always impressed me chiefly: superficial brilliancy he left to others,  and grasped at the solid truth.    Of course his interest in the war and in the regiment was unbounded; he  did not take to drill with especial readiness, but he was insatiable  of it, and grudged every moment of relaxation. Indeed, he never had  any such moments; his mind was at work all the time, even when he was  singing hymns, of which he had endless store. He was not, however, one  of our leading religionists, but his moral code was solid and reliable,  like his mental processes. Ignorant as he was, the \"years that bring the  philosophic mind\" had yet been his, and most of my young officers seemed  boys beside him. He was a Florida man, and had been chiefly employed in  lumbering and piloting on the St. Mary's River, which divides Florida  from Georgia. Down this stream he had escaped in a \"dug-out,\" and after  thus finding the way, had returned (as had not a few of my men in other  cases) to bring away wife and child. \"I wouldn't have left my child,  Cunnel,\" he said, with an emphasis that sounded the depths of his strong  nature. And up this same river he was always imploring to be allowed to  guide an expedition.    Many other men had rival propositions to urge, for they gained  self-confidence from drill and guard-duty, and were growing impatient of  inaction. \"Ought to go to work, Sa,--don't believe in we lyin' in camp  eatin' up de perwisions.\" Such were the quaint complaints, which I heard  with joy. Looking over my note-books of that period, I find them filled  with topographical memoranda, jotted down by a flickering candle, from  the evening talk of the men,--notes of vulnerable points along  the coast, charts of rivers, locations of pickets. I prized these  conversations not more for what I thus learned of the country than for  what I learned of the men. One could thus measure their various degrees  of accuracy and their average military instinct; and I must say that in  every respect, save the accurate estimate of distances, they stood the  test well. But no project took my fancy so much,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/677"],[0,"The Heroes; Or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children (#11)"],[1," And Jason fell upon his knees, and hid his face between his hands.    And she spoke, 'I am the Queen of Olympus, Hera the wife of Zeus.  As  thou hast done to me, so will I do to thee.  Call on me in the hour of  need, and try if the Immortals can forget.'                            [Picture: Jason and Hera]    And when Jason looked up, she rose from off the earth, like a pillar of  tall white cloud, and floated away across the mountain peaks, toward  Olympus the holy hill.    Then a great fear fell on Jason: but after a while he grew light of  heart; and he blessed old Cheiron, and said, 'Surely the Centaur is a  prophet, and guessed what would come to pass, when he bade me speak  harshly to no soul whom I might meet.'    Then he went down toward Iolcos; and as he walked he found that he had  lost one of his sandals in the flood.    And as he went through the streets, the people came out to look at him,  so tall and fair was he; but some of the elders whispered together; and  at last one of them stopped Jason, and called to him, 'Fair lad, who are  you, and whence come you; and what is your errand in the town?'    'My name, good father, is Jason, and I come from Pelion up above; and my  errand is to Pelias your king; tell me then where his palace is.'    But the old man started, and grew pale, and said, 'Do you not know the  oracle, my son, that you go so boldly through the town with but one  sandal on?'    'I am a stranger here, and know of no oracle; but what of my one sandal?  I lost the other in Anauros, while I was struggling with the flood.'    Then the old man looked back to his companions; and one sighed, and  another smiled; at last he said, 'I will tell you, lest you rush upon  your ruin unawares.  The oracle in Delphi has said that a man wearing one  sandal should take the kingdom from Pelias, and keep it for himself.  Therefore beware how you go up to his palace, for he is the fiercest and  most cunning of all kings.'    Then Jason laughed a great laugh, like a war-horse in his pride.  'Good  news, good father, both for you and me.  For that very end I came into  the town.'    Then he strode on toward the palace of Pelias, while all the people  wondered at his bearing.    And he stood in the doorway and cried, 'Come out, come out, Pelias the  valiant, and fight for your kingdom like a man.'    Pelias came out wondering, and 'Who are you, bold youth?' he cried.    'I am Jason, the son of AEson, the heir of all this land.'    Then Pelias lifted up his hands and eyes, and wept, or seemed to weep;  and blessed the heavens which had brought his nephew to him, never to  leave him more.  'For,' said he, 'I have but three daughters, and no son  to be my heir.  You shall be my heir then, and rule the kingdom after me,  and marry whichsoever of my daughters you shall choose; though a sad  kingdom you will find it, and whosoever rules it a miserable man.  But  come in, come in, and feast.'    So he drew Jason in, whether he would or not, and spoke to him so  lovingly and feasted him so well, that Jason's anger passed; and after  supper his three cousins came into the hall, and Jason thought that he  should like well enough to have one of them for his wife.    But at last he said to Pelias, 'Why do you look so sad, my uncle?  And  what did you mean just now when you said that this was a doleful kingdom,  and its ruler a miserable man?'    Then Pelias sighed heavily again and again and again, like a man who had  to tell some dreadful story, and was afraid to begin; but at last--    'For seven long years and more have I never known a quiet night; and no  more will he who comes after me, till the golden fleece be brought home.'    Then he told Jason the story of Phrixus, and of the golden fleece; and  told him, too, which was a lie, that Phrixus' spirit tormented him,  calling to him day and night.  And his daughters came, and told the same  tale (for their father had taught them their parts), and wept, and said,  'Oh who will bring home the golden fleece, that our uncle's spirit may  rest; and that we may have rest also, whom he never lets sleep in peace?'    Jason sat awhile, sad and silent; for he had often heard of that golden  fleece; but he looked on it as a thing hopeless and impossible for any  mortal man to win it.    But when Pelias saw him silent, he began to talk of other things, and  courted Jason more and more, speaking to him as if he was certain to be  his heir, and asking his advice about the kingdom; till Jason, who was  young and simple, could not help saying to himself, 'Surely he is not the  dark man whom people call him.  Yet why did he drive my father out?'  And  he asked Pelias boldly, 'Men say that you are terrible, and a man of  blood; but I find you a kind and hospitable man; and as you are to me, so  will I be to you.  Yet why did you drive my father out?'    Pelias smiled, and sighed.  'Men have slandered me in that, as in all  things.  Your father was growing old and weary, and he gave the kingdom  up to me of his own will.  You shall see him to-morrow, and ask him; and  he will tell you the same.'    Jason's heart leapt in him when he heard that he was to see his father;  and he believed all that Pelias said, forgetting that his father might  not dare to tell the truth.    'One thing more there is,' said Pelias, 'on which I need your advice;  for, though you are young, I see in you a wisdom beyond your years.  There is one neighbour of mine, whom I dread more than all men on earth.  I am stronger than he now, and can command him; but I know that if he  stay among us, he will work my ruin in the end.  Can you give me a plan,  Jason, by which I can rid myself of that man?'    After awhile Jason answered, half laughing, 'Were I you, I would send him  to fetch that same golden fleece; for if he once set forth after it you  would never be troubled with him more.'    And at that a bitter smile came across Pelias' lips, and a flash of  wicked joy into his eyes; and Jason saw it, and started; and over his  mind came the warning of the old man, and his own one sandal, and the  oracle, and he saw that he was taken in a trap.    But Pelias only answered gently, 'My son, he shall be sent forthwith.'    'You mean me?' cried Jason, starting up, 'because I came here with one  sandal?'  And he lifted his fist angrily, while Pelias stood up to him  like a wolf at bay; and whether of the two was the stronger and the  fiercer it would be hard to tell.    But after a moment Pelias spoke gently, 'Why then so rash, my son?  You,  and not I, have said what is said; why blame me for what I have not done?  Had you bid me love the man of whom I spoke, and make him my son-in-law  and heir, I would have obeyed you; and what if I obey you now, and send  the man to win himself immortal fame?  I have not harmed you, or him.  One thing at least I know, that he will go, and that gladly; for he has a  hero's heart within him, loving glory, and scorning to break the word  which he has given.'    Jason saw that he was entrapped; but his second promise to Cheiron came  into his mind, and he thought, 'What if the Centaur were a prophet in  that also, and meant that I should win the fleece!'  Then he cried  aloud--    'You have well spoken, cunning uncle of mine!  I love glory, and I dare  keep to my word.  I will go and fetch this golden fleece.  Promise me but  this in return, and keep your word as I keep mine.  Treat my father  lovingly while I am gone, for the sake of the all-seeing Zeus; and give  me up the kingdom for my own on the day that I bring back the golden  fleece.'    Then Pelias looked at him and almost loved him, in the midst of all his  hate; and said, 'I promise, and I will perform.  It will be no shame to  give up my kingdom to the man who wins that fleece.'  Then they swore a  great oath between them; and afterwards both went in, and lay down to  sleep.    But Jason could not sleep for thinking of his mighty oath, and how he was  to fulfil it, all alone, and without wealth or friends.  So he tossed a  long time upon his bed, and thought of this plan and of that; and  sometimes Phrixus seemed to call him, in a thin voice, faint and low, as  if it came from far across the sea, 'Let me come home to my fathers and  have rest.'  And sometimes he seemed to see the eyes of Hera, and to hear  her words again--'Call on me in the hour of need, and see if the  Immortals can forget.'    And on the morrow he went to Pelias, and said, 'Give me a victim, that I  may sacrifice to Hera.'  So he went up, and offered his sacrifice; and as  he stood by the altar Hera sent a thought into his mind; and he went back  to Pelias, and said--    'If you are indeed in earnest, give me two heralds, that they may go  round to all the princes of the Minuai, who were pupils of the Centaur  with me, that we may fit out a ship together, and take what shall  befall.'    At that Pelias praised his wisdom, and hastened to send the heralds out;  for he said in his heart, 'Let all the princes go with him, and, like  him, never return; for so I shall be lord of all the Minuai, and the  greatest king in Hellas.'        PART III  HOW THEY BUILT THE SHIP 'ARGO' IN IOLCOS      So the heralds went out, and cried to all the heroes of the Minuai, 'Who  dare come to the adventure of the golden fleece?'    And Hera stirred the hearts of all the princes, and they came from all  their valleys to the yellow sands of Pagasai.  And first came Heracles  the mighty, with his lion's skin and club, and behind him Hylas his young  squire, who bore his arrows and his bow; and Tiphys, the skilful  steersman; and Butes, the fairest of all men; and Castor and Polydeuces  the twins, the sons of the magic swan; and Caeneus, the strongest of  mortals, whom the Centaurs tried in vain to kill, and overwhelmed him  with trunks of pine-trees, but even so he would not die; and thither came  Zetes and Calais, the winged sons of the north wind; and Peleus, the  father "]]]
