And the Indians have long histories of him and of King Alexander.  This kingdom has many cities and towns in the interior of the  country, as well as ports along the sea; and very much shipping. It  has many merchants and shipowners, both Moors and Gentiles.    The king, and the men-at-arms, and nobles of the country were all  Gentiles formerly, and now they are Moors, since the Moors conquered  the country in war, and hold the Gentiles subject to them, and  molest them and treat them ill. There are three qualities of these  Gentiles, that is to say, some are called Razbutes, and they, in the  time that their king was a Gentile, were knights, the defenders of  the kingdom, and governors of the country; they used to carry on  war, and even now there remain some towns of them in the mountains,  which have never chosen to pay obedience to the Moors, but, on the  contrary, make war upon them; and the King of Cambaya is not  sufficiently powerful to destroy them or subject them. They are very  good knights and great archers, and they have many other kinds of  arms with which they defend themselves from the Moors, without  owning any king or lord to govern them. The others are called  Banians, and are merchants and traders. These live amongst the  Moors, and trade with them in their goods. They are men who do not  eat meat nor fish, nor anything that has life; neither do they kill  anything, nor like to see it killed, because their idolatry forbids  it them; and they observe this to such an extreme that it is  something marvellous. For it often happens that the Moors bring them  some worms or little birds alive, saying they intend to kill them in  their presence; and they ransom them, and buy them to set them  flying, and save their lives for more money than they are worth. And  in the same way, if the governor of the country has got a man to be  executed, these Banians unite together and buy him from the officers  of justice, that he may not die; and frequently they sell him to  them. And in the same manner the Moors who beg for alms, when they  want alms from these people, take great stones and strike themselves  with them on the shoulders and the breast, and on their stomachs, as  if they were going to kill themselves with them, and they receive  alms not to do it, and to go away in peace. And others bring knives  and stab themselves in the arms and legs before them, in order to  extract alms; and others come to their doors to decapitate rats and  snakes and other reptiles, and they give them money not to do it, so  that they are very ill-treated by the Moors. If these people meet  with a band of ants in the road, they hasten out of the road, and go  and look for a place to pass without treading upon them. They  likewise sup in the daytime because they do not light candles at  night, in order that the mosquitoes and other insects may not come  and die in the flame; and if of necessity they must have a candle,  they keep them in lanterns of paper, or of stuff dipped in gum, so  that no living thing can get there to suffer. If these people have  lice they do not kill them, and if they worry them very much, they  send to fetch some men whom they have amongst them, also Gentiles,  whom they esteem of holy lives, like hermits, and who live in much  abstinence for the love of their idols, and these people pick out  their insects, and all those that they extract they put in their own  heads, and they nourish them on themselves and on their flesh for  the service of their idols. And so this law of not killing anything  is held in great observance. On the other hand, they are great  usurers and falsifiers of weights and measures, and merchandise, and  coin; and liars and cheats. These Gentiles are brown people, well  built and of good proportions, smart in their dress, and delicate  and temperate in their food. Their victuals are milk, butter, sugar,  rice, preserves of many kinds, many fruits, bread, vegetables, and  field herbs; they all have gardens and orchards wherever they live,  and many pools of water where they bathe twice every day, both men  and women; and having ended their washing, they hold the belief that  they are pardoned for all the sins which they have committed up to  that time. They wear the hair very long like the women in Spain, and  they wear it gathered on the top of the head, and made into a band  which is much adorned, and upon this a cap to fasten it; and they  always wear many flowers stuck into their hair, and sweet smelling  things. They also anoint themselves with white sandal mixed with  saffron and other scents; they are much given to fall in love. They  go bare, only covering themselves from the waist downwards with very  rich silk stuffs; they wear embroidered shoes of very good leather,  well worked, and some short silk skirts, and other short ones of  cotton, with which they cover their bodies. They do not carry arms,  only some small knives garnished with gold and silver, for two  reasons: one because they are persons who make little use of arms,  the other because the Moors forbid it to them. They use many  ear-rings of gold and jewellery in the ears, and many rings, and  belts of gold and jewellery upon the cloths with which they gird  themselves. The women of these Gentiles have very pretty, delicate  faces, and well made bodies, a little dark. Their dress is silk  stuff like their husbands' as far as the feet, and jackets[125] with  narrow sleeves of silk stuff, open at the shoulders, and other silk  cloths with which they cover themselves in the manner of morisco  almalafas; their heads bare, the hair gathered up upon the head;  they wear thick ankle rings of gold and silver on the legs, and  rings on their toes, and large coral beads on their arms, with beads  of gold filigree, and gold and silver bracelets; and round their  necks, necklaces of gold and jewellery, fitting closely; they have  large holes pierced in their ears, and in them rings of gold or  silver large enough for an egg to pass through them. They are modest  women, and when they go out of their houses they are much covered up  with their wraps over their heads. The other set of people are  called Bramans, and are priests and the persons who administer and  direct the idolatry; they have very large houses of prayer, some of  them with revenues, others are maintained by alms. In these they  keep many idols: some of stone, some of wood, and other of copper.  In these houses and monasteries they always perform many ceremonies  to their gods; they make feasts for them magnificently, with  instruments and songs, and with many lights of oil, and they have  bells in our fashion. These Bramans have got images which represent  the Holy Trinity: they pay much honour to the number three, and in  trine make their adoration to God, whom they confess to be the true  God, Creator, and Maker of all things, which are three things in one  sole person; and they say that there are many other gods governed by  him, in which they also believe. These Bramans, wherever they find  our churches, enter willingly into them, and adore our images; and  they always ask for Santa Maria, our Lady, like men who have some  knowledge of her. And as they see our manner of honouring the  churches, they say that there is no great difference between them  and us. These Bramans go bare from the waist upwards; they wear upon  their shoulder a thread of three threads, which is a sign by which  they are known to be Bramans. They are men who also do not eat  anything which receives death, nor do they kill anything. They hold  it to be a great ceremony to wash their bodies, and say that they  wash on that account. These Bramans, and also the Banians, marry in  our fashion, with one woman only, and only once. They make great  feasts at their weddings, which last many days, and there are many  people assembled at these very well dressed and decked out. These  festivities are magnificent. For the most part they are married when  very young, both men and women, and on the day of the betrothal, and  of the wedding, the couple are both of them seated on a  platform,[126] very much bedizened with gold and jewellery and  precious stones, and in front of them is a small table with an idol  covered with flowers, and many lighted oil lamps all round it; and  both of them have to remain there with their eyes fixed on that idol  from the morning until the evening, without eating or drinking, or  speaking to anybody during that time. The people make great  rejoicings over them with their instruments and songs and dances;  they let off many cannons, rockets and other fireworks to divert  themselves. And if the husband dies the woman does not marry again,  and so also does the husband should the wife die. And the children  are his rightful heirs; and Bramans must be sons of Bramans, amongst  whom there are some of a lower rank who serve as messengers and  travellers, and they go in security to all parts without any one  vexing them in any way. Even if there should be war or thieves, they  always pass safely. These are called _pater_.      OF THE KING AND THE LORDS OF GUZARAT, WHICH IS OF THE KINGDOM OF  CAMBAY.    The King of Guzarat is a great lord, both in revenue and people, and  extensive and rich territory. He is a Moor, as also are his  men-at-arms, as has been said. He has a large court of many knights,  and he is the lord of many horses and elephants, which are brought  for sale to this kingdom from the country of Malabar and Ceylon. And  with the horses and elephants he makes war upon the Gentiles of the  kingdom of Guzarat who do not pay obedience to him, and upon some  other kings with whom at times he is at war. And they make wooden  castles on the top of the elephants, which hold four men, who carry  bows and guns, and other weapons, and fight thence with the enemy.

Touched  on the Irish question.\"    \"Home Rule?\"    \"He mentioned it among other things.\"    \"And the professor went off?\"    \"Like a bomb.\"    \"He would. So now you have parted brass rags. It's a pity.\"    I agreed. I am glad to say that I suppressed the desire to ask him to  use his influence, if any, with Mr. Derrick to effect a reconciliation.  I felt that I must play the game. To request one's rival to give one  assistance in the struggle, to the end that he may be the more readily  cut out, can hardly be considered cricket.    \"I ought not to be speaking to you, you know,\" said Mr. Chase. \"You're  under arrest.\"    \"He's still----?\" I stopped for a word.    \"Very much so. I'll do what I can.\"    \"It's very good of you.\"    \"But the time is not yet ripe. He may be said at present to be  simmering down.\"    \"I see. Thanks. Good-bye.\"    \"So long.\"    And Mr. Chase walked on with long strides to the Cob.    The days passed slowly. I saw nothing more of Phyllis or her sister.  The professor I met once or twice on the links. I had taken earnestly  to golf in this time of stress. Golf is the game of disappointed  lovers. On the other hand, it does not follow that because a man is a  failure as a lover he will be any good at all on the links. My game was  distinctly poor at first. But a round or two put me back into my proper  form, which is fair.    The professor's demeanour at these accidental meetings on the links was  a faithful reproduction of his attitude on the beach. Only by a studied  imitation of the Absolute Stranger did he show that he had observed my  presence.    Once or twice, after dinner, when Ukridge was smoking one of his  special cigars while Mrs. Ukridge nursed Edwin (now moving in society  once more, and in his right mind), I lit my pipe and walked out across  the fields through the cool summer night till I came to the hedge that  shut off the Derrick's grounds. Not the hedge through which I had made  my first entrance, but another, lower, and nearer the house. Standing  there under the shade of a tree I could see the lighted windows of the  drawing-room. Generally there was music inside, and, the windows being  opened on account of the warmth of the night, I was able to make myself  a little more miserable by hearing Phyllis sing. It deepened the  feeling of banishment.    I shall never forget those furtive visits. The intense stillness of the  night, broken by an occasional rustling in the grass or the hedge; the  smell of the flowers in the garden beyond; the distant drone of the sea.      \"God makes sech nights, all white and still,       Fur'z you to look and listen.\"    Another day had generally begun before I moved from my hiding-place,  and started for home, surprised to find my limbs stiff and my clothes  bathed with dew.        CHAPTER X    I ENLIST THE SERVICES OF A MINION    It would be interesting to know to what extent the work of authors is  influenced by their private affairs. If life is flowing smoothly, are  the novels they write in that period of content coloured with optimism?  And if things are running crosswise, do they work off the resultant  gloom on their faithful public? If, for instance, Mr. W. W. Jacobs had  toothache, would he write like Hugh Walpole? If Maxim Gorky were  invited to lunch by Trotsky, to meet Lenin, would he sit down and dash  off a trifle in the vein of Stephen Leacock? Probably the eminent have  the power of detaching their writing self from their living, work-a-day  self; but, for my own part, the frame of mind in which I now found  myself had a disastrous effect on my novel that was to be. I had  designed it as a light comedy effort. Here and there a page or two to  steady the reader and show him what I could do in the way of pathos if  I cared to try; but in the main a thing of sunshine and laughter. But  now great slabs of gloom began to work themselves into the scheme of  it. A magnificent despondency became its keynote. It would not do. I  felt that I must make a resolute effort to shake off my depression.  More than ever the need of conciliating the professor was borne in upon  me. Day and night I spurred my brain to think of some suitable means of  engineering a reconciliation.    In the meantime I worked hard among the fowls, drove furiously on the  links, and swam about the harbour when the affairs of the farm did not  require my attention.    Things were not going well on our model chicken farm. Little accidents  marred the harmony of life in the fowl-run. On one occasion a hen--not  Aunt Elizabeth, I am sorry to say,--fell into a pot of tar, and came  out an unspeakable object. Ukridge put his spare pair of tennis shoes  in the incubator to dry them, and permanently spoiled the future of  half-a-dozen eggs which happened to have got there first. Chickens kept  straying into the wrong coops, where they got badly pecked by the  residents. Edwin slew a couple of Wyandottes, and was only saved from  execution by the tears of Mrs. Ukridge.    In spite of these occurrences, however, his buoyant optimism never  deserted Ukridge.    \"After all,\" he said, \"What's one bird more or less? Yes, I know I made  a fuss when that beast of a cat lunched off those two, but that was  simply the principle of the thing. I'm not going to pay large sums for  chickens purely in order that a cat which I've never liked can lunch  well. Still, we've plenty left, and the eggs are coming in better now,  though we've still a deal of leeway to make up yet in that line. I got  a letter from Whiteley's this morning asking when my first consignment  was going to arrive. You know, these people make a mistake in hurrying  a man. It annoys him. It irritates him. When we really get going,  Garny, my boy, I shall drop Whiteley's. I shall cut them out of my list  and send my eggs to their trade rivals. They shall have a sharp lesson.  It's a little hard. Here am I, worked to death looking after things  down here, and these men have the impertinence to bother me about their  wretched business. Come in and have a drink, laddie, and let's talk it  over.\"    It was on the morning after this that I heard him calling me in a voice  in which I detected agitation. I was strolling about the paddock, as  was my habit after breakfast, thinking about Phyllis and trying to get  my novel into shape. I had just framed a more than usually murky scene  for use in the earlier part of the book, when Ukridge shouted to me  from the fowl-run.    \"Garny, come here. I want you to see the most astounding thing.\"    \"What's the matter?\" I asked.    \"Blast if I know. Look at those chickens. They've been doing that for  the last half-hour.\"    I inspected the chickens. There was certainly something the matter with  them. They were yawning--broadly, as if we bored them. They stood about  singly and in groups, opening and shutting their beaks. It was an  uncanny spectacle.    \"What's the matter with them?\"    \"Can a chicken get a fit of the blues?\" I asked. \"Because if so, that's  what they've got. I never saw a more bored-looking lot of birds.\"    \"Oh, do look at that poor little brown one by the coop,\" said Mrs.  Ukridge sympathetically; \"I'm sure it's not well. See, it's lying down.  What _can_ be the matter with it?\"    \"I tell you what we'll do,\" said Ukridge. \"We'll ask Beale. He once  lived with an aunt who kept fowls. He'll know all about it. Beale!\"    No answer.    \"Beale!!\"    A sturdy form in shirt-sleeves appeared through the bushes, carrying a  boot. We seemed to have interrupted him in the act of cleaning it.    \"Beale, you know all about fowls. What's the matter with these  chickens?\"    The Hired Retainer examined the blase birds with a wooden expression on  his face.    \"Well?\" said Ukridge.    \"The 'ole thing 'ere,\" said the Hired Retainer, \"is these 'ere fowls  have been and got the roop.\"    I had never heard of the disease before, but it sounded bad.    \"Is that what makes them yawn like that?\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"Poor things!\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"And have they all got it?\"    \"Yes, ma'am.\"    \"What ought we to do?\" asked Ukridge.    \"Well, my aunt, sir, when 'er fowls 'ad the roop, she gave them snuff.\"    \"Give them snuff, she did,\" he repeated, with relish, \"every morning.\"    \"Snuff!\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    \"Yes, ma'am. She give 'em snuff till their eyes bubbled.\"    Mrs. Ukridge uttered a faint squeak at this vivid piece of  word-painting.    \"And did it cure them?\" asked Ukridge.    \"No, sir,\" responded the expert soothingly.    \"Oh, go away, Beale, and clean your beastly boots,\" said Ukridge.  \"You're no use. Wait a minute. Who would know about this infernal roop  thing? One of those farmer chaps would, I suppose. Beale, go off to the  nearest farmer, and give him my compliments, and ask him what he does  when his fowls get the roop.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"No, I'll go, Ukridge,\" I said. \"I want some exercise.\"    I whistled to Bob, who was investigating a mole-heap in the paddock,  and set off in the direction of the village of Up Lyme to consult  Farmer Leigh on the matter. He had sold us some fowls shortly after our  arrival, so might be expected to feel a kindly interest in their ailing  families.    The path to Up Lyme lies across deep-grassed meadows. At intervals it  passes over a stream by means of a footbridge. The stream curls through  the meadows like a snake.    And at the first of these bridges I met Phyllis.    I came upon her quite suddenly. The other end of the bridge was hidden  from my view. I could hear somebody coming through the grass, but not  till I was on the bridge did I see who it was. We reached the bridge  simultaneously. She was alone. She carried a sketching-block. All nice  girls sketch a little.    There was room for one alone on the footbridge, and I drew back to let  her pass.    It being the privilege of woman to make the first sign of recognition,  I"]]]
