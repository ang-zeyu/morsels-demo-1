[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#11)"],[1," this condition, as the  prophets have foretold, when the boy Prophet began so marvelous a work,  and which cost him his life to establish.    CHAPTER 5    The Prophet Joseph and others Sentenced to be Shot on the Public Square  at Far West, in the Presence of their Friends.--The Execution Deferred,  and the Prisoners afterwards sent to Liberty Jail.    The Liberty Jail, which is fast going into ruins, is situated in the  city of Liberty, Clay County, Missouri. It is inland three miles from  the Missouri River and about ten miles from Independence in Jackson  County, and Independence is eleven miles from Kansas City of the same  state.    There are many reasons why this jail should become conspicuous and  be preserved in history, but the principal one is that there Joseph  Smith, the Prophet, in the fall of 1838 and spring of 1839, at the  time of Governor L. W. Boggs' exterminating war against the Mormons,  was most unjustly and wickedly imprisoned. In 1838, the Prophet and  others were betrayed into the hands of the Missouri mob by Colonel  George M. Hinkle, the mob being headed by General Samuel D. Lucas. The  prisoners were tried under martial law and sentenced to be shot on  the following day on the public square in Far West, in the presence  of a multitude of the followers of \"Joe\" Smith, as they chose to call  him. This was intended, no doubt, as a sample of Missouri charity,  sympathy and humanity, and as a lesson for Mormons for daring to  believe as conscience dictated, and for exercising as American freemen  the privileges guaranteed by a Constitution believed to be inspired.  The writer speaks for himself, as one for whom he had deep sentiments  of regard, as a true Prophet, who was sent of God to re-establish the  fullness of the everlasting gospel.    But God overruled the horrible edict that the Prophet and his  companions should be shot on the public square on the following day at  8 o'clock a.m. This was on the 31st of October, 1838. General Doniphan  denounced the proposed act as \"cold-blooded murder,\" threatening to  withdraw his brigade from the scene of the intended massacre.    This turned the tide of events and Lucas and his murderous colleagues  began to hesitate and finally to reconsider their action. That General  Lucas was acting under Governor Lilburn W. Boggs' orders is evident by  the utterances made unto us who were compelled to assemble together  on the public square at Far West, where we were harangued by General  Clark at considerable length. The speech was very abusive, as can be  learned by reading it farther on in this pamphlet. Before introducing  the speech we will state a number of interesting facts which occurred  about that time. There was in existence the Fifty-third Regiment of  Missouri Militia, under the command of Col. George M. Hinkle, who held  a commission signed by the Governor of the state.    There was times of trouble when it became necessary for Colonel Hinkle  to call out the militia, consequently our movements were in accordance  with the laws of Missouri. On the 30th of October, 1838, Neil Gillam  was at the head of a mob who were disguised as wild Indians. They were  painted, and Gillam himself was arrayed as an Indian chief. The mob  had been burning houses and driving the Mormons' stock away from their  owners, taking prisoners, etc. Colonel Hinkle ordered out a company  of militia, about 150 in number, to endeavor to learn the intentions  of Gillam and others, who were camping on Log Creek, near Far West. I  was one of those under Col. Hinkle, and we all were on horseback. We  soon learned that their intentions were hostile. A flag of truce in the  hands of Charles C. Rich was shot at during the day, and our company  was cut off from Far West by a line of battle being formed between us  and our homes. Colonel Hinkle returned from the front of our line with  his military coat off, saying that there were hardly enough of us to  allow a mouthful apiece for the numerous hosts before us. He seemed  excited and fearfully frightened, and for this and other reasons I have  always believed this accounted for his conduct on that occasion. We  retreated fifteen miles (instead of five miles, from where we were),  to Far West, arriving about the time the troops were nearing the city.  They were marching with red flags, which were interspersed and mixed  up with Gillam's command of painted faces. Our company coming into Far  West on the gallop, created quite a sensation, as we were mistaken  for the enemy coming in from two different points. We, however, soon  proved ourselves to be friends, and were just in time to extend the  line already formed in defense of the city. Our adversaries were in  the ratio of about ten to one of us, which looked rather serious for a  little handful of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints.    The Prophet came along after our arrival and said:    \"Fear them not; God is for us, and there are more for us than there  are against us [meaning the hosts of heaven were on our side.] God  and liberty is the watchword,\" said Joseph. \"Fear them not, for their  hearts are cold as cucumbers.\"    Night was fast approaching, and flags of truce were passing between  the two lines, by which we learned that this formidable army was sent  out by Governor Boggs with orders to exterminate us. It was finally  concluded not to murder us that night, so the army withdrew until the  next morning, when they intended to make a final end of Mormonism.  They camped for the night on Goose Creek, one mile away from the city.  Thus ended one of the most eventful days of our lives. It fell to my  lot to stand guard that night, and the worst confusion and disorder  ever witnessed by human beings existed in the enemy's camp. This, with  unearthly yelling and howling, produced a real pandemonium very much  resembling my idea of hell. A sort of breast-work was constructed  during the night, made principally of wagons, house logs, etc. A dark  and dreary night was that. On the following day, October 31st, we  were preparing to meet death, if necessary, rather than surrender our  religion to a mob. We trusted in the Lord, however, and a better way  was prepared. Colonel Hinkle had been communicating with the enemy  during the day, and in the afternoon Joseph Smith and others passed  over the breast-works near where I and others were on duty. Colonel  Hinkle lead the party to meet the enemy, where he betrayed them into  their hands. This treachery on his part turned out for the best, for  God suffers offences to come, as in the case of Judas, \"but woe to him  by whom they come.\"    On the following day, November 1st, 1838, we were marched into a hollow  square just outside of the city, where we delivered up about 630 guns,  grounded our arms, and advanced to the center of the square, where the  small arms and swords were left in a pile. The late Bishop McRae gave  six cuts with his sword and a pointer in the ground and left his sword  sticking there. We were left without the means of self-defense and at  the mercy of a conscienceless set of ignorant, prejudiced people, many  of whom, like St. Paul before his conversion, acted as if they were  doing God's service in destroying property and abusing the Mormons. My  widowed mother's house was plundered and my sister, now living here in  Utah, had her clothes taken from her in open day, leaving her destitute  of her necessary apparel.    General Wilson, who was one of the mobbers in Jackson County, was in  company with Joseph Smith soon after he was condemned to be shot.  Joseph asked General Wilson what he had done that he should be treated  with such indignity, stating that he had always been a supporter of the  Constitution and of good government. Wilson's reply was:    \"I know it, and that is the reason I want to kill you, or have you  killed.\"    Subsequently this same Wilson said to P. P. Pratt and others:    \"We Jackson County boys know how it is, and therefore have not the  extreme hatred and prejudice which characterizes the rest of the  troops. We know perfectly well from the beginning that the Mormons  have not been the aggressors at all. As it began in 1833 in Jackson  County, Mo., so it has been ever since.... We mob you without law;  the authorities refuse to protect you according to law, you then are  compelled to protect yourselves, and we act upon the prejudices of  the public, who join our forces and the whole is legalized for your  destruction and our gain ... When we drove you from Jackson County  we burned 203 of your houses, plundered your goods, destroyed your  press, type and paper, books, office and all--tarred and feathered old  Bishop Partridge--as exemplary an old man as you can find anywhere. We  shot down some of your men, and if any of you returned the fire, we  imprisoned you and had you on trial for murder. D--d shrewdly done,  gentlemen; and I came d--d near kicking the bucket myself; for on  one occasion while we were tearing down houses, driving families and  destroying and plundering goods, some of you good folks put a ball  through my son's body, and another through the arm of my clerk, and a  third pierced my shirt collar and marked my neck. No blame, gentlemen;  we deserved it, and let a set of men serve me as your community have  been served, and I'll be d--d if I would not fight till I died.\"    Most certainly this was an honest confession, and I can certify to  nearly all of his acknowledgments, for I have been driven from my home  and robbed of my hard-earned property more than once. There are many  others besides General Wilson who have acknowledged to the same things,  for I have personally heard them.    When the brethren were being hurried away, as prisoners, from their  homes, P. P. Pratt says:    \"I went to General Moses Wilson in tears, and stated the circumstances  of my sick, heart-broken, destitute family, in terms which would have  moved any heart "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/544"],[0,"Anne's House of Dreams (#11)"],[1,"of faith ever saw.    \"Yes, we are, dearie.  Thank goodness, we can choose our friends.  We  have to take our relatives as they are, and be thankful if there are no  penitentiary birds among them.  Not that I've many--none nearer than  second cousins.  I'm a kind of lonely soul, Mrs. Blythe.\"    There was a wistful note in Miss Cornelia's voice.    \"I wish you would call me Anne,\" exclaimed Anne impulsively.  \"It would  seem more HOMEY.  Everyone in Four Winds, except my husband, calls me  Mrs. Blythe, and it makes me feel like a stranger.  Do you know that  your name is very near being the one I yearned after when I was a  child.  I hated 'Anne' and I called myself 'Cordelia' in imagination.\"    \"I like Anne.  It was my mother's name.  Old-fashioned names are the  best and sweetest in my opinion.  If you're going to get tea you might  send the young doctor to talk to me.  He's been lying on the sofa in  that office ever since I came, laughing fit to kill over what I've been  saying.\"    \"How did you know?\" cried Anne, too aghast at this instance of Miss  Cornelia's uncanny prescience to make a polite denial.    \"I saw him sitting beside you when I came up the lane, and I know men's  tricks,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"There, I've finished my little  dress, dearie, and the eighth baby can come as soon as it pleases.\"        CHAPTER 9    AN EVENING AT FOUR WINDS POINT    It was late September when Anne and Gilbert were able to pay Four Winds  light their promised visit.  They had often planned to go, but  something always occurred to prevent them.  Captain Jim had \"dropped  in\" several times at the little house.    \"I don't stand on ceremony, Mistress Blythe,\" he told Anne.  \"It's a  real pleasure to me to come here, and I'm not going to deny myself jest  because you haven't got down to see me.  There oughtn't to be no  bargaining like that among the race that knows Joseph.  I'll come when  I can, and you come when you can, and so long's we have our pleasant  little chat it don't matter a mite what roof's over us.\"    Captain Jim took a great fancy to Gog and Magog, who were presiding  over the destinies of the hearth in the little house with as much  dignity and aplomb as they had done at Patty's Place.    \"Aren't they the cutest little cusses?\" he would say delightedly; and  he bade them greeting and farewell as gravely and invariably as he did  his host and hostess.  Captain Jim was not going to offend household  deities by any lack of reverence and ceremony.    \"You've made this little house just about perfect,\" he told Anne.  \"It  never was so nice before.  Mistress Selwyn had your taste and she did  wonders; but folks in those days didn't have the pretty little curtains  and pictures and nicknacks you have.  As for Elizabeth, she lived in  the past.  You've kinder brought the future into it, so to speak.  I'd  be real happy even if we couldn't talk at all, when I come here--jest  to sit and look at you and your pictures and your flowers would be  enough of a treat.  It's beautiful--beautiful.\"    Captain Jim was a passionate worshipper of beauty.  Every lovely thing  heard or seen gave him a deep, subtle, inner joy that irradiated his  life.  He was quite keenly aware of his own lack of outward comeliness  and lamented it.    \"Folks say I'm good,\" he remarked whimsically upon one occasion, \"but I  sometimes wish the Lord had made me only half as good and put the rest  of it into looks.  But there, I reckon He knew what He was about, as a  good Captain should.  Some of us have to be homely, or the purty  ones--like Mistress Blythe here--wouldn't show up so well.\"    One evening Anne and Gilbert finally walked down to the Four Winds  light.  The day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist, but it had  ended in a pomp of scarlet and gold.  Over the western hills beyond the  harbor were amber deeps and crystalline shallows, with the fire of  sunset below.  The north was a mackerel sky of little, fiery golden  clouds.  The red light flamed on the white sails of a vessel gliding  down the channel, bound to a southern port in a land of palms.  Beyond  her, it smote upon and incarnadined the shining, white, grassless faces  of the sand dunes.  To the right, it fell on the old house among the  willows up the brook, and gave it for a fleeting space casements more  splendid than those of an old cathedral.  They glowed out of its quiet  and grayness like the throbbing, blood-red thoughts of a vivid soul  imprisoned in a dull husk of environment.    \"That old house up the brook always seems so lonely,\" said Anne.  \"I  never see visitors there.  Of course, its lane opens on the upper  road--but I don't think there's much coming and going.  It seems odd  we've never met the Moores yet, when they live within fifteen minutes'  walk of us.  I may have seen them in church, of course, but if so I  didn't know them.  I'm sorry they are so unsociable, when they are our  only near neighbors.\"    \"Evidently they don't belong to the race that knows Joseph,\" laughed  Gilbert.  \"Have you ever found out who that girl was whom you thought  so beautiful?\"    \"No.  Somehow I have never remembered to ask about her.  But I've never  seen her anywhere, so I suppose she must have been a stranger.  Oh, the  sun has just vanished--and there's the light.\"    As the dusk deepened, the great beacon cut swathes of light through it,  sweeping in a circle over the fields and the harbor, the sandbar and  the gulf.    \"I feel as if it might catch me and whisk me leagues out to sea,\" said  Anne, as one drenched them with radiance; and she felt rather relieved  when they got so near the Point that they were inside the range of  those dazzling, recurrent flashes.    As they turned into the little lane that led across the fields to the  Point they met a man coming out of it--a man of such extraordinary  appearance that for a moment they both frankly stared.  He was a  decidedly fine-looking person-tall, broad-shouldered, well-featured,  with a Roman nose and frank gray eyes; he was dressed in a prosperous  farmer's Sunday best; in so far he might have been any inhabitant of  Four Winds or the Glen.  But, flowing over his breast nearly to his  knees, was a river of crinkly brown beard; and adown his back, beneath  his commonplace felt hat, was a corresponding cascade of thick, wavy,  brown hair.    \"Anne,\" murmured Gilbert, when they were out of earshot, \"you didn't  put what Uncle Dave calls 'a little of the Scott Act' in that lemonade  you gave me just before we left home, did you?\"    \"No, I didn't,\" said Anne, stifling her laughter, lest the retreating  enigma should hear here.  \"Who in the world can he be?\"    \"I don't know; but if Captain Jim keeps apparitions like that down at  this Point I'm going to carry cold iron in my pocket when I come here.  He wasn't a sailor, or one might pardon his eccentricity of appearance;  he must belong to the over-harbor clans.  Uncle Dave says they have  several freaks over there.\"    \"Uncle Dave is a little prejudiced, I think.  You know all the  over-harbor people who come to the Glen Church seem very nice.  Oh,  Gilbert, isn't this beautiful?\"    The Four Winds light was built on a spur of red sand-stone cliff  jutting out into the gulf.  On one side, across the channel, stretched  the silvery sand shore of the bar; on the other, extended a long,  curving beach of red cliffs, rising steeply from the pebbled coves.  It  was a shore that knew the magic and mystery of storm and star.  There  is a great solitude about such a shore.  The woods are never  solitary--they are full of whispering, beckoning, friendly life.  But  the sea is a mighty soul, forever moaning of some great, unshareable  sorrow, which shuts it up into itself for all eternity.  We can never  pierce its infinite mystery--we may only wander, awed and spellbound,  on the outer fringe of it.  The woods call to us with a hundred voices,  but the sea has one only--a mighty voice that drowns our souls in its  majestic music.  The woods are human, but the sea is of the company of  the archangels.    Anne and Gilbert found Uncle Jim sitting on a bench outside the  lighthouse, putting the finishing touches to a wonderful, full-rigged,  toy schooner.  He rose and welcomed them to his abode with the gentle,  unconscious courtesy that became him so well.    \"This has been a purty nice day all through, Mistress Blythe, and now,  right at the last, it's brought its best.  Would you like to sit down  here outside a bit, while the light lasts?  I've just finished this bit  of a plaything for my little grand nephew, Joe, up at the Glen.  After  I promised to make it for him I was kinder sorry, for his mother was  vexed.  She's afraid he'll be wanting to go to sea later on and she  doesn't want the notion encouraged in him.  But what could I do,  Mistress Blythe?  I'd PROMISED him, and I think it's sorter real  dastardly to break a promise you make to a child.  Come, sit down.  It  won't take long to stay an hour.\"    The wind was off shore, and only broke the sea's surface into long,  silvery ripples, and sent sheeny shadows flying out across it, from  every point and headland, like transparent wings.  The dusk was hanging  a curtain of violet gloom over the sand dunes and the headlands where  gulls were huddling.  The sky was faintly filmed over with scarfs of  silken vapor.  Cloud fleets rode at anchor along the horizons.  An  evening star was watching over the bar.    \"Isn't that a view worth looking at?\" said Captain Jim, with a loving,  proprietary pride.  \"Nice and far from the market-place, ain't it?  No  buying and selling and getting gain.  You don't have to pay  anything--all that sea and sky free--'without money and without price.'  There's going to be a moonrise purty soon, too--I'm never tired of  finding out what a moonrise can be over them rocks and sea and harbor.  There's a surprise in it every time.\"    They had their moonrise, and watched "]]]
