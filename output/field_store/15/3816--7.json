For after the masque was  finished (in which we presume there had been a little dancing by the  lawyers who, would, as in duty bound, have stood on their wigs to  please her Majesty), and on the courtiers attempting, in _their_ turn,  to execute a dance, her Majesty was most graciously pleased to exclaim,  \"What! shall we have bread and cheese after a banquet?\"--meaning  thereby, we presume, to imply that the courtiers could not hope to leap  as high or, in any respect, to cut such capers as the lawyers had done.  Now, this speech of the virgin queen we have reported here less for the  sake of any intrinsic greatness in the thought or elegance in the form  than because, out of a variety of speeches by her Majesty, which have  been carefully preserved, we think this is about as good as any other,  and has the additional recommendation (which so few of the others have)  of exhibiting the virgin queen in a good humor. And, further, because  having recorded the disgrace into which the gentlemen of Gray's Inn  danced themselves, in the lifetime of her illustrious father, it is but  right that we should likewise record the ample indemnification which  they must have considered themselves to have received, at the lips of  his virgin daughter.    The celebrations at the Inns of Court were from time to time continued,  down to the period of the civil troubles which darkened the reign of  Charles I.; and so lately as the year 1641, when they had already  commenced, we find it recorded by Evelyn, in his Memoirs, that he was  elected one of the comptrollers of the Middle Temple revellers, \"as the  fashion of the young students and gentlemen was, the Christmas being  kept this yeare with greate solemnity.\" During this reign, we discover  the several societies lessening their expenses by a very wise compromise  of their disputes for supremacy; for in the eighth year thereof the four  Inns of Court provided a Christmas masque in conjunction, for the  entertainment of the court, which cost the startling sum of L24,000 of  the money of that day, and in return King Charles invited one hundred  and twenty gentlemen of the four Inns to a masque at Whitehall on the  Shrove-Tuesday following.    That our readers may form some idea of the kind of sports which  furnished entertainment to men of no less pretension than Hatton and  Coke and Crewe, we will extract for them a few more particulars of the  ceremonies usually observed at the grand Christmases of the Inner  Temple, before quitting this part of the subject.    In the first place, it appears that on Christmas Eve there was a banquet  in the hall, at which three masters of the revels were present, the  oldest of whom, after dinner and supper, was to sing a carol, and to  command other gentlemen to sing with him; and in all this we see nothing  which is not perfectly worthy of all imitation now. Then, on each of the  twelve nights, before and after supper were revels and dancing; and if  any of these revels and dancing were performed in company with the fair  sex (which, on the face of the evidence, doth not appear), then we have  none of the objections to urge against them which we have ventured to  insinuate against the solemn buffooneries, to which the bar was fined  for refusing to surrender itself, in the time of James I. Neither do we  find anything repugnant to our modern tastes in the announcement that  the breakfasts of the following mornings were very substantial ones,  consisting of brawn, mustard, and malmsey, which the exhaustion of the  previous night's dancing might render necessary; nor that all the  courses were served with music, which we intend that some of our own  shall be this coming Christmas. But against most of that which follows  we enter our decided protest, as not only very absurd in itself, but  eminently calculated to spoil a good dinner.    On St. Stephen's Day, we learn that, after the first course was served  in, the constable marshal was wont to enter the hall (and we think he  had much better have come in, and said all he had to say beforehand)  bravely arrayed with \"a fair rich compleat harneys, white and bright and  gilt, with a nest of fethers, of all colours, upon his crest or helm,  and a gilt pole ax in his hand,\" and, no doubt, thinking himself a  prodigiously fine fellow. He was accompanied by the lieutenant of the  Tower, \"armed with a fair white armour,\" also wearing \"fethers,\" and  \"with a like pole ax in his hand,\" and of course also thinking himself a  very fine fellow. With them came sixteen trumpeters, preceded by four  drums and fifes, and attended by four men clad in white \"harneys,\" from  the middle upwards, having halberds in their hands, and bearing on their  shoulders a model of the Tower, and each and every one of these latter  personages, in his degree, having a consciousness that he, too, was a  fine fellow. Then all these fine fellows, with the drums and music, and  with all their \"fethers\" and finery, went three times round the fire,  whereas, considering that the boar's head was cooling all the time, we  think once might have sufficed. Then the constable marshal, after three  courtesies, knelt down before the Lord Chancellor, with the lieutenant  doing the same behind him, and then and there deliberately proceeded to  deliver himself of an \"oration of a quarter of an hour's length,\" the  purport of which was to tender his services to the Lord Chancellor,  which, we think, at such a time he might have contrived to do in fewer  words. To this the Chancellor was unwise enough to reply that he would  \"take farther advice therein,\" when it would have been much better for  him to settle the matter at once, and proceed to eat his dinner.  However, this part of the ceremony ended at last by the constable  marshal and the lieutenant obtaining seats at the Chancellor's table,  upon the former giving up his sword: and then enter, for a similar  purpose, the master of the game, apparelled in green velvet, and the  ranger of the forest, in a green suit of \"satten,\" bearing in his hand a  green bow, and \"divers\" arrows, \"with either of them a hunting-horn  about their necks, blowing together three blasts of venery.\" These  worthies, also, thought it necessary to parade their finery three times  around the fire; and having then made similar obeisances, and offered up  a similar petition in a similar posture, they were finally inducted into  a similar privilege.    But though seated at the Chancellor's table, and no doubt sufficiently  roused by the steam of its good things, they were far enough as yet from  getting anything to eat, as a consequence; and the next ceremony is one  which strikingly marks the rudeness of the times. \"A huntsman cometh  into the hall, with a fox, and a purse-net with a cat, both bound at the  end of a staff, and with them nine or ten couple of hounds, with the  blowing of hunting-horns. And the fox and the cat are set upon by the  hounds, and killed beneath the fire.\" \"What this 'merry disport'  signified (if practised) before the Reformation,\" says a writer in Mr.  Hone's Year Book, \"I know not. In 'Ane compendious boke of godly and  spiritual songs, Edinburgh, 1621, printed from an old copy,' are the  following lines, seemingly referring to some such pageant:--        'The hunter is Christ that hunts in haist,       The hunds are Peter and Pawle,       The paip is the fox, Rome is the Rox       That rubbis us on the gall.'\"    After these ceremonies, the welcome permission to betake themselves to  the far more interesting one of an attack upon the good things of the  feast appears to have been at length given; but at the close of the  second course the subject of receiving the officers who had tendered  their Christmas service was renewed. Whether the gentlemen of the law  were burlesquing their own profession intentionally or whether it was  only an awkward _hit_, like that which befell their brethren of Gray's  Inn, does not appear. However, the common serjeant made what is called  \"a plausible speech,\" insisting on the necessity of these officers \"for  the better reputation of the Commonwealth;\" and he was followed, to the  same effect, by the king's serjeant-at-law till the Lord Chancellor  silenced them by desiring a respite of further advice, which it is  greatly to be marvelled he had not done sooner. And thereupon he called  upon the \"ancientest of the masters of the revels\" for a song,--a  proceeding to which we give our unqualified approbation.    So much for the dinner. After supper, the constable marshal again  presented himself, if possible finer than before, preceded by drums,--as  so fine a man ought to be,--and mounted on a scaffold borne by four men.  After again going thrice round the hearth, he dismounted from his  elevation, and having set a good example by first playing the figurant  himself for the edification of the court, called upon the nobles, by  their respective Christmas names, to do the same. Of the styles and  titles which it was considered humorous to assume on such occasions, and  by which he called up his courtiers to dance, our readers may take the  following for specimens:--    \"Sir Francis Flatterer, of Fowlehurst, in the county of Buckingham.\"    \"Sir Randle Rackabite, of Rascall Hall, in the county of Rabchell.\"    \"Sir Morgan Mumchance, of Much Monkery, in the county of Mad Popery.\"    And so on, with much more of the same kind, which we are sure our  readers will spare us, or rather thank us for sparing them. The  ceremonies of St. John's Day were, if possible, more absurd than those  by which St. Stephen was honored; but, that we may take leave of the  lawyers on good terms, and with a word of commendation, we will simply  add that the concluding one is stated to be that on the Thursday  following \"the Chancellor and company partook of dinner of roast beef  and venison pasties, and "]]]
