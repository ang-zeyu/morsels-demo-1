Notest thou not the remarkable resemblance between  this Holy Thern and thyself?\"    The man was indeed of my precise stature, nor were his eyes and  features unlike mine; but his hair was a mass of flowing yellow locks,  like those of the two I had killed, while mine is black and close  cropped.    \"What of the resemblance?\" I asked the girl Thuvia.  \"Do you wish me  with my black, short hair to pose as a yellow-haired priest of this  infernal cult?\"    She smiled, and for answer approached the body of the man she had  slain, and kneeling beside it removed the circlet of gold from the  forehead, and then to my utter amazement lifted the entire scalp bodily  from the corpse's head.    Rising, she advanced to my side and placing the yellow wig over my  black hair, crowned me with the golden circlet set with the magnificent  gem.    \"Now don his harness, Prince,\" she said, \"and you may pass where you  will in the realms of the therns, for Sator Throg was a Holy Thern of  the Tenth Cycle, and mighty among his kind.\"    As I stooped to the dead man to do her bidding I noted that not a hair  grew upon his head, which was quite as bald as an egg.    \"They are all thus from birth,\" explained Thuvia noting my surprise.  \"The race from which they sprang were crowned with a luxuriant growth  of golden hair, but for many ages the present race has been entirely  bald.  The wig, however, has come to be a part of their apparel, and so  important a part do they consider it that it is cause for the deepest  disgrace were a thern to appear in public without it.\"    In another moment I stood garbed in the habiliments of a Holy Thern.    At Thuvia's suggestion two of the released prisoners bore the body of  the dead thern upon their shoulders with us as we continued our journey  toward the storeroom, which we reached without further mishap.    Here the keys which Thuvia bore from the dead thern of the prison vault  were the means of giving us immediate entrance to the chamber, and very  quickly we were thoroughly outfitted with arms and ammunition.    By this time I was so thoroughly fagged out that I could go no further,  so I threw myself upon the floor, bidding Tars Tarkas to do likewise,  and cautioning two of the released prisoners to keep careful watch.    In an instant I was asleep.          CHAPTER V    CORRIDORS OF PERIL      How long I slept upon the floor of the storeroom I do not know, but it  must have been many hours.    I was awakened with a start by cries of alarm, and scarce were my eyes  opened, nor had I yet sufficiently collected my wits to quite realize  where I was, when a fusillade of shots rang out, reverberating through  the subterranean corridors in a series of deafening echoes.    In an instant I was upon my feet.  A dozen lesser therns confronted us  from a large doorway at the opposite end of the storeroom from which we  had entered.  About me lay the bodies of my companions, with the  exception of Thuvia and Tars Tarkas, who, like myself, had been asleep  upon the floor and thus escaped the first raking fire.    As I gained my feet the therns lowered their wicked rifles, their faces  distorted in mingled chagrin, consternation, and alarm.    Instantly I rose to the occasion.    \"What means this?\" I cried in tones of fierce anger.  \"Is Sator Throg  to be murdered by his own vassals?\"    \"Have mercy, O Master of the Tenth Cycle!\" cried one of the fellows,  while the others edged toward the doorway as though to attempt a  surreptitious escape from the presence of the mighty one.    \"Ask them their mission here,\" whispered Thuvia at my elbow.    \"What do you here, fellows?\" I cried.    \"Two from the outer world are at large within the dominions of the  therns.  We sought them at the command of the Father of Therns.  One  was white with black hair, the other a huge green warrior,\" and here  the fellow cast a suspicious glance toward Tars Tarkas.    \"Here, then, is one of them,\" spoke Thuvia, indicating the Thark, \"and  if you will look upon this dead man by the door perhaps you will  recognize the other.  It was left for Sator Throg and his poor slaves  to accomplish what the lesser therns of the guard were unable to do--we  have killed one and captured the other; for this had Sator Throg given  us our liberty.  And now in your stupidity have you come and killed all  but myself, and like to have killed the mighty Sator Throg himself.\"    The men looked very sheepish and very scared.    \"Had they not better throw these bodies to the plant men and then  return to their quarters, O Mighty One?\" asked Thuvia of me.    \"Yes; do as Thuvia bids you,\" I said.    As the men picked up the bodies I noticed that the one who stooped to  gather up the late Sator Throg started as his closer scrutiny fell upon  the upturned face, and then the fellow stole a furtive, sneaking glance  in my direction from the corner of his eye.    That he suspicioned something of the truth I could have sworn; but that  it was only a suspicion which he did not dare voice was evidenced by  his silence.    Again, as he bore the body from the room, he shot a quick but searching  glance toward me, and then his eyes fell once more upon the bald and  shiny dome of the dead man in his arms.  The last fleeting glimpse that  I obtained of his profile as he passed from my sight without the  chamber revealed a cunning smile of triumph upon his lips.    Only Tars Tarkas, Thuvia, and I were left.  The fatal marksmanship of  the therns had snatched from our companions whatever slender chance  they had of gaining the perilous freedom of the world without.    So soon as the last of the gruesome procession had disappeared the girl  urged us to take up our flight once more.    She, too, had noted the questioning attitude of the thern who had borne  Sator Throg away.    \"It bodes no good for us, O Prince,\" she said.  \"For even though this  fellow dared not chance accusing you in error, there be those above  with power sufficient to demand a closer scrutiny, and that, Prince,  would indeed prove fatal.\"    I shrugged my shoulders.  It seemed that in any event the outcome of  our plight must end in death.  I was refreshed from my sleep, but still  weak from loss of blood.  My wounds were painful.  No medicinal aid  seemed possible.  How I longed for the almost miraculous healing power  of the strange salves and lotions of the green Martian women.  In an  hour they would have had me as new.    I was discouraged.  Never had a feeling of such utter hopelessness come  over me in the face of danger.  Then the long flowing, yellow locks of  the Holy Thern, caught by some vagrant draught, blew about my face.    Might they not still open the way of freedom?  If we acted in time,  might we not even yet escape before the general alarm was sounded?  We  could at least try.    \"What will the fellow do first, Thuvia?\" I asked.  \"How long will it be  before they may return for us?\"    \"He will go directly to the Father of Therns, old Matai Shang.  He may  have to wait for an audience, but since he is very high among the  lesser therns, in fact as a thorian among them, it will not be long  that Matai Shang will keep him waiting.    \"Then if the Father of Therns puts credence in his story, another hour  will see the galleries and chambers, the courts and gardens, filled  with searchers.\"    \"What we do then must be done within an hour.  What is the best way,  Thuvia, the shortest way out of this celestial Hades?\"    \"Straight to the top of the cliffs, Prince,\" she replied, \"and then  through the gardens to the inner courts.  From there our way will lie  within the temples of the therns and across them to the outer court.  Then the ramparts--O Prince, it is hopeless.  Ten thousand warriors  could not hew a way to liberty from out this awful place.    \"Since the beginning of time, little by little, stone by stone, have  the therns been ever adding to the defences of their stronghold.  A  continuous line of impregnable fortifications circles the outer slopes  of the Mountains of Otz.    \"Within the temples that lie behind the ramparts a million fighting-men  are ever ready.  The courts and gardens are filled with slaves, with  women and with children.    \"None could go a stone's throw without detection.\"    \"If there is no other way, Thuvia, why dwell upon the difficulties of  this.  We must face them.\"    \"Can we not better make the attempt after dark?\" asked Tars Tarkas.  \"There would seem to be no chance by day.\"    \"There would be a little better chance by night, but even then the  ramparts are well guarded; possibly better than by day.  There are  fewer abroad in the courts and gardens, though,\" said Thuvia.    \"What is the hour?\" I asked.    \"It was midnight when you released me from my chains,\" said Thuvia.  \"Two hours later we reached the storeroom.  There you slept for  fourteen hours.  It must now be nearly sundown again.  Come, we will go  to some nearby window in the cliff and make sure.\"    So saying, she led the way through winding corridors until at a sudden  turn we came upon an opening which overlooked the Valley Dor.    At our right the sun was setting, a huge red orb, below the western  range of Otz.  A little below us stood the Holy Thern on watch upon his  balcony.  His scarlet robe of office was pulled tightly about him in  anticipation of the cold that comes so suddenly with darkness as the  sun sets.  So rare is the atmosphere of Mars that it absorbs very  little heat from the sun.  During the daylight hours it is always  extremely hot; at night it is intensely cold.  Nor does the thin  atmosphere refract the sun's rays or diffuse its light as upon Earth.  There is no twilight on Mars.  When the great orb of day disappears  beneath the horizon the effect is precisely as that of the  extinguishing of a single lamp within a chamber.  From brilliant light  you are plunged without warning into utter darkness.  Then the moons  come; the mysterious,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6422"],[0,"The Life, Adventures & Piracies of the Famous Captain Singleton (#11)"],[1,", it was some  Arabian vessel, which had been trading to the coast of Mozambique, or  Zanzibar, the same place where we afterwards went, as you shall hear.    I kept no journal of this voyage, nor indeed did I all this while  understand anything of navigation, more than the common business of a  foremast-man; so I can say nothing to the latitudes or distances of any  places we were at, how long we were going, or how far we sailed in  a day; but this I remember, that being now come round the island, we  sailed up the eastern shore due south, as we had done down the western  shore due north before.    Nor do I remember that the natives differed much from one another,  either in stature or complexion, or in their manners, their habits,  their weapons, or indeed in anything; and yet we could not perceive that  they had any intelligence one with another; but they were extremely kind  and civil to us on this side, as well as on the other.    We continued our voyage south for many weeks, though with several  intervals of going on shore to get provisions and water. At length,  coming round a point of land which lay about a league further than  ordinary into the sea, we were agreeably surprised with a sight which,  no doubt, had been as disagreeable to those concerned, as it was  pleasant to us. This was the wreck of an European ship, which had been  cast away upon the rocks, which in that place run a great way into the  sea.    We could see plainly, at low water, a great deal of the ship lay dry;  even at high water, she was not entirely covered; and that at most she  did not lie above a league from the shore. It will easily be believed  that our curiosity led us, the wind and weather also permitting, to  go directly to her, which we did without any difficulty, and presently  found that it was a Dutch-built ship, and that she could not have been  very long in that condition, a great deal of the upper work of her stern  remaining firm, with the mizzen-mast standing. Her stern seemed to be  jammed in between two ridges of the rock, and so remained fast, all the  fore part of the ship having been beaten to pieces.    We could see nothing to be gotten out of the wreck that was worth our  while; but we resolved to go on shore, and stay some time thereabouts,  to see if perhaps we might get any light into the story of her; and  we were not without hopes that we might hear something more particular  about her men, and perhaps find some of them on shore there, in the same  condition that we were in, and so might increase our company.    It was a very pleasant sight to us when, coming on shore, we saw all  the marks and tokens of a ship-carpenter's yard; as a launch-block and  cradles, scaffolds and planks, and pieces of planks, the remains of  the building a ship or vessel; and, in a word, a great many things  that fairly invited us to go about the same work; and we soon came to  understand that the men belonging to the ship that was lost had saved  themselves on shore, perhaps in their boat, and had built themselves a  barque or sloop, and so were gone to sea again; and, inquiring of the  natives which way they went, they pointed to the south and south-west,  by which we could easily understand they were gone away to the Cape of  Good Hope.    Nobody will imagine we could be so dull as not to gather from hence that  we might take the same method for our escape; so we resolved first, in  general, that we would try if possible to build us a boat of one kind or  other, and go to sea as our fate should direct.    In order to this our first work was to have the two carpenters search  about to see what materials the Dutchmen had left behind them that might  be of use; and, in particular, they found one that was very useful,  and which I was much employed about, and that was a pitch-kettle, and a  little pitch in it.    When we came to set close to this work we found it very laborious and  difficult, having but few tools, no ironwork, no cordage, no sails; so  that, in short, whatever we built, we were obliged to be our own smiths,  rope-makers, sail-makers, and indeed to practise twenty trades that we  knew little or nothing of. However, necessity was the spur to invention,  and we did many things which before we thought impracticable, that is to  say, in our circumstances.    After our two carpenters had resolved upon the dimensions of what they  would build, they set us all to work, to go off in our boats and split  up the wreck of the old ship, and to bring away everything we could; and  particularly that, if possible, we should bring away the mizzen-mast,  which was left standing, which with much difficulty we effected, after  above twenty days' labour of fourteen of our men.    At the same time we got out a great deal of ironwork, as bolts, spikes,  nails, &c., all of which our artist, of whom I have spoken already, who  was now grown a very dexterous smith, made us nails and hinges for our  rudder, and spikes such as we wanted.    But we wanted an anchor, and if we had had an anchor, we could not have  made a cable; so we contented ourselves with making some ropes with the  help of the natives, of such stuff as they made their mats of, and with  these we made such a kind of cable or tow-line as was sufficient to  fasten our vessel to the shore, which we contented ourselves with for  that time.    To be short, we spent four months here, and worked very hard too; at the  end of which time we launched our frigate, which, in a few words, had  many defects, but yet, all things considered, it was as well as we could  expect it to be.    In short, it was a kind of sloop, of the burthen of near eighteen  or twenty tons; and had we had masts and sails, standing and running  rigging, as is usual in such cases, and other conveniences, the vessel  might have carried us wherever we could have had a mind to go; but of  all the materials we wanted, this was the worst, viz., that we had no  tar or pitch to pay the seams and secure the bottom; and though we did  what we could, with tallow and oil, to make a mixture to supply that  part, yet we could not bring it to answer our end fully; and when we  launched her into the water, she was so leaky, and took in the water so  fast, that we thought all our labour had been lost, for we had much ado  to make her swim; and as for pumps, we had none, nor had we any means to  make one.    But at length one of the natives, a black negro-man, showed us a tree,  the wood of which being put into the fire, sends forth a liquid that is  as glutinous and almost as strong as tar, and of which, by boiling, we  made a sort of stuff which served us for pitch, and this answered our  end effectually; for we perfectly made our vessel sound and tight, so  that we wanted no pitch or tar at all. This secret has stood me in stead  upon many occasions since that time in the same place.    Our vessel being thus finished, out of the mizzen-mast of the ship we  made a very good mast to her, and fitted our sails to it as well as we  could; then we made a rudder and tiller, and, in a word, everything that  our present necessity called upon us for; and having victualled her, and  put as much fresh water on board as we thought we wanted, or as we knew  how to stow (for we were yet without casks), we put to sea with a fair  wind.    We had spent near another year in these rambles, and in this piece  of work; for it was now, as our men said, about the beginning of  our February, and the sun went from us apace, which was much to our  satisfaction, for the heats were exceedingly violent. The wind, as I  said, was fair; for, as I have since learned, the winds generally spring  up to the eastward, as the sun goes from them to the north.    Our debate now was, which way we should go, and never were men so  irresolute; some were for going to the east, and stretching away  directly for the coast of Malabar; but others, who considered more  seriously the length of that voyage, shook their heads at the proposal,  knowing very well that neither our provisions, especially of water,  or our vessel, were equal to such a run as that is, of near 2000 miles  without any land to touch at in the way.    These men, too, had all along had a great mind to a voyage for the  mainland of Africa, where they said we should have a fair cast for our  lives, and might be sure to make ourselves rich, which way soever we  went, if we were but able to make our way through, whether by sea or by  land.    Besides, as the case stood with us, we had not much choice for our way;  for, if we had resolved for the east, we were at the wrong season of the  year, and must have stayed till April or May before we had gone to sea.  At length, as we had the wind at S.E. and E.S.E., and fine promising  weather, we came all into the first proposal, and resolved for the coast  of Africa; nor were we long in disputing as to our coasting the island  which we were upon, for we were now upon the wrong side of the island  for the voyage we intended; so we stood away to the north, and, having  rounded the cape, we hauled away southward, under the lee of the island,  thinking to reach the west point of land, which, as I observed before,  runs out so far towards the coast of Africa, as would have shortened our  run almost 100 leagues. But when we had sailed about thirty leagues, we  found the winds variable under the shore, and right against us, so we  concluded to stand over directly, for then we had the wind fair, and our  vessel was but very ill fated to lie near the wind, or any way indeed  but just before it.    Having resolved upon it, therefore, we put into the shore to furnish  ourselves again with fresh water and other provisions, and about the  latter end of March, with more courage than discretion, more resolution  than judgment, we launched for the main coast of Africa.    As for me, I had no anxieties about it, so that we had but a view of  reaching some land or other, I "]]]
