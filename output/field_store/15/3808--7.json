His fellow countrymen could not condone the monstrous  offense of depicting therein as the pliant mediator of his perverted  sensuousness their beloved actress. And they have not yet forgiven him,  nor are they likely to forgive him.    After D'Annunzio had established a reputation as a neoromanticist with a  classical tendency he turned to drama, and the year 1897 marked his  advent into that field. His first efforts, three one-act parables--\"The  Foolish Virgins and the Wise Virgins,\" \"The Rich Man and Poor Lazarus,\"  and \"The Prodigal Son\"--were published in the _Mattino_ of Naples, a  newspaper controlled by the husband of his friend and fellow writer,  Matilde Serao. They are noteworthy merely to show the way in which a  sensuous pagan can transform simple characters into decadent, perverted  proselyters of pleasure. It was not until he wrote \"The Dream of a  Spring Morning\" and \"The Dream of an Autumn Sunset\" that he displayed  the same measure of lascivious imagery and capacity for description of  the perverse manifestations of eroticism that he revealed in his  romances. These were revealed in lines that truly may be said to be  masterpieces of lyric beauty, and when the Mad Woman of the first and  the Messalina of the second were interpreted by Eleanora Duse the  musical sound of the words and the emotional force of the sentiment  gained a quality of importance and grandeur which enhanced their  inherent qualities.    In \"La Citta Morta,\" his most successful drama, he returned to his  favorite topic, incest. Though his purpose in writing it, the most  successful of all his dramas, was to revive in form, structure, and  unity the Greek drama, it gave him an opportunity to display his  knowledge of the classics and archaeology. The philosophy and mysticism  of the play he got from Maeterlinck. Its theme is lust and crime. Lust  is portrayed in almost every conceivable form of perversion, in poetic  thoughts and graceful diction, especially in the delineation of  Leonardo, the explorer, who lusts for his sister. The dreamy, meditative  languor of the dramatis personae, their insensitiveness to every form of  ethical conformation, their perversion of every form of moral  relationship, constitute an atmosphere that the northerner does not  breath pleasurably. It was thoroughly purged before it was put on the  boards in this country.    His next play, \"La Gioconda,\" is an exposition of the exemption which  D'Annunzio thinks the artist of his own superman caliber should have  from conforming to the laws of estate or custom. The contention is a  simple one. He should do anything that he pleases--which means give  himself over to the pleasure of the senses and the appetites until the  indulgence is followed by satiety and thus his progress toward  perfection through gratification of desires will be accomplished. After  satiety comes disgust, and then a period of dementia, but this is merely  the prelude to another fling of erotic fury in his conformation to the  doctrine of purification through pleasure.    The hero is a psychopathic individual, sensitive, aboulic, distractible,  impressionable, impulsive, vacillating, and suicidal. He is married to a  woman who apparently has every beauty of soul and body that a woman can  have. But, alas, she is virtuous! She has not the key to the  jewel-casket of his genius. That is possessed by his model Gioconda  Dianti, the source of all his inspirations. One quiver of her eyelid  causes his soul to dissolve like sugar in water, while two make him feel  that he is lord of the universe.    The tragedy of the play is the permanent mutilation of the wife's hands,  the only somatic feature that has \"appealed\" to the artist. She attempts  to save his masterpiece which the model pushes over in temper on being  told falsely that she is to be banished. Her mutilated hands serve to  remind her the rest of her life that virtue is its own reward.    The two dramas of D'Annunzio which are best known to the  English-speaking public are \"La Figlia d'Jorio\" and \"Francesca di  Rimini.\" \"The Daughter of Jorio\" is a tragedy laid in the mountains of  Abruzzi. D'Annunzio knows the customs, habits, and traditions of the  shepherds and mountaineers, their superstitions and emotions, as he  knows art, archaeology, and eroticism. The first act is a description of  the betrothal of the son of a brutal shepherd to a simple girl with whom  he is not particularly in love. At the ceremony of betrothal the  daughter of Jorio, who is suspected to have evil powers, claims  protection from certain shepherds who had designs upon her. The first  impulse of the joyous party was to cast her out, but when the betrothed  young man was about to do so he saw behind her his lustful desire  presented to his eyes in the guise of an angel, which made him hesitate,  and the daughter of Jorio was allowed to remain. In the next act he is  seen as her lover. He quarrels about her with his father and kills him.  The parricide's punishment is to be sewed into a sack with a dog, a  cock, a viper, and a monkey and cast into the sea. The daughter of Jorio  comes to the rescue and convinces the people that she is the real  criminal. Eros is unconquerable.    In \"Francesca di Rimini,\" a historical play filled with erudite  archaeological details, he displays a knowledge of the thirteenth century  and of the customs of the time which has never been excelled save by  historical writers. It is a picture of war and bloodshed, of treachery  and accusation. The central theme is the love of Francesca and Paolo.  They may be taken as the typical human beings of the thirteenth-century  Italy, fond of luxury and beautiful things but savage in their  reactions. Perhaps Francesca is one of the best feminine figures that  D'Annunzio has ever drawn.    In 1904 there appeared two volumes entitled \"Praises of the Sky, the  Sea, the Earth and of Heroes.\" After that period his tragedies, \"The  Light under the Bushel,\" \"The Ship,\" \"Fedra,\" and \"The Mystery of San  Sebastian\" appeared in French, and soon he adopted France as his home,  having previously published a spiritual autobiography of eight thousand  four hundred lines entitled \"Laus Vitae,\" in which he summarizes the  motives of his past and lays the basis of his new inspiration.    D'Annunzio's war poems have all been inspired with the belief that  Italy's future lies on the sea. It is much to be regretted that they  have not yet been collected into a single volume. When it is done he  will not unlikely be recognized as the most legitimate of Pindar's  descendants. Undoubtedly he will want them to be the conspicuous,  permanent wreath on his tomb. The Libyan War inspired him to the  production of his noblest war poetry, \"Canzoni della Gesta d'Oltremare\"  (\"Songs of Achievements across the Sea\").    In the \"Canzoni di Mario Bianco\" he foresaw the beginning of a new era  for Italy, and he forecast the aspirations and promises of the third  Italy. His \"Canzone del Quarnaro\" describes the raid of the three  Italian torpedo-boats on the Buccari, a few miles to the southeast of  Fiume. It is short and forceful. The introductory \"beffa\" describes the  raid in detail. D'Annunzio is inordinately fond of using Christian  imagery, and he reverts to it here in the distribution of his little  tricolor flags, which has a mystic import. \"It is a true eucharistic  sacrament, the closest and most complete communion of the spirit with  beautiful Italy. There is no need of consecrating words; the tricolor  wafer was converted through our faith into the living beauty of our  country. We are purified, we are sundered from the shore and from our  daily habits, separated from the land and all vulgar cares, from our  homes and from all useless idleness, from profane love and all base  desires; we are immune from the thought of return.\"    The \"Cantico per l'ottava della Vittoria\" is a wish fulfilment for him.  As the boat enters the Quarnaro and runs up the coast of Istria it is,  for D'Annunzio, the guarantor of the treaty of London, and he sees all  the cities and islands of this coast restored to Italy, and these cities  and all the places hallowed by the war join in the paean of triumph.    In \"Songs of Achievements across the Sea\" D'Annunzio established an  incontestable claim to be the great inspiring poet, even the prophet, of  his generation in Italy, and he produced work which has not been  surpassed, but he was still the poet only, singer of the deeds of  others, in which he had no share himself. The contrast between his  pretensions and his achievements made the affectations of his early  years appear ridiculous to many people, and tended to obscure the true  value of his work. He was still seeking and the years that followed in  Paris showed that he had discovered no new world to explore, but when  Italy joined the Allies he suddenly found himself. All the brooding  sense of incomplete achievement of other days vanished in a moment. The  speeches and addresses that he delivered between May 4 and 25, 1915,  showed that he had been preparing for what he knew would be \"The Day\"  for him.    It was widely believed in Italy in 1917 and 1918 that on the evening of  May 4, 1915, when D'Annunzio addressed a meeting at Quarto to  commemorate an anniversary of Garibaldi's departure with his faithful  thousand to deliver Sicily and Naples from the Bourbon yoke, and a few  days later when he addressed them in the Costanzi Theatre in Rome and  then went with the enormous crowd to ring the bell of the Campidoglio,  the signal was given for the declaration of war against Austria and  Germany.    The last books of D'Annunzio, illustrating his new attitude toward life,  are \"La Leda senza-cigno\" (\"Leda without the Swan\"), \"Per la piu grande  Italia\" (\"For Greater Italy\"), \"La Beffa di Buccari\" (\"Buccari's Joke\"),  \"La Riscossa\" (\"The Rescue\"), \"Bestetti e Tuminelli\" (\"Italy and  Death\"), \"Contro Uno "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#11)"],[1,"that Aldonza had  discovered his love for Mayorica, and he began to think of using his  eternal arithmetical argument; he remembered, however, the little good  it had done him with Mayorica, and recognised that Aldonza was not then  in a condition to listen to reason. He thought, therefore, that the best  thing he could do would be to return to the castle, which he did,  cursing the unreasonableness of women, and swearing by all the saints in  heaven that, in future, he would have nothing to do with any of them as  long as he lived, even if a war took place in which so many men should  be killed, that there would be a hundred women left for every man that  survived.    Let us return with him to the Castle of Vivar and discover who were  those that we saw arriving there, and what was taking place in it, even  though the reader has most likely guessed that they were Diego Lainez  and his friends and servants, who had set out from Leon only a short  time after Rodrigo.    It was pitiable to see the state of affliction into which Teresa was  thrown when she saw her husband, whom she, full of love and tenderness,  ran to receive and clasp in her arms. The honoured Diego Lainez, though  he knew his wife would be deeply pained, did not conceal from her the  affront he had received, for it was a matter of necessity for him to  unbosom himself to some beloved being, who would help him to support  such a trial. Teresa Nu[~n]a, although the most tender and sensible of  women, was endowed with great strength of character to bear  tribulations; she was one of those beings whose presence and words  strengthen the weakest, and infuse confidence and hope into those who  have almost lost them. Thus it was that she succeeded in consoling Diego  to a considerable extent, particularly when she repeated the words which  Rodrigo used when expressing his determination that no insult to his  house should go unavenged. At that moment Diego conceived the idea of  finding out for himself what he might hope for from his son.    Scarcely had Rodrigo risen from his bed, when he was informed that his  father had returned to the castle; he hurried to visit him, and entered  Diego's chamber a very short time after Teresa had quitted it.    \"Father and lord, embrace me,\" he said, without noticing the affliction  which was clearly stamped on the features of the old man. His father  clasped him to his breast, and taking his hand, pressed it between his  with such force that little more would have disjointed the fingers, for  it seemed that Diego, with the strength of his will, had concentrated in  the hand with which he squeezed that of his son all the power that the  remainder of the muscles of his body retained.    The youth started back, trying to disengage his hand from the grip of  his father; pain coloured his cheeks and injected his eyes with blood.    \"Let go, father,\" he cried out, \"let go. Anger of God! if you were not  my father, you should pay for that squeeze you have given me.\"    The old man let loose the hand of the youth, and pressing him again to  his breast, said, weeping, not indeed with despair but with joy--    \"Son of my soul! that indignation was the comfort which your father  needed. Use that fiery spirit in avenging my honour, which is lost if  your arm does not save it.\"    \"Justice of God!\" cried Rodrigo, rising erect like a viper disturbed by  a wayfarer. \"Who is the traitor who has dared to attack your  honour--which is mine also? Tell me, father, for neither you nor I can  live, if the honour is dead, which no person till now has ever dared to  stain. Who, who is the coward that has affronted you?\"    \"My son, the Count of Gormaz has struck me on the face with his hand,  has covered my cheek with blood in the sight of the king and the  grandees of Leon\"--    And sobs smothered the voice of Diego.    \"Anger of God!\" exclaimed the brave youth, convulsed with anger even  greater than that which his father felt in his grief and old age. \"Do  not weep, father; for I swear to you that I shall cut off the hand which  has stained your visage, even though the cowardly felon should hide  himself in the bowels of the earth.\"    \"Go, my Rodrigo, go and challenge him to single combat. The king will  oppose no obstacles to it, for God, who cannot consent that an old man  should be outraged, and an honour thus stained which was gained by  fighting for the faith during four centuries, will put valour in your  heart and strength in your arm. Public was the offence, public also must  be the vengeance!\"    Speaking thus, Diego Lainez went to a large press that stood in the  chamber in which they were, and contained various kinds of arms. He took  down a sword and handed it to Rodrigo, with these words--    \"Take and bind on, my son, the sword of Mudarra; go and avenge with it  your father.\"    Rodrigo took the sword, kissed its cross-shaped hilt, and exclaimed--    \"Glorious sword, whose blade was tempered with the blood of Ruiz  Velasquez, be thou tempered again with that of the cowardly Count of  Gormaz, and bring honour to the arm of the son of Diego Lainez, as the  son of Gonzalo Gustios brought honour to thee!\"    The high price at which he valued his honour and the magnitude of the  insult he had received had caused the old grandee to exaggerate his  impotence to take vengeance on the count; it is true that he had  scarcely had an opportunity of proving the bravery of his son; however,  it was not so with regard to many other cavaliers of his family and of  his acquaintance. Thus it happened that, on the same day that he  acquired the certainty that his son would proceed to fight for the  honour of their house, a great number of his friends and retainers  presented themselves, offering the aid of their arms, of their riches,  and of their men-at-arms, in order to wash out the stain which he  grieved over. When Rodrigo, therefore, set out for Leon, having received  the blessing of his parents, he was followed by the good wishes of a  multitude of lords and cavaliers, and also by many of them in person,  who desired to be present at the reparation of the honour of De Vivar,  and even to defend it with the strength of their arms, in case the youth  should succumb in the combat.          CHAPTER VII    HOW RODRIGO FOUGHT WITH THE COUNT OF GORMAZ      The principal gate of the Alcazar led out on a broad square, bounded on  all sides by the magnificent mansions of the noblest families of the  city. Amongst them was that of the Count of Gormaz, who, although he had  a very large and strong castle in the country, with appointments worthy  of a king, resided usually in the Court city, since death had deprived  him of his wife at Gormaz.    Don Gome had loved his wife as Diego Lainez did his, for she had been  equally worthy of being loved. Whilst he enjoyed her affection and  caresses, ambition had never come to disturb his happiness, and he cared  but little for the Court, at which he was scarcely ever seen. However,  from the time he fixed his residence in Leon, whether it was that the  death of his dear companion had left a void in his soul, which had to be  filled up in some way, or whether it was that the glitter of a Court  life had deteriorated and darkened his heart, formerly free from evil  passions, it is certain that he became entirely changed. Envy  overmastered him, as a consequence of a boundless ambition for honours  and riches, which indeed he had no need of, for the count was of very  noble origin, and his family one of the richest of Castile. He certainly  loved his daughter, and was loved by her; it is also certain that Ximena  had united in herself sufficient beauty, discretion, and other good  qualities to make her the pride and glory of her father; all this,  however, was not sufficient for Don Gome, and his daughter filled but a  small portion of the void left in his heart by the death of his wife.  There are in men certain physiological phenomena which do not admit of  satisfactory explanation; in the case of the Count of Gormaz these were  very numerous.    Let us leave, however, this digression, and see what was taking place in  the palace of the count. In one of the apartments, which overlooked the  square of the Alcazar, was the sweet, the beautiful, the loving Ximena,  reclining on a couch, and drying up with her handkerchief the abundant  tears which flowed from her eyes. She was thinking deeply, and her  meditations must have been tortures to her soul, to judge from the agony  which could easily be seen on her countenance. Not far from her, Lambra  was occupied, much less with the work which lay upon her lap, than with  drying up the tears which the grief of her mistress caused her to shed.    The honoured due[~n]a deserves that we should say a few words about her,  for the part which a due[~n]a performed with regard to a young girl was not  an insignificant one, especially when the maiden is in love and has lost  her mother. Lambra was one of those women whose case would almost give  one a right to speak strongly against nature, if nature were not the  work of God--of God who has a heaven, with which to compensate people  for the privations which they have to bear on earth. She was one of  those women to whom nature had given a superabundance of love and, at  the same time, had denied them the privilege of lavishing it on men,  for, as far as she was concerned, her countenance was cast in such a  mould that the more she might desire to approach men, the more would  they fly from her. Women of this kind devote their love to the first  being that crosses their path, for if they did not do so their hearts  would burst with the affection which fills them. In this condition was  Lambra: Ximena was the being who had crossed her path and on whom she  had poured out all the love of her heart; she was present at her birth,  and had witnessed her physical and moral development from day to day  without"]]]
