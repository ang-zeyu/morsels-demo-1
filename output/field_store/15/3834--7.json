CHAPTER XX         Duke Guidobaldo restored--The election of Julius II.--The       fall of Cesare Borgia--The Duke's fortunate position--Is       made Knight of the Garter--The Pope visits Urbino.      Whilst Valentino and his partizans thus had their hands full at Rome,  Romagna and his recent conquests threw off his rule. His officers had  concealed the first news of the tragedy at the Vatican, but, on the  22nd of August, authentic intelligence of the death of Alexander and  the illness of his son having reached Urbino, through some emissaries  of Guidobaldo who announced that the moment for action had arrived,  the people ran to arms. The governor fled to Cesena; his lieutenant  was slain in the tumult; the siege of S. Leo was raised; and in one  day the entire duchy, except one unimportant castle, returned to its  lawful sovereign.[*12]    [Footnote *12: During the Duke's absence an interesting  correspondence passed between Isabella d'Este and Cardinal Ippolito  d'Este in Rome concerning a Venus and a Cupid of the Duke's. The  Venus was a torso and antique, but the Cupid was the work of  Michelangelo. Cf. GAYE, _Carteggio d'Artisti_, vol. II.,  p. 53; ALVISI, _Cesare Borgia_, p. 537; LUZIO, in _Arch. St. Lombardo_  (1886), and JULIA CARTWRIGHT, _Isabella d'Este_ (Murray, 1903), vol. I.,  p. 230 _et seq._]    On hearing that the Pope and Cesare were both ill, the Duke of Urbino  hastily quitted Venice, his honourable and secure retreat, leaving  behind, in the words of Bembo, \"a high reputation for superhuman  genius, for admirable acquirements, for singular discretion.\" As  a parting favour, that republic advanced him 3000 or 4000 ducats,  towards the expenses of his restoration. He wrote desiring his  nephew Fregoso to send over a detachment from S. Leo, to maintain  order in his capital, and himself following upon the steps of his  messenger, reached that fortress on the 27th of August. Next day he  proceeded to Urbino, where, Castiglione tells us, \"he was met by  swarms of children bearing olive-boughs, and hailing his auspicious  arrival; by aged sires tottering under their years, and weeping for  joy; by men and women; by mothers with their babes; by crowds of  every age and sex; nay, the very stones seemed to exult and leap.\"  Women of all ranks flocked in from the adjacent townships, with  tambourines played before them, to see their sovereign, and touch his  hand; whilst popular fury spent itself upon the usurper's armorial  ensigns, which had been painted in fresco over the city gates a few  months before by Timoteo Vite, at the rate of from one to four ducats  each.[*13]    [Footnote *13: Cf. MADIAI, _Diario delle Cose di Urbino_, in  _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 444.]    The example of Urbino was quickly followed by Sinigaglia, Pesaro,  and the other principalities; and by October, a confederacy for  their common maintenance and defence, under oaths and a mutual bond  of 10,000 ducats, was organised by these three states, along with  Camerino, Perugia, Piombino, Citta di Castello, and Rimini, in all  which the exiled seigneurs had resumed their ascendancy.    It was a condition of this league, that no step or engagement should  be taken by any of the parties without the sanction of Guidobaldo,  who a month before had strengthened his position by accepting service  from the Venetians. The Signory engaged to protect him during life in  his state, against all attacks, and to pay him annually 20,000 scudi,  he maintaining for them a hundred men-at-arms, and a hundred and  fifty light cavalry, besides placing at their disposal, for instant  service, two thousand foot. These were forthwith sent to ravage the  neighbourhood of Cesena, which remained faithful to Valentino, and  thereafter, co-operating with other forces of the new league under  Ottaviano Fregoso, they attacked in succession such citadels and  castles as were held for the usurper.    The star of Borgia seemed once more in the ascendant. Early  in October Cesare, now able to bestride a mule, returned to  Rome, attended by a hundred and fifty men-at-arms and a hundred  halberdiers, where he patched up a reconciliation with the Orsini  faction, then dominant. From motives which it would now be difficult  to trace, the new Pontiff received him with favour, and named  him captain-general of the Church. But in this crisis of his  destiny he displayed no elevation of character. Disconcerted by  the embarrassment of his position, perhaps by the admonitions of  conscience, uncertain where to repose confidence or look for support,  he quickly repented having trusted himself in the city, and longed  to escape from its incensed populace and exasperated factions to  the shelter of his strongholds in Romagna. Humbling himself before  Gian-Giordano Orsini, the enemy of his race, he obtained a promise of  his escort across the Campagna; but perceiving, ere he had cleared  the gate, that he was in the hands of men by whom old grudges were  not forgotten, he fled in panic to the Vatican. There he crouched  beneath the doubtful favour of Pius, and the waning influence of the  Spanish cardinals, who vainly sought to protect his property from  pillage, and to expedite his escape in disguise, until the Holy See  was again vacated by its short-lived occupant.[14]    [Footnote 14: In the communal archives of Perugia, there is a brief  addressed to the authorities of that town by Pius III., dated 17th of  October, 1503, \"before his coronation,\" but in fact the day preceding  his death, which must have been obtained by the influence of Cesare,  and which speaks a language very different from what his Holiness  would probably have adopted had his life been spared. Its object  was to prohibit certain \"conventicles\" which Gianpaolo Baglioni  was reported to be holding in Perugia, for the purpose of plotting  against the person of the Duke of Valenza and Romagna, and to desire  that he be charged to avoid all courses tending to the prejudice of  Borgia.]    Thus was that make-shift policy defeated by which the late conclave  had sought time for strengthening their interests and maturing their  intrigues: a new election was at hand ere its elements had subsided  from their recent turmoil. The Orsini were paramount in the city,  the Spaniards in the Sacred College. A struggle ensued whether the  former should obtain an order for Valentino's departure, or should  themselves withdraw from Rome before the conclave was closed. Victory  declared for the Iberian cardinals, by aid of Ascanio Sforza, who  sought to conciliate their suffrages for himself. Once again the  bantling of fortune had the game in his hand, again to play it  away. Holding, as was supposed, at his absolute disposal the votes  of the Borgian cardinals, he was courted by all who aspired to the  tiara; and in hopes of retrieving his affairs by the election of a  friendly pope, he took measures for throwing his whole influence  into the scale of Amboise, Cardinal of Rouen, as organ of the French  party. But that strong will and indomitable resolution which had  triumphantly carried him through many crimes were now wanting. From  day to day his plans faltered and his policy wavered; finally his  efforts failed. Men were wearied of the feeble counsels, the selfish  epicureanism, the public scandals of recent pontiffs. To rescue  the Church from utter degradation, a very different category of  qualifications was required, and even the electors felt that they  must find a pope in all respects the reverse of Alexander.    There was no member of the Sacred College whom Valentino had such  reason to fear and hate, none of whose domineering ambition the  Consistory stood in such awe, as Giulio della Rovere. Yet did his  master-spirit overcome all opposition. On the day preceding the  conclave he effected a reconciliation with the Spaniards, and his  ancient rival Ascanio Sforza sought his friendship. As he rode to  enter upon its duties, the cortege of attendant prelates equalled  that which usually swelled the train of an elected pope. Before  the door was closed, bets of eighty-two to a hundred were made on  his success, one hundred to six being offered against any other  candidate. It was, therefore, scarcely matter of surprise that within  an hour or two thereafter Julius II. was chosen by acclamation,  without a scrutiny.[15]    [Footnote 15: Our information is in many respects deficient regarding  the numerous and complicated events occurring at Rome between the  poisoning of Alexander and the final departure of his son Cesare,  and authorities are frequently irreconcileable. We are indebted to  Sanuto's Diary for many unedited particulars, especially of the papal  elections, but the most distinct account of these transactions, and  on the whole trustworthy, which we have met with, is given by Masse.]    At the last moment, Borgia's adherents, finding opposition vain,  thought it best to lay the new occupant of St. Peter's chair under  the obligation of their suffrages, a policy which Machiavelli had  justly condemned as the greatest blunder ever committed by their  leader. Some historians allege that their support was gained by an  offer of Julius to maintain him in his dignities and investitures,  betrothing his infant daughter to his own nephew the young Lord  Prefect. Unlikely as this may seem, there "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],[0,"The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#11)"],[1,"the theory  that an angler must be born and then made.  I have always held the same  to be true of the bookseller.  There are many, too many, charlatans in  the trade; the simon-pure bookseller enters upon and conducts  bookselling not merely as a trade and for the purpose of amassing  riches, but because he loves books and because he has pleasure in  diffusing their gracious influences.    Judge Methuen tells me that it is no longer the fashion to refer to  persons or things as being \"simon-pure\"; the fashion, as he says,  passed out some years ago when a writer in a German paper \"was led into  an amusing blunder by an English review.  The reviewer, having occasion  to draw a distinction between George and Robert Cruikshank, spoke of  the former as the real Simon Pure.  The German, not understanding the  allusion, gravely told his readers that George Cruikshank was a  pseudonym, the author's real name being Simon Pure.\"    This incident is given in Henry B. Wheatley's \"Literary Blunders,\" a  very charming book, but one that could have been made more interesting  to me had it recorded the curious blunder which Frederick Saunders  makes in his \"Story of Some Famous Books.\"  On page 169 we find this  information:  \"Among earlier American bards we instance Dana, whose  imaginative poem 'The Culprit Fay,' so replete with poetic beauty, is a  fairy tale of the highlands of the Hudson.  The origin of the poem is  traced to a conversation with Cooper, the novelist, and Fitz-Greene  Halleck, the poet, who, speaking of the Scottish streams and their  legendary associations, insisted that the American rivers were not  susceptible of like poetic treatment.  Dana thought otherwise, and to  make his position good produced three days after this poem.\"    It may be that Saunders wrote the name Drake, for it was James Rodman  Drake who did \"The Culprit Fay.\"  Perhaps it was the printer's fault  that the poem is accredited to Dana.  Perhaps Mr. Saunders writes so  legible a hand that the printers are careless with his manuscript.    \"There is,\" says Wheatley, \"there is a popular notion among authors  that it is not wise to write a clear hand.  Menage was one of the first  to express it.  He wrote:  'If  you desire that no mistake shall appear  in the works which you publish, never send well-written copy to the  printer, for in that case the manuscript is given to young apprentices,  who make a thousand errors; while, on the other hand, that which is  difficult to read is dealt with by the master-printers.'\"    The most distressing blunder I ever read in print was made at the time  of the burial of the famous antiquary and litterateur, John Payne  Collier.  In the London newspapers of Sept. 21, 1883, it was reported  that \"the remains of the late Mr. John Payne Collier were interred  yesterday in Bray churchyard, near Maidenhead, in the presence of a  large number of spectators.\" Thereupon the Eastern daily press  published the following remarkable perversion:  \"The Bray Colliery  Disaster.  The remains of the late John Payne, collier, were interred  yesterday afternoon in the Bray churchyard in the presence of a large  number of friends and spectators.\"    Far be it from the book-lover and the book-collector to rail at  blunders, for not unfrequently these very blunders make books valuable.  Who cares for a Pine's Horace that does not contain the \"potest\" error?  The genuine first edition of Hawthorne's \"Scarlet Letter\" is to be  determined by the presence of a certain typographical slip in the  introduction.  The first edition of the English Scriptures printed in  Ireland (1716) is much desired by collectors, and simply because of an  error. Isaiah bids us \"sin no more,\" but the Belfast printer, by some  means or another, transposed the letters in such wise as to make the  injunction read \"sin on more.\"    The so-called Wicked Bible is a book that is seldom met with, and,  therefore, in great demand.  It was printed in the time of Charles I.,  and it is notorious because it omits the adverb \"not\" in its version of  the seventh commandment; the printers were fined a large sum for this  gross error.  Six copies of the Wicked Bible are known to be in  existence.  At one time the late James Lenox had two copies; in his  interesting memoirs Henry Stevens tells how he picked up one copy in  Paris for fifty guineas.    Rabelais' printer got the satirical doctor  into deep water for  printing asne for ame; the council of the Sorbonne took the matter up  and asked Francis I. to prosecute Rabelais for heresy; this the king  declined to do, and Rabelais proceeded forthwith to torment the council  for having founded a charge of heresy upon a printer's blunder.    Once upon a time the Foulis printing establishment at Glasgow  determined to print a perfect Horace; accordingly the proof sheets were  hung up at the gates of the university, and a sum of money was paid for  every error detected.    Notwithstanding these precautions the edition had six uncorrected  errors in it when it was finally published.  Disraeli says that the  so-called Pearl Bible had six thousand errata!  The works of Picus of  Mirandula, Strasburg, 1507, gave a list of errata covering fifteen  folio pages, and a worse case is that of \"Missae ac Missalis Anatomia\"  (1561), a volume of one hundred and seventy-two pages, fifteen of which  are devoted to the errata.  The author of the Missae felt so deeply  aggrieved by this array of blunders that he made a public explanation  to the effect that the devil himself stole the manuscript, tampered  with it, and then actually compelled the printer to misread it.    I am not sure that this ingenious explanation did not give origin to  the term of \"printer's devil.\"         It is frightful to think        What nonsense sometimes     They make of one's sense        And, what's worse, of one's rhymes.       It was only last week,        In my ode upon spring,     Which I meant to have made        A most beautiful thing,       When I talked of the dewdrops        From freshly blown roses,     The nasty things made it        From freshly blown noses.      We can fancy Richard Porson's rage (for Porson was of violent temper)  when, having written the statement that \"the crowd rent the air with  their shouts,\" his printer made the line read \"the crowd rent the air  with their snouts.\"  However, this error was a natural one, since it  occurs in the \"Catechism  of the Swinish Multitude.\"  Royalty only are  privileged when it comes to the matter of blundering.  When Louis XIV.  was a boy he one day spoke of \"un carosse\"; he should have said \"une  carosse,\" but he was king, and having changed the gender of carosse the  change was accepted, and unto this day carosse is masculine.    That errors should occur in newspapers is not remarkable, for much of  the work in a newspaper office is done hastily.  Yet some of these  errors are very amusing.  I remember to have read in a Berlin newspaper  a number of years ago that \"Prince Bismarck is trying to keep up honest  and straightforward relations with all the girls\" (madchen).    This statement seemed incomprehensible until it transpired that the  word \"madchen\" was in this instance a misprint for \"machten,\" a word  meaning all the European powers.        X    WHEN FANCHONETTE BEWITCHED ME    The garden in which I am straying has so many diversions to catch my  eye, to engage my attention and to inspire reminiscence that I find it  hard to treat of its beauties methodically.  I find myself wandering up  and down, hither and thither, in so irresponsible a fashion that I  marvel you have not abandoned me as the most irrational of madmen.    Yet how could it be otherwise?  All around me I see those things that  draw me from the pathway I set out to pursue: like a heedless butterfly  I flit from this sweet unto that, glorying and revelling in the  sunshine and the posies.  There is little that is selfish in a love  like this, and herein we have another reason why the passion for books  is beneficial.  He who loves women must and  should love some one woman  above the rest, and he has her to his keeping, which I esteem to be one  kind of selfishness.    But he who truly loves books loves all books alike, and not only this,  but it grieves him that all other men do not share with him this noble  passion.  Verily, this is the most unselfish of loves!    To return now to the matter of booksellers, I would fain impress you  with the excellences of the craft, for I know their virtues. My  association with them has covered so long a period and has been so  intimate that even in a vast multitude of people I have no difficulty  in determining who are the booksellers and who are not.    For, having to do with books, these men in due time come to resemble  their wares not only in appearance but also in conversation.  My  bookseller has dwelt so long in his corner with folios and quartos and  other antique tomes that he talks in black-letter and has the modest,  engaging look of a brown old stout binding, and to the delectation of  discriminating olfactories he exhaleth an odor of mildew and of tobacco  commingled, which is more grateful to the true bibliophile than all the  perfumes of Araby.    I have studied the craft so diligently that by merely clapping my eyes  upon a bookseller I can tell you with certainty what manner of books he  sells; but you must know that the ideal bookseller has no fads, being  equally proficient in and a lover of all spheres, departments,  branches, and lines of his art.  He is, moreover, of a benignant  nature, and he denies credit to none; yet, withal, he is righteously so  discriminating that he lets the poor scholar have for a paltry sum that  which the rich parvenu must pay dearly for.  He is courteous and  considerate where courtesy and consideration are most seemly.    Samuel Johnson once rolled into a London bookseller's shop to ask for  literary employment.  The"]]]
