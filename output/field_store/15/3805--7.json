No one paid a  great deal of attention to it, but suddenly for no apparent reason at  all one of the men on guard was jerked into the air feet upwards. He  gave a scream of fear, and an unearthly screech answered him. The guard,  with the exception of one man, turned tail and ran. One man stuck by his  gun and poured a stream of bullets into the crack. The retreating men  could hear the rattle of the gun for a few moments and then there was a  choking scream, followed by silence. When the officer of the day got  back with a patrol, there was a heavy smell of musk in the air, and a  good deal of blood was splashed around. The machine-guns were both  there, although one of them was twisted up until it looked like it had  been through an explosion.    \"The Officer commanding the company investigated the place, ordered all  men out of the cave, and communicated with the War Department. The  Secretary of War found it too tough a nut to crack and he asked for  help, so Bolton is sending me down there. Do you think, in view of this  yarn, that your experiments can wait?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The creases on Dr. Bird's high forehead had grown deeper and deeper as  Carnes had told his story, but now they suddenly disappeared, and he  jumped to his feet with a boyish grin.    \"How soon are we leaving?\" he asked.    \"In two hours, Doctor. A car is waiting for us downstairs and I have  reservations booked for both of us on the Southern to-night. I knew that  you were coming; in fact, the request for your services had been  approved before I came here to see you.\"    Dr. Bird rapidly divested himself of his laboratory smock and took his  coat and hat from a cupboard.    \"I hope you realize, Carnsey, old dear,\" he said as he followed the  operative out of the building, \"that I have a real fondness for your  worthless old carcass. I am leaving the results of two weeks of patient  work alone and unattended in order to keep you out of trouble, and I  know that it will be ruined when I get back. I wonder whether you are  worth it?\"    \"Bosh!\" retorted Carnes. \"I'm mighty glad to have you along, but you  needn't rub it in by pretending that it is affection for me that is  dragging you reluctantly into this mess. With an adventure like this  ahead of you, leg-irons and handcuffs wouldn't keep you away from  Mammoth Cave, whether I was going or not.\"    It was late afternoon before Dr. Bird and Carnes dismounted from the  special train which had carried them from Glasgow Junction to Mammoth  Cave. They introduced themselves to the major commanding the guard  battalion which had been ordered down to reinforce the single company  which had borne the first brunt of the affair, and then interviewed the  guards who had been routed by the unseen horror which was haunting the  famous cave. Nothing was learned which differed in any great degree from  the tale which Carnes had related to the doctor in Washington, except  that the officer of the day who had investigated the last attack failed  to entirely corroborate the smell of musk which had been reported by the  other observers.    \"It might have been musk, but to me it smelled differently,\" he said.  \"Were you ever near a rattlesnake den in the west?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird nodded.    \"Then you know the peculiar reptilian odor which such a place gives off.  Well, this smell was somewhat similar, although not the same by any  manner of means. It was musky all right, but it was more snake than musk  to me. I rather like musk, but this smell gave me the horrors.\"    \"Did you hear any noises?\"    \"None at all. The men describe some rather peculiar noises and Sergeant  Jervis is an old file and pretty apt to get things straight, but they  may have been made by the men who were in trouble. I saw a man caught by  a boa in South America once, and the noises he made might very well have  been described in almost the same words as Jervis used.\"    \"Thanks, Lieutenant,\" replied the Doctor. \"I'll remember what you have  told me. Now I think that we'll go into the cave.\"    \"My orders are to allow no one to enter, Doctor.\"    \"I beg your pardon. Carnes, where is that letter from the Secretary of  War?\"    Carnes produced the document. The lieutenant examined it and excused  himself. He returned in a few moments with the commanding officer.    \"In the face of that letter, Dr. Bird,\" said the major, \"I have no  alternative to allowing you to enter the cave, but I will warn you that  it is at your own peril. I'll give you an escort, if you wish.\"    \"If Lieutenant Pearce will come with me as a guide, that will be all  that I need.\"    The lieutenant paled slightly, but threw back his shoulders.    \"Do you wish to start at once, sir?\" he asked.    \"In a few moments. What is the floor of the cave like where we are  going?\"    \"Quite wet and slimy, sir.\"    \"Very slippery?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"In that case before we go in we want to put on baseball shoes with  cleats on them, so that we can run if we have to. Can you get us  anything like that?\"    \"In a few moments, sir.\"    \"Good! As soon as we can get them we'll start. In the meantime, may I  look at that gun that was found?\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Browning machine-gun was laid before the doctor. He looked it over  critically and sniffed delicately at it. He took from his pocket a phial  of liquid, moistened a portion of the water-jacket of the weapon, and  then rubbed the moistened part briskly with his hand. He sniffed again.  He looked disappointed, and again examined the gun closely.    \"Carnes,\" he said at length, \"do you see anything on this gun that looks  like tooth marks?\"    \"Nothing, Doctor.\"    \"Neither do I. There are some marks here which might quite conceivably  be finger-prints of a forty-foot giant, and those two parallel grooves  look like the result of severe squeezing, but there are no tooth marks.  Strange. There is no persistent odor on the gun, which is also strange.  Well, there's no use in theorizing: we are confronted by a condition and  not a theory, as someone once said. Let's put on those baseball shoes  and see what we can find out.\"    Dr. Bird led the way into the cave, Carnes and the lieutenant following  closely with electric torches. In each hand Dr. Bird carried a  phosphorus hand-grenade. No other weapons were visible, although the  doctor knew that Carnes carried a caliber .45 automatic pistol strapped  under his left armpit. As they passed into the cave the lieutenant  stepped forward to lead the way.    \"I'm going first,\" said the doctor. \"Follow me and indicate the turns by  pressure on my shoulder. Don't speak after we have started, and be ready  for instant flight. Let's go.\"    Forward into the interior of the cave they made their way. The iron  cleats of the baseball shoes rang on the floor and the noise echoed back  and forth between the walls, dying out in little eerie whispers of sound  that made Carnes' hair rise. Ever forward they pressed, the lieutenant  guiding the doctor by silent pressure on his shoulder and Carnes  following closely. For half a mile they went on until a restrainable  pressure brought the doctor to a halt. The lieutenant pointed silently  toward a crack in the wall before them. Carnes started forward to  examine it, but a warning gesture from the doctor stopped him.           *       *       *       *       *    Slowly, an inch at a time, the doctor crept forward, hand-grenades in  readiness. Presently he reached the crack and, shifting one of the  grenades into his pocket, he drew forth an electric torch and sent a  beam of light through the crack into the dark interior of the earth.    For a moment he stood thus, and then suddenly snapped off his torch and  straightened up in an attitude of listening. The straining ears of  Carnes and Lieutenant Pearce could hear a faint slithering noise coming  toward them, not from the direction of the crack, but from the interior  of the cave. Simultaneously a faint, musky, reptilian odor became  apparent.    \"Run!\" shouted the doctor. \"Run like hell! It's loose in the cave!\"    The lieutenant turned and fled at top speed toward the distant entrance  to the cave, Carnes at his heels. Dr. Bird paused for an instant,  straining his ears, and then threw a grenade. A blinding flash came from  the point where the missile struck and a white cloud rose in the air.  The doctor turned and fled after his companions. Not for nothing had Dr.  Bird been an athlete of note in his college days. Despite the best  efforts of his companions, who were literally running for their lives,  he soon caught up with them. As he did so a weird, blood-curdling  screech rose from the darkness behind them. Higher and higher in pitch  the note rose until it ended suddenly in a gurgling grunt, as though the  breath which uttered it had been suddenly cut off. The slithering,  rustling noise became louder on their trail.    \"Faster!\" gasped the doctor, as he put his hand on Carnes' shoulder and  pushed him forward.           *       *       *       *       *    The noise of pursuit gained slightly on them, and a sound as of intense  breathing became audible. Dr. Bird paused and turned and faced the  oncoming horror. His electric torch revealed nothing, but he listened  for a moment, and then threw his second grenade. Keenly he watched its  flight. It flew through the air for thirty yards and then struck an  invisible obstruction and bounded toward the ground. Before it struck  the downward motion ceased, and it rose in the air. As it rose it burst  with a sharp report, and a wild scream of pain filled the cavern with a  deafening roar. The doctor fled again after his companions.    By the time he overtook them the entrance of the cave loomed before  them. With sobs of relief they burst out into the open. The guards  sprang forward with raised rifles, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41533"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 6 (of 6) (#11)"],[1,"Uberti,  Florentines, d. 1606, aged 84. _Ridolfi._ iii. 171, 222.    ---- Orazio, his son, d. young. _Pozzo._ His altar-piece at S.
