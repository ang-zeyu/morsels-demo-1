Tacitus was one of the  most popular Roman authors of his time, and yet he only lives to us in  fragments, notwithstanding the fact that thousands upon thousands of  copies of his 'History' were disseminated throughout the empire.  Every  public library in Rome was compelled to have at least one copy, and no  fewer than ten transcriptions were made every year at the charge of the  State.  Plutarch wrote fourteen biographies that are missing now, and of  251 books quoted by him more than eighty are absolutely unknown.  The  Emperor Claudius wrote a 'History of the Etruscans,' which from the very  nature of the case must have had a wide circulation; Julius Caesar, a  slashing criticism of Cato's life and acts; Lucullus, a history of the  Marsi.  All these have vanished.  Of the forty plays of Aristophanes but  eleven remain.  Menander is unknown except by name, and AEschylus is in  rags.  Porphyry's diatribe against the Christians, the most important  book of its kind that any Christian could have at his command, has  vanished, and in all likelihood will never be restored.    Nor need we go to ancient Greece or Rome for such instances.  Several  poems by Shelley have completely disappeared already, and some of  Byron's have been, more than once, at their last gasp.  Old English  ballads and songs have been 'lost' by hundreds at a time, and nearly all  the records dealing with the private life of Oliver Cromwell are  missing.  The story of Carlyle's 'Squire Papers' is a characteristic  one, and distinctly to the point.  While that author was laboriously  collating the scraps of evidence relative to the great Protector that  had survived the honest but mistaken zeal of triumphing Royalists, he  received a letter from an unknown correspondent, who stated that he  possessed a mass of Parliamentary documents, among them the diary of an  ancestor, one Samuel Squire, a subaltern in the 'Stilton Troop' of  Ironsides.  The letter was accompanied by extracts from this diary and  other papers, and went on to say that the writer, who had been brought  up to regard Cromwell in the very worst possible light, and his own  ancestor with shame as the aider and abettor of an atrocious crime, was  undecided what to do with the originals. Several letters passed, and at  last Carlyle wrote to a friend living in the neighbourhood, asking him  to see his correspondent, and persuade him of his undoubted duty, which  was at least to submit documents of such great importance to  examination.    Unfortunately, the friend was absent, and by the time he returned the  papers had been destroyed. They may, of course, have had no existence,  but Carlyle himself was of a contrary opinion, for later on he received  a heavy packet containing copies of thirty-five letters of Oliver  Cromwell, written in a style apparently contemporary, and referring to  incidents that no one who had not made a careful and exhaustive study of  his life and times, and who was not thoroughly conversant with all the  available material, would have been in the least able to reproduce.    The records were destroyed because, as the owner said, he felt that, one  way or another, the manuscripts would be got from him and made public,  and 'what could that amount to but a new Guy Fawkes cellar and infernal  machine to explode the cathedral city where he lived, and all its  coteries, and almost dissolve Nature for the time being?'  Either this  man was a learned forger or a singularly narrow-minded and obstinate  type of destroyer whose ravages can be traced through the centuries, and  whose example will never cease to be followed so long as paper remains  unable to resist the assaults of the bigot and the outrages of the Goth.    That will be ever, and hence it is that in all things literary  preservation is the greatest of the virtues.  What part of a century's  product to preserve and what to destroy is a problem, not for us, but  for the century to come, and for many centuries after that.  In fact, it  is Time's problem, which Time alone can solve.                                        *CHAPTER V.*                       *SOME HUNTING-GROUNDS OF LONDON.*      At the present time there are, if the Post-Office Directory is to be  believed, about 450 booksellers in London; but in this computation are  included publishers, stationers, and even bookbinders--in fact, almost  everyone who has anything whatever to do with books--so that the figures  are by no means to be relied upon.  The number of booksellers who make a  speciality of second-hand volumes is very much less than 450, if we  include only those who follow a single business, namely, that of buying  and selling books, and very much greater if we add to the list the army  of general dealers who sell books occasionally, or as an adjunct to some  other occupation.    The real book-hunter does not follow the Directory, but his nose, which  frequently leads him into strange places where there are no recognised  booksellers, yet booksellers in plenty--a seeming paradox, which is  readily explained by the fact that there are multitudes of what may,  without offence, be called 'book-jobbers,' whose names are either not in  the Directory at all, or appear there under some other designation.    A man may buy up a roomful of furniture, taking the books of necessity;  or a houseful, and with the mass of goods and chattels perhaps hundreds  of volumes which are not thought good enough to be disposed of  separately, and are therefore cleared out at a nominal figure, and  retailed anywhere and everywhere as circumstance and opportunity  suggest.  Are these dealers, brokers, and what not, booksellers?  Heaven  save the mark, no! not in a specific sense; but they sell books,  notwithstanding, and their shops are, in very truth, recognised  hunting-grounds of the Metropolis.  There are literally hundreds of  them, and they are to be met with, as a rule, close together, where  rents are low and the footsteps of the income-tax fiend are unknown.    This is one description of bookseller, but there are several others: the  man with the barrow, for instance, who works at his trade all the week,  and comes out on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings in certain  localities, to do what bartering he can with casual passers-by.    To compare these classes with the recognised booksellers, some of whom  have an immense turnover, would, of course, be absurd; but they have  their uses, and instances are not wanting in which mightily successful  dealers have begun in this humble manner, and literally forced their way  up from the pavements of the East End or the Surrey side to more  pleasant places in the West.  High or low, rich or poor, their shops or  stalls are alike objects of extreme interest to thousands who have  learned enough to know that the best books are generally the cheapest.  Whatever the size of the premises they own, they contribute in their  several degrees to the wants of all classes of book-men, whose delight  it is to forage for themselves, and to seek that they may find.  The  lordly collector who pays by cheque may or may not be a book-hunter. If  not, he misses much of the pleasure that accompanies the tracking down,  step by step, of some coveted volume which is, perhaps, more or less  easily obtainable almost at any time in exchange for plenty of money,  but is rarely met with casually.    It is this tracking down, hunting which is the true book-lover's chief  delight, and, needless to say, his primary object is not to secure books  of great price for a nominal sum.  If it were, he would at the end of a  long life have few successes to report, for the search for rarities is  so thorough and systematic that hardly anything of substantial pecuniary  value can run the gauntlet all the way to the shop-board or the barrow.  The harvest has all been gathered long ago, and nothing is now left but  gleanings in fields already raked. The book-lover eliminates as far as  possible the question of value from his walks abroad, and leaves his  gold at home to be expended as opportunity arises in the auction-room,  where open competition holds the market in a virtual equipoise, or in  the shops of recognised dealers, who hold his commissions and are always  on the look-out for important works.  He is aware, however, that  intrinsically good books are to be met with continually in all sorts of  places, and it is these that he hopes to obtain, and from these that his  library is most often recruited.  Between one edition of some  interesting or instructive book and another there may be an immense  disparity in cost, but very little textual difference, or even none at  all.  In some cases the cheaper volume may be the more accurate of the  two, and may also contain additional matter, which renders it more  important and desirable from every point of view, except a sentimental  one.    It is the search for volumes of this kind, sound and honest, yet not  aristocratic, that has kept the bookstalls open for 300 years and more,  for, to be precise, we know that St. Paul's Churchyard and Fleet Street  were, in addition to other less known localities, much frequented by  book-men as far back as the reign of Henry VIII. In these districts  Cardinal Wolsey's agents kept a sharp look-out for copies of 'A  Supplicacyon for the Beggars,' which Simon Fyshe, 'a zealous man for the  reformation of abuses in the Church,' had boldly published and was  scattering abroad in the year 1524, and which seems to have had a  stealthy run for six years, for it was not until 1530 that it was openly  prohibited by proclamation.  Neither Fleet Street nor St Paul's  Churchyard is, however, a hunting-ground for book-men now.  The former  is wholly given up to newspapers and machinery, and the latter to  drapers and warehousemen, and there is no room anywhere for small  dealers in second-ha"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46303"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 6 (of 8) (#11)"],[1,"range and fired on them. A response from the British  remnant followed. There were presently only four of them, commanded by  Corporal Morden, who, Lieutenant Inglis being disabled, took his place.  Here, in the face of these terrible odds, the Corporal sent off Private  Miles to inform Colonel Evans of his plight. The messenger executed his  errand, and returned to assist his comrades. He was hit, but still  persisted in \"having a go at the enemy.\" Then Corporal Morden dropped  with a bullet through the brain. Miles, wet with his own  gore--fainting--supported himself against a tussock and continued to  direct the firing of his brother and Private Kerr. Eventually the Boers  made off, but not before Kerr had been killed by a parting shot. Finally  the relief party arrived, and carried the few remaining heroes back to  camp. Among the day's casualties were: Major H. T. de C. Hobbs, West  Yorkshire Regiment, killed; Second Lieutenant H. H. Smith, 1st Gloucester  Regiment, severely wounded; Lieutenant W. M. Inglis, 2nd Canadian Mounted  Infantry, severely wounded. The total casualties amounted to thirty-one.    The programme of surprise parties, trapping of small forces, and abuse of  the white flag, continued with little variety. Owing to the disposition  of the British troops to east of the railway, and the scarcity of  supplies and transport that militated against their mobility, the Boers  were temporarily in the ascendant. It was no easy matter to have and to  hold the arteries of the great army whose head was Pretoria, and yet to  guard the railway lines and send reinforcements at a moment's notice to  points menaced by the agile commandos of the enemy, and consequently  those who were responsible for the safety of the communications lived the  life of Damocles--without that personage's certainty of whence the fatal  blow might be expected!    The maintenance of the safety of the line from Kroonstad to Pretoria was  in the hands of General Smith-Dorrien, who placed at every post two  companies with two or more guns. He himself eternally perambulated the  line, now repairing, now mounting guns, now despatching patrols, in fact,  playing with almost superhuman energy and vigilance the game of fox and  geese--the fox De Wet, the geese the long tail of communications. In  spite, however, of the surprising energy of the General, the dog fox--the  wiliest reynard that ever challenged chase--redoubled his activities.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Lieutenant-Colonel A. Baird-Douglas was a militia officer whose first  appointment was dated October 1, 1881. His name is to be found among the  list of officers of the reserve, who have held commissions in the Hon.  Artillery Company of London, Militia, Yeomanry, or Volunteers. He had  been Major and Hon. Lieutenant-Colonel of the 3rd Battalion of the  Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders since March 1898; was attached to the 4th  (Militia) Battalion of the Derbyshire Regiment, which was embodied on the  4th of December 1899.    [2] The Earl of Airlie was born in 1856, and was the eldest son of the  seventh Earl, whom he succeeded in 1881. He was educated at Eton, and  entered the army in 1874. He served with the 10th Hussars in the Afghan  War in 1878-79. In that war he distinguished himself on more than one  occasion. He was present at the attack and capture of Ali Musjid, and in  the engagement at Futtehabad. He next saw active service in the Soudan  Expedition in 1884, and was present at the engagement at Temai. Then he  joined the Nile Expedition as brigade-major under Sir Herbert Stewart,  and was slightly wounded at Abu Klea, and in the reconnaissance to  Metemmeh. He was frequently mentioned in despatches for conspicuous  conduct, and for his distinguished services he received many medals,  clasps, and orders. From 1889 to 1895 he was on staff service as an  adjutant of the Hampshire Yeomanry Cavalry, and in 1897 he was appointed  lieutenant-colonel in command of the 12th Lancers, with which regiment he  went out to South Africa last year. He was a Scottish representative  peer, and deputy-lieutenant of the County of Forfar.

At the request of Sir Redvers Buller, on the 2nd of June, Christian  Botha, brother of Commandant Louis Botha, accompanied by Fourie and  Pretorius, met him near Majuba for the purpose of holding a conference  regarding terms of surrender of Laing's Nek. A proposition was made, of  course involving unconditional surrender, and hostilities were suspended  for three days in order that it might be digested by the Dutchmen. It was  found unpalatable and rejected. Whereupon the belligerents resumed their  warlike attitude. The interval had been utilised by the Boers, who had  entrenched themselves for about ten miles from Pogwani east of the  Buffalo, to the fringes of Majuba, and further westward still. The  natural barriers of Natal--the historic barriers that had made the \"grave  of reputations\"--were now terraced with trenches, and nodulous with  gun-pits. Another Gibraltar, frowning with menace, was prepared to  accommodate 5000 desperate Boers. But they had not calculated that a way  round might be found, and that they in their fastnesses might be \"turned\"  before they could utilise that cleverly arranged system of self-defence.  Yet the unforeseen occurred, and we shall see.    [Illustration: THE LAST BATTLE OF MAJUBA HILL--THE BATTLE OF ALMOND'S  NEK. (From a Sketch by Lieut. E. B. Knox, R.A.M.C.)]    On the 6th of June Sir Redvers Buller began his new move. General Talbot  Coke and the 10th Brigade and South African Light Horse, after some brisk  skirmishing with the enemy, seized Van Wyk's Hill, whereupon, during that  day, and the following day, the 7th, two 4.7-in. guns and two 12-pounder  naval guns were mounted on the eminence, while two 5-in. guns were  perched on the south-western spur of Inkwelo. General Hildyard, who  during the armistice had moved across from Utrecht to Ingogo,  concentrated his Division for advance over Botha's Pass, while General  Clery kept an eye on Laing's Nek, and beyond him General Lyttelton,  co-operating, brushed the enemy away from the right flank, and kept clear  the country between Utrecht and Wakkerstroom. Thus was prepared the way  for General Hildyard's brilliantly planned and admirably executed  assault of the spur of the Berg between Botha's Pass and Inkwelo, which  took place on the 8th, with the result that the enemy, some 2000 strong,  were outflanked and routed from their mountain strongholds, and the pass  was captured without serious loss.    The 9th was spent in a general halt on the summit of the pass, getting  the transport through the Drakensberg, hauling baggage up the steeps, and  skirmishing with Boers who hovered on the outskirts of the hills. The  labour entailed was prodigious, as the roads to the pass were intensely  precipitous, the hill being over a mile long, and many of the transport  waggons had to be double-spanned before they could make appreciable  advance. The troops, too, were sorely tried, for at night they shivered  in the crisp, frosty atmosphere, which appeared additionally numbing  after the warm sunlight of midday. Still, with unquenchable zeal, they  pursued their labours, climbing and clambering over boulder and slab, and  looking down on the chasms below with genuine satisfaction at the thought  of obstacles surmounted and decisive work to be accomplished. They had  now secured a commanding position, which in a very short"]]]
