[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#11)"],[1,"said something of  the kind: \"Laughter is the result of an expectation, which, of a  sudden, ends in nothing.\" No doubt these definitions would apply to the  last few examples given, although, even then, the formula needs the  addition of sundry limitations, for we often make an ineffectual effort  which is in no way provocative of laughter. While, however, the last  few examples are illustrations of a great cause resulting in a small  effect, we quoted others, immediately before, which might be defined  inversely as a great effect springing from a small cause. The truth is,  this second definition has scarcely more validity than the first. Lack  of proportion between cause and effect, whether appearing in one or in  the other, is never the direct source of laughter. What we do laugh at  is something that this lack of proportion may in certain cases  disclose, namely, a particular mechanical arrangement which it reveals  to us, as through a glass, at the back of the series of effects and  causes. Disregard this arrangement, and you let go the only clue  capable of guiding you through the labyrinth of the comic. Any  hypothesis you otherwise would select, while possibly applicable to a  few carefully chosen cases, is liable at any moment to be met and  overthrown by the first unsuitable instance that comes along.    But why is it we laugh at this mechanical arrangement? It is doubtless  strange that the history of a person or of a group should sometimes  appear like a game worked by strings, or gearings, or springs; but from  what source does the special character of this strangeness arise? What  is it that makes it laughable? To this question, which we have already  propounded in various forms, our answer must always be the same. The  rigid mechanism which we occasionally detect, as a foreign body, in the  living continuity of human affairs is of peculiar interest to us as  being a kind of ABSENTMINDEDNESS on the part of life. Were events  unceasingly mindful of their own course, there would be no  coincidences, no conjunctures and no circular series; everything would  evolve and progress continuously. And were all men always attentive to  life, were we constantly keeping in touch with others as well as with  ourselves, nothing within us would ever appear as due to the working of  strings or springs. The comic is that side of a person which reveals  his likeness to a thing, that aspect of human events which, through its  peculiar inelasticity, conveys the impression of pure mechanism, of  automatism, of movement without life. Consequently it expresses an  individual or collective imperfection which calls for an immediate  corrective. This corrective is laughter, a social gesture that singles  out and represses a special kind of absentmindedness in men and in  events.    But this in turn tempts us to make further investigations. So far, we  have spent our time in rediscovering, in the diversions of the grownup  man, those mechanical combinations which amused him as a child. Our  methods, in fact, have been entirely empirical. Let us now attempt to  frame a full and methodical theory, by seeking, as it were, at the  fountainhead, the changeless and simple archetypes of the manifold and  transient practices of the comic stage. Comedy, we said, combines  events so as to introduce mechanism into the outer forms of life. Let  us now ascertain in what essential characteristics life, when viewed  from without, seems to contrast with mere mechanism. We shall only  have, then, to turn to the opposite characteristics, in order to  discover the abstract formula, this time a general and complete one,  for every real and possible method of comedy.    Life presents itself to us as evolution in time and complexity in  space. Regarded in time, it is the continuous evolution of a being ever  growing older; it never goes backwards and never repeats anything.  Considered in space, it exhibits certain coexisting elements so closely  interdependent, so exclusively made for one another, that not one of  them could, at the same time, belong to two different organisms: each  living being is a closed system of phenomena, incapable of interfering  with other systems. A continual change of aspect, the irreversibility  of the order of phenomena, the perfect individuality of a perfectly  self-contained series: such, then, are the outward  characteristics--whether real or apparent is of little moment--which  distinguish the living from the merely mechanical. Let us take the  counterpart of each of these: we shall obtain three processes which  might be called REPETITION, INVERSION, and RECIPROCAL INTERFERENCE OF  SERIES. Now, it is easy to see that these are also the methods of light  comedy, and that no others are possible.    As a matter of fact, we could discover them, as ingredients of varying  importance, in the composition of all the scenes we have just been  considering, and, a fortiori, in the children's games, the mechanism of  which they reproduce. The requisite analysis would, however, delay us  too long, and it is more profitable to study them in their purity by  taking fresh examples. Nothing could be easier, for it is in their pure  state that they are found both in classic comedy and in contemporary  plays.    1. REPETITION.-Our present problem no longer deals, like the preceding  one, with a word or a sentence repeated by an individual, but rather  with a situation, that is, a combination of circumstances, which recurs  several times in its original form and thus contrasts with the changing  stream of life. Everyday experience supplies us with this type of the  comic, though only in a rudimentary state. Thus, you meet a friend in  the street whom you have not seen for an age; there is nothing comic in  the situation. If, however, you meet, him again the same day, and then  a third and a fourth time, you may laugh at the \"coincidence.\" Now,  picture to yourself a series of imaginary events which affords a  tolerably fair illusion of life, and within this ever-moving series  imagine one and the same scene reproduced either by the same characters  or by different ones: again you will have a coincidence, though a far  more extraordinary one.    Such are the repetitions produced on the stage. They are the more  laughable in proportion as the scene repeated is more complex and more  naturally introduced--two conditions which seem mutually exclusive, and  which the play-writer must be clever enough to reconcile.    Contemporary light comedy employs this method in every shape and form.  One of the best-known examples consists in bringing a group of  characters, act after act, into the most varied surroundings, so as to  reproduce, under ever fresh circumstances, one and the same series of  incidents or accidents more or less symmetrically identical.    In several of Moliere's plays we find one and the same arrangement of  events repeated right through the comedy from beginning to end. Thus,  the Ecole des femmes does nothing more than reproduce and repeat a  single incident in three tempi: first tempo, Horace tells Arnolphe of  the plan he has devised to deceive Agnes's guardian, who turns out to  be Arnolphe himself; second tempo, Arnolphe thinks he has checkmated  the move; third tempo, Agnes contrives that Horace gets all the benefit  of Arnolphe's precautionary measures. There is the same symmetrical  repetition in the Ecole des marts, in L'Etourdi, and above all in  George Dandin, where the same effect in three tempi is again met with:  first tempo, George Dandin discovers that his wife is unfaithful;  second tempo, he summons his father--and mother-in-law to his  assistance; third tempo, it is George Dandin himself, after all, who  has to apologise.    At times the same scene is reproduced with groups of different  characters. Then it not infrequently happens that the first group  consists of masters and the second of servants. The latter repeat in  another key a scene already played by the former, though the rendering  is naturally less refined. A part of the Depit amoureux is constructed  on this plan, as is also Amphitryon. In an amusing little comedy of  Benedix, Der Eigensinn, the order is inverted: we have the masters  reproducing a scene of stubbornness in which their servants have set  the example.    But, quite irrespective of the characters who serve as pegs for the  arrangement of symmetrical situations, there seems to be a wide gulf  between classic comedy and the theatre of to-day. Both aim at  introducing a certain mathematical order into events, while none the  less maintaining their aspect of likelihood, that is to say, of life.  But the means they employ are different. The majority of light comedies  of our day seek to mesmerise directly the mind of the spectator. For,  however extraordinary the coincidence, it becomes acceptable from the  very fact that it is accepted; and we do accept it, if we have been  gradually prepared for its reception. Such is often the procedure  adopted by contemporary authors. In Moliere's plays, on the contrary,  it is the moods of the persons on the stage, not of the audience, that  make repetition seem natural. Each of the characters represents a  certain force applied in a certain direction, and it is because these  forces, constant in direction, necessarily combine together in the same  way, that the same situation is reproduced. Thus interpreted, the  comedy of situation is akin to the comedy of character. It deserves to  be called classic, if classic art is indeed that which does not claim  to derive from the effect more than it has put into the cause.    2. Inversion.--This second method has so much analogy with the first  that we will merely define it without insisting on illustrations.  Picture to yourself certain characters in a certain situation: if you  reverse the situation and invert the roles, you obtain a comic scene.

Mrs. Bostwick, still intently listening to her  precocious daughter, without thinking what she did, took the  remaining piece, which was the white one, and slowly devoured it.    The dish was now empty, and Claribel Sudds' precious bonbons had  passed from her possession forever!    Suddenly Mr. Bostwick, who was a big man, began to sing in a shrill,  tremolo soprano voice. It was not the same song Bessie was playing,  and the discord was shocking that the professor smiled, the senator  put his hands to his ears and Mrs. Bostwick cried in a horrified  voice:    \"William!\"    Her husband continued to sing as if endeavoring to emulate the  famous Christine Nillson, and paid no attention whatever to his wife  or his guests.    Fortunately the dinner gong now sounded, and Mrs. Bostwick dragged  Bessie from the piano and ushered her guests into the dining-room.  Mr. Bostwick followed, singing \"The Last Rose of Summer\" as if it  had been an encore demanded by a thousand delighted hearers.    The poor woman was in despair at witnessing her husband's  undignified actions and wondered what she might do to control him.  The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's face wore  an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she  still wanted to play the piano.    Mrs. Bostwick managed to get them all seated, although her husband  had broken into another aria; and then the maid brought in the soup.    When she carried a plate to the professor, he cried, in an excited  voice:    \"Hold it higher! Higher--I say!\" And springing up he gave it a  sudden kick that sent it nearly to the ceiling, from whence the dish  descended to scatter soup over Bessie and the maid and to smash in  pieces upon the crown of the professor's bald head.    At this atrocious act the senator rose from his seat with an  exclamation of horror and glanced at his hostess.    For some time Mrs. Bostwick had been staring straight ahead, with a  dazed expression; but now, catching the senator's eye, she bowed  gracefully and began reciting \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" in  forceful tones.    The senator shuddered. Such disgraceful rioting he had never seen  nor heard before in a decent private family. He felt that his  reputation was at stake, and, being the only sane person,  apparently, in the room, there was no one to whom he might appeal.    The maid had run away to cry hysterically in the kitchen; Mr.  Bostwick was singing \"O Promise Me;\" the professor was trying to  kick the globes off the chandelier; Mrs. Bostwick had switched her  recitation to \"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck,\" and Bessie had  stolen into the parlor and was pounding out the overture from the  \"Flying Dutchman.\"    The senator was not at all sure he would not go crazy himself,  presently; so he slipped away from the turmoil, and, catching up his  had and coat in the hall, hurried from the house.    That night he sat up late writing a political speech he was to  deliver the next afternoon at Faneuil hall, but his experiences at  the Bostwicks' had so unnerved him that he could scarcely collect  his thoughts, and often he would pause and shake his head pityingly  as he remembered the strange things he had seen in that usually  respectable home.    The next day he met Mr. Bostwick in the street, but passed him by  with a stony glare of oblivion. He felt he really could not afford  to know this gentleman in the future. Mr. Bostwick was naturally  indignant at the direct snub; yet in his mind lingered a faint  memory of some quite unusual occurrences at his dinner party the  evening before, and he hardly knew whether he dared resent the  senator's treatment or not.    The political meeting was the feature of the day, for the senator's  eloquence was well known in Boston. So the big hall was crowded with  people, and in one of the front rows sat the Bostwick family, with  the learned Yale professor beside them. They all looked tired and  pale, as if they had passed a rather dissipated evening, and the  senator was rendered so nervous by seeing them that he refused to  look in their direction a second time.    While the mayor was introducing him the great man sat fidgeting in  his chair; and, happening to put his thumb and finger into his vest  pocket, he found the lavender-colored bonbon he had placed there the  evening before.    \"This may clear my throat,\" thought the senator, and slipped the  bonbon into his mouth.    A few minutes afterwards he arose before the vast audience, which  greeted him with enthusiastic plaudits.    \"My friends,\" began the senator, in a grave voice, \"this is a most  impressive and important occasion.\"    Then he paused, balanced himself upon his left foot, and kicked his  right leg into the air in the way favored by ballet-dancers!    There was a hum of amazement and horror from the spectators, but the  senator appeared not to notice it. He whirled around upon the tips  of his toes, kicked right and left in a graceful manner, and  startled a bald-headed man in the front row by casting a languishing  glance in his direction.    Suddenly Claribel Sudds, who happened to be present, uttered a scream  and sprang to her feet. Pointing an accusing finger at the dancing  senator, she cried in a loud voice:    \"That's the man who stole my bonbons! Seize him! Arrest him! Don't  let him escape!\"    But the ushers rushed her out of the hall, thinking she had gone  suddenly insane; and the senator's friends seized him firmly and  carried him out the stage entrance to the street, where they put him  into an open carriage and instructed the driver to take him home.    The effect of the magic bonbon was still powerful enough to control  the poor senator, who stood upon the rear seat of the carriage and  danced energetically all the way home, to the delight of the crowd  of small boys who followed the carriage and the grief of the  sober-minded citizens, who shook their heads sadly and whispered  that \"another good man had gone wrong.\"    It took the senator several months to recover from the shame and  humiliation of this escapade; and, curiously enough, he never had  the slightest idea what had induced him to act in so extraordinary a  manner. Perhaps it was fortunate the last bonbon had now been eaten,  for they might easily have caused considerably more trouble than  they did.    Of course Claribel went again to the wise chemist and signed a check  for another box of magic bonbons; but she must have taken better  care of these, for she is now a famous vaudeville actress.    * * * * *    This story should teach us the folly of condemning others for  actions that we do not understand, for we never know what may happen  to ourselves. It may also serve as a hint to be careful about  leaving parcels in public places, and, incidentally, to let other  people's packages severely alone.          THE CAPTURE OF FATHER TIME      Jim was the son of a cowboy, and lived on the broad plains of  Arizona. His father had trained him to lasso a bronco or a young  bull with perfect accuracy, and had Jim possessed the strength to  back up his skill he would have been as good a cowboy as any in all  Arizona.    When he was twelve years old he made his first visit to the east,  where Uncle Charles, his father's brother, lived. Of course Jim took  his lasso with him, for he was proud of his skill in casting it, and  wanted to show his cousins what a cowboy could do.    At first the city boys and girls were much interested in watching  Jim lasso posts and fence pickets, but they soon tired of it, and  even Jim decided it was not the right sort of sport for cities.    But one day the butcher asked Jim to ride one of his horses into the  country, to a pasture that had been engaged, and Jim eagerly  consented. He had been longing for a horseback ride, and to make it  seem like old times he took his lasso with him.    He rode through the streets demurely enough, but on reaching the  open country roads his spirits broke forth into wild jubilation,  and, urging the butcher's horse to full gallop, he dashed away in  true cowboy fashion.    Then he wanted still more liberty, and letting down the bars that  led into a big field he began riding over the meadow and throwing  his lasso at imaginary cattle, while he yelled and whooped to his  heart's content.    Suddenly, on making a long cast with his lasso, the loop caught upon  something and rested about three feet from the ground, while the  rope drew taut and nearly pulled Jim from his horse.    This was unexpected. More than that, it was wonderful; for the field  seemed bare of even a stump. Jim's eyes grew big with amazement, but  he knew he had caught something when a voice cried out:    \"Here, let go! Let go, I say! Can't you see what you've done?\"    No, Jim couldn't see, nor did he intend to let go until he found out  what was holding the loop of the lasso. So he resorted to an old  trick his father had taught him and, putting the butcher's horse to  a run, began riding in a circle around the spot where his lasso had  caught.    As he thus drew nearer and nearer his quarry he saw the rope coil  up, yet it looked to be coiling over nothing but air. One end of the  lasso was made fast to a ring in the saddle, and when the rope was  almost wound up and the horse began to pull away and snort with  fear, Jim dismounted. Holding the reins of the bridle in one hand,  he followed the rope, and an instant later saw an old man caught  fast in the coils of the lasso.    His head was bald and uncovered, but long white whiskers grew down  to his waist. About his body was thrown a loose robe of fine white  linen. In one hand he bore a great scythe, and beneath the other arm  he carried an hourglass.    While Jim gazed wonderingly upon him, this venerable old man spoke  in an angry voice:    \"Now, then--get that rope off as fast as you can! You've brought  everything on earth to a standstill by your "]]]
