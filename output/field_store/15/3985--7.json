You needn't grin, I'm  serious about it.\"    There was a thoughtful pause, and one or two scratched their heads.  \"His wife seems pretty sick,\" Mitchell went on in a reflective tone. \"I  passed the place this morning and saw him scrubbing out the floor. He's  been doing a bit of house-painting for old Heegard to-day. I suppose he  learnt it in jail. I saw him at work and touched my hat to him.\"    \"What!\" cried Tom Hall, affecting to shrink from Mitchell in horror.    \"Yes,\" said Mitchell, \"I'm not sure that I didn't take my hat off. Now  I know it's not bush religion for a man to touch his hat, except to a  funeral, or a strange roof or woman sometimes; but when I meet a braver  man than myself I salute him. I've only met two in my life.\"    \"And who were they, Jack?\" asked Jake Boreham.    \"One,\" said Mitchell--\"one is Douglas, and the other--well, the other  was the man I used to be. But that's got nothing to do with it.\"    \"But perhaps Douglas thought you were crowing over him when you took  off your hat to him--sneerin' at him, like, Mitchell,\" reflected Jake  Boreham.    \"No, Jake,\" said Mitchell, growing serious suddenly. \"There are ways of  doing things that another man understands.\"    They all thought for a while.    \"Well,\" said Tom Hall, \"supposing we do take up a collection for him,  he'd be too damned proud to take it.\"    \"But that's where we've got the pull on him,\" said Mitchell, brightening  up. \"I heard Dr Morgan say that Mrs Douglas wouldn't live if she wasn't  sent away to a cooler place, and Douglas knows it; and, besides, one of  the little girls is sick. We've got him in a corner and he'll have to  take the stuff. Besides, two years in jail takes a lot of the pride out  of a man.\"    \"Well, I'm damned if I'll give a sprat to help the man who tried his  best to crush the Unions!\" said One-eyed Bogan.    \"Damned if I will either!\" said Barcoo-Rot.    \"Now, look here, One-eyed Bogan,\" said Mitchell, \"I don't like to harp  on old things, for I know they bore you, but when you returned to public  life that time no one talked of kicking you out of the town. In fact, I  heard that the chaps put a few pounds together to help you get away for  a while till you got over your modesty.\"    No one spoke.    \"I passed Douglas's place on my way here from my camp to-night,\"  Mitchell went on musingly, \"and I saw him walking up and down in the  yard with his sick child in his arms. You remember that little girl,  Bogan? I saw her run and pick up your hat and give it to you one day  when you were trying to put it on with your feet. You remember, Bogan?  The shock nearly sobered you.\"    There was a very awkward pause. The position had become too  psychological altogether and had to be ended somehow. The awkward  silence had to be broken, and Bogan broke it. He turned up Bob  Brothers's hat, which was lying on the table, and \"chucked\" in a \"quid,\"  qualifying the hat and the quid, and disguising his feelings with the  national oath of the land.    \"We've had enough of this gory, maudlin, sentimental tommy-rot,\"  he said. \"Here, Barcoo, stump up or I'll belt it out of your hide!  I'll--I'll take yer to pieces!\"    But Douglas didn't leave the town. He sent his wife and children to  Sydney until the heat wave was past, built a new room on to the cottage,  and started a book and newspaper shop, and a poultry farm in the back  paddock, and flourished.    They called him Mr Douglas for a while, then Douglas, then Percy  Douglas, and now he is well-known as Old Daddy Douglas, and the Sydney  _Worker_, _Truth_, and _Bulletin_, and other democratic rags are on sale  at his shop. He is big with schemes for locking the Darling River,  and he gets his drink at O'Donohoo's. He is scarcely yet regarded as a  straight-out democrat. He was a gentleman once, Mitchell said, and the  old blood was not to be trusted. But, last elections, Douglas worked  quietly for Unionism, and gave the leaders certain hints, and put them  up to various electioneering dodges which enabled them to return, in  the face of Monopoly, a Labour member who is as likely to go straight as  long as any other Labour member.          THE BLINDNESS OF ONE-EYED BOGAN        They judge not and they are not judged--'tis their philosophy--      (There's something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea).                                       -The Ballad of the Rouseabout.    \"And what became of One-eyed Bogan?\" I asked Tom Hall when I met him and  Jack Mitchell down in Sydney with their shearing cheques the Christmas  before last.    \"You'd better ask Mitchell, Harry,\" said Tom. \"He can tell you about  Bogan better than I can. But first, what about the drink we're going to  have?\"    We turned out of Pitt Street into Hunter Street, and across George  Street, where a double line of fast electric tramway was running, into  Margaret Street and had a drink at Pfahlert's Hotel, where a counter  lunch--as good as many dinners you get for a shilling--was included with  a sixpenny drink. \"Get a quiet corner,\" said Mitchell, \"I like to bear  myself cackle.\" So we took our beer out in the fernery and got a cool  place at a little table in a quiet corner amongst the fern boxes.    \"Well, One-eyed Bogan was a hard case, Mitchell,\" I said. \"Wasn't he?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mitchell, putting down his \"long-beer\" glass, \"he was.\"    \"Rather a bad egg?\"    \"Yes, a regular bad egg,\" said Mitchell, decidedly.    \"I heard he got caught cheating at cards,\" I said.    \"Did you?\" said Mitchell. \"Well, I believe he did. Ah, well,\" he added  reflectively, after another long pull, \"One-eyed Bogan won't cheat at  cards any more.\"    \"Why?\" I said. \"Is he dead then?\"    \"No,\" said Mitchell, \"he's blind.\"    \"Good God!\" I said, \"how did that happen?\"    \"He lost the other eye,\" said Mitchell, and he took another drink. \"Ah,  well, he won't cheat at cards any more--unless there's cards invented  for the blind.\"    \"How did it happen?\" I asked.    \"Well,\" said Mitchell, \"you see, Harry, it was this way. Bogan went  pretty free in Bourke after the shearing before last, and in the end he  got mixed up in a very ugly-looking business: he was accused of doing  two new-chum jackaroos out of their stuff by some sort of confidence  trick.\"    \"Confidence trick,\" I said. \"I'd never have thought that One-eyed Bogan  had the brains to go in for that sort of thing.\"    \"Well, it seems he had, or else he used somebody else's brains; there's  plenty of broken-down English gentlemen sharpers knocking about out  back, you know, and Bogan might have been taking lessons from one.  I don't know the rights of the case, it was hushed up, as you'll see  presently; but, anyway, the jackaroos swore that Bogan had done 'em  out of ten quid. They were both Cockneys and I suppose they reckoned  themselves smart, but bushmen have more time to think. Besides, Bogan's  one eye was in his favour. You see he always kept his one eye fixed  strictly on whatever business he had in hand; if he'd had another eye to  rove round and distract his attention and look at things on the outside,  the chances are he would never have got into trouble.\"    \"Never mind that, Jack,\" said Tom Hall. \"Harry wants to hear the yarn.\"    \"Well, to make it short, one of the jackaroos went to the police and  Bogan cleared out. His character was pretty bad just then, so there was  a piece of blue paper out for him. Bogan didn't seem to think the thing  was so serious as it was, for he only went a few miles down the river  and camped with his horses on a sort of island inside an anabranch, till  the thing should blow over or the new chums leave Bourke.    \"Bogan's old enemy, Constable Campbell, got wind of Bogan's camp, and  started out after him. He rode round the outside track and came in on to  the river just below where the anabranch joins it, at the lower end  of the island and right opposite Bogan's camp. You know what those  billabongs are: dry gullies till the river rises from the Queensland  rains and backs them up till the water runs round into the river again  and makes anabranches of 'em--places that you thought were hollows  you'll find above water, and you can row over places you thought were  hills. There's no water so treacherous and deceitful as you'll find in  some of those billabongs. A man starts to ride across a place where  he thinks the water is just over the grass, and blunders into a deep  channel--that wasn't there before--with a steady undercurrent with the  whole weight of the Darling River funnelled into it; and if he can't  swim and his horse isn't used to it--or sometimes if he can swim--it's a  case with him, and the Darling River cod hold an inquest on him, if they  have time, before he's buried deep in Darling River mud for ever. And  somebody advertises in the missing column for Jack Somebody who was last  heard of in Australia.\"    \"Never mind that, Mitchell, go on,\" I said.    \"Well, Campbell knew the river and saw that there was a stiff current  there, so he hailed Bogan.    \"'Good day, Campbell,' shouted Bogan.    \"`I want you, Bogan,' said Campbell. `Come across and bring your  horses.'    \"`I'm damned if I will,' says Bogan. `I'm not going to catch me death o'  cold to save your skin. If you want me you'll have to bloody well come  and git me.' Bogan was a good strong swimmer, and he had good horses,  but he didn't try to get away--I suppose he reckoned he'd have to face  the music one time or another--and one time is as good as another out  back.    \"Campbell was no swimmer; he had no temptation to risk his life--you see  it wasn't as in war with a lot of comrades watching ready to advertise a  man as a coward for staying alive--so he argued with Bogan and tried to  get him to listen to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7070"],[0,"The Treasure of the Incas: A Story of Adventure in Peru (#11)"],[1,"that nothing approaching an accurate map can ever have been made of the  mountains, and I should say that in most cases the indications that may  have been given are very vague. They would no doubt have been  sufficient for those who lived soon after the money was hidden, and  were natives of that part of the country and thoroughly acquainted with  all the surroundings, but when the information came to be handed down  from mouth to mouth during many generations, the local knowledge would  be lost, and what were at first detailed instructions would become  little better than vague legends. You know how three hundred years will  alter the face of a country--rocks roll down the hills, torrents wash  away the soil, forests grow or are cleared away. I believe with you  that the Indian will do his best, but I have grave doubts whether he  will be able to locate any big thing.\"    \"Well, you don't take a very cheerful view of things, Harry; you  certainly seemed more hopeful when we first started.\"    \"Yes. I don't say I am not hopeful still, but it is one thing to plan  out an enterprise at a distance and quite another when you are face to  face with its execution. As we have come down the coast, and seen that  great range of mountains stretching along for hundreds of miles, and we  know that there is another quite as big lying behind it, I have begun  to realize the difficulties of the adventures that we are undertaking.  However, we shall hear, when Dias comes over to see us, what he thinks  of the matter. I fancy he will say that he is willing to go with us and  help us as far as he can, but that although he will do his best he  cannot promise that he will be able to point out, with anything like  certainty, the position of any of the old mines.\"    Next day they called on Senor Pasquez, who received them very cordially.    \"So you are going to follow the example of Senor Barnett and spend some  time in exploring the country and doing some shooting. Have you found  Dias?\"    \"Yes, senor, and I think he will go with us, though he has not given a  positive answer.\"    \"You will be fortunate if you get him; he is one of the best-known  muleteers in the country, and if anyone comes here and wants a guide  Dias is sure to be the first to be recommended. If he goes with you he  can give you much useful advice; he knows exactly what you will have to  take with you, the best districts to visit for your purpose, and the  best way of getting there. For the rest, I shall be very happy to take  charge of any money you may wish to leave behind, and to act as your  banker and cash any orders you may draw upon me. I will also receive  and place to your account any sums that may be sent you from England.\"    \"That, sir, is a matter which Mr. Barnett advised me to place in your  hands. After making what few purchases we require, and taking fifty  pounds in silver, I shall have two hundred and fifty pounds to place in  your hands. Mr. Barnett will manage my affairs in my absence, and will  send to you fifty pounds quarterly.\"    \"You will find difficulty in spending it all in two years,\" the  merchant said with a smile. \"If you are content to live on what can be  bought in the country, it costs very little; and as for the mules, they  can generally pick up enough at their halting-places to serve them,  with a small allowance of grain. You can hire them cheaply, or you can  buy them. The latter is cheaper in the end, but you cannot be sure of  getting mules accustomed to mountains, and you would therefore run the  risk of their losing their foothold, and not only being dashed to  pieces but destroying their saddles and loads. However, if you secure  the services of Dias Otero, you will get mules that know every path in  the mountains. He is famous for his animals, and he himself is  considered the most trusty muleteer here; men think themselves lucky in  obtaining his services. I would send him with loads of uncounted gold  and should be sure that there would not be a piece missing.\"    Next day Dias came to the hotel.    \"I have thought it over, senor,\" he said. \"I need not say that were it  only ordinary service, instead of exploring the mountains, I should be  glad indeed to do my best for a friend of Senor Barnett; but as to the  real purpose of your journey I wish, before making any arrangement,  that the matter should be thoroughly understood. I have no certain  knowledge whatever as to any of the lost mines, still less of any  hidden treasures; but I know all the traditions that have passed down  concerning them. I doubt whether any Indians now possess a certain  knowledge of these things. For generations, no doubt, the secrets were  handed down from father to son, and it is possible that some few may  still know of these places; but I doubt it. Think of the hundreds and  thousands of our people who have been killed in battle, or died as  slaves in the mines, and you will see that numbers of those to whom the  secrets were entrusted must have taken their knowledge to the grave  with them.    \"In each generation the number of those who knew the particulars of  these hiding-places must have diminished. Few now can know more than I  do, yet I am sure of nothing. I know generally where the mines were  situated and where some treasures were concealed, and what knowledge I  have I will place at your service; but so great a care was used in the  concealment of the entrances to the mines, so carefully were the  hiding-places of the treasures chosen, and so cunningly concealed,  that, without the surest indications and the most minute instructions,  we might search for years, as men indeed have done ever since the  Spanish came here, without finding them. I am glad that I can lay my  hand upon my heart and say, that whatever may have been possessed by  ancestors of mine, no actual details have ever come down to me; for,  had it been so, I could not have revealed them to you. We know that all  who were instructed in these were bound by the most terrible oaths not  to reveal them. Numbers have died under the torture rather than break  those oaths; and even now, were one of us to betray the secrets that  had come down to him, he would be regarded as accursed. No one would  break bread with him, every door would be closed against him, and if he  died his body would rot where it fell. But my knowledge is merely  general, gathered not only from the traditions known to all our people,  but from confidences made by one member of our family to another. Full  knowledge was undoubtedly given to some of them; but all these must  have died without initiating others into the full particulars. Such  knowledge as I have is at your disposal. I can take you to the  localities, I can say to you, 'Near this place was a great mine,' but  unless chance favours you you may search in vain.\"    \"That is quite as much as I had hoped for, Dias, and I am grateful for  your willingness to do what you can for us, just as you did for Senor  Barnett.\"          CHAPTER IV    A STREET FRAY      \"Now, senor,\" Dias said, \"as we have settled the main point, let us  talk over the arrangements. What is the weight of your baggage?\"    \"Not more than a mule could carry. Of course we shall sling our rifles  over our shoulders. We have a good stock of ammunition for them and for  our pistols. We shall each take two suits of clothes besides those we  wear, and a case of spirits in the event of accident or illness. We  shall each have three flannel shirts, stockings, and so on, but  certainly everything belonging to us personally would not mount up to  more than a hundred and fifty pounds. We should, of course, require a  few cooking utensils, tin plates, mugs, and cups. What should we need  besides these?\"    \"A tent and bedding, senor. We should only have, at the start, to carry  such provisions as we could not buy. When we are beyond the range of  villages in the forests we might often be weeks without being able to  buy anything; still, we should probably be able to shoot game for food.  We should find fruits, but flour we shall have to take with us from the  last town we pass through before we strike into the mountains, and  dried meat for an emergency; and it would be well to have a bag of  grain, so that we could give a handful or so to each of the mules. I am  glad you have brought some good spirits--we shall need it in the swamps  by the rivers. Your tea and coffee will save your having to buy them  here, but you will want some sugar. We must take two picks and a  shovel, a hammer for breaking up ore, a small furnace, twenty crucibles  and bellows, and a few other things for aiding to melt the ore. You  would want for the journey five baggage mules, and, of course, three  riding mules. I could hardly manage them, even with aid from you, in  very bad places, and I would rather not take any strange man with me on  such business as we have in hand. But some assistance I must have, and  I will take with me my nephew Jose. He has lost his father, and I have  taken him as my assistant, and shall train him to be a guide such as I  am. He is but fifteen, but he already knows something of his business,  and such an expedition will teach him more than he would learn in ten  years on the roads.\"    \"That would certainly be far better than having a muleteer whom you  could not trust, Dias. My brother and myself will be ready to lend you  a hand whenever you want help of any kind. We have not had any  experience with mules, but sailors can generally turn their hands to  anything. Now, how about the eight mules?\"    \"I have five of my own, as good mules as are to be found in the  province; we shall have to buy the three others for riding. Of course I  have saddles and ropes.\"    \"But you will want four for riding.\"    \"No, senor; yours and the one I ride will be enough. Jose at times will  take my place, and can when he likes perch on one of the most lightly  laden animals.\"  "]]]
