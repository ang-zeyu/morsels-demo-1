In the afternoon Orson Pratt addressed the  Church on the necessity of keeping the commandments of God. I spoke,  and admonished the members of the Church individually to set their  houses in order, to make clean the inside of the platter, and to {5}  meet on the next Sabbath to partake of the Sacrament, in order that by  our obedience to the ordinances, we might be enabled to prevail with  God against the destroyer, and that the sick might be healed.    All this week chiefly spent among the sick, who in general are gaining  strength, and recovering health.    [Sidenote: Prayer Meeting for the Sick.]    _Sunday, August 4._--The Church came together for prayer meeting and  Sacrament. I exhorted the Church at length, concerning the necessity of  being righteous, and clean at heart before the Lord. Many others also  spoke; especially some of the Twelve, who were present, professed their  willingness to proceed on their mission to Europe, without either purse  or scrip. The Sacrament was administered; a spirit of humility and  harmony prevailed, and the Church passed a resolution that the Twelve  proceed on their mission as soon as possible, and that the Saints  provide for their families during their absence.        _Letter to Isaac Russell, reproving him for issuing pretended      revelations to the Saints_.        Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois, 5th August, 1839.        Dear Sir:--I have been requested to write you on behalf of the      Twelve, who are just on the eve of their departure for England, and      {6} inform you, that \"this thing\" which you have thought proper to      write as a revelation \"to the Church in Alston and the branches      round about,\" to which you yourself administered, has \"already come      to the knowledge of the Churches\" both here and elsewhere, and lest      you should have any doubt concerning the fact, we send you a copy      of your revelation to that Church.        I am sir, with all respect,        Yours truly,        James Mulholland.        P. S.--Isaiah chap. L, 10th and 11th verses. [5] In my own behalf I      wish to state that I sincerely wish that it may soon come to pass      that you, sir, and all our friends at Far West may perceive that      you are walking in the light of a fire, and sparks that you have      yourselves kindled; and that you may turn around and fear the Lord,      obey the voice of His servant, and thereby escape the sentence, \"Ye      shall lie down in sorrow.\"        J. M.        _To Mr. Isaac Russell, Far West, Missouri_.    _Conference in New Jersey_.    _Friday, 9_.--A Conference was held at Brother Caleb Bennett's Monmouth  County, New Jersey, Elder John P. Greene presiding. The New York and  Brooklyn branches were represented by the President as being in good  fellowship. There were represented at this conference the following  branches, by Elder Ball, Shrewsbury, New Jersey, numbering twenty  members; Montage, three; Minissink, New Hampshire, two; Albany, eight;  Holliston, Massachusetts, sixteen; Elder Dunham represented Hamilton,  Madison County, forty-six; Samuel James, Leechburg, Pennsylvania, forty.    _Sunday, 11_.--I attended meeting in the forenoon and heard a sermon  by Parley P. Pratt. In the afternoon there was one baptized, and four  were confirmed, namely, {7} Brother Hibbard, his wife, little son, and  daughter. The Sacrament was administered.    This week I spent chiefly in visiting the sick; sickness much decreased.    _Sunday, 18_.--Rode out in the forenoon. Orson Pratt preached upon the  order and plan of creation. Three were baptized.    Afternoon: Three confirmed and one ordained an Elder.    This week I spent chiefly among the sick. The Church made a purchase  of eighty acres from William White for four thousand dollars, lying  directly north of the Hugh White purchase.    _Sunday, 25_.--I attended meeting. Sickness decreasing.    _Thursday, 29_.--Elders Parley P. Pratt and family, Orson Pratt  and Hiram Clark, started on their mission to England, in their own  two-horse carriage--their route lying through Illinois, Indiana, and to  Detroit, the capital of Michigan, situated near the head of Lake Erie,  about five hundred and eighty miles distant.    [Sidenote: Progress of the Work in England.]    _Saturday, 31_.--The work is spreading in England. Elder Richards  went to the Staffordshire potteries this day, and Presidents Joseph  Fielding and William Clayton were visiting and setting in order many of  the branches, and ordaining many to the ministry who are diligent in  preaching as they have opportunity on the Sabbath in the surrounding  villages.    _Sunday, September 1_.--I attended meeting, and spoke concerning some  errors in Parley P. Pratt's writings. This week sickness much decreased.    _Monday, 9_, and the greater part of the week.--I spent in visiting the  sick, and attending to the settlement of our new town. [6]    {8}        _The Prophet's Letter to Isaac Galland.--Nauvoo Affairs_.        Commerce, Illinois, 11th September, 1839.        Dear Brother Galland:--We have had the great pleasure of receiving      your favor of the 24th July; and learning thereby that you and      your family had arrived at Chillicothe in safety and in health. We      perceive that you have had a rather narrow escape from a serious      accident; and doubtless the hand of the Lord is to be acknowledged      in the matter, although unperceived by mortal eye. Time and      experience will teach us more and more how easily falsehood gains      credence with mankind in general, rather than the truth; but      especially in taking into consideration the plan of salvation. The      plain simple order of the Gospel of Jesus Christ never has been      discerned or acknowledged as the truth, except by a few--among whom      were \"not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many      noble;\" whilst the majority have contented themselves with their      own private opinions, or have adopted those of others, according      to their address, their philosophy, their formula, their policy,      or their fineness may have attracted their attention, or pleased      their taste. But, sir, of all the other criterions whereby we may      judge of the vanity of these things, one will be always found true,      namely, that we will always find such characters glorying in their      own wisdom and their own works; whilst the humble Saint gives all      the glory to God the Father, and to His Son Jesus Christ, whose      yoke is easy and whose burden is light, and who told His disciples      that unless they became like little children they could not enter      the Kingdom of Heaven.        As to the situation of the Church here, matters go with us as well      as can reasonably be expected; we have had considerable sickness      amongst us, but very few deaths; and as the greater part are now      recovering we yet hope to have shelters provided before the winter      shall set in.        Since you left here, we have purchased out all Mr. Hotchkiss'      interest hereabouts. His farm we have laid out as an addition to      our town, Nauvoo, and the town of Commerce we also hope to build up.        Some of the Twelve and others have already started for Europe, and      the remainder of that mission we expect will go now in a few days.      According to intelligence received since you left, the work of      the Lord rolls on in a very pleasing manner, both in this and in      the old country. In England many hundreds have of late been added      to our numbers; but so, even so, it must be, for \"Ephraim he hath      mixed himself among the people.\" And the Savior He hath said, \"My      sheep hear my voice;\" and also, \"He that heareth you, heareth me;\"      and, \"Behold I will bring them again from the north country, and      gather them from the coasts of the earth.\" And as John heard the      voice saying, \"Come out of her, {9} my people,\" even so must all be      fulfilled; that the people of the Lord may live when \"Babylon the      great is fallen, is fallen.\"        There has quite a number of families gathered up here already; and      we anticipate a continuance, especially as upon inquiry we have      found that we have not had more than [the usual] ratio of sickness      here, notwithstanding the trials we have had, and the hardships to      which we have been exposed. Calculating as we do, upon the mercy      and power of God in our behalf, we hope to persevere on in every      good and useful work, even unto the end, that when we come to be      tried in the balance we may not be found wanting.        With all good wishes and prayers for the temporal and eternal      salvation of yourself and your family, as well as of all the honest      in heart over the face of the earth,        We remain, sir, with sincerity,        Your friend and brother,        Joseph Smith, Jun.        _Addressed to Isaac Galland, Esq., Kirtland, Geauga, County, Ohio_.    _Friday, 13_.--I left home for Brother William Smith's place.    [Sidenote: Brigham Young Starts on his Mission.]    _Saturday, 14_.--President Brigham Young started from his home at  Montrose, for England. His health was very poor; he was unable to go  thirty rods to the river without assistance. After he had crossed the  ferry he got Brother Israel Barlow to carry him on his horse behind him  to Heber C. Kimball's where he remained sick until the 18th. He left  his wife sick with a babe only ten days old, and all his children sick,  unable to wait upon each other. I returned home this evening.    _Sunday, 15_.--I was visiting the sick.    _Monday and Tuesday, 16 and 17_.--Was engaged in arranging the town  lots.

The  identity of the principle is complete, and tends to establish identity  of authorship.    _6. The Evidence of the Particularization of Ideas_.    In the revelation on marriage there is a singularity of expression,  which, for want of a better term, I will call a particularization of  ideas, that is decidedly peculiar to the Prophet, for example: \"And  verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All  covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances,  connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made, and  entered into, and sealed, by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who  is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too  most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine  anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power, (and  I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last  days, and there is never but one on the earth, at a time, on whom  this power and the keys of this Priesthood are conferred,) are of no  efficacy, virtue or force, in and after the resurrection from the dead;  for all contracts that are not made unto this end, have an end when men  are dead. * * * * And everything that is in the world, whether it be  ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of  name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me, or by my word, saith  the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are  dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God!\"  (verses 7, 13).    A similar particularization of things is found in verses 15, 18, 19,  26, 30, 59, 61, of the revelation on marriage.    With the above quoted passage compare the following: \"Whoso receiveth  you receiveth me, and the same will feed you, and clothe you and  give you money. And he who feeds you, or clothes you or gives you  money, shall in no wise loose his reward: And he that doeth not these  things is not my disciple; by this you may know my disciples. He that  receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves, and {XLIV}  cleanse your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in  cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven,  and return not again unto that man. And in whatsoever village or city  ye enter, do likewise. Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not;  and wo unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you,  or your words, or your testimony concerning me. Wo, I say again,  unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your  words, or your testimony of me.\" Sec. 84: 89-95. Similar passages of  particularization frequently occur in other revelations. The following  is a notable example:    \"All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be  revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the  Gospel of Jesus Christ; and also if there be bounds set to the heavens  or to the seas; or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars;  all the times of their revolutions; all the appointed days, months  and years, and all the days of their months and years, and all their  glories, laws and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the  dispensation of the fullness of times, according to that which was  ordained in the midst of the council of the eternal God of all other  Gods, before the world was\" (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 121: 29-31).    _7. The Evidences of Identity in Grandeur of Style_.    One other peculiarity in the inspired style of the Prophet is  seen in a certain growing grandeur in statement, by means of  repetitions--repetitions, too, that make a paragraph fairly scintillate  with prismatic hues as well as giving to it a _crescendo_ of emphasis:  for example, in speaking of the glory that shall come to those who keep  covenant with the Lord, it is written in this revelation on marriage:    \"And they shall pass by the angels, and the Gods which are set there,  to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon  their heads, which glory shall be a fullness and a continuation of the  seeds for ever and ever.    Then shall they be Gods, because they have no end;    Therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they  continue;    Then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them.    Then shall they be Gods, because they have all power, and the angels  are subject unto them\" [E] (verses 19-21).    [Footnote E: I have taken liberty of placing the lines in poetic form,  to which they so readily lend themselves, that they may be the more  readily compared with the verses from another revelation which follows  from Doc. and Cov., sec 84.]    With this compare the following:    {XLV} \"The power and authority of the Higher or Melchisedek, Priesthood,  is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the Church--to  have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of  heaven--to have the heavens opened unto them--to commune with the  general assembly and church of the first born, and to enjoy the  communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the Mediator of the  new covenant\" (Sec. 107: 18, 19). Also this:    \"And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of  murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast  into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce  winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the  elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws  of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son,  that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy  good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all; art thou greater  than he?\"    And as covering both the two last peculiarities--particularization of  things and a growing grandeur in statement by repetition, consider the  following passage:    \"I the Almighty have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them  for their wickedness: and plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be  taken from the earth until I have completed my work which shall be cut  short in righteousness, until all shall know me, who remain, even from  the least unto the greatest, and shall be filled with the knowledge of  the Lord, and shall see eye to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and  with the voice together sing this new song, saying--      The Lord hath brought again Zion;    The Lord hath redeemed His people, Israel,    According to the election of grace,    Which was brought to pass by the faith    And covenant of their fathers.      The Lord hath redeemed His people,    And Satan is bound and time is no longer:    The Lord hath gathered all things in one:    The Lord hath brought down Zion from above.    The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath.      The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength:    And truth is established in her bowels:    And the heavens have smiled upon her:    And she is clothed with the glory of her God:    For He stands in the midst of His people:      Glory, and honor, and power, and might,    Be ascribed to our God; for He is full of mercy,    Justice, grace and truth, and peace,    For ever and ever. Amen.    {XLVI} It should be remarked, in conclusion, that these peculiarities of  scope, structure, phraseology, re-appearance of principles, texture of  composition and the like, which identify this revelation on marriage  as the composition of Joseph Smith (under the inspiration of the Lord,  of course) are not forced into the revelation. Its composition gives  no evidence of being a conglomerate of Joseph Smith's thought-gems  held together by some one else's clay. It is all of one piece, it is  not patch work. Unity above all things is characteristic of it. Words,  phrases, sentences, ideas all blend together, preserving strict unity  of style and that style Joseph Smith's. No one else could have written  it. The literary peculiarities of that revelation as readily proclaim  it to be Joseph Smith's composition to those familiar with his literary  style, as the contour of his face, the form of his features, the color  of his hair and eyes, the tint of his complexion, the intonation of his  voice, together with his form and bearing would reveal his physical  personality to those who familiarly knew him in life. There will be no  doubt whatever as to Joseph Smith being the author of it in the minds  of those who will give it literary analysis. Whatever has come of it,  or whatever may come of it in the future, Joseph Smith is the author  of that revelation, and is responsible before God and the world for  the introduction of that marriage law into the Church--the law that  contemplates marriage as an eternal union, and the rightfulness of a  plurality of wives under certain conditions and divine sanctions, when  permissible under the laws of the land and the law of the Church.
