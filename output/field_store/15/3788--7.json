The  opossum (_Didelphis marsupialis_), common on the Reservation,  occasionally eats voles (Sandidge, 1953:99-101). Other mammals which are  probably important predators on voles on the Reservation, though no  specific information is available, are the striped skunk (_Mephitis  mephitis_), spotted skunk (_Spilogale putorius_), weasel (_Mustela  frenata_) and the red fox (_Vulpes fulva_). Eadie (1944; 1948; 1952),  Shapiro (1950:360) and others have reported that the short-tailed shrew  (_Blarina brevicauda_) was an important predator on _Microtus_. Shrews  were present on the Reservation but were not trapped often enough to  permit study.    The variety of vertebrates preying on voles suggests that they occupy a  position of importance in many food chains. Errington (1935:199) and  McAtee (1935:4) refer to voles as staple items of prey for all classes  of predatory vertebrates. An attempt to evaluate prey species was made  by Wooster (1939). He proposed a formula which involved multiplying the  density of a species, its mean individual weight, the fraction of the  day it was active and the fraction of the year it was active to give a  numerical index of prey value. Although his methods of determining  population densities would now be considered questionable, the purpose  of his investigation merits further consideration. He reported _M.  ochrogaster_ to be second only to the jack-rabbit (_Lepus californicus_)  as a prey species in west-central Kansas.          MAMMALIAN ASSOCIATES      In the course of live-trapping operations several species of small  mammals other than _Microtus ochrogaster_ were taken in the traps. Also,  from time to time, direct observations of certain mammals were made and  various types of sign of larger mammals were noted. These records gave a  picture of the mammalian community of which the voles were a part. The  three associated species which were most commonly trapped were _Sigmodon  hispidus_, _Reithrodontomys megalotis_ and _Peromyscus leucopus_. These  three species have been commonly found associated with _Microtus_ in  this part of the country (Fisher, 1945:435; Jameson, 1947:137).    The Texas cotton rat, _Sigmodon hispidus_, was the most commonly trapped  associate of the voles between November, 1950, and February, 1952.  Although a greater number of individuals of the harvest mouse were taken  in a few months, the cotton rat had a greater ecological importance  because of its larger size (Figs. 17, 18, 19). The cotton rat was an  especially noteworthy member of the community for two reasons. It has  arrived in northern Kansas only recently and its progressive range  extension northward and westward has attracted the attention of many  mammalogists (Bailey, 1902:107; Cockrum, 1948; 1952:183-187; Rinker,  1942b). Secondly, _Sigmodon_ has long been considered to be almost the  ecological equivalent of _Microtus_ and to replace the vole in the  southern United States (Calhoun, 1945:251; Svihla, 1929:353). Since the  two species are now found together over large parts of Kansas their  relationships in the state need careful study.    [Illustration: FIG. 17. Variations in density and mass of three common  rodents on House Field. The upper graph shows the sum of the biomass of  the three rodents. In the two lower graphs the solid line represents  _Microtus_, the broken line _Sigmodon_, and the dotted line  _Reithrodontomys_.]    [Illustration: FIG. 18. Variations in density and biomass of three  common rodents on Quarry Field. For key, see legend of Fig. 17.]    [Illustration: FIG. 19. Changing biomass ratios of three common rodents  on House Field and Quarry Field. In late 1951 and early 1952 the cotton  rats attained relatively high levels and seemingly caused compensatory  decreases in the numbers of voles. The solid line represents _Microtus_,  the broken line _Sigmodon_, and the dotted line _Reithrodontomys_.]    Both this study and the literature (Black, 1937:197; Calhoun, _loc.  cit._; Meyer and Meyer, 1944:108; Phillips, 1936:678; Rinker, 1942a:377;  Strecker, 1929:216-218; Svihla, 1929:352-353) showed that, in general,  the habitat needs of _Microtus_ and _Sigmodon_ were similar. Studies on  the Natural History Reservation, both in connection with my problem and  otherwise, suggested, however, that _Sigmodon_ occurred in only the more  productive habitat types used by voles, where the vegetation was  relatively high and rank. On the Reservation the cotton rat was found  mostly in the lower meadows; they were more moist and had a more  luxuriant vegetation than the higher fields. Although a few cotton rats  were taken in Quarry Field and still fewer in Reithro Field, the  population of those hilltop areas did not approach, at any time, the  levels reached on House Field, which produced a more luxuriant cover.  Only when the levels of population were exceptionally high did the  cotton rats spread into less productive habitats. At all times, there  were areas on the Reservation used by _Microtus_ which could not support  a population of _Sigmodon_.    The cotton rats reacted differently to the floods of July, 1951, than  did the voles. Although the population of the cotton rat decreased  slightly immediately after the wet period, this decrease was  insignificant when compared with the drop in population level of other  species of small mammals on the same area. During the autumn of 1951 and  until March, 1952, the cotton rat became the most important mammal on  the House Field study area in terms of grams per acre (Fig. 17),  although the number of cotton rats per acre never matched the density of  the voles. A similar, though less pronounced, trend was observed on the  Quarry Field study area (Fig. 18). One factor in the success of the  cotton rat at this time seemed to be the greater resistance to wetting  shown by very young individuals. Few adults (of any species) marked  before the heavy rains of July, 1951, were trapped in September, 1951,  when trapping was resumed after a lapse of one month. Several subadults  and some juvenal cotton rats did survive, however, and provided a  breeding population from which the area was repopulated. Cotton rats are  born fully furred and able to move well, and are often weaned at ten  days (Meyer and Meyer, 1944:123-124). Voles, on the other hand, are born  naked and helpless and are often not weaned for three weeks. It seems,  therefore, that extremely wet soil would harm the voles more than it  would the cotton rats.    Several instances of cotton rats eating voles, caught in the same  live-trap, were noted. There is reason to believe that young voles,  unable to leave the nest, are subject to predation by cotton rats. This  would accentuate any competitive advantage gained otherwise by the  cotton rats.    The population of _Sigmodon_ retained its high level, relative to  _Microtus_, until February, 1952. In March only one individual was  captured and after that none was trapped until August, 1952, when a  single subadult male was captured. Early in March, 1952, before the  trapping period for the month had begun, the area suffered three  successive days of unusually low temperature, with snow, which lay more  than six inches deep in places. As suggested by Cockrum (1952:185), such  conditions proved detrimental to the cotton rats and, at least to the  end of the study period in August, 1952, the population of cotton rats  had failed to recover. Perhaps the extremely dry weather which followed  the heavy winter mortality delayed the recovery of the population.    These limited data seem to indicate competition between _Sigmodon_ and  _Microtus_ in Kansas. Extremely wet conditions seem to give _Sigmodon_ a  competitive advantage whereas _Microtus_ is better able to survive dry  summers and severe winters. However, these relationships need further  clarification by an intensive study of the life history of _Sigmodon_ in  Kansas (especially the more arid western part), including its coactions  with the communities it has invaded successfully recently.    The harvest mouse (_Reithrodontomys megalotis_) also was a common  inhabitant of the study plots, but this small rodent seemed not to be a  serious competitor of the voles, as its food consists almost entirely of  seeds (Cockrum, _op. cit._:165) not usually used by voles. In this  study, at least, no conflict over space was apparent. Harvest mice  frequently were taken in the runways of voles and even in the same trap  with voles. Reithro Field, the part of the Reservation having the  heaviest population of the harvest mouse, differed from the habitats  that were better for voles in being higher, drier and less densely  covered with vegetation. However, during the summer of 1951 when the  voles were most abundant, Reithro Field supported a large population of  voles. Estimates of population of the harvest mouse were of doubtful  validity in summer because it was readily trapped only in winter and  early spring. Many individuals marked in late spring were not trapped  again until late autumn although presumably they remained on the area.  This seasonal variation in trapping success seemed to be a matter of  acceptance and refusal of bait (Fitch, 1954:45).    The presence of the wood mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on the study  plots indicated an overlapping of habitats. Both House and Quarry Fields  were on the ecotone between forest and meadow and a mixture of mammals  from both types of habitat occurred. No sign of the homes of the wood  mouse was found on the study plots, and on the larger trap line,  operated by Fitch, wood mice were captured only near the edge of the  woods.    Only six deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) were taken on the study  plots. This small number probably provided an inaccurate index of the  association of the deer mouse and the prairie vole, because samples from  snap-traps and the data of other workers on the Reservation showed a  more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#11)"],[1,"head-men  of all the villages came in, and were given orders about our transport.  Their quaint attitudes of respect and their darkly bronzed faces, that  just showed up in the light, reminded me forcibly of an old Dutch  picture. Some men, too, had been sent from Khamba Dzong for orders and  to know when we should be likely to arrive there. In the course of the  afternoon Dr. Heron and I rode over to a monastery about 3 miles away  where I had been last year, and where I had taken some photographs. Some  prints of these I brought back to the monastery, and the monks were very  pleased with them. They were in the middle of a service when we arrived,  as it was some kind of festival, and the dark temple was illuminated by  hundreds of little butter lamps. The monks were all chanting their  scriptures, and this they continued to do all the afternoon.    On returning to Phari, we found that a message had come from the Jongpen  to ask us to dine with him the following evening. The change in the  climate and the bad cooking had affected the stomachs of all the members  of the Expedition, and none of us was feeling very well. Dr. Kellas was  the worst, and as soon as he arrived at Phari he retired to bed. The  following morning was misty and the ground was all white with  hoar-frost, though it was the last day in May; but as I was anxious to  get some photographs of Chomolhari we rode, with the Chaukidar as a  guide, through the mist across the plain to some hills just to the South  of the great mountain; after a few miles we found ourselves above the  clouds with the sun shining in a brilliant blue sky. The whole of the  Phari Plain was covered by a sea of clouds. On the far side rose the  Pawhunri group of mountains, while further to the South, Kanchenjunga  towered above all the other peaks, such as Siniolchum, Kabru and  Jonsong, all of which stood out very clearly in this brilliant  atmosphere. I rode up a delightful little mountain valley full of dwarf  rhododendrons and Alpine primulas until I reached a height of 16,000  feet. We then left the ponies and climbed on to the top of the hill,  which was about 17,500 feet; from this point we had glorious views of  Chomolhari immediately across the valley, while on the other side we  looked over to the snowy peaks and ranges in Bhutan far to the South of  us. We found the wind very keen at this height, and after taking several  photographs we rode back again to Phari.    [Illustration: CHOMOLHARI FROM THE SOUTH.]    Here I found the place full of troubles. Our Coolie Sirdar was, as we  were beginning to find out, not only useless, but very mischievous, and  he was evidently at the bottom of an attempted mutiny among our coolies,  who refused to go on. The Sirdar strongly objected to our interpreters,  who were preventing him from fleecing us in the matter of stores and  supplies. However, after much talking they were all satisfied. Then it  was the turn of the cooks, all of whom the Sirdar had chosen. I should  not have minded one or two of these going, as they were very bad cooks  and usually drunk, and the fact that all of us had been ill was solely  due to their bad cooking; but I could not let them all go, so it was  necessary to find out which were the most useless, and this we were able  to do in the course of the next few days. Dr. Kellas was getting no  better; he refused to take any food, and was very depressed about  himself. At Phari I was able to change a certain number of our rupees  into Tibetan currency. The then rate of exchange was 33 rupees to 1  sersang--a gold coin--and 41/2 silver trangkas to 1 rupee. The trangkas  were a thin and very badly stamped coin about the size of a two-shilling  piece. We found them, however, to be the most useful form of currency as  the gold coin, though much easier to carry, could only be exchanged at a  few places, and it was seldom that we met people who were rich enough to  be able to change them.    That night four of us went over to have dinner with the Jongpen. First  we were given tea and sweetmeats, followed by strong ginger wine, which  was most comforting to our stomachs in their delicate condition. Then  came dishes of mutton in varying forms with vegetables and macaroni.  They were all served up in Chinese fashion in little dishes and some  were quite appetising. We were very late in starting the next morning as  all the loads had to be sorted and laid out for the very miscellaneous  transport that had been given us. This consisted of ponies, mules,  donkeys, bullocks and yaks. For riding-animals we were given mules,  which trotted well and covered the ground quite quickly, though some of  the Alpine climbers found them hard to manage and were apt to part  company with their steeds. Our transport was by now becoming rather  complicated as forty-four animals were going right through to Khamba  Dzong and forty-four were being changed at every stage. Dr. Kellas was  not well enough to ride and was carried in an arm-chair all day. Soon  after starting I passed two of our cooks on the road hopelessly drunk,  and left them there. Our way led over the Tang La, a very gentle and  scarcely perceptible pass, 15,200 feet, but important as being the main  Himalayan watershed. All day there was a very strong South wind blowing,  but it was luckily at our backs, and we did not feel it too much. We  then quickly trotted the 10 miles across the absolutely level  Tang-puen-sum Plain. Here I saw several herds of kiang, the wild ass of  Tibet, and got within 50 yards of one lot, but unfortunately the coolie  who was carrying my camera was not up with me at the time. We also  passed a certain number of Tibetan gazelle, but they were all very wary.  The Monsoon clouds came up to the South of us in great rolling billows,  but not a drop of moisture came over the Tang La. Chomolhari was a  magnificent sight all day with its 7,000 feet of precipices descending  sheer into the plain. Tuna (14,800 feet), about 20 miles from Phari, was  our first halt. We were still on the main road to Lhasa and found a  comfortable rest-house into which the eight of us all managed to stow  ourselves. Dr. Kellas, though rather better the next day, was still too  weak to ride, and was carried for the next march on a litter. We were  now in the true Tibetan climate, with brilliant sunshine, blue skies,  still mornings and strong winds all the afternoon.    The next march from Tuna to Dochen was still on the Lhasa Road. I did  not follow the path, but rode with a local man from the village over the  great Tang-puen-sum Plain in search of goa--Tibetan gazelle. We saw many  of them on the plains, but they were the wiliest and most difficult  animals to approach, and in this flat and bare country it was not  possible ever to get within 300 yards of them. As a rule they ran off  when we were still half a mile away. They are restless little creatures,  always on the move, and never at any time an easy mark to hit. I  thoroughly enjoyed this ride over the plains and our glorious views of  Chomolhari and the great snow-covered and glaciated chain to the North  of it along the foot of which we were travelling. A curious pink  trumpet-shaped flower grew in great quantities on the plain; the leaves  were buried under the sand and only the flower showed its head above the  ground. There were also white pincushions of a kind of tiny saxifrage.  This plain, over which we were riding, was evidently once upon a time a  lake bed, as the pebbles were rounded and there were distinct evidences  of former shores along the sides of the hills. Many kiang were grazing  on it and many thousands of sheep were being pastured there. As we  approached the lake called Bamtso, the country became very marshy, and  our ponies got bogged several times. The bungalow at Dochen was situated  near the shores of the Bamtso. Never have I seen a lake with so many  colours in it. It was very shallow, and the shades varied from deep blue  and purple to light green, while in places it was almost red from a weed  that grew in it. Behind it was a background of snow and glacier-covered  mountains, which in the still mornings was reflected faithfully in its  waters and formed a charming picture. Swimming on this lake were many  bar-headed geese and Brahminy ducks, and along the shores were many  terns and yellow wagtails.    That evening an amusing thing happened in the kitchen. One of our cooks  was heating up a tin of tinned fish and had put it in some hot water  without previously opening it. When he thought it was sufficiently hot,  he started to open it, with the result that it exploded violently,  covering him and every one else in the kitchen with small pieces of  fish. I was able then to explain to the Tibetans who were carrying our  loads that our stores were very dangerous, and that if any were at any  time stolen, they would be liable to explode and hurt them. It was, of  course, the rarefied air that had caused this, for Dochen is at a height  of 14,700 feet above sea level.    Every day on from now the wind used to blow with great violence all the  afternoon, but would die down after sunset. It must have been of a local  nature caused by the rapid changes from high temperature to low, because  the clouds above at the same time were hardly moving. I sent back Dorje,  one of our cooks, from this place, as it was the fourth time that he had  been drunk, and this I hoped would be a lesson to the others. We now  left the Lhasa Road and turned off Westwards, having henceforward to  rely on our tents.    [Illustration: LOADING UP AT DOCHEN.]    From Dochen to Khe was a short march of 11 miles over the Dug Pass,  16,400 feet. I did not follow the road taken by the transport animals,  but took a local guide and rode over the hill-tops in search of ovis  ammon. I did not see any, however, though we sighted two or three goa,  but they were very wild and would not allow me to approach"]]]
