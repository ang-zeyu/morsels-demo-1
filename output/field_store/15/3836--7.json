Such must be  the science of every living and progressive reality; such social  science indisputably is.    It may be, then, that political economy, in spite of its  individualistic tendency and its exclusive affirmations, is a  constituent part of social science, in which the phenomena that  it describes are like the starting-points of a vast  triangulation and the elements of an organic and complex whole.  From this point of view, the progress of humanity, proceeding  from the simple to the complex, would be entirely in harmony with  the progress of science; and the conflicting and so often  desolating facts, which are today the basis and object of  political economy, would have to be considered by us as so  many special hypotheses, successively realized by humanity in  view of a superior hypothesis, whose realization would solve all  difficulties, and satisfy socialism without destroying political  economy.  For, as I said in my introduction, in no case can we  admit that humanity, however it expresses itself, is mistaken.    Let us now make this clearer by facts.    The question now most disputed is unquestionably that of the  ORGANIZATION OF LABOR.    As John the Baptist preached in the desert, REPENT YE, so the  socialists go about proclaiming everywhere this novelty old as  the world, ORGANIZE LABOR, though never able to tell what, in  their opinion, this organization should be.  However that may be,  the economists have seen that this socialistic clamor was  damaging their theories: it was, indeed, a rebuke to them for  ignoring that which they ought first to recognize,--labor.  They  have replied, therefore, to the attack of their adversaries,  first by maintaining that labor is organized, that there is no  other organization of labor than liberty to produce and exchange,  either on one's own personal account, or in association with  others,--in which case the course to be pursued has been  prescribed by the civil and commercial codes.  Then, as this  argument served only to make them the laughing-stock of their  antagonists, they assumed the offensive; and, showing that the  socialists understood nothing at all themselves of this  organization that they held up as a scarecrow, they ended by  saying that it was but a new socialistic chimera, a word without  sense,--an absurdity.  The latest writings of the economists are  full of these pitiless conclusions.    Nevertheless, it is certain that the phrase organization of labor  contains as clear and rational a meaning as these that  follow: organization of the workshop, organization of the  army, organization of police, organization of charity,  organization of war.  In this respect, the argument of the  economists is deplorably irrational.  No less certain is it that  the organization of labor cannot be a utopia and chimera; for at  the moment that labor, the supreme condition of civilization,  begins to exist, it follows that it is already submitted to an  organization, such as it is, which satisfies the economists, but  which the socialists think detestable.    There remains, then, relatively to the proposal to organize labor  formulated by socialism, this objection,--that labor is  organized.  Now, this is utterly untenable, since it is notorious  that in labor, supply, demand, division, quantity, proportion,  price, and security, nothing, absolutely nothing is regulated; on  the contrary, everything is given up to the caprices of  free-will; that is, to chance.    As for us, guided by the idea that we have formed of social  science, we shall affirm, against the socialists and against the  economists, not that labor MUST BE ORGANIZED, nor that it is  ORGANIZED but that it IS BEING ORGANIZED.    Labor, we say, is being organized: that is, the process of  organization has been going on from the beginning of the world,  and will continue till the end.  Political economy teaches us the  primary elements of this organization; but socialism is right in  asserting that, in its present form, the organization is  inadequate and transitory; and the whole mission of science is  continually to ascertain, in view of the results obtained and the  phenomena in course of development, what innovations can be  immediately effected.    Socialism and political economy, then, while waging a burlesque  war, pursue in reality the same idea,--the organization of labor.    But both are guilty of disloyalty to science and of mutual  calumny, when on the one hand political economy, mistaking for  science its scraps of theory, denies the possibility of further  progress; and when socialism, abandoning tradition, aims at  reestablishing society on undiscoverable bases.    Thus socialism is nothing but a profound criticism and continual  development of political economy; and, to apply here the  celebrated aphorism of the school, Nihil est in intellectu, quod  non prius fuerit in sensu, there is nothing in the socialistic  hypotheses which is not duplicated in economic practice.  On the  other hand, political economy is but an impertinent rhapsody, so  long as it affirms as absolutely valid the facts collected by  Adam Smith and J. B. Say.    Another question, no less disputed than the preceding one, is  that of usury, or lending at interest.    Usury, or in other words the price of use, is the emolument, of  whatever nature, which the proprietor derives from the loan of  his property.  Quidquid sorti accrescit usura est, say the  theologians.  Usury, the foundation of credit, was one of the  first of the means which social spontaneity employed in its work  of organization, and whose analysis discloses the profound laws  of civilization.  The ancient philosophers and the Fathers of the  Church, who must be regarded here as the representatives of  socialism in the early centuries of the Christian era, by a  singular fallacy,--which arose however from the paucity of  economic knowledge in their day,--allowed farm-rent and condemned  interest on money, because, as they believed, money was  unproductive.  They distinguished consequently between the loan  of things which are consumed by use--among which they included  money--and the loan of things which, without being consumed,  yield a product to the user.    The economists had no difficulty in showing, by generalizing the  idea of rent, that in the economy of society the action of  capital, or its productivity, was the same whether it was  consumed in wages or retained the character of an instrument;  that, consequently, it was necessary either to prohibit the rent  of land or to allow interest on money, since both were by the  same title payment for privilege, indemnity for loan.  It  required more than fifteen centuries to get this idea accepted,  and to reassure the consciences that had been terrified by the  anathemas pronounced by Catholicism against usury.  But finally  the weight of evidence and the general desire favored the  usurers: they won the battle against socialism; and from this  legitimation of usury society gained some immense and  unquestionable advantages.  Under these circumstances socialism,  which had tried to generalize the law enacted by Moses for the  Israelites alone, Non foeneraberis proximo tuo, sed alieno, was  beaten by an idea which it had accepted from the economic  routine,-- namely, farm-rent,--elevated into the theory of the  productivity of capital.    But the economists in their turn were less fortunate, when they  were afterwards called upon to justify farm-rent in itself, and  to establish this theory of the product of capital.  It may be  said that, on this point, they have lost all the advantage they  had at first gained against socialism.    Undoubtedly--and I am the first to recognize it--the rent of  land, like that of money and all personal and real property, is a  spontaneous and universal fact, which has its source in the  depths of our nature, and which soon becomes, by its natural  development, one of the most potent means of organization.  I  shall prove even that interest on capital is but the  materialization of the aphorism, ALL LABOR SHOULD LEAVE AN  EXCESS.  But in the face of this theory, or rather this fiction,  of the productivity of capital, arises another thesis no less  certain, which in these latter days has struck the ablest  economists: it is that all value is born of labor, and is  composed essentially of wages; in other words, that no wealth has  its origin in privilege, or acquires any value except through  work; and that, consequently, labor alone is the source of  revenue among men.  How, then, reconcile the theory of farm-rent  or productivity of capital--a theory confirmed by universal  custom, which conservative political economy is forced to accept  but cannot justify--with this other theory which shows that value  is normally composed of wages, and which inevitably ends, as we  shall demonstrate, in an equality in society between net product  and raw product?    The socialists have not wasted the opportunity.  Starting with  the principle that labor is the source of all income, they began  to call the holders of capital to account for their farm-rents  and emoluments; and, as the economists won the first victory by  generalizing under a common expression farm-rent and usury, so  the socialists have taken their revenge by causing the seignorial  rights of capital to vanish before the still more general  principle of labor.  Property has been demolished from top to  bottom: the economists could only keep silent; but, powerless to  arrest itself in this new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],[0,"The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#11)"],[1,"the people of the Territory, except only in       case he should be called upon by the Governor for soldiers to       act as a _posse comitatus_ in enforcing obedience to the laws.         \"In conformity with this sentiment, and to assure these people       of the real intention of the movement, an active, discreet       officer was sent in advance of the army to Utah, for the       purpose of purchasing provisions for it, and of assuring the       people of the Territory of the peaceful intentions of the       Government. This officer found, upon entering the Territory,       that these deluded people had already, in advance of his       arrival, or of any information, except as to the march of the       column, determined to resist their approach, and prevent, if       possible, and by force, the entrance of the army into the       Valley of Salt Lake. Supplies of every sort were refused him.         \"The day after his departure from the city, on his way back,       Brigham issued his Proclamation, substantially declaring war       against the United States, and at the same time putting the       Territory under martial law.\"    The following is a copy of this celebrated document:--           \"PROCLAMATION         \"OF GOVERNOR BRIGHAM YOUNG.         \"_Citizens of Utah_,--We are invaded by a hostile force, who       are evidently assailing us to accomplish our overthrow and       destruction.

Our houses have been       plundered and then burned, our fields laid waste, our       principal men butchered, while under the pledged faith of the       Government for their safety; and our families driven from       their homes, to find that shelter in the barren wilderness,       and that protection among hostile savages, which were denied       them in the boasted abodes of Christianity and civilization.         \"The Constitution of our common country guarantees unto us all       that we do now, or have ever claimed.

We       are condemned unheard, and forced to an issue with an armed,       mercenary mob, which has been sent against us at the       instigation of anonymous letter-writers, ashamed to father the       base, slanderous falsehoods which they have given to the       public; of corrupt officials, who have brought false       accusations against us, to screen themselves in their own       infamy; and of hireling priests and howling editors, who       prostitute the truth for filthy lucre's sake.         \"The issue which has thus been forced upon us compels us to       resort to the first great law of self-preservation, and stand       in our own self-defence,--a right guaranteed to us by the       genius of the institutions of our country, and upon which the       Government is based. Our duty to ourselves--to our       families--requires us not to tamely submit to be driven and       slain, without an attempt to preserve ourselves. Our duty to       our country--our holy religion--our God--to freedom and       liberty, requires that we should not quietly stand still, and       see those fetters forging around us, which are calculated to       enslave and bring us in subjection to an unlawful military       despotism, such as can only emanate, in a country of       constitutional law, from usurpation, tyranny, and oppression.         \"Therefore, I, Brigham Young, Governor and Superintendent of       Indian Affairs for the Territory of Utah, in the name of the       people of the United States in the Territory of Utah,       forbid,--         \"_First._ All armed forces, of whatever description, from       coming into this Territory, under any pretence whatever.         \"_Second._ That all the forces in said Territory hold       themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice, to       repel any and all such invasion.         \"_Third._ Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this       Territory, from and after the publication of this       proclamation; and no person shall be allowed to pass or       repass, into, or through, or from this Territory, without a       permit from the proper officer.         \"Given under my hand and seal, at Great Salt Lake City,       Territory of Utah, this fifteenth day of September, A.
