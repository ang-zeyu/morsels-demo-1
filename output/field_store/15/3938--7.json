When he spoke, the efforts of the professor  (professor of divinity though he was) were totally inadequate to restrain  the inextinguishable laughter of the students, and sometimes even to  repress his own. The long, sallow visage, the goggle eyes, the huge  under-jaw, which appeared not to open and shut by an act of volition, but  to be dropped and hoisted up again by some complicated machinery within  the inner man, the harsh and dissonant voice, and the screech-owl notes  to which it was exalted when he was exhorted to pronounce more  distinctly,--all added fresh subject for mirth to the torn cloak and  shattered shoe, which have afforded legitimate subjects of raillery  against the poor scholar from Juvenal's time downward. It was never known  that Sampson either exhibited irritability at this ill usage, or made the  least attempt to retort upon his tormentors. He slunk from college by the  most secret paths he could discover, and plunged himself into his  miserable lodging, where, for eighteenpence a week, he was allowed the  benefit of a straw mattress, and, if his landlady was in good humour,  permission to study his task by her fire. Under all these disadvantages,  he obtained a competent knowledge of Greek and Latin, and some  acquaintance with the sciences.    In progress of time, Abel Sampson, probationer of divinity, was admitted  to the privileges of a preacher. But, alas! partly from his own  bashfulness, partly owing to a strong and obvious disposition to  risibility which pervaded the congregation upon his first attempt, he  became totally incapable of proceeding in his intended discourse, gasped,  grinned, hideously rolled his eyes till the congregation thought them  flying out of his head, shut the Bible, stumbled down the pulpit-stairs,  trampling upon the old women who generally take their station there, and  was ever after designated as a 'stickit minister.' And thus he wandered  back to his own country, with blighted hopes and prospects, to share the  poverty of his parents. As he had neither friend nor confidant, hardly  even an acquaintance, no one had the means of observing closely how  Dominie Sampson bore a disappointment which supplied the whole town with  a week's sport. It would be endless even to mention the numerous jokes to  which it gave birth, from a ballad called 'Sampson's Riddle,' written  upon the subject by a smart young student of humanity, to the sly hope of  the Principal that the fugitive had not, in imitation of his mighty  namesake, taken the college gates along with him in his retreat.    To all appearance, the equanimity of Sampson was unshaken. He sought to  assist his parents by teaching a school, and soon had plenty of scholars,  but very few fees. In fact, he taught the sons of farmers for what they  chose to give him, and the poor for nothing; and, to the shame of the  former be it spoken, the pedagogue's gains never equalled those of a  skilful ploughman. He wrote, however, a good hand, and added something to  his pittance by copying accounts and writing letters for Ellangowan. By  degrees, the Laird, who was much estranged from general society, became  partial to that of Dominie Sampson. Conversation, it is true, was out of  the question, but the Dominie was a good listener, and stirred the fire  with some address. He attempted even to snuff the candles, but was  unsuccessful, and relinquished that ambitious post of courtesy after  having twice reduced the parlour to total darkness. So his civilities,  thereafter, were confined to taking off his glass of ale in exactly the  same time and measure with the Laird, and in uttering certain indistinct  murmurs of acquiescence at the conclusion of the long and winding stories  of Ellangowan.    On one of these occasions, he presented for the first time to Mannering  his tall, gaunt, awkward, bony figure, attired in a threadbare suit of  black, with a coloured handkerchief, not over clean, about his sinewy,  scraggy neck, and his nether person arrayed in grey breeches, dark-blue  stockings, clouted shoes, and small copper buckles.    Such is a brief outline of the lives and fortunes of those two persons in  whose society Mannering now found himself comfortably seated.              CHAPTER  III       Do not the hist'ries of all ages       Relate miraculous presages       Of strange turns in the world's affairs,       Foreseen by astrologers, soothsayers,       Chaldeans, learned genethliacs,       And some that have writ almanacks?              Hudibras.      The circumstances of the landlady were pleaded to Mannering, first, as an  apology for her not appearing to welcome her guest, and for those  deficiencies in his entertainment which her attention might have  supplied, and then as an excuse for pressing an extra bottle of good  wine. 'I cannot weel sleep,' said the Laird, with the anxious feelings of  a father in such a predicament, 'till I hear she's gotten ower with it;  and if you, sir, are not very sleepery, and would do me and the Dominie  the honour to sit up wi' us, I am sure we shall not detain you very late.  Luckie Howatson is very expeditious. There was ance a lass that was in  that way; she did not live far from hereabouts--ye needna shake your head  and groan, Dominie; I am sure the kirk dues were a' weel paid, and what  can man do mair?--it was laid till her ere she had a sark ower her head;  and the man that she since wadded does not think her a pin the waur for  the misfortune. They live, Mr. Mannering, by the shoreside at Annan, and  a mair decent, orderly couple, with six as fine bairns as ye would wish  to see plash in a saltwater dub; and little curlie Godfrey--that's the  eldest, the come o' will, as I may say--he's on board an excise yacht. I  hae a cousin at the board of excise; that's Commissioner Bertram; he got  his commissionership in the great contest for the county, that ye must  have heard of, for it was appealed to the House of Commons. Now I should  have voted there for the Laird of Balruddery; but ye see my father was a  Jacobite, and out with Kenmore, so he never took the oaths; and I ken not  weel how it was, but all that I could do and say, they keepit me off the  roll, though my agent, that had a vote upon my estate, ranked as a good  vote for auld Sir Thomas Kittlecourt. But, to return to what I was  saying, Luckie Howatson is very expeditious, for this lass--'    Here the desultory and long-winded narrative of the Laird was interrupted  by the voice of some one ascending the stairs from the kitchen story, and  singing at full pitch of voice. The high notes were too shrill for a man,  the low seemed too deep for a woman. The words, as far as Mannering could  distinguish them, seemed to run thus:--        Canny moment, lucky fit!      Is the lady lighter yet?      Be it lad, or be it lass,      Sign wi' cross and sain wi' mass.    'It's Meg Merrilies, the gipsy, as sure as I am a sinner,' said Mr.  Bertram. The Dominie groaned deeply, uncrossed his legs, drew in the huge  splay foot which his former posture had extended, placed it  perpendicularly, and stretched the other limb over it instead, puffing  out between whiles huge volumes of tobacco smoke. 'What needs ye groan,  Dominie? I am sure Meg's sangs do nae ill.'    'Nor good neither,' answered Dominie Sampson, in a voice whose untuneable  harshness corresponded with the awkwardness of his figure. They were the  first words which Mannering had heard him speak; and as he had been  watching with some curiosity when this eating, drinking, moving, and  smoking automaton would perform the part of speaking, he was a good deal  diverted with the harsh timber tones which issued from him. But at this  moment the door opened, and Meg Merrilies entered.    Her appearance made Mannering start. She was full six feet high, wore a  man's great-coat over the rest of her dress, had in her hand a goodly  sloethorn cudgel, and in all points of equipment, except her petticoats,  seemed rather masculine than feminine. Her dark elf-locks shot out like  the snakes of the gorgon between an old-fashioned bonnet called a  bongrace, heightening the singular effect of her strong and  weather-beaten features, which they partly shadowed, while her eye had a  wild roll that indicated something like real or affected insanity.    'Aweel, Ellangowan,' she said, 'wad it no hae been a bonnie thing, an the  leddy had been brought to bed, and me at the fair o' Drumshourloch, no  kenning, nor dreaming a word about it? Wha was to hae keepit awa the  worriecows, I trow? Ay, and the elves and gyre-carlings frae the bonnie  bairn, grace be wi' it? Ay, or said Saint Colme's charm for its sake, the  dear?' And without waiting an answer she began to sing--         Trefoil, vervain, John's-wort, dill,       Hinders witches of their       will, Weel is them, that weel may       Fast upon Saint Andrew's day.         Saint Bride and her brat,       Saint Colme and his cat,       Saint Michael and his spear,       Keep the house frae reif and wear.    This charm she sung to a wild tune, in a high and shrill voice, and,  cutting three capers with such strength and agility as almost to touch  the roof of the room, concluded, 'And now, Laird, will ye no order me a  tass o' brandy?'    'That you shall have, Meg. Sit down yont there at the door and tell us  what news ye have heard at the fair o' Drumshourloch.'    'Troth, Laird, and there was muckle want o' you, and the like o' you; for  there was a whin bonnie lasses there, forbye mysell, and deil ane to gie  them hansels.'    'Weel, Meg, and how mony gipsies were sent to the tolbooth?'    'Troth, but three, Laird, for there were nae mair in the fair, bye  mysell, as I said before,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60198"],[0,"Fuente Ovejuna (#11)"],[1," averiguar,    o los has de perdonar,    o matar la villa toda.
