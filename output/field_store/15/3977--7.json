[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6971"],[0,"Judaism (#11)"],[1," O Lord my God and God of my fathers, Sovereign of all works,  Lord of all souls! Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto  dead bodies.' The last phrase is also extant in another reading in the  Talmud and in some liturgies: 'Blessed art Thou, who revivest the dead,'  but the meaning of the two forms is identical. This passage, be it noted,  is ancient, and is recited every morning at prayer. The second passage is  recited even more frequently, for it is said thrice daily, and also forms  part of the funeral service. It may be found in the Prayer Book just  quoted on p. 44: 'Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, Thou quickenest  the dead, Thou art mighty to save. Thou sustainest the living with  loving-kindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the  falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest Thy faith to  them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto Thee, Lord of mighty acts,  and who resembleth Thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest  salvation to spring forth? Yea faithful art Thou to quicken the dead.'    The later history of the doctrine in the Synagogue may be best summarised  in the words of Dr. Kohler, whose theological articles in the _Jewish  Encyclopedia_ deserve grateful recognition. What follows may be  read at full length in that work, vol. vi. p. 567: 'While mediaeval  philosophy dwelt on the intellectual, moral, or spiritual nature of the  soul to prove its immortality, the Cabbalists endeavoured to explain the  soul as a light from heaven, after Proverbs xx. 27, and immortality as  a return to the celestial world of pure light. But the belief in the  pre-existence of the soul led the mystics to the adoption, with all  its weird notions and superstitions, of the Pythagorean system of the  transmigration of the soul.' Moses Mendelssohn revived the Platonic form  of the doctrine of immortality. Thenceforth the dogma of the Resurrection  was gradually discarded until it was eliminated from the Prayer Book of  the Reform congregations. Man's future was thought of as the realisation  of those 'higher expectations which are sown, as part of its very nature,  in every human soul.' The statement of Genesis that 'God made man in  His own image,' and the idea conveyed in the text (1 Samuel xxv. 29),  'May the soul ... be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord thy  God,' which as a divine promise and a human supplication 'filled the  generations with comfort and hope, received a new meaning from this view  of man's future; and the Rabbinical saying (Ber. 64 a): \"The Righteous  rest not, either in this or in the future world, but go from strength  to strength until they see God in Zion,\" appeared to offer an endless  vista to the hope of immortality.'    But quite apart from this indefiniteness of attitude as to the meaning  of immortality, it is scarcely possible to speak of a Jewish Eschatology  at all. The development of an Eschatology occurred in that section of  Jewish opinion which remained on the fringe. It must be sought in the  apocalyptic literature, which has been preserved in Greek. The whole  subject had but a small attraction for Judaism proper. Naturally there  was some curiosity and some speculation. The Day of the Lord, with its  combination of Retribution and Salvation, was pictured in various ways  and with some elaboration of detail. Paradise and Hell were mapped out,  and the comfortable compartments to be occupied by the saints and the  miserable quarters of sinners were specified with the precision of an  Ordnance Survey. Purgatory was an institution not limited to the Roman  Catholic Church; it had a strong hold on the mediaeval Jewish mind. The  intermediate state was a favourite escape from the theological necessity  of condemning sinners to eternal punishment. The Jewish heart could  not suffer the pain of conceiving Gehenna inevitable. So, one by one,  those who might logically be committed there were rescued on various  pretexts. In the end the number of the individual sinners who were to  suffer eternal torture could be named on the fingers of one hand.    By the preceding paragraph it is not implied that Jewish literature in  Hebrew has not its full complement of fancies, horrible and beautiful,  regarding heaven and hell. But such fancies were neither dogmatic  nor popular. They never found their way into the tenets of Judaism as  formulated by any authority; they never became a moving power in the life  of the Jewish masses. It was the poets who nourished these lurid ideas,  and poetry which has done so much for the good of religion has also done  it many a disservice. Judaism, in its prosaic form, accepted the ideas  of Immortality, Retribution, and so forth, but the real interest was in  life here, not in life hereafter.    We can see how the two were bridged over by the Jewish conviction of  human solidarity. For twelve months after the death of a father the son  recited daily the Kaddish prayer (_Authorised Daily Prayer Book_,  p. 77). This was a mere Doxology, opening: 'Magnified and sanctified  be His great name in the world which He hath created according to His  will. May He establish His kingdom during your life and during your days,  and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a  near time, and say ye Amen.' As to the Messianic idea of the Kingdom of  God, something will be said in the next chapter. But this Doxology was  believed efficacious to save the departed soul when uttered by the living  son. The generations were thus bound together, and just as the merits of  the fathers could exert benign influence over the erring child on earth,  so could the praises of the child move the mercy of God in favour of  the erring father in Purgatory. It was a beautiful expression of the  unbreakable chain of tradition, a tradition whose links were human  hearts. In such conceptions, rather than in descriptive pictures of  Paradise and Gehenna, is the true mind of Judaism to be discerned.    That the first formal sign of grief at the death of a parent should be a  Doxology will not have escaped notice. God is the Righteous Judge. Thus,  in the Eschatology of Judaism, this idea of Judgment predominates. A  favourite passage was the Mishnic utterance (second century): 'Rabbi  Eleazar said: They that are born are destined to die, and they that  die to be brought to life again, and they that live to be judged.'  (Aboth, iv. 29). But in another sense, too, there was judgment at  death. The sorrow of the survivors, like the decease of the departed,  was to be considered as God's doing, and therefore right. Hence in the  very moment of the death of a loved one, when grief was most poignant,  the survivor stood forth before the congregation and praised God. And so  the Burial Service is named in Hebrew 'Zidduk Ha-din,' _i.e._ 'The  Justification of the Judgment.' A few sentences in it ran thus (_Prayer  Book_, p. 318): 'The Rock, His work is perfect.... He ruleth below and  above, He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up again.... Blessed be  the true Judge.' And perhaps more than all attempts to analyse beliefs  and dogmas, the following prayer, recited during the week of mourning  for the dead, will convey to the reader the real attitude of Judaism  (at least in its central variety) to some of the questions which have  occupied us in this chapter. The quotation is made from p. 323 of the  same Prayer Book that has been already cited several times above:    'O Lord and King, who art full of compassion, in whose hand is the soul  of every living thing and the breath of all flesh, who killest and makest  alive, who bringest down to the grave and bringest up again, receive,  we beseech Thee, in Thy great loving-kindness, the soul of our brother  who hath been gathered unto his people. Have mercy upon him, pardon all  his transgressions, for there is not a righteous man upon earth, who  doeth good and sinneth not. Remember unto him the righteousness which  he wrought, and let his reward be with him and his recompense before  him. O shelter his soul in the shadow of Thy wings. Make known to Him the  path of life: in Thy presence is fulness of joy; at Thy right hand are  pleasures for evermore. Vouchsafe unto him of the abounding happiness  that is treasured up for the righteous, as it is written, Oh how great  is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which  Thou hast wrought for them that trust in Thee before the children of men!    'O Lord, who healest the broken-hearted and bindest up their wounds,  grant Thy consolation unto the mourners: put into their hearts the  fear and love of Thee, that they may serve Thee with a perfect heart,  and let their latter end be peace.    'Like one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and in  Jerusalem shall ye be comforted. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither  shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting  light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.    'He will destroy death for ever; and the Lord will wipe away tears from  off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off  all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.'        CHAPTER VIII    THE SURVIVAL OF JUDAISM      The Messianic Hope has an intimate connection with Eschatology. Whereas,  however, the latter in so far as it affirmed a Resurrection conceived  of the immortality of Israelites, the former conceived the Immortality  of Israel. It is not necessary here to trace the origin and history of  the Messianic idea in Judaism. That this idea had a strong nationalistic  tinge is obvious. The Messiah was to be a person of Davidic descent,  who would be the restorer of Israel's greatness. Throughout Jewish  history, despite the constant injunction to refrain 'from calculating  the date of the end,' men have arisen who have claimed to be Messiahs,  and these have mostly asserted their claim on nationalistic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6980"],[0,"Tales of St. Austin's (#11)"],[1,"1_    'Might I observe, sir--'    'You may observe whatever you like,' said the referee kindly.  'Twenty-five.'    'The rules say--'    'I have given my decision. Twenty-_five_!' A spot of red appeared  on the official cheek. The referee, who had been heckled since the  kick-off, was beginning to be annoyed.    'The ball went behind without bouncing, and the rules say--'    'Twenty-FIVE!!' shouted the referee. 'I am perfectly well aware what  the rules say.' And he blew his whistle with an air of finality. The  secretary of the Bargees' F.C. subsided reluctantly, and the game was  restarted.    The Bargees' match was a curious institution. Their real name was the  Old Crockfordians. When, a few years before, the St Austin's secretary  had received a challenge from them, dated from Stapleton, where their  secretary happened to reside, he had argued within himself as follows:  'This sounds all right. Old Crockfordians? Never heard of Crockford.  Probably some large private school somewhere. Anyhow, they're certain  to be decent fellows.' And he arranged the fixture. It then transpired  that Old Crockford was a village, and, from the appearance of the team  on the day of battle, the Old Crockfordians seemed to be composed  exclusively of the riff-raff of same. They wore green shirts with a  bright yellow leopard over the heart, and C.F.C. woven in large letters  about the chest. One or two of the outsides played in caps, and the  team to a man criticized the referee's decisions with point and  pungency. Unluckily, the first year saw a weak team of Austinians  rather badly beaten, with the result that it became a point of honour  to wipe this off the slate before the fixture could be cut out of the  card. The next year was also unlucky. The Bargees managed to score a  penalty goal in the first half, and won on that. The match resulted in  a draw in the following season, and by this time the thing had become  an annual event.    Now, however, the School was getting some of its own back. The Bargees  had brought down a player of some reputation from the North, and were  as strong as ever in the scrum. But St Austin's had a great team, and  were carrying all before them. Charteris and Graham at half had the  ball out to their centres in a way which made Merevale, who looked  after the football of the School, feel that life was worth living. And  when once it was out, things happened rapidly. MacArthur, the captain  of the team, with Thomson as his fellow-centre, and Welch and Bannister  on the wings, did what they liked with the Bargees' three-quarters. All  the School outsides had scored, even the back, who dropped a neat goal.  The player from the North had scarcely touched the ball during the  whole game, and altogether the Bargees were becoming restless and  excited.    The kick-off from the twenty-five line which followed upon the small  discussion alluded to above, reached Graham. Under ordinary  circumstances he would have kicked, but in a winning game original  methods often pay. He dodged a furious sportsman in green and yellow,  and went away down the touch-line. He was almost through when he  stumbled. He recovered himself, but too late. Before he could pass,  someone was on him. Graham was not heavy, and his opponent was  muscular. He was swung off his feet, and the next moment the two came  down together, Graham underneath. A sharp pain shot through his  shoulder.    A doctor emerged from the crowd--there is always a doctor in a  crowd--and made an examination.    'Anything bad?' asked the referee.    'Collar-bone,' said the doctor. 'The usual, you know. Rather badly  smashed. Nothing dangerous, of course. Be all right in a month or so.  Stop his playing. Rather a pity. Much longer before half-time?'    'No. I was just going to blow the whistle when this happened.'    The injured warrior was carried off, and the referee blew his whistle  for half-time.    'I say, Charteris,' said MacArthur, 'who the deuce am I to put half  instead of Graham?'    'Rogers used to play half in his childhood, I believe. But, I say, did  you ever see such a scrag? Can't you protest, or something?'    'My dear chap, how can I? It's on our own ground. These Bargee beasts  are visitors, if you come to think of it. I'd like to wring the chap's  neck who did it. I didn't spot who it was. Did you see?'    'Rather. Their secretary. That man with the beard. I'll get Prescott to  mark him this half.'    Prescott was the hardest tackler in the School. He accepted the  commission cheerfully, and promised to do his best by the bearded one.    Charteris certainly gave him every opportunity. When he threw the ball  out of touch, he threw it neatly to the criminal with the beard, and  Prescott, who stuck to him closer than a brother, had generally tackled  him before he knew what had happened. After a time he began to grow  thoughtful, and when there was a line-out went and stood among the  three-quarters. In this way much of Charteris's righteous retribution  miscarried, but once or twice he had the pleasure and privilege of  putting in a piece of tackling on his own account. The match ended with  the enemy still intact, but considerably shaken. He was also rather  annoyed. He spoke to Charteris on the subject as they were leaving the  field.    'I was watching you,' he said, _apropos_ of nothing apparently.    'That must have been nice for you,' said Charteris.    'You wait.'    'Certainly. Any time you're passing, I'm sure--'    'You ain't 'eard the last of me yet.'    'That's something of a blow,' said Charteris cheerfully, and they  parted.    Charteris, having got into his blazer, ran after Welch and MacArthur,  and walked back with them to the House. All three of them were at  Merevale's.    'Poor old Tony,' said MacArthur. 'Where have they taken him to? The  House?'    'Yes,' said Welch. 'I say, Babe, you ought to scratch this match next  year. Tell 'em the card's full up or something.'    'Oh, I don't know. One expects fairly rough play in this sort of game.  After all, we tackle pretty hard ourselves. I know I always try and go  my hardest. If the man happens to be brittle, that's his lookout,'  concluded the bloodthirsty Babe.    'My dear man,' said Charteris, 'there's all the difference between a  decent tackle and a bally scrag like the one that doubled Tony up. You  can't break a chap's collar-bone without trying to.'    'Well, if you come to think of it, I suppose the man must have been  fairly riled. You can't expect a man to be in an angelic temper when  his side's been licked by thirty points.'    The Babe was one of those thoroughly excellent persons who always try,  when possible, to make allowances for everybody.    'Well, dash it,' said Charteris indignantly, 'if he had lost his hair  he might have drawn the line at falling on Tony like that. It wasn't  the tackling part of it that crocked him. The beast simply jumped on  him like a Hooligan. Anyhow, I made him sit up a bit before we  finished. I gave Prescott the tip to mark him out of touch. Have you  ever been collared by Prescott? It's a liberal education. Now, there  you are, you see. Take Prescott. He's never crocked a man seriously in  his life. I don't count being winded. That's absolutely an accident.  Well, there you are, then. Prescott weighs thirteen-ten, and he's all  muscle, and he goes like a battering-ram. You'll own that. He goes as  hard as he jolly well knows how, and yet the worst he has ever done is  to lay a man out for a couple of minutes while he gets his wind back.  Well, compare him with this Bargee man. The Bargee weighs a stone less  and isn't nearly as strong, and yet he smashes Tony's collar-bone. It's  all very well, Babe, but you can't get away from it. Prescott tackles  fairly and the Bargee scrags.'    'Yes,' said MacArthur, 'I suppose you're right.'    'Rather,' said Charteris. 'I wish I'd broken his neck.'    'By the way,' said Welch, 'you were talking to him after the match.  What was he saying?'    Charteris laughed.    'By Jove, I'd forgotten; he said I hadn't heard the last of him, and  that I was to wait.'    'What did you say?'    'Oh, I behaved beautifully. I asked him to be sure and look in any time  he was passing, and after a few chatty remarks we parted.'    'I wonder if he meant anything.'    'I believe he means to waylay me with a buckled belt. I shan't stir out  except with the Old Man or some other competent bodyguard. \"'Orrible  outrage, shocking death of a St Austin's schoolboy.\" It would look  rather well on the posters.'    Welch stuck strenuously to the point.    'No, but, look here, Charteris,' he said seriously, 'I'm not rotting.  You see, the man lives in Stapleton, and if he knows anything of School  rules--'    'Which he doesn't probably. Why should he? Well?'--'If he knows  anything of the rules, he'll know that Stapleton's out of bounds, and  he may book you there and run you in to Merevale.'    'Yes,' said MacArthur. 'I tell you what, you'd do well to knock off a  few of your expeditions to Stapleton. You know you wouldn't go there  once a month if it wasn't out of bounds. You'll be a prefect next term.  I should wait till then, if I were you.'    'My dear chap, what does it matter? The worst that can happen to you  for breaking bounds is a couple of hundred lines, and I've got a  capital of four hundred already in stock. Besides, things would be so  slow if you always kept in bounds. I always feel like a cross between  Dick Turpin and Machiavelli when I go to Stapleton. It's an awfully  jolly feeling. Like warm treacle running down your back. It's cheap at  two hundred lines.'    'You're an awful fool,' said Welch, rudely but correctly.    Welch was a youth who treated the affairs of other people rather too  seriously. He worried over them. This is not a particularly common  trait in the character of either boy or man, but Welch had it highly  developed. He could not probably have explained exactly"]]]
