You see  there was no good in putting it away, for where there was not any  furniture there was no danger of being untidy.    Then she took Irene by the hand, but it was her bad hand and Irene gave  a little cry of pain.  'My child!' said her grandmother, 'what is the  matter?'    Irene held her hand into the moonlight, that the old lady might see it,  and told her all about it, at which she looked grave.  But she only  said: 'Give me your other hand'; and, having led her out upon the  little dark landing, opened the door on the opposite side of it.  What  was Irene's surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her  life!  It was large and lofty, and dome-shaped. From the centre hung a  lamp as round as a ball, shining as if with the brightest moonlight,  which made everything visible in the room, though not so clearly that  the princess could tell what many of the things were.  A large oval bed  stood in the middle, with a coverlid of rose colour, and velvet  curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue.  The walls were also  blue--spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver.    The old lady left her and, going to a strange-looking cabinet, opened  it and took out a curious silver casket.  Then she sat down on a low  chair and, calling Irene, made her kneel before her while she looked at  her hand.  Having examined it, she opened the casket, and took from it  a little ointment.  The sweetest odour filled the room--like that of  roses and lilies--as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot  swollen hand.  Her touch was so pleasant and cool that it seemed to  drive away the pain and heat wherever it came.    'Oh, grandmother! it is so nice!' said Irene.  'Thank you; thank you.'    Then the old lady went to a chest of drawers, and took out a large  handkerchief of gossamer-like cambric, which she tied round her hand.    'I don't think I can let you go away tonight,' she said.  'Would you  like to sleep with me?'    'Oh, yes, yes, dear grandmother,' said Irene, and would have clapped  her hands, forgetting that she could not.    'You won't be afraid, then, to go to bed with such an old woman?'    'No.  You are so beautiful, grandmother.'    'But I am very old.'    'And I suppose I am very young.  You won't mind sleeping with such a  very young woman, grandmother?'    'You sweet little pertness!' said the old lady, and drew her towards  her, and kissed her on the forehead and the cheek and the mouth.  Then  she got a large silver basin, and having poured some water into it made  Irene sit on the chair, and washed her feet. This done, she was ready  for bed.  And oh, what a delicious bed it was into which her  grandmother laid her!  She hardly could have told she was lying upon  anything: she felt nothing but the softness.    The old lady having undressed herself lay down beside her.    'Why don't you put out your moon?' asked the princess.    'That never goes out, night or day,' she answered.  'In the darkest  night, if any of my pigeons are out on a message, they always see my  moon and know where to fly to.'    'But if somebody besides the pigeons were to see it--somebody about the  house, I mean--they would come to look what it was and find you.'    'The better for them, then,' said the old lady.  'But it does not  happen above five times in a hundred years that anyone does see it.    The greater part of those who do take it for a meteor, wink their eyes,  and forget it again.  Besides, nobody could find the room except I  pleased.  Besides, again--I will tell you a secret--if that light were  to go out you would fancy yourself lying in a bare garret, on a heap of  old straw, and would not see one of the pleasant things round about you  all the time.'    'I hope it will never go out,' said the princess.    'I hope not.  But it is time we both went to sleep.  Shall I take you  in my arms?'    The little princess nestled close up to the old lady, who took her in  both her arms and held her close to her bosom.    'Oh, dear! this is so nice!' said the princess.  'I didn't know  anything in the world could be so comfortable.  I should like to lie  here for ever.'    'You may if you will,' said the old lady.  'But I must put you to one  trial-not a very hard one, I hope.  This night week you must come back  to me.  If you don't, I do not know when you may find me again, and you  will soon want me very much.'    'Oh! please, don't let me forget.'    'You shall not forget.  The only question is whether you will believe I  am anywhere--whether you will believe I am anything but a dream.  You  may be sure I will do all I can to help you to come. But it will rest  with yourself, after all.  On the night of next Friday, you must come  to me.  Mind now.'    'I will try,' said the princess.    'Then good night,' said the old lady, and kissed the forehead which lay  in her bosom.    In a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the  loveliest dreams--of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and  great murmuring trees, and beds of wild flowers with such odours as she  had never smelled before.  But, after all, no dream could be more  lovely than what she had left behind when she fell asleep.    In the morning she found herself in her own bed.  There was no  handkerchief or anything else on her hand, only a sweet odour lingered  about it.  The swelling had all gone down; the prick of the brooch had  vanished--in fact, her hand was perfectly well.        CHAPTER 12    A Short Chapter About Curdie    Curdie spent many nights in the mine.  His father and he had taken Mrs.  Peterson into the secret, for they knew mother could hold her tongue,  which was more than could be said of all the miners' wives.    But Curdie did not tell her that every night he spent in the mine, part  of it went in earning a new red petticoat for her.    Mrs. Peterson was such a nice good mother!  All mothers are nice and  good more or less, but Mrs. Peterson was nice and good all more and no  less.  She made and kept a little heaven in that poor cottage on the  high hillside for her husband and son to go home to out of the low and  rather dreary earth in which they worked.  I doubt if the princess was  very much happier even in the arms of her huge great-grandmother than  Peter and Curdie were in the arms of Mrs. Peterson.  True, her hands  were hard and chapped and large, but it was with work for them; and  therefore, in the sight of the angels, her hands were so much the more  beautiful.  And if Curdie worked hard to get her a petticoat, she  worked hard every day to get him comforts which he would have missed  much more than she would a new petticoat even in winter.  Not that she  and Curdie ever thought of how much they worked for each other: that  would have spoiled everything.    When left alone in the mine Curdie always worked on for an hour or two  at first, following the lode which, according to Glump, would lead at  last into the deserted habitation.  After that, he would set out on a  reconnoitring expedition.  In order to manage this, or rather the  return from it, better than the first time, he had bought a huge ball  of fine string, having learned the trick from Hop-o'-my-Thumb, whose  history his mother had often told him.  Not that Hop-o'-my-Thumb had  ever used a ball of string--I should be sorry to be supposed so far out  in my classics--but the principle was the same as that of the pebbles.  The end of this string he fastened to his pickaxe, which figured no bad  anchor, and then, with the ball in his hand, unrolling it as he went,  set out in the dark through the natural gangs of the goblins'  territory.  The first night or two he came upon nothing worth  remembering; saw only a little of the home-life of the cobs in the  various caves they called houses; failed in coming upon anything to  cast light upon the foregoing design which kept the inundation for the  present in the background.  But at length, I think on the third or  fourth night, he found, partly guided by the noise of their implements,  a company of evidently the best sappers and miners amongst them, hard  at work.  What were they about?  It could not well be the inundation,  seeing that had in the meantime been postponed to something else.  Then  what was it?  He lurked and watched, every now and then in the greatest  risk of being detected, but without success.  He had again and again to  retreat in haste, a proceeding rendered the more difficult that he had  to gather up his string as he returned upon its course.  It was not  that he was afraid of the goblins, but that he was afraid of their  finding out that they were watched, which might have prevented the  discovery at which he aimed.  Sometimes his haste had to be such that,  when he reached home towards morning, his string, for lack of time to  wind it up as he 'dodged the cobs', would be in what seemed most  hopeless entanglement; but after a good sleep, though a short one, he  always found his mother had got it right again.  There it was, wound in  a most respectable ball, ready for use the moment he should want it!    'I can't think how you do it, mother,' he would say.    'I follow the thread,' she would answer--'just as you do in the mine.'  She never had more to say about it; but the less clever she was with  her words, the more clever she was with her hands; and the less his  mother said, the more Curdie believed she had to say.  But still he had  made no discovery as to what the goblin miners were about.        CHAPTER 13    The Cobs' Creatures    About this time the gentlemen whom the king had left behind him to  watch over the princess had each occasion to doubt the testimony of his  own eyes, for more than strange were the objects to which they would  bear witness.  They were of one sort--creatures--but so grotesque and  misshapen as to be more like a child's drawings upon his slate than  anything natural.  They saw them only at night, while "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7099"],[0,"A Trip to Manitoba (#11)"],[1,"rheumatism,\" and could not rise. But from long  confinement to her chair she had learnt to get about in it very well; her  natural energy expending itself on shuffling all over the room, screaming  to Alice to know \"why that there kettle didn't boil?\" and generally  making us welcome in her way.    \"There's lots of milk--plenty; you're welcome to it; and there'll be  boilin' water presently. If I could only get a holt of that Alice, I'd  make things lively for her! I'm wore out with her entirely. If you've  brought your own provisions all right; but there have been so many  travellers by lately, there isn't a bite in the house, till me eldest  darter comes and bakes for me to-morrow.\" Yes, she had seven darters, all  well married round about, blessed be God! and they came turn and turn  about to look after the old people, do the work, and see after things,  while she just kept the bit thing Alice to do the chores and wait on her;  but she warn't much good.    Thus our hostess ran on, until the horse was extricated, and we got  possession of our rugs and provisions. The boiling water appearing at the  same time, we soon sat down to tea; and, as it was too late to pitch our  tent that night, we spread our rugs and blankets on the two bedsteads \"up  ter chamber\"--a mere unfurnished garret--and were soon in bed.    Not long afterwards, hearing a great deal of laughter downstairs, I  listened, and gathered that \"Stick-in-the-Mud\" had arrived, and the men  were chaffing him for having paid the half-breed two dollars for lending  him two oxen for five minutes to extricate his train.    Tired as I was, the mosquitoes were so attentive that I found it  impossible to sleep. About midnight \"that wretched Alice\" crept up the  stairs, and lay down in a corner, partitioned off from the rest of the  garret by a grey blanket nailed to the rafters. I am sure she did not  undress much, nor could she have slept long, as she was downstairs again  before three o'clock, and I heard the old woman rating her from her bed.    When we descended at about six, the men and teams were all gone, and the  tenants of the floor bed had taken advantage of an offered ride to help  them on their way. Poor woman! she was journeying from Detroit, to the  work on \"15,\" to join her brother. She had been a month on the road, and  had still another week or ten days of walking before her.          CHAPTER VIII.    Faithless Jehu--The \"Blarney Stone\"--Mennonites in search of  News--\"Water, Water everywhere\"--A Herd of Buffaloes--A Mud  Village--Pointe du Chêne and Old Nile--At Dawson Route--A Cheerful  Party--_Toujours perdrix_--The \"Best Room\"--A Government Shanty--Cats  and Dogs--Birch River--Mushroom-picking--The Mosquito Plague--A Corduroy  Road--The Cariboo Muskeg.      When we resumed our journey, the weather was hazy and seemed to threaten  a thunderstorm. Accordingly, we made great haste, in the hope of reaching  \"Pointe du Chêne\" proper before the storm broke. But when all else was  ready, neither our Jehu nor his steeds could be found; he had taken them  about a mile further on, to spend the night at a friend's, and did not  make his appearance until eight o'clock. As I bade our old hostess  good-bye, she seized hold of my ulster, and feeling its texture, said--    \"Are ye warm enough, child, in that thing? Ye'll feel the cold drivin'.  Ye'd better have a shawl.\"    Thanking her for her inquiries, I assured her that I was quite warm.    \"Ah, well,\" she said, patting me on the arm, \"take care of yourself. Good  people are scarce.\"    Poor old creature! her good nature made me glad she was my countrywoman.  A kind thought expressed in the familiar accents of \"Ould Oireland\" is  welcome to the wayfarer in strange lands, even though it may often be  \"only blarney\" after all.    Reaching a bend in the little river Seine at noon, we halted for dinner,  and lighted a fire. But not daring to waste much time in unpacking, we  took what we could eat in our fingers, and fed the children. Before we  had finished, we were joined by a party of Mennonites, in a comfortable  covered waggon drawn by two powerful horses. The family consisted of an  elderly man; his wife, a pretty, quaint-looking little woman; a daughter,  apparently sixteen; a boy of twelve; and two little girls of about six,  looking like twins. They were well dressed, in the quaint costume of  their country. The man, who alone could speak English, told us they were  going to Winnipeg to hear the war news, and gave a look of utter  astonishment at our ignorance of the latest telegrams. It made me feel  quite ashamed of not having taken more interest in the progress of  current events, to meet a party of emigrants driving miles through these  solitudes to hear what I had passed heedlessly by when close under my  hand. The Mennonite elder was very polite; but, judging from the shrugs  indulged in by the family after a remark uttered in their own language,  they did not think highly of our intelligence.    Before we were packed into the waggon again the rain came down in  earnest, and the whole afternoon was spent in vain endeavours to keep  ourselves dry. Waterproofs, blankets, umbrellas, all were soaked, as hour  after hour we were dragged slowly through the muskeg, or marsh, following  no apparent track, and with the water often up to the \"hubs\" of the  wheels. No sooner were our umbrellas placed in a suitable position to  keep off the rain, than Jehu would make one of his _détours_, and  the wind and rain meeting us on the other side, away flew our wraps, and  all the umbrellas had to be rearranged. The difficulty of doing this, and  yet keeping them from dripping down some one's neck, was almost  insuperable. Mosquitoes, too, flying about in swarms, added their quota  to our discomfort. The poor canary had a hard time of it, for in spite of  all our care the cage repeatedly filled with water, which I had to empty  over the side of the waggon. Luckily, the cats kept quiet, and no one was  anxious to know whose feet were in the box of plants!    About three miles from Pointe du Chêne, a herd of buffalo feeding in the  distance made us forget our misery for a moment. They had not been met  with so near a civilized neighbourhood for years; the wet and stormy  weather was the cause of their approach. I was disappointed in their  appearance; they looked to me very like a herd of farm cattle, but seemed  to feed closer together. I had, however, not much chance to study their  peculiarities; another _détour_ speedily requiring my attention. On  looking for the buffaloes when again at leisure, they were nowhere to be  seen.    Pointe du Chêne is, without exception, the muddiest village I ever was  in. We drove through streams of mud; fences were built in mud, mud  extended on every side for acres. The houses were so surrounded with mud,  ankle-deep, nay, knee-deep, that one wondered how the inmates ever got  out. Yet they told us that in a few weeks all would be quite dry; that  what were now some of the largest mud-lakes would then be the finest  wheat-fields; and it is possible that mud here may have the same  fertilizing properties as it has on the banks of the Nile, and that  agriculture may be carried on upon the same principles in this part of  Canada as in Egypt.    At the Dawson route way-house we were received by a white-haired old man  _en route_ to take a situation as cook in one of the houses on the  line--though certainly no one ever looked less like a cook. He ushered us  into the kitchen, the only room boasting a fire, and we were there met by  the proprietor, a depressed and apologetic sort of person. After several  whispered consultations with a hopeless wife, who moved in melancholy  protest, or sat with her head leaning against the wall, applying the  corner of her apron to her eyes so constantly, that that particular  corner would not lie flat when allowed to drop, he put up a stove in the  front room, which was soon festooned in every direction with our drenched  garments.    Two rooms upstairs, clean-looking, but almost devoid of furniture, were  allotted to us, and finding that we should be unable to continue our  journey for at least thirty-six hours, we tried to make the best of them.  Fearing that we might encounter further delays where it would be  impossible to get food, we decided to husband what we had, especially as  we discovered that our Jehu, whenever he got into the waggon from the wet  muskeg, had sat on the bag of bread, which still further reduced our  supplies. Accordingly we determined to content ourselves with whatever  might be set before us, which proved to be pork, bread, and tea for  breakfast; bread, tea, and pork for dinner; and tea, pork, and bread for  supper. As we ventured to make a mild remark upon the monotony of the  bill of fare, a bottle of pickles was produced next morning, our dejected  hostess informing us, in a sepulchral tone, that it cost \"one dollar,  Hudson Bay Company store prices.\"    Towards nightfall the French teamster arrived, with his load rather  mixed. He had been compelled to unload and reload so often, that  everything was where it should not be. Stove-pipes, down which the rain  poured in rusty streams, were lying on the top of the best mattresses;  and, generally speaking, all the light things were underneath, and all  the heavy ones on the top. Soon after the Frenchman, \"Stick-in-the-Mud\"  arrived alone, drenched and miserable. _His_ load was again \"stuck  in the muskeg, a matter of two mile off, he guessed.\" If left there all  night, it would sink so deep in that quicksand-like marsh that there  would be little hope of ever extracting it. The poor lad said his team  was too done up to be of any use, and he was so \"dead tired, he hadn't a  leg to stand on.\" Still, he didn't object to go back if men and teams  were sent with him. And after a great deal of tramping through the muddy  village, our people succeeded in getting"]]]
