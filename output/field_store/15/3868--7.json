Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and      lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you,      not only in this record but also in the record which shall come      unto the Gentiles from the Jews, [4] which record shall come from      the Gentiles unto you. For behold, this [5] is written for the      intent that ye may believe that; [6] and if ye believe that ye will      believe this also; and if ye believe this, ye will know concerning      your fathers, and also the marvelous works which were wrought by      the power of God among them. And ye will also know that ye are a      remnant of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the      people of the first covenant.\" (Mormon 7:5-10.)    This passage is important because that in addition to assigning  substantially the same reasons for the writing and coming forth of the  Book of Mormon, as those before enumerated, it brings out the fact that  the Book of Mormon was written also to be a witness for the Bible,  to prove it true, for the language in the above passage makes plain  reference to the Bible, the \"record\" which comes from the Jews to the  Gentiles, and from the Gentiles to the remnant of the Lamanites to whom  Mormon makes reference.    This is also the testimony of the first Nephi. In vision he saw the  advent of the Gentile races upon the western hemisphere. He saw their  victories over the remnant of the seed of his brethren, the Lamanites.  He then proceeds:        And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles,      and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and      I beheld that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful,      like unto my people before they were slain. And it came to pass      that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of      captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of      the Lord was with them. And I beheld that their mother Gentiles      were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to      battle against them. And I beheld that the power of God was with      them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were      gathered together against them to battle. And I, Nephi, beheld that      the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the      power of God out of the hands of all other nations. And it came to      pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land; and I      beheld a book, and it was carried forth among them. And the angel      said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the book? And I said unto      him: I know not. And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth      of a Jew. And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book      that thou beholdest, is a record of the Jews, which contains the      covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel      and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets;      and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the      plates of brass, [7] save there are not so many; nevertheless,      they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto      the house of Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the      Gentiles.        And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that the      book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded      forth from the mouth of a Jew it contained the plainness of the      gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear record; and      they bear record according to the truth which is in the Lamb of      God. Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity unto      the Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God. And after      they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from      the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the foundation of a great      and abominable church, which is most abominable above all other      churches; for behold, they have taken away from the gospel of the      Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many      covenants of the Lord have they taken away. And all this have they      done that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord, that      they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the children      of men. Wherefore, thou seest that after the book had gone forth      through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there      are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which      is the book of the Lamb of God. And after these plain and precious      things were taken away it goeth forth unto all the nations of the      Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the nations of the      Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou hast seen      with the Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity, thou      seest--because of the many plain and precious things which have      been taken out of the book, which were plain unto the understanding      of the children of men, according to the plainness which is in the      Lamb of God--because of these things which are taken away out of      the gospel of the Lamb, an exceeding great many do stumble, yea,      insomuch that Satan hath great power over them. * * * And it came      to pass that the angel of the Lord spoke unto me, saying: Behold,      saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the remnant of the      house of Israel--and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of      thy father [8]mm after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten      them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble      exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the      gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable      church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb--I will be      merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring      forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall      be plain and precious saith the Lamb.        For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy seed,      [9] that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto      them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall      be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy      brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth unto      the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.        And in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, and my      rock and my salvation. * * * And it came to pass that I beheld the      remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb      of God, which had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that      it came forth from the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of      my brethren. And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other      books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles      unto them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of      the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon      all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and      of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true. And the angel spake      unto me, saying: These last records which thou hast seen among the      Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of      the twelve apostles of Lamb, and shall make known the plain and      precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall      make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of      God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world;      and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved. And      they must come according to the words which shall be established      by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made      known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of      the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both shall be      established in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd over all      the earth. [10]    The reference here made to \"the book of the Lamb of God, which had  proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew,\" is beyond all question the  Bible; while the \"other books,\" which came forth by the power of the  Lamb, from the Gentiles unto the remnant of Lehi's descendants, and  which records are to establish the truth of the first records, or the  Bible, is in plain allusion to the Book of Mormon and other scriptures  to be brought forth by the power of God in the last days.    From all this, then, it is very evident that the purposes for which  the Book of Mormon were written, counting in this summary both those  reasons already enumerated and those stated in the passages last  quoted, are:    First, to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great  things the Lord has done for their fathers.    Second, to teach them the covenants of the Lord made with their  fathers, that the remnants may know that they are not cast off forever.    Third, to convince both Jews and Gentiles that Jesus is the Christ, the  Eternal God, and that he manifests himself to all nations.    Fourth, to bring the knowledge of a Savior to the remnants of the house  of Israel on the western hemisphere, through the testimony of the  Nephites and Lamanites as well as through the testimony of the Jews,  that they might more fully believe the gospel.    Fifth, to bring to the Jews the testimony of the Nephites that Jesus  is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that they might have the  testimony of the Nephites as well as that of their fathers that Jesus  is their Messiah.    Sixth, to be a witness for the truth of the Bible, to establish its  authenticity, and its credibility by bringing other witnesses than  those of the Eastern world to testify to the same great truths that are  contained in the sacred pages of the Bible.    Seventh, to restore "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4732"],[0,"Prolegomena to the History of Israel (#11)"],[1," and heaven ordained by God at this gate.    All this is only to be understood as a glorification of the  relations and arrangements of the cultus as we find them (say) in  the first centuries of the divided kingdom.  All that seems  offensive and heathenish to a later age is here consecrated and  countenanced by Jehovah Himself and His favoured ones,-- the high  places, the memorial stones (maccceboth), the trees, the wells. /1/    ******************************  1. But it is only the public cultus and that of certain leading  sanctuaries that is thus glorified; on the other hand, the domestic  worship of seraphim, to which the women are specially attached,  is already discountenanced (in E) by Jacob.  Asherim are not  alluded to, molten images are rejected, particularly by E.  Here perhaps a correction of the ancient legend has already  taken place in JE.  ************************************    An essential agreement prevails between the Jehovistic law  which sanctions the existing seats of worship and the Jehovistic  narrative; the latter is as regards its nucleus perhaps somewhat older.  Both obviously belong to the pre-prophetic period; a later revision  of the narrative in the prophetic sense has not altered the essential  character of its fundamental elements.  It is inconceivable that  Amos or Hosea, or any like-minded person, could go with such  sympathising love and believing reverence into narratives which only  served to invest with a still brighter nimbus and higher respect  the existing religious worship, carried on by the people  on the high places of Isaac as their holiest occupation.    I.II.2. The Jehovistic Book of the Covenant lies indeed at the  foundation of Deuteronomy, but in one point they differ  materially, and that precisely the one which concerns us here.  As there, so here also, the legislation properly so called begins  (Deut. xii.) with an ordinance relating to the service of the  altar; but now we have Moses addressing the Israeites in the  following terms: \"When ye come into the land of Canaan, ye shall  utterly destroy all the places of worship which ye find there,  and ye shall not worship Jehovah your God after the manner in which  the heathen serve theirs.  Nay, but only unto the place which the  Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes for His  habitation shall ye seek, and thither shall ye bring your offerings  and gifts, and there shall ye eat before Him and rejoice.  Here at  this day we do every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes, but  when ye have found fixed abodes, and rest from your enemies round  about, then shall the place which Jehovah shall choose for His  habitation in one of your tribes be the one place to which ye shall  bring your offerings and gifts.  Take heed that ye offer not in  every place that ye see; ye may not eat your holy gifts in  every town, but only in the place which Jehovah shall choose.\"    The Law is never weary of again and again repeating its  injunction of local unity of worship.  In doing so, it is in  conscious opposition to \"the things that we do here this day,\" and  throughout has a polemical and reforming attitude towards existing  usage.  It is rightly therefore assigned by historical criticism  to the period of the attacks made on the Bamoth by the reforming  party at Jerusalem.  As the Book of the Covenant, and the whole  Jehovistic writing in genera], reflects the first pre-prophetic  period in the history of the cultus, so Deuteronomy is the legal  expression of the second period of struggle and transition.  The  historical order is all the more certain because the literary  dependence of Deuteronomy on the Jehovistic laws and narratives  can be demonstrated independently, and is an admitted fact.  From  this the step is easy to the belief that the work whose discovery  gave occasion to King Josiah to destroy the local sanctuaries was  this very Book of Deuteronomy, which originally must have had an  independent existence, and a shorter form than at present.  This  alone, at least, of all the books of the Pentateuch, gives so  imperious an expression to the restriction of the sacrificial  worship to the one chosen place; here only does the demand make  itself so felt in its aggressive novelty and dominate the whole  tendency of the law-maker.  The old material which he makes use  of is invariably shaped with a view to this, and on all hands he  follows the rule out to its logical consequences.  To make its  fulfilment possible, he changes former arrangements, permitting  what had been forbidden, and prohibiting what had been allowed;  in almost every case this motive lies at the foundation of all his  other innovations.  This is seen, for example, when he permits  slaying without sacrificing, and that too anywhere; when, in order  not to abolish the right of asylum (Exodus xxi.13, 14; 1Kings ii.  28) along with the altars, he appoints special cities of refuge for  the innocent who are pursued by the avenger of blood; when he  provides for the priests of the suppressed sanctuaries,  recommending the provincials to take them along with them on their  sacrificial pilgrimages, and giving them the right to officiate in  the temple at Jerusalem just like the hereditarily permanent  clergy there.  In other respects also the dominance of the same  point of view is seen: for example, it is chiefly from regard to  it that the old ordinances and customs relating to the religious  dues and the festivals are set forth in the form which they must  henceforth assume.  A law so living, which stands at every point  in immediate contact with reality, which is at war with  traditionary custom, and which proceeds with constant reference to  the demands of practical life, is no mere velleity, no mere cobweb  of an idle brain, but has as certainly arisen out of historical  occasions as it is designed to operate powerfully on the course of  the subsequent history.  A judgment pronounced in accordance with  the facts can therefore assign to it an historical place only  within that movement of reformation which was brought to a  victorious issue by King Josiah.    I.II.3. It is often supposed that the Priestly Code is somewhat  indifferent to the question of the one sanctuary, neither  permitting multiplicity of sacrificial centres nor laying stress  upon the unity, and that on account of this attitude it must be  assigned to an earlier date than Deuteronomy. /1/    **************************************  1. De Wette, in the fifth place of his Habilitationsschrift ueber  das Deuteronomium (Jena, 1805): \"De hoc unico cultus sacri loco...  priores libri nihil omnino habent.  De sacrificiis tantum unice  ante tabernaculum conventus offerendis lex quaedam extat.  Sed in legibus de diebus festis, de primitiis et decimis,  tam saepe repetitis, nihil omnino monitum est de loco unico,  ubi celebrari et offerri debeant \" (Opusc. Theol, p. 163-165).  ****************************************    Such an idea is, to say the least, in the highest degree superficial.  The assumption that worship is restricted to one single centre  runs everywhere throughout the entire document.  To appeal specially,  in proof of the restriction, to Leviticus xvii. or Josh xxii., is  to indicate a complete failure to apprehend the whole tenor  of Exodus xxv.-Leviticus ix.  Before so much as a single regulation  having reference to the matter of worship can be given (such is  the meaning of the large section referred to), the one rightful place  wherein to engage in it must be specified.  The tabernacle is  not narrative merely, but, like all the narratives in that book,  law as well; it expresses the legal unity of the worship as  an historical fact, which, from the very beginning, ever since  the exodus, has held good in Israel.  One God one sanctuary,  that is the idea.  With the ordinances of the tabernacle, which form  the sum of the divine revelation on Sinai, the theocracy was founded;  where the one is, there is the other.  The description of it, therefore,  stands at the head of the Priestly Code, just as that of the temple  stands at the head of the legislation in Ezekiel.  It is the basis  and indispensable foundation, without which all else would merely  float in the air:  first must the seat of the Divine Presence on  earth be given before the sacred community can come into life and  the cultus into force.  Is it supposes that the tabernacle  tolerates other sanctuaries besides itself?  Why then the  encampment of the twelve tribes around it, which has no military,  but a purely religious significance, and derives its whole meaning  from its sacred centre?  Whence this concentration of all Israel  into one great congregation [ QHL, (DH ], without its like anywhere  else in the Old Testament?  On the contrary, there is no other  place besides this at which God dwells and suffers Himself to be  seen; no place but this alone where man can draw near to Him and  seek His face with offerings and gifts. This view is the axiom  that underlies the whole ritual legislation of the middle part of  the Pentateuch.  It is indicated with special clearness by the  LPNY (HL MW(D (before the tabernacle), introduced at every turn  in the ordinances for sacrifice.    What then are we to infer from this as to the historical place of  the Priestly Code, if it be judged necessary to assign it such a  place at all?  By all the laws of logic it can no more belong to  the first period than Deuteronomy does.  But is it older or  younger than Deuteronomy?  In that book the unity of the cultus is  COMMANDED, in the Priestly Code it is PRESUPPOSED.  Everywhere it  is tacitly assumed as a fundamental postulate, but nowhere does it  find actual expression; /1/ it is nothing new, but quite a thing    *******************************************  1.
