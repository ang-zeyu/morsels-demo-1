It would       seem to result from these estimates--which are of course       hypothetical, and deal with a matter that is exceedingly       obscure--that the intellectual value of the bee and the ant       must be more or less equal.    {37}    And now to return to our swarming hive, where the bees have already  given the signal for departure, without waiting for these  reflections of ours to come to an end. At the moment this signal is  given, it is as though one sudden mad impulse had simultaneously  flung open wide every single gate in the city; and the black throng  issues, or rather pours forth in a double, or treble, or quadruple  jet, as the number of exits may be; in a tense, direct, vibrating,  uninterrupted stream that at once dissolves and melts into space,  where the myriad transparent, furious wings weave a tissue throbbing  with sound. And this for some moments will quiver right over the  hive, with prodigious rustle of gossamer silks that countless  electrified hands might be ceaselessly rending and stitching; it  floats undulating, it trembles and flutters like a veil of gladness  invisible fingers support in the sky, and wave to and fro, from the  flowers to the blue, expecting sublime advent or departure. And at  last one angle declines another is lifted; the radiant mantle unites  its four sunlit corners; and like the wonderful carpet the  fairy-tale speaks of, that flits across space to obey its master's  command, it steers its straight course, bending forward a little as  though to hide in its folds the sacred presence of the future,  towards the willow, the pear-tree, or lime whereon the queen has  alighted; and round her each rhythmical wave comes to rest, as  though on a nail of gold, and suspends its fabric of pearls and of  luminous wings.    And then there is silence once more; and, in an instant, this mighty  tumult, this awful curtain apparently laden with unspeakable menace  and anger, this bewildering golden hail that streamed upon every  object near--all these become merely a great, inoffensive, peaceful  cluster of bees, composed of thousands of little motionless groups,  that patiently wait, as they hang from the branch of a tree, for the  scouts to return who have gone in search of a place of shelter.    {38}    This is the first stage of what is known as the \"primary swarm\" at  whose head the old queen is always to be found. They will settle as  a rule on the shrub or the tree that is nearest the hive; for the  queen, besides being weighed down by her eggs, has dwelt in constant  darkness ever since her marriage-flight, or the swarm of the  previous year; and is naturally reluctant to venture far into space,  having indeed almost forgotten the use of her wings.    The bee-keeper waits till the mass be completely gathered together;  then, having covered his head with a large straw hat (for the most  inoffensive bee will conceive itself caught in a trap if entangled  in hair, and will infallibly use its sting), but, if he be  experienced, wearing neither mask nor veil; having taken the  precaution only of plunging his arms in cold water up to the elbow,  he proceeds to gather the swarm by vigorously shaking the bough from  which the bees depend over an inverted hive. Into this hive the  cluster will fall as heavily as an over-ripe fruit. Or, if the  branch be too stout, he can plunge a spoon into the mass; and  deposit where he will the living spoonfuls, as though he were  ladling out corn. He need have no fear of the bees that are buzzing  around him, settling on his face and hands. The air resounds with  their song of ecstasy, which is different far from their chant of  anger. He need have no fear that the swarm will divide, or grow  fierce, will scatter, or try to escape. This is a day, I repeat,  when a spirit of holiday would seem to animate these mysterious  workers, a spirit of confidence, that apparently nothing can  trouble. They have detached themselves from the wealth they had to  defend, and they no longer recognise their enemies. They become  inoffensive because of their happiness, though why they are happy we  know not, except it be because they are obeying their law. A moment  of such blind happiness is accorded by nature at times to every  living thing, when she seeks to accomplish her end. Nor need we feel  any surprise that here the bees are her dupes; we ourselves, who  have studied her movements these centuries past, and with a brain  more perfect than that of the bee, we too are her dupes, and know  not even yet whether she be benevolent or indifferent, or only  basely cruel.    There where the queen has alighted the swarm will remain; and had  she descended alone into the hive, the bees would have followed, in  long black files, as soon as intelligence had reached them of the  maternal retreat. The majority will hasten to her, with utmost  eagerness; but large numbers will pause for an instant on the  threshold of the unknown abode, and there will describe the circles  of solemn rejoicing with which it is their habit to celebrate happy  events. \"They are beating to arms,\" say the French peasants. And  then the strange home will at once be accepted, and its remotest  corners explored; its position in the apiary, its form, its colour,  are grasped and retained in these thousands of prudent and faithful  little memories. Careful note is taken of the neighbouring  landmarks, the new city is founded, and its place established in the  mind and the heart of all its inhabitants; the walls resound with  the love-hymn of the royal presence, and work begins.    {39}    But if the swarm be not gathered by man, its history will not end  here. It will remain suspended on the branch until the return of the  workers, who, acting as scouts, winged quartermasters, as it were,  have at the very first moment of swarming sallied forth in all  directions in search of a lodging. They return one by one, and  render account of their mission; and as it is manifestly impossible  for us to fathom the thought of the bees, we can only interpret in  human fashion the spectacle that they present. We may regard it as  probable, therefore, that most careful attention is given to the  reports of the various scouts. One of them it may be, dwells on the  advantage of some hollow tree it has seen; another is in favour of a  crevice in a ruinous wall, of a cavity in a grotto, or an abandoned  burrow. The assembly often will pause and deliberate until the  following morning. Then at last the choice is made, and approved by  all. At a given moment the entire mass stirs, disunites, sets in  motion, and then, in one sustained and impetuous flight, that this  time knows no obstacle, it will steer its straight course, over  hedges and cornfields, over haystack and lake, over river and  village, to its determined and always distant goal. It is rarely  indeed that this second stage can be followed by man. The swarm  returns to nature; and we lose the track of its destiny.          III -- THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY    {40}    LET us rather consider the proceedings of the swarm the apiarist  shall have gathered into his hive. And first of all let us not be  forgetful of the sacrifice these fifty thousand virgins have made,  who, as Ronsard sings,--        \"In a little body bear so true a heart,--\"    and let us, yet once again, admire the courage with which they begin  life anew in the desert whereon they have fallen. They have  forgotten the splendour and wealth of their native city, where  existence had been so admirably organised and certain, where the  essence of every flower reminiscent of sunshine had enabled them to  smile at the menace of winter. There, asleep in the depths of their  cradles, they have left thousands and thousands of daughters, whom  they never again will see. They have abandoned, not only the  enormous treasure of pollen and propolis they had gathered together,  but also more than 120 pounds of honey; a quantity representing more  than twelve times the entire weight of the population, and close on  600,000 times that of the individual bee. To man this would mean  42,000 tons of provisions, a vast fleet of mighty ships laden with  nourishment more precious than any known to us; for to the bee honey  is a kind of liquid life, a species of chyle that is at once  assimilated, with almost no waste whatever.    Here, in the new abode, there is nothing; not a drop of honey, not a  morsel of wax; neither guiding-mark nor point of support. There is  only the dreary emptiness of an enormous monument that has nothing  but sides and roof. Within the smooth and rounded walls there only  is darkness; and the enormous arch above rears itself over  nothingness. But useless regrets are unknown to the bee; or in any  event it does not allow them to hinder its action. Far from being  cast down by an ordeal before which every other courage would  succumb, it displays greater ardour than ever. Scarcely has the hive  been set in its place, or the disorder allayed that ensued on the  bees' tumultuous fall, when we behold the clearest, most unexpected  division in that entangled mass. The greater portion, forming in  solid columns, like an army obeying a definite order, will proceed  to climb the vertical walls of the hive. The cupola reached, the  first to arrive will cling with the claws of their anterior legs,  those that follow hang on to the first, and so in succession, until  long chains have been formed that serve as a bridge to the crowd  that rises and rises. And, by slow degrees, these chains, as their  number increases, supporting each other and incessantly  interweaving, become garlands which, in their turn, the  uninterrupted and constant ascension transforms into a thick,  triangular curtain, or rather a kind"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45149"],[0,"The House of the Lord: A Study of Holy Sanctuaries Ancient and Modern (#11)"],[1,"59} Like the earlier  Temples, this comprised Porch, Holy Place, and Most Holy Place or  Holy of Holies. The Porch measured one hundred cubits both in width  and height. The Holy Place was forty by twenty cubits, as in the  Temple of Zerubbabel, but its height was increased to forty cubits.  By adding side chambers, with a passage between them and the main  building, Herod made the new Temple greater and grander than either  of its predecessors. The Holy of Holies retained the original form  and dimensions, making it a cube, twenty cubits in each measurement.  Between this and the Holy Place hung a double veil, of finest material,  elaborately embroidered. The outer of the two veils was open at the  north end, the inner at the south; so that the high priest who entered  at the appointed time once a year could pass between the veils without  exposing the Holy of Holies. The sacred chamber was empty save for a  large stone upon which the high priest sprinkled the sacrificial blood  on the Day of Atonement; this stone occupied the place of the Ark and  its Mercy Seat. Outside the veil, in the Holy Place, stood the altar of  incense, the seven-branched candle-stick, and the table of shewbread.    That the Temple of Herod was by far the grandest structure ever erected  as a Temple in any age is generally admitted; yet its beauty and  grandeur lay in architectural excellence rather than in the sanctity of  its worship or in the manifestation of the Divine Presence within its  walls. Its ritual and service were largely man-prescribed; for while  the letter of the Mosaic Law was professedly observed, the law had  been supplemented and in many features supplanted by rule and priestly  prescription. The Jews professed to consider it holy, and by them it  was {60} proclaimed as the House of the Lord. Devoid though it was  of the Divine accompaniments of earlier shrines accepted of God, and  defiled as it was by priestly arrogance and usurpation, as also by the  selfish interest of traffic and trade, it was nevertheless recognized  even by our Lord the Christ as His Father's House.[93] Therein the  Boy Jesus was presented as required by the Law,[94] thereto came He  with His people at the time of the Passover;[95] within its precincts  He declared Himself and the Father who sent Him.[96] When at last,  rejected by His own, and by them brought to the cross, He wrought the  sacrifice through which salvation was made possible to man, the veil of  the Temple was rent by an unseen power and the last vestige of supreme  sanctity departed from the place.[97]    As long as it stood, however, the Temple was held by the Jews in high  veneration. An utterance of the Savior, construed by the dark-minded as  an aspersion upon the Temple, was used against Him as one of the chief  accusations on which His death was demanded. When the Jews clamored  for a sign of His authority He predicted His own death and subsequent  resurrection, saying, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will  raise it up.\"[98] They blindly regarded this remark as a disrespectful  allusion to their Temple, a structure built by human hands, and they  refused to forget or forgive. That this veneration continued after the  crucifixion of our Lord is evident from accusations brought against  Stephen, and still later against Paul. In their murderous rage the  people accused {61} Stephen of disrespect for the Temple, and brought  false witnesses who uttered perjured testimony saying, \"This man  ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place.\"[99]  And Stephen was numbered with the martyrs. When it was claimed that  Paul had brought with him into the temple precincts, a Gentile, the  whole city was aroused, and the infuriated mob dragged Paul from the  place and sought to kill him.[100]    For thirty or more years after the death of Christ, the Jews continued  the work of adding to and embellishing the temple buildings. The  elaborate design conceived and projected by Herod had been practically  completed; the Temple was well-nigh finished, and, as soon afterward  appeared, was ready for destruction. Its fate had been definitely  foretold by the Savior Himself. Commenting on a remark by one of the  disciples concerning the great stones and the splendid buildings on  the Temple hill, Jesus had said, \"Seest thou these great buildings?  There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown  down.\"[101]    This dire prediction soon found its literal fulfilment. In the great  conflict with the Roman legions under Titus, many of the Jews had taken  refuge within the temple courts, seemingly hoping that there the Lord  would again fight the battles of His people and give them victory. But  the protecting presence of Jehovah had long since departed therefrom  and Israel was left a prey to the foe. Though Titus would have spared  the Temple, his legionaries, maddened by the lust of conflict, started  the conflagration {62} and everything that could be burned was burned.  The slaughter of the Jews was appalling; thousands of men, women and  children were ruthlessly butchered within the walls, and the temple  courts were literally flooded with human blood. This event occurred  in the year 70 A. D.; and according to Josephus, in the same month  and on the same day of the month as that on which the once glorious  Temple of Solomon had fallen a prey to the flames kindled by the king  of Babylon.[102] Of the temple furniture the golden candlestick and the  table of shewbread from the Holy Place were carried by Titus to Rome as  trophies of war; and representations of these sacred pieces are to be  seen on the arch erected to the name of the victorious general.    Since the destruction of the splendid Temple of Herod no other  structure of the kind, no Temple, no House of the Lord as the terms are  used distinctively, has been reared on the eastern hemisphere. Sometime  between 361 and 363 A. D. the Roman emperor Julian, surnamed because  of his reversion from Christianity to paganism Julian the Apostate,  attempted to reconstruct the Temple at Jerusalem. His purpose was  not that of devotion to nor love for God; but that of controverting  prophecy, and thus proving false the Christian belief.[103] So ends the  category of Temples reared to the name of the living God prior to the  dispensation of the fulness of times.
