The elders laid  their hands upon her and she was healed by the power of God.    It was not a time for delay. These brothers had long waited for the  message which had now brought the glorious tidings of a divine call.  They would not delay obedience to those ordinances {35} which opened  the door to the enjoyment of greater light. They asked for baptism at  the hands of the elders. On December 31st, the last day of the year,  1833, there assembled at the water's edge about 11 o'clock in the  morning a large number of people who witnessed the baptism of Wilford  Woodruff by Zera Pulsipher. There were baptized at the same time his  brother Azmon, also two young ladies who had been healed the day  before. Of this circumstance he writes in his journal: \"The snow was  about three feet deep, the day was cold, and the water was mixed with  ice and snow, yet I did not feel the cold.\"    There was a public meeting held that night by candle-light and a large  congregation assembled; but unlike the meeting that was first held,  there was a spirit of opposition. After explaining to the people the  ordinance of the laying on of hands, the elders confirmed Wilford and  his companions members of the Church by the laying on of hands for the  gift of the Holy Ghost. Speaking of this meeting he says: \"There was a  good deal of darkness in the room; but when the congregation dispersed,  the people took away with them that darkness. The Holy Ghost fell  upon us and we had a time of great rejoicing. The next day, January  1st, 1834, my brother Azmon reproached Noah Holton for his tardiness  in receiving the gospel after he had made a covenant to obey it on  condition that his daughter be healed. Holton received the warning and  was baptized.\"    The story of Wilford Woodruff's conversion was simply a continuation of  the life carefully prepared to receive the new message, and to embrace  in all sincerity the truth which it contained. What a similarity of  experience is found in the lives of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Heber  C. Kimball, John Taylor, and indeed thousands of Latter-day Saints! It  was the same spirit of inquiry, the same profound and heartfelt desire  to know the whole truth of God's existence and His divine purpose  respecting the children of men. The truth is, the new spirit of a  coming dispensation was upon them. Their hearts were strongly inclined  to worship. They were eager to know how they should worship; for they  saw in the religious contentions of those days a spirit strange to the  teachings of the Bible. They were in very truth, \"Sheep who knew the  shepherd's voice and a stranger they would not follow.\"    {36} There is something beautiful in the ambitions of Wilford Woodruff  throughout a long life of great service. He was ambitious to know the  will of God and to be worthy of Divine approbation. If he could only  be an active worker in the Church of Christ; if the Lord would only  receive him into Divine service, his ambitions would be realized.    On January 25th, 1834, Elder Pulsipher organized the Saints in Richland  into a branch of the Church. He ordained Wilford Woodruff to the  office of a teacher and gave him a written license which embodied the  certificate of his baptism and his ordination. \"I felt,\" he writes,  \"that I could truly exclaim with the prophet of God, 'I had rather be  a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of  wickedness.' The fulness of the everlasting gospel had come at last. It  filled my heart with great joy. It laid the foundation of a greater and  more glorious work than I ever expected to see in this life. I pray God  in the name of Jesus Christ to guide my future life, that I may live to  His honor and glory, and be a blessing to my fellowmen, and in the end  be saved in His celestial kingdom, even so, Amen.\"    {37}        CHAPTER 6.    ZION'S CAMP, 1834.    His First Call.--Leaves for Kirtland.--His Neighbors' Warning.--First  Meeting with Prophet.--A Remarkable Prophetic Gift.--Zion's  Camp.--Zelph.--Escape Mob at Fishing River.--Epidemic of Cholera.--His  Residence in Missouri.--Consecrations.    Perhaps no man in the Church ever felt more profoundly the truth of  the words, \"God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform,\"  than Wilford Woodruff. He was so intensely spiritual, so completely  devoted to the service of God, that all through his life the miraculous  manifestations of God's purposes were abundantly given. He had never  based his faith upon miracles, they merely confirmed what he believed  with all his heart and supported his ideas of the teachings of Holy  Writ.    Confirming the divine power which attended his baptism, the words of  the Prophet Joseph contained in George Q. Cannon's history are here  given: \"In view of all that has since occurred, it is a remarkable  fact that the Prophet recorded in his journal of the 31st of December,  1833, the fact that 'Wilford Woodruff was baptized at Richland, Oswego  County, New York, by Zera Pulsipher,' and this was before the Prophet  and the future apostle and president had ever met in the flesh. This  is not the only mention of Wilford Woodruff in Joseph's diary prior  to their meeting. In one place the Prophet notices that Wilford had  been ordained a teacher. It was the 25th day of April, 1834, when  Wilford Woodruff visited the Prophet at Kirtland, and from that time  on until Joseph's death they were intimately associated. It was clear  that Joseph felt the staunch worthiness of his young brother, and in  relying upon him, the Prophet was leaning upon no weak or broken reed;  for Wilford Woodruff had then and has ever since shown the fidelity  of a Saint, and the integrity and prophetic power of an apostle of  Jesus Christ. He was one of the most faithful of all the men who were  gathered near to the Prophet's person, to share his trials and his  confidences. Wilford Woodruff never made any attempt to cultivate  showy qualities, and yet he was always marked among his fellows; his  characteristic humility and unswerving honesty being sufficient to  attract {38} the attention of all who have known him. His is another of  the names to be recorded with that of Joseph, and it is worthy to stand  side by side with the names of Brigham Young and John Taylor, for he  was as loyal to them as he and they were to Joseph, the first prophet  of this dispensation.\"    From the outset, the subject of this biography became a most ardent  worker in the cause he had espoused. He was ordained a teacher and  found immediate opportunity to give expression to his intense desire  to declare his belief in the purposes of his Maker. He and the Brother  Holton herein mentioned, shortly after their baptism, walked sixty-five  miles to Fabius to hold a meeting.    Events of far-reaching importance were rapidly closing in upon him.  On the 1st of April, Elders Parley P. Pratt and Harry Brown arrived  at Richland. They were there on an important mission. They were in  search of young and able-bodied men in the eastern branches of the  Church--young men whose services were needed in Zion's Camp, and  organization which at that time was being effected for the purpose of  assisting in the redemption of Zion, and of carrying supplies to the  suffering Saints who had been expelled by mob violence from their homes  in Jackson County, Missouri.    This was the first time Wilford Woodruff had met Parley P. Pratt, to  whose instructions he listened with great interest and attention, and  says he was greatly edified by what he had to say. Elder Pratt informed  him that it was his duty to prepare himself to go up to the land of  Zion. He accordingly settled up his business affairs, and bade good-bye  to his brother and kinsfolk in Richland.    On April 11th Wilford took Harry Brown and Warren Ingles in his wagon  and started with them for Kirtland, Ohio. On the way he met for the  first time Elders Orson Pratt and John Murdock. They all arrived in  Kirtland April 25th, 1834. Before he left Richland, many of his friends  and neighbors warned him not to go, and declared that if he did go, he  would be killed. He replied that the Lord had commanded him, and that  he would go; that he had no fears of any evil consequences as long as  he obeyed the Lord.    He gives an account of his first meeting with the Prophet {39} as  follows: \"Here for the first time in my life I met and had an interview  with our beloved Prophet Joseph Smith, the man whom God had chosen to  bring forth His revelations in these last days. My first introduction  was not of a kind to satisfy the preconceived notions of the sectarian  mind as to what a prophet ought to be, and how he should appear. It  might have shocked the faith of some men. I found him and his brother  Hyrum out shooting at a mark with a brace of pistols. When they stopped  shooting, I was introduced to Brother Joseph, and he shook hands with  me most heartily. He invited me to make his habitation my home while I  tarried in Kirtland. This invitation I most eagerly accepted, and was  greatly edified and blest during my stay with him. He asked me to help  him tan a wolfskin which he said he wished to use upon the seat of his  wagon on the way to Missouri. I pulled off my coat, stretched the skin  across the back of a chair, and soon had it tanned--although I had to  smile at my first experience with the Prophet.    \"That night we had a most enjoyable and profitable time in his home. In  conversation, he smote his hand upon his breast and said, 'I would to  God I could unbosom my feelings in the house of my friends.' He said  in relation to Zion's Camp, 'Brethren, don't be discouraged about our  not having means. The Lord will provide, and He will put it into the  heart of somebody to send me some money.' The very next day he received  a letter from Sister Vose, containing one hundred and fifty dollars.  When he opened"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#11)"],[1,"and fifty thousand acres. [34] One hundred and  fifty houses had been erected in Far West; there were four dry goods  stores, three family groceries, half a dozen blacksmith's shops, and  two hotels. [35] The excavation for a temple 120 by 80 feet had been  made, and a large commodious schoolhouse had been erected on the public  square. [36] The town of Adam-Ondi-Ahman was also making rapid progress.    {XLIV} By this time the Prophet Joseph and other leading men of the  Church had left Kirtland and located with the Saints in Missouri,  and everything looked propitious for the permanent establishment of  the Saints in the borders of Zion. The Saints had now been driven  bodily from Jackson county; and their homes, store houses and printing  establishment had been destroyed. The courts of Missouri had proven  powerless to restore to them their homes, their lands and other  property. The executive of the state confessed himself powerless to  return them to their possessions in Jackson county, and maintain  them there against the wishes of the people of that county. Indeed,  Governor Dunklin had weakly given up the vindication of the outraged  laws of the state, as we have seen, saying that whether the charges  of their enemies or the denials by the Saints were true he could not  tell; their neighbors seemed to believe them true, and whether true or  false the consequences would be the same, unless the Saints by their  conduct and argument could convince the Missourians of their innocence.  \"If you cannot do this,\" said the governor, \"all I can say to you is  that in this Republic the _vox populi is the vox Dei_!\" The Saints  at some considerable sacrifice had withdrawn from Clay county at the  request of her citizens, in the interests of peace, and had settled  in the new counties of Caldwell and Daviess, where settlers were few  and the country less desirable than in Jackson and Clay counties. In  doing these things they had repeatedly sacrificed their rights as  citizens, both of Missouri and of the United States. Smitten on the one  cheek--speaking figuratively--they had turned the other; sued at the  law for their coat, they had given their cloak also; compelled to go  one mile with their enemy, they had gone with him twain. After doing  all this for the sake of peace and the friendship of the Missourians,  when the Saints saw forming again those elements which threatened their  peace; when old enemies appeared upon the new scene of the Saints'  activities, and openly threatened their peace and boasted that they  would again prosper by despoiling them of their new possessions; when  they saw the red right hand of a relentless persecution arming again to  plague them, it is small wonder if righteous anger flushed their cheek,  made bright their eyes with indignation and led them instinctively to  form the resolution that they would submit no more to such acts of  despoliation, injustice and outrage.    It was this sense of outraged justice and humanity which led to the  deliverance of a very noted \"Oration\" by Sidney Rigdon at Far West, on  the Fourth of July, 1838, in the course of which there was expressed  a strong determination to no more submit quietly to mob violence, and  acts of pillage. At this distance of time from that occasion, and  balancing against the heated utterances of the speaker the subsequent  uses made of them to incite the public mind to that series of acts  which {XLV} culminated in the expulsion of the Saints from the state,  we say those utterances were untimely, extreme, and unwise. So indeed  they were. The speaker seems to have thrown discretion to the winds,  and in the fervor of his rhetoric made threats of retaliation on behalf  of the Saints, if assailed, that went beyond all bounds of reason and  humanity, and proved a very damaging as also a very potent factor  against the Saints in the subsequent movements of their enemies against  them.    But while this oratorical outburst against injustice was unwise, it  was a very natural thing. The marvel is not that it came at the time  it did, but that it did not come earlier, more vehemently, and that  some of the things it threatened were not effectively carried out.  What the Prophet thought, and how he felt respecting the repeated acts  of injustice heaped upon himself and the Saints in Missouri; how he  felt and what he proposed for the future is made clear in his journal  entry for September 1st, 1838; and, fortunately, is more temperately  expressed than in the oration of July the fourth. He said:    \"There is great excitement at present among the Missourians, who are  seeking if possible an occasion against us. They are continually  chafing us, and provoking us to anger if possible, one sign of  threatening after another, but we do not fear them, for the Lord God,  the Eternal Father is our God, and Jesus the Mediator is our Savior,  and in the great I Am is our strength and confidence.    \"We have been driven time after time, and that without cause; and  smitten again and again, and that without provocation; until we have  proved the world with kindness, and the world has proved us, that we  have no designs against any man or set of men, that we injure no man,  that we are peaceable with all men, minding our own business, and our  business only. We have suffered our rights and our liberties to be  taken from us; we have not avenged ourselves of those wrongs; we have  appealed to magistrates, to sheriffs, to judges, to government and to  the President of the United States, all in vain; yet we have yielded  peaceably to all these things. We have not complained at the great God,  we murmured not, but peaceably left all, and retired into the back  country, in the broad and wild prairies, in the barren and desolate  plains, and there commenced anew; we made the desolate places to bud  and blossom as the rose; and now the fiend-like race is disposed to  give us no rest. Their father the devil, is hourly calling upon them  to be up and doing, and they, like willing and obedient children, need  not the second admonition; but in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son  of the living God, we will endure it no longer, if the great God will  arm us with courage, with strength and with power, to resist them in  their persecutions. We will not act on the offensive, but always on the  defensive; our rights and our liberties shall not be taken from us, and  we {XLVI} peaceably submit to it as we have done heretofore, but we  will avenge ourselves of our enemies, inasmuch as they will not let us  alone.\"    No one can marvel at the conclusion here arrived at if he will but pay  attention to and give due weight to the enumerated wrongs which precede  it. It would be asking the Saints to be more than human if we say they  ought not to have indulged, much less to have expressed, such feelings  of resentment.    Meantime, however, we may not close our eyes to the fact that there  was unwisdom manifested on the part of a few of the Saints, which gave  advantage to their enemies, by affording pretexts for some of their  accusations. That unwisdom, as we have seen, consisted of boasting  as to what the Lord would do in the immediate future in giving them  possession of western Missouri as an inheritance; perhaps some unwise  allusions to the supposed part the Lamanites would take in the  establishment and redemption of Zion; and the vehement threats of  retaliation in the event of their being further assailed. These unwise  utterances, however, were made, for the most part, by the overzealous  and ignorant. Men who had no grasp of the real genius of the great  work whose foundations were then being laid; men who, in common with  men of like nature in all ages and in all great movements, have been  trouble-breeders; who, in their contemplation of ultimate results  to be achieved, overleaped the intervening space through which the  movement must pass, the difficulties it must encounter and overcome,  the experiences its adherents must gain, the great and varied labors  they must perform. They seem not to understand that great movements  require time for the achievement of their ends; that time with God is  one thing, with man quite another thing; that the thing which is \"nigh  at hand\" with the Lord may be to men afar off; and overlooking these  important facts leads such men into many errors of thought and action.  It was wholly reprehensible, unwarranted, and cowardly, however, on the  part of the Missourians to take advantage of the unwise utterances of  such characters and charge their sentiments and folly to the whole body  religious, that never entertained such sentiments nor contemplated the  actions such sentiments suggest. And this is to be said even of those  who were unwise enough to give the advantage here noted to the enemies  of the Saints, they at no time or place were ever guilty of attempting  in any manner to carry into effect by any action of their own the  unwise and unwarranted opinions they entertained and expressed. Their  boastings and vain speculations were in relation to what the Lord was  going to do, not what they themselves purposed doing. These utterances  were merely the effervescence of overwrought minds, of overzealous,  foolish, but well meaning and harmless people. Unhappily, however,  what they said gave the enemy an advantage that he was not slow to  avail {XLVII} himself of, and the unwisdom of some of the Saints is a  factor that must be reckoned with in dealing with the causes of the  persecutions of the Saints in Missouri.    _The Real Cause of the Missouri Persecutions_.    Having considered those facts and circumstances which may be regarded  as the minor causes and pretexts of the Missouri persecutions, let  us now come to the heart of the matter, to the real cause of the  persecution of the Saints.    It was against the Saints as a religious sect that the Missourians  first complained. It was \"in"]]]
