Mother said so. She used to sing to me until she was very  sick. Then she said she wasn't going to sing any more on earth, but up  in heaven.\"    \"Well--and what then?\"    \"And then she died, sir,\" said the child; tears brimming down the dark  cheek now ominously flushed scarlet.    John Harvey was silent for a few moments.    Presently he said: \"Well, if she died, my little girl, you may live, you  know.\"    \"Oh, no, sir! no, sir! I'd rather go there; and be with mother. Sometimes  I have a dreadful pain in my side and cough as she did. There won't be  any pain up there, sir; it's a beautiful world!\"    \"How do you know?\" faltered on the lips of the skeptic.    \"My mother told me so, sir.\"    Words how impressive! manner how child-like, and yet so wise!    John Harvey had had a praying mother. His chest labored for a moment--  the sobs that struggled for utterance could be heard even in their  depths--and still those large, soft, lustrous eyes, like magnets impelled  his glance toward them.    \"Child you must have a pair of shoes.\" John Harvey's voice was husky.    Hands were thrust in pockets, purses pulled out, and the astonished child  held in her little palm more money than she had ever seen before.    \"Her father is a poor, consumptive organ-grinder,\" whispered one. \"I  suppose he's too sick to be out tonight.\"    Along the soggy street went the child, under the protection of John  Harvey, but not with shoes that drank the water at every step. Warmth  and comfort were hers now. Down in the deep den-like lanes of the city  walked the man, a little cold hand in his. At an open door they stopped;  up broken, creaking stairs they climbed. Another doorway was opened, and  a wheezing voice called out of the dim arch, \"Carletta!\"    \"O Father! Father! see what I have brought you! Look at me! Look at me\"  and down went the silver, and venting her joy, the poor child fell;  crying and laughing together, into the old man's arms.    Was he a man?    A face dark and hollow, all overgrown with hair black as night and  uncombed--a pair of wild eyes--a body bent nearly double--hands like claws.    \"Did he give you all this, my child?\"    \"They all did, Father; now you shall have soup and oranges.\"    \"Thank you, sir--I'm sick, you see--all gone, sir!--had to send the poor  child out, or we'd starve. God bless you, sir! I wish I was well enough  to play you a tune,\" and he looked wistfully towards the corner where  stood the old organ, baize-covered, the baize in tatters.    One month after that the two men met again as if by agreement, and walked  slowly down town. Treading innumerable passages they came to the gloomy  building where lived Carletta's father.    No--not _lived there_, for as they paused a moment out came two or  three men bearing a pine coffin. In the coffin slept the old organ-grinder.    \"It was very sudden, sir,\" said a woman, who recognized his benefactor.  \"Yesterday the little girl was took sick and it seemed as if he drooped  right away. He died at six last night.\"    The two men went silently up stairs. The room was empty of everything  save a bed, a chair and a nurse provided by John Harvey. The child lay  there, not white, but pale as marble, with a strange polish on her brow.      \"Well my little one, are you better?\"    \"Oh no, sir; Father is gone up there and I am going.\"    Up _there_! John Harvey turned unconsciously towards his friend.    \"Did you ever hear of Jesus?\" asked John Harvey's friend.    \"Oh yes.\"    \"Do you know who he was?\"    \"_Good Jesus_,\" murmured the child.    \"Hawkins, this breaks me down,\" said John Harvey and he placed his  handkerchief to his eyes.    \"Don't cry, don't cry; I can't cry, I'm so glad,\" said the child  exultingly.    \"What are you glad for, my dear?\" asked John Harvey's friend.    \"To get away from here,\" she said deliberately. \"I used to be so cold  in the winter, for we didn't have fire sometimes; but mother used to hug  me close and sing about heaven. Mother told me to never mind and kissed  me and said if I was His, the Savior would love me and one of these days  would give me a better home, and so I gave myself to Him, for I wanted  a better home. And, oh, I shall sing there and be so happy!\"    With a little sigh she closed her eyes.    \"Harvey, are faith and hope nothing?\" asked Mr. Hawkins.    \"Don't speak to me, Hawkins; to be as that little child I would give all  I have.\"    \"And to be like her you need give nothing--only your stubborn will, your  skeptical doubts, and the heart that will never know rest till at the  feet of Christ.\"    There was no answer. Presently the hands moved, the arms were raised,  the eyes opened--yet, glazed though they were they turned still upward.      [Illustration]    \"See!\" she cried; \"Oh, there is mother! and angels! and they are all  singing.\" Her voice faltered, but the celestial brightness lingered yet  on her face.    \"There is no doubting the soul-triumph there,\" whispered Mr. Hawkins.    \"It is wonderful,\" replied John Harvey, looking on both with awe and  tenderness. \"Is she gone?\"    He sprang from his chair as if he would detain her; but the chest and  forehead were marble now, the eyes had lost the fire of life; she must  have died as she lay looking at them.    \"She was always a sweet little thing,\" said the nurse softly.    John Harvey stood as if spell-bound. There was a touch on his arm; he  started.    \"John,\" said his friend, with an affectionate look, \"shall we pray?\"    [Illustration]    For a minute there was no answer--then came tears; the whole frame of  the subdued skeptic shook as he said--it was almost a cry: \"Yes, pray,  pray!\"    And from the side of the dead child went up agonizing pleadings to the  throne of God. And that prayer was answered--the miracle was wrought--  the lion became a lamb--the doubter a believer--the skeptic a Christian!      --A Tract.        HOW THREE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN MET THEIR FATE    [Illustration: \"The children saw their fate. They then knelt down and  commenced to pray.\"]    When the Lawrence Mills were on fire a number of years ago--I don't mean  on fire, but when the mill fell in--the great mill fell in, and after  it had fallen in, the ruins caught fire, there was only one room left  entire, and in it were three Mission Sunday School children imprisoned.  The neighbors and all hands got their shovels and picks and crowbars and  were working to set the children free. It came on night and they had not  yet reached the children. When they were near them, by some mischance  the lantern broke, and the ruins caught fire. They tried to put it out,  but could not succeed. They could talk with the children, and even pass  to them some refreshments, and encourage them to keep up. But, alas, the  flames drew nearer and nearer to the prison. Superhuman were the efforts  made to rescue the children; the men bravely fought back the flames; but  the fire gained fresh strength, and returned to claim its victims. Then  piercing shrieks arose when the spectators saw that the efforts of the  firemen were hopeless. The children saw their fate. They then knelt down  and commenced to sing the little hymn we have all been taught in our  Sunday School days. Oh! how sweet: \"Let others seek a home below, which  flames devour and waves overflow.\" The flames had now reached them; the  stifling smoke began to pour into their little room, and they began to  sink, one by one, upon the floor. A few moments more and the fire circled  around them, and their souls were taken into the bosom of Christ. Yes,  let others seek a home below if they will, but seek ye the Kingdom of  God with all your hearts.    --Moody's Anecdotes        HE BLESSES GOD FOR THE FAITH OF HIS LITTLE GIRL    \"I came home one night very late,\" says Brother Matthew Hale Smith (in  his \"Marvels of Prayer\"), \"and had gone to bed to seek needed rest. The  friend with whom I boarded awoke me out of my first refreshing sleep,  and informed me that a little girl wanted to see me. I turned over in  bed and said:    \"'I am very tired, tell her to come in the morning and I will see her.'      \"My friend soon returned and said:    \"'I think you had better get up. The girl is a poor little suffering  thing. She is thinly clad, is without bonnet or shoes. She has seated  herself on the doorstep and says she must see you and will wait till you  get up.'    \"I dressed myself and opening the outside door I saw one of the most  forlorn-looking little girls I ever beheld. Want, sorrow, suffering,  neglect, seemed to struggle for the mastery. She looked up to my face  and said:    \"'Are you the man that preached last night and said that Christ could  save to the uttermost?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Well, I was there, and I want you to come right down to my house and  try to save my poor father.'    \"'What's the matter with your father?'    \"'He's a very good father when he don't drink. He's out of work and he  drinks awfully. He's almost killed my poor mother; but if Jesus can save  to the uttermost, He can save him. And I want you to come right to our  house now.'    \"I took my hat and followed my little guide who trotted on before, halting  as she turned the corners to see that I was coming. Oh, what a miserable  den her home was! A low, dark, underground room, the floor all slush and  mud--not a chair, table, or bed to be seen. A bitter cold night and not  a spark of fire on the hob and the room not only cold but dark. In the  corner on a little dirty straw lay a woman. Her head was bound up, and  she was moaning as if in agony. As we darkened the doorway a feeble voice  said: 'Oh, my child! my child! why have you brought a stranger into this  horrible place?' Her story was a sad one, but soon told. Her husband,  out of work, maddened with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],[0,"The Clicking of Cuthbert (#11)"],[1,"ball anywhere?\"    \"A ball?\" I backed away, reaching for the door-handle. \"My dear boy,\" I  said, soothingly, \"you have made a mistake. Quite a natural mistake.  One anybody would have made. But, as a matter of fact, this is the  club-house. The links are outside there. Why not come away with me very  quietly and let us see if we can't find some balls on the links? If you  will wait here a moment, I will call up Doctor Smithson. He was telling  me only this morning that he wanted a good spell of ball-hunting to put  him in shape. You don't mind if he joins us?\"    \"It was a Silver King with my initials on it,\" Mortimer went on, not  heeding me. \"I got on the ninth green in eleven with a nice  mashie-niblick, but my approach-putt was a little too strong. It came  in through that window.\"    I perceived for the first time that one of the windows facing the  course was broken, and my relief was great. I went down on my knees and  helped him in his search. We ran the ball to earth finally inside the  piano.    \"What's the local rule?\" inquired Mortimer. \"Must I play it where it  lies, or may I tee up and lose a stroke? If I have to play it where it  lies, I suppose a niblick would be the club?\"    It was at this moment that Betty came in. One glance at her pale, set  face told me that there was to be a scene, and I would have retired,  but that she was between me and the door.    \"Hallo, dear,\" said Mortimer, greeting her with a friendly waggle of  his niblick. \"I'm bunkered in the piano. My approach-putt was a little  strong, and I over-ran the green.\"    \"Mortimer,\" said the girl, tensely, \"I want to ask you one question.\"    \"Yes, dear? I wish, darling, you could have seen my drive at the eighth  just now. It was a pip!\"    Betty looked at him steadily.    \"Are we engaged,\" she said, \"or are we not?\"    \"Engaged? Oh, to be married? Why, of course. I tried the open stance  for a change, and----\"    \"This morning you promised to take me for a ride. You never appeared.  Where were you?\"    \"Just playing golf.\"    \"Golf! I'm sick of the very name!\"    A spasm shook Mortimer.    \"You mustn't let people hear you saying things like that!\" he said. \"I  somehow felt, the moment I began my up-swing, that everything was going  to be all right. I----\"    \"I'll give you one more chance. Will you take me for a drive in your  car this evening?\"    \"I can't.\"    \"Why not? What are you doing?\"    \"Just playing golf!\"    \"I'm tired of being neglected like this!\" cried Betty, stamping her  foot. Poor girl, I saw her point of view. It was bad enough for her  being engaged to the wrong man, without having him treat her as a mere  acquaintance. Her conscience fighting with her love for Eddie Denton  had kept her true to Mortimer, and Mortimer accepted the sacrifice with  an absent-minded carelessness which would have been galling to any  girl. \"We might just as well not be engaged at all. You never take me  anywhere.\"    \"I asked you to come with me to watch the Open Championship.\"    \"Why don't you ever take me to dances?\"    \"I can't dance.\"    \"You could learn.\"    \"But I'm not sure if dancing is a good thing for a fellow's game. You  never hear of any first-class pro. dancing. James Braid doesn't dance.\"    \"Well, my mind's made up. Mortimer, you must choose between golf and  me.\"    \"But, darling, I went round in a hundred and one yesterday. You can't  expect a fellow to give up golf when he's at the top of his game.\"    \"Very well. I have nothing more to say. Our engagement is at an end.\"    \"Don't throw me over, Betty,\" pleaded Mortimer, and there was that in  his voice which cut me to the heart. \"You'll make me so miserable. And,  when I'm miserable, I always slice my approach shots.\"    Betty Weston drew herself up. Her face was hard.    \"Here is your ring!\" she said, and swept from the room.           *       *       *       *       *    For a moment after she had gone Mortimer remained very still, looking  at the glistening circle in his hand. I stole across the room and  patted his shoulder.    \"Bear up, my boy, bear up!\" I said.    He looked at me piteously.    \"Stymied!\" he muttered.    \"Be brave!\"    He went on, speaking as if to himself.    \"I had pictured--ah, how often I had pictured!--our little home! Hers  and mine. She sewing in her arm-chair, I practising putts on the  hearth-rug----\" He choked. \"While in the corner, little Harry Vardon  Sturgis played with little J. H. Taylor Sturgis. And round the  room--reading, busy with their childish tasks--little George Duncan  Sturgis, Abe Mitchell Sturgis, Harold Hilton Sturgis, Edward Ray  Sturgis, Horace Hutchinson Sturgis, and little James Braid Sturgis.\"    \"My boy! My boy!\" I cried.    \"What's the matter?\"    \"Weren't you giving yourself rather a large family?\"    He shook his head moodily.    \"Was I?\" he said, dully. \"I don't know. What's bogey?\"    There was a silence.    \"And yet----\" he said, at last, in a low voice. He paused. An odd,  bright look had come into his eyes. He seemed suddenly to be himself  again, the old, happy Mortimer Sturgis I had known so well. \"And yet,\"  he said, \"who knows? Perhaps it is all for the best. They might all  have turned out tennis-players!\" He raised his niblick again, his face  aglow. \"Playing thirteen!\" he said. \"I think the game here would be to  chip out through the door and work round the club-house to the green,  don't you?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Little remains to be told. Betty and Eddie have been happily married  for years. Mortimer's handicap is now down to eighteen, and he is  improving all the time. He was not present at the wedding, being  unavoidably detained by a medal tournament; but, if you turn up the  files and look at the list of presents, which were both numerous and  costly, you will see--somewhere in the middle of the column, the words:      STURGIS, J. MORTIMER.      _Two dozen Silver King Golf-balls and one patent Sturgis           Aluminium Self-Adjusting, Self-Compensating Putting-Cleek._          4    _Sundered Hearts_      In the smoking-room of the club-house a cheerful fire was burning, and  the Oldest Member glanced from time to time out of the window into the  gathering dusk. Snow was falling lightly on the links. From where he  sat, the Oldest Member had a good view of the ninth green; and  presently, out of the greyness of the December evening, there appeared  over the brow of the hill a golf-ball. It trickled across the green,  and stopped within a yard of the hole. The Oldest Member nodded  approvingly. A good approach-shot.    A young man in a tweed suit clambered on to the green, holed out with  easy confidence, and, shouldering his bag, made his way to the  club-house. A few moments later he entered the smoking-room, and  uttered an exclamation of rapture at the sight of the fire.    \"I'm frozen stiff!\"    He rang for a waiter and ordered a hot drink. The Oldest Member gave a  gracious assent to the suggestion that he should join him.    \"I like playing in winter,\" said the young man. \"You get the course to  yourself, for the world is full of slackers who only turn out when the  weather suits them. I cannot understand where they get the nerve to  call themselves golfers.\"    \"Not everyone is as keen as you are, my boy,\" said the Sage, dipping  gratefully into his hot drink. \"If they were, the world would be a  better place, and we should hear less of all this modern unrest.\"    \"I _am_ pretty keen,\" admitted the young man.    \"I have only encountered one man whom I could describe as keener. I  allude to Mortimer Sturgis.\"    \"The fellow who took up golf at thirty-eight and let the girl he was  engaged to marry go off with someone else because he hadn't the time to  combine golf with courtship? I remember. You were telling me about him  the other day.\"    \"There is a sequel to that story, if you would care to hear it,\" said  the Oldest Member.    \"You have the honour,\" said the young man. \"Go ahead!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Some people (began the Oldest Member) considered that Mortimer Sturgis  was too wrapped up in golf, and blamed him for it. I could never see  eye to eye with them. In the days of King Arthur nobody thought the  worse of a young knight if he suspended all his social and business  engagements in favour of a search for the Holy Grail. In the Middle  Ages a man could devote his whole life to the Crusades, and the public  fawned upon him. Why, then, blame the man of today for a zealous  attention to the modern equivalent, the Quest of Scratch! Mortimer  Sturgis never became a scratch player, but he did eventually get his  handicap down to nine, and I honour him for it.    The story which I am about to tell begins in what might be called the  middle period of Sturgis's career. He had reached the stage when his  handicap was a wobbly twelve; and, as you are no doubt aware, it is  then that a man really begins to golf in the true sense of the word.  Mortimer's fondness for the game until then had been merely tepid  compared with what it became now. He had played a little before, but  now he really buckled to and got down to it. It was at this point, too,  that he began once more to entertain thoughts of marriage. A profound  statistician in this one department, he had discovered that practically  all the finest exponents of the art are married men; and the thought  that there might be something in the holy state which improved a man's  game, and that he was missing a good thing, troubled him a great deal.  Moreover, the paternal instinct had awakened in him. As he justly  pointed out, whether marriage improved your game or not, it was to Old  Tom Morris's marriage that the existence of young Tommy Morris, winner  of the British Open Championship four times in succession, could be  directly traced. In fact, at the age of forty-two, Mortimer Sturgis was  in just the frame of mind to take some nice girl aside and ask her to"]]]
