If you are  near a pond-hole, or an old hogshead that collects rain water, you can  find a good many little animals, some of them very frisky--young  mosquitoes or \"polywogs,\" water-fleas, cyclops, little worms, young  dragon-flies and lots of others. When you go to collect them take a  small wide-mouth bottle and, having found a place where there is what  you want, lower your bottle, mouth down, in the midst of them and when  it is well under water turn the mouth upwards. A good many of the  animals will run in with the water. If the first time you do not get  what you want, the second time you may. When you want to examine them at  home you can fish them out with a glass tube and put them in a watch  crystal or on the glass stage of the microscope. In using the tube take  it between the thumb and middle and third fingers, and close the top  with your first finger; then put the lower end of the tube in the water  close to the thing you want to catch; now lift your first finger quickly  and the water will run in the lower end of the tube carrying with it  your little squirmer, unless he has been too quick for you. Close the  top of your tube again and the water will not run out when you remove  the tube, until you lift your finger. Sometimes it takes a good deal of  patience and skill to catch the more agile of the little water animals.  Glass tubes are sold in drug stores for five or ten cents.    If you begin by examining the objects already spoken of, you will while  looking for these be continually discovering for yourselves new objects  possessing new beauties and will soon see that not half the interesting  things you can find have been ever hinted at.    The way to find out about all these things is to go out into the fields  and woods, and form the habit of observing closely what is around you.  Carry your magnifier along and look at this flower, that fern, this  insect, that moss, with different powers of the magnifier; and when you  come across any objects worthy of a more careful examination carry them  home and examine them systematically with Simple microscope, needles,  knife, and so forth. Insects may be kept well in alcohol until winter,  and then careful studies may be made of them.    When using the magnifier in the field, hold it in such a way that the  smallest lens will be nearest the object when the lenses are combined  and be careful not to shade the object with the hand or the hat brim.  Just enough light should fall on the object to make its examination  comfortable for the eyes. If you rest the hand holding the magnifier on  the hand that holds the object, both lens and object can be held much  steadier. When commencing to examine an object it is best to have the  three lenses spread apart, for in this way you can use first the lowest  power then those higher and finally, if you wish to, the three lenses  combined. The dissecting forceps are very handy to have in the field,  both for picking up anything too small for the fingers and for holding  an object to be examined.    A collection of some of these little things preserved and ready for  examination adds greatly to the pleasures of studying them. Of course  all the different kinds of objects cannot be preserved so as to show  their full beauty, but many can be and the following directions will  tell how to make a very good collection:    Seeds, fern-fruit, insects and other opaque objects like these may be  mounted on pasteboard slides. One of these slides consists simply of a  stout piece of pasteboard, having a hole cut in the centre and a piece  of thick paper or cardboard glued on the under side. The object is  attached to the cardboard at the bottom of the hole.    It is best to make a number of these slides at a time. Having procured  some quite thick pasteboard, from old paper boxes, rule lines on the  surface dividing it up into spaces three inches long by one inch wide.  In the centre of each space cut out a hole about half an inch in  diameter. A sharp knife will make a neat square hole or a good round one  may be made with a gun-wad punch. This done, the spaces may be cut apart  with a sharp knife and ruler, along the lines already drawn. Pieces of  cardboard for the backs should be cut a trifle larger than the  pasteboard portion of the slide; after they are glued onto the latter  they may be trimmed down neatly with a pair of scissors. Glue or  mucilage containing glycerine (in the proportion of one or two  teaspoonfuls to an ordinary bottle of mucilage) is the best thing to use  for sticking on the backs. While the slides are drying they should be  either under a weight or in a clamp screwed up tightly, so as to prevent  their twisting out of shape. The mucilage may be prevented from being  squeezed in round the edges of the hole, by taking care when putting it  on not to have it come too near the hole. One or two coats of India Ink  may be painted on the middle of some of the pieces of cardboard, either  before or after they are put onto the slides; and thus a black  background may be obtained for the lighter-colored opaque objects. Many  of the objects will however show best on a white background.    When you have the slides all made, nothing more is needed to mount an  object, than simply to attach it to the bottom of the hole with a  little mucilage and glycerine, or something of that sort, and finally to  write the name of the object on the front part of the slide, and on the  back any desirable notes. A good way to mount such objects as fine seeds  is to put them in the hole loosely and then cover them with a piece of  mica such as will be spoken of presently.    Objects which are to be examined by the light shining through them, for  example a bee's wing or a butterfly's scales, must be mounted on glass  slides.    A glass slide three inches by one is taken, on the centre is placed the  object; over this is laid a thin piece of clear mica three fourths of an  inch square, and this is attached to the glass by pasting narrow strips  of tissue paper around the edges of the cover, partly on the cover and  partly on the slide. Finally the slide is covered with some pretty  colored paper and labeled.    Two pieces of paper are needed to cover each slide. One for the under  part is cut about one and one half by three and one half inches, with a  hole in the centre (round or square). This piece is first pasted on,  the corners being cut and the edges brought over onto the front. The  upper piece, which has a hole in the centre similar to that in the lower  piece, and is cut a trifle larger than the three by one inch slide, is  next pasted on so that the hole will correspond with the one below. The  upper piece of paper is now trimmed down to the slide and the label  attached. Window glass will answer for the slides and you can get any  glazier to cut up a piece for you into the right-sized slips. Mica can  be bought at a stove store, in sheets which may be cut up into three  fourths of an inch squares with a pair of scissors. The mica should be  as clear as you can get it. You will find it handy to have some tissue  paper all mucilaged like postage stamps and cut up in strips the right  size ready to use. The same may be said of the colored paper covers and  the labels.    The dust may be excluded from the uncovered opaque objects by keeping  the mounted slides in small groups, held together by elastic bands. This  will also serve to classify them so that all the insects will be  together, all the seeds, and so on; and the transparent slides may also  be treated in the same way. When an elastic band wears out, it is no  great trouble to replace it.    In working with the Simple microscope there is a fine chance to display  ingenuity, not only in making the instruments and mounting the objects  but in discovering new things to look at and in seeing how much can be  found out about those things which are the most common.          FOOTNOTES:    [A] In these directions \"1-1/2 _in._ power\" means a lens having    a focus of 1-1/2 inches; \"1/2 _in._ power\" means a lens or combination    of lenses having a focus of 1/2 inch; and so on. All the different    powers mentioned in the directions may be obtained in the small-sized    3-lens, bellows form magnifier, either by using the lenses singly or    combined in different ways. The magnifying power of any single lens or    simple combination is easily found by dividing 10, by the focus in    inches. Thus the magnifying power of a 1/2 _in._ lens is found in this    way: 10/1/2 = 10x2/1 20. The lens magnifies therefore 20 diameters    _i. e._ makes an object appear twenty times as long and twenty times as    broad as it is.

Males call while floating on the water (Pl. 7, fig.  1); the call is a soft \"do-ing, do-ing\" with a rising tone on the last  note. Numerous individual egg masses were along the bank of a pond near  Tehuantepec; one large composite egg mass there had a surface area of  about one square meter (Pl. 7, fig. 2). The large series from Union  Hidalgo was obtained by digging specimens out of a dry sandy river bank  in the dry season. Some of the individuals were buried to a depth of 25  centimeters.    In life individuals from the Pacific lowlands were dull brown and gray;  those from Acayucan were dark chocolate brown to black with pink or red  blotches, forearms, and dorsal stripe. Not all specimens from the  Atlantic lowlands are so colored; individuals from Cordoba and  Mirador, Veracruz, are like those from Tehuantepec.      =Leptodactylus labialis= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Agua Caliente; Chivela (2); Matias Romero (12); 33       km.

ENE of Jesus Carranza; Novillero (3);       San Lorenzo (2).    Although _Leptodactylus labialis_ does not appear to be so abundant as  _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, the former was found throughout the  lowlands of the isthmus. In the dry season individuals were found along  streams, and in the rainy season breeding congregations were found in  rain pools, marshes, ponds, and even small puddles. The call is a slow  \"wort, wort, wort.\" Males call beneath the water and from beneath rocks  and from holes in the ground. The average snout-vent length of eight  adult males is 37.2 mm. A completely metamorphosed juvenile obtained at  Hueyapan on July 24, 1956, has a snout-vent length of 11 mm.      =Leptodactylus melanonotus= Hallowell         _Oaxaca_: Agua Caliente (25); Cerro Arenal (2); Cerro       Quiengola (3); Cerro San Pedro (3); Chivela (2); Coyol;       Juchitan; Matias Romero (11); Mixtequilla (2); Papaloapan       (2); Salazar (9); Salina Cruz; 11 km.

ENE of Jesus Carranza       (2); 20 km. SE of Minatitlan (2); Novillero; San Lorenzo       (6).    This frog is abundant throughout the lowlands of the isthmus, where in  the dry season individuals were found along streams and beneath rocks  at a spring seepage. In the rainy season males were calling from nearly  every bit of standing water. The call is a soft clicking sound  resembling that made by striking two small stones together. The average  snout-vent length of ten adult males is 41.8 mm. There is considerable  variation in the extent of the yellowish brown glandular areas on the  belly. Some have none, whereas others have a broad area on the chest, a  band along the flanks, and a thin band across the lower abdomen.  Individuals collected in the dry season vary in the same fashion as do  those collected in the rainy season, at which time they were breeding.  The glands are equally well-developed in adults of both sexes, and were  present in some juveniles with snout-vent lengths of less than 20 mm.  Apparently the development of the glands is not associated with  maturity, sex, or size.      =Diaglena reticulata= Taylor         _Oaxaca_: Cerro Arenal; Chivela; Salina Cruz (26); San       Antonio (3); Tehuantepec (2); 8.6 km. W of Tehuantepec (11);       Zarzamora.    Breeding congregations of this rare frog were found 8.6 kilometers west  of Tehuantepec on July 5, 1956, and at Salina Cruz on July 6, 1958.  Both choruses took place immediately after torrential rains. In both  instances the frogs were in and about open muddy pools in the scrub  forest (Pl. 5, fig. 2); males called from the bank near the water, and  clasping pairs were found only on land (Pl. 8, figs. 1-2). The call is  a loud, nasal \"braaa,\" two to three seconds in duration. Amplexus is  axillary.    The dorsal ground color is light yellowish green tending towards olive  on the head and fading to yellow on the flanks. The ventral surfaces,  including the vocal sac, are white; the iris is golden and flecked with  black. The present series agrees well with the description of  _reticulata_ (based on two specimens) given by Taylor (1942:60). A  detailed analysis of variation, comparison with related species, and  descriptions of tadpoles are reserved for a future report.      =Hyla baudini= Dumeril and Bibron         _Oaxaca_: Bisilana; Cerro Quiengola (2); Cerro San Pedro;       Coyol; Matias Romero (12); Mixtequilla; Rio Sarabia (7);       Salazar; San Antonio; 11 km. S of Santiago Chivela; Santo       Domingo (3); Tapanatepec (2); Tehuantepec (23); Tolosita.       _Veracruz_: Acayucan; Amatitlan; Ciudad Aleman (3);       Cosamaloapan (2); Cuatotolapam (15); 10 km.

Commonly found on both sides of the isthmus, this large tree frog  nearly always is associated with trees; it is not found in the  savannas, although it breeds in savannas adjacent to rainforest. It  appears to be somewhat more abundant in scrub forest than in  rainforest. In the daytime individuals were found under the outer  sheaths of banana plants, in the axils of leaves of elephant ears  (_Xanthosoma_), in cavities in trees, and on shaded limbs in the  forest. Recently metamorphosed individuals having snout-vent lengths  slightly more than 20 mm. were found in the latter part of July.      =Hyla ebraccata= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Donaji (17); 43 km. N of Matias Romero (27);       Sarabia (6); Tolosita (3); Ubero (17). _Veracruz_: Aquilera.    This small species was found only in forested areas, where calling  males were on bushes and trees around rain pools. The call is a harsh  squawk repeated at intervals of 15 to 20 seconds, followed by a minute  or more of silence, and then repeated. Clasping pairs were found on  bushes and in the water.    The dorsum bears a dark chocolate brown hour glass-shaped mark, which  in some individuals is broken into a large mark posteriorly and a  smaller triangular one on the head and nape. The dorsal ground color  varies from pale cream or ivory to yellow or tan. The intensity of the  dorsal pigmentation is subject to rather rapid change. The flanks,  hands, and anterior part of the venter are lemon yellow; the feet,  thighs, and posterior part of the venter are golden yellow. The dorsal  surface of the shank is yellow to tan with chocolate brown bars or  spots; the heel is pale yellow. There is a dark brown bar in the loreal  region and a dark brown bar extending posteriorly from the eye to a  point above the insertion of the forelimb. The iris is a copper color.  The toes are completely webbed; the fingers, one-third webbed. There is  a small axillary web that is evident when the forelimbs are at right  angles to the body. Twenty males have an average snout-vent length of  28.1 mm.; three females, 35.3 mm. There are no nuptial tuberosities on  the pollex of breeding males.    This species has been collected at Coyame and Catemaco in Los Tuxtlas  and at various localities in Tabasco; it apparently ranges eastward  from southern Veracruz, Mexico, in humid forests to El Peten,  Guatemala.      =Hyla loquax= Gaige and Stuart         _Oaxaca_: Donaji (7); 43 km. N of Matias Romero (21).       _Veracruz_: 19 km. N of Acayucan (4); Aquilera (3); 8 km. SW       of Coatzacoalcos (36); Cuototolapam (11); Naranja (13); San       Lorenzo (8).    In the isthmus this species is known only from the humid forests of the  Gulf lowlands; it is also known from Boca del Rio, Veracruz, and from  Teapa and Villa Hermosa, Tabasco.    Calling males were found on aquatic plants above the water in deep  ponds in the forest where it was necessary for the collector to wade  waist-deep in water to obtain them. The call is a loud \"hah-onk.\"  Individuals, when active at night, are yellowish tan above with light  olive green spots. The flanks, belly, and vocal sac are yellow, and the  anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs and webbing of the feet  are bright orange-red or tomato red. Individuals found during the day  are grayish brown with olive markings or reddish brown with black  markings. Sleeping individuals are ivory-gray with faint gray markings.  The iris is a bright copper color. Fifteen adult males have an average  snout-vent length of 41.7 mm.; they have no horny nuptial pads on the  pollex.    The relationships of this species are with _Hyla rickardsi_ Taylor, a  species known only from the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental in  the states of Puebla and Veracruz. The distinguishing characteristics  of these species are given in Table 1. Living individuals may be  distinguished immediately by the flash colors on the thighs--red in  _loquax_ and yellow in _rickardsi_. The calls of the two species are  distinctly different; that of _rickardsi_ is a high-pitched, loud  rattle continued for several seconds, notably different from the  goose-like honk of _loquax_.
