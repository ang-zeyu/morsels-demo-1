Laudonnière refused to listen to this request.  But he promised that  as soon as the two ships were finished they should be allowed to  set out in search of gold mines.    The mutineers separated with gloomy faces; they were by no means  satisfied with Laudonnière's answer, and the discontent was as deep  as ever.  Laudonnière now again became very ill and the malcontents  had it all their own way.  Soon nearly every one in the fort was on  their side, and they resolved to put an end to Laudonnière's tyranny.    Late one night about twenty men all armed to the teeth gathered  together and marched to Laudonnière's hut.  Arrived there they beat  loudly on the door demanding entrance.  But Laudonnière and his few  remaining friends knew well what this loud summons meant, and they  refused to open the door.  The mutineers, however, were not to be  easily held back; they forced open the door, wounding one man who  tried to hinder them, and in a few minutes with drawn swords in  hand, and angry scowls on their faces, they crowded round the sick  man's bed.  Then holding a gun at his throat they commanded him to  give them leave to set forth for Spanish waters.  But the stern old  Huguenot knew no fear.  Even with the muzzle of the gun against his  throat he refused to listen to the demands of the lawless crew.    His calmness drove them to fury.  With terrible threats, and more  terrible oaths, they dragged him from his bed.  Loading him with  fetters they carried him out of the fort, threw him into a boat  and rowed him out to the ship which lay anchored in the river.  All  the loyal colonists had by this time been disarmed, and the fort  was completely in the hands of the mutineers.  Their leader then drew  up a paper giving them leave to set forth to Spanish possessions.  And this he commanded Laudonnière to sign.    Laudonnière was completely in the power of the mutineers.  He was  a prisoner and ill, but his spirit was unbroken, and he refused to  sign.  Then the mutineers sent him a message saying that if he did  not sign they would come on board the ship and cut his throat.  So,  seeing no help for it, Laudonnière signed.    The mutineers were now greatly delighted at the success of their  schemes.  They made haste to finish the two little ships which they  had been building, and on the 8th of December they set sail.  As  they went they flung taunts at those who stayed behind, calling  them fools and dolts and other scornful names, and threatening  them with all manner of punishments should they refuse them free  entrance to the fort on their return.    As soon as the mutineers were gone Laudonnière's friends rowed out  to him, set him free from his fetters, and brought him back to the  colony.    They were now but a very small company, but they were at peace with  each other, and there was plenty to do.  So the weeks went quickly  by.  They finished the fort, and began to build two new ships to  take the place of those which the mutineers had stolen.  But they  never thought of tilling the ground and sowing seed to provide  bread for the future.  Thus more than three months passed.  Then one  day an Indian brought the news that a strange ship was in sight.  Laudonnière at once sent some men to find out what ship this might  be, and whether it was friend or foe.    It proved to be a Spanish vessel which the mutineers had captured  and which was now manned by them.  But the mutineers who had sailed  away full of pride and insolence now returned in very humble mood.  Their buccaneering had not succeeded as they had hoped.  They were  starving, and instead of boldly demanding entrance, and putting  in force their haughty threats, they were eager to make terms.  But  Laudonnière was not sure whether they really came in peace or not.  So he sent out a little boat to the mutineers' ship.  On the deck  of it there was an officer with one or two men only.  But below,  thirty men, all armed to the teeth, were hidden.  Seeing only these  one or two men in the boat the mutineers let her come alongside.  But what was their astonishment when armed men suddenly sprang from  the bottom of the boat and swarmed over the sides of their vessel.  Many of the mutineers were stupid with drink, all of them were  weak with hunger, and before they could seize their arms, or make  any resistance, they were overpowered and carried ashore.    There a court-martial was held, and four of the ringleaders were  condemned to death.  But these bold bad men were loath to die.    \"Comrades,\" said one, turning to the loyal soldiers near, \"will  you stand by and see us die thus shamefully?\"    \"These,\" replied Laudonnière, sharply, \"are no comrades of mutineers  and rebels.\"    All appeals for mercy were in vain.  So the men were shot and their  bodies hanged on gibbets near the mouth of the river as a lesson  to rebels.    After this there was peace for a time in Fort Caroline.  But it  soon became peace with misery, for the colony began to starve.  The  long-expected ship from France did not come.  Rich and fertile land  spread all round them, but the colonists had neither ploughed nor  sown it.  They trusted to France for all their food.  Now for months  no ships had come, and their supplies were utterly at an end.    So in ever increasing misery the days passed.  Some crawled about the  meadows and forest, digging for roots and gathering herbs.  Others  haunted the river bed in search of shell-fish.  One man even gathered  up all the fish bones he could find and ground them to powder to  make bread.  But all that they scraped together with so much pain  and care was hardly enough to keep body and soul together.  They  grew so thin that their bones started through the skin.  Gaunt,  hollow-eyed spectres they lay about the fort sunk in misery, or  dragged themselves a little way into the forest in search of food.  Unless help came from France they knew that they must all soon die  a miserable death.  And amid all their misery they clung to that  last hope, that help would come from France.  So, however feeble they  were, however faint with hunger, they would crawl in turns to the  top of the hill above the fort straining their dimming eyes seaward.  But no sail appeared.    At length they gave up all hope, and determined to leave the hated  spot.  They had the Spanish ship which the mutineers had captured,  and another little vessel besides which they had built.  But these  were not enough to carry them all to France, so gathering all their  last energy they began to build another boat.  The hope of getting  back to France seemed for a time to put a little strength into their  famine stricken bodies.  And while they worked Laudonnière sailed  up the river in search of food.  But he returned empty-handed.  Famishing men cannot work, and soon the colonists began to weary  of their labours.    The neighbouring Indians, too, who might have given them food, were  now their enemies.  They indeed now and again brought scant supplies  of fish to the starving men.  But they demanded so much for it that  soon the colonists were bare of everything they had possessed.  They  bartered the very shirts from their backs for food.  And if they  complained of the heavy price the Indians laughed at them.    \"If thou makest so great account of thy merchandise,\" they jeered,  \"eat it and we will eat our fish.\"    But summer passed.  The grain began to ripen, and although the Indians  sold it grudgingly the colony was relieved from utter misery for  the time being.    But now fresh troubles arose, for the Frenchmen quarreled with the  chief of the Thimagoes for whose sake they had already made enemies  of Satouriona and his Indians.    Thinking themselves treated in an unfriendly manner by the Thimagoes  the Frenchmen seized their chief, and kept him prisoner until the  Indians promised to pay a ransom of large quantities of grain.    The Indians agreed only because they saw no other means of freeing  their chief.  They were furiously angry with the Frenchmen and,  seething with indignation against them, they refused to pay an  ounce of grain until their chief had been set free: and even then  they would not bring it to Fort Caroline, but forced the Frenchmen  to come for it.  The Frenchmen went, but they very quickly saw  that they were in great danger.  For the village swarmed with armed  warriors who greeted the colonists with scowls of deepest hatred.  After a few days, therefore, although only a small portion of the  ransom had been paid, the Frenchmen decided to make for home as  fast as possible.    It was a hot July morning on which they set off.  Each man besides  his gun carried a sack of grain, so the progress was slow.  They had  not gone far beyond the village when a wild war whoop was heard.  It was immediately followed by a shower of arrows.  The Frenchmen  replied with a hot fire of bullets.  Several of the Indians fell  dead, and the rest fled howling into the forest.    Then the Frenchmen marched on again.  But they had scarcely gone  a quarter of a mile when another war whoop was heard in front.  It was answered from behind, and the Frenchmen knew themselves  surrounded.  But they stood their ground bravely.  Dropping their  bags of corn they seized their guns.  A sharp encounter followed,  and soon the Indians fled again into the forest.  But again and  again they returned to the attack, and the Frenchmen had to fight  every yard of the way.  At nine o'clock the fight began, and the sun  was setting when at length the Indians gave up the pursuit.  When  the Frenchmen reached their boats they counted their losses.  Two  had been killed, and twenty-two injured, some of them so badly  that they had to be carried on board the boats.  Of all the bags of  grain with which they had started out only two remained.  It was a  miserable ending to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#11)"],[1,"S. Fitch and Lewis L. Sandidge.
