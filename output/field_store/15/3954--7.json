How to gain her father's love was the constant subject of her thoughts,  and she tried in many ways to win his affection. She always yielded a  ready and cheerful obedience to his commands, and strove to anticipate  and fulfil all his wishes. But he seldom noticed her, unless to give a  command or administer a rebuke, while he lavished many a caress upon  his little sister, Enna. Often Elsie would watch him fondling her,  until, unable any longer to control her feelings, she would rush away  to her own room to weep and mourn in secret, and pray that her father  might some day learn to love her. She never complained even to poor old  Aunt Chloe, but the anxious nurse watched all these things with the  jealous eye of affection; she saw that her child--as she delighted to  call her--was very unhappy, and was growing pale and melancholy; and  her heart ached for her, and many were the tears she shed in secret  over the sorrows of her nursling.    \"Don't 'pear so sorrowful, darlin',\" she sometimes said to her; \"try to  be merry, like Miss Enna, and run and jump on Massa Horace's knee, and  den I tink he will like you better.\"    \"O mammy! I _can't_,\" Elsie would say; \"I don't dare to do it.\"    And Chloe would sigh and shake her head sorrowfully.          CHAPTER FOURTH         \"With more capacity for love than earth      Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.\"                                   --BYRON.                                \"What are our hopes?     Like garlands, on afflictions's forehead worn,     Kissed in the morning, and at evening torn.\"                     --DAVENPORT'S _King John and Matilda._      Such had been the state of affairs for about a week, when one morning  Elsie and her father met at the breakfast-room door.    \"Good morning, papa,\" she said timidly.    \"Good morning, Elsie,\" he replied in an unusually pleasant tone.    Then, taking her by the hand, he led her in and seated her beside  himself at the table.    Elsie's cheek glowed and her eyes sparkled with pleasure.    There were several guests present, and she waited patiently while they  and the older members of the family were being helped. At length it was  her turn.    \"Elsie, will you have some meat?\" asked her grandfather.    \"No,\" said her father, answering for her; \"once a day is as often as a  child of her age ought to eat meat; she may have it at dinner, but  never for breakfast or tea.\"    The elder Mr. Dinsmore laughed, saying, \"Really, Horace, I had no idea  you were so notionate. I always allowed you to eat whatever you  pleased, and I never saw that it hurt you. But, of course, you must  manage your own child in your own way.\"    \"If you please, papa, I had rather have some of those hot cakes,\" said  Elsie, timidly, as her father laid a slice of bread upon her plate.    \"No,\" said he decidedly; \"I don't approve of hot bread for children;  you must eat the cold.\" Then to a servant who was setting down a cup of  coffee beside the little girl's plate, \"Take that away, Pomp, and bring  Miss Elsie a tumbler of milk. Or would you prefer water, Elsie?\"    \"Milk, if you please, papa,\" she replied with a little sigh; for she  was extremely fond of coffee, and it was something of a trial to give  it up.    Her father put a spoonful of stewed fruit upon her plate, and as Pompey  set down a tumbler of rich milk beside it, said, \"Now you have your  breakfast before you, Elsie. Children in England are not allowed to eat  butter until they are ten or eleven years of age, and I think it an  excellent plan, to make them grow up rosy and healthy. I have neglected  my little girl too long, but I intend to begin to take good care of her  now,\" he added, with a smile, and laying his hand for an instant upon  her head.    The slight caress and the few kind words were quite enough to reconcile  Elsie to the rather meagre fare, and she ate it with a happy heart. But  the meagre fare became a constant thing, while the caresses and kind  words were not; and though she submitted without a murmur, she could  not help sometimes looking with longing eyes at the coffee and hot  buttered rolls, of which she was very fond. But she tried to be  contented, saying to herself, \"Papa knows best, and I ought to be  satisfied with whatever he gives me.\"    \"Isn't it delightful to have your papa at home, Elsie?\" Mr. Dinsmore  one morning overheard Arthur saying to his little girl in a mocking  tone. \"It's very pleasant to live on bread and water, isn't it, eh?\"    \"I _don't_ live on bread and water,\" Elsie replied, a little  indignantly. \"Papa always allows me to have as much good, rich milk,  and cream, and fruit as I want, or I can have eggs, or cheese, or  honey, or anything else, except meat and hot cakes, and butter, and  coffee; and who wouldn't rather do without such things all their lives  than not have a papa to love them? And besides, you know, Arthur, that  I can have all the meat I want at dinner.\"    \"Pooh! that's nothing; and _I_ wouldn't give much for all the love  _you_ get from him,\" said Arthur, scornfully.    There was something like a sob from Elsie; and as her father rose and  went to the window, he just caught a glimpse of her white dress  disappearing down the garden walk.    \"What do you mean, sir, by teasing Elsie in that manner?\" he exclaimed  angrily to Arthur, who still stood where the little girl had left him,  leaning against one of the pillars of the portico.    \"I only wanted to have a little fun,\" returned the boy doggedly.    \"Well, sir, I don't approve of such fun, and you will please to let the  child alone in future,\" replied his brother as he returned to his  newspaper again.    But somehow the paper had lost its interest. He seemed constantly to  hear that little sob, and to see a little face all wet with tears of  wounded feeling.    Just then the school-bell rang, and suddenly throwing down his paper,  he took a card from his pocket, wrote a few words upon it, and calling  a servant, said, \"Take this to Miss Day.\"    Elsie was seated at her desk, beginning her morning's work, when the  servant entered and handed the card to the governess.    Miss Day glanced at it and said:    \"Elsie, your father wants you. You may go.\"    Elsie rose in some trepidation and left the room, wondering what her  papa could want with her.    \"Where is papa, Fanny?\" she asked of the servant.    \"In de drawin'-room, Miss Elsie,\" was the reply; and she hastened to  seek him there.    He held out his hand as she entered, saying with a smile, \"Come here,  daughter.\"    It was the first time he had called her that, and it sent a thrill of  joy to her heart.    She sprang to his side, and, taking her hand in one of his, and laying  the other gently on her head, and bending it back a little, he looked  keenly into her face. It was bright enough now, yet the traces of tears  were very evident.    \"You have been crying,\" he said, in a slightly reproving tone. \"I am  afraid you do a great deal more of that than is good for you. It is a  very babyish habit, and you must try to break yourself of it.\"    The little face flushed painfully, and the eyes filled again.    \"There,\" he said, stroking her hair, \"don't begin it again. I am going  to drive over to Ion, where your friend Mr. Travilla lives, to spend  the day; would my little daughter like to go with me?\"    \"Oh! so _very_ much, papa!\" she answered eagerly.    \"There are no little folks there,\" he said smiling, \"nobody to see but  Mr. Travilla and his mother. But I see you want to go; so run and ask  Aunt Chloe to get you ready. Tell her I want you nicely dressed, and  the carriage will be at the door in half an hour.\"    Elsie bounded away to do his bidding, her face radiant with happiness;  and at the specified time came down again, looking so very lovely that  her father gazed at her with proud delight, and could not refrain from  giving her a kiss as he lifted her up to place her in the carriage.    Then, seating himself beside her, he took her hand in his; and, closing  the door with the other, bade the coachman drive on.    \"I suppose you have never been to Ion, Elsie?\" he said, inquiringly.    \"No, sir; but I have heard Aunt Adelaide say she thought it a very  pretty place,\" replied the little girl.    \"So it is--almost as pretty as Roselands,\" said her father. \"Travilla  and I have known each other from boyhood, and I spent many a happy day  at Ion, and we had many a boyish frolic together, before I ever thought  of you.\"    He smiled, and patted her cheek as he spoke.    Elsie's eyes sparkled. \"O papa!\" she said eagerly; \"won't you tell me  about those times? It seems so strange that you were ever a little boy  and I was nowhere.\"    He laughed. Then said, musingly, \"It seems but a very little while to  me, Elsie, since I was no older than you are now.\"    He heaved a sigh, and relapsed into silence.    Elsie wished very much that he would grant her request, but did not  dare to disturb him by speaking a word; and they rode on quietly for  some time, until a squirrel darting up a tree caught her eye, and she  uttered an exclamation. \"O papa! did you see that squirrel? look at him  now, perched up on that branch. There, we have passed the tree, and now  he is out of sight.\"    This reminded Mr. Dinsmore of a day he had spent in those woods hunting  squirrels, when quite a boy, and he gave Elsie an animated account of  it. One of the incidents of the day had been the accidental discharge  of the fowling-piece of one of his young companions, close at Horace  Dinsmore's side, missing him by but a hair's breadth.    \"I felt faint and sick when I knew how near I had been to death,\" he  said, as he finished his narrative.    Elsie had been listening with breathless interest.    \"Dear papa,\" she murmured, laying her little cheek against his hand,  \"how good God was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],[0,"An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#11)"],[1,"wrapper is  of cloth made of twine doubled and twisted. But the thread does not  appear to have been formed by the wheel, nor the web by the loom. The  warp and filling seem to have been crossed and knotted by an operation  like that of the fabricks of the northwest coast, and of the Sandwich  islands. Such a botanist as the lamented Muhlenburgh could determine  the plant which furnished the fibrous material.    \"The innermost tegument is a mantle of cloth like the preceding, but  furnished with large brown feathers arranged and fastened with great  art so as to be capable of guarding the living wearer from wet and  cold. The plumage is distinct and entire, and the whole bears a near  similitude to the feathery cloaks now worn by the nations of the  northwestern coast of America. A Wilson might tell from what bird they  were derived.    \"The body is in a squatting posture with the right arm reclining  forward and its hand encircling the right leg. The left arm hangs  down, with its hand inclined partly under the seat. The individual,  who was a male did not probably exceed the age of fourteen, at his  death. There is near the occiput a deep and extensive fracture of the  skull, which probably killed him. The skin has sustained little  injury, it is of a dusky colour, but the natural hue cannot be decided  with exactness from its present appearance. The scalp, with small  exceptions is cohered with sorrel or foxy hair. The teeth are white  and sound. The hands and feet, in their shrivelled state, are slender  and delicate. All this is worthy the investigation of our acute and  perspicacious colleague, Dr Holmes.    \"There is nothing bituminous or aromatic in or about the body, like the  Egyptian mummies, nor are there bandages around any part. Except the  several wrappers, the body is totally naked. There is no sign of a  suture or incision about the belly whence it seems that the viscera  were not removed.    \"It may now be expected that I should offer some opinion, as to the  antiquity and race of this singular exsiccation.    \"First, then, I am satisfied that it does not belong to that class of  white men of which we are members.    \"2dly. Nor do I believe that it ought to be referred to the bands of  Spanish adventurers, who, between the years 1500 and 1600, rambled up  the Mississippi, and along its tributary streams. But on this head I  should like to know the opinion of my learned and sagacious friend,  Noah Webster.    \"3dly. I am equally obliged to reject the opinion that it belonged to  any of the tribes of aborigines, now or lately inhabiting Kentucky.    \"4thly. The mantle of the feathered work, and the mantle of twisted  threads, so nearly resemble the fabricks of the indigines of Wakash  and the Pacifick islands, that I refer this individual to that era of  time, and that generation of men, which preceded the Indians of the  Green River, and of the place where these relicks were found. This  conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that such manufactures  are not prepared by the actual and resident red men of the present  day. If the Abbe Clavigero had had this case before him, he would have  thought of the people who constructed those ancient forts and mounds,  whose exact history no man living can give. But I forbear to enlarge;  my intention being merely to manifest my respect to the society for  having enrolled me among its members, and to invite the attention of  its Antiquarians to further inquiry on a subject of such curiosity.    \"With respect, I remain yours,    \"SAMUEL L. MITCHILL\"    It would appear from recent researches on the Northwest coast that the  natives of that region embalmed their dead with much care, as may be  seen from the work recently published by W. H. Dall, [Footnote: Cont.  to N. A. Ethnol., 1877, vol. 1, p. 89] the description of the mummies  being as follows:    \"We found the dead disposed of in various ways; first, by interment in  their compartments of the communal dwelling, as already described;  second, by being laid on a rude platform of drift-wood or stones in  some convenient rock shelter. These lay on straw and moss, covered by  matting, and rarely have either implements, weapons, or carvings  associated with them. We found only three or four specimens in all in  these places, of which we examined a great number. This was apparently  the more ancient form of disposing of the dead, and one which more  recently was still pursued in the case of poor or unpopular  individuals.    \"Lastly, in comparatively modern times, probably within a few  centuries, and up to the historic period (1740), another mode was  adopted for the wealthy, popular, or more distinguished class. The  bodies were eviscerated, cleansed from fatty matters in running water,  dried, and usually placed in suitable cases in wrappings of fur and  fine grass matting The body was usually doubled up into the smallest  compass, and the mummy case, especially in the case of children, was  usually suspended (so as not to touch the ground) in some convenient  rock shelter. Sometimes, however, the prepared body was placed in a  lifelike position, dressed and armed. They were placed as if engaged  in some congenial occupation, such as hunting, fishing, sewing, etc.  With them were also placed effigies of the animals they were pursuing,  while the hunter was dressed in his wooden armor and provided with an  enormous mask, all ornamented with feathers and a countless variety of  wooden pendants, colored in gay patterns. All the carvings were of  wood, the weapons even were only fac-similes in wood of the original  articles. Among the articles represented were drums, rattles, dishes,  weapons, effigies of men, birds, fish, and animals, wooden armor of  rods or scales of wood, and remarkable masks, so arranged that the  wearer when erect could only see the ground at his feet. These were  worn at their religious dances from an idea that a spirit which was  supposed to animate a temporary idol was fatal to whoever might look  upon it while so occupied. An extension of the same idea led to the  masking of those who had gone into the land of spirits.    \"The practice of preserving the bodies of those belonging to the  whaling class--a custom peculiar to the Kadiak Innuit--has erroneously  been confounded with the one now described. The latter included women  as well as men, and all those whom the living desired particularly to  honor. The whalers, however, only preserved the bodies of males, and  they were not associated with the paraphernalia of those I have  described. Indeed, the observations I have been able to make show the  bodies of the whalers to have been preserved with stone weapons and  actual utensils instead of effigies, and with the meanest apparel, and  no carvings of consequence. These details, and those of many other  customs and usages of which the shell heaps bear no testimony ... do  not come within my line.\"    Martin Sauer, secretary to Billings' Expedition [Footnote: Billings'  Exped. 1802, p. 167.] in 1802, speaks of the Aleutian Islanders  embalming their dead, as follows:    \"They pay respect, however, to the memory of the dead, for they embalm  the bodies of the men with dried moss and grass; bury them in their  best attire, in a sitting posture, in a strong box, with their darts  and instruments; and decorate the tomb with various coloured mats,  embroidery, and paintings. With women, indeed, they use less ceremony.  A mother will keep a dead child thus embalmed in their hut for some  months, constantly wiping it dry; and they bury it when it begins to  smell, or when they get reconciled to parting with it.\"    Regarding these same people, a writer in the San Francisco Bulletin  gives this account-    \"The schooner William Sutton, belonging to the Alaska Commercial  Company, has arrived from the seal islands of the company with the  mummified remains of Indians who lived on an island north of Ounalaska  one hundred and fifty years ago. This contribution to science was  secured by Captain Henning, an agent of the company, who has long  resided at Ounalaska. In his transactions with the Indians he learned  that tradition among the Aleuts assigned Kagamale, the island in  question, as the last resting-place of a great chief, known as  Karkhayahouchak. Last year the captain was in the neighborhood of  Kagamale, in quest of sea-otter and other furs and he bore up for the  island, with the intention of testing the truth of the tradition he  had heard. He had more difficulty in entering the cave than in finding  it, his schooner having to beat on and off shore for three days.  Finally, he succeeded in effecting a landing, and clambering up the  rocks he found himself in the presence of the dead chief, his family  and relatives.    \"The cave smelt strongly of hot sulphurous vapors. With great care the  mummies were removed, and all the little trinkets and ornaments  scattered around were also taken away.    \"In all there are eleven packages of bodies. Only two or three have as  yet been opened. The body of the chief is inclosed in a large basket-  like structure, about four feet in height. Outside the wrappings are  finely-wrought sea-grass matting, exquisitely close in texture, and  skins. At the bottom is a broad hoop or basket of thinly-cut wood, and  adjoining the center portions are pieces of body armor composed of  reeds bound together. The body is covered with the fine skin of the  sea-otter, always a mark of distinction in the interments of the  Aleuts, and round the whole package are stretched the meshes of a  fish-net, made of the sinews of the sea lion; also those of a bird-  net. There are evidently some bulky articles inclosed with the chief's  body, and the whole package differs very much from the others, which  more resemble, in their brown-grass matting, consignments of crude  sugar from the Sandwich Islands than the remains of human beings.
