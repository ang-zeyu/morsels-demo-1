The important thing, he said, was to keep your feet  warm. On very cold nights Thea always put a brick in the oven after  supper, and when she went upstairs she wrapped it in an old flannel  petticoat and put it in her bed. The boys, who would never heat bricks  for themselves, sometimes carried off Thea's, and thought it a good joke  to get ahead of her.    When Thea first plunged in between her red blankets, the cold sometimes  kept her awake for a good while, and she comforted herself by  remembering all she could of \"Polar Explorations,\" a fat, calf-bound  volume her father had bought from a book-agent, and by thinking about  the members of Greely's party: how they lay in their frozen  sleeping-bags, each man hoarding the warmth of his own body and trying  to make it last as long as possible against the on-coming cold that  would be everlasting. After half an hour or so, a warm wave crept over  her body and round, sturdy legs; she glowed like a little stove with the  warmth of her own blood, and the heavy quilts and red blankets grew warm  wherever they touched her, though her breath sometimes froze on the  coverlid. Before daylight, her internal fires went down a little, and  she often wakened to find herself drawn up into a tight ball, somewhat  stiff in the legs. But that made it all the easier to get up.    The acquisition of this room was the beginning of a new era in Thea's  life. It was one of the most important things that ever happened to her.  Hitherto, except in summer, when she could be out of doors, she had  lived in constant turmoil; the family, the day school, the  Sunday-School. The clamor about her drowned the voice within herself. In  the end of the wing, separated from the other upstairs sleeping-rooms by  a long, cold, unfinished lumber room, her mind worked better. She  thought things out more clearly. Pleasant plans and ideas occurred to  her which had never come before. She had certain thoughts which were  like companions, ideas which were like older and wiser friends. She left  them there in the morning, when she finished dressing in the cold, and  at night, when she came up with her lantern and shut the door after a  busy day, she found them awaiting her. There was no possible way of  heating the room, but that was fortunate, for otherwise it would have  been occupied by one of her older brothers.    From the time when she moved up into the wing, Thea began to live a  double life. During the day, when the hours were full of tasks, she was  one of the Kronborg children, but at night she was a different person.  On Friday and Saturday nights she always read for a long while after she  was in bed. She had no clock, and there was no one to nag her.    Ray Kennedy, on his way from the depot to his boardinghouse, often  looked up and saw Thea's light burning when the rest of the house was  dark, and felt cheered as by a friendly greeting. He was a faithful  soul, and many disappointments had not changed his nature. He was still,  at heart, the same boy who, when he was sixteen, had settled down to  freeze with his sheep in a Wyoming blizzard, and had been rescued only  to play the losing game of fidelity to other charges.    Ray had no very clear idea of what might be going on in Thea's head, but  he knew that something was. He used to remark to Spanish Johnny, \"That  girl is developing something fine.\" Thea was patient with Ray, even in  regard to the liberties he took with her name. Outside the family, every  one in Moonstone, except Wunsch and Dr. Archie, called her \"Thee-a,\" but  this seemed cold and distant to Ray, so he called her \"Thee.\" Once, in a  moment of exasperation, Thea asked him why he did this, and he explained  that he once had a chum, Theodore, whose name was always abbreviated  thus, and that since he was killed down on the Santa Fe, it seemed  natural to call somebody \"Thee.\" Thea sighed and submitted. She was  always helpless before homely sentiment and usually changed the subject.    It was the custom for each of the different Sunday Schools in Moonstone  to give a concert on Christmas Eve. But this year all the churches were  to unite and give, as was announced from the pulpits, \"a semi-sacred  concert of picked talent\" at the opera house. The Moonstone Orchestra,  under the direction of Professor Wunsch, was to play, and the most  talented members of each Sunday School were to take part in the  programme. Thea was put down by the committee \"for instrumental.\" This  made her indignant, for the vocal numbers were always more popular. Thea  went to the president of the committee and demanded hotly if her rival,  Lily Fisher, were going to sing. The president was a big, florid,  powdered woman, a fierce W.C.T.U. worker, one of Thea's natural enemies.  Her name was Johnson; her husband kept the livery stable, and she was  called Mrs. Livery Johnson, to distinguish her from other families of  the same surname. Mrs. Johnson was a prominent Baptist, and Lily Fisher  was the Baptist prodigy. There was a not very Christian rivalry between  the Baptist Church and Mr. Kronborg's church.    When Thea asked Mrs. Johnson whether her rival was to be allowed to  sing, Mrs. Johnson, with an eagerness which told how she had waited for  this moment, replied that \"Lily was going to recite to be obliging, and  to give other children a chance to sing.\" As she delivered this thrust,  her eyes glittered more than the Ancient Mariner's, Thea thought. Mrs.  Johnson disapproved of the way in which Thea was being brought up, of a  child whose chosen associates were Mexicans and sinners, and who was, as  she pointedly put it, \"bold with men.\" She so enjoyed an opportunity to  rebuke Thea, that, tightly corseted as she was, she could scarcely  control her breathing, and her lace and her gold watch chain rose and  fell \"with short, uneasy motion.\" Frowning, Thea turned away and walked  slowly homeward. She suspected guile. Lily Fisher was the most stuck-up  doll in the world, and it was certainly not like her to recite to be  obliging. Nobody who could sing ever recited, because the warmest  applause always went to the singers.    However, when the programme was printed in the Moonstone GLEAM, there it  was: \"Instrumental solo, Thea Kronborg. Recitation, Lily Fisher.\"    Because his orchestra was to play for the concert, Mr. Wunsch imagined  that he had been put in charge of the music, and he became arrogant. He  insisted that Thea should play a \"Ballade\" by Reinecke. When Thea  consulted her mother, Mrs. Kronborg agreed with her that the \"Ballade\"  would \"never take\" with a Moonstone audience. She advised Thea to play  \"something with variations,\" or, at least, \"The Invitation to the  Dance.\"    \"It makes no matter what they like,\" Wunsch replied to Thea's  entreaties. \"It is time already that they learn something.\"    Thea's fighting powers had been impaired by an ulcerated tooth and  consequent loss of sleep, so she gave in. She finally had the molar  pulled, though it was a second tooth and should have been saved. The  dentist was a clumsy, ignorant country boy, and Mr. Kronborg would not  hear of Dr. Archie's taking Thea to a dentist in Denver, though Ray  Kennedy said he could get a pass for her. What with the pain of the  tooth, and family discussions about it, with trying to make Christmas  presents and to keep up her school work and practicing, and giving  lessons on Saturdays, Thea was fairly worn out.    On Christmas Eve she was nervous and excited. It was the first time she  had ever played in the opera house, and she had never before had to face  so many people. Wunsch would not let her play with her notes, and she  was afraid of forgetting. Before the concert began, all the participants  had to assemble on the stage and sit there to be looked at. Thea wore  her white summer dress and a blue sash, but Lily Fisher had a new pink  silk, trimmed with white swansdown.    The hall was packed. It seemed as if every one in Moonstone was there,  even Mrs. Kohler, in her hood, and old Fritz. The seats were wooden  kitchen chairs, numbered, and nailed to long planks which held them  together in rows. As the floor was not raised, the chairs were all on  the same level. The more interested persons in the audience peered over  the heads of the people in front of them to get a good view of the  stage. From the platform Thea picked out many friendly faces. There was  Dr. Archie, who never went to church entertainments; there was the  friendly jeweler who ordered her music for her,--he sold accordions and  guitars as well as watches,--and the druggist who often lent her books,  and her favorite teacher from the school. There was Ray Kennedy, with a  party of freshly barbered railroad men he had brought along with him.  There was Mrs. Kronborg with all the children, even Thor, who had been  brought out in a new white plush coat. At the back of the hall sat a  little group of Mexicans, and among them Thea caught the gleam of  Spanish Johnny's white teeth, and of Mrs. Tellamantez's lustrous,  smoothly coiled black hair.    After the orchestra played \"Selections from Erminie,\" and the Baptist  preacher made a long prayer, Tillie Kronborg came on with a highly  colored recitation, \"The Polish Boy.\" When it was over every one  breathed more freely. No committee had the courage to leave Tillie off a  programme. She was accepted as a trying feature of every entertainment.  The Progressive Euchre Club was the only social organization in the town  that entirely escaped Tillie. After Tillie sat down, the Ladies'  Quartette sang, \"Beloved, it is Night,\" and then it was Thea's turn.    The \"Ballade\" took ten minutes, which was five minutes too long. The  audience grew restive and fell to whispering. Thea could hear Mrs.  Livery Johnson's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44114"],[0,"A Jay of Italy (#11)"],[1,"in his rage, on the boy.    'Who art thou?' he thundered at length.    'Bernardo Bembo.'    The clear voice was like the call of a bird's through tempest.    'Whence comest thou?'    'From San Zeno in the hills.'    'What seek'st thou here?'    'Thy cure.'    The Duke started, and seemed actually to crouch for a moment.  Then,  while all held their breath in fear, of a sudden he fell back, and  gripped a hand to his heart, and muttered, staring: 'The face!'    He closed his eyes, and passed a tremulous hand across his brow before  he looked again; and lo! when he did so, the madness was past.    'Child,' he said hoarsely, almost whispered, 'what said'st thou?  Come  nearer: let me look at thee.'    He rose himself, with the word, stiffly, like an old man, and stood  before the boy, and gazing hungrily for a little into the solemn eyes,  dropped his own as if abashed--half-blinded.  In the background, Bona,  his wife, and the child Catherine clung together in a silence of fear  and wonder.    'Ah, I am haunted!' shuddered the tyrant.  'Who told thee that?  It is a  face, child, a face--there--in the dead watches of the night--behind  me--and by day, always the same, a damned clinging bur on my soul--not  to be shaken off--always behind me!'    He gave a little jerk and motion of repugnance, as if he were trying to  throw something off.  Carlo struck in: 'Lord, let him sing to thee!  I  say no more.'    The deep, gloomy eyes of the Duke were lifted one instant to the strange  seraph-gaze fixed silently upon him; then, making an acquiescent motion  with his hand, he turned, and sat himself down again as if exhausted,  and hid his brow under his palm.    Now the boy, never looking away, slung forward his lute, and like one  that charms a serpent, began softly to finger the strings.  And  Galeazzo's head, in very truth like an adder's, swung to the rhythm; and  as the chords rose piercing, he clutched his brow, and as they melted  and sobbed away, so did he sink and moan.  And then, suddenly, into that  wild symphony drew the voice, as a spray of sweetbriar is drawn into a  wheel; and all around caught their breath to listen:--        'Two children, a boy and girl, were playing between wood and              meadow.      They pledged their faith, each to the other, with rosy lips on              lips,      He to protect, she to trust--always together for ever and ever.      A storm rose: the dragon of the thunder roared and hissed,      Probing the earth with its keen tongue.      How she cowered, the pretty, fearful thing!      Yet adored her little love to see him dare      That tree-cleaving monster with his sword of lath.      And in the end, because she trusted in her love, her love              prevailed,      And drove the roaring terror from the woods.      She never felt such faith, nor he such pride of virtue in his              strength.      Then shone out the rainbow,      And he bethought him of the jewelled cup hid at its foot.      \"Stay here,\" quoth he, new boldened by his triumph,      \"And I'll fetch it ye.\"      But she cried to him: \"Nay, leveling, take me too!      We were to be aye together: O leave me not behind!\"      But he was already on his way.      And still, as he pursued, the rainbow fled before,      And the voice of his playmate, faint and fainter, followed in              his wake:      \"O leave me not behind!\"      Then grew he wild and desperate, clutching at that mirage,          the unattainable,      The lustrous cup that was to bring him happiness in its              possession.      And the voice blew ghostly in his wake, mingling with rain and          the whirl of dead leaves:      \"Leave me not behind!\"      But now the fire of unfulfilment seared his brain,      And often he staggered in the slough,      Or fell and cut himself on rocks.      And so, pushing on half-blindly,      Knew not at last from the dead rainbow the _ignis fatuus_,      The false witch-light that danced upon his path,      Leading him to destruction.  Until, lo!      With a flash and laugh it was not,      And he awoke to a mid-horror of darkness--      Night in the infernal swamps--      Blind, crawling, desolate; and for ever in his heart      The weeping shadow of a voice, \"O leave me not behind!\"      Then at that, like one amazed, he turned,      And cried in agony: \"Innocenza, my lost Innocence,      Where art thou?  O, little playmate, follow to my call!\"      And there answered him only from the gates of the sunset a        heart-broken sigh.'      He ended to a deep silence, and, while all stood stricken between tears  and expectancy, moved to within a pace of the Duke.    'O prince!' he cried, 'haunted of that Innocence! Turn back, turn back,  and find in thy lost playmate's face the ghost that now eludes thee!'    Carlo gave a little gasp, and his hand shivered down to his sword-hilt.  He must die for his Saint, if provoked to that martyrdom; but he would  take a desperate pledge or two of the sacrifice with him.  One of the  women, the younger, watching him, knew what was in his mind, and  breathed a little scornfully.  The other's eyes were set in a sort of  rapture upon the singer's face. A minute may have passed, holding them  all thus suspended, when suddenly Galeazzo rose, and, throwing himself  at Bembo's feet, broke into a passion of sobs and moans.    'Margherita, my little playmate, that liest under the daisies.  O, I  will be good, sweet--I will be good again for thy sake.'                                        *CHAPTER VI*      Many a head in the palace, though accustomed witness of strange things,  tossed on its pillow that night in sleepless review of a scene which had  been as amazing in its singularity as it was potential in its promise.  What were to be the first-fruits of that cataclysmic revulsion of  feeling in a nature so habitually frozen from all tenderness?  If no  more than a shy snowdrop or two of reason, mercy, justice, pushing their  way up through a savage soil, the result would be marvel enough.  Yet  there seemed somehow in the atmosphere an earnest of that and better.  The hearts of all trod on tiptoe, fearful of waking their souls to  disenchantment--agitated, exultant; wooing them to convalescence from an  ancient sickness.  The spring of a joyous hope was rising voiceless  somewhere in the thick of those drear corridors.  The f[oe]tid air,  wafted through a healing spray, came charged with an unwonted sweetness.  Whence had he risen, the lovely singing-boy, spirit of change, harbinger  of a new humanity?  Whither had he gone?  To the Duke's quarters--that  was all they knew. They had seen him carried off, persuaded, fondled,  revered by that very despot whom he had dared divinely to rebuke, and  the doors had clanged and the dream passed.  To what phase of its  development, confirming or disillusioning, would they reopen?  The  answer to them was at least a respite; and that was an answer sufficient  and satisfying to lives that obtained on a succession of respites.  Alas! as there is no logic in tyranny, so can there be none in those who  endure it.    The earliest ratification of the promise was to witness in the figure of  the Duke coming radiant from his rooms in company with the stranger  himself, his left arm fondly passed about the boy's neck, his eyes full  of admiration and flattery.  He felt no more discomfort, it appeared,  than had Madam Beatrice on a certain occasion, in the thought of his  late self-exposure before his creatures. Such shamelessness is the final  condition of autocracy. He had slept well, untormented of his vision.  As is the case with neurotics, a confident diagnosis of his disease had  proved the shortest means to its cure.  Clever the doctor, too, who  could make such a patient's treatment jump with his caprices; and with  an inspired intuition Bernardo had so manoeuvred to reconcile the two.  A whim much indulged may become a habit, and he was determined to  encourage to the top of its bent this whim of reformation in the Duke.  No ungrateful physicking of a soured bile for him; no uncomfortable  philosophy of organic atoms recombined.  He just restored to him that  long-lost toy of innocence, trusting that the imagination of the man  would find ever novel resources for play in that of which the invention  of the child had soon tired.  So for the present, and until virtue in  his patient should have become a second nature, was he resolved wisely  to eschew all reference to the intermediate state, and only by example  and analogy to win him to consciousness and repentance of the enormities  by which it had been stained.  A very profound little missionary, to be  sure.    The Duke, leaning on his arm as he strolled, had a smile and a word for  many.  The only visible token of his familiar self which he revealed was  the arbitrariness with which he exacted from all a fitting deference  towards his protege.  This, however, none, not the greatest, was  inclined to withhold, especially on such a morning.  Soft-footed  cardinals, princes of the blood, nobles and jingling captains, vied with  one another in obsequious attentions to our little neophyte of love.  The reasons, apart from superstitious reverence, were plentiful: his  sweetness, his beauty, his gifts of song--all warm recommendations to a  sensuous sociality; the whispered romance of his origin, no less a  patent in its eyes because it turned on a title doubly bastard; finally,  and most cogently, no doubt, his political potentialities as a favourite  _in posse_.    This last reason above any other may have accounted for the  extraordinary complaisance shown him by Messer Ludovico, the Duke's  third younger brother, at present at court, who was otherwise of a  rather inward and withdrawing nature.  He, this brother, had come from  Pavia, riding the final stage that morning, and though he had only  gathered by report the story of the last twelve hours,"]]]
