[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6112"],[0,"Nature and Human Nature (#11)"],[1," is a woman all over the world, whether she speaks Gaelic,  French, Indian, or Chinese; there are various entrances to her heart,  and if you have experience, you have got a compass which will enable  you to steer through one or the other of them, into the inner harbour  of it. Now, Minister used to say that Eve in Hebrew meant talk, for  providence gave her the power of chattyfication on purpose to take  charge of that department. Clack then you see is natural to them; talk  therefore to them as they like, and they will soon like to talk to  you. If a woman was to put a Bramah lock on her heart, a skilful man  would find his way into it if he wanted to, I know. That contrivance  is set to a particular word; find the letters that compose it, and it  opens at once. The moment I heard the Gaelic, I knew I had discovered  the cypher--I tried it and succeeded. Tell you what, Pilot, love and  skill laugh at locks, for them that can't be opened can be picked. The  mechanism of the human heart, when you thoroughly understand it, is,  like all the other works of nature, very beautiful, very wonderful,  but very simple. When it does not work well, the fault is not in the  machinery, but in the management.\"                                     CHAPTER IV.             A CRITTER WITH A THOUSAND VIRTUES AND BUT ONE VICE.      Soon after McDonald had returned and resumed his seat, a tall thin  man, dressed in a coarse suit of homespun, entered the room, and  addressing our host familiarly as Squire Peter, deposited in the  corner a fishing-rod, and proceeded to disencumber himself of a large  salmon basket apparently well filled, and also two wallets, one of  which seemed to contain his clothes, and the other, from the dull  heavy sound it emitted as he threw it on the floor, some tools. He was  about forty years of age. His head, which was singularly well formed,  was covered with a luxuriant mass of bushy black curls. His eyes were  large, deep set, and intelligent, his forehead expansive and  projecting, and his eyebrows heavy and shaggy. When addressing Peter  he raised them up in a peculiar manner, nearly to the centre of his  forehead, and when he ceased they suddenly dropped and partially  concealed his eyes.    It was impossible not to be attracted by a face that had two such  remarkable expressions; one of animation, amiability, and  intelligence; and the other of total abstraction. He bent forward,  even after he relieved himself of his load, and his attitude and gait  suggested the idea of an American land-surveyor, who had been  accustomed to carry heavy weights in the forest. Without condescending  to notice the party, further than bestowing on us a cursory glance to  ascertain whether he knew any of us, he drew up to the chimney corner,  and placing the soles of his boots perpendicularly to the fire (which  soon indicated by the vapour arising from them that he had been wading  in water), he asked in a listless manner and without waiting for  replies, some unconnected questions of the landlord: as, \"Any news,  Peter? how does the world use you? how are the young ladies? how is  fish this season? macarel plenty? any wrecks this year, Peter, eh? any  vessels sinking and dead men floating; silks, satins, ribbons, and  gold watches waiting to be picked up? Glorious coast this! the harvest  extends over the whole year.\" And then he drew his hand over his face  as if to suppress emotion, and immediately relapsed into silence and  stared moodily into the fire.    Peter seemed to understand that no answer was required, and therefore  made none, but asked him where he had come from?    \"Where did he come from?\" said the stranger, who evidently applied the  question to a fish in his basket, and not to himself, \"originally from  the lake, Peter, where it was spawned, and whither it annually  returns. You ought to understand that, Mac, for you have a head on  your shoulders, and that is more than half the poor wretches that  float ashore here from the deep have. It's a hard life, my friend,  going to sea, and hard shores sailors knock against sometimes, and  still harder hearts they often find there. A stone in the end of a  stocking is a sling for a giant, and soon puts an end to their  sufferings; a punishment for wearing gold watches, a penalty for  pride. Jolly tars eh? oh yes, very jolly! it's a jolly sight, ain't  it, to see two hundred half-naked, mangled, and disfigured bodies on  the beach, as I did the other day?\" and he gave a shudder at the  thought that seemed to shake the very chair he sat on. \"It's lucky  their friends don't see them, and know their sad fate. They were lost  at sea! that is enough for mothers and wives to hear. The cry for  help, when there is none to save, the shriek of despair, when no hope  is left, the half-uttered prayer, the last groan, and the last  struggle of death, are all hushed in the storm, and weeping friends  know not what they lament.\"    After a short pause, he continued:    \"That sight has most crazed me. What was it you asked? Oh, I have it!  you asked where he came from? From the lake, Peter, where he was  spawned, and where he returned you see, to die. You were spawned on  the shores of one of the bays of the Highlands of Scotland. Wouldn't  you like to return and lay your bones there, eh? From earth you came,  to earth you shall return. Wouldn't you like to go back and breathe  the air of childhood once more before you die? Love of home, Peter, is  strong; it is an instinct of nature; but, alas! the world is a  Scotchman's home--anywhere that he can make money. Don't the mountains  with their misty summits appear before you sometimes in your sleep?  Don't you dream of their dark shadows and sunny spots, their heathy  slopes and deep deep glens? Do you see the deer grazing there, and  hear the bees hum merrily as they return laden with honey, or the  grouse rise startled, and whirr away to hide itself in its distant  covert? Do the dead ever rise from their graves and inhabit again the  little cottage that looks out on the stormy sea? Do you become a child  once more, and hear your mother's voice, as she sings the little  simple air that lulls you to sleep, or watch with aching eyes for the  returning boat that brings your father, with the shadows of evening,  to his humble home? And what is the language of your dreams? not  English, French, or Indian, Peter, for they have been learned for  trade or for travel, but Gaelic, for that was the language of love.  Had you left home early, Mac, and forgotten its words or its sounds,  had all trace of it vanished from your memory as if it had never been,  still would you have heard it, and known it, and talked it in your  dreams. Peter, it is the voice of nature, and that is the voice of  God!\"    \"She'll tell her what she treams of sometimes,\" said McDonald, \"she  treams of ta mountain dew--ta clear water of life.\"    \"I will be bound you do,\" said the doctor, \"and I do if you don't, so,  Peter, my boy, give me a glass; it will cheer my heart, for I have  been too much alone lately, and have seen such horrid sights, I feel  dull.\"    While Peter (who was a good deal affected with this reference to his  native land) was proceeding to comply with his request, he relapsed  into his former state of abstraction, and when the liquor was  presented to him, appeared altogether to have forgotten that he had  asked for it.    \"Come, Toctor,\" said the host, touching him on the shoulder, \"come,  take a drop of this, it will cheer you up; you seem a peg too low  to-day. It's the genuine thing, it is some the Governor, Sir Colin  Campbell, gave me.\"    \"None the better for that, Peter, none the better for that, for the  rich give out of their abundance, the poor from their last cup and  their last loaf; one is the gift of station, the other the gift of the  heart.\"    \"Indeed then, she is mistakened, man. It was the gift of as  true-hearted a Highlander as ever lived. I went to see him lately,  about a grant of land. He was engaged writing at the time, and an  officher was standing by him for orders, and sais he to me, 'My good  friend, could you call to-morrow? for I am very busy to-day, as you  see.' Well, I answered him in Gaelic that the wind was fair, and I was  anxious to go home, but if he would be at leisure next week I would  return again. Oh, I wish you had seen him, Doctor, when he heard his  native tongue. He threw down his pen, jumped up like a boy, and took  me by the hand, and shook it with all his might. 'Oh,' said he, 'I  haven't heard that for years; the sound of it does my heart good. You  must come again and see me after the steamer has left for England.  What can I do for you? So I told him in a few words I wanted a grant  of two hundred acres of land adjoining this place. And he took a  minute of my name, and of Skip Harbour, and the number of my lot, and  wrote underneath an order for the grant. 'Take that to the  Surveyor-General,' said he, 'and the next time you come to Halifax the  grant will be ready for you.' Then he rang the bell, and when the  servant came, he ordered him to fill a hamper of whiskey and take it  down to my vessel.'    \"Did you get the grant?\" said the stranger.    \"Indeed she did,\" said Peter, \"and when she came to read it, it was  for five instead of two hundred acres.\"    \"Good!\" said the other. \"Come, I like that. Fill me another glass and  I will drink his health.\"    \"Well done, old boy!\" said I to myself, \"you know how to carry your  sentimentality to market anyhow. Doctor, doctor! So you are a doctor,\"  sais I to myself, \"are you? Well, there is something else in you than  dough pills, and salts, and senna, at any rate, and that is more than  most of your craft have, at all events. I'll draw you out presently,  for I never saw a man with that vein of melancholy in him, that didn't  like fun, providin' his sadness warn't the effect of disease. So  here's at you; I'll make the fun start"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6124"],[0,"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (#11)"],[1,"crossness affects me so. If ever he had any kindness towards me, I  believe he now hates me heartily.    Is it not strange, that love borders so much upon hate? But this wicked  love is not like the true virtuous love, to be sure: that and hatred  must be as far off, as light and darkness. And how must this hate have  been increased, if he had met with such a base compliance, after his  wicked will had been gratified.    Well, one may see by a little, what a great deal means. For if innocence  cannot attract common civility, what must guilt expect, when novelty  has ceased to have its charms, and changeableness had taken place of it?  Thus we read in Holy Writ, that wicked Amnon, when he had ruined poor  Tamar, hated her more than he ever loved her, and would have turned her  out of door.    How happy am I, to be turned out of door, with that sweet companion my  innocence!--O may that be always my companion! And while I presume not  upon my own strength, and am willing to avoid the tempter, I hope the  divine grace will assist me.    Forgive me, that I repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer. I owe  every thing, next to God's goodness, to your piety and good examples, my  dear parents, my dear poor parents! I say that word with pleasure; for  your poverty is my pride, as your integrity shall be my imitation.    As soon as I have dined, I will put on my new clothes. I long to have  them on. I know I shall surprise Mrs. Jervis with them; for she shan't  see me till I am full dressed.--John is come back, and I'll soon send  you some of what I have written.--I find he is going early in the  morning; and so I'll close here, that I am                                       Your most dutiful DAUGHTER.    Don't lose your time in meeting me; because I am so uncertain. It is  hard if, some how or other, I can't get a passage to you. But may be  my master won't refuse to let John bring me. I can ride behind him, I  believe, well enough; for he is very careful, and very honest; and you  know John as well as I; for he loves you both. Besides, may be, Mrs.  Jervis can put me in some way.          LETTER XXIV      DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,    I shall write on, as long as I stay, though I should have nothing but  silliness to write; for I know you divert yourselves on nights with  what I write, because it is mine. John tells me how much you long for  my coming; but he says, he told you he hoped something would happen to  hinder it.    I am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away; for if  my fellow-servants should guess, it were better so, than to have it from  you or me. Besides, I really am concerned, that my master should  cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me; for, besides the  disgrace, it has quite turned his temper; and I begin to believe what  Mrs. Jervis told me, that he likes me, and can't help it; and yet  strives to conquer it; and so finds no way but to be cross to me.    Don't think me presumptuous and conceited; for it is more my concern  than my pride, to see such a gentleman so demean himself, and lessen  the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants, on my  account.--But I am to tell you of my new dress to day.    And so, when I had dined, up stairs I went, and locked myself into my  little room. There I tricked myself up as well as I could in my new  garb, and put on my round-eared ordinary cap; but with a green knot,  however, and my homespun gown and petticoat, and plain leather shoes;  but yet they are what they call Spanish leather; and my ordinary hose,  ordinary I mean to what I have been lately used to; though I shall think  good yarn may do very well for every day, when I come home. A plain  muslin tucker I put on, and my black silk necklace, instead of the  French necklace my lady gave me; and put the ear-rings out of my ears;  and when I was quite equipped, I took my straw hat in my hand, with  its two blue strings, and looked about me in the glass, as proud as any  thing--To say truth, I never liked myself so well in my life.    O the pleasure of descending with ease, innocence, and  resignation!--Indeed, there is nothing like it! An humble mind, I  plainly see, cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment, let  fortune's wheel turn round as it will.    So I went down to look for Mrs. Jervis, to see how she liked me.    I met, as I was upon the stairs, our Rachel, who is the house-maid; and  she made me a low courtesy, and I found did not know me. So I smiled,  and went to the housekeeper's parlour; and there sat good Mrs. Jervis at  work, making a shift: and, would you believe it? she did not know me at  first; but rose up, and pulled off her spectacles; and said, Do you want  me, forsooth? I could not help laughing, and said, Hey-day! Mrs. Jervis,  what! don't you know me?--She stood all in amaze, and looked at me  from top to toe: Why, you surprise me, said she: What! Pamela thus  metamorphosed! How came this about?    As it happened, in stept my master; and my back being to him, he thought  it was a stranger speaking to Mrs. Jervis, and withdrew again: and did  not hear her ask, If his honour had any commands for her?--She turned me  about and about, and I shewed her all my dress, to my under-petticoat:  and she said, sitting down, Why, I am all in amaze, I must sit down.  What can all this mean? I told her, I had no clothes suitable to my  condition when I returned to my father's; and so it was better to begin  here, as I was soon to go away, that all my fellow-servants might see I  knew how to suit myself to the state I was returning to.    Well, said she, I never knew the like of thee. But this sad preparation  for going away (for now I see you are quite in earnest) is what I know  not how to get over. O my dear Pamela, how can I part with you!    My master rung in the back-parlour, and so I withdrew, and Mrs. Jervis  went to attend him. It seems, he said to her, I was coming in to let  you know, that I shall go to Lincolnshire, and possibly to my sister  Davers's, and be absent some weeks. But, pray, what pretty neat damsel  was with you? She says, she smiled, and asked, If his honour did not  know who it was? No, said he, I never saw her before. Farmer Nichols,  or Farmer Brady, have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a  daughter! have they?--Though I did not see her face neither, said he.  If your honour won't be angry, said she, I will introduce her into your  presence; for I think, says she, she outdoes our Pamela.    Now I did not thank her for this, as I told her afterwards, (for it  brought a great deal of trouble upon me, as well as crossness, as you  shall hear). That can't be, he was pleased to say. But if you can find  an excuse for it, let her come in.    At that she stept to me, and told me, I must go in with her to her  master; but, said she, for goodness' sake, let him find you out; for he  don't know you. O fie, Mrs. Jervis, said I, how could you serve me so?  Besides, it looks too free both in me, and to him. I tell you, said she,  you shall come in; and pray don't reveal yourself till he finds you out.    So I went in, foolish as I was; though I must have been seen by him  another time, if I had not then. And she would make me take my straw hat  in my hand.    I dropt a low courtesy, but said never a word. I dare say he knew me as  soon as he saw my face: but was as cunning as Lucifer. He came up to me,  and took me by the hand, and said, Whose pretty maiden are you?--I dare  say you are Pamela's sister, you are so like her. So neat, so clean, so  pretty! Why, child, you far surpass your sister Pamela!    I was all confusion, and would have spoken: but he took me about the  neck: Why, said he, you are very pretty, child: I would not be so free  with your sister, you may believe; but I must kiss you.    O sir, said I, I am Pamela, indeed I am: indeed I am Pamela, her own  self!    He kissed me for all I could do; and said, Impossible! you are a  lovelier girl by half than Pamela; and sure I may be innocently free  with you, though I would not do her so much favour.    This was a sad trick upon me, indeed, and what I could not expect; and  Mrs. Jervis looked like a fool as much as I, for her officiousness.--At  last I got away, and ran out of the parlour, most sadly vexed, as you  may well think.    He talked a good deal to Mrs. Jervis, and at last ordered me to come  in to him. Come in, said he, you little villain!--for so he called me.  (Good sirs! what a name was there!)--who is it you put your tricks upon?  I was resolved never to honour your unworthiness, said he, with so much  notice again; and so you must disguise yourself to attract me, and yet  pretend, like an hypocrite as you are----    I was out of patience then: Hold, good sir, said I; don't impute  disguise and hypocrisy to me, above all things; for I hate them both,  mean as I am. I have put on no disguise.--What a plague, said he, for  that was his word, do you mean then by this dress?--Why, and please your  honour, said I, I mean one of the honestest things in the world.    I have been in disguise, indeed, ever since my good lady your mother  took me from my poor parents. I came to her ladyship so poor and mean,  that these clothes I have on, are a princely suit to those I had then:  and her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes, and other bounties: and as  I am now returning to my poor parents again so soon, I cannot wear those  good things without being hooted at; and so have bought what will be  more suitable to my degree, and be a good holiday-suit too, when I get  home.    He then took me in his arms, and presently pushed me from him. Mrs.  Jervis, said he, take the little witch from me; I can neither bear,  nor forbear her--(Strange words these!)--But stay; you shan't go!--Yet  begone!--No, come back again.    I thought he was mad, for my share; for he knew not what he would have.  I was going, however; but he stept after me, and took hold"]]]
