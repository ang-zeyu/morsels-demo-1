I was desirous of finding out whether the whole  household could sing, so I ordered a drink; a boy near at hand instantly  repeated my order in a singsong voice fully as shrill, and whichever one  you accosted did the same.  You would not imagine that this was the  dining-room of a private gentleman, but rather that it was an exhibition  of pantomimes.  A very inviting relish was brought on, for by now all the  couches were occupied save only that of Trimalchio, for whom, after a new  custom, the chief place was reserved.    On the tray stood a donkey made of Corinthian bronze, bearing panniers  containing olives, white in one and black in the other.  Two platters  flanked the figure, on the margins of which were engraved Trimalchio's  name and the weight of the silver in each.  Dormice sprinkled with  poppy-seed and honey were served on little bridges soldered fast to the  platter, and hot sausages on a silver gridiron, underneath which were  damson plums and pomegranate seeds.          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND.    We were in the midst of these delicacies when, to the sound of music,  Trimalchio himself was carried in and bolstered up in a nest of small  cushions, which forced a snicker from the less wary.  A shaven poll  protruded from a scarlet mantle, and around his neck, already muffled  with heavy clothing, he had tucked a napkin having a broad purple stripe  and a fringe that hung down all around.  On the little finger of his left  hand he wore a massive gilt ring, and on the first joint of the next  finger, a smaller one which seemed to me to be of pure gold, but as a  matter of fact it had iron stars soldered on all around it.  And then,  for fear all of his finery would not be displayed, he bared his right  arm, adorned with a golden arm-band and an ivory circlet clasped with a  plate of shining metal.          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD.    Picking his teeth with a silver quill, \"Friends,\" said he, \"it was not  convenient for me to come into the dining-room just yet, but for fear my  absence should cause you any inconvenience, I gave over my own pleasure:  permit me, however, to finish my game.\"  A slave followed with a  terebinth table and crystal dice, and I noted one piece of luxury that  was superlative; for instead of black and white pieces, he used gold and  silver coins.  He kept up a continual flow of various coarse expressions.  We were still dallying with the relishes when a tray was brought in, on  which was a basket containing a wooden hen with her wings rounded and  spread out as if she were brooding.  Two slaves instantly approached, and  to the accompaniment of music, commenced to feel around in the straw.  They pulled out some pea-hen's eggs, which they distributed among the  diners.  Turning his head, Trimalchio saw what was going on.  \"Friends,\"  he remarked.  \"I ordered pea-hen's eggs set under the hen, but I'm afraid  they're addled, by Hercules I am let's try them anyhow, and see if  they're still fit to suck.\"  We picked up our spoons, each of which  weighed not less than half a pound, and punctured the shells, which were  made of flour and dough, and as a matter of fact, I very nearly threw  mine away for it seemed to me that a chick had formed already, but upon  hearing an old experienced guest vow, \"There must be something good  here,\" I broke open the shell with my hand and discovered a fine fat  fig-pecker, imbedded in a yolk seasoned with pepper.          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH.    Having finished his game, Trimalchio was served with a helping of  everything and was announcing in a loud voice his willingness to join  anyone in a second cup of honied wine, when, to a flourish of music, the  relishes were suddenly whisked away by a singing chorus, but a small dish  happened to fall to the floor, in the scurry, and a slave picked it up.  Seeing this, Trimalchio ordered that the boy be punished by a box on the  ear, and made him throw it down again; a janitor followed with his broom  and swept the silver dish away among the litter.  Next followed two  long-haired Ethiopians, carrying small leather bottles, such as are  commonly seen in the hands of those who sprinkle sand in the arena, and  poured wine upon our hands, for no one offered us water.  When  complimented upon these elegant extras, the host cried out, \"Mars loves  a fair fight: and so I ordered each one a separate table: that way these  stinking slaves won't make us so hot with their crowding.\"  Some glass  bottles carefully sealed with gypsum were brought in at that instant; a  label bearing this inscription was fastened to the neck of each one:                               OPIMIAN FALERNIAN                           ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD.    While we were studying the labels, Trimalchio clapped his hands and  cried, \"Ah me!  To think that wine lives longer than poor little man.  Let's fill 'em up!  There's life in wine and this is the real Opimian,  you can take my word for that.  I offered no such vintage yesterday,  though my guests were far more respectable.\"  We were tippling away and  extolling all these elegant devices, when a slave brought in a silver  skeleton, so contrived that the joints and movable vertebra could be  turned in any direction.  He threw it down upon the table a time or two,  and its mobile articulation caused it to assume grotesque attitudes,  whereupon Trimalchio chimed in:                  \"Poor man is nothing in the scheme of things                 And Orcus grips us and to Hades flings                 Our bones!  This skeleton before us here                 Is as important as we ever were!                 Let's live then while we may and life is dear.\"          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH.    The applause was followed by a course which, by its oddity, drew every  eye, but it did not come up to our expectations.  There was a circular  tray around which were displayed the signs of the zodiac, and upon each  sign the caterer had placed the food best in keeping with it.  Ram's  vetches on Aries, a piece of beef on Taurus, kidneys and lamb's fry on  Gemini, a crown on Cancer, the womb of an unfarrowed sow on Virgo, an  African fig on Leo, on Libra a balance, one pan of which held a tart and  the other a cake, a small seafish on Scorpio, a bull's eye on  Sagittarius, a sea lobster on Capricornus, a goose on Aquarius and two  mullets on Pisces.  In the middle lay a piece of cut sod upon which  rested a honeycomb with the grass arranged around it.  An Egyptian slave  passed bread around from a silver oven and in a most discordant voice  twisted out a song in the manner of the mime in the musical farce called  Laserpitium.  Seeing that we were rather depressed at the prospect of  busying ourselves with such vile fare, Trimalchio urged us to fall to:  \"Let us fall to, gentlemen, I beg of you, this is only the sauce!\"          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH.    While he was speaking, four dancers ran in to the time of the music,  and removed the upper part of the tray.  Beneath, on what seemed to be  another tray, we caught sight of stuffed capons and sows' bellies, and in  the middle, a hare equipped with wings to resemble Pegasus.  At the  corners of the tray we also noted four figures of Marsyas and from their  bladders spouted a highly spiced sauce upon fish which were swimming  about as if in a tide-race.  All of us echoed the applause which was  started by the servants, and fell to upon these exquisite delicacies,  with a laugh.  \"Carver,\" cried Trimalchio, no less delighted with the  artifice practised upon us, and the carver appeared immediately.  Timing  his strokes to the beat of the music he cut up the meat in such a fashion  as to lead you to think that a gladiator was fighting from a chariot to  the accompaniment of a water-organ.  Every now and then Trimalchio would  repeat \"Carver, Carver,\" in a low voice, until I finally came to the  conclusion that some joke was meant in repeating a word so frequently, so  I did not scruple to question him who reclined above me.  As he had often  experienced byplay of this sort he explained, \"You see that fellow who is  carving the meat, don't you?  Well, his name is Carver.  Whenever  Trimalchio says Carver, carve her, by the same word, he both calls and  commands!\"          CHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH.    I could eat no more, so I turned to my whilom informant to learn as much  as I could and sought to draw him out with far-fetched gossip.  I  inquired who that woman could be who was scurrying about hither and yon  in such a fashion.  \"She's called Fortunata,\" he replied.  \"She's the  wife of Trimalchio, and she measures her money by the peck.  And only a  little while ago, what was she!  May your genius pardon me, but you would  not have been willing to take a crust of bread from her hand.  Now,  without rhyme or reason, she's in the seventh heaven and is Trimalchio's  factotum, so much so that he would believe her if she told him it was  dark when it was broad daylight!  As for him, he don't know how rich he  is, but this harlot keeps an eye on everything and where you least expect  to find her, you're sure to run into her.  She's temperate, sober, full  of good advice, and has many good qualities, but she has a scolding  tongue, a very magpie on a sofa, those she likes, she likes, but those  she dislikes, she dislikes!  Trimalchio himself has estates as broad as  the flight of a kite is long, and piles of money.  There's more silver  plate lying in his steward's office than other men have in their whole  fortunes!  And as for slaves, damn me if I believe a tenth of them knows  the master by sight.  The truth is, that these stand-a-gapes are so much  in awe of him that any one of them would step into a fresh dunghill  without ever knowing it, at a mere nod from him!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],[0,"The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#11)"],[1,"ceremony offers a good         opportunity for the guests who desire to         present flowers to the mother. This is not         obligatory, however, and must remain a         matter of personal taste.      GIFTS. A christening ceremony offers a good         opportunity for the invited guests, if they         desire, to send a present to the baby.           These should be sent a day or two before         the ceremony, and if of silver should be         marked with the child's name, initials, or         monogram.      GUESTS. The invitations should be promptly         answered.           At a church ceremony the guests, as they         are few in number, assemble in the front         pews.           At a large house christening the affair is         conducted somewhat like an afternoon reception.         Wine is drunk to the child's health,         and the guests take leave of the hostess.      INVITATIONS are issued by the wife only to intimate         friends, and should be promptly answered.           If the christening is made a formal entertainment,         to take place in the drawing-room,         the invitations may be engraved.      MEN. If the ceremony is in the afternoon they         wear afternoon dress, but at an evening         affair evening dress.           At an afternoon ceremony in the summer         it is allowable for the men to wear straw         hats and light flannel suits.           At a large house christening the affair         should be conducted somewhat like a reception,         and men on departing should take leave         of the hostess.      WOMEN dress as they would for an afternoon reception         if the ceremony comes in the afternoon, and if it comes         after breakfast or luncheon, as they would for a breakfast         or luncheon.           At a large house christening the affair         should be conducted like a reception, and         women should take leave of the hostess on         their departure.      CHURCH. A man usually follows the woman, who         leads to the pew, and he enters after her,         closing the door as he does so.           He should find the places in the service         book for her.           This same courtesy he should extend to a         woman who is a stranger to him.        CLERGYMAN.      CHRISTENING FEES. It is customary to send a         fee to the officiating clergyman, unless he is         a relative or a near friend.      EVENING DRESS. Custom permits a clergyman         to wear his clerical dress at all functions at         which other men wear evening dress; or,         if he wishes, he may also wear the regulation         full dress. The wearing of either is a matter         of taste.      HOW ADDRESSED. All mail and correspondence         should be addressed to Rev. Mr. Smith, but         in conversation a clergyman should be addressed         as Mr. Smith. If he has received the degree of D.D.         (Doctor of Divinity)from some educational institution,         then he is addressed as Dr. Smith, and his mail should         be addressed as Rev. Dr. Smith.      WEDDING CEREMONY. The officiating clergyman (minister or priest)         is selected by the bride, who usually chooses         her family minister, and the latter is then called         upon by the groom with regard to the details. If a         very intimate friend or relative of the groom is a         clergyman, it is in good taste for the bride to ask         him either to officiate or to assist.           If from any cause--as, living outside the State--the         clergyman is unable to legally perform the ceremony,         a magistrate should be present to legalize the ceremony,         and should receive a fee.      CARRIAGE. A carriage should be provided by         the groom to take the clergyman to the         church, then to the reception, and thence to         his house.      FEE. A fee should be paid the clergyman by         the groom through the best man, who should         hand it to him immediately after the ceremony.         If two or three clergymen are present         and assist, the fee of the officiating clergyman         is double that of the others. The clergyman         should receive at least five dollars in gold,         clean bills, or check, in a sealed envelope,         or more, in proportion to the groom's financial         condition and social position.      WEDDING RECEPTION. The clergyman should         always be invited to the reception.        CLUB.      ADDRESS. If residing at a club, a man's visiting-         card should have his club's name in the lower         right-hand corner; if not, the name should         be put in lower left-hand corner.      STATIONERY. This is always in good form for         social correspondence by men.        COACHING. See DRIVING.        COACHMAN-TIPS. It is customary when a guest         leaves a house party after a visit to give the         coachman a tip.        COLLEGE DEGREES. Custom, good taste, and the fitness         of things forbid a college man having engraved,         on his visiting-card, his college degrees--as,         A.B., A.M., etc.        COMMERCE, Secretary of--How Addressed. An official         letter begins: Sir, and ends: I have, sir,         the honor to remain your most obedient servant.           A social letter begins: My dear Mr. Wilson,         and ends: I have the honor to remain most sincerely         yours.         The address on the envelope is: Hon. John         J. Wilson, Secretary of Commerce.        COMMITTEES-PUBLIC BALLS. Public balls are conducted         like private ones, and the etiquette is the         same for the guests. The difference in their         management is that, in place of a hostess, her         functions and duties are filled by committees         selected by the organization giving the ball.        CONCLUSION OF A LETTER. The standard conclusions of         letters are: I remain sincerely yours, or; Believe         me faithfully yours.           For business correspondence the standard         conclusions are: Yours truly, or; Very truly yours.           For relatives and dear friends the standard         forms are: Affectionately yours, or; Devotedly yours.           One should avoid signing a letter with only initials,         Christian name, surnames, or diminutives.        MEN. In writing formally on business to a         woman he knows slightly, a man could say:         I am respectfully yours. When not on business         he could write: I beg to remain yours to command.           He should avoid a signature like: J. Jones         Wilson, but write: James J. Wilson      WOMEN. In social correspondence a married woman should         sign: Minnie Wilson, and not: Mrs. John Wilson.         If she wants to make known in a business letter         the fact of her being married, and may not know         if the person addressed knows the fact, she may write:             Minnie Wilson             (Mrs. John Wilson)         An unmarried woman would sign her name as:         Minnie Wilson, and if wishing not to be taken         for a widow would sign: Miss Minnie Wilson.        CONDOLENCE.      CALLS. When death occurs in the family of a friend,         one should call in person and make kindly         inquiries for the family and leave a card,         but should not ask to see those in trouble         unless a very near and dear acquaintanceship warrants.           For a very intimate acquaintance, cut flowers         may be left in person or sent, together         with a card, unless the request has been made         to send none.      CARDS. A visiting-card is used with the word         CONDOLENCE written on it, and should be left         in person if possible, but may be sent or         mailed to intimate friends only if accompanied         by a note of apology. If out of town, it         should be sent by mail with letter of condolence.           A MR. and MRS. card may be used at any         time for condolence, except for intimate         friends.      LETTERS. Only the most intimate and dear         friends should send letters of condolence, and         they may send flowers with the note unless         the request has been made to send none.        CONGRATULATIONS.      BIRTH, ANNOUNCEMENT OF. If wishing to         send congratulations after a birth, cards         should be left in person or sent by messenger.         Cut flowers may be sent with the card.      CARDS. A MR. and MRS. card can be used at any         time for congratulations. If left in person,         which is preferable, the card should be accompanied         by a kindly message, and, if sent         by mail or messenger' the word CONGRATULATIONS         should be written on it. Business and professional         men are not required to make personal calls, and         so may send their cards. A Mr. and Mrs. card can         be used for all but near friends.           When a card is left in person, with a message         of congratulations, nothing should be         written thereon.           A man may mail his card to a woman engaged         to be married, if acquaintance warrants         the action.           Congratulations upon the birth of a child         may be expressed by a man to its father by         sending a card with the word Congratulations         written on it, or by leaving it in         person.           A card should be mailed to a man engaged         to be married.      WEDDINGS. Congratulations may be sent with           letter of acceptance or declination to a wedding           to those sending the invitations. And           if acquaintance with bride and groom warrant,           a note of congratulations may be sent to           them also.             Guests in personal conversation with the           latter give best wishes to the bride and           congratulations to the groom.      WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES. In accepting or"]]]
