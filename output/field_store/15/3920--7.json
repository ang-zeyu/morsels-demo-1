It has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands,  to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than  one; and I have yet to find the place and meet the people, where  and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious  than among the maligned \"Mormons\" in the mountain valleys of the  west.  There I find this measure of just equality of the sexes--  _that the sins of man shall not be visited upon the head of  woman_.    At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter-day Saints,  there was no law, national or state, against its practise.  This  statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between bigamy and  the \"Mormon\" institution of plural marriage.  In 1862, a law was  enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage, and, as  had been predicted in the national Senate prior to its passage,  it lay for many years a dead letter.  Federal judges and United  States attorneys in Utah, who were not \"Mormons\" nor lovers of  \"Mormonism,\" refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases  under the law, because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy.  But other laws followed, most of which, as the Latter-day Saints  believe, were aimed directly at their religious conception of the  marriage contract, and not at social impropriety nor sexual  offense.    At last the Edmunds-Tucker act took effect, making not the  marriage alone but the subsequent acknowledging of the contract  an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.  Under the  spell of unrighteous zeal, the federal judiciary of Utah  announced and practised that most infamous doctrine of  segregation of offenses with accumulating penalties.    I who write have listened to judges instructing grand juries in  such terms as these: that although the law of Congress designated  as an offense the acknowledging of more living wives than one by  any man, and prescribed a penalty therefor, as Congress had not  specified the length of time during which this unlawful  acknowledging must continue to constitute the offense, grand  juries might indict separately for every day of the period during  which the forbidden relationship existed.  This meant that for an  alleged misdemeanor--for which Congress prescribed a maximum  penalty of six months' imprisonment and a fine of three hundred  dollars--a man might be imprisoned for life, aye, for many terms  of a man's natural life did the court's power to enforce its  sentences extend so far, and might be fined millions of dollars.  Before this travesty on the administration of law could be  brought before the court of last resort, and there meet with the  reversal and rebuke it deserved, men were imprisoned under  sentences of many years' duration.    The people contested these measures one by one in the courts;  presenting in case after case the different phases of the  subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.  Then  the Church was disincorporated, and its property both real and  personal confiscated and escheated to the government of the  United States; and although the personal property was soon  restored, real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the  court's receiver, and the \"Mormon\" Church had to pay the national  government high rental on its own property.  But the people have  suspended the practise of plural marriage; and the testimony of  the governors, judges, and district attorneys of the territory,  and later that of the officers of the state, have declared the  sincerity of the renunciation.    As the people had adopted the practise under what was believed to  be divine approval, they suspended it when they were justified in  so doing.  In whatever light this practise has been regarded in  the past, it is today a dead issue, forbidden by ecclesiastical  rule as it is prohibited by legal statute.  And the world is  learning, to its manifest surprise, that plural marriage and  \"Mormonism\" are not synonymous terms.                              -----------    And so the story of \"Mormonism\" runs on; its finale has not yet  been written; the current press presents continuously new stages  of its progress, new developments of its plan.  Today the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is stronger than ever  before; and the people are confident that it is at its weakest  stage for all time to come.  It lives and thrives because within  it are the elements of thrift and the forces of life.  It  embraces a boundless liberality of belief and practise; true  toleration is one of its essential features; it makes love for  mankind second only to love for Deity.  Its creed provides for  the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to  the dictates of conscience.  It contemplates a millennium of  peace, when every man shall love his neighbor and respect his  neighbor's opinion as he regards himself and his own--a day when  the voice of the people shall be in unison with the voice of God.        THE PHILOSOPHY OF \"MORMONISM\"        CHAPTER I    In this attempt to treat the philosophy of \"Mormonism\" it is  assumed that no discussion of Christianity in general nor of the  philosophy of Christianity is required.  The \"Mormon\" creed, so  far as there is a creed professed by the Latter-day Saints, is  pre-eminently Christian in theory, precept, and practise.  In  what respect, then, may be properly asked, does \"Mormonism\"  differ from the faith and practise of other professedly Christian  systems--in short, what is \"Mormonism?\"    First, let it be remembered that the term \"Mormon,\" with its  derivatives, is not the official designation of the Church with  which it is usually associated.  The name was originally applied  in a spirit of derision, as a nick-name in fact, by the opponents  of the Church; and was doubtless suggested by the title of a  prominent publication given to the world through Joseph Smith in  an early period of the Church's history.  This, of course, is the  Book of Mormon.  Nevertheless, the people have accepted the name  thus thrust upon them, and answer readily to its call.  The  proper title of the organization is \"The Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.\"  The philosophy of \"Mormonism\" is declared  in the name.  The people claim this name as having been bestowed  by revelation and therefore that, like other names given of God  as attested by scriptural instances, it is at once name and title  combined.    The Church declines to sail under any flag of man-made design; it  repudiates the name of mortals as a part of its title, and thus  differs from Lutherans and Wesleyans, Calvinists, Mennonites, and  many others, all of whom, worthy though their organizations may  be, elevating as may be their precepts, good as may be their  practises, declare themselves the followers of men.  This is not  the church of Moses nor the prophets, of Paul nor of Cephas, of  Apollos nor of John; neither of Joseph Smith nor of Brigham  Young.  It asserts its proud claim as the Church of Jesus Christ.    It refuses to wear a name indicative of distinctive or peculiar  doctrines; and in this particular, it differs from churches  Catholic and Protestant, Presbyterian, Congregationalist,  Unitarian, Methodist and Baptist; its sole distinguishing  features are those of the Church of Christ.    In an effort to present in concise form the cardinal doctrines of  this organization, I cannot do better than quote the so-called  _Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints_, which have been in published form before the world for  over half a century.[4]    [Footnote 4: For extended treatment of \"Mormon\" doctrine see \"The  Articles of Faith: a Series of Lectures on the Principal  Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" by  James E.

We believe that men will be punished for their own      sins, and not for Adam's transgression.        3. We believe that, through the atonement of Christ, all      mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and      ordinances of the gospel.        4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances      of the gospel are: First, Faith in the Lord Jesus      Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion      for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands      for the gift of the Holy Ghost.        5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by      prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who      are in authority, to preach the gospel and administer in      the ordinances thereof.        6. We believe in the same organization that existed in      the primitive church, namely, apostles, prophets,      pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.        7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy,      revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues,      etc.        8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as      it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of      Mormon to be the word of God.        9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he      does now reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal      many great and important things pertaining to the      Kingdom of God.        10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in      the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be      built upon this [the American] continent; that Christ      will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth      will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.        11.

Mamsie, do come!\" she cried to Mrs. Pepper on the path.    \"Hum! I think, Jasper, you and I will let them alone for a few  moments,\" said Mr. King, who was still within the stage. \"Here, my good  fellow,\" to Mr. Tisbett, \"you say it's all comfortable in there for  them?\"    \"Yes, yes, sir,\" said Mr. Tisbett heartily. \"Good land! Mis' Henderson  had her boys come down airly this mornin' and make the fires; and  there's a mighty sight of things to eat.\" The stage-driver put one foot  on the hind wheel to facilitate conversation, and smacked his lips.    \"All very well. Now you may drive us down the road a bit,\" said Mr.  King, withdrawing his head to the depths of the lumbering old vehicle  again.    \"Ain't goin' in?\" cried Mr. Tisbett, opening his round eyes at him in  astonishment.    \"Get up and drive us on, I say,\" commanded the old gentleman, \"and  cease your talking,\" which had the effect to send honest Mr. Tisbett  clambering expeditiously up to the box, where he presently revenged  himself by driving furiously over all the hard frozen ruts he could  quickly select, determined not to stop till he was obliged to.    \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Mr. King within, holding to the strap at the  side, as well as to the leather band of the swinging seat in front.  \"What an abominable road!\"    \"The road is well enough,\" said Jasper, who couldn't bear to have a  word uttered against Badgertown, \"it's the fellow's driving that makes  it rough. Here, can't you be a little more careful to keep the road?\"  he called, thrusting his head out of the window. But he only narrowly  escaped losing his brown traveling cap for his pains, as the stage gave  a worse lurch than before, to introduce a series of creakings and  joltings hitherto unparalleled.    \"I cannot endure this much longer,\" said old Mr. King, growing white  around the mouth, and wishing he had strength for one-half the  exclamations he felt inwardly capable of. Outside, honest Mr. Tisbett  was taking solid comfort in the reflection that he was teaching a rich  city man that he could not approach with anything less than respect a  citizen of Badgertown.    \"Ain't I as good as he?\" cried Mr. Tisbett to himself, with an extra  cut to the off horse, as he spied a sharp ragged edge of ice along the  cart track in front of him. \"Now that's good; that'll shake him,\" he  added cheerfully. \"Land! but I hain't been spoke to so since I was  sassed at school by Jim Bently, and then I licked him enough to pay  twice over. G'lang there--easy!\"    The first thing he knew, one of the glass windows was shivered to  fragments; the bits flying off along the quiet road, to fall a gleaming  shower upon the snow.    \"Whoa!\" called Mr. Tisbett, to his smoking horses, and leaning over, he  cried, \"What's the matter in there?\"    \"The matter is,\" said Jasper, putting his face out, \"that as I could  not possibly make you hear my calls, I chose to break the window. Have  the goodness to let my father and me at once out of this vehicle.\"    Mr. Tisbett got down slowly over the wheel. \"Beg your pardon,\" he said  awkwardly, pulling open the door, \"ain't you goin' to ride back?\"    \"Heavens!\" cried Mr. King. He was glad to find he could ejaculate so  much as he tremblingly worked his way out to terra firma. \"Nothing on  earth would tempt me to step foot inside there again.\"    \"Here is the money for your window,\" said Jasper, putting a bill into  the fur mitten, covering Mr. Tisbett's brawny right hand. \"Kindly bring  our traps to the little brown house; here, father, take my arm,\" and he  ran after the tall figure, picking its way along the frozen road.    \"Hey--what's this?\" exclaimed Mr. Tisbett, looking into the center of  his fur mitten, \"five dollars! Gee--thumps! I ain't a-goin' to take it,  after shaking that old party almost to pieces.\"    He stood staring at the bill in stupid perplexity till the uneasy  movements of his horses warned him that his position was not exactly  the proper one for a stage-driver who was on his box from morning till  night, so he clambered over the wheel, full of vexed thoughts, and  carefully tucked the bill under the old cushion before he took his seat.    \"Ill give it back to him, that's cert'in,\" he said, picking up the  reins, \"and p'raps they've had enough walkin' so they'll let me pick  'em up,\" which raised him out of his depression not a little.    But the stern faces of the old gentleman and the tall boy smote him  with a chill, long before he passed them, and he drove by silently,  well knowing it would not do to broach the subject by so much as a look.    Not daring to go near the little brown house without the occupants of  the stage who had driven down the road with him, Mr. Tisbett drew up  miserably to a convenient angle, and waited till the two came up. Then  without trusting himself to think, he sprang to the ground, and with  shame written all over his honest face, called out, \"See here, you  young chap, I want to speak to you, when you've got him in the house.\"    \"I will see you then,\" said Jasper, as the two hurried on to meet the  Peppers rushing out from the little brown house, and down the small  path.    \"I've made an awful mess for 'em all, and they just come home,\" groaned  Mr. Tisbett; drawing his fur mitten across his eyes, and leading his  horses, he followed at a funeral pace, careful not to stop at the gate  until the door was closed, when he began furiously to unload.    A footstep crunching the snow, broke into the noise he was making.  \"Hoh! well,\" he exclaimed, pausing with a trunk half-off the rack,  \"it's a mighty awkward thing for a man to say he's sorry, but you bet I  be, as cert'in as my name's John Tisbett.\" His face became so very red  that Jasper hastened to put his young shoulder under the trunk, a  movement that only added to the stage-driver's distress.    \"It don't pay to get mad, now I tell you,\" declared Mr. Tisbett,  dumping the trunk down on the snow, and then drawing himself to his  full height; \"fust place, your pa sassed me, and\"--    \"He didn't intend to,\" cried Jasper eagerly, \"and I'll apologize for  him, if that's what you want.\" He laid his strong right hand in the old  fur mitten.    \"Good land! Tain't what I want,\" cried honest John, but he gripped the  hand nevertheless, a fact that the boy never forgot; \"I say I'm sorry I  shook up your pa.\"    \"His age ought to have protected him,\" said the boy simply.    \"Sho! that's a fact,\" cried Mr. Tisbett, sinking in deeper distress,  \"but how is anybody to remember he's so old, when he steps so almighty  high, as if he owned all Badgertown--say!\"    \"I think we shall be good friends, Mr. Tisbett,\" said Jasper cordially,  as he turned to wave his hand toward the little brown house;  simultaneously the door opened, and all the young Peppers and Whitneys  rushed out to help in the delightful unloading.    It was well along in the afternoon. The dusk of the December twilight  shut down speedily, around the little brown house and its happy  occupants, but no one wanted the candles lighted till the last moment.    \"Oh, Polly!\" cried Joel, who was prancing as of old over the kitchen  floor, \"don't you remember that night when you said you wished you had  two hundred candles, and you'd light them all at once?\"    \"I said a good many silly things in those days,\" said Polly  meditatively, and smoothing Phronsie's yellow hair that was lying  across her lap.    \"Some silly ones, and a good many wise ones,\" observed Mother Pepper,  over in her little old rocker in the west window, where she used to sit  sewing up coats and sacks for the village storekeeper. \"You kept us  together many a time, Polly, when nothing else could.\"    \"Oh! no, I didn't, Mamsie,\" protested Polly, guilty of contradicting,  \"you and Bessie did. I just washed dishes, and swept up, and\"--    \"Baked and brewed, and fussed and stewed,\" finished Joel, afraid of  being too sentimental.    \"Polly was just lovely in those days,\" said Davie, coming across the  room to lay a cool cheek against her rosy one. \"I liked the rainy days  best when we all could stay in the house, and hear her sing and tell  stories while she was working.\"    \"She was cross sometimes,\" cried Joel, determined not to let  reminiscences become too comfortable; \"she used to scold me just  awfully, I know.\"    Polly broke into a merry laugh; yet she exclaimed, \"You poor Joey, I  suppose I was dreadful!\"    \"You didn't catch one half as bad scoldings as belonged to you,\" put in  Ben, thrusting another stick in the stove. \"You were a bad lot, Joe, in  those days.\"    \"And not over good in these,\" cried old Mr. King, ensconced in the  snuggest corner in the seat of honor, the high-backed rocker that  comforted Phronsie after her little toe was hurt. \"There, now, my boy,  how's that?\" with a grim smile.    \"Do you remember when the old stove used to plague you, Polly?\" cried  Joel, suddenly changing the conversation. \"And how Ben's putty was  everlastingly tumbling out? Hoh--hoh!\"    \"And you two boys were always stuffing up the holes for me, when Ben  was away,\" cried Polly, with affectionate glances at Davie and Joel.    \"I didn't so much,\" said Joel honestly, \"Dave was always giving  boot-tops and such things.\"    \"Boot-tops!\" repeated Mr. King in astonishment. \"Bless me, I didn't  know that they had anything in common with stoves.\"    \"Oh! that was before we knew you,\" said Joel, ready in advance of any  one else with the explanation; \"it wasn't this stove. Dr. Fisher gave  Polly this one after she had the measles; but it was a lumbering old  affair that was full of holes that had to be stopped up with anything  we could get. And leather was the best; and Davie saved all the old  boot-heels and tops he could find, you know.\"    \"Oh!\" said the old gentleman, wondering if other revelations"]]]
