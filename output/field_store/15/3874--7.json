We were not long in starting a rousing fire,  and having taken from our little bark the provision we brought along,  we did justice to a hearty meal, while the gratitude of our hearts  arose in evening incense to Him, the Giver of all good, to whom we  ascribed our safe deliverance. After vocally and unitedly returning  thanks to Him for His miraculous providence in preserving us from the  perils of the night, we spread our blankets, couched down and enjoyed  refreshing sleep, with occasional interruptions by the wonderful clamor  of seemingly thousands upon thousands of wild geese, which had gathered  upon an island in the river, a short distance from our camp.    The following morning we were struck with astonishment, as we viewed,  by the light of day, the river below us thickly dotted with sand-bars  and bristling \"sawyers,\" there being, apparently, no possible chance  of having proceeded one dozen yards farther without steering nearly  a direct course to the opposite bank of the stream, which, with our  ignorance of the circumstances, and the darkness of the night, would  naturally have resulted very disastrously.    After this brief but impressive experience in the labors and dangers in  traveling on this celebrated river, we concluded to abandon our boat  and proceed on foot. In carrying out this programme, the first night  after leaving the river, we called at a gentleman's house and asked  for a night's lodging, without making ourselves known as \"Mormons.\"  We were very kindly entertained by our host, whom we soon discovered  was a bitter mobocrat, and had acted the part of leader of a mob in  raiding one of our settlements. He was very wealthy, and had with him,  as guest, a rich southern planter, who told us that he, as neutral,  accompanied his friend, the captain of the mob above mentioned, and he  narrated the particulars of the fight, and its termination. He said  that the two parties met and fought with desperation. He sheltered  himself behind a large tree which was struck by \"Mormon\" bullets,  several times. At length a parley was held, and a council between  the leaders of the parties, in which the \"Mormons\" agreed to abandon  their location. Our host and his friend said they justified the manner  in which they were expelling the \"Mormons,\" only on the ground that  they were mostly Yankees, and opposed to slavery, and they feared  that by settling in the State, the interest of the inhabitants, as  slave-holders, would be infringed upon. We all listened with respectful  attention, but those gentlemen little thought who composed their  audience, and they knew not our thoughts and the feelings of our hearts.    The next day we parted with our brethren who came down the river  with us, Brother Butterfield and I traveling together and holding  neighborhood meetings. We made the acquaintance of a Campbellite  preacher, who became so much interested with the principles we taught,  that he invited us to attend his conference, and I had a very enjoyable  time in preaching to his congregation. But opportunities for preaching,  in that time of excitement and belligerent feeling toward our people,  did not often come when unsought, and very frequently not then. The  many false reports in circulation against us were so exasperating the  feelings of the people in that section, that the spirit of mobocracy  was everywhere manifesting itself; in many instances it really assumed  the appearance of a species of insanity. Our main object was, by  giving correct information, to disabuse the minds of those we gained  access to, and allay the feverish sentiment of bitterness. Whenever  we succeeded in securing the attention of people, to listen to our  testimonies, we were pretty sure of their confidence. We held meetings  in several places where we were threatened, and in one instance  preached to a congregation in which were those who had come expressly  to mob us, but on seeing and hearing us, had changed their minds, and  at the close of the meeting, came and made their acknowledgments.    Finding, after continued efforts, that very little good could be  accomplished while excitement was running at so high pitch, and the mob  spirit so rampant, we concluded to leave the State of Missouri until  it cooled off from its fermented condition. Brother Butterfield took  for his field of labor the northern sections of Indiana and Illinois,  while I continued my course through Missouri, the southern portion of  Illinois, and into Kentucky.    Just before leaving the State, as I approached a beautiful little  village, called Jacksonville, I felt an anxiety to preach to the  people, and yet felt that it would not be proper to make myself known  as a \"Mormon\" Elder. Just as I arrived at the suburbs of the town,  I accosted a stranger whom I met, and desired him to inform me who  was the principal minister in the place. He told me the minister's  name, and said he was a Methodist, directing me to his residence. On  my arrival at the house, a very fine and intelligent appearing lady  responded to the door-bell, and informed me that her husband was not  at home. I told her I was a minister of the Gospel--a stranger in  that part of the country--that I wished to stop in town over night,  and desired to improve the opportunity of preaching to the people, if  a suitable house could be obtained. \"To what religious persuasion do  you hold, sir?\" was the first inquiry. \"I wish, madam,\" said I, \"this  evening, to speak to a promiscuous congregation, embracing all classes  of people, therefore, I had thought, on this particular occasion, and  for this special purpose, I would beg to suppress the name of the  religious denomination of which I am a minister; but,\" I continued,  \"I was christened Lorenzo, having been named as you see, madam, after  the celebrated Lorenzo Dow.\" Her eyes lighted up, and her countenance  assumed a pleasant smile; she invited me to walk in and be seated--said  her husband would be in directly--that he had charge of the principal  chapel, and would be delighted to accord to me its accommodations. The  minister soon made his appearance, to whom I was introduced by his  lady. The gentleman at once assented to my wishes--sent notice around  of the meeting, and had the bell of his chapel rung long and loud.    That evening I had a large, appreciative audience, and spoke with great  freedom; in fact, I seldom, if ever, enjoyed greater liberty than on  that occasion. What my hearers thought of me or whom they imagined I  was, or whence I came, or whither I was going, I am left in ignorance  to this day, as I was not required to inform any of my audience, and of  course was entirely reticent on those points. I stayed over night with  the minister, and after breakfast the next morning, took my departure,  no further questions having been asked in relation to my business or  profession, excepting as shown in the following incident:    At this time, I was, as usual, traveling \"without purse or scrip.\" I  had proceeded two or three miles, when I noticed that just ahead of me  the road forked, and being at a loss which to take, I called at a house  a little in the distance, to inquire. A gentleman was standing on the  porch, who, after satisfying my inquiry, with much apparent diffidence,  asked if I was not a minister of the Gospel, and if I would not allow  him the pleasure of contributing a little to aid in the good cause  in which I was engaged, at the same time drawing from his pocket the  willing offering, which I very thankfully accepted. Probably he was  one of the audience at the meeting the evening before. Not more than  an hour later, I found myself in actual need of a portion of the kind  gentleman's donation, for I soon came to a large stream where money was  necessary to pay for ferryage.    In passing through the southern portion of Illinois, I found, in  general, very little interest manifest in reference to the principles  of the fulness of the Gospel, but any amount of ignorance and prejudice.    I spent the remainder of the winter in travel and preaching,  chiefly in the northern part of Kentucky, with varied success, and  treatment--sometimes received in the most courteous manner and listened  to with intense interest, and, at other times, abusively and impudently  insulted; but in no instance treated worse than was Jesus, whom I  profess to follow. He said: \"_If they have called the master of the  house Beelzebub, how much more they of his household_?\" What a fine  test the Gospel is, to prove the hearts of the people! On one occasion,  I was very courteously tendered a court house, and at the close of  the services, I was invited home by a member of the legislature--was  seated at the head of his table, and otherwise as highly honored, and  as hospitably treated, as though I had been a sceptered monarch. Then,  on another occasion, one evening, I was preaching in a large room of a  private house, and afterwards learned that a portion of my audience had  gathered for the purpose of mobbing me. They had arranged with a party  that lay concealed at a little distance, and within call, to join them  immediately on my leaving the house to return to my lodgings, and all  proceed together to execute their schemes of vengeance. It was a very  cold night, and after the close of the services I stood with my back to  the chimney fire, with a number of others--some of whom belonged to the  mob party. One of the latter persons, amid the jostling of the crowd,  accidentally brought his hand in contact with one of the pockets in the  skirt of my coat, which struck him with sudden alarm on his feeling,  what he supposed to be, a large pistol. He immediately communicated the  discovery to his affrighted coadjutors, all of whom directly withdrew,  and, to their fellows outside, imparted the astounding "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#11)"],[1,"periodical-now some  time since happily defunct--most worthy of its title and its author. It  is into such hands Mr. Wilson unfortunately fell, and by such a person  he was evidently \"coached,\" in his study of Mormonism.    The evidence of all this, apart from the inadvertent admission of  the friendly Utah reviewer, is to be found in the identity of the  sewer-stench that attaches to the work of both; in the use of the  same materials; and the adoption of similar methods. As for instance:  A somewhat eccentric writer in the early days of the Mormon Church  characterized a number of the prominent Church leaders under what  was to him descriptive titles, such as Brigham Young, \"Lion of  the Lord;\" Wilford Woodruff, \"Banner of the Gospel;\" John Taylor,  \"Champion of Liberty.\" This evidently appealed to the erratic and  fantastical intellect of Mr. Schroeder, and led him to adopt as the  title of his intermittent, and now defunct anti-Mormon periodical,  \"Lucifer's Lantern;\" and on the title page of the last number of the  \"Lantern\" he gratuitously invents for Lorenzo Snow, then President of  the Mormon Church, the descriptive title--as he supposes--\"Boss of  Jehovah's Buckler.\" Now, Mr. Wilson having his attention directed to  the descriptive title of early leading Mormon Elders invented by the  aforesaid eccentric, though friendly writer, conceived the idea of  making the chief character of his story of the number of those who had  received such titles, and hence confers upon \"Joel Rae,\" the character  in his book about whom he centers all the horrors of his gruesome  tale, the blasphemous title--\"Lute of the Holy Ghost!\" Or was it Mr.  Schroeder; for one dreads to think that a man of the order of talents  of Mr. Wilson could stoop to the low blasphemy of such a performance;  while it is altogether in accordance both with the principles and  practice of his should-be-acknowledged collaborator, Mr. Shroeder;  for blatant atheism was and is the latter's pride and boast; and he  was wont, as we have seen by his use of it in \"Lucifer's Lantern,\" to  ascribe fanciful titles to leading Mormons.    A word, in headlines, as to the story itself; that it is possessed of  dramatic force, and literary merit will go without saying when it is  known that its author is also the author of \"The Spenders.\" That it  deals with elements capable of being so combined as to produce the most  intense human interest will be conceded when I say that it treats of  religious fanaticism--the faith--\"fanatic faith,\" that      \"Once wedded fast    To some dear idol,    Hugs it to the last;\"    of love--the theme of the ages, the one theme ever old and ever  new--the theme perennial; with human passions and ambitions, the desire  for that most deceitful end of all human ambitions--the desire for  sanctity while living, and a reputation for holiness when dead. These  the elements of the story; and now the incidents:    Joel Rae, \"bred in the word and the truth\" of Mormonism, if not born  in it, returns to Nauvoo from a mission just upon the time that the  last remnant of the Saints have departed from that ill-fated city. He  finds that the home of his parents in the outskirts of Nauvoo has been  destroyed by mobs; and that his aged father and mother were driven into  Nauvoo, where they are for the time under the protection of an apostate  family; that his fiancee, with her family, has turned from the faith,  and she is only awaiting his arrival to ascertain if he will join her  in her apostasy. This he refuses to do, and with his parents prepares  to follow his expatriated people in their great westward movement.  While being ferried over the Mississippi, the aged father of young  Rae--the son not being present--is pitched into the river by ruffian  hands and is drowned; his aged mother dies from the shock of the  horrible murder; and young Rae, made desperate by those events, becomes  a \"Son of Dan,\" a supposed secret society of the blood and thunder  order, oath-bound to \"support the First Presidency of the Church of,  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in all things, right or wrong!\"  He forms one of the band of pioneers which Brigham Young led to the  Salt Lake valley in 1847, and gives numerous evidences of increasing  fanaticism, much to the delight of the Mormon leaders, which delight  is here and there expressed in silly, blasphemous sentences of which  the following is a fair sample: \"When that young man [Rae] gets all het  up with the Holy Ghost, the Angel of the Lord just has to give down!\"  In the new home of the Saints young Rae does his full share of both  manual and spiritual labor. In the latter he succeeded too well since  he preached better, worked more seeming miracles, and prophesied more  than the other \"Lions of the Lord.\" Brigham declares him \"soul proud,\"  and sends him to the Missouri river in 1857 to bring in the handcart  companies, in which expedition he witnesses enough distress and misery  to humble the most \"soul proud\" man alive, since the sufferings of  the handcart companies from cold, famine and over toil is the result  of his own bad judgement in starting late in the season. Arriving in  Salt Lake, however, his fanatical preaching starts a \"reformation,\"  i. e., an outburst of wild fanaticism attended upon by murders, and  voluntary submissions to secret executions, to atone for the commission  of the more heinous sins. Rae's fanaticism makes him a participant in  the Mountain Meadows massacre in which it falls to his lot to kill the  young militia captain--Grimway--who had assisted Rae to leave Nauvoo,  and who subsequently married the woman to whom Rae was betrothed.  She, too, was with the emigrants attacked at Mountain Meadows, and  Rae, after killing her husband, saw her murdered and scalped by an  Indian. From the number of emigrants doomed to death Rae rescued a  white-haired boy and the little daughter of his one-time betrothed  wife, Prudence Corson. The boy he leaves at Hamblin's ranch, whence he  escapes, swearing vengeance against Rae, whom he saw kill the father  of the little girl--Prudence Grimway. The girl Prudence--named after  her mother--Rae leaves at a neighboring ranch, claiming her as his own  child, for whom he will later return. Haunted by the memories of the  awful slaughter of the gentile emigrants at Mountain Meadows, he goes  north, actively participates in the resistance to the United States'  army under Albert Sidney Johnston, then entering Utah, but is disgusted  with the final submission of Brigham Young to United States authority,  and takes up his abode in a new settlement far to the south of Salt  Lake City, and not far from the Mountain Meadows. Here his life of  penance begins. In a spirit of self-sacrifice he marries a woman with  but one hand, and a disfigured face. The hand she lost by having it  frozen while pushing a hand cart in the belated company Rae had led to  Utah years before. He also married another woman--a poor half-starved,  cast off wife of a prominent Mormon Bishop; and later still, another  wife, a shallow-witted, talkative creature who is a cross indeed to  the \"man of many sorrows.\" He takes under his protection also a poor  imbecile man, the victim of a horrible, and unnameable mutilation;  and a woman who had gone insane because her husband married another  wife. The wives, to his honor be it said, were such in name only. This  collection of the woebegone, with the child Prudence added, make up the  Rae household. The girl Prudence becomes beautiful, of course, and is  much sought by men of middle life already possessed of many wives, no  less a personage than Brigham Young being among the number; and it is  represented that the latter \"suitor\" had but to send word in advance  to the foster father of his intention to marry the girl on his next  journey south, in order to close the matrimonial incident, except the  formal word-ceremony, and taking away the bride! But Miss Prudence had  visited Salt Lake, and while there witnessed the performance at the  theater of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" which is sufficient to give her ideas of  love and matrimony all her own. The balcony scene much impressed her;  and ever afterwards became her ideal of expressed love. A few years of  dreaming on the part of the maiden, and a few years of silent suffering  on the part of Joel Rae, now the \"little man of sorrows,\" then the  lad of the Meadows, Ruel Follett, who escaped from Hamblin's ranch  swearing vengeance on Rae and two other participants in the massacre,  returns, seeking his revenge. He is now a young man, handsome, brave,  strong, aggressive. But he is baffled in his mission of retribution.  Two of the murderers he seeks are already dead some time since, and  Rae is so pitifully weak and distraught by the haunting memories of  that awful butchery that young Follett cannot find the heart to kill  him; besides there is Prudence, who loves the \"little man of sorrows\"  with true filial affection. The upshot of it all is that young Follett  leaves to time the duty of taking off Rae--an event that cannot be long  deferred, since the little man is fast hastening to the end of his  earthly career; and meantime Follett insidiously woos Prudence, and  wins her love; while she makes an unsuccessful effort to convert him to  Mormonism. In all their readings, and conversations upon the Book of  Mormon and other subjects connected with the Mormon religion, Follett  is given an easy victory over the poor girl by the employment of covert  sneers, slightly concealed sarcasms and tender ridicule. Meantime  Joel Rae has lost his faith in Mormonism; he discovers that polygamy  is wrong; the Saints abandoned of God; and on the occasion of Brigham  Young paying his annual visit to the settlement where Rae lives, he  tells the prophet and the people his discoveries. Anticipating the  vengeance of the \"Sons of Dan,\" Rae flies to the cross and cairn of  stones erected on the site of "]]]
