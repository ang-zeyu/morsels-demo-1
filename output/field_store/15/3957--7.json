And having a  very good appetite, and but little nicety, he fancied he should play  his part very well at the matrimonial banquet, without the sauce of  beauty.    To deal plainly with the reader, the captain, ever since his arrival,  at least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him,  long before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in Miss Bridget,  had been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr Allworthy's house  and gardens, and of his lands, tenements, and hereditaments; of all  which the captain was so passionately fond, that he would most  probably have contracted marriage with them, had he been obliged to  have taken the witch of Endor into the bargain.    As Mr Allworthy, therefore, had declared to the doctor that he never  intended to take a second wife, as his sister was his nearest  relation, and as the doctor had fished out that his intentions were to  make any child of hers his heir, which indeed the law, without his  interposition, would have done for him; the doctor and his brother  thought it an act of benevolence to give being to a human creature,  who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential means of  happiness. The whole thoughts, therefore, of both the brothers were  how to engage the affections of this amiable lady.    But fortune, who is a tender parent, and often doth more for her  favourite offspring than either they deserve or wish, had been so  industrious for the captain, that whilst he was laying schemes to  execute his purpose, the lady conceived the same desires with himself,  and was on her side contriving how to give the captain proper  encouragement, without appearing too forward; for she was a strict  observer of all rules of decorum. In this, however, she easily  succeeded; for as the captain was always on the look-out, no glance,  gesture, or word escaped him.    The satisfaction which the captain received from the kind behaviour of  Miss Bridget, was not a little abated by his apprehensions of Mr  Allworthy; for, notwithstanding his disinterested professions, the  captain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the example of  the rest of the world, and refuse his consent to a match so  disadvantageous, in point of interest, to his sister. From what oracle  he received this opinion, I shall leave the reader to determine: but  however he came by it, it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his  conduct so as at once to convey his affection to the lady, and to  conceal it from her brother. He at length resolved to take all private  opportunities of making his addresses; but in the presence of Mr  Allworthy to be as reserved and as much upon his guard as was  possible; and this conduct was highly approved by the brother.    He soon found means to make his addresses, in express terms, to his  mistress, from whom he received an answer in the proper form, viz.:  the answer which was first made some thousands of years ago, and which  hath been handed down by tradition from mother to daughter ever since.  If I was to translate this into Latin, I should render it by these two  words, _Nolo Episcopari_: a phrase likewise of immemorial use on  another occasion.    The captain, however he came by his knowledge, perfectly well  understood the lady, and very soon after repeated his application with  more warmth and earnestness than before, and was again, according to  due form, rejected; but as he had increased in the eagerness of his  desires, so the lady, with the same propriety, decreased in the  violence of her refusal.    Not to tire the reader, by leading him through every scene of this  courtship (which, though in the opinion of a certain great author, it  is the pleasantest scene of life to the actor, is, perhaps, as dull  and tiresome as any whatever to the audience), the captain made his  advances in form, the citadel was defended in form, and at length, in  proper form, surrendered at discretion.    During this whole time, which filled the space of near a month, the  captain preserved great distance of behaviour to his lady in the  presence of the brother; and the more he succeeded with her in  private, the more reserved was he in public. And as for the lady, she  had no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company  with the highest degree of indifference; so that Mr Allworthy must  have had the insight of the devil (or perhaps some of his worse  qualities) to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going  forward.        Chapter xii.    Containing what the reader may, perhaps, expect to find in it.      In all bargains, whether to fight or to marry, or concerning any other  such business, little previous ceremony is required to bring the  matter to an issue when both parties are really in earnest. This was  the case at present, and in less than a month the captain and his lady  were man and wife.    The great concern now was to break the matter to Mr Allworthy; and  this was undertaken by the doctor.    One day, then, as Allworthy was walking in his garden, the doctor came  to him, and, with great gravity of aspect, and all the concern which  he could possibly affect in his countenance, said, \"I am come, sir, to  impart an affair to you of the utmost consequence; but how shall I  mention to you what it almost distracts me to think of!\" He then  launched forth into the most bitter invectives both against men and  women; accusing the former of having no attachment but to their  interest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious inclinations  that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other sex.  \"Could I,\" said he, \"sir, have suspected that a lady of such prudence,  such judgment, such learning, should indulge so indiscreet a passion!  or could I have imagined that my brother--why do I call him so? he is  no longer a brother of mine----\"    \"Indeed but he is,\" said Allworthy, \"and a brother of mine too.\"    \"Bless me, sir!\" said the doctor, \"do you know the shocking affair?\"    \"Look'ee, Mr Blifil,\" answered the good man, \"it hath been my constant  maxim in life to make the best of all matters which happen. My sister,  though many years younger than I, is at least old enough to be at the  age of discretion. Had he imposed on a child, I should have been more  averse to have forgiven him; but a woman upwards of thirty must  certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy. She hath  married a gentleman, though perhaps not quite her equal in fortune;  and if he hath any perfections in her eye which can make up that  deficiency, I see no reason why I should object to her choice of her  own happiness; which I, no more than herself, imagine to consist only  in immense wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many declarations I have  made of complying with almost any proposal, have expected to have been  consulted on this occasion; but these matters are of a very delicate  nature, and the scruples of modesty, perhaps, are not to be overcome.  As to your brother, I have really no anger against him at all. He hath  no obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any necessity of  asking my consent, since the woman is, as I have said, _sui juris_,  and of a proper age to be entirely answerable only, to herself for her  conduct.\"    The doctor accused Mr Allworthy of too great lenity, repeated his  accusations against his brother, and declared that he should never  more be brought either to see, or to own him for his relation. He then  launched forth into a panegyric on Allworthy's goodness; into the  highest encomiums on his friendship; and concluded by saying, he  should never forgive his brother for having put the place which he  bore in that friendship to a hazard.    Allworthy thus answered: \"Had I conceived any displeasure against your  brother, I should never have carried that resentment to the innocent:  but I assure you I have no such displeasure. Your brother appears to  me to be a man of sense and honour. I do not disapprove the taste of  my sister; nor will I doubt but that she is equally the object of his  inclinations. I have always thought love the only foundation of  happiness in a married state, as it can only produce that high and  tender friendship which should always be the cement of this union;  and, in my opinion, all those marriages which are contracted from  other motives are greatly criminal; they are a profanation of a most  holy ceremony, and generally end in disquiet and misery: for surely we  may call it a profanation to convert this most sacred institution into  a wicked sacrifice to lust or avarice: and what better can be said of  those matches to which men are induced merely by the consideration of  a beautiful person, or a great fortune?    \"To deny that beauty is an agreeable object to the eye, and even  worthy some admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an  epithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with honour. It  was my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome,  and I can truly say I liked her the better on that account. But to  make this the sole consideration of marriage, to lust after it so  violently as to overlook all imperfections for its sake, or to require  it so absolutely as to reject and disdain religion, virtue, and sense,  which are qualities in their nature of much higher perfection, only  because an elegance of person is wanting: this is surely inconsistent,  either with a wise man or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being  too charitable to conclude that such persons mean anything more by  their marriage than to please their carnal appetites; for the  satisfaction of which, we are taught, it was not ordained.    \"In the next place, with respect to fortune. Worldly prudence,  perhaps, exacts some consideration on this head; nor will I absolutely  and altogether condemn it.

Both the masses and the feast were attended  by the women. Frequently the guilds also had a religious  ceremonial to affirm their bonds of fidelity. They readily became  connected with the exercise of trades and with the training of  apprentices. They promoted and took on public purposes such as the  repairing of roads and bridges, the relief of pilgrims, the  maintenance of schools and almshouses, and the periodic  performance of pageants and miracle plays telling scriptural  history, which could last for several days. The devil often was  prominent in miracle plays.    Many of these London guilds were known by the name of their  founding member. There were also Frith Guilds (peace guilds) and a  Knights' Guild. The Frith Guild's main object was to enforce the  King's laws, especially the prevalent problem of theft. They were  especially established by bishops and reeves. Members met monthly  and contributed about 4d. to a common fund, which paid a  compensation for items stolen. They each paid 1s. towards the  pursuit of the thief. The members were grouped in tens. Members  with horses were to track the thief. Members without horses worked  in the place of the absent horseowners until their return. When  caught, the thief was tried and executed. Overwhelming force was  used if his kindred tried to protect him. His property was used to  compensate the victim for his loss and then divided between the  thief's wife, if she was innocent, the King, and the guild. Owners  of slaves paid into a fund to give one half compensation to those  who lost slaves by theft or escape, and recaptured slaves were to  be stoned to death or hanged. The members of the peace guild also  feasted and drank together. When one died, the others each sang a  song or paid for the singing of fifty psalms for his soul and gave  a loaf.    The Knights' Guild was composed of thirteen military persons to  whom King Edgar granted certain waste land in the east of London,  toward Aldgate, and also Portsoken, which ran outside the eastern  wall of the city to the Thames, for prescribed services performed,  probably defense of the vulnerable east side of the city. This  concession was confirmed by King Edward the Confessor in a charter  at the suit of certain citizens of London, the successors of these  knights. Edward granted them sac and soke [cause and suit]  jurisdiction over their men.    Edward the Confessor made these rules for London:    1.  Be it known that within the space of three miles from      all parts outside of the city a man ought not to hold or      hinder another, and also should not do business with him if      he wish to come to the city under its peace. But when he      arrives in the city, then let the market be the same to the      rich man as to the poor.    2.  Be it also known that a man who is from the court of the      king or the barons ought not to lodge in the house of any      citizen of London for three nights, either by privilege or      by custom, except by consent of the host. For if he force      the host to lodge him in his house and there be killed by      the host, let the host choose six from his relatives and let      him as the seventh swear that he killed him for the said      cause. And thus he will remain quit of the murder of the      deceased towards the king and relatives and lords of the      deceased.    3.  And after he has entered the city, let a foreign      merchant be lodged wherever it please him. But if he bring      dyed cloth, let him see to it that he does not sell his      merchandise at retail, but that he sell not less than a      dozen pieces at a time. And if he bring pepper, or cumin, or      ginger, or alum, or brasil wood, or resin, or incense, let      him sell not less than fifteen pounds at a time. But if he      bring belts, let him sell not less than a thousand at a      time. And if he bring cloths of silk, or wool or linen, let      him see that he cut them not, but sell them whole. But if he      bring wax, let him sell not less than one quartanum. Also a      foreign merchant may not buy dyed cloth, nor make the dye in      the city, nor do any work which belongs by right to the      citizens.    4.  Also no foreign merchant with his partner may set up any      market within the city for reselling goods in the city, nor      may he approach a citizen for making a bargain, nor may he      stop longer in the City.    Every week in London there was a folkmote at St. Paul's  churchyard, where majority decision was a tradition. By 1032, it  had lost much of its power to the husting [household assembly in  Danish] court. The folkmoot then had responsibility for order and  was the sole authority for proclaiming outlaws. It met three times  a year at St. Paul's churchyard and there acclaimed the sheriff  and justiciar, or if the king had chosen his officer, heard who  was chosen and listened to his charge. It also yearly arranged the  watch and dealt with risks of fire. It was divided into wards,  each governed by an alderman who presided over the ward-mote, and  represented his ward at the folk-mote. Each guild became a ward.  The chief alderman was the portreeve. London paid one-eighth of  all the taxes of England.    Later in the towns, merchant guilds grew out of charity  associations whose members were bound by oath to each other and  got together for a guild feast every month. Some traders of these  merchant guilds became so prosperous that they became landholders.  Many market places were dominated by a merchant guild, which had a  monopoly of the local trade. In the great mercantile towns all the  land and houses would be held by merchants and their dependents,  all freeholders were connected with a trade, and everyone who had  a claim on public office or magistry would be a member of the  guild. The merchant guild could admit into their guild country  villeins, who became freemen if unclaimed by their lords for a  year and a day. Every merchant who had made three long voyages on  his own behalf and at his own cost ranked as a thegn. There were  also some craft guilds composed of handicraftsmen or artisans.  Escaped bonded agricultural workers, poor people, and traders  without land migrated to towns to live, but were not citizens.    Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from a  distance. The King's established in every shire at least one town  with a market place where purchases would be witnessed and a mint  where reliable money was coined by a moneyer. There were eight  moneyers in London. Coins were issued to be of value for only a  couple of years. Then one had to exchange them for newly issued  ones at a rate of about 10 old for 8 or 9 new. The difference  constituted a tax. Roughly 10% of the people lived in towns. Some  took surnames such as Tanner, Weaver, or Carpenter. Some had  affectionate or derisive nicknames such as clear-hand, fresh  friend, soft bread, foul beard, money taker, or penny purse.  Craftsmen in the 1000s included goldsmiths, embroiderers,  illuminators of manuscripts, and armorers.    Edward the Confessor, named such for his piety, was a king of 24  years who was widely respected for his intelligence,  resourcefulness, good judgment, and wisdom. His educated Queen  Edith, whom he relied on for advice and cheerful courage, was a  stabilizing influence on him. They were served by a number of  thegns, who had duties in the household, which was composed of the  hall, the courtyard, and the bedchamber. They were important men -  thegns by rank. They were landholders, often in several areas, and  held leading positions in the shires. They were also priests and  clerics, who maintained the religious services and performed tasks  for which literacy was necessary. Edward was the first king to  have a \"Chancellor\". He kept a royal seal and was the chief royal  chaplain. He did all the secretarial work of the household and  court, drew up and sealed the royal writs, conducted the king's  correspondence, and kept all the royal accounts. The word  \"chancellor\" signified a screen behind which the secretarial work  of the household was done. He had the special duty of securing and  administering the royal revenue from vacant benefices. The most  important royal officers were the chamberlains, who took care of  the royal bedchamber and adjoining wardrobe used for dressing and  storage of valuables, and the priests. These royal officers had at  first been responsible only for domestic duties, but gradually  came to assume public administrative tasks.    Edward wanted to avoid the pressures and dangers of living in the  rich and powerful City of London. So he rebuilt a monastic church,  an abbey, and a palace at Westminster about two miles upstream. He  started the growth of Westminster as a center of royal and  political power; kings' councils met there. Royal coronations took  place at the abbey. Since Edward traveled a lot, he established a  storehouse-treasury at Winchester to supplement his traveling  wardrobe. At this time, Spanish stallions were imported to improve  English horses. London came to have the largest and best-trained  army in England.    The court invited many of the greatest magnates and prelates  [highest ecclesiastical officials, such as bishops] of the land to  the great ecclesiastical festivals, when the king held more solemn  courts and feasted with his vassals for several days. These  included all the great earls, the majority of bishops, some  abbots, and a number of thegns and clerics. Edward had a witan of  wise men to advise him, but sometimes the King would speak in the  hall after dinner and listen to what comments were made from the  mead-benches. As the court moved about the country, many men came  to pay"]]]
