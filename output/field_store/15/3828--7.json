Sheridan, General, United States Army â€” Complete (#11)"],[1,"us, then advanced down the  island with the whole of my command, which had arrived in the mean  time; all of the men were deployed as skirmishers except a small  detachment to operate the howitzer.  Near the lower end of the island  we met, as I had anticipated, the entire body of Cascade Indianmen,  women, and children--whose homes were in the vicinity of the  Cascades.  They were very much frightened and demoralized at the turn  events had taken, for the Yakimas at the approach of Steptoe had  abandoned them, as predicted, and fled to the mountians.  The chief  and head-men said they had had nothing to do with the capture of the  Cascades, with the murder of men at the upper landing, nor with the  massacre of men, women, and children near the block-house, and put  all the blame on the Yakimas and their allies.  I did not believe  this, however, and to test the truth of their statement formed them  all in line with their muskets in hand.  Going up to the first man on  the right I accused him of having engaged in the massacre, but was  met by a vigorous denial.  Putting my forefinger into the muzzle of  his gun, I found unmistakable signs of its having been recently  discharged.  My finger was black with the stains of burnt powder, and  holding it up to the Indian, he had nothing more to say in the face  of such positive evidence of his guilt.  A further examination proved  that all the guns were in the same condition.  Their arms were at  once taken possession of, and leaving a small, force to look after  the women and children and the very old men, so that there could be  no possibility of escape, I arrested thirteen of the principal  miscreants, crossed the river to the lower landing, and placed them  in charge of a strong guard.    Late in the evening the steamboat, which I had sent back to  Vancouver, returned, bringing to my assistance from Vancouver,  Captain Henry D. Wallen's company of the Fourth Infantry and a  company of volunteers hastily organized at Portland, but as the  Cascades had already been retaken, this reinforcement was too late to  participate in the affair.  The volunteers from Portland, however,  were spoiling for a fight, and in the absence of other opportunity  desired to shoot the prisoners I held (who, they alleged, had killed  a man named Seymour), and proceeded to make their arrangements to do  so, only desisting on being informed that the Indians were my  prisoners, subject to the orders of Colonel Wright, and would be  protected to the last by my detachment.  Not long afterward Seymour  turned up safe and sound, having fled at the beginning of the attack  on the Cascades, and hid somewhere in the thick underbrush until the  trouble was over, and then made his way back to the settlement.  The  next day I turned my prisoners over to Colonel Wright, who had them  marched to the upper landing of the Cascades, where, after a trial by  a military commission, nine of them were sentenced to death and duly  hanged.  I did not see them executed, but was afterward informed  that, in the absence of the usual mechanical apparatus used on such  occasions, a tree with a convenient limb under which two empty  barrels were placed, one on top of the other, furnished a rude but  certain substitute.  In executing the sentence each Indian in turn  was made to stand on the top barrel, and after the noose was adjusted  the lower barrel was knocked away, and the necessary drop thus  obtained.  In this way the whole nine were punished.  Just before  death they all acknowledged their guilt by confessing their  participation in the massacre at the block-house, and met their doom  with the usual stoicism of their race.          CHAPTER VI.    MISDIRECTED VENGEANCE--HONORABLE MENTION--CHANGE OF COMMAND--EDUCATED  OXEN--FEEDING THE INDIANS--PURCHASING A BURYING-GROUND--KNOWING RATS.    While still encamped at the lower landing, some three or four days  after the events last recounted, Mr. Joseph Meek, an old frontiersman  and guide for emigrant trains through the mountains, came down from  the Dalles, on his way to Vancouver, and stopped at my camp to  inquire if an Indian named Spencer and his family had passed down to  Vancouver since my arrival at the Cascades.  Spencer, the head of the  family, was a very influential, peaceable Chinook chief, whom Colonel  Wright had taken with him from Fort Vancouver as an interpreter and  mediator with the Spokanes and other hostile tribes, against which  his campaign was directed.  He was a good, reliable Indian, and on  leaving Vancouver to join Colonel Wright, took his family along, to  remain with relatives and friends at Fort Dalles until the return of  the expedition.  When Wright was compelled to retrace his steps on  account of the capture of the Cascades, this family for some reason  known only to Spencer, was started by him down the river to their  home at Vancouver.    Meek, on seeing the family leave the Dalles, had some misgivings as  to their safe arrival at their destination, because of the excited  condition of the people about the Cascades; but Spencer seemed to  think that his own peaceable and friendly reputation, which was  widespread, would protect them; so he parted from his wife and  children with little apprehension as to their safety.  In reply to  Meek's question, I stated that I had not seen Spencer's family, when  he remarked, \"Well, I fear that they are gone up,\" a phrase used in  that country in early days to mean that they had been killed.  I  questioned him closely, to elicit further information, but no more  could be obtained; for Meek, either through ignorance or the usual  taciturnity of his class, did not explain more fully, and when the  steamer that had brought the reinforcement started down the river, he  took passage for Vancouver, to learn definitely if the Indian family  had reached that point.  I at once sent to the upper landing, distant  about six miles, to make inquiry in regard to the matter, and in a,  little time my messenger returned with the information that the  family had reached that place the day before, and finding that we had  driven the hostiles off, continued their journey on foot toward my  camp, from which point they expected to go by steamer down the river  to Vancouver.    Their non-arrival aroused in me suspicions of foul play, so with all  the men I could spare, and accompanied by Lieutenant William T.  Welcker, of the Ordnance Corps--a warm and intimate friend--I went in  search of the family, deploying the men as skirmishers across the  valley, and marching them through the heavy forest where the ground  was covered with fallen timber and dense underbrush, in order that no  point might escape our attention.  The search was continued between  the base of the mountain and the river without finding any sign of  Spencer's family, until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when we  discovered them between the upper and lower landing, in a small open  space about a mile from the road, all dead--strangled to death with  bits of rope.  The party consisted of the mother, two youths, three  girls, and a baby.  They had all been killed by white men, who had  probably met the innocent creatures somewhere near the blockhouse,  driven them from the road into the timber, where the cruel murders  were committed without provocation, and for no other purpose than the  gratification of the inordinate hatred of the Indian that has often  existed on the frontier, and which on more than one occasion has  failed to distinguish friend from foe.  The bodies lay in a  semicircle, and the bits of rope with which the poor wretches had  been strangled to death were still around their necks.  Each piece of  rope--the unwound strand of a heavier piece--was about two feet long,  and encircled the neck of its victim with a single knot, that must  have been drawn tight by the murderers pulling at the ends.  As there  had not been quite enough rope to answer for all, the babe was  strangled by means of a red silk handkerchief, taken, doubtless, from  the neck of its mother.  It was a distressing sight.  A most cruel  outrage had been committed upon unarmed people--our friends and  allies--in a spirit of aimless revenge.  The perpetrators were  citizens living near the middle block-house, whose wives and children  had been killed a few days before by the hostiles, but who well knew  that these unoffending creatures had had nothing to do with those  murders.    In my experience I have been obliged to look upon many cruel scenes  in connection with Indian warfare on the Plains since that day, but  the effect of this dastardly and revolting crime has never been  effaced from my memory.  Greater and more atrocious massacres have  been committed often by Indians; their savage nature modifies one's  ideas, however, as to the inhumanity of their acts, but when such  wholesale murder as this is done by whites, and the victims not only  innocent, but helpless, no defense can be made for those who  perpetrated the crime, if they claim to be civilized beings.  It is  true the people at the Cascades had suffered much, and that their  wives and children had been murdered before their eyes, but to wreak  vengeance on Spencer's unoffending family, who had walked into their  settlement under the protection of a friendly alliance, was an  unparalleled outrage which nothing can justify or extenuate.  With as  little delay as possible after the horrible discovery, I returned to  camp, had boxes made, and next day buried the bodies of these hapless  victims of misdirected vengeance.    The summary punishment inflicted on the nine Indians, in their trial  and execution, had a most salutary effect on the confederation, and  was the entering wedge to its disintegration; and though Colonel  Wright's campaign continued during the summer and into the early  winter, the subjugation of the allied bands became a comparatively  easy matter after the lesson taught"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#11)"],[1,"acle\" only an error of  interpretation? A lack of philology?    48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their  Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and  that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite  different from what it does among Protestants--namely, a sort of revolt  against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to  the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.    We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even  as regards our talents for religion--we have POOR talents for it. One  may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore  furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the  Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun  of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still  these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their  origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte's Sociology  seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that  amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all  his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to  us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom  every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined  voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat  after him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness is  immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but  harder souls, that is to say, in our more German souls!--\"DISONS DONC  HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L'HOMME NORMAL, QUE L'HOMME  EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS  ASSURE D'UNE DESTINEE INFINIE.... C'EST QUAND IL EST BON QU'IL VEUT QUE  LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN ORDER ETERNAL, C'EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES  CHOSES D'UNE MANIERE DESINTERESSEE QU'IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET  ABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C'EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE  L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?\"... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL  to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage  on finding them, I wrote on the margin, \"LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR  EXCELLENCE!\"--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these  sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a  distinction to have one's own antipodes!    49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient  Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours  forth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude  towards nature and life.--Later on, when the populace got the upper hand  in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was  preparing itself.    50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and  importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther--the whole of Protestantism  lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the  mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as  in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive  manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine  tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs  for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In  many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's  or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid,  also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman  in such a case.    51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before  the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary  privation--why did they thus bow? They divined in him--and as it were  behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--the  superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the  strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and  love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something  in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the  contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an  enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been  coveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a  reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might  wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and  visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new  fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered  enemy:--it was the \"Will to Power\" which obliged them to halt before the  saint. They had to question him.    52. In the Jewish \"Old Testament,\" the book of divine justice, there are  men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian  literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and  reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and  one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula  Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the  \"Progress of Mankind.\" To be sure, he who is himself only a slender,  tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like  our cultured people of today, including the Christians of \"cultured\"  Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--the  taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to \"great\" and  \"small\": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,  still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the  genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound  up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along  with the Old Testament into one book, as the \"Bible,\" as \"The Book in  Itself,\" is perhaps the greatest audacity and \"sin against the Spirit\"  which literary Europe has upon its conscience.    53. Why Atheism nowadays? \"The father\" in God is thoroughly refuted;  equally so \"the judge,\" \"the rewarder.\" Also his \"free will\": he does  not hear--and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst  is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he  uncertain?--This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening  at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of  European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is  in vigorous growth,--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound  distrust.    54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes--and  indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--an  ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old  conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject  and predicate conception--that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the  fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy,  as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN,  although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.  Formerly, in effect, one believed in \"the soul\" as one believed in  grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, \"I\" is the condition,  \"think\" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for  which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made,  with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out  of this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: \"think\" the  condition, and \"I\" the conditioned; \"I,\" therefore, only a synthesis  which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove  that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved--nor  the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the  subject, and therefore of \"the soul,\" may not always have been strange  to him,--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the  Vedanta philosophy.    55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but  three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed  human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the  best--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive  religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the  Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman  anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed  to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their \"nature\";  THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and  \"anti-natural\" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?  Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything  comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in  future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God  himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity,  gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness--this  paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the  rising generation; we all know something thereof already.    56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long  endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it  from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which  it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of  Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic  eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of  all possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil, and no longer  like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of  morality,--whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without  really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the  ideal of the most "]]]
