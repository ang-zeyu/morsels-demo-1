There were three entrances to the nest, one on each side  of the rock.    This mouse was captured again on August 12, 1964, released and followed  to a hollow juniper log 15 feet south of station C7b, and 245 feet from  the above nest. This log was dismantled, but no nest was found. A large  number of chewed juniper seeds around the log indicated that this mouse,  or others, had frequented the area.    On August 20, 1964, this female was followed to a large juniper log 20  feet northeast of station I4b. A small nest of shredded juniper bark was  found inside the log, and there were numerous nuts of pinyon pine and  seeds of Utah juniper that had been gnawed open. This site was about 320  feet from that at C7b, and about 240 feet from station I4d (Fig. 15).    No. 118, _P. truei_, young. On August 29, 1963, this male ran into a  hollow branch of a partly dead juniper tree 15 feet south of station  C5d. Part of this branch had been sawed off at some earlier time, and a  hole about one-and-a-half inches in diameter was present in the center  of the remaining part. The branch was not dissected, but probing  revealed that the hole extended far into the branch and enlarged as it  approached the trunk.    No. 177, _P. truei_, adult. This lactating female ran into the hollow  trunk of a juniper 10 feet north of station G7a. Both lateral branches  of the main trunk were rotten and hollow, but the tree appeared to be  healthy. Chewed juniper seeds were present in the trunks and around the  base of the tree.    This female later ran to a juniper log 30 feet north of station N4d.  Apparently there was no permanent nest at this site (Fig. 15).    No. 178, _P. truei_, adult. This female ran into a hollow juniper tree  10 feet south of station H3c. Hundreds of old juniper seeds, with their  embryos chewed out, were present at the base of the tree. The tree was  not cut down.    No. 238, _P. truei_, adult. This male ran into a dead juniper log 10  feet south of station O4b. Chewed juniper seeds were present on the  ground, but no nest was found in the log.        [Illustration: FIG. 15: Diagrams showing estimated home ranges of         six individuals of two species of _Peromyscus_, and location of         these ranges in the trapping grid.

This male ran into a small hole at the base  of a juniper tree 25 feet south of station G7c. The hole was at the fork  of the tree, four inches above the ground, and led to a large  subterranean chamber in the basal part of the trunk.    This male later ran into a dead juniper log lying on the ground 20 feet  southwest of station N3b. No nest was found in the log.    After another capture, this mouse ran to a small juniper log 40 feet  southeast of station G3d. There was a nest of shredded juniper bark and  many juniper seeds inside the log (Figs. 15-17).    No. 245, _P. truei_, adult. This female ran into a large, hollow juniper  log 20 feet northwest of station D4d. No nest was seen, but chewed  juniper seeds were noted in and around the log (Fig. 15).    No. 251, _P. truei_, juvenile. This female ran into a dead juniper log  beside station P4b. Chewed cones of pinyon pine and chewed juniper seeds  were on the ground. A small nest of shredded juniper bark, and a few  leaves of serviceberry, were found inside the log. Chewed pinyon nuts  and juniper seeds also were present in the nest.        [Illustration: FIG. 16: (above) Photograph of juniper log at station         G3d, which contained the nest of _P. truei_ # 241.]        [Illustration: FIG. 17: (below) Photograph of dissected juniper log         at station G3d, showing the nest of _P. truei_ # 241, at end of         mattock handle. The nest of shredded juniper bark contained         chewed seeds of juniper trees.]    No. 267, _P. truei_, juvenile. This male ran into a fallen juniper log  40 feet southwest of station P7a and then disappeared into a hole  leading under an adjacent rock. Dissection of the log revealed many  chewed juniper seeds inside and beneath the log, but no nest. I did not  overturn the large rock or excavate under it.    No. 268, _P. truei_, adult. This pregnant and lactating female ran into  a hollow branch of a partly-dead juniper tree 10 feet south of station  O7d. The limb and base of the tree were hollow, and there were large  numbers of chewed juniper seeds nearby. Because of time limitations, the  branch was not dissected.    No. 74, _P. maniculatus_, juvenile. This female ran into a small  circular hole in the ground 13 feet north of station J3a. Excavation  revealed that this hole led into the abandoned tunnel of a pocket gopher  (_Thomomys bottae_). The tunnel was followed for about four feet, but no  nest was found and the tunnel led under a thicket of oak brush which  made further excavation impractical (Fig. 15).    No. 247, _P. maniculatus_, adult. This male was followed to a large nest  situated at the base of a stump and under a juniper log lying beside the  stump, five feet from station I2c. This large nest was built on the  ground and was constructed of grasses (_Poa fendleriana_, _Stipa  comata_, and _Koeleria cristata_), and contained a few leaves of Gambel  oak. It was the largest nest found. Chewed pinyon nuts were in the nest.  (Fig. 15).    No. 276, _P. maniculatus_, juvenile. This male ran into a small hole at  the base of a dead juniper tree 40 feet north of station O2c. It would  have been necessary to cut the tree down to uncover the nest, and this  was not deemed to be worthwhile.    The preceding accounts indicate that, in Mesa Verde, nests of _P. truei_  usually are associated with hollow juniper logs or branches. In one  instance a nest of _P. truei_ was found on the ground, under a rock.  Shredded juniper bark, and, in one case, grasses were the materials most  commonly used for nest building.    Individuals of _P. maniculatus_ did not build nests in trees. One nest  was found under a stump and adjacent log. Another site was in the  abandoned tunnel of a pocket gopher, and a third was under a large rock.  The only nest that was unquestionably built by a _P. maniculatus_ was  constructed of grasses and a few leaves.    It seems unlikely that competition for nesting sites between the two  species of _Peromyscus_ affects the local distribution of each species.  The analysis of nesting sites suggests that _P. truei_ is restricted, in  Mesa Verde, by the availability of fallen logs, hollow branches, or  hollow trunks of juniper trees. My observations lead me to think that  within the pinyon-juniper woodland there is a surplus of nesting sites  for individuals of _P. truei_. Many juniper trees have dead branches,  and hollow juniper logs are abundant throughout the forest. It is  inconceivable to me that the population of _P. truei_ could reach  densities sufficient to saturate every nesting site available to them in  the trapping grid.    Sagebrush areas, or brushy zones adjacent to the pinyon-juniper woodland  usually do not contain juniper logs; when hollow juniper trees or logs  are not available, _P. truei_ is not found as resident of such areas. As  mentioned earlier, individuals of _P. truei_ may venture into such areas  to feed if they are adjacent to pinyon-juniper woodland.    An individual of _P. truei_ may have more than one nest within its home  range (for example Nos. 105 and 241 cited above). Each mouse probably  has refuges, each containing a nest, strategically located in its home  range. Thus, if a mouse is chased by a predator, or by another mouse, it  need not return to its main nest, but can seek refuge in one of its  secondary nests. These secondary nests were small and were invariably  constructed from shredded juniper bark. Some of these nests were little  more than a scant handful of shredded bark that formed a platform to sit  upon. Other nests were larger and ball-shaped, with one opening on the  side. All of the secondary nests that were found were inside hollow  juniper logs. The bark used in construction of the nests had, in each  case, been transported from nearby living trees. The logs had previously  lost their bark through decay.    The evidence indicates that these secondary refuges are prepared with  considerable care. Not only is the bark transported for some distance,  but it is shredded into a soft mass of fibers. When a mouse first  establishes itself in a new area, perhaps it begins several such nests  before settling upon the most favorable site. The less desirable sites,  if still within the animal's range, are then available (barring  competition by a new inhabitant) for outlying refuges.    My data do not indicate whether individuals of _P. maniculatus_ use a  similar arrangement of nests within their home ranges. The population of  _P. maniculatus_ was sparse in the trapping grid, and the habitat these  mice occupied was such as to make following them extremely difficult.    In captivity, both species constructed nests that were indistinguishable  to me, when the mice were given cotton, kapok, or pieces of burlap as  building material. The cotton or kapok was used directly, but the burlap  was shredded into a fine mass of fluffy fibers. The burlap seemed to me  to be the best building material, for it maintained its shape best.    Both species constructed nests that resembled inverted bowls. Solitary  mice naturally built smaller nests than those built by females with  young.    The entrance to the closed nests varied; often the female would bolt  through the side of the nest where there was no opening. Sometimes the  mice would exit and enter through the top"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38961"],[0,"Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle, (#11)"],[1,".[35] It is very  difficult to kill them, on account of their wariness and thick coat of  feathers, which is impenetrable by any thing smaller than swan shot. The  flavour of their flesh is so strong and fishy, that at first we killed them  solely for specimens. Five or six months, however, on salt provisions,  taught many to think such food palatable, and the seamen never lost an  opportunity of eating them. I have preferred these ducks to salt-beef, but  more as a preventive against scurvy, than from liking their taste.    I am averse to altering names, particularly in natural history, without  very good reason, but in this case I do think the name of 'steamer' much  more appropriate, and descriptive of the swift paddling motion of these  birds, than that of 'race-horse.' I believe, too, the name of 'steamer' is  now generally given to it by those who have visited these regions.    Many shells[36] were taken from the bottom by means of a fizgig which Mr.  Tarn found in one of the wigwams: it was a {37} rough pole, eight or ten  feet long, split crosswise at one end, and opened so as to form four  prongs, kept apart by two small pieces of wood. Although rudely made, it  was excellently adapted for a shell-gatherer, and is used by the Indians  for collecting sea-eggs, which are found in the Strait of very large size,  and are doubtless, to them, a great delicacy.    During our excursion we ascertained the best place to ascend the snowy  mountain, since named 'Tarn;' and the surgeon, whose name it bears, set off  with a party of officers to make the attempt, in which he succeeded, and  obtained such an extensive view as induced me to decide upon ascending it,  a few days afterwards, to procure bearings from the summit, and for the  purpose of measuring its height with a barometer.    In the meantime I visited the Sedger river (Sarmiento's 'Rio de San Juan de  Posesion'), and found some difficulty in entering it, because of several  banks which are dry at low water. Between them, however, the stream keeps a  small channel open, by which we effected our purpose. Every gale of wind  causes the banks to shift, and between the times of our first, and last,  visit to Port Famine, the river's mouth underwent many changes. The bed of  the river is so full of fallen trees, that we could not go, with the boat,  more than three miles and a half above the entrance; there it was about  fifteen yards wide, bounded on each side by thickly wooded banks, of  moderate height. The trees on these banks are large, chiefly the two  species of Beech before-mentioned, and Winter's-bark; there are besides  many shrubs, and an impenetrable underwood of Arbutus, Berberis, and  currant bushes. The largest Beech-tree that we saw could not have been more  than thirty or forty inches in diameter, which was insignificant compared  with those noticed by Commodore Byron. In describing his excursion up this  river, he mentions \"trees that would supply the British navy with the best  masts in the world.\"[37] \"Some of them are of a great height, and more than  eight feet in diameter, which is proportionally more than eight yards in  {38} circumference.\"[38] The Commodore may have been pleased by the  appearance of these trees, but must have fancied their quality and  dimensions such as he describes. The largest are generally rotten at the  heart, and all are more or less defective. Their wood is heavy, and far too  brittle for masts: we could not use it even for boat-hook staves. It makes,  however, tolerable plank for boat-building, and, when seasoned, might be  used in ships. For common purposes, such as houses, or fences, it is very  serviceable.    We wandered about to examine the country; but, excepting the track of some  quadruped, whose foot was small and cloven, rather like a pig's, we saw  nothing new. The traces of foxes were numerous every where. We found no  fish of any description in the river. Geese and wild ducks were numerous,  whose young were at this time scarcely fledged, and an easy prey. We also  observed here, for the first time, the parroquet, which Bougainville  described to be common in the Strait. He carried specimens home with him;  but some naturalists of those days decided that there must have been a  mistake, because, as they averred, parroquets did not exist in so high a  latitude. Bougainville, however, made no mistake, for the species[39] is  very abundant in the neighbourhood of Port Famine, and has been seen by us  in all parts of the Strait. It feeds principally upon the seeds of the  Winter's-bark. The existence of this bird in Tierra del Fuego is also  mentioned by Cook and Narborough.[40]    {39}    All accounts of Port Famine informed us of its abounding in fish, but as  yet we had taken none excepting with hook and line, although the seine had  been frequently shot. At last, however, in the first week of February, we  had a successful haul of mullet and smelts, many of the former weighing  eight pounds, and the latter measuring fifteen inches in length. After this  we were often very fortunate, and on one occasion caught, at one haul of  the seine, sixteen hundred-weight of smelts, some weighing two pounds, and  measuring twenty inches in length. A few days previously we had a draught  of mullet, which served the crews of both Adventure and Beagle for three  days. Geese, wild ducks and teal, snipe, and now and then woodcocks, were  to be found by taking a short walk; there were, however, no quadrupeds fit  for food which we could take. Foxes and wild cats were occasionally seen,  and a foot-mark of some large animal of the feline race, probably a puma,  was once observed upon the beach. We found many traces of horses, which  showed that the Patagonian Indians sometimes come thus far south. Had we  been so fortunate as to meet them here, we might have procured, perhaps, a  regular supply of guanaco meat.    On the 9th of February, as the weather seemed favourable for ascending  Mount Tarn,[41] Lieutenant Cooke, the Surgeon, and Anderson, the botanical  collector, set off in advance to select a convenient place for passing the  night, carrying with them a tent and provisions. I followed later in the  day, and, while the boat's crew were arranging their loads, made some  observations with a barometer on the beach.    Our way led through thick underwood, and then, with a gradual ascent, among  fallen trees, covered with so thick a coating of moss, that at every step  we sunk up to the knees {40} before firm footing could be found. It was  very laborious work, and the ground being saturated, and each tree dripping  with moisture, we were soon wet through. We proceeded along the same sort  of road up a steep ascent; some one of the party constantly falling into  deep holes covered by moss, or stumbling over fallen trunks of trees. As I  carried a barometer I was obliged to proceed with caution, and succeeded in  emerging from this jungle without accident. After about three quarters of  an hour spent in this way, we reached an open space, where we rested, and I  set up the barometer. Here we found a cypress of very stunted growth.    Our road hence was rather more varied: always steep, but sometimes free  from impediment. Here and there we observed the boggy soil was faced with a  small plant (_Chamitis sp._) of a harsh character, growing so thick and  close as to form large tufts, over which we walked as on hard ground. We  struggled through several thickets of stunted beech-trees, with a thick  jungle of Berberis underneath, whose strong and sharp thorns penetrated our  clothes at every step; and began to find the fatigue very oppressive: some  of my boat's crew suffered much, being unused to such exercise. At last we  approached the place where Mr. Cooke and his party had established  themselves, and upon hailing, were invigorated by a cheer in reply. We  reached the bivouac in a very way-worn condition, and found, to our great  comfort, the tent pitched, and a good fire burning.[42]    The ground was so exceedingly wet, that although we slept upon branches,  forming a layer at least a foot thick, we found ourselves, in the night,  lying as if in a morass, and suffering from cold, even with a large fire  blazing at our feet. At daylight next morning, just as we were starting, a  boat was seen sailing round Cape San Isidro, which, by the aid of a  telescope, I made out to be the Hope.    We resumed the ascent, and passed over, rather than through, thickets of  the crumply-leaved beech, which, from {41} their exposure to the prevailing  winds, rose no higher than twelve or fourteen inches from the ground, with  widely-spreading branches, so closely interwoven, as to form a platform  that bore our weight in walking. We next traversed an extent of  table-land,[43] much intersected by ponds of water. Mr. Tarn shot two  plovers of a new species (_Charadrius rubecola_, Zool. Jour. vol. iv. p.  96), and a snipe. We then ascended three or four hundred feet, and crossed  a deep ravine. The bottom of the ravine was clay-slate in a decomposing  state, but the surface of the ground was strewed with pebbles of granite.  Another plain, with many ponds, succeeded; the intervening spaces being  covered with tufts of chamitis, and studded here and there with small  clusters of dwarf beech; but the ground was so hard, and firm, that we  proceeded rapidly, without fatigue, until we attained the height of 1,800  feet, when the ascent became very steep. Near the summit lay a large mass  of snow, rapidly melting away. We reached the highest pinnacle of the mount  at seven o'clock (having left our resting-place at four), and immediately  set up the instruments. I was obliged to avail myself of Mr. Tarn's  assistance to hold the barometer, whilst two of my boat's crew held the  legs of the theodolite-stand, for the wind was blowing very strongly, and  the edge of a precipice was close to us, perpendicular for many hundred  feet, and"]]]
