First came the _commercium_, that is, the  right of possessing and transmitting according to the Roman law; next  the _connubium_, or the right of contracting marriage with the  advantages established by Roman legislation.[165] The _commercium_ and  _connubium_ united formed the Quiritary law (_jus quiritium_).    There were three sorts of municipia:[166] first, the municipia of which  the inhabitants, inscribed in the tribes, exercised all the rights and  were subjected to all the obligations of the Roman citizens; secondly,  the municipia _sine suffragio_, the inhabitants of which enjoyed in  totality or in part the Quiritary law, and might obtain the complete  right of Roman citizens on certain conditions;[167] it is what  constituted the _jus Latii_; these first two categories preserved their  autonomy and their magistrates; third, the towns which had lost all  independence in exchange for the civil laws of Rome, but without  enjoyment, for the inhabitants, of the most important political rights;  it was the law of the _Caerites_, because Caere was the first town which  had been thus treated.[168]    Below the municipia, which had their own magistrates, came, in this  social hierarchy, the prefectures,[169] so called because a prefect was  sent there every year to administer justice.    The _dediticii_ were still worse treated. Delivered by victory to the  discretion of the Senate, they had been obliged to surrender their arms  and give hostages, to throw down their walls or receive a garrison  within them, to pay a tax, and to furnish a determinate contingent. With  the exclusion of these last, the towns which had not obtained for their  inhabitants the complete rights of Roman citizens belonged to the class  of allies (_foederati socii_). Their condition differed according to  the nature of their engagements. Simple treaties of friendship,[170] or  of commerce,[171] or of offensive alliance, or offensive and  defensive,[172] concluded on the footing of equality, were called  _foedera aequa_. On the contrary, when one of the contracting parties  (and it was never the Romans) submitted to onerous obligations from  which the other was exempted, these treaties were called _foedera non  aequa_. They consisted almost always in the cession of a part of the  territory of the vanquished, and in the obligation to undertake no war  of their own. A certain independence, it is true, was left to them; they  received the right of exchange and free establishment in the capital,  but they were bound to the interests of Rome by an alliance offensive  and defensive. The only clause establishing the preponderance of Rome  was conceived in these terms: _Majestatem populi Romani comiter  conservanto_;[173] that is, \"They shall loyally acknowledge the  supremacy of the Roman people.\" It is a remarkable circumstance that,  dating from the reign of Augustus, the freedmen were divided in  categories similar to those which existed for the inhabitants of  Italy.[174]    As to the colonies, they were established for the purpose of preserving  the possessions acquired, of securing the new frontiers, and of guarding  the important passes; and even for the sake of getting rid of the  turbulent class.[175] They were of two sorts: the Roman colonies and the  Latin colonies. The former differed little from the municipia of the  first degree, the others from the municipia of the second degree. The  first were formed of Roman citizens, taken with their families from the  classes subjected to military service, and even, in their origin, solely  among the patricians. The _coloni_ preserved the privileges attached to  the title of citizen,[176] and were bound by the same obligations, and  the interior administration of the colony was an image of that of  Rome.[177]    The Latin colonies differed from the others in having been founded by  the confederacy of the Latins on different points of Latium. Emanating  from a league of independent cities, they were not, like the Roman  colonies, tied by close bonds to the metropolis.[178] But the  confederacy once dissolved, these colonies were placed in the rank of  allied towns (_socii Latini_). The act (_formula_) which instituted them  was a sort of _treaty_ guaranteeing their franchise.[179]    Peopled at first by Latins, it was not long before these colonies  received Roman citizens who were induced by their poverty to exchange  their title and rights for the advantages assured to the colonists.  These did not figure on the lists of the censors. The _formula_ fixed  simply the tribute to pay and the number of soldiers to furnish. What  the colony lost in privileges it gained in independence.[180]    The isolation of the Latin colonies, placed in the middle of the enemy's  territory, obliged them to remain faithful to Rome, and to keep watch on  the neighbouring peoples. Their military importance was at least equal  to that of the Roman colonies; they merited as well as these latter the  name of _propugnacula imperii_ and of _specula_,[181] that is, bulwarks  and watch-towers of the conquest. In a political point of view they  rendered services of a similar kind. If the Roman colonies announced to  the conquered people the majesty of the Roman name, their Latin sisters  gave an ever-increasing extension to the _nomen Latinum_,[182] that is,  to the language, manners, and whole civilisation of that race of which  Rome was but the first representative. The Latin colonies were  ordinarily founded to economise the colonies of Roman citizens, which  were charged principally with the defence of the coasts and the  maintenance of commercial relations with foreign people.    In making the privileges of the Roman citizen an advantage which every  one was happy and proud to acquire, the Senate held out a bait to all  ambitions; and this general desire, not to destroy the privilege, but to  gain a place among the privileged, is a characteristic trait of the  manners of antiquity. In the city not less than in the State, the  insurgents or discontented did not seek, as in our modern societies, to  overthrow, but to attain to. So every one, according to his position,  aspired to a legitimate object: the plebeians to enter into the  aristocracy, not to destroy it; the Italic peoples, to have a part in  the sovereignty of Rome, not to contest it; the Roman provinces to be  declared allies and friends of Rome, and not to recover their  independence.    The peoples could judge, according to their conduct, what lot was  reserved for them. The paltry interests of city were replaced by an  effectual protection, and by new rights often more precious, in the eyes  of the vanquished, than independence itself. This explains the facility  with which the Roman domination was established. In fact, that only is  destroyed entirely which may be replaced advantageously.    A rapid glance at the wars which effected the conquest of Italy will  show how the Senate made application of the principles stated above; how  it was skilful in profiting by the divisions of its adversaries, in  collecting its whole strength to overwhelm one of them; after the  victory in making it an ally; in using the aims and resources of that  ally to subjugate another people; in crushing the confederacies which  united the vanquished against it; in attaching them to Rome by new  bonds; in establishing military posts on all the points of strategic  importance; and, lastly, in spreading everywhere the Latin race by  distributing to Roman citizens a part of the lands taken from the enemy.    But, before entering upon the recital of events, we must cast a glance  upon the years which immediately preceded the pacification of Latium.      [Sidenote: Submission of Latium after the first Samnite War.]    IV. During a hundred and sixty-seven years, Rome had been satisfied with  struggling against her neighbours to re-conquer a supremacy lost since  the fall of her kings. She held herself almost always on the defensive;  but, with the fifth century, she took the offensive, and inaugurated the  system of conquests continued to the moment when she herself succumbed.    In 411, she had, in concert with the Latins, combated the Samnites for  the first time, and commenced against that redoubtable people a  struggle which lasted seventy-two years, and which brought twenty-four  triumphs to the Roman generals.[183] Proud of having contributed to the  two great victories of Mount Gaurus and Suessula, the Latins, with an  exaggerated belief in their own strength and a pretension to equality  with Rome, went so far as to require that one of the two consuls, and  half of the senators, should be chosen from their nation. War was  immediately declared. The Senate was willing enough to have allies and  subjects, but it could not suffer equals; it accepted without scruple  the services of those who had just been enemies, and the Romans, united  with the Samnites, the Hernici, and the Sabellian peoples, were seen in  the fields of the Veseris and Trifanum, fighting against the Latins and  Volsci. Latium once reduced, it remained to determine the lot of the  vanquished. Livy reports a speech of Camillus which explains clearly the  policy recommended by that great citizen. \"Will you,\" he exclaims,  addressing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],[0,"The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#11)"],[1,"he shall begin, and when he leaveth off, he  shall be at a loss\" (Ecclesiasticus 18:2).    A being cannot be at the same time infinite and finite, necessary and  contingent, compound and simple, unchangeable and changeable, eternal  and temporary, omnipotent and weak, actual being and potentiality,  etc., etc.    Now if God were an exalted man, he would have all those contradictory  attributes at the same time, which is absurd. Therefore, it is an utter  impossibility that God should be an exalted man.    As to man becoming God, the idea is absurd. With far more reason  might we contend that the gnat will develop into a lion, and the  animalcules which we swallow in a sip of water will grow into gigantic  giraffes and colossal elephants, as there is infinitely less distance  or difference between those respective animals than between the most  perfect creature and the Creator, the finite and the infinite. Bring  all the scientists of the world together, the Darwins, the Huxleys,  the Tyndalls, the Pasteurs, the Kochs, the Teslas, the Edisons, etc.,  etc., supply them with the most ingenious machinery, and the most  complicated instruments, and with unlimited material, let them make,  I will not say an imitation sun or moon, but simply a little worm as  we often unconsciously crush under our feet, or let them produce not  the magnificent lily or rose, but a tiny blade of grass. Before such  a task, apparently so insignificant, those profound mathematicians,  naturalists and chemists, will throw up their hands in utter impotence.  Expert mixers can indeed make wines in their laboratories, but will  President Roosevelt or Emperor William, or other sovereigns, ever give  them an order to manufacture a little bunch of grapes or a few of the  commonest berries?    What frequent accidents are there on our railroads, despite most  careful and most attentive trainmen! Yet a collision never occurred  between the millions of suns, stars and planets that whirl, rush,  tear and bound wildly along their prescribed pathways for thousands  or millions of years, at the rate of over one thousand miles a minute  (our earth), and three thousand miles a minute (the planet Arcturus).  Notwithstanding the bewildering speed of their movements, the stars  and planets float through space with such regularity and precision,  and along such well defined paths, deviating neither to the right nor  to the left, that astronomers can foretell to a nicety--to within  a minute--at what point in the heavens they may be found at any  future time, say, next month, next year, or even next century. They  can indeed predict transits and eclipses; but suppose astronomers  from New Zealand on their way to America to observe this fall's moon  eclipse, meet with an accident in mid-ocean, would they at once send  this wireless telegram to the United States' star-gazers assembled  say at Lick Observatory: \"Belated by leak. Please retard eclipse two  hours that we may not miss it.\" As well might all the telescopemen in  the world combined, attempt to fetch down the rings of Saturn for the  construction of a royal-race track as pretend to control movements of  the heavenly bodies.    The helpless babe of yesterday may indeed rival Mozart, Hayden and  Paderewski, but tomorrow he may rise with lame hands and pierced  ear-drums; and millions of worshipers of the shattered idol are  powerless to restore it to the musical world. Still Jesus healed the  blind, the deaf and the palsied, by a mere act of his will, even  without speaking a word.    \"We have this treasure in earthen vessels\" (II Cor. 4:7).    \"Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord whereas I am dust  and ashes\" (Genesis 18:27). \"In the morning man shall grow up like  grass and flourish, in the evening he shall fall, grow dry and wither\"  (Psalm 89:6). \"_Can man be compared with God_, even though he were  of perfect knowledge\" (Job 22:2). \"None is good but God alone\" (Luke  18:19). \"Of his greatness there is no end\" (Psalm 144: 3). \"All nations  are before him as if they had no being at all, and are counted to him  as nothing and vanity. To whom then have you likened God, or what image  will you make for him? It is he that sitteth upon the globe of the  earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as locusts: he that stretcheth  out the heavens as nothing, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell  in. All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of  the field. The grass is withered, and the flower is fallen because  the wind of the Lord had blown upon it. Indeed, the people is grass\"  (Isaiah 40:17, 18, 22, 6, 7). \"He that bringeth the searches of secrets  to nothing, that hath made the judges of the earth as vanity--hath  measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighed the heavens  with his palm? Who hath poised with three fingers the bulk of the  earth, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance\"  (Isaiah 40:23-12).    An Ingersoll might sneer and cry out: Surely Isaias had no idea of  the size of the earth. Even though he did not know that the globe is  such an immense ball, and that the volume of the sun is one million  two hundred thousand times greater than the earth, and three hundred  thousand times its weight, God who inspired the prophet knew infinitely  more about it than our conceited astronomers.    I fear Mr. B. H. Roberts will be inclined to think God jealous because  he gives man no show for comparison with him. This would certainly be  a less blunder of the Utah man (\"I will not give my glory to another\")  (Isaiah 42:8) than his contention, which is a mere echo of Satan's  promise in Paradise; \"You shall be as gods.\" (Genesis 3:5.)    Man is indeed capable of progress, but his forward movement is slow,  and in some matters his attainments remain stationary; for instance,  nothing has been added to philosophy since the days of Aristotle,  and nothing to geometry since Euclid. Both of these geniuses lived  over three hundred years before Christ. Conclude we, then, with the  Psalmist: \"All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee?\" (Psalm  34:10).    THE UNITY OF GOD.    1. The first chapter of the Bible reveals the supreme fact that there  is One Only and Living God, the Creator and moral Governor of the  universe. As Moses opened the sacred Writings by proclaiming him,  so the Jew in all subsequent generations, has continued to witness  for him, till from the household of Abraham, faith in the one only  living and true God has spread through Jerusalem, Christianity and  Mahometanism well-nigh over the earth.[A]    [Footnote A: \"Hours with the Bible,\" by Geikie, vol. 1, chapters 1, 2.]    Primeval revelations of God had everywhere become corrupted in the  days of Moses, save among the chosen people. Therefore, the first leaf  of the Mosaic record, as Jean Paul says, has more weight than all the  folios of men of science and philosophers.    While all nations over the earth have developed a religious tendency  which acknowledged a higher than human power in the universe, Israel is  the only one which has risen to the grandeur of conceiving this power  as the One Only Living God. If we are asked how it was that Abraham  possessed not only the primitive conception of the Divinity, as he had  revealed himself to all mankind, but passed through the denial of all  other gods, to the knowledge of the One God, we are content to answer,  that it was by a special _divine revelation_.[A]    [Footnote A: \"Chips from a German Workshop,\" by Max Muller, vol. 1, pp.  345-372.]    The record of this divine revelation is to be found in the Bible:  \"Hear, Israel: Our God is one Lord.\" \"I alone am, and there is no other  God besides me\" (Deut. 6:4 and 32:39). \"I am the first and I am the  last, and after me there shall be none\" (Isaiah 44:6; 43:10.) \"I will  not give my glory to another\" (Isaiah 42:8; 45:5, etc., etc.).    And as Mr. Roberts admits that our conception of God must be in harmony  with the New Testament, it as well as the Old witnesses continually  to One True God. Suffice it to quote: \"_One_ is good, _God_\" (Matthew  19:17;) \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\" (Luke 10:27); \"My Father of  whom you say that he is your God\" (John 8:54). Here Christ testified  that the Jews believed in only one God.    \"_The Lord is a God of all Knowledge_\" (I Kings 2). (\"Mormon\" Catechism  v. Q. 10 and Q. 11.)    \"Of that day and hour _no one knoweth_, no not the angels of heaven,  but _the Father alone_\" (Matthew 24:36).    _No one knoweth_ who the Son is _but the Father_ (Luke 10:22).    _Therefore, no one is God but one, the Heavenly Father._    In another form: The All-knowing alone is God. The Father alone is  all-knowing. Therefore the Father alone is God.[A]    [Footnote A: To the exclusion of another or separate divine being, but  not to the denial of the distinct Divine Personalities of the Son and  the Holy Ghost in the One Divine Being.]    From these clear statements of the Divine Book it is evident that all  the texts quoted by Mr. Roberts do not bear the inference he draws from  them; on the contrary, they directly make against him, plainly proving  the unity of God.    First, then, if God so emphatically declares, both in the Old and in  the New Testament, that there is but one God, has anyone the right to  contradict him and to say that there are several or many Gods? But Mr.  Roberts insists that the Bible contradicts the Bible; in other words,  that God, the author of the Bible, contradicts himself. To say such a  thing is downright blasphemy.    The liability to self-contradiction is characteristic of human frailty.  It is incompatible with God's infinite perfections. Therefore, I most  emphatically protest that there is no _real_ contradiction in the  Bible, though here and there may exist an _apparent_ one.    Let me premise that the name God, Elohim, is applied (1) to the one  true God; (2) to false gods and idols; (3) to"]]]
