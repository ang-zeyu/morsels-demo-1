There is no greater power,  above and beyond themselves, to regulate their actions. The enfranchised  classes in England do drop their fists into the balance, and, as a result,  we have seen the extensions of suffrage that marked the years 1832 and  1848, and the reason some classes are still unfranchised is, that the  monarchy that wills their unfranchisement has, as yet, more power at  command than those who would enfranchise them. Mental and moral force is  more respected with every rolling year, because those who respect it have  been able to obtain control of the physical power that can force its  decrees upon those who do not respect it.    The third count in the indictment is: \"Having deprived her of the first  right of a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without  representation in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all  sides.\" As, in securing the exact number of grievances mentioned by the  Fathers, the Mothers were compelled to string out their distresses  somewhat, I will quote the next count in the indictment, and consider  these two together. \"After depriving her of all rights as a married woman,  if single, and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a  government which recognized her only when her property could be made  profitable to it.\"    The many-sided oppression, and the deprivation as a married woman, belong  in other chapters. The remaining portions of the two counts may be summed  up under the familiar cry: \"No taxation without representation.\" What did  that just accusation mean when our fathers uttered it in regard to English  tyranny? Did they mean that their property was taxed, and they had no  redress? The phrase originated with Patrick Henry, who read to the  Virginia House of Burgesses the decision gleaned from a study of \"Coke  upon Lyttleton,\" that \"Englishmen living in America had all the rights of  Englishmen living in England, the chief of which was, that they could only  be taxed by their own representatives,\" and on that was founded the  resolution adopted by them that the colonies could not be lawfully taxed  in a body in which they were not represented; for the colonies, as well as  individuals, had no vote in Parliament. They meant that their property  could not be so taxed, and they meant far more. The more that they meant  was embodied by Jefferson in the first draft of the Declaration of  Independence, when he said: \"Can any one reason be assigned why a hundred  and sixty thousand _electors_ in the island of Great Britain should give  law to four million in the States of America?\" John Hancock meant that and  more when he said: \"Burn Boston and make John Hancock a beggar, if the  public good requires it.\" He was offering his taxed property to defend the  liberties of the four millions against the hundred and sixty thousand  electors. The refusal of the majority to be ruled longer by the minority  was the main motive of determination not to submit. But at that time all  voting was connected with a tax on property, and so was the suffrage  established by these men. And under those property-tax laws women who held  property could vote. It was when taxation ceased to go with  representation, that the women ceased to vote. There is now no connection  between taxation of property and representation. When people were allowed  votes in proportion to the amount of property they held, and could vote in  different counties and States, there was a connection, and that law gave  the rich man more voting power than the poor man. But all aristocratic  qualification was done away with, and the government came to rely solely  on the strength of individual men for its defence, instead of upon men and  women with money enough to raise soldiery. There is a money tax levied on  the property of men and women alike; and in return for the payment of this  tax the property of both men and women is made secure against unlawful  injury. In order to make it secure, the state lays, upon men alone, a  service tax, and with that tax goes representation, or the vote. This  service tax does not fall upon woman, and it cannot be demanded of her; so  it is not true that \"Man has taxed her to support a government which  recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.\" He  has, in return for the money tax, so guarded her property through the  service tax on men that it is of profit to her, which without that guard  it could not be.    The tax on property is collected from that of minors and unnaturalized  citizens, resident or non-resident, and to all these classes, as well as  to non-voting women, is given the right of petition and legal redress of  whatever sort. The men do not have \"equal rights\" in regard to public  control of their taxable property, if equal rights means that each man  shall be able to say what shall be done to, or with, or about, the  property on which he pays taxes. The penniless voter can have as much to  say as to whether a railroad shall cross the lands of a millionaire as the  millionaire himself. At every town election the minority are unheeded, so  far as the vote goes, and women with property interests would be no better  off if they secured votes in the only way they can be secured--one voice,  one vote.    Lydia Maria Child said, in a letter reprinted in the Woman's edition of  \"The Rochester Post-Express\" in 1896: \"I reduce the argument to very  simple elements. I pay taxes for property of my own earning and saving,  and I do not believe in taxation without representation. As for  representation by proxy, that savors too much of the plantation system,  however kind the master may be. I am a human being, and every human being  has a right to a voice in the laws which claim authority to tax him, to  imprison him, or to hang him.\"    Not only has every human being in the United States a right to a voice in  the laws that claim authority to tax him, imprison him, or hang him, but  he can exercise that right in all portions of the United States where the  laws that claim this authority are able to enlist sufficient physical  force to execute the authority claimed. Where they have not that power,  neither the voter nor the non-voter has any redress against violence  offered to property or limb or life. Gerrymanders and lynchings in many  parts of our land prove the truth of this. The mastery of men who abide by  and execute law is not a mastery over women for the sake of the spoils of  taxation or the disposal of life, but the mastery over lawlessness  everywhere in order that tax-payers of either sex, native or alien, voters  or non-voters, may be enabled to have that voice in the laws which, as  human beings, is their right. As to the \"vote by proxy,\" if Mrs. Child  could not trust her husband, her son, her brother, or best friend to look  after her interests, she certainly could not trust the carrying out of her  wish, as expressed in her vote, to the men who cast in their ballots by  her side.    In return for the taxes paid, women get just what men get, namely, roads,  gas, water, schools, etc. The women who have refused to pay their taxes  because they did not vote, have been treated with a leniency that proves  the courtesy of the law-enforcers. They would have made short work with  men who were non-voters, who had tried the same tactics. When a man's vote  is challenged and refused, he does not dream of saying: \"I shall not pay  my tax,\" and the assessor never inquires whether he votes or desires to  vote. The men in the District of Columbia do not find their unfranchised  condition assuaged by the smallness of their account with the assessor.  Neither do they realize or believe that they are governed without their  consent, or exempt from police or military duty. This is a striking proof  that the vote is not a reward for service. They are male American  citizens, over twenty-one years old, and they must contribute service  simply and solely for that reason. This is the price they pay for  established order.    For, after all, what is government, and what are taxation and  representation? When and how did society consent to be governed? When did  it agree to be taxed and to be represented? The awful story of history,  from the slaying of Abel to the slaughter of half a million men in the War  of Secession, is the answer. It never did agree, it has not yet agreed.  The struggle of civilization is the effort to make it agree. Implanted in  the bosom of man by his Maker is the belief in his individual freedom, of  worship as concerns that Maker, of protection as concerns man. Side by  side with that, was implanted the principle of surrender of a part of that  freedom for just cause. There came a time when men said: \"Let us use  arguments instead of force in these decisions,\" and some form of vote was  instituted. With this they fought and voted by turns, as they set up or  knocked down emperors, kings, popes, and presidents. War has been changed  by progress because man has changed; but main strength to drive home the  truths gained on the moral battlefield is still the power behind the  throne of the National conscience, even in this enlightened land.    Though the Mothers of the Rebellion did not ask, and apparently did not  think of asking, to share the military duties incident to suffrage, we  must discuss it, if we are to consider the subject thoroughly. To be a  voting citizen, is to be a possible soldier citizen. There is no way of  fulfilling the moral part of the duty, and leaving unfulfilled the  physical, and it is cowardly to attempt it. So the question comes, could  American women be soldiers? They could, for a few in disguise were in  service during the War of Secession. Titled women of Europe are honorary  officers; but this playing soldier is a relic of Middle-Age chivalry.

Listen--but first  show me the place where the gentlemen sleep.\"    The hotel-keeper led the way to the corridor, and pointed out the  sleeping apartments of the Harkaway party.    Petrus then held another short consultation with the two black men and  the hotel-keeper, the result of which was that the latter retired,  leaving Sunday, Monday, and Petrus to work their will with the invaders  when they appeared.    And then, as there was but little time to spare, they set to work with  a will to make all the necessary preparations.    Over each door they screwed into the wall an iron hook, to which was  attached a pulley and a cord.    Then they went into the lower regions and hunted through the store  rooms.    The first place they lighted upon was a kind of paint shop, full of  paints, oils and such-like things.    \"Dis is jes de shop for to cook de goose ob dem willins,\" said Sunday.    \"And here's de pots to cook 'em in,\" said Monday, pointing to some iron  vessels resembling pails, but made so that the bottoms could be  removed.    The pails, as we will call them, were something like sugar loaves, with  the tops cut off and turned base upwards.    When full, the weight of the liquid kept the bottom in its place, but  it was evident that if the bottom was removed, as it easily could be,  the contents would escape.    Petrus, after an inspection, pronounced them \"just the thing,\" adding--    \"Now we must fill them with tar.\"    \"No, no,\" said Monday. \"Put tar in one, wery hot; in nodder put dis  here paint, also werry hot; and in de oder put water, bilin' hot.\"    \"Good.\"    Then the three sat down by the large fireplace in the kitchen, and  deliberately began their cooking.    Monday devoted his attention to the heating of several pounds of mixed  paint.    Sunday boiled a barrel of tar, while Petrus attended to a large  cauldron of water.    Ten minutes before the hands of the clock pointed to half-past twelve,  all the cooks had completed their work.    The paint, tar, and water, all at boiling heat, had been placed in the  iron pails with the movable bottoms, and one of these had been hung  over each bedroom door.    The hot water over Harkaway's door, the paint over Harvey's, and the  tar over that in which the two boys and Jefferson reposed.    A string was attached to each pail, and passed over a pulley, the end  being conveyed to a recess where the three watchers were concealed.  They were armed.    Sunday, Monday, and Petrus each had a six-chambered revolver, loaded.    Then came the clang of the old-fashioned clock as it proclaimed  half-past twelve.    Breathless silence prevailed both inside the house and out.    \"Lights out,\" whispered Petrus, when, after a short pause, a slight  grating noise was heard at the back door.    In an instant all was darkness, except that the moon shone through a  narrow window at the extreme end of the corridor.    A few minutes afterwards Petrus, who was watching, saw three dark  figures come gliding into the long passage.    The first was a tall, bulky figure--Toro.    The second the Greek, and the third was evidently Hunston.    A plan of operations had been agreed upon--that was quite certain; for  Toro, without the least hesitation, proceeded to Jefferson's door, the  Greek placing himself outside Harvey's apartment, while Hunston  stationed himself at the room occupied by Harkaway.    Then they waited for a signal, evidently intending to rush in  simultaneously.    \"Now!\" said Hunston, in a loud whisper.    \"Now!\" echoed Petrus.    Before the brigands could rush into the rooms occupied by those they  sought to destroy, Petrus pulled the three strings he held in his hand,  and, good Heaven! what a spluttering and swearing at once commenced.    Hunston was drenched and scalded.    \"A million curses!\" he roared.    \"Help! Look here, Toro.\"    But Toro could not look.    A deluge of hot tar had streamed over his head, filling eyes, ears,  nose, and mouth, saturating his hair and running down inside his  clothing.    \"Furies!\" he screamed, \"I'll have the life of the villain who has done  this! Mathias, out with your knife, man.\"    But the poor Greek was utterly cowed; the paint had destroyed all his  senses save that of feeling, which was fully exercised.    Hunston, although severely scalded, managed to keep a certain  proportion of his wits about him.    \"Come, lads--quick, as you value your lives!\" he exclaimed. \"Away! we  must not risk capture.\"    He endeavoured to drag them away.    At that moment, however, another actor appeared on the scene.    This was Nero.    That wide-awake member of the monkey tribe had been doomed to share  Sunday's apartments, where a neat bed had been made for him in one  corner.    Hearing a noise, and, perhaps missing his companion (brother, Jefferson  said), he came down, carrying in his dexter paw a well-filled pillow.    He seemed to recognise Toro at once.    The valorous ape leaped forward, and gave his Italian foe such a  bolstering as Toro had never before heard of, while the three  spectators laughed and applauded loudly.    Crack!    The ticking of the pillow gave way, and a shower of feathers enveloped  the unhappy son of Italy, whose oaths and execrations were literally  smothered.    \"Golly! an't he a downy cove?\" said Monday.    At this juncture, Hunston managed to grasp his companions by the hand,  and dragged them downstairs and out at the back door.    Only just in time, however, for Jefferson, hearing the noise, rushed  out, in scanty costume, it is true, but fully armed with pistol and  bowie knife, and eager for the fray.    \"What is the matter?\" he demanded.    Petrus explained briefly.    Jefferson rushed to the door and fired two shots after the fugitives,  who, however, managed to get away.    Then the door was securely bolted, and after the affair had been  explained to all the alarmed inmates of the house, they retired to bed,  but not before Harkaway and his friends had shaken Petrus warmly by the  hand, with a promise that he should see his beloved daughter in the  morning.          CHAPTER IX.    THE BRIGAND'S CONSPIRACY--THE ARAB ASTROLOGER--HARVEY'S FIRST  APPEARANCE AS A MESMERIST.      \"They are making fresh efforts to get Mathias out,\" said Dick Harvey to  his friend Harkaway.    This was the beginning of a conversation which took place at the  residence of the Harkaway party just three days after the daring and  audacious attack on the hotel.    Mathias had been captured by the patrol while endeavouring to escape,  and thrown in gaol again.    \"Hang their impudence!\" said Jefferson. \"Will nothing daunt them? I  wish one of them had entered my room the other night; I would have held  him faster than it seems the prisons here can.\"    \"These two restless vagabonds are up to their games again,\" exclaimed  Dick.    \"You mean Toro?\"    \"Aye, and Hunston.\"    \"What have they done now?\" demanded Jefferson.    \"They have been trying to tamper with the gaolers.\"    \"How was it discovered?\"    \"The traitor, whoever he may be, let fall a letter that he was carrying  to Mathias.\"    \"That's lucky. Well, did they discover any thing?\"    \"No; it was written in cypher.\"    \"The cunning rascals!\"    \"Now, I've got more news for you,\" Dick went on to say.    \"Out with it, then.\"    \"You have heard of the Arab who tells fortunes in the town?\"    \"Mehemed Sadan, the great necromancer?\"    \"Yes. Would you be surprised to learn that he is one of Mathias' band?\"    \"Why, those scoundrels have a finger in every pie.\"    \"True,\" said Harvey. \"Now, I have a notion to offer you. I propose that  we go there and test the truth of what I say.\"    \"How?\"    \"I'll tell you that as we go. Are you agreed?\"    \"I'm willing,\" said Harkaway; \"any thing for a little excitement.\"    Off they went.    Mehemed Sadan, the Arabian magician, carried on his occult practices in  a house in the best part of the town, and all his surroundings tended  to show that the \"black art\" had proved a most profitable commerce to  him.    When Harkaway, Jefferson, and Harvey arrived there, they were ushered  into the presence of the magician by a negro fancifully attired,  wearing silver bands round his wrists and ankles, from which dangled  chains with small bells attached.    Mehemed Sadan was seated on a high-backed chair, close by a long table,  on which was a long cloth of black velvet, covered with mystic signs  and letters, which were all so much Greek to the visitors.    The room was filled with all kinds of things calculated to impress the  vulgar with superstitious awe.    The effect was altogether lost upon Dick Harvey, for he made a point of  nodding at the Arab astrologer in the most familiar manner.    \"Morning to you, old fellow,\" he said, cheerfully.    \"Salaam, sahib,\" responded the necromancer, gravely.    \"Hullo!\" said Jefferson, opening his eyes, \"why, this Arab talks  Hindustani.\"    \"Leave it to me,\" said Dick Harvey, in an undertone.    The Arab then said some few words to the company generally, which the  company generally could make rather less of than if they had been  addressed in Chinese.    \"He's talking no known language under the sun,\" said Harkaway. \"It's my  opinion he has got the cheek to talk regular right-down gibberish to  us.\"    It was true.    The words, or sounds, let us say, which the necromancer was uttering,  only sounded but too much like \"hokey-pokey kickeraboo abracadabra,\"  and the rest of the mysterious sounds with which the conjurer at  juvenile parties seeks to invest his performance with additional  wonder, for the benefit of his youthful audience.    Dick was in a rage.    \"Confound his impudence,\" he exclaimed; \"I'll give him one.\"    So he let out in this wise--    \"Chi ki"]]]
