But still I have found out that  strife has come into the river, and I know not whether ye two  will be able to get away; for they are in the river.\"    \"Who?\" says Hallvard.    \"Brothers twain,\" says Oliver; \"one's name is Vandil, and the  other's Karli, sons of Sjolf the Old, east away out of Gothland.\"    Hallvard told Gunnar that Oliver had added some ships to theirs,  and Gunnar was glad at that.  They busked them for their voyage  thence, till they were \"allboun.\"  Then Gunnar and Hallvard went  before Oliver, and thanked him; he bade them fare warily for the  sake of those brothers.      ENDNOTES:    (1)  A town at the mouth of the Christiania Firth.  It was a       great place for traffic in early times, and was long the       only mart in the south-east of Norway.        30. GUNNAR GOES A-SEA-ROVING    So Gunnar held on out of the river, and he and Kolskegg were both  on board one ship.  But Hallvard was on board another.  Now, they  see the ships before them, and then Gunnar spoke, and said, \"Let  us be ready for anything if they turn towards us!  but else let  us have nothing to do with them.\"    So they did that, and made all ready on board their ships.  The  others parted their ships asunder, and made a fareway between the  ships.  Gunnar fared straight on between the ships, but Vandil  caught up a grappling-iron, and cast it between their ships and  Gunnar's ship, and began at once to drag it towards him.    Oliver had given Gunnar a good sword; Gunnar now drew it, and had  not yet put on his helm.  He leapt at once on the forecastle of  Vandil's ship, and gave one man his death-blow.  Karli ran his  ship alongside the other side of Gunnar's ship, and hurled a  spear athwart the deck, and aimed at him about the waist.  Gunnar  sees this, and turned him about so quickly that no eye could  follow him, and caught the spear with his left hand, and hurled  it back at Karli's ship, and that man got his death who stood  before it.  Kolskegg snatched up a grapnel and cast it at Karli's  ship, and the fluke fell inside the hold, and went out through  one of the planks and in rushed the coal-blue sea, and all the  men sprang on board other ships.    Now Gunnar leapt back to his own ship, and then Hallvard came up,  and now a great battle arose.  They saw now that their leader was  unflinching, and every man did as well as he could.  Sometimes  Gunnar smote with the sword, and sometimes he hurled the spear,  and many a man had his bane at his hand.  Kolskegg backed him  well.  As for Karli, he hastened in a ship to his brother Vandil,  and thence they fought that day.  During the day Kolskegg took a  rest on Gunnar's ship, and Gunnar sees that.  Then he sung a  song --         \"For the eagle ravine-eager,       Raven of my race, to-day       Better surely hast thou catered,       Lord of gold, than for thyself;       Here the morn come greedy ravens       Many any a rill of wolf (1) to sup,       But thee burning thirst down-beareth,       Prince of battle's Parliament!\"    After that Kolskegg took a beaker full of mead, and drank it off,  and went on fighting afterwards; and so it came about that those  brothers sprang up on the ship of Vandil and his brother, and  Kolskegg went on one side, and Gunnar on the other.  Against  Gunnar came Vandil, and smote at once at him with his sword, and  the blow fell on his shield.  Gunnar gave the shield a twist as  the sword pierced it, and broke it short off at the hilt.  Then  Gunnar smote back at Vandil, and three swords seemed to be aloft,  and Vandil could not see how to shun the blow.  Then Gunnar cut  both his legs from under him, and at the same time Kolskegg ran  Karli through with a spear.  After that they took great war  spoil.    Thence they held on south to Denmark, and thence east to Smoland,  (2) and had victory wherever they went.  They did not come back  in autumn.  The next summer they held on to Reval, and fell in  there with sea-rovers, and fought at once, and won the fight.  After that they steered east to Osel,(3) and lay there somewhile  under a ness.  There they saw a man coming down from the ness  above them; Gunnar went on shore to meet the man, and they had a  talk.  Gunnar asked him his name, and he said it was Tofi.  Gunnar asked again what he wanted.    \"Thee I want to see,\" says the man.  \"Two warships lie on the  other side under the ness, and I will tell thee who command them:  two brothers are the captains -- one's name is Hallgrim, and the  other's Kolskegg.  I know them to be mighty men of war; and I  know too that they have such good weapons that the like are not  to be had.  Hallgrim has a bill which he had made by seething-  spells; and this is what the spells say, that no weapon shall  give him his death-blow save that bill.  That thing follows  it too that it is known at once when a man is to be slain with  that bill, for something sings in it so loudly that it may be  heard along way off -- such a strong nature has that bill in it.\"    Then Gunnar sang a song --         \"Soon shall I that spearhead seize,       And the bold sea-rover slay,       Him whose blows on headpiece ring,       Heaper up of piles of dead.       Then on Endil's courser (4) bounding,       O'er the sea-depths I will ride,       While the wretch who spells abuseth,       Life shall lose in Sigar's storm.\" (5)    \"Kolskegg has a short sword; that is also the best of weapons.  Force, too, they have -- a third more than ye.  They have also  much goods, and have stowed them away on land, and I know clearly  where they are.  But they have sent a spy-ship off the ness, and  they know all about you.  Now they are getting themselves ready  as fast as they can; and as soon as they are `boun,' they mean  to run out against you.  Now you have either to row away at once,  or to busk yourselves as quickly as ye can; but if ye win the day  then I will lead you to all their store of goods.\"    Gunnar gave him a golden finger-ring, and went afterwards to his  men and told them that war-ships lay on the other side of the  ness, \"and they know all about us; so let us take to our arms and  busk us well, for now there is gain to be got.\"    Then they busked them; and just when they were `boun' they see  ships coming up to them.  And now a fight sprung up between them,  and they fought long, and many men fell.  Gunnar slew many a man.  Hallgrim and his men leapt on board Gunnar's ship.  Gunnar turns  to meet him, and Hallgrim thrust at him with his bill.  There was  a boom athwart the ship, and Gunnar leapt nimbly back over it.  Gunnar's shield was just before the boom, and Hallgrim thrust his  bill into it, and through it, and so on into the boom.  Gunnar  cut at Hallgrim's arm hard, and lamed the forearm, but the sword  would not bite.  Then down fell the bill, and Gunnar seized the  bill, and thrust Hallgrim through, and then sang a song --         \"Slain is he who spoiled the people,       Lashing them with flashing steel;       Heard have I how Hallgrim's magic       Helm-rod forged in foreign land;       All men know, of heart-strings doughty,       How this bill hath come to me,       Deft in fight, the wolf's dear feeder,       Death alone us two shall part.\"    And that vow Gunnar kept, in that he bore the bill while he  lived.  Those namesakes the two Kolskeggs fought together, and  it was a near thing which would get the better of it.  Then  Gunnar came up, and gave the other Kolskegg his death-blow.  After that the sea-rovers begged for mercy.  Gunnar let them have  that choice, and he let them also count the slain, and take the  goods which the dead men owned, but he gave the others whom he  spared their arms and their clothing, and bade them be off to the  lands that fostered them.  So they went off, and Gunnar took all  the goods that were left behind.    Tofi came to Gunner after the battle, and offered to lead him to  that store of goods which the sea-rovers had stowed away, and  said that it was both better and larger than that which they had  already got.    Gunnar said he was willing to go, and so he went ashore, and Tofi  before him, to a wood, and Gunnar behind him.  They came to a  place where a great heap of wood was piled together.  Tofi says  the goods were under there, then they tossed off the wood, and  found under it both gold and silver, clothes, and good weapons.  They bore those goods to the ships, and Gunnar asks Tofi in what  way he wished him to repay him.    Tofi answered, \"I am a Dansk man by race, and I wish thou wouldst  bring me to my kinsfolk.\"    Gunnar asks why he was there away east?    \"I was taken by sea-rovers,\" says Tofi, \"and they put me on land  here in Osel, and here I have been ever since.\"      ENDNOTES:    (1)  Rill of wolf -- stream of blood.

GUNNAR GOES TO KING HAROLD GORM'S SON AND EARL HACON    Gunnar took Tofi on board, and said to Kolskegg and Hallvard,  \"Now we will hold our course for the north lands.\"    They were well pleased at that, and bade him have his way.  So  Gunnar sailed from the east with much goods.  He had ten ships,  and ran in with them to Heidarby in Denmark.  King Harold Gorm's  son was there up the country, and he was told about Gunnar, and  how too that there was no man his match in all Iceland.  He sent  men "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],[0,"Vanity Fair (#11)"],[1,"had fled into the  inmost cavern with Prince Ahmed: the Roc had whisked away Sindbad the  Sailor out of the Valley of Diamonds out of sight, far into the clouds:  and there was everyday life before honest William; and a big boy  beating a little one without cause.    \"Hold out your other hand, sir,\" roars Cuff to his little schoolfellow,  whose face was distorted with pain. Dobbin quivered, and gathered  himself up in his narrow old clothes.    \"Take that, you little devil!\" cried Mr. Cuff, and down came the wicket  again on the child's hand.--Don't be horrified, ladies, every boy at a  public school has done it. Your children will so do and be done by, in  all probability.  Down came the wicket again; and Dobbin started up.    I can't tell what his motive was.  Torture in a public school is as  much licensed as the knout in Russia.  It would be ungentlemanlike (in  a manner) to resist it. Perhaps Dobbin's foolish soul revolted against  that exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a hankering feeling of  revenge in his mind, and longed to measure himself against that  splendid bully and tyrant, who had all the glory, pride, pomp,  circumstance, banners flying, drums beating, guards saluting, in the  place.  Whatever may have been his incentive, however, up he sprang,  and screamed out, \"Hold off, Cuff; don't bully that child any more; or  I'll--\"    \"Or you'll what?\" Cuff asked in amazement at this interruption. \"Hold  out your hand, you little beast.\"    \"I'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life,\" Dobbin  said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's sentence; and little  Osborne, gasping and in tears, looked up with wonder and incredulity at  seeing this amazing champion put up suddenly to defend him: while  Cuff's astonishment was scarcely less.  Fancy our late monarch George  III when he heard of the revolt of the North American colonies: fancy  brazen Goliath when little David stepped forward and claimed a meeting;  and you have the feelings of Mr. Reginald Cuff when this rencontre was  proposed to him.    \"After school,\" says he, of course; after a pause and a look, as much  as to say, \"Make your will, and communicate your last wishes to your  friends between this time and that.\"    \"As you please,\" Dobbin said.  \"You must be my bottle holder, Osborne.\"    \"Well, if you like,\" little Osborne replied; for you see his papa kept  a carriage, and he was rather ashamed of his champion.    Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to say, \"Go  it, Figs\"; and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for  the first two or three rounds of this famous combat; at the  commencement of which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on  his face, and as light and as gay as if he was at a ball, planted his  blows upon his adversary, and floored that unlucky champion three times  running.  At each fall there was a cheer; and everybody was anxious to  have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.    \"What a licking I shall get when it's over,\" young Osborne thought,  picking up his man.  \"You'd best give in,\" he said to Dobbin; \"it's  only a thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it.\" But Figs, all  whose limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage,  put his little bottle-holder aside, and went in for a fourth time.    As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed  at himself, and Cuff had begun the attack on the three preceding  occasions, without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now  determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own  part; and accordingly, being a left-handed man, brought that arm into  action, and hit out a couple of times with all his might--once at Mr.  Cuff's left eye, and once on his beautiful Roman nose.    Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly. \"Well  hit, by Jove,\" says little Osborne, with the air of a connoisseur,  clapping his man on the back. \"Give it him with the left, Figs my boy.\"    Figs's left made terrific play during all the rest of the combat. Cuff  went down every time.  At the sixth round, there were almost as many  fellows shouting out, \"Go it, Figs,\" as there were youths exclaiming,  \"Go it, Cuff.\" At the twelfth round the latter champion was all abroad,  as the saying is, and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack  or defence.  Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker.  His face  being quite pale, his eyes shining open, and a great cut on his  underlip bleeding profusely, gave this young fellow a fierce and  ghastly air, which perhaps struck terror into many spectators.  Nevertheless, his intrepid adversary prepared to close for the  thirteenth time.    If I had the pen of a Napier, or a Bell's Life, I should like to  describe this combat properly.  It was the last charge of the  Guard--(that is, it would have been, only Waterloo had not yet taken  place)--it was Ney's column breasting the hill of La Haye Sainte,  bristling with ten thousand bayonets, and crowned with twenty  eagles--it was the shout of the beef-eating British, as leaping down  the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in the savage arms of battle--in  other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck, but quite reeling and  groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's  nose, and sent him down for the last time.    \"I think that will do for him,\" Figs said, as his opponent dropped as  neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the  pocket at billiards; and the fact is, when time was called, Mr.  Reginald Cuff was not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.    And now all the boys set up such a shout for Figs as would have made  you think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle;  and as absolutely brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to  know the cause of the uproar.  He threatened to flog Figs violently, of  course; but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing  his wounds, stood up and said, \"It's my fault, sir--not Figs'--not  Dobbin's.  I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.\" By  which magnanimous speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping,  but got back all his ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had  nearly cost him.    Young Osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction.      Sugarcane House, Richmond, March, 18--    DEAR MAMA,--I hope you are quite well.  I should be much obliged to you  to send me a cake and five shillings. There has been a fight here  between Cuff & Dobbin. Cuff, you know, was the Cock of the School.  They fought thirteen rounds, and Dobbin Licked.  So Cuff is now Only  Second Cock.  The fight was about me.  Cuff was licking me for breaking  a bottle of milk, and Figs wouldn't stand it.  We call him Figs because  his father is a Grocer--Figs & Rudge, Thames St., City--I think as he  fought for me you ought to buy your Tea & Sugar at his father's.  Cuff  goes home every Saturday, but can't this, because he has 2 Black Eyes.  He has a white Pony to come and fetch him, and a groom in livery on a  bay mare.  I wish my Papa would let me have a Pony, and I am    Your dutiful Son, GEORGE SEDLEY OSBORNE    P.S.--Give my love to little Emmy.  I am cutting her out a Coach in  cardboard.  Please not a seed-cake, but a plum-cake.      In consequence of Dobbin's victory, his character rose prodigiously in  the estimation of all his schoolfellows, and the name of Figs, which  had been a byword of reproach, became as respectable and popular a  nickname as any other in use in the school.  \"After all, it's not his  fault that his father's a grocer,\" George Osborne said, who, though a  little chap, had a very high popularity among the Swishtail youth; and  his opinion was received with great applause. It was voted low to sneer  at Dobbin about this accident of birth. \"Old Figs\" grew to be a name of  kindness and endearment; and the sneak of an usher jeered at him no  longer.    And Dobbin's spirit rose with his altered circumstances. He made  wonderful advances in scholastic learning.  The superb Cuff himself, at  whose condescension Dobbin could only blush and wonder, helped him on  with his Latin verses; \"coached\" him in play-hours: carried him  triumphantly out of the little-boy class into the middle-sized form;  and even there got a fair place for him.  It was discovered, that  although dull at classical learning, at mathematics he was uncommonly  quick.  To the contentment of all he passed third in algebra, and got a  French prize-book at the public Midsummer examination. You should have  seen his mother's face when Telemaque (that delicious romance) was  presented to him by the Doctor in the face of the whole school and the  parents and company, with an inscription to Gulielmo Dobbin.  All the  boys clapped hands in token of applause and sympathy.  His blushes, his  stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as  he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate? Old Dobbin,  his father, who now respected him for the first time, gave him two  guineas publicly; most of which he spent in a general tuck-out for the  school: and he came back in a tail-coat after the holidays.    Dobbin was much too modest a young fellow to suppose that this happy  change in all his circumstances arose from his own generous and manly  disposition: he chose, from some perverseness, to attribute his good  fortune to the sole agency and benevolence of little George Osborne, to  whom henceforth he vowed such a love and affection as is only felt by  children--such an affection, as we read in the charming fairy-book,  uncouth Orson had for splendid young Valentine his conqueror.  He flung  himself down at little Osborne's feet, and loved him. Even before they  were acquainted, he had admired Osborne in secret.  Now he was his  valet, his dog, his man Friday.  He believed Osborne to be the "]]]
