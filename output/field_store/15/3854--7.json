Will you answer a question?\"    \"Ask!\"    \"You say my father--my real father--is living?\"    The veiled lady bowed her head.    \"Where is he?\"    \"That I cannot say, but he is looking for you.\"    \"He is in search of me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why has he delayed it so long?\"    \"There are circumstances which I cannot explain which have prevented his  seeking and claiming you.\"    \"Will he do so?\"    \"I have told you that he is now seeking for you. I think he will find  you at last.\"    \"What can I do to bring this about?\"    \"Do nothing! Stay where you are. Circumstances are working favorably,  but you must wait. There are some drawbacks.\"    \"What are they?\"    \"You have two enemies, or rather one, for the other does not count.\"    \"Is that enemy a man?\"    \"No, it is a woman.\"    \"My step-mother!\" ejaculated Phil, with immediate conviction.    \"You have guessed aright.\"    \"And who is the other?\"    \"A boy.\"    \"Jonas?\"    \"It is the son of the woman whom you call your step-mother.\"    \"What harm can they do me? I am not afraid of them,\" said Phil, raising  his head proudly.    \"Do not be too confident! The meanest are capable of harm. Mrs. Brent  does not like you because she is a mother.\"    \"She fears that I will interfere with her son.\"    \"You are all right.\"    \"Is there anything more you can tell me?\" asked Phil. \"Have I any other  enemies?\"    \"Yes; there are two more--also a woman and her son.\"    \"That puzzles me. I can think of no one.\"    \"They live in the city.\"    \"I know. It is Mrs. Pitkin, my employer's wife. Why should she dislike  me?\"    \"There is an old man who likes you. That is the cause.\"    \"I see. She doesn't want him to be kind to any one out of the family.\"    \"That is all I have to tell you,\" said the fortune-teller abruptly. \"You  can go.\"    \"You have told me strange things,\" said Phil. \"Will you tell me how it  is you know so much about a stranger?\"    \"I have nothing more to tell you. You can go!\" said the veiled lady  impatiently.    \"At least tell me how much I am to pay you.\"    \"Nothing.\"    \"But I thought you received fees.\"    \"Not from you.\"    \"Did you not take something from my friend who was in here before me?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You told him a good fortune.\"    \"He is a fool!\" said the fortune-teller contemptuously. \"I saw what he  wanted and predicted it.\"    She waved her hand, and Phil felt that he had no excuse for remaining  longer.    He left the room slowly, and found Mr. Wilbur anxiously awaiting him.    \"What did she tell you, Phil?\" he asked eagerly. \"Did she tell you what  sort of a wife you would have?\"    \"No. I didn't ask her,\" answered Phil, smiling.    \"I should think you'd want to know. What did she tell you, then?\"    \"She told me quite a number of things about my past life and the events  of my childhood.\"    \"I shouldn't have cared about that,\" said Wilbur, shrugging his  shoulders. \"Why, I know all about that myself. What I want to know about  is, whether I am to marry the girl I adore.\"    \"But you see, Wilbur, I don't adore anybody. I am not in love as you  are.\"    \"Of course that makes a difference,\" said Wilbur. \"I'm glad I came,  Phil. Ain't you?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Phil slowly.    \"You see, it's such a satisfaction to know that all is coming right  at last. I am to marry HER, you know, and although it isn't till I am  twenty-four----\"    \"She will be nearly thirty by that time,\" said Phil slyly.    \"She won't look it!\" said Mr. Wilbur, wincing a little. \"When I am  thirty I shall be worth twenty thousand dollars.\"    \"You can't save it very soon out of six dollars a week.\"    \"That is true. I feel sure I shall be raised soon. Did the  fortune-teller say anything about your getting rich?\"    \"No. I can't remember that she did. Oh, yes! she said I would make my  fortune, but not in the way I expected.\"    \"That is queer!\" said Mr. Wilbur, interested. \"What could she mean?\"    \"I suppose she meant that I would not save a competence out of five  dollars a week.\"    \"Maybe so.\"    \"I have been thinking, Wilbur, you have an advantage over the young lady  you are to marry. You know that you are to marry her, but she doesn't  know who is to be her husband.\"    \"That is true,\" said Wilbur seriously. \"If I can find out her name, I  will write her an anonymous letter, asking her to call on the veiled  Lady.\"        CHAPTER XVI.    MRS. BRENT'S STRANGE TEMPTATION.    Now that Phil is fairly established in the city, circumstances require  us to go back to the country town which he had once called home.    Mrs. Brent is sitting, engaged with her needle, in the same room where  she had made the important revelation to Phil.    Jonas entered the house, stamping the snow from his boots.    \"Is supper most ready, mother?\" he asked.    \"No, Jonas; it is only four o'clock,\" replied Mrs. Brent.    \"I'm as hungry as a bear. I guess it's the skating.\"    \"I wish you would go to the post-office before supper, Jonas. There  might be a letter.\"    \"Do you expect to hear from Phil?\"    \"He said nothing about writing,\" said Mrs. Brent indifferently. \"He will  do as he pleases about it.\"    \"I did'nt know but he would be writing for money,\" chuckled Jonas.    \"If he did, I would send him some,\" said Mrs. Brent.    \"You would!\" repeated Jonas, looking at his mother in surprise.    \"Yes, I would send him a dollar or two, so that people needn't talk. It  is always best to avoid gossip.\"    \"Are you expecting a letter from anybody, mother?\" asked Jonas, after a  pause.    \"I dreamed last night I should receive an important letter,\" said Mrs.  Brent.    \"With money in it?\" asked Jonas eagerly.    \"I don't know.\"    \"If any such letter comes, will you give me some of the money?\"    \"If you bring me a letter containing money,\" said Mrs. Brent, \"I will  give you a dollar.\"    \"Enough said!\" exclaimed Jonas, who was fond of money; \"I'm off to the  post-office at once.\"    Mrs. Brent let the work fall into her lap and looked intently before  her. A flush appeared on her pale face, and she showed signs of  restlessness.    \"It is strange,\" she said to herself, \"how I have allowed myself to be  affected by that dream. I am not superstitious, but I cannot get over  the idea that a letter will reach me to-night, and that it will have  an important bearing upon my life. I have a feeling, too, that it will  relate to the boy Philip.\"    She rose from her seat and began to move about the room. It was a  relief to her in the restless state of her mind. She went to the window  to look for Jonas, and her excitement rose as she saw him approaching.  When he saw his mother looking from the window, he held aloft a letter.    \"The letter has come,\" she said, her heart beating faster than its wont.  \"It is an important letter. How slow Jonas is.\"    And she was inclined to be vexed at the deliberation with which her son  was advancing toward the house.    But he came at last.    \"Well, mother, I've got a letter--a letter from Philadelphia,\" he said.  \"It isn't from Phil, for I know his writing.\"    \"Give it to me, Jonas,\" said his mother, outwardly calm, but inwardly  excited.    \"Do you know any one in Philadelphia, mother?\"    \"No.\"    She cut open the envelope and withdrew the inclosed sheet.    \"Is there any money in it?\" asked Jonas eagerly.    \"No.\"    \"Just my luck!\" said Jonas sullenly.    \"Wait a minute,\" said his mother. \"If the letter is really important,  I'll give you twenty-five cents.\"    She read the letter, and her manner soon showed that she was deeply  interested.    We will look over her shoulders and read it with her:      \"CONTINENTAL HOTEL, PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 5.    \"DEAR MADAM:--    \"I write to you on a matter of the greatest importance to my happiness,  and shall most anxiously await your reply. I would come to you in  person, but am laid up with an attack of rheumatism, and my physician  forbids me to travel.    \"You are, as I have been informed, the widow of Gerald Brent, who  thirteen years since kept a small hotel in the small village of  Fultonville, in Ohio. At that date I one day registered myself as his  guest. I was not alone. My only son, then a boy of three, accompanied  me. My wife was dead, and my affections centered upon this child.  Yet the next morning I left him under the charge of yourself and your  husband, and pursued my journey. From that day to this I have not seen  the boy, nor have I written to you or Mr. Brent. This seems strange,  does it not? It requires an explanation, and that explanation I am ready  to give.    \"To be brief, then, I was fleeing from undeserved suspicion.  Circumstances which I need not detail had connected my name with the  mysterious disappearance of a near friend, and the fact that a trifling  dispute between us had taken place in the presence of witnesses had  strengthened their suspicions. Knowing myself to be innocent, but  unable to prove it, I fled, taking my child with me. When I reached  Fultonville, I became alive to the ease with which I might be traced,  through the child's companionship. There was no resource but to leave  him. Your husband and yourself impressed me as kind and warm-hearted.  I was specially impressed by the gentleness with which you treated my  little Philip, and I felt that to you I could safely trust him. I did  not, however, dare to confide my secret to any one. I simply said I  would leave the boy with you till he should recover from his temporary  indisposition, and then, with outward calmness but inward anguish, I  left my darling, knowing not if I should ever see him again.    \"Well, time passed. I went to Nevada, changed my name, invested the  slender sum I had with me in mining, and, after varying fortune, made  a large fortune at last. But better fortune still awaited me. In a poor  mining hut, two months since, I came across a man who confessed that he  was guilty of the murder of which I had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46202"],[0,"A New Witness for God (Volume 1 of 3) (#11)"],[1,"they will scarcely be saved. Of the  rest, some followed the one or the other of the preceding; some fled,  others were taken, and of these some held out as far as the prison and  bonds, and some after a few days' imprisonment abjured Christianity  before they entered the tribunal. And some, also, after enduring  the torture for a time, at last renounced. Others, however, firm  and blessed pillars of the Lord, confirmed by the Lord himself, and  receiving in themselves strength and power, suited and proportioned to  their faith, became admirable witnesses of his kingdom.\" [12]    Eusebius at great length recounts the suffering of individuals both  in the east and west divisions of the empire, but it is not necessary  to follow him through all those details. It will be sufficient to say  that this persecution was more terrible than any which preceded it.  It extended over the whole empire, and had for its avowed object the  enforced apostasy of the Christians. [13]    How unrelenting the efforts must have been to encompass either the  destruction or the apostasy of the Christians will appear when it is  known that the governors of the provinces were \"commanded, on pain  of forfeiting their own lives, either to exterminate all Christians  utterly, or bring them back by pain and tortures to the religion  of their fathers.\" \"During two years,\" continues Mosheim, \"a great  multitude of Christians in all the Roman provinces were cut off by  various species of punishment and suffering. This persecution was more  cruel and terrific than any that preceded it; and immense numbers  dismayed, not so much by the fear of death, as by the dread of the  long-continued tortures by which the magistrates endeavored to overcome  the constancy of the Christians, professed to renounce Christ; and  procured for themselves safety, either by sacrificing, i. e., offering  incense before the idols, or by certificates purchased with money.\" [14]    Gibbon, who never admits the severity of the persecutions under the  emperors, except when compelled by undeniable facts, says, of this  one under Decius: \"The fall of Philip (the predecessor of Decius)  introduced with a change of masters, a new system of government so  oppressive to the Christians that their former condition, ever since  the time of Domitian, was represented as a state of perfect freedom  and security, if compared with the rigorous treatment which they  experienced under the short reign of Decius. * * * The bishops of the  most considerable cities were removed by exile or death; the vigilance  of the magistrates prevented the clergy of Rome during sixteen months  from proceeding to the new election; and it was the opinion of the  Christians that the emperor would more patiently endure a competition  for the purple than a bishop for the capital.\" [15]    Milner, quoting Cyprian, says concerning the effect of this  persecution: \"Vast numbers lapsed into idolatry immediately. Even  before men were accused as Christian many ran to the forum and  sacrificed to the gods as they were ordered; and the crowds of  apostates were so great that the magistrates wished to delay numbers  of them till the next day, but they were importuned by the wretched  suppliants to be allowed to prove themselves heathens that very night.\"  [16]    The reign of Decius was brief, lasting only two years, and toward the  close of it, as if surfeited with slaughter, the violent persecution  against the saints relaxed somewhat of its severity; but his  successors, Gallus and his son Volusian, renewed it. A pestilential  disease broke out about this time and spread through a number of the  provinces, and this the pagan priests persuaded the populace was a  curse sent upon the people on account of the toleration shown to the  Christians. This was sufficient to re-kindle the flames of hatred and  for two years more the Church of Christ suffered violence as it had  done under Decius.    There remains but one more persecution to notice, that which is  commonly known as the Diocletian. It could be called more properly the  Galerian persecution; for Galerius, son-in-law to the emperor, and one  with two others--Constantius Chlorus and Maximian--who shared with  him the responsibility of governing the empire, [17] had most to do  with it. It is said that Galerius was urged to secure the edicts of  Diocletian against the Christians by his mother, Romlia, a very haughty  woman, who had taken offense because the saints had excluded her from  their sacrament meetings. Be that as it may, it is generally conceded  that this severest of all persecutions against the Church of Christ was  inaugurated and carried on through the hatred and influence of Galerius.    According to Eusebius [18] the persecution began in the nineteenth  year of the reign of Diocletian--303 A. D. The emperor in issuing his  first edict could not be brought to the infamy of aiming at the lives  of the saints; it appears he could only be brought to that by degrees.  His first edict ordered the destruction of the Christian churches, and  the surrender of the holy scriptures and the degradation of Christians  from office. Shortly after this the royal palace at Nicomedia was twice  set on fire, and from it Galerius fled, giving out that he feared  Christian malice had attempted his life. The Christians being charged  with the crime the incident was made the excuse for issuing a second  edict, \"in consequence of which whole families of the pious were slain  at the imperial command, some with the sword, some also with fire. But  the populace, binding another number upon planks, threw them into the  depths of the sea.\" [19]    A rebellion which occurred in Syria about this time was also charged  to Christian intrigue, and a third edict was issued commanding that  the heads of the church everywhere should be thrust into prison. \"The  spectacle of affairs after these events exceeds all description.  Innumerable multitudes were imprisoned in every place, and the  dungeons formerly destined for murderers and the vilest criminals  were then filled with bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, readers  and exorcists, so that there was no room left for those condemned for  crimes.\" [20] It was ordered after a time that the prisoners should be  granted their liberty on condition that they offer sacrifice at the  shrine of the heathen gods. To effect that purpose the judges were  commanded to employ the most excruciating tortures.    Diocletian thought to destroy the Christian \"superstition\" by  overcoming the constancy of the leaders; but meeting with more  resistance than he anticipated, he at last issued a fourth edict,  directing the magistrates to compel all Christians, irrespective of  age, sex, or official position, to offer sacrifice to the gods; and  to employ tortures to compel that apostasy. The magistrates yielded  strict obedience to the edict of the emperor, and the Christian church  was reduced to the last extremity. [21] The scenes of suffering from  tortures and bloodsheds throughout the empire, except in Gaul, where  Constantine reigned, defy description. \"Thousands, both men, and women  and children,\" says Eusebius, speaking of those who suffered in Egypt,  \"despising the present life for the sake of our Savior's doctrine,  submitted to death in various shapes. Some, after being tortured with  scrappings [22] and the rack, and the most dreadful scourgings, and  other innumerable agonies which one might shudder to hear, were finally  committed to the flames; and some plunged and drowned in the sea,  others voluntarily offering their own heads to their executioners,  others dying in the midst of their torments, some wasted away by  famine, and others again fixed to the cross. Some, indeed, were  executed as malefactors usually were; others, more cruelly, were nailed  with the head downwards, and kept alive until they were destroyed by  starving on the cross itself.\" [23]    After describing similar but still more cruel tortures endured by the  Christians of Thebais, Eusebius continues: \"And all these things were  doing not only for a few days or some time but for a series of whole  years. At one time ten or more, at another more than twenty, at another  time not less than thirty, and even sixty, and again at another time,  a hundred men with their wives and little children were slain in one  day, whilst they were condemned to various and varied punishments. We  ourselves have observed when on the spot, many crowded together in  one day suffering decapitation, some the torments of the flames; so  that the murderous weapon was completely blunted, and having lost its  edge, broke to pieces; and the executioners themselves wearied with the  slaughter, were obliged to relieve one another.\" [24]    Gibbon, whose very reluctance to concede the severity of these  persecutions induces me to quote him as often as admissions are forced  from his unwilling lips, says of this persecution: \"The magistrates  were commanded to employ every method of severity which might reclaim  them from their odious superstition, and obliged them to return to the  established worship of the gods. This rigorous order was extended, by a  subsequent edict, to the whole body of Christians, who were exposed to  a violent and general persecution. Instead of those salutary restraints  which had required the direct and solemn testimony of an accuser,  it became the duty as well as the interest of the imperial officer  to discover, to pursue, and to torment the most obnoxious among the  faithful. Heavy penalties were denounced against all who should presume  to save a prescribed sectary from the just indignation of the gods and  the emperors.\" [25]    This persecution lasted for ten years; and at the end of that time the  church presented a melancholy spectacle. Everywhere, even in Gaul, the  Christian houses of worship were laid in ruins. Streams of Christian  blood had flowed in every"]]]
