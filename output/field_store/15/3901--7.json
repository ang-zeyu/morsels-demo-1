Sleep in peace, Don Luis  que su audacia y su prudencia           his audacity and prudence  nada lograrán de mí,                    will never succeed with me,  que tengo cifrada en ti                 for I've settled on you, you see,  la gloria de mi existencia.             the glory of my existence.

CIUTTI: Señor, por mi vida, que es      My word, in truth your  vuestra suerte buena y mucha.           luck is good and plentiful.    DON JUAN: Ciutti, nadie como yo:        Ciutti, there's no one like me:  ya viste cuán fácilmente                you saw how easily  el buen alcaide prudente                the good and wise constabulary  se avino y suelta me dio.               came to terms, and set me free.  Mas no hay ya en ello que hablar:       But there's no need to talk of that.  ¿mis encargos has cumplido?             Have you done what I said?    CIUTTI: Todos los he concluido          I have done it all  mejor que pude esperar.                 better than I could have hoped.    DON JUAN: ¿La beata...?                 The governess?    CIUTTI: Esta es la llave                This is the key  de la puerta del jardín,                to the gate in the garden wall,  que habrá que escalar al fin,           that you'd have had to climb,                                          and it's tall,  pues, como usarced ya sabe,             since, as you're able to see,  las tapias de ese convento              the walls of that particular convent  no tienen entrada alguna.               have no other entrance at all.    DON JUAN: ¿Y te dio carta?              And did she give you a letter?    CIUTTI: Ninguna;                        No, none,  me dijo que aquí al momento             she told me that in a moment  iba a salir de camino;                  she was coming out for a walk:  que al convento se volvía               and she'd return to the convent  y que con vos hablaría.                 after the two of you talk.    DON JUAN: Mejor es.                     That's even better.    CIUTTI: Lo mismo opino.                 I thought so.    DON JUAN: ¿Y los caballos?              And the horses?    CIUTTI: Con silla                       I have them bridled  y freno los tengo ya.                   and ready.    DON JUAN: ¿Y la gente?                  And my men?    CIUTTI: Cerca está.                     Are nearby.    DON JUAN:  Bien, Ciutti; mientras Sevilla          Good Ciutti; while Seville  tranquila en sueño reposa               reposes in tranquil sleep  creyéndome encarcelado,                 believing me imprisoned  otros dos nombres añado                 another two names will be added  a mi lista numerosa.                    to the long list I keep.  ¡Ja!, ¡ja!                              Ha ha!    CIUTTI: Señor.                          Sir.    DON JUAN: ¿Qué?                         What?    CIUTTI: Callad.                         Be quiet.    DON JUAN: ¿Qué hay, Ciutti?             What's wrong Ciutti?    CIUTTI: Al doblar la esquina,           On turning the corner  en esa reja vecina                      at the neighbouring window  he visto un hombre.                     I saw a man.    DON JUAN: Es verdad:                    Its true:  pues ahora sí que es mejor              so now the affair is  el lance: ¿y si es ése?                 going better. Could it be him?    CIUTTI: ¿Quién?                         Who?    DON JUAN: Don Luis.                     Don Luis.    CIUTTI: Imposible.                      Impossible.    DON JUAN: ¡Toma!                        Why?  ¿No estoy yo aquí?                      Well, am I not here?    CIUTTI: Diferencia                      There's a big difference  va de él a vos.                         between you and him.    DON JUAN: Evidencia                     I believe the evidence, man,  lo creo Ciutti; allí asoma              Ciutti; there is still  tras de la reja una dama.               a lady behind the grill.    CIUTTI: Una criada tal vez.             Perhaps a servant.    DON JUAN:  Preciso es verlo, ¡pardiez!,            By heaven! I want  no perdamos lance y fama.               to see,  not lose the game or the fame.  Mira, Ciutti: a fuer de ronda,          Look, Ciutti, play at being the                                          night patrol,  tú con varios de los míos               with several of my men  por esa calle escurríos                 scatter through that street, again,  dando vuelta a la redonda               and set up around the whole  a la casa.                              house.    CIUTTI: Y en tal caso                   In that case  cerrará ella.                           she'll close the window.    DON JUAN: Pues con eso,                 And in that way,  ella ignorante y él preso,              him a prisoner, her unaware,  nos dejarán franco el paso.             the way will be clear for us                                          there.    CIUTTI: Decís bien.                     That's right.    DON JUAN: Corre y atájale,              Run and overtake him  que en ello el vencer consiste.         For winning depends on it.    CIUTTI: ¿Mas si el truhán se            But if the scoundrel resists?  resiste?    DON JUAN:  Entonces de un tajo, rájale.            Then with one sword-stroke                                          break him.

NEXT, to a graver tribe we turn our view,  And yield the praise to worth and science due,  But this with serious words and sober style,  For these are friends with whom we seldom smile.  Helpers of men they're call'd, and we confess  Theirs the deep study, theirs the lucky guess;  We own that numbers join with care and skill,  A temperate judgment, a devoted will:  Men who suppress their feelings, but who feel  The painful symptoms they delight to heal;  Patient in all their trials, they sustain  The starts of passion, the reproach of pain;  With hearts affected, but with looks serene,  Intent they wait through all the solemn scene;  Glad if a hope should rise from nature's strife,  To aid their skill and save the lingering life;  But this must virtue's generous effort be,  And spring from nobler motives than a fee:  To the Physician of the Soul, and these,  Turn the distress'd for safety, hope, and ease.     But as physicians of that nobler kind  Have their warm zealots, and their sectaries blind;  So among these for knowledge most renowned,  Are dreamers strange, and stubborn bigots found:  Some, too, admitted to this honourd name,  Have, without learning, found a way to fame;  And some by learning--young physicians write,  To set their merit in the fairest light;  With them a treatise in a bait that draws  Approving voices--'tis to gain applause,  And to exalt them in the public view,  More than a life of worthy toil could do.  When 'tis proposed to make the man renown'd,  In every age, convenient doubts abound;  Convenient themes in every period start,  Which he may treat with all the pomp of art;  Curious conjectures he may always make,  And either side of dubious questions take;  He may a system broach, or, if he please,  Start new opinions of an old disease:  Or may some simple in the woodland trace,  And be its patron, till it runs its race;  As rustic damsels from their woods are won,  And live in splendour till their race be run;  It weighs not much on what their powers be shown,  When all his purpose is to make them known.     To show the world what long experience gains,  Requires not courage, though it calls for pains;  But at life's outset to inform mankind  Is a bold effort of a valiant mind.     The great, good man, for noblest cause displays  What many labours taught, and many days;  These sound instruction from experience give,  The others show us how they mean to live.  That they have genius, and they hope mankind  Will to its efforts be no longer blind.     There are, beside, whom powerful friends advance,  Whom fashion favours, person, patrons, chance:  And merit sighs to see a fortune made  By daring rashness or by dull parade.     But these are trifling evils; there is one  Which walks uncheck'd, and triumphs in the sun:  There was a time, when we beheld the Quack,  On public stage, the licensed trade attack;  He made his laboured speech with poor parade,  And then a laughing zany lent him aid:  Smiling we pass'd him, but we felt the while  Pity so much, that soon we ceased to smile;  Assured that fluent speech and flow'ry vest  Disguised the troubles of a man distress'd; -     But now our Quacks are gamesters, and they play  With craft and skill to ruin and betray;  With monstrous promise they delude the mind,  And thrive on all that tortures human-kind.     Void of all honour, avaricious, rash,  The daring tribe compound their boasted trash -  Tincture of syrup, lotion, drop, or pill;  All tempt the sick to trust the lying bill;  And twenty names of cobblers turn'd to squires,  Aid the bold language of these blushless liars.  There are among them those who cannot read,  And yet they'll buy a patent, and succeed;  Will dare to promise dying sufferers aid,  For who, when dead, can threaten or upbraid?  With cruel avarice still they recommend  More draughts, more syrup, to the journey's end:  \"I feel it not;\"--\"Then take it every hour:\"  \"It makes me worse;\"--\"Why then it shows its power;\"  \"I fear to die;\"--\"Let not your spirits sink,  You're always safe, while you believe and drink.\"     How strange to add, in this nefarious trade,  That men of parts are dupes by dunces made:  That creatures, nature meant should clean our streets,  Have purchased lands and mansions, parks and seats:  Wretches with conscience so obtuse, they leave  Their untaught sons their parents to deceive;  And when they're laid upon their dying bed,  No thought of murder comes into their head,  Nor one revengeful ghost to them appears,  To fill the soul with penitential fears.     Yet not the whole of this imposing train  Their gardens, seats, and carriages obtain:  Chiefly, indeed, they to the robbers fall,  Who are most fitted to disgrace them all;  But there is hazard--patents must be bought,  Venders and puffers for the poison sought;  And then in many a paper through the year,  Must cures and cases, oaths and proofs appear;  Men snatch'd from graves, as they were dropping in,  Their lungs cough'd up, their bones pierced through their skin  Their liver all one schirrus, and the frame  Poison'd with evils which they dare not name;  Men who spent all upon physicians' fees,  Who never slept, nor had a moment's ease,  Are now as roaches sound, and all as brisk as bees,     If the sick gudgeons to the bait attend,  And come in shoals, the angler gains his end:  But should the advertising cash be spent,  Ere yet the town has due attention lent,  Then bursts the bubble, and the hungry cheat  Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat;  It is a lottery, and he shares perhaps  The rich man's feast, or begs the pauper's scraps.     From powerful causes spring th' empiric's gains,  Man's love of life, his weakness, and his pains;  These first induce him the vile trash to try,  Then lend his name, that other men may buy:  This love of life, which in our nature rules,  To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools;  Then pain compels th' impatient soul to seize  On promised hopes of instantaneous ease;  And weakness too with every wish complies,  Worn out and won by importunities.     Troubled with something in your bile or blood,  You think your doctor does you little good;  And grown impatient, you require in haste  The nervous cordial, nor dislike the taste;  It comforts, heals, and strengthens; nay, you think  It makes you better every time you drink;  \"Then lend your name \"you're loth, but yet confess  Its powers are great, and so you acquiesce:  Yet think a moment, ere your name you lend,  With whose 'tis placed, and what you recommend;  Who tipples brandy will some comfort feel,  But will he to the med'cine set his seal?  Wait, and you'll find the cordial you admire  Has added fuel to your fever's fire:  Say, should a robber chance your purse to spare,  Would you the honour of the man declare?  Would you assist his purpose? swell his crime?  Besides, he might not spare a second time.     Compassion sometimes sets the fatal sign,  The man was poor, and humbly begg'd a line;  Else how should noble names and titles back  The spreading praise of some advent'rous quack?  But he the moment watches, and entreats  Your honour's name,--your honour joins the cheats;  You judged the med'cine harmless, and you lent  What help you could, and with the best intent;  But can it please you, thus to league with all  Whom he can beg or bribe to swell the scrawl?  Would you these wrappers with your name adorn  Which hold the poison for the yet unborn?     No class escapes them--from the poor man's pay,  The nostrum takes no trifling part away:  See! those square patent bottles from the shop,  Now decoration to the cupboard's top;  And there a favourite hoard you'll find within,  Companions meet! the julep and the gin.     Time too with cash is wasted; 'tis the fate  Of real helpers to be call'd too late;  This find the sick, when (time and patience gone)  Death with a tenfold terror hurries on.     Suppose the case surpasses human skill,  There comes a quack to flatter weakness still;  What greater evil can a flatterer do,  Than from himself to take the sufferer's view?  To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers,  And rob a sinner of his dying hours?  Yet this they dare, and craving to the last,  In hope's strong bondage hold their victim fast:  For soul"]]]
