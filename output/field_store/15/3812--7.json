The bottle should be kept  tightly corked, and a little of the preparation rubbed well into the  hair-roots daily. If it create any irritation after two or three days'  use, it is best to wash the scalp with a little warm water and soap.  The pomade which has been recommended may be afterwards employed for  two or three days till the irritation has subsided, when the  application may be renewed. A better plan still is, from the first, to  use the hair restorer on one day, and the pomade on the next,  alternately. This foregoing application is of course not infallible,  but it will be found to do more good in a greater number of cases than  any known preparation.      THE NAILS      From the fact that the nails are in reality appendages of the skin,  they are naturally entitled to some brief consideration. Beneath the  nail is the matrix, that part of the true skin from which the nail is  formed. The matrix has not a perfectly smooth surface, but is arranged  in 8 scries of parallel ridges with alternating grooves. The nail is of  a rosy pink colour, because it is transparent enough to let the blood,  circulating beneath, be seen through it. Near the root is a little  crescentric-shaped white portion called the lunula. The growth of the  nail takes place from below. It cannot grow backwards, since it is  confined in a groove. But as the fresh cells form they gradually thrust  the whole nail forward, till at last it requires paring. As a matter of  fact, however, the nails really require more attention than they  usually receive. The finger nails should be trimmed into a bow shape,  and the corners rounded off, while the skin near the root of the nail,  which tends to grow over the lunula, should be repressed into position  by means of any suitable appliance. On the contrary, those of the feet  should be cut squarish in shape, with a hollowed-out centre, so as to  prevent the nail from ingrowing.      THE TEETH      It is not my purpose to enter fully into all the details concerning the  teeth, but there are one or two matters of great importance connected  with them which require a few words. There are many people, beginning  to get on in years, perhaps, who have had the misfortune to lose many  of their teeth. The first thing that happens is an inability to  masticate their food; and, before long, indigestion sets in, with all  the evils attendant on its train. These unfortunates know that they  have indigestion; the pain and discomfort after food tell them that.  They do not know, however, that all their sufferings arise solely from  their want of teeth. They begin to lose flesh, and get altogether in a  bad way. But if they can be induced to apply to a competent and skilful  dental surgeon, they are properly fitted with what they require, and  the consequence is their sufferings almost immediately cease. They  begin to enjoy their food, and before long their whole appearance is  transformed into one of health. In the opinion of all dental  authorities, when the natural teeth are lost, artificial substitutes  unquestionably conduce to health and comfort.    It is quite deplorable to see what little interest people take  in the preservation of their teeth; even those who should know better  are in too many instances quite as neglectful. But the teeth play a  very important part in the thorough division of food, and if this be  not ensured the health is bound to suffer. They should be kept  scrupulously clean, therefore, and the formation of tartar prevented.    These two objects are best accomplished by their thorough cleansing  with a moderately stiff brush. Too soft a brush is insufficient for the  purposes of removing the accumulations which collect upon the teeth. A  tooth-powder or dentifrice of some kind will also be required. One of  the simplest, and possibly also one of the very best, is composed of  the following:    Powdered borax                1/2 an ounce.  Powdered orris root           1 ounce.  Powdered white Castile soap   1/4 of an ounce.  Precipitated chalk            3 ounces.  Oil of cloves                 2 drops.  Oil of winter green           1/2 an ounce.    This leaves nothing to be desired, and will be found satisfactory in  every respect.    It is customary to dip the tooth-brush into water, so as the better to  enable it to take up the dentifrice. But it will be found an advantage  if, after dipping the brush into water, it then be rubbed once or twice  over a piece of white Castile soap. It will by this means pick up a  larger amount of the powder. The teeth should be attended to after each  meal, although cleansing them the last thing at night is an important  duty, never on any account to be neglected. It must not be imagined,  however, that even the foregoing is sufficient. Particles of food,  which the brush fails to remove, collect between the teeth, and, if  allowed to remain, ultimately lead on to decay. This is most likely to  occur when the teeth are crowded close together in the jaw. But  under all circumstances, whether the teeth be closely set together, or  whether they be more widely apart, a piece of floss silk should be  passed between them daily, so as to remove any adherent particles, and  at the same time to thoroughly cleanse the sides of the teeth.          CHAPTER IV.        BEDROOM VENTILATION      Now, if all houses were built in accordance with the requirements of  modern sanitary ideas, there would be but little difficulty in  grappling with the problem of bedroom ventilation, for the sleeping  apartment would be a well ventilated room, with all the latest  contrivances, such as Tobin's ventilators, for the admission of fresh  air. But as the greater number of people have to live in rented  dwellings in which the rooms are very small, it becomes necessary to  know what can be done to remedy existing defects. In the first place  the bedroom should always be upstairs if possible; it is decidedly  healthier, and there is a better chance for the supply of fresh air.  The very worst room in the house that could be chosen for a sleeping  apartment would be one on the basement. Then again, a fireplace in the  bedroom is a priceless boon, and it is almost impossible to rectify  such a deficiency. But as too many rooms are built without it, we are  compelled to look to the window for our air supply. It is estimated  that nearly one-third of every person's life is devoted to sleep; that  is to say, about one-third of it is spent in the sleeping apartment. It  is only natural, then, that this room and its surroundings should merit  some special attention. As a matter of fact, from a health point of  view, it should receive more consideration than all the rest of the  house put together, for during our waking hours; we are moving about  and constantly changing our location; but during sleep, when life is in  abeyance to a certain extent, the system has passively to receive and  be supported by whatever pure air the bedroom happens to  possess. If, as too often is the case, that chamber is looked upon as a  sort of cupboard, where, amongst other things, there is room for a bed,  so much the worse for any one who has to sleep there. If the sleeper  arises in the morning in a dazed and semi-suffocated state and quite  unfitted for the day's work before him, instead of feeling refreshed,  there is no occasion to seek far for the cause. For the mental toiler,  also, it is equally important that the period devoted to the  restoration of brain material and the imbibition of a fresh supply of  nerve power for the ensuing day's requirements should be passed under  circumstances the most favourable for bestowing them.    From this we see that a due amount of sleep, under favourable  circumstances as regards ventilation, is necessary both for brain and  muscle; and that, in fact, unless it be forthcoming, there will be an  inability for either brain worker or muscle user to properly fulfil his  duties next day. But in addition to this there is still the fact that  we have to do with the semi-tropical climate of Australia. It will be  as well, therefore, to make reference to what has been said on the  subject as far as India is concerned. Sir Joseph Fayrer, whose opinion  on such matters must always carry respect, in the course of an address  on the preservation of health in that country, went on to say: \"It is  very important that you have good sleep, for nothing in the hot weather  more refreshes or invigorates you. Early rising is the rule in India,  and I advise you to conform to the usual practice.\"    Sir James Ranald Martin, another authority on Indian affairs, in  commenting on the prevention of disease, also calls attention to the  need for extra sleep, which is always required in hot climates. He  points out that by giving the frame a thorough and complete rest from  the great stimulus of heat, both tone and vigour are imparted--  providing for the requirements of the coming day, as well as repairing  those of the preceding. The general truths contained in the foregoing  apply equally to Australia, and during the hot summer months,  therefore, it must not be forgotten that an extra allowance of sleep is  quite indispensable.    In a great many cases the space under the bed is regarded as an  admirable receptacle for a collection of boxes, parcels, hat-boxes, old  boots, and other interesting relics, while they are effectually  concealed from view by a species of curtain reaching from the bed to  the floor. The drapery which thus hangs down is dignified by the name  of a \"valance,\" and though originally intended for the purpose of  embellishment and ornamentation, it is better that decorative art  should be more limited in its application, so as not to interfere with  the free circulation of air throughout the room. The sleeping apartment  is also considered as being particularly well adapted for the storage  of old clothes, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42238"],[0,"The Articles of Faith (#11)"],[1,"they should be preserved in unity,[87] \"that they  all may be one\" as the Father and the Son are one. It is absurd to  think that Christ desired His followers to lose their individuality  and become one person, even if a change so directly opposed to the  laws of nature were possible. Christ desired that all should be united  in heart, and spirit, and purpose; for such is the unity between His  Father and Himself, and between themselves and the Holy Ghost.      [84] See Note 11.      [85] John x, 30, 38; xvii, 11, 22.      [86] III Nephi xi, 27, 36; xxviii, 10; see also Alma xi, 44.      [87] John xvii, 11-21.    =22.= This unity is a type of completeness; the mind of any one member  of the Trinity is the mind of the others; seeing as each of them does  with the eye of purity and perfection, they see and understand alike;  under similar conditions and circumstances each would act in the same  way, guided by the same principles of unerring justice and equity. The  one-ness of the Godhead, to which the scriptures so abundantly  testify, implies no mystical union of substance, nor any unnatural and  therefore impossible blending of personality; Father, Son, and Holy  Ghost are as distinct in their persons and individualities as are any  three personages in the flesh. Yet their unity of purpose and  operation is such as to make their edicts one, and their will the will  of God. To see one is to see all; therefore said Christ when  importuned by Philip to show them the Father: \"Have I been so long  time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath  seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the  Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in  me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the  Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am  in the Father, and the Father in me.\"[88]      [88] John xiv, 9-11.    =23. Personality of Each Member of the Godhead.=--From the evidence  already presented, it is clear that the Father is a personal Being,  possessing a definite form, with bodily parts, and spiritual passions.  Jesus Christ, who was with the Father[89] in spirit before coming to  dwell in the flesh, and through whom the worlds were made,[90] lived  among men as a man, with all the physical characteristics of a human  being; after His resurrection He appeared in the same form;[91] in  that form He ascended into heaven;[92] and in that form He has  manifested Himself to the Nephites, and to modern prophets. Now we are  assured that Christ was in the express image of His Father,[93] after  which image man also has been created.[94] Therefore we know that both  the Father and the Son are in form and stature perfect men; each of  them possesses a tangible body, infinitely pure and perfect, and  attended by transcendent glory, yet a body of flesh and bones.[95]      [89] John xvii, 5.      [90] John i, 3; Heb. i, 2; Eph. iii, 9; Col. i, 16.      [91] John xx, 14-15, 19-20, 26-27; xxi, 1-14; Matt, xxviii, 9;    Luke xxiv, 15-31, 36-44.      [92] Acts i, 9-11.      [93] Heb. i, 3; Col. i, 15; II Cor. iv, 4.      [94] Genesis i, 26-27; James iii, 8-9.      [95] Doc. and Cov. cxxx, 22.    =24.= The Holy Ghost, called also Spirit, and Spirit of the Lord,[96]  Spirit of God,[97] Comforter,[98] and Spirit of Truth,[99] is not  tabernacled in a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of  spirit;[100] yet we know that the Spirit has manifested Himself in  the form of a man.[101] It is by the ministrations of the Spirit that  the Father and the Son operate in their dealings with mankind;[102]  through Him knowledge is communicated,[103] and by Him the purposes of  the Godhead are achieved.[104] The Holy Ghost is the witness of the  Father and the Son,[105] declaring to man their attributes, bearing  record of the other personages of the Godhead.[106]      [96] I Nephi iv, 6; xi, 8; Mos. xiii, 5.

[106] For a fuller treatment of the Holy Ghost, His personality    and attributes, see Lecture viii, p. 162.    =25. Some of the Divine Attributes.=--_God is Omnipresent_: There is  no part of creation, however remote, into which He cannot penetrate;  through the medium of the Spirit the Godhead is in direct  communication with all things at all times. It has been said,  therefore, that God is everywhere present at the same time; but it is  unreasonable to suppose that the actual person of any one member of  the Godhead can be in more than one place at one time. The senses of  God are of infinite power, His mind of unlimited capacity; His eye can  penetrate all space, His ear can comprehend every sound; His powers of  transferring Himself from place to place are not limited; plainly,  however, His person cannot be in more than one place at any one time.  Admitting the personality of God, we are compelled to accept the fact  of His materiality; indeed, an \"immaterial being,\" under which  meaningless name some have sought to designate the condition of God,  cannot exist, for the very expression is a contradiction in terms. If  God possesses a form, that form is of necessity of definite  proportions and therefore of limited extension in space. It is  therefore impossible for Him to occupy at one time more than one space  of such limits; and it is not surprising therefore to learn from the  scriptures that He moves from place to place. Thus we read in  connection with the account of the Tower of Babel, \"And the Lord came  down to see the city and the tower.\"[107] Again, God appeared to  Abraham, and having declared Himself to be \"the Almighty God,\" He  talked with the patriarch, and established a covenant with him; then  we read \"And He left off talking with him, and God went up from  Abraham.\"[108]      [107] Gen. xi, 5.      [108] Gen. xvii, 1, 22.    =26.= _God is Omniscient._--By Him matter has been organized and  energy directed. He is therefore the Creator of all things that are  created; and \"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of  the world.\"[109] His power and His wisdom are alike incomprehensible  to man, for they are infinite. Being Himself eternal and perfect, His  knowledge cannot be otherwise than infinite. To comprehend Himself, an  infinite Being, He must possess an infinite mind. Through the agency  of angels and ministering servants, He is in continuous communication  with all parts of creation, and may personally visit as He may  determine.      [109] Acts xv, 18; see also Pearl of Great Price: Moses i, 6, 35;    I Nephi ix, 6.    =27.= _God is Omnipotent._--He is properly called the Almighty. Man  can discern proofs of the Divine omnipotence on every side, in the  forces that control the elements of earth, and that guide the orbs of  heaven in their prescribed courses; all are working together for the  common good. There can be no limits to the powers of God; whatever His  wisdom indicates as fit to be done He can and will do. The means  through which He operates may not be of infinite capacity in  themselves; but they are directed by an infinite power. A rational  conception of His omnipotence is power to do all that He may will to  do.    =28.= _God is kind_, _benevolent_, _and loving_, tender, considerate,  and long-suffering, bearing patiently with the frailties of His  wayward children. He is just, yet merciful in judgment,[110] showing  favor to all alike, and yet combining with these gentler qualities a  firmness, almost amounting to fierceness, in avenging wrongs.[111] He  is jealous[112] of His own power and the reverence paid to Him by His  children; that is to say, He is zealous for the principles of truth  and purity, which are nowhere exemplified in a higher degree than in  His personal attributes. This Being is the Author of our existence,  Him we are permitted to approach as Father. Our faith will increase in  Him as we learn of Him.[113]      [110] Deut. iv, 31; II Chron. xxx, 9; Exo. xxxiv, 6; Neh. ix, 17,    31; Psalms cxvi, 5; ciii, 8; lxxxvi, 15; Jer. xxxii, 18; Exo. xx,    6.      [111] Exo. xx, 5; Deut. vii, 21; x, 17; Psa. vii, 11.      [112] Exo. xx, 5; xxxiv, 14; Deut. iv, 24; vi, 14, 15; Josh. xxiv,    19, 20.      [113] See Note 12.    =29. Idolatry and Atheism.=--From the abundant evidence of the  existence of Deity, the idea of which is so generally held by the  human family, there would seem to be little ground on which man could  rationally assert and maintain a disbelief in God; and in view of the  many proofs of the benignant nature of the Divine attributes and  disposition, there ought to be little tendency to turn aside after  false and unworthy objects of worship. Yet the history of the race  shows that theism, which is the doctrine of belief in and acceptance  of, God as the rightful Ruler, is opposed by many varieties of  atheism;[114] and that man is prone to belie his boast as a creature  of reason, and to render his worship at idolatrous shrines. Atheism is  probably a development of later times, whilst idolatry asserted itself  as one of the early sins of the race. Even at the time of Israel's  exodus from Egypt, God deemed it proper to command by statute, \"Thou  shalt have no other gods before me;\"[115] yet even while He wrote  those words on the stony tablets, His people were bowing before the  golden calf which they had fashioned after the pattern of the Egyptian  idol.
