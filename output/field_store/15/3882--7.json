No eye dared see me but thine;  To thee alone might I wake!            [_Both remain full of beaming ecstasy, lost in          mutual contemplation._    BRÜNNHILDE        O Siegfried! Siegfried!      Hero most blest!      Of life the awaker,      Conquering light!      O joy of the world, couldst know      How thou wert always loved!      Thou wert my gladness,      My care wert thou!      Thy life I sheltered      Before it was thine;      My shield was thy shelter      Ere thou wert born:  So long loved wert thou, Siegfried!    SIEGFRIED [_Softly and timidly._    My mother did not die, then?  Did the dear one but sleep?    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Smiles and stretches her hand out kindly towards          him._        Adorable child!  Nevermore thy mother will greet thee!      Thyself am I,  If I be blest with thy love.      All things I know      Known not to thee;      Yet only of my love  Born is my wisdom.        O Siegfried! Siegfried!      Conquering light!      I loved thee always,      For I alone  Divined the thought hid by Wotan:      Hidden thought I dared not      So much as utter;      Thought that I thought not,      Feeling it only;      For which I worked,      Battled and strove,      Defying even      Him who conceived it;      For which in penance      Prisoned I lay,      Because thought it was not,      But felt alone!      For what the thought was--      Say, canst thou guess it?--  Was love of thee, nothing but that!    SIEGFRIED        How wondrous sounds      Thy rapturous song!  But dark the meaning to me.            [_Tenderly._        Of thine eyes the splendour      I see plain,      I can feel thee breathing      Soft and warm,      Sweet can hear      The singing of thy voice,  But what thou sayest I strive  Vainly to understand.      I cannot grasp clearly      Things so far distant;      Needed is every sense  To feel and behold thee!      By laming fear      Fettered am I,      For how to fear      Thou hast taught me at last;      Thou who hast bound me      In bonds of such power,  Give me my courage again!            [_He remains in great excitement with his yearning          gaze fixed on her._    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Turns her head gently aside and looks towards the          wood._        I see there Grane,      My sacred horse;      In gladness he grazes      Who slept with me!  He too has by Siegfried been waked.    SIEGFRIED            [_Without changing his position._        My gaze on a mouth      Most lovely is feasting;      My lips are afire      With passionate yearning  For the pasture sweet that I look on!    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Points to her armour, which she now perceives._        I see there the shield      That sheltered heroes;      And there is the helmet      That hid my head:  It shields, it hides me no more!    SIEGFRIED [_With fire._        By a glorious maid      My heart has been hurt      Wounds in my head      A woman has struck:  I came without shield or helm!    BRÜNNHILDE [_With increased sadness._        I see there the breastplate's      Glittering steel;      A keen-edged sword      Sundered the rings,      From the form of the maiden      Loosened the mail:  Nor shelter nor shield is left  To the weak and sorrowful maid!    SIEGFRIED [_With heat._        Through billows of fire      I battled to thee,      No buckler or breastplate      Sheltered or screened;      The flames have won      Their way to my heart;      My blood hot-surging      Rushes and leaps;      A ravening fire      Is kindled within me:      The flames that shone      Round Brünnhilde's rock  Are burning now in my breast!  O maid, extinguish the fire!  Calm the commotion and rage!            [_He has embraced her passionately._    BRÜNNHILDE            [_Springs up, resists him with the utmost strength          of terror, and flies to the other side of the          stage._    No God's touch have I known!      With awe the heroes      Greeted the maiden:  Holy came she from Walhall.      Woe's me! Woe's me!      Woe the affront,      The bitter disgrace!      He wounds me sore      Who waked me from sleep!  He has broken breastplate and helm;  Now I am Brünnhild' no more.    SIEGFRIED        Thou art to me      The dreaming maid still;      Brünnhilde lies      Lapped still in sleep.  Awake, be a woman to me!    BRÜNNHILDE [_Bewildered._        Confused are my senses,      My mind is blank:  Wisdom, dost thou forsake me?    SIEGFRIED        Said not thy song      Thy wisdom drew  Its light from thy love of me?    BRÜNNHILDE [_Staring before her._        Shadows drear-falling      Darken my gaze;      Mine eyes see dimly,      The light dies out,      Deep is the dark.      From dread-haunted mists      Fear in a frenzy      Comes writhing forth;      Terror stalks me      And grows with each stride!            [_She hides her eyes with her hands in violent          terror._    SIEGFRIED            [_Gently removing her hands from her eyes._        Dread lies dark      On eyelids bound;      With the fetters vanish  The fear and gloom;  Rise from the dark and behold:  Bright as the sun is the day.    BRÜNNHILDE [_Much agitated._        Flaunting my shame,  Bright as the sun shines the day!      O Siegfried! Siegfried!      Pity my woe!      I have always      Lived and shall live--      Always in sweet,      Rapturous yearning,  And always to make thee blest!        O Siegfried! Glorious      Wealth of the world!      Laughing hero!      Life of the earth!      Ah, forbear!      Leave me in peace!      Touch me not,      Mad with delirious frenzy!      Break me not,      Bring me not under thy yoke,  Undo not the loved one so dear!        Hast thou rejoiced      Thyself to see  Reflected clear in the stream?      If into wavelets      The water were stirred,      And ruffled the limpid      Calm of the brook,  Thy face would not be there,  Only water's rippling unrest.      So untouched let me stay,      Trouble me not,      And thy face      Mirrored bright in me      Will smile to thee always,  Gay and merry and glad!      O Siegfried,      Radiant child,      Love thyself      And leave me in peace;  O bring not thine own to naught!    SIEGFRIED        I love thee;      Didst thou but love me!      Myself I have lost;  Ah, would thou wert won!      A fair-flowing flood      Before me rolls;      With all my senses      Nothing I see  But buoyant, beautiful billows.      If it refuse      To mirror my face,      Just as I am,      To assuage my fever,      Myself I will plunge      Straight in the stream:--      If only the billows      Would blissfully drown me,  My yearning lost in the flood!      Awaken, Brünnhilde!      Waken, O maid!      Laughing and living,      Sweetest delight,  Be mine! Be mine! Be mine!    BRÜNNHILDE [_With deep feeling._        Thine, Siegfried!      I was from of old!    SIEGFRIED [_With fire._        What thou hast been      That be thou still!    BRÜNNHILDE        Thine I will      Always be!    SIEGFRIED        What thou wilt be      Be thou to-day!      Clasped in my arms      And closely embraced,      Heart upon heart      Beating in rapture,      Glances aglow,      And breath mingled hungrily,      Eye in eye and      Mouth on mouth!      All that thou wert  And wilt be, be thou it now!  The fear and the fever would vanish  Were Brünnhild' now mine!    BRÜNNHILDE        Were I now thine?        Heavenly calm      Is tossing and raging;      Light that was pure      Flames into passion;      Wisdom divine      Forsakes me and flies;      Jubilant love      Has scared it away!        If I be thine?      Siegfried! Siegfried!      Canst thou not see?      By the blaze of my eyes      Thou art not struck blind?      In my arms' embrace      Thou surely must burn!      As my blood like a torrent      Surges and leaps,      The fire fierce-flaming      Dost thou not feel?      Fearest thou, Siegfried?      Fearest thou not  The wild, love-frenzied maid?    SIEGFRIED [_With a shock of joy._        Ha!  As the blood swift-surging is kindled,  As our eyes devour one another,  As our arms cling close in their rapture,      Dauntless again      My courage swells,      And the fear I failed      For so long to learn,      The fear that I scarcely      Learned from thee--      The stupid boy fears  That fear is completely forgot!            [_With the last words he has involuntarily let          Brünnhilde go._    BRÜNNHILDE [_Laughing wildly with joy._        Oh, valorous boy!      Oh, glorious hero!      Unwitting source      Of wonderful deeds!  Laughing, laughing I love thee;  Laughing welcome my blindness;  Laughing let us go doomwards,  Laughing go down to death!        Farewell Walhall's      Radiant world,      Its stately halls      In the dust laid low!      Farewell, glittering      Pomp divine!      End in bliss,      O immortal race!      Norns, rend in sunder      Your rope of runes!      Dusk steal darkly      Over the Gods!      Night of their downfall      Dimly descend!      Now Siegfried's star      Is rising for me;      He is for ever      And for aye,      My wealth, my world,      My all in all:      Love ever radiant,      Laughing death!    SIEGFRIED            [_While Brünnhilde repeats the foregoing, beginning          at \"Farewell Walhall's Radiant world.\"_        Laughing thou wakest,      Thou my delight!      Brünnhilde lives,      Brünnhilde laughs!      Hail, O day      In glory arisen!      Hail, O Sun      That shines from on high!      Hail, O light      From the darkness sprung!      Hail, O world      Where Brünnhilde dwells!      She wakes! She lives!      She greets me with laughter!      Splendour streams      From Brünnhilde's star!

Half-way to the exit archway he was doing forty; he hit the  steeply-banked curve leading into the lofty \"street\" at ninety. Nor was  there shock or strain. Motorcycle-wise, but automatically, the \"Dilly\"  leaned against its gyroscopes at precisely the correct angle; the huge  low-pressure tires clung to the resilient synthetic of the pavement  as though integral with it. Nor was there any question of conflicting  traffic, for this thoroughfare, six full levels above Varick Street  proper, was not, strictly speaking, a street at all. It had only one  point of access, the one which Samms had used; and only one exit--it  was simply and only a feeder into Wright Skyway, a limited-access  superhighway.    Samms saw, without noting particularly, the maze of traffic-ways of  which this feeder was only one tiny part; a maze which extended from  ground-level up to a point well above even the towering buildings of  New York's metropolitan district.    The way rose sharply; Samms' right foot went down a little farther;  the Dillingham began to pick up speed. Moving loud-speakers sang to  him and yelled and blared at him, but he did not hear them. Brilliant  signs, flashing and flaring all the colors of the spectrum--sheer  triumphs of the electrician's art--blazed in or flamed into arresting  words and eye-catching pictures, but he did not see them.  Advertising--designed by experts to sell everything from aardvarks to  Martian zyzmol (\"bottled ecstacy\")--but the First Lensman was a seasoned  big-city dweller. His mind had long since become a perfect filter,  admitting to his consciousness only things which he wanted to perceive:  only so can big-city life be made endurable.    Approaching the Skyway, he cut in his touring roadlights, slowed down  a trifle, and insinuated his low-flyer into the stream of traffic.  Those lights threw fifteen hundred watts apiece, but there was no  glare--polarized lenses and wind-shields saw to that.    He wormed his way over to the left-hand, high-speed lane and opened  up. At the edge of the skyscraper district, where Wright Skyway angles  sharply downward to ground level, Samms' attention was caught and  held by something off to his right--a blue-white, whistling something  that hurtled upward into the air. As it ascended it slowed down; its  monotone shriek became lower and lower in pitch; its light went down  through the spectrum toward the red. Finally it exploded, with an  earth-shaking crash; but the lightning-like flash of the detonation,  instead of vanishing almost instantaneously, settled itself upon a  low-hanging artificial cloud and became a picture and four words--two  bearded faces and \"SMITH BROS. COUGH DROPS\"!    \"Well, I'll be damned!\" Samms spoke aloud, chagrined at having been  compelled to listen to and to look at an advertisement. \"I thought I  had seen everything, but _that_ is really new!\"    Twenty minutes--fifty miles--later, Samms left the Skyway at a point  near what had once been South Norwalk, Connecticut; an area transformed  now into the level square miles of New York Spaceport.    New York Spaceport; then, and until the establishment of Prime  Base, the biggest and busiest field in existence upon any planet of  Civilization. For New York City, long the financial and commercial  capital of the Earth, had maintained the same dominant position in the  affairs of the Solar System and was holding a substantial lead over her  rivals, Chicago, London, and Stalingrad, in the race for inter-stellar  supremacy.    And Virgil Samms himself, because of the ever-increasing menace of  piracy, had been largely responsible for the policy of basing the  war-vessels of the Triplanetary Patrol upon each space-field in direct  ratio to the size and importance of that field. Hence he was no  stranger in New York Spaceport; in fact, master psychologist that he  was, he had made it a point to know by first name practically everyone  connected with it.    No sooner had he turned his Dillingham over to a smiling attendant,  however, than he was accosted by a man whom he had never seen before.    \"Mr. Samms?\" the stranger asked.    \"Yes.\" Samms did not energize his Lens; he had not yet developed either  the inclination or the technique to probe instantaneously every entity  who approached him, upon any pretext whatever, in order to find out  what that entity _really_ wanted.    \"I'm Isaacson ...\" the man paused, as though he had supplied a world of  information.    \"Yes?\" Samms was receptive, but not impressed.    \"Interstellar Spaceways, you know. We've been trying to see you for  two weeks, but we couldn't get past your secretaries, so I decided to  buttonhole you here, myself. But we're just as much alone here as we  would be in either one of our offices--yes, more so. What I want to  talk to you about is having our exclusive franchise extended to cover  the outer planets and the colonies.\"    \"Just a minute, Mr. Isaacson. Surely you know that I no longer have  even a portfolio in the Council; that practically all of my attention  is, and for some time to come will be, directed elsewhere?\"    \"Exactly--_officially_.\" Isaacson's tone spoke volumes. \"But you're  still the Boss; they'll do anything you tell them to. We couldn't try  to do business with you before, of course, but in your present position  there is nothing whatever to prevent you from getting into the biggest  thing that will ever be. We are the biggest corporation in existence  now, as you know, and we are still growing--fast. We don't do business  in a small way, or with small men; so here's a check for a million  credits, or I will deposit it to your account....\"    \"I'm not interested.\"    \"As a binder,\" the other went on, as smoothly as though his sentence  had not been interrupted, \"with twenty-five million more to follow on  the day that our franchise goes through.\"    \"I'm still not interested.\"    \"No ... o ... o ...?\" Isaacson studied the Lensman narrowly: and Samms,  Lens now wide awake, studied the entrepreneur. \"Well ... I ... while  I admit that we want you pretty badly, you are smart enough to know  that we'll get what we want anyway, with or without you. With you,  though, it will be easier and quicker, so I am authorized to offer you,  besides the twenty six million credits ...\" he savored the words as he  uttered them: \"twenty two and one-half percent of Spaceways. On today's  market that is worth fifty million credits; ten years from now it will  be worth fifty _billion_. That's my high bid; that's as high as we can  possibly go.\"    \"I'm glad to hear that--I'm _still_ not interested,\" and Samms strode  away, calling his friend Kinnison as he did so.    \"Rod? Virgil.\" He told the story.    \"Whew!\" Kinnison whistled expressively. \"They're not pikers, anyway,  are they? What a _sweet_ set-up--and you could wrap it up and hand it  to them like a pound of coffee....\"    \"Or you could, Rod.\"    \"Could be....\" The big Lensman ruminated. \"But _what_ a hookup!  Perfectly legitimate, and with plenty of precedents--and arguments, of  a sort--in its favor. The outer planets. Then Alpha Centauri and Sirius  and Procyon and so on. Monopoly--all the traffic will bear....\"    \"Slavery, you mean!\" Samms stormed. \"It would hold Civilization back  for a thousand years!\"    \"Sure, but what do _they_ care?\"    \"That's it ... and he said--and actually believed--that they would get  it without my help.... I can't help wondering about that.\"    \"Simple enough, Virge, when you think about it. He doesn't know yet  what a Lensman is. Nobody does, you know, except Lensmen. It will take  some time for that knowledge to get around....\"    \"And still longer for it to be _believed_.\"    \"Right. But as to the chance of Interstellar Spaceways ever getting the  monopoly they're working for, I didn't think I would have to remind you  that it was not entirely by accident that over half of the members of  the Solarian Council are Lensmen, and that any Galactic Councillor will  automatically _have_ to be a Lensman. So go right ahead with what you  started, my boy, and don't give Isaacson and Company another thought.  We'll bend an optic or two in that direction while you are gone.\"    \"I was overlooking a few things, at that, I guess.\" Samms sighed in  relief as he entered the main office of the Patrol.    The line at the receptionist's desk was fairly short, but even  so, Samms was not allowed to wait. That highly decorative, but  far-from-dumb blonde, breaking off in mid-sentence her business of  the moment, turned on her charm as though it had been a battery of  floodlights, pressed a stud on her desk, and spoke to the man before  her and to the Lensman:    \"Excuse me a moment, please. First Lensman Samms, sir...?\"    \"Yes, Miss Regan?\" her communicator--\"squawk-box\", in every day  parlance--broke in.    \"First Lensman Samms is here, sir,\" the girl announced, and broke the  circuit.    \"Good evening, Sylvia. Lieutenant-Commander Wagner, please, or whoever  else is handling clearances,\" Samms answered what he thought was to  have been her question.    \"Oh, no, sir; you are cleared. Commodore Clayton has been waiting for  you ... here he is, now.\"    \"Hi, Virgil!\" Commodore Clayton, a big, solid man with a scarred face  and a shock of iron-gray hair, whose collar bore the two silver stars  which proclaimed him to be the commander-in-chief of a continental  contingent of the Patrol, shook hands vigorously. \"I'll zip you out.  Miss Regan, call a bug, please.\"    \"Oh, that isn't necessary, Alex!\" Samms protested. \"I'll pick one up  outside.\"    \"Not in any Patrol base in North America, my friend; nor, unless I am  very badly mistaken, anywhere else. From now on, Lensmen have absolute  priority, and the quicker everybody realizes exactly what that means,  the better.\"    The \"bug\"--a vehicle something like a jeep, except more so--was waiting  at the door.
