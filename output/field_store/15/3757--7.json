A white stripe also is  present on the outer edge of the forearm and fourth finger. In breeding  males the throat is dark gray.    Little geographic variation in color or pattern is evident. Few, if any,  specimens from the Pacific lowlands of South America are green in life.  (We have seen no living individuals from South America.) Some living  individuals from Costa Rica and all those seen alive from Nicaragua have  a tint of pale blue on the flanks. In some specimens the dorsal pattern  is so faint as to be barely discernible, whereas in most specimens the  pattern is bold.    The coloration in the living frogs is highly variable due to extreme  metachrosis. Individuals of this species are capable of changing the  dorsal coloration from green to brown in a short period of time. Both  green and brown individuals have been found active at night. Usually  those individuals found hiding by day are brown. One individual from  Finca La Sumbadora, Panama (now KU 91914), was kept alive in the  laboratory for nearly one month. This individual usually was pale green  with tan dorsal markings at night and tan with pale green markings by  day. On occasion the pale green dorsal markings were boldly outlined by  bright dark green.    In living individuals from throughout the range of the species the iris  is a bronze color, darkest medially with fine black reticulations.    _Natural History._--_Smilisca phaeota_ inhabits humid lowland tropical  forest and seldom ascends the foothills to more than 1,000 meters. The  rather equable climatic conditions, especially more or less evenly  distributed rainfall throughout the year, permit this frog to be active  most of the year. Dunn (1931:413) reported males calling on Barro  Colorado Island, Panama, in February and in July, and Breder (1946:416)  noted calling individuals in the Chucanaque drainage of Darien, Panama  in January, March, July, August and October and in Costa Rica in April  through August inclusively. Calling males were found at Bonanza,  Nicaragua in March and in July.    At all times of year the usual daytime retreats for these frogs are near  water; the frogs have been found in elephant ear plants (_Xanthosoma_)  and in bromeliads; occasional individuals have been found sitting on  shaded branches of bushes and trees. None has been observed on the  ground or beneath ground-cover by day.    The length of the breeding season cannot be determined definitely. The  earliest date on which eggs have been found is May 23; Gaige, Hartweg,  and Stuart (1937:5) reported a gravid female taken at El Recreo,  Nicaragua, in September, and we have a gravid female taken at Almirante,  Panama, in March.    Males usually call from secluded spots at the edge of water. All calling  males that we observed were on the ground within a few centimeters of  the water. The males usually are hidden beneath an overhanging leaf or  some other cover; they definitely do not sit in the open like _Smilisca  baudini_. Most calling males and clasping pairs have been found at the  edges of small pools or shallow ditches, although occasional individuals  are found at the edges of large ponds or streams.    The breeding call consists of one or two moderately short, low-pitched  notes (duration 0.33 to 0.42 seconds), repeated at intervals of about 20  seconds to several minutes. Each note is a low, vibrant \"wauk,\" having  100 to 130 pulses per second and a dominant frequency of 330 to 420  cycles per second (Pl. 10C).    The eggs are deposited in loose clumps amidst vegetation in the water.  Hatchling tadpoles have total lengths of 8.7 to 10.6 mm., and body  lengths of 4.1 to 4.5 mm. The external gills are long and filamentous,  and the yolk sac is large. The head and caudal musculature are dark  brownish black, and the caudal fins are gray. The oral discs are large  and roughly circular. The growth and development of the tadpoles are  summarized in table 11 and figure 16.    A typical tadpole in stage 30 of development (KU 68482 from the Rio  Chitaria, Cartago Province, Costa Rica) may be described as follows:  body length 9.7 mm.; tail length 14.6 mm.; total length 24.3 mm.; body  as wide as deep; snout rounded dorsally and laterally; eyes widely  separated, directed dorsolaterally; nostril about midway between eye  and tip of snout; mouth anteroventral; spiracle sinistral, about midway  on length of body and slightly below midline; anal tube dextral; caudal  musculature slender, curved upward distally; dorsal fin extending onto  body; depth of dorsal fin slightly less than that of ventral fin at  mid-length of tail; dorsal part of body pale brown; ventral surfaces  transparent with scattered pigment; pale cream-colored, crescent-shaped  mark on posterior edge of body; caudal musculature pale creamy tan with  scattered pale brown spots; caudal fins transparent with scattered small  brown blotches on dorsal and ventral fins; iris pale bronze in life  (Fig. 13); mouth small; median part of upper lip bare; rest of mouth  bordered by one row of pointed papillae; lateral fold present;  tooth-rows 2/3, first upper row longest; second upper row slightly  shorter, broadly interrupted medially; three lower rows complete, equal  in length, slightly shorter than second upper row; upper beak moderately  deep, forming broad arch with slender lateral processes; lower beak  slender, broadly V-shaped; both beaks serrate (Fig. 15E).    In tadpoles having fully developed mouthparts the tooth-row formula of  2/3 is invariable. The pale crescent-shaped mark on the posterior part  of the body curves anterodorsally on the dorsal surface of the body.  These marks in dorsal view give the appearance of a pair of short, pale  stripes on the posterior part of the body. Most specimens from Costa  Rica have the pale coloration like that described above, but some  individuals (notable KU 87683 from Guapiles, Costa Rica, KU 87707 from  Finca Tepeyac, Nicaragua, and KU 87708 from Bonanza, Nicaragua) have  much more pigment. In these specimens the same color pattern obtains as  in the pallid individuals, but the pigmentation is dense. This is  especially noticeable on the tail.    Recently metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 12.7 to 16.7 mm.  (average, 14.3 mm. in eleven specimens). Coloration of young in life (KU  68484 from Rio Chitaria, Cartago Province, Costa Rica): \"Dorsum pale  tan; side of head and flanks darker brown, separated from tan dorsum by  an indistinct cream stripe. Limbs pale yellow; thighs flecked with  brown; shank and tarsus yellowish tan with indistinct brown bars. Soles  of feet brown. Belly white; throat dusty cream flecked with silvery  white. Upper lip silvery white. Iris bright gold with black flecks.  Heels, tarsal and anal stripes white\" (Duellman, field notes, May 23,  1961).    _Remarks._--Peters (1863:463) named _Hyla labialis_ from the \"region of  Bogota, Colombia\", but in 1873 regarded his new species as identical  with _Hyla phaeota_ Cope, 1862, from Turbo, Colombia. The name _Hyla  labialis_ has been used for frogs from the northern Andes in Colombia  (see Dunn, 1944:72, and Stebbins and Hendrickson, 1959:522, for  discussion of nomenclature). Rivero (1961:131) used the name _Hyla  vilsoniana_ Cope, 1899, for the frogs from the northern Andes previously  referred to _Hyla labialis_. A review of the nomenclature and taxonomy  of these frogs, which superficially resemble _Smilisca_ but are  unrelated, is beyond the scope of the present study.    _Hyla baudini dolomedes_ Barbour, 1923, is based on a small _Smilisca  phaeota_ (MCZ 8539) having a snout-vent length of 45.5 mm. Dunn  (1931a:413) placed _dolomedes_ in the synonymy of _Smilisca phaeota_. We  have examined the holotype of _dolomedes_ and agree with Dunn's  assignment.    Smith (1953:150) described _Hyla phaeota cyanosticta_ from Guatemala.  Our studies on the external morphology, coloration, and especially the  cranial osteology provide evidence that _cyanosticta_ is a species  distinct from _phaeota_.    _Distribution._--_Smilisca phaeota_ inhabits humid tropical forests from  northeastern Nicaragua southward on the Caribbean lowlands to elevations  of about 1000 meters and on the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica,  exclusive of the arid regions of Guanacaste, throughout the lowlands of  Panama, exclusive of the savannas of the Pacific lowland and the Azuero  Peninsula, and southward on the Pacific slopes of South America through  Colombia to west-central Ecuador; also the valleys of the Rio Cauca and  Rio Magdalena in Colombia (Fig. 2).    _Specimens examined._--528, as follows: NICARAGUA: =Matagalpa=: Finca  Tepeyac, 10 km.

This was more than I could put up  with, and I selected a particularly trustworthy man, a naik (corporal)  in the police named Kurum Singh, [13] who knew the Naga language, and  would, I was convinced, speak out fearlessly, and deliver my message. I  sent him off at once to Konoma to call upon the head-men to come in  without delay, and make their humble submission to me within a day  and a half of receiving the summons, failing which I would attack and  destroy their village. Kurum Singh left, and I felt rather anxious,  as Konoma contained five times as many warriors as I had police all  told, and it occupied a strong position; however, I felt I had done  my duty. It was a great satisfaction when Kurum Singh returned,  saying that the chiefs were coming in, and they did so within the  stipulated time, and made their submission and presented me with a  large state spear as a token of it. They also humbly apologised and  promised never to molest that Kutcha Naga village again; and when I  spoke of the Queen, begged me to write to her and say, that she must  not believe any idle tales against the Konoma men, as they would be  her humble servants. It was a satisfactory ending to what might have  been a troublesome business. The state spear now ornaments my hall.    On the 23rd June, my wife presented me with a son, and he being the  first child of pure European parentage born in the hills, the Nagas  of Samagudting took great interest in the baby, and old Yatsole the  Peumah, said he should be their chief and named him \"Naga Rajah.\" The  friendly women and girls from the village constantly came to see  him. We liked the hills and the people, and the work so much that we  both felt we could willingly have passed our lives among them. All  the same, our accommodation was really most wretched, and food was  bad and scarce, and water scarcer. As the rainy season advanced the  place grew more and more unhealthy, and having a baby to attend to,  my wife never left Samagudting. I continued to go down to Dimapur  occasionally, and sometimes rode out with my friend Needham to inspect  the path that was being cut to Mohung Deejood and a rest house being  built at a place in the forest on that road, called Borsali. It was  pleasant to have a companion during a long lonely ride. Needham was an  indefatigable worker, and always ready for a dash. He made a capital  frontier officer, and has since greatly distinguished himself on the  N.-E. Frontier.    Towards the end of August, the Vanda Caerulea orchids began to come  into flower. There was a magnificent plant of them in a large old tree  on the summit of the hill, indeed the most splendid specimen of their  kind that I ever saw; but wild flowers, many really beautiful, were  generally procurable, especially a small snow-white flower rather like  a periwinkle that grew in the jungle on a small ever-green bush. Ferns,  including maidenhair, were very plentiful, and we made collections  of them in our morning and evening walks. These walks often led us  past stray huts, and once my wife was asked to come into one and  prescribe for a sick Naga woman. We both entered it and finding that  the woman had fever, we told her husband to keep her cool and quiet,  and promised some medicine. When we again went to see her, the hut,  about nine feet by seven feet in size, was full of little fires on the  floor, over which several Nagas were drying strips of flesh from an  elephant that had been killed a few miles away. The temperature must  have been about 110 degrees, so little wonder that the poor woman was  no better. The husband said she would not take her medicine, and when  in our presence he attempted to give it she hit him on the head; yet he  wore the warrior's kilt, so had taken at least one life. When my wife  sat down by her and gave her the medicine she took it readily. Towards  the end of the rainy season many were laid low by fever. Natives of  other parts of India until thoroughly acclimatised, suffer greatly  from the diseases peculiar to jungle districts, and our servants were  not exceptions to the rule. Once acclimatised, a Hindoostani seems  able to stand anything. It used to be said in my regiment, the 1st  Assam Light Infantry Battalion, now 42nd, that Hindoostani recruits  spent their first three years' service in hospital! I am sure that  something of the same kind might have been said of those who came to  the Naga Hills before the headquarters were removed to Kohima.    Captain Butler, recognising the unsuitableness of Samagudting for  a station, had recommended the removal of the headquarters to Woka,  in the Lotah Naga country, and about sixty-three miles from Kohima. I  spoke to him on the subject, and pointed out the superior advantages of  Kohima as a central position, dominating the Angami Naga country. He  quite agreed with me, but said he had advocated Woka as being nearer  the plains, nearer water carriage, and altogether a more comfortable  situation, especially for the officers. I went into the whole subject  most carefully, and before leaving the Naga Hills I thought it right to  record my opinion in a memorandum to the Government of Assam. This I  did, pointing out as forcibly as I could the very superior advantages  of Kohima, and urging most strongly that it should be adopted as our  headquarters station in the Naga Hills. As I was only the officiating  agent, I could not expect my views to carry as much weight as Captain  Butler's, but convinced as I was, I was bound to state them. The  question was not settled for some years when Kohima was the site  selected, and it has ever since been the headquarters station.    I had never got over the attack of fever I had in April, and as  the rainy season advanced, and we were for days together enveloped  in mist, I had constant attacks, with other complications, and as  Captain Butler was coming out in November, and the doctor strongly  recommended me to go to England again, I determined to apply for  leave. My friend Needham had gone on leave to Shillong, so I could  not think of starting till he returned. He was due at Samagudting  early in November, and I prepared to leave then. It was with most  sincere regret that we made arrangements for starting. We had got  used to the discomforts of the place and had been very happy there  and liked the people, and felt that they liked us; the cold weather  too was just beginning and everything around us looked beautiful.    I had determined to march straight through the forest to Doboka, and  thence take boat down the Kullung river to Gowhatty. It was a dreadful  march to undertake, along a mere track untraversed by any European for  years, but my wife liked the idea of it, and it was shorter than the  route via Nigriting. On November 6th, we reluctantly said \"good-bye\"  to all our kind friends at Samagudting and marched to Dimapur, where  we halted next day to get all our things into order. Some of the  chiefs of Samagudting accompanied us so far on our way and bade us a  sorrowful adieu on the 7th. One old fellow took quite an affectionate  farewell of our baby Dick. When I saw him again in 1879, he was blind,  and one of his pretty little girls was dying.    We marched through dense forest on the 8th to Borsali, my wife  riding and carrying the baby in her arms, there being no other mode  of progression along such a bad road. On the 9th after seven hours'  actual marching, we reached Mohung Deejood, a place prettily situated  on the banks of the Jumoona river with the last speck of the Rengma  Hills standing out in high relief behind the village, but at some  distance from it. Next day we again had a tiring march of eleven hours,  including a halt for breakfast at a place called \"Silbheta\" where  there are splendid waterfalls, and did not reach our halting place,  Bokuleea, till 6 P.M. The last two marches had been through a country  devastated by tigers which had literally eaten up the population; each  day we passed deserted village sites. At Bokuleea we made rafts and  floated down the river to Doboka, which we reached on November 13th.    Doboka is situated close to the hill of the same name and was  a prominent object from Samagudting. There we took boats, and  travelled in them down the Kullung river. We reached the junction  with the Burrhampooter at daybreak on November 17th, and Gowhatty  at midday. I was most thankful to see my wife and child safe in the  Dak Bungalow after what was for delicate people a perilous journey,  though an interesting and enjoyable one, through a country hardly ever  traversed by European officials, and never by women and children. After  a few days at Gowhatty to rest ourselves, we departed by steamer for  Goalundo, arriving there early on November 29th, and immediately left  for Calcutta, which we reached the same evening and went to stay with  our kind friends the Rivers Thompsons, with whom we had travelled  out to India in 1873. Glad as we were to be in civilised quarters  once more after all our wanderings, we could not help regretting the  kindly genial people we had left, and the beautiful scenery of the  forest and mountain land, where we had lived so long and so happily.    On arrival in Calcutta, I went before the Medical Board, but not liking  to go to England again so soon, I applied for three months' leave  to visit the North-West Provinces for change of air, and we visited  Benares, Lucknow, Cawnpore, and other towns. I do not attempt to  describe them, as it has been often done by abler pens than mine. The  after symptoms of malaria increased, and it was vain to prolong my stay  in India in the hope of a cure. The Medical Board said my appearance  was sufficient without examination, so we left Calcutta by the next  steamer, going by \"l"]]]
