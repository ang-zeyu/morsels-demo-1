On the 9th General Smith-Dorrien, moving east-north-east,  encountered the Boers, and Colonel Mackenzie and his gallant men, with  the assistance of the 2nd Imperial Light Horse, succeeded in  capturing a convoy and putting twenty-one Boers _hors de combat_ by a  brilliant charge.    Affairs were somewhat hampered by lack of supplies, but at last (on  the 10th) a convoy from Standerton having come in, the right wing  (Dartnell and Allenby) were provided for. On the following day General  French moved on, while Colville's emptied waggons started back with a  pathetic load of Boer families and prisoners and British sick.    [Illustration: POSITION OF FORCES AROUND ERMELO]    On the 12th, the Boers offered some opposition to the advancing troops  of Pulteney and Allenby, and near Klipfontein they, for a wonder, made  a stand, and gave Colonel Rimington and the Inniskilling Dragoons an  opportunity for smart work. A dashing charge, magnificently led,  cleared the ground, and five dead Boers and some wounded were left to  tell the tale of the encounter.    On the 13th Dartnell, who had taken up a position at Amersfoort, moved  from thence steadily in line with the whole force, which proceeded  with insignificant opposition to clear away stock and destroy  supplies.    Amsterdam was occupied by Smith-Dorrien on the 14th, and on the 16th  General French, with the troops of Knox and Pulteney, made his entry  into Piet Retief, where the landdrost at once surrendered. Rains had  now made the already almost impassable country into one mighty morass,  and the mists, fogs, and torrents rendered the position of the troops  a critical one. Great consternation prevailed as to the fate of  Colonel Burn-Murdoch, on whom all hopes were set. He had been charged  by the General Officer Commanding in Natal with the duty of conveying,  from Utrecht, food to the force, and had apparently got lost in the  mists and bog, for not a sign of his anxiously awaited convoy could be  discovered. This convoy had left Newcastle on the 12th, but it was not  till the 27th that its welcome supplies reached the famishing troops,  who, from the 20th, had had to subsist entirely on the country, while  the horses ate grass only. The rivers had by this time become raging  torrents, and the roads, quagmires. The Boer farms had already been  cleared out, and only by offering a sovereign for a 200-lb. bag of  mealies could the natives be prevailed upon to unearth their buried  treasure. The ration during this lean period sounds distinctly  unpleasing: three-quarters of a pound of mealie meal (ground in the  steam mill at Piet Retief), and an ounce of mealie coffee (an infusion  of the same meal roasted and ground), made the sole variation to a  diet of saltless meat. The men nevertheless maintained their health  and cheeriness, their constant hauls conducing much to their  enlivenment, and the number in hospital was abnormally low. Still  there was vast annoyance in the fact that they were unable to be up  and doing.    A new line of supply was opened on the 28th, when Colonel Bullock  started from Volkrust to Piet Retief with a convoy of ninety-one  waggons. Though this reached its destination in safety on the 5th of  March, it was not till he returned with a second load, on the 21st of  March, that sufficient oats could reach Piet Retief to enable the  force to move. Despite the inconvenience of delay a tremendous amount  of work was carried on, the troops pushing continually into Swaziland  and tackling Boers who struggled to slip through the British line, and  many captures were made both north and south of the border. The  surrounding country was thoroughly cleared, and many guns and much  ammunition were brought to light. The Engineers also worked like  Trojans, improving the roads and bridging the numerous, now swollen,  rivers and spruits that abounded in the district. As an instance of  the force of the unceasing floods between the 6th and 13th of March,  it may be mentioned that the Assegai, which is normally fordable,  averaged 12 feet in depth, and on the 12th rose to 18 feet.    [Illustration: A NIGHT ATTACK: DEFENDING A TRAIN DERAILED BY THE BOERS    Drawing by Frank Dadd, R.I.]    The position of the forces on the 1st of March stood thus:--    General Smith-Dorrien (who had moved south from Amsterdam on the 25th  of February) was now eight miles north of Piet Retief, while his  mounted troops, under Colonel Henry, had penetrated into Swaziland. At  Piet Retief was General French, with Colonels Knox and Pulteney, some  of whose mounted troops, under Colonel Rimington, were covering the  road south-west of Luneberg as far as Schihoek, whence Colonel  Burn-Murdoch carried on the line to Utrecht. Colonels Campbell and  Allenby were twelve and seventeen miles south-east of Piet Retief  respectively, Colonel Alderson was at Marienthal, and General Dartnell  at Intombi River. Colonel Bullock was at Wakkerstroom.    Soon the Utrecht-Luneberg line was abandoned as a line of supply, and  the troops were based on Utrecht. On the 18th of March General  Dartnell occupied the village of Paul Pietersburg, and Colonel  Rimington seized the stone bridge over the Pivaan River running south  of it, while Colonel Alderson built a pontoon bridge over the Pongola  River at Yagd Drift.    On the 21st General French, with Colonels Knox and Pulteney, moved on,  leaving General Smith-Dorrien in command north of the Pongola. Here  the latter, with the columns of Colonels Campbell and Allenby, held a  line from Langdraai Drift, in the Lower Pongolo, by Platnek, Mahamba,  Zaudbauk, and Piet Retief, to Yagd Drift, so as to prevent Boers from  breaking north and north-west.    Colonel Knox now set about clearing the country to the east, between  the Pivaan and Pongola Rivers, to prevent the Boers breaking back  south of the Pongola, while General French, continuing his march with  the columns of General Dartnell and Colonel Pulteney, moved on  Vryheid, where he established his headquarters on the 25th of March.  Here General Hildyard had accumulated a large reserve of supplies for  the whole force, thus materially facilitating the progress of further  operations.    The movement to clear the angle between the Swazi and Zulu frontiers  began on the 27th of March and terminated on the 15th of April.  General Dartnell, with ten days' supplies, moved east from Vryheid,  with Pulteney east-south-east on his right rear, and Alderson (who  started two days later from some four miles south of the Pivaan  Bridge) on his left rear. Colonel Pulteney speedily came in contact  with Grobelaar's commando, drove it north, where it came in collision  with General Dartnell, who, after some skirmishing, killed and wounded  some twenty Boers. The General was now forced to push on with mounted  troops and a few guns only, for the country was impassable for wheeled  transport, and therefore it had to be left behind in charge of the  infantry. He formed a depot some thirty miles east-south-east of  Vryheid, while Colonel Alderson formed his about twenty-five miles  north-east of Vryheid.    More fighting took place on the 31st between the Boers and General  Dartnell some twelve miles north of his depot, in which engagement  four Boers were slain, ten taken prisoners, and waggons, cattle, and  sheep were captured. Their pom-pom--previously destroyed to prevent it  being of service to us--was thrown over a precipice by the flying foe.  The troops moving on east through the low-lying bush veldt came on  more Boers on the 2nd, engaged them, cleared the country, returned to  Toovernsaarsrust on the 4th, and moved on the 5th and 6th to Vryheid,  where General Dartnell for five days took a well-earned rest.    Colonel Alderson had meanwhile taken a prodigious share in the work.  He had sped hot foot after a party of Boers that had broken  northwards, caught them on the 3rd near the junction of the Pivaan and  Pongola Rivers, and succeeded in effecting the capture of their  cattle, waggons, and mules. On the following day he rested at  Nooitgadacht, a place six miles east of Vryheid. He then (on the 6th)  passed Vryheid, and proceeded, in three columns, to sweep the country  south of that place, while General Dartnell acted as a stop on the  line Vryheid-Toovernsaarsrust. By the 13th Colonel Alderson had  fulfilled his mission, and \"accomplished all that was feasible.\" He  then returned to Vryheid, and the difficult and fatiguing operations  were practically concluded.    The various columns now left from this part of the theatre of war in  the following order: Colonel Pulteney, being urgently needed by the  Commander-in-Chief for use in the north of Middelburg, left Vryheid on  the 1st, and entrained from Glencoe on the 4th. General Dartnell on  the 12th, from Vryheid, marched _via_ Newcastle to Volkrust, there to  rest and refit. General Alderson passed through Vryheid on the 13th,  reaching the rail at Glencoe on the 16th, and General Smith-Dorrien  with his own, Colonel Campbell's, and Colonel Allenby's columns,  marched north from Piet Retief on the 14th towards the Delagoa  Railway.    The results of the prodigious energy of General French's force during  the two and a half months, from the 27th of January to the 16th of  April, were amazing. These zealous and untiring warriors had entirely  swept the country between the Delagoa and Natal railway lines, from  Johannesburg to the Swazi and Zulu frontiers, travelling across the  most difficult country, rendered doubly so by tempest and flood, and  living almost on starvation fare.    Nevertheless 1332 Boers had been placed _hors de combat_ (369 killed  and wounded, 233 taken prisoners, 730 surrendered), while an  incalculable amount of supplies had been removed or destroyed,  including 11 guns, 1280 rifles, 218,249 rounds of ammunition, 2281  waggons and carts, and 272,752 "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#11)"],[1,"at it on her palm in her  mysterious, curious, half-smiling way, and pocketed it at once with  a \"Merci, monsieur!\" that had a touch of contempt in it. I always  fancy Cesarine has large ideas of her own on the subject of tipping,  and thinks very small beer of the modest sums a mere secretary can  alone afford to bestow upon her.    The great peculiarity of Meran is the number of schlosses (I believe  my plural is strictly irregular, but very convenient to English  ears) which you can see in every direction from its outskirts. A  statistical eye, it is supposed, can count no fewer than forty of  these picturesque, ramshackled old castles from a point on the  Kuechelberg. For myself, I hate statistics (except as an element in  financial prospectuses), and I really don't know how many ruinous  piles Isabel and Amelia counted under Cesarine's guidance; but I  remember that most of them were quaint and beautiful, and that their  variety of architecture seemed positively bewildering. One would be  square, with funny little turrets stuck out at each angle; while  another would rejoice in a big round keep, and spread on either side  long, ivy-clad walls and delightful bastions. Charles was immensely  taken with them. He loves the picturesque, and has a poet hidden  in that financial soul of his. (Very effectually hidden, though, I  am ready to grant you.) From the moment he came he felt at once  he would love to possess a castle of his own among these romantic  mountains. \"Seldon!\" he exclaimed contemptuously. \"They call Seldon  a castle! But you and I know very well, Sey, it was built in 1860,  with sham antique stones, for Macpherson of Seldon, at market rates,  by Cubitt and Co., worshipful contractors of London. Macpherson  charged me for that sham antiquity a preposterous price, at  which one ought to procure a real ancestral mansion. Now, _these_  castles are real. They are hoary with antiquity. Schloss Tyrol is  Romanesque--tenth or eleventh century.\" (He had been reading it up  in Baedeker.) \"That's the sort of place for _me_!--tenth or eleventh  century. I could live here, remote from stocks and shares, for ever;  and in these sequestered glens, recollect, Sey, my boy, there are  no Colonel Clays, and no arch Madame Picardets!\"    As a matter of fact, he could have lived there six weeks, and then  tired for Park Lane, Monte Carlo, Brighton.    As for Amelia, strange to say, she was equally taken with this new  fad of Charles's. As a rule she hates everywhere on earth save  London, except during the time when no respectable person can be  seen in town, and when modest blinds shade the scandalised face of  Mayfair and Belgravia. She bores herself to death even at Seldon  Castle, Ross-shire, and yawns all day long in Paris or Vienna. She  is a confirmed Cockney. Yet, for some occult reason, my amiable  sister-in-law fell in love with South Tyrol. She wanted to vegetate  in that lush vegetation. The grapes were being picked; pumpkins hung  over the walls; Virginia creeper draped the quaint gray schlosses  with crimson cloaks; and everything was as beautiful as a dream of  Burne-Jones's. (I know I am quite right in mentioning Burne-Jones,  especially in connection with Romanesque architecture, because I  heard him highly praised on that very ground by our friend and  enemy, Dr. Edward Polperro.) So perhaps it was excusable that  Amelia should fall in love with it all, under the circumstances;  besides, she is largely influenced by what Cesarine says, and  Cesarine declares there is no climate in Europe like Meran in  winter. I do not agree with her. The sun sets behind the hills at  three in the afternoon, and a nasty warm wind blows moist over  the snow in January and February.    However, Amelia set Cesarine to inquire of the people at the hotel  about the market price of tumbledown ruins, and the number of such  eligible family mausoleums just then for sale in the immediate  neighbourhood. Cesarine returned with a full, true, and particular  list, adorned with flowers of rhetoric which would have delighted  the soul of good old John Robins. They were all picturesque, all  Romanesque, all richly ivy-clad, all commodious, all historical,  and all the property of high well-born Grafs and very honourable  Freiherrs. Most of them had been the scene of celebrated tournaments;  several of them had witnessed the gorgeous marriages of Holy Roman  Emperors; and every one of them was provided with some choice and  selected first-class murders. Ghosts could be arranged for or not,  as desired; and armorial bearings could be thrown in with the moat  for a moderate extra remuneration.    The two we liked best of all these tempting piles were Schloss  Planta and Schloss Lebenstein. We drove past both, and even I  myself, I confess, was distinctly taken with them. (Besides, when  a big purchase like this is on the stocks, a poor beggar of a  secretary has always a chance of exerting his influence and earning  for himself some modest commission.) Schloss Planta was the most  striking externally, I should say, with its Rhine-like towers, and  its great gnarled ivy-stems, that looked as if they antedated the  House of Hapsburg; but Lebenstein was said to be better preserved  within, and more fitted in every way for modern occupation. Its  staircase has been photographed by 7000 amateurs.    We got tickets to view. The invaluable Cesarine procured them for  us. Armed with these, we drove off one fine afternoon, meaning to  go to Planta, by Cesarine's recommendation. Half-way there, however,  we changed our minds, as it was such a lovely day, and went on up  the long, slow hill to Lebenstein. I must say the drive through the  grounds was simply charming. The castle stands perched (say rather  poised, like St. Michael the archangel in Italian pictures) on a  solitary stack or crag of rock, looking down on every side upon  its own rich vineyards. Chestnuts line the glens; the valley of  the Etsch spreads below like a picture.    The vineyards alone make a splendid estate, by the way; they produce  a delicious red wine, which is exported to Bordeaux, and there  bottled and sold as a vintage claret under the name of Chateau  Monnivet. Charles revelled in the idea of growing his own wines.    \"Here we could sit,\" he cried to Amelia, \"in the most literal sense,  under our own vine and fig-tree. Delicious retirement! For my part,  I'm sick and tired of the hubbub of Threadneedle Street.\"    We knocked at the door--for there was really no bell, but a  ponderous, old-fashioned, wrought-iron knocker. So deliciously  mediaeval! The late Graf von Lebenstein had recently died, we  knew; and his son, the present Count, a young man of means, having  inherited from his mother's family a still more ancient and  splendid schloss in the Salzburg district, desired to sell this  outlying estate in order to afford himself a yacht, after the manner  that is now becoming increasingly fashionable with the noblemen and  gentlemen in Germany and Austria.    The door was opened for us by a high well-born menial, attired in  a very ancient and honourable livery. Nice antique hall; suits of  ancestral armour, trophies of Tyrolese hunters, coats of arms of  ancient counts--the very thing to take Amelia's aristocratic and  romantic fancy. The whole to be sold exactly as it stood; ancestors  to be included at a valuation.    We went through the reception-rooms. They were lofty, charming, and  with glorious views, all the more glorious for being framed by those  graceful Romanesque windows, with their slender pillars and quaint,  round-topped arches. Sir Charles had made his mind up. \"I must and  will have it!\" he cried. \"This is the place for me. Seldon! Pah,  Seldon is a modern abomination.\"    Could we see the high well-born Count? The liveried servant  (somewhat haughtily) would inquire of his Serenity. Sir Charles  sent up his card, and also Lady Vandrift's. These foreigners know  title spells money in England.    He was right in his surmise. Two minutes later the Count entered  with our cards in his hands. A good-looking young man, with the  characteristic Tyrolese long black moustache, dressed in a  gentlemanly variant on the costume of the country. His air was a  jager's; the usual blackcock's plume stuck jauntily in the side of  the conical hat (which he held in his hand), after the universal  Austrian fashion.    He waved us to seats. We sat down. He spoke to us in French; his  English, he remarked, with a pleasant smile, being a negligeable  quantity. We might speak it, he went on; he could understand pretty  well; but he preferred to answer, if we would allow him, in French  or German.    \"French,\" Charles replied, and the negotiation continued thenceforth  in that language. It is the only one, save English and his ancestral  Dutch, with which my brother-in-law possesses even a nodding  acquaintance.    We praised the beautiful scene. The Count's face lighted up with  patriotic pride. Yes; it was beautiful, beautiful, his own green  Tyrol. He was proud of it and attached to it. But he could endure  to sell this place, the home of his fathers, because he had a finer  in the Salzkammergut, and a pied-a-terre near Innsbruck. For Tyrol  lacked just one joy--the sea. He was a passionate yachtsman. For  that he had resolved to sell this estate; after all, three country  houses, a ship, and a mansion in Vienna, are more than one man can  comfortably inhabit.    \"Exactly,\" Charles answered. \"If I can come to terms with you about  this charming estate I shall sell my own castle in the Scotch  Highlands.\" And he tried to look like a proud Scotch chief who  harangues his clansmen.    Then they got to business. The Count was a delightful man to do  business with. His manners were perfect. While we were talking to  him, a surly person, a steward or bailiff, or something of the sort,  came into the room unexpectedly and addressed him in German, which  none"]]]
