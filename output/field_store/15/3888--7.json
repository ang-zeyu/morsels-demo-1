The kind Mermaid, grieved at the sad fate of the lovers, caused them to  be changed into two tall palm trees, which stand always side by side,  whispering together of their faithful love and caressing one another  with their interlacing branches.(1)      (1) Madame d'Aulnoy.          LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD      Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl,  the prettiest creature was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond  of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman  had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so  extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.    One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:    \"Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has been  very ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter.\"    Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who  lived in another village.    As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had  a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some  faggot-makers hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was going.  The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear  a wolf talk, said to him:    \"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little  pot of butter from my mamma.\"    \"Does she live far off?\" said the Wolf.    \"Oh! ay,\" answered Little Red Riding-Hood; \"it is beyond that mill you  see there, at the first house in the village.\"    \"Well,\" said the Wolf, \"and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way  and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest.\"    The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way,  and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in  gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such  little flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before he got to  the old woman's house. He knocked at the door--tap, tap.    \"Who's there?\"    \"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,\" replied the Wolf,  counterfeiting her voice; \"who has brought you a custard and a little  pot of butter sent you by mamma.\"    The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill,  cried out:    \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"    The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he  fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above  three days that he had not touched a bit. He then shut the door and went  into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came  some time afterward and knocked at the door--tap, tap.    \"Who's there?\"    Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first  afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse,  answered:    \"'Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a  custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you.\"    The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:    \"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.\"    Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.    The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the  bed-clothes:    \"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come  and lie down with me.\"    Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being  greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes,  she said to her:    \"Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!\"    \"That is the better to hug thee, my dear.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!\"    \"That is to run the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!\"    \"That is to hear the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!\"    \"It is to see the better, my child.\"    \"Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!\"    \"That is to eat thee up.\"    And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red  Riding-Hood, and ate her all up.          THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOOD      There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had  no children; so sorry that it cannot be expressed. They went to all the  waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to  no purpose.    At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. There was a very fine  christening; and the Princess had for her god-mothers all the fairies  they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one  of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those  days. By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable.    After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company  returned to the King's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the  fairies. There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover  with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all  of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting  down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they  had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out  of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.    The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case  of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven  fairies. The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some  threats between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat by her  overheard how she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little  Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and  hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair,  as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend.    In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the  Princess. The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most  beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit  of an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in  everything she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well;  the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that  she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection.    The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite  than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a  spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company  tremble, and everybody fell a-crying.    At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings,  and spake these words aloud:    \"Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die  of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what  my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a  spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound  sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a  king's son shall come and awake her.\"    The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused  immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on  pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as  any spindle in their houses. About fifteen or sixteen years after, the  King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young  Princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the  palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a  little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was  spinning with her spindle. This good woman had never heard of the King's  proclamation against spindles.    \"What are you doing there, goody?\" said the Princess.    \"I am spinning, my pretty child,\" said the old woman, who did not know  who she was.    \"Ha!\" said the Princess, \"this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it  to me, that I may see if I can do so.\"    She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty  at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained  it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.    The good old woman, not knowing very well what to do in this affair,  cried out for help. People came in from every quarter in great numbers;  they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on  the palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but  nothing would bring her to herself.    And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of  the prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must  necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the  Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to  be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver.    One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful;  for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her  cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; indeed, her eyes were  shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about  her that she was not dead. The King commanded that they should not  disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was  come.    The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a  hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues  off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly  informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that  is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one  stride. The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour  after, in a fiery chariot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],[0,"The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#11)"],[1,"or the      Mohammedan.        CHAPTER XI.    DEATH'S HARVEST IN NAUVOO--RETURN OF PRODIGALS.    DURING the summer of 1840, death reaped a rich harvest in Nauvoo.  Before his ruthless stroke fell many worthy Saints who had been  connected with The Church from the time it was founded. Among the first  to fall was Bishop Edward Partridge. He died on the twenty-seventh of  May, in the forty-sixth year of his age. He was the first Bishop in The  Church, and in that capacity had presided over the Saints who gathered  to Zion, in Jackson County, Missouri, during the years 1831-33. Joseph  described him as a \"pattern of piety,\" and the Lord himself declared  that he was like Nathaniel of old--his heart was pure before him, and  he was without guile. His life was indeed an eventful one. He was  called from his merchandising, and became a preacher of righteousness.  Much, in fact all, of his riches fell into the hands of the mobs of  Jackson County, in the autumn of 1833, and upon his meek and uncovered  head fell a double portion of their fury. Five years later, he passed  through those trying times experienced by the Saints in their exodus  from the State of Missouri, under the exterminating order of the  infamous Governor Boggs; and at that time, he again saw the fruits of  his industry fall a prey to the rapacity of his relentless enemies.  Stripped of his earthly possessions and broken in health, he reached  Commerce, but the trials through which he passed had proven too much  for his constitution, which was never robust, and he passed away, a  victim to the intolerance and religious bigotry of this generation.    In September of the same year Father Joseph Smith, Patriarch to The  Church, and father of the Prophet Joseph, was \"gathered to his final  home,\" in the sixty-ninth year of his age. He was baptized on the sixth  day of April, 1830, and was one of the six who organized The Church on  that date. Indeed he was the one who first received the testimony of  his son after the angel Moroni visited him on that memorable night of  September 21, 1823; and it was he who first exhorted his prophet son  to be faithful and diligent to the message he had received. He endured  many persecutions on account of the claims made by his son Joseph to  being a prophet of God; for Joseph's declarations that he had received  heavenly visions and revelations together with a divine commission to  preach the Gospel of Christ, not only brought upon himself the wrath  of the ungodly, but involved his whole family in the persecutions  which followed him throughout his life. Of these things, however, his  father never complained, but endured all things patiently, and with  true heroism, and ever supported his son in carrying out the counsels  of Heaven. He was born on the twelfth of July, 1771, in Topsfield,  Massachusetts; and was the second of the seven sons of Asahel and Mary  Smith; his forefathers being among those who early came from England  to Massachusetts. He was a large man, ordinarily weighing two hundred  pounds, was six feet two inches tall, and well proportioned, strong  and active; and he stood unbowed beneath the accumulated sorrows and  hardships he had experienced during his nearly three score and ten  years of sojourn in this life. The exposures, however, that he suffered  in the exodus from Missouri brought on him consumption, of which he  died. His was an unassuming nature--noted mostly, perhaps, for its  sincerity and unwavering integrity. He was a child of nature, and one  of nature's noblest; his life had been spent in parts remote from the  busy marts, where \"wealth accumulates and men decay,\" and he had passed  through his probation on earth without being corrupted by the evil  influences of luxury or enervating civilization. He was a type of men,  so well described by one of our poets, in the following lines:      Simple their lives--yet theirs the race    When liberty sent forth her cry,    Who crowded conflicts deadliest place,    To fight--to bleed--to die;    Who stood on Bunker's heights of red,    By hope through years were led--    And witnessed Yorktown's sun    Shine on a nation's banner spread,    A nation's freedom won!    Such was the character of the first Patriarch of The Church in this  dispensation.    Another circumstance of interest in Nauvoo during this eventful summer  of 1840 was the return of a number of prodigals to The Church. I have  already stated the case of Orson Hyde. Frederick G. Williams was  dropped from his position as counselor to the Prophet in November,  1837, and in March, 1839, was excommunicated at a conference in Quincy,  Illinois. At the April conference in 1840, however, he came before  the assembled Church and \"humbly asked forgiveness, and expressed his  determination to do the will of God for the future.\" He was forgiven by  the Saints but was never restored to his former position in the First  Presidency.    About the time Thomas B. Marsh and Orson Hyde fell during the trying  scenes in Missouri, W. W. Phelps and Oliver Cowdery left The Church.  Elder Phelps was a man who had been of great service to The Church  and to the Prophet in a literary way, though some of his work in  that line was marred by pedantic verbosity, and pretension to a  knowledge of ancient languages which was not justified by any extended  acquaintance he had of them. Still, he it was who in the early rise of  The Church gave the cast to very much of The Church literature, and,  as I remarked, he had been useful to The Church and the Prophet in the  capacity of an editor and writer.    During the summer of 1840 he began to feel his way back from his  apostasy into The Church. He had seen his folly and began to tremble at  the gulf which opened at his very feet to devour him. He felt debased  and humbled, and most piteously begged to be forgiven and taken back in  the confidence of his brethren and the Saints. So interesting are the  circumstances connected with his return that I give _in extenso_ the  letters which passed between himself and the Prophet.                       W. W. PHELPS' LETTER TO JOSEPH SMITH.                                                DAYTON, OHIO, June 29, 1840.        BROTHER JOSEPH--I am alive, and with the help of God I mean to live      still. I am as a prodigal son, though I never doubt or disbelieve      the fullness of the Gospel. I have been greatly abused and humbled,      and I blessed the God of Israel when I lately read your prophetic      blessing on my head, as follows:        \"The Lord will chasten him because he taketh honor to himself, and      when his soul is greatly humbled he will forsake the evil. Then      shall the light of the Lord break upon him as at noonday, and in      him shall be no darkness,\" etc.        I have seen the folly of my way, and I tremble at the gulf I have      passed. So it is, and why I know not. I prayed and God answered,      but what could I do? Says I, \"I will repent and live, and ask my      old brethren to forgive me, and though they chasten me to death,      yet _I will die_ with them, for their God is my God. The _least      place with them_ is enough for me, yea it is bigger and better than      all Babylon.\" Then I dreamed that I was in a large house with many      mansions, with you and Hyrum and Sidney, and when it was said,      \"Supper must be made ready,\" by one of the cooks, I saw no meat,      but you said there was plenty, and showed me much, and as good as      I ever saw; and while cutting to cook, your heart and mine beat      within us, and we took each other's hand and cried for joy, and I      awoke and took courage.        I know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to      be saved if my friends will help me. Like the captain that was cast      away on a desert island; when he got off, he went to sea again,      and made his fortune the next time--so let my lot be. I have done      wrong, and am sorry. The beam is in my own eye. I have not walked      with my friends according to my holy anointing. I ask forgiveness      in the name of Jesus Christ of all the Saints, for I will do      right, God helping me. I want your fellowship; if you cannot grant      that, grant me your peace and friendship, for we are brethren, and      our communion used to be sweet, and whenever the Lord brings us      together again, _I will make all the satisfaction on every point      that Saints or God can require_. Amen.                                                             W. W. PHELPS.    Elders Hyde and Page, _en route_ for the east on their mission to  Jerusalem, met with Phelps at Dayton, and at his request these brethren  added the following to his communication:        Brother Phelps requests us to write a few lines in his letter, and      we cheerfully embrace the opportunity. Brother Phelps says he wants      to live; but we do not fell ourselves authorized to act upon his      case, but have recommended him to you; but he says his poverty will      not allow him to visit you in person at this time, and we think he      tells the truth. We therefore advise him to write, which he has      done.        He tells us verbally, that he is willing to make any sacrifice      to procure your fellowship, life not excepted, yet reposing that      confidence in your magnanimity that you will take no advantage      of this open letter and frank confession. If he can obtain your      fellowship, he wants to come to Commerce as soon as he can. But if      he cannot be received into the fellowship of The Church, he must do      the best he can in banishment and exile.        Brethren, with you are the keys of the Kingdom; to you is power      given to \"exert your clemency, or display your vengeance.\" By      the former you will save a soul from death, and hide a multitude      of sins: by the latter you will forever discourage a returning      prodigal, cause sorrow without benefit, pain"]]]
