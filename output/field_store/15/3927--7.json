[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],[0,"The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#11)"],[1,"who are unemployed in this present emergency.  Our  social security legislation is an attempt to answer the first of  these questions; our Works Relief program, the second.    The program for social security now pending before the Congress is  a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the  government.  While our present and projected expenditures for work  relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national  credit resources, it is obvious that we cannot continue to create  governmental deficits for that purpose year after year.  We must  begin now to make provision for the future.  That is why our social  security program is an important part of the complete picture.  It  proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have  reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give  to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to  give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.    The unemployment insurance part of the legislation will not only  help to guard the individual in future periods of lay-off against  dependence upon relief, but it will, by sustaining purchasing  power, cushion the shock of economic distress.  Another helpful  feature of unemployment insurance is the incentive it will give to  employers to plan more carefully in order that unemployment may be  prevented by the stabilizing of employment itself.    Provisions for social security, however, are protections for the  future.  Our responsibility for the immediate necessities of the  unemployed has been met by the Congress through the most  comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation.  Our problem  is to put to work three and one-half million employable persons now  on the relief rolls.  It is a problem quite as much for private  industry as for the government.    We are losing no time getting the government's vast work relief  program underway, and we have every reason to believe that it  should be in full swing by autumn.  In directing it, I shall  recognize six fundamental principles:    (1) The projects should be useful.    (2) Projects shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of  the money spent will go into wages for labor.    (3) Projects will be sought which promise ultimate return to the  federal treasury of a considerable proportion of the costs.    (4) Funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly  spent and not held over until later years.    (5) In all cases projects must be of a character to give employment  to those on the relief rolls.    (6) Projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in  relation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas.    I next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work.    (1) I have set up a Division of Applications and Information to  which all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for  preliminary study and consideration.    (2) After the Division of Applications and Information has sifted  those projects, they will be sent to an Allotment Division composed  of representatives of the more important governmental agencies  charged with carrying on work relief projects.  The group will also  include representatives of cities, and of labor, farming, banking  and industry.  This Allotment Division will consider all of the  recommendations submitted to it and such projects as they approve  will be next submitted to the President who under the Act is  required to make final allocations.    (3) The next step will be to notify the proper government agency in  whose field the project falls, and also to notify another agency  which I am creating--a Progress Division.  This Division will have  the duty of coordinating the purchases of materials and supplies  and of making certain that people who are employed will be taken  from the relief rolls.  It will also have the responsibility of  determining work payments in various localities, of making full use  of existing employment services and to assist people engaged in  relief work to move as rapidly as possible back into private  employment when such employment is available.  Moreover, this  Division will be charged with keeping projects moving on schedule.    (4) I have felt it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid, so  far as possible, the creation of new governmental machinery for  supervising this work.  The national government now has at least  sixty different agencies with the staff and the experience and the  competence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three  hundred kinds of work that will be undertaken.  These agencies,  therefore, will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the  same sort of things that they have been doing.  This will make  certain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted  will be spent for actually creating new work and not for building  up expensive overhead organizations here in Washington.    For many months preparations have been under way.  The allotment of  funds for desirable projects has already begun.  The key men for the  major responsibilities of this great task already have been  selected.  I well realize that the country is expecting before this  year is out to see the \"dirt fly\", as they say, in carrying on the  work, and I assure my fellow citizens that no energy will be spared  in using these funds effectively to make a major attack upon the  problem of unemployment.    Our responsibility is to all of the people in this country.  This is  a great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness which is an  enemy of the human spirit generated by this depression.  Our attack  upon these enemies must be without stint and without  discrimination.  No sectional, no political distinctions can be  permitted.    It must, however, be recognized that when an enterprise of this  character is extended over more than three thousand counties  throughout the nation, there may be occasional instances of  inefficiency, bad management, or misuse of funds.  When cases of  this kind occur, there will be those, of course, who will try to  tell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the  entire endeavor.  It should be remembered that in every big job  there are some imperfections.  There are chiselers in every walk of  life; there are those in every industry who are guilty of unfair  practices; every profession has its black sheep, but long  experience in government has taught me that the exceptional  instances of wrong-doing in government are probably less numerous  than in almost every other line of endeavor.  The most effective  means of preventing such evils in this Works Relief program will be  the eternal vigilance of the American people themselves.  I call  upon my fellow citizens everywhere to cooperate with me in making  this the most efficient and the cleanest example of public  enterprise the world has ever seen.    It is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who  say that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient.  If you will  help, this can be done.  I, therefore, hope you will watch the work  in every corner of this Nation.  Feel free to criticize.  Tell me of  instances where work can be done better, or where improper  practices prevail.  Neither you nor I want criticism conceived in a  purely fault-finding or partisan spirit, but I am jealous of the  right of every citizen to call to the attention of his or her  government examples of how the public money can be more effectively  spent for the benefit of the American people.    I now come, my friends, to a part of the remaining business before  the Congress.  It has under consideration many measures which  provide for the rounding out of the program of economic and social  reconstruction with which we have been concerned for two years.  I  can mention only a few of them tonight, but I do not want my  mention of specific measures to be interpreted as lack of interest  in or disapproval of many other important proposals that are  pending.    The National Industrial Recovery Act expires on the sixteenth of  June.  After careful consideration, I have asked the Congress to  extend the life of this useful agency of government.  As we have  proceeded with the administration of this Act, we have found from  time to time more and more useful ways of promoting its purposes.  No reasonable person wants to abandon our present gains--we must  continue to protect children, to enforce minimum wages, to prevent  excessive hours, to safeguard, define and enforce collective  bargaining, and, while retaining fair competition, to eliminate so  far as humanly possible, the kinds of unfair practices by selfish  minorities which unfortunately did more than anything else to bring  about the recent collapse of industries.    There is likewise pending before the Congress legislation to  provide for the elimination of unnecessary holding companies in the  public utility field.    I consider this legislation a positive recovery measure.  Power  production in this country is virtually back to the 1929 peak.  The  operating companies in the gas and electric utility field are by  and large in good condition.  But under holding company domination  the utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself  and with public sentiment.  By far the greater part of the general  decline in utility securities had occurred before I was  inaugurated.  The absentee management of unnecessary holding company  control has lost touch with, and has lost the sympathy of, the  communities it pretends to serve.  Even more significantly it has  given the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of  overconcentrated economic power.    A business that loses the confidence of its customers and the good-  will of the public cannot long continue to be a good risk for the  investor.  This legislation will serve the investor by ending the  conditions which have caused that lack"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#11)"],[1," is all, my boy--and the letter was written about a year  ago!\"    \"But we'll go in search of him!\" put in Tom, quickly.  \"He may be  alive yet.\"    \"I thought I would go,\" answered Randolph Rover, \"and I thought,  possibly, that I might take Dick with me.\"    \"Oh, you must take me too!\" burst out Tom.  \"I could never bear to  be left behind.\"    \"And you must take me,\" interrupted Sam.  \"We always go together,  you know.\"    At this talk Randolph Rover was somewhat taken aback.  \"All!\" he  cried.  \"Why, what would three boys do in the heart of Africa?\"    \"Look for father!\" cried Tom.  \"I shan't stay behind--you can't  make me!\" he went on half defiantly.    \"We have been through lots of adventures, uncle, you know that,\"  came from Sam.  \"We are not afraid.\"    \"But the danger, boys--\" began the uncle.    \"What danger wouldn't we face for father's sake!\" said Tom.  \"I'd  go through fire and water for him.\"    \"You had better let us all go,\" said Dick.    \"If you don't let Tom and Sam go, why, the chances are they'll--\"    \"Run away and go anyway,\" finished Sam.    \"Oh, Uncle Randolph, say we can go; please do!\"    At this enthusiasm the uncle smiled sadly.    \"All-right, boys; as you are bound to have it so, you shall all  go.  But don't blame me if the perils are greater than you  anticipate, and if the undertaking costs one or more of you your  lives.\"          CHAPTER XII.    OFF FOR AFRICA      It was long after midnight before the conversation in relation to  the proposed trip to Africa came to an end.  Mrs. Rover insisted  that the boys should eat something, and they sat around the table  discussing the viands and the two letters at the same time.    \"Have you any idea where this Niwili Camp is?\" asked Dick of his  uncle.    \"It is on the Congo, but how far froth the mouth of that stream is  a question, lad.  Probably we can learn all about it when we reach  Boma, the capital of the Congo Free State.\"    \"The Congo is a pretty big stream, isn't it?\" questioned Sam.    \"Very large indeed.  At its mouth it is about ten miles wide, and  it is from twelve to fourteen hundred miles long.  Stanley traced  its course after an expedition in which he fought over thirty  battles with the natives.\"    \"They must be fearfully savage.\"    \"Those in the interior are.  The natives that live close to the  ocean are peaceable enough, so I have been told.\"    \"And how are we going to get there?\" asked Tom.  \"I don't suppose  there are any regular steamers running to the Congo.\"    \"No, indeed, Tom.  I have written to a shipping firm in New York  for information, and they will probably send word by morning,\" was  the answer.    It can well be imagined that the boys slept but little that night.  In the morning they telegraphed to Putnam Hall for their trunks,  and also let Captain Putnam and their chums know how matters  stood.  Then began preparations for such a tour as none of them  had ever before anticipated.    Word came from New York in the early afternoon mail, and the  information sent was highly satisfactory to Randolph Rover.  The  French steamer Republique was in port, loading for Boma and other  African ports, and would set sail on the coming Saturday.  The  firm had taken upon itself the responsibility to speak of passage  for Mr. Rover and one or two others.    \"Hurrah!\" cried Tom.  \"Uncle Randolph, you had better telegraph to  them at once for passage for the four of us.\"    \"I will,\" answered, Mr. Rover, and the telegram was sent within  the hour.    The next day was a busy one.  As but little in the way of outfits  could be procured in Oak Run or the adjoining villages, it was  decided that they should go down to New York on Thursday afternoon  and spend all of Friday in purchasing in the metropolis whatever  was needed.    The only person who was really sober was Mrs. Rover, for she hated  to see her husband start on such a journey, which was bound to, be  full of grave perils.    \"I am afraid you will never come back,\" she said, with tears in  her eyes.  \"And if you and Anderson are both dead to me, what will  I do?\"    \"Be brave, Martha,\" said Mr. Rover tenderly.  \"I feel certain that  a kind Providence will watch over us and bring us all back in  safety.\"    At last the party was ready to set off.  A fond good-by was said,  and away they rattled in the carryall for the railroad station at  Oak Run.    \"Good-by to home!\" shouted Tom, as he waved his cap to his aunt,  who stood beside the gateway.    \"And when we come back may we bring father with us,\" added Dick,  and Sam muttered an amen.    The journey down to New York was without incident, and as the  Rovers had lived in the metropolis for years they felt thoroughly  at home and knew exactly where to go for their outfit and suitable  clothing for use in such a warm country was procured, and in  addition each was armed with a revolver.  Mr. Rover also purchased  a shot-gun and a rifle, and likewise a number of cheap gold and  silver trinkets.    \"The natives are becoming civilized,\" he explained.  \"But, for all  that, I am certain a small gift now and then will go a long way  toward making friends.\"    The found that the Republique was a stanch-built steamer of eight  thousand tons burden.  Her captain, Jules Cambion, spoke English  quite fluently and soon made them feel at home.  He was much  interested in the story Randolph Rover had to tell concerning his  missing brother.    \"'Tis a strange happening, truly,\" he remarked.  \"I sincerely  trust that your search for him proves successful and that he  returns to the arms of his family unharmed.  But it is a fierce  country.  I have visited it twice, and I know.\"    \"I am glad to learn that you have been up the Congo,\" replied  Randolph Rover.  \"Perhaps during your leisure hours on the trip  you will not mind giving me such information as conics to your  mind.\"    \"I will tell you all I know willingly,\" answered Captain Cambion.    Exactly at noon on Saturday the Republique was ready to sail, and  with a shout from those on the wharf who had come to see the few  passengers off, she sheered away and started down the bay, past  Bedloe Island and the Statue of Liberty. Before night the shore  line had faded from view, and they were standing out boldly into  the Atlantic Ocean.    \"Off for Africa at last,\" murmured Sam, who had been standing at  the rail watching the last speck of land as it disappeared.  \"What  a big trip this is going to be!\"    \"Never mind how big it is, Sam,\" came from Tom,  \"if only it is  successful.\"    The first few days on board were spent in settling themselves.  The party had two connecting staterooms, and Mr. Rover and Sam  occupied one, while Dick and Tom had settled themselves in the  other.    The passengers were mostly French people, who were going to try  their fortunes in French Congo.  There was, however, one  Englishman, a man named Mortimer Blaze, who was bound out simply  for adventure.      \"I'm tired of England, and tired of America too,\" he explained.  \"I've hunted through the Rocky Mountains and up in Canada, as well  as at home, and now I'm going to try for a lion or a tiger in  Africa.\"    \"Perhaps the lion or tiger will try for you,\" smiled Tom.  \"What  then?\"    \"It will be a pitched battle, that's all,\" drawled Mortimer Blaze.  He was rather a sleepy looking man, but quick to act when the  occasion demanded.    The weather was all that could be wished, and during the first  week out the Republique made good progress.  On a steamer there  was but little for the boys to do, and they spent all of their  spare time in reading the books on Africa which Captain Cambion  had in his library, and which were printed in English. Often they  persuaded the genial captain to tell them of his adventures in  that far-away country.    \"You have many strange sights before you,\" he said to them one  day.  \"The strange vegetation, the immense trees, the wonderful  waterfalls, some larger than your own Niagara, and then the odd  people.  Some of the natives are little better than dwarfs, while  others are six feet and more in height and as straight as arrows.    \"Did you ever hear of this King Susko?\" questioned Tom.    \"Yes; I have heard of him several times.  He is known as the  Wanderer, because he and his tribe wander from place to place,  making war on the other tribes.\"    The captain knew nothing of Niwili Camp and expressed the opinion  that it had been, like many other camps, only a temporary affair.  He said that the best the party could do was to strike straight up  the Congo, along the south shore, and question the different  natives met concerning King Susko's present whereabouts.    On the beginning of the second week a storm was encountered which  lasted for three days.  At first the wind blew at a lively rate,  and this was followed by thunder and lightning and a regular  deluge of rain, which made all of the boys stay below.  The  steamer pitched from side to side and more than one wave broke  over her decks.    \"This is the worse storm I ever saw,\" remarked Dick, as he held  fast to a chair in the cabin.  \"They won't be able to set any  table for dinner today.\"    \"Dinner!\" came from Sam, with a groan.    \"Who wants any dinner, when a fellow feels as if he was going to  be turned inside out!\"  So far none of the boys had suffered from  seasickness, but now poor Sam was catching it, and the youngest  Rover felt thoroughly miserable.    \"Never mind, the storm won't last forever,\" said Dick  sympathetically.  \"Perhaps you had better lie down, Sam.\"    \"How can I, with the ship tossing like a cork?  I've got to hold  on, same as the rest, and be glad, I suppose, that I am alive,\"  and poor Sam looked utterly miserable.    It was very close in the cabin, but neither door nor port-hole  could be opened for fear of the water coming in.  Dinner was a  farce, to use Tom's way of expressing it, for everything was cold  and had to be eaten out of hand or from a tin cup. "]]]
