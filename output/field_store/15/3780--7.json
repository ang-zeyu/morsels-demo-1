God       frowned, while she smiled; God chastised, but she forgave;       this last notion was by no means a strange one. It is accepted       with almost absolute faith among the laboring classes of the       rural parts of Spain.\"--GALDOS: _Marianela_.      Holy week throngs Seville to overflowing. The devout no longer scourge  themselves in public, sprinkling the pavements with their blood, but  Spaniards flock from all Andalusia, from Madrid, and even from the  northern provinces to the sunny city on the storied Guadalquivir.  Hotel charges run from twelve dollars a day up to incredible figures;  a mere bed in a lodging house costs its three dollars, four dollars,  or five dollars a night, and fortunate are those who enjoy the  hospitality of a private home.    The ceremonies opened Sunday morning with the procession of palms. We  had been told by our cathedral guide the day before that this  procession would take place at seven or half-past seven at the latest,  and had asked the maid to call us at half-past six. As the chiming  bells should have warned us, her knock was an hour tardy, but when,  breakfastless and eager, we reached the cathedral a few minutes after  eight, there was as yet no sign of a procession. Mass was being said  in the Sagrario and in several chapels, and the morning light poured  in through the rich-colored windows upon groups of kneeling figures  before every shrine. The women wore black mantillas, for, although  this most graceful of headdresses is losing credit on the fashionable  promenades of Seville, and is almost never seen in open carriages,  Holy Week demands it of all the faithful.    We asked a white-robed young chorister when the procession would form.  He answered with encouraging precision, \"In twenty minutes.\" We roamed  about for a half hour or more through those majestic spaces, beneath  those soaring arches, aspiration wrought in stone, until by chance in  that shifting multitude we came face to face with our guide of the day  before. We asked how soon the procession would form. He said, \"In  twenty minutes,\" and we went home for coffee.    When we returned the procession was streaming out of the cathedral  into the street of the _Gran Capitan_. It was simple and all the more  attractive for that simplicity. The colors of standards and vestments  were mainly purple and gold, and the long, yellow fronds of palm,  blown by the fresh breeze from the river, gleamed brighter than the  sheen of candle or of mitre. Turning the corner, the procession, now  facing the beautiful Giralda, entered by the ample Door of Pardon,  still incrusted with its Arabic decorations, into the Court of  Oranges, whose ripe fruit gave new touches of gold to the picture.    Venders of palm were stationed in every sheltered corner, selling  their wares, more than twice the height of a man, at fifteen cents  the frond, while boys, darting about with armfuls of olive, were glad  to take a cent the branch, and not have the best of their leafy store  filched from them by sly old women, more intent, like the rest of us,  on getting a blessing than deserving it.    Through the multitude the glittering palms and purple robes swept on  back into the cathedral, where the silent and remote archbishop, an  image of gold in his splendid apparel, shed his benediction not only  over the proud palms, but over every spray of \"little gray leaves,\"  like those of Gethsemane. These blessed palms, sprinkled with holy  water and wafting strange fragrances of incense, would be carried home  and kept in myriad balconies all the year through, to protect the  house from \"the all-dreaded thunder-stone.\"    That Sunday afternoon at five o'clock we were leaning out expectantly  from our host's best balcony. With the constant Spanish courtesy, he  had betaken himself, with the children of the household, to a less  commanding balcony below, and his eldest son had considerately  withdrawn, accompanied by his fiancee, to a mere speck of a balcony  above. This left a dozen of us, Spanish, English, and American, to  enjoy as good a view as the city afforded of the processional  tableaux.    The oblong _Plaza de la Constitucion_, the scene in days gone by of  many a tournament, _auto de fe_, and bull-fight, is bounded on one  side by the ornate Renaissance facade of the city hall, and on the  other, in part, by the plain front of the court-house, before which  criminals used to be done to death. Private dwellings, with their  tiers of balconies, one of which had fallen to our happy lot, cross  the wider end of the _plaza_, while the other opens into the brilliant  street of _Las Sierpes_, too narrow for carriages, but boasting the  gayest shop windows and merriest cafes of all the town.    The _plaza_, always animated, fairly rippled with excitement this Palm  Sunday afternoon. The grand stand, erected in front of the city hall,  was filled, although many of the camp-chairs and benches placed in  thick-set rows on the farther side of the line of march were not yet  rented. Thursday and Friday are the days that draw the multitudes. The  crowd was bright with uniforms, most conspicuous being the spruce  white-edged, three-cornered hats and dark-blue, red-faced coats of the  civil guard. Venders of peanuts, peanut candy, macaroons, caramels,  and all manner of _dulces_ swung their baskets from one sweet-toothed  Spaniard to another, while wisely the water-seller went in their wake,  with the artistic yellow jar over his shoulder. One young pedler was  doing a flourishing business in crabs, the customers receiving these  delicacies in outstretched pocket handkerchiefs.    Busy as our eyes were kept, we were able to lend ear to the  explanations of our Spanish friends, who told us that the church  dignitaries, after the procession of palms, took no official part in  the shows of Passion Week, although many of the clergy belonged, as  individuals, to the religious brotherhoods concerned. The church  reserves its street displays for Corpus Christi. These brotherhoods,  societies of ancient origin, and connected with some church or chapel,  own dramatic properties often of great intrinsic value and  considerable antiquity.    For days before Holy Week one may see the members busy in the churches  at the task of arranging groups of sacred figures, vested as richly as  possible in garments of silk and velvet, with ornaments of jewels and  gold, on platforms so heavy that twenty-five men, at the least, are  needed to carry each. These litters are escorted through the principal  streets and squares of the city by their respective societies, each  brotherhood having its distinctive dress. It is customary for every  _cofradia_ to present two pageants--the first in honor of Christ; the  second, and more important, in honor of Mary, to whom chivalrous Spain  has always rendered supreme homage; but sometimes the two tableaux are  combined into one.    After long watching and waiting we saw, far down _Las Sierpes_, the  coming of the first procession. A line of police marched in advance to  clear the road. Then appeared a loosely ordered company of fantastic  figures in blue capes and blue peaked caps, absurdly high and reaching  down to the shoulder, with holes cut for the eyes. From beneath the  capes flowed white frocks, and the gloves and sandals were white.  These \"Nazarenes,\" who looked like a survival of the Carnival,  conducted in silence a litter upon which was erected an image of the  crucified Christ, with face uplifted as if in prayer.    The pageant halted before the doors of the city hall to greet the  Alcalde, who rose from his red velvet chair and bared his head. Men  uncovered, and people stood all along the route, but acclamations were  reserved for Our Lady of the Star. Her attendant troop was dressed  like the preceding, with a star embroidered in white on the shoulder  of the blue tunic. Her litter was ablaze with candles and laden with  flowers; her outsweeping train was upborne by four little pages, and a  brass band followed her with unceasing music.      [Illustration: FILLING THE WATER-JARS]    Sunset colors were in the sky before the procession of the second  brotherhood arrived. At last, far down the _Sierpes_, the dusk was  dotted with the gleam of many tapers, and above these, most impressive  in the dim distance, glimmered a white figure high upon the cross. As  the pageant drew near, waves of incense rolled out upon the air. The  crash of trumpets and deep boom of drums announced that Our Lady of  the Angels was advancing upon the same platform with her Son, for  music in these Passion Week processions is always a sign of the  presence of the Virgin. The brothers of this retinue wore black, save  that their peaked caps were purple.    As twilight gathered, a company of strange dark shapes bore past in  solemn hush the Most Holy Christ of the Waters. The Saviour hung upon  the cross, an angel receiving in a golden cup the blood from his  wounded side. Then her great banner of white and blue heralded the  approach of Our Lady of the Utter Grief, who passed with her  accustomed pomp of lights and music, holding to her eyes a  handkerchief said to be of the most exquisite lace.    Night had fallen when, at eight o'clock, a maid left on vigil called  us all from the dinner table to see the beautiful procession of  white-robed figures conducting Our Father Jesus of the Silence. The  figure of Christ, resplendent in gold and purple, stood before Herod,  whose mail-clad soldiers guarded the prisoner. The Roman costumes were  so well copied, and all the postures and groupings so startlingly  natural, that _vivas_ went up all along the crowded square. As the  banner of the Virgin saluted the Alcalde, her attendants let fall  their long white trains, which swept out quite six yards behind,  reaching from one brother to the next and yielding a wonderfully fine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#11)"],[1,"and beautiful,  and was caressingly fond of him, but because he had won her in fair  mortal combat with the younger and showier Knave.    For a time after Knave's routing, Lad was blissfully happy in Lady's  undivided comradeship. Together they ranged the forests beyond The  Place in search of rabbits. Together they sprawled shoulder to  shoulder on the disreputable old fur rug in front of the living-room  fire. Together they did joyous homage to their gods, the Mistress and  the Master.    Then in the late summer a new rival appeared--to be accurate, three  rivals. And they took up all of Lady's time and thought and love. Poor  old Lad was made to feel terribly out in the cold. The trio of rivals  that had so suddenly claimed Lady's care were fuzzy and roly-poly, and  about the size of month-old kittens. In brief, they were three  thoroughbred collie puppies.    Two of them were tawny brown, with white forepaws and chests. The  third was not like Lad in color, but like the mother--at least, all of  him not white was of the indeterminate yellowish mouse-gray which, at  three months or earlier, turns to pale gold.    When they were barely a fortnight old--almost as soon as their big  mournful eyes opened--the two brown puppies died. There seemed no  particular reason for their death, except the fact that a collie is  always the easiest or else the most impossible breed of dog to raise.    The fuzzy grayish baby alone was left--the puppy which was soon to  turn to white and gold. The Mistress named him \"Wolf.\"    Upon Baby Wolf the mother-dog lavished a ridiculous lot of attention--so  much that Lad was miserably lonely. The great collie would try  with pathetic eagerness, a dozen times a day, to lure his mate  into a woodland ramble or into a romp on the lawn, but Lady met  his wistful advances with absorbed indifference or with a snarl.  Indeed when Lad ventured overnear the fuzzy baby, he was warned  off by a querulous growl from the mother or by a slash of her shiny  white teeth.    Lad could not at all understand it. He felt no particular interest--only  a mild and disapproving curiosity--in the shapeless little whimpering  ball of fur that nestled so helplessly against his beloved mate's  side. He could not understand the mother-love that kept Lady with  Wolf all day and all night. It was an impulse that meant nothing  to Lad.    After a week or two of fruitless effort to win back Lady's interest,  Lad coldly and wretchedly gave up the attempt. He took long solitary  walks by himself in the forest, retired for hours at a time to sad  brooding in his favorite \"cave\" under the living-room piano, and tried  to console himself by spending all the rest of his day in the company  of the Mistress and the Master. And he came thoroughly to disapprove  of Wolf. Recognizing the baby intruder as the cause of Lady's  estrangement from himself, he held aloof from the puppy.    The latter was beginning to emerge from his newborn shapelessness. His  coat's texture was changing from fuzz to silk. Its color was turning  from gray into yellow. His blunt little nose was lengthening and  growing thin and pointed. His butter-ball body was elongating, and his  huge feet and legs were beginning to shape up. He looked more like a  dog now, and less like an animated muff. Also within Wolf's youthful  heart awoke the devil of mischief, the keen urge of play. He found  Lady a pleasant-enough playfellow up to a certain point. But a  painfully sharp pinch from her teeth or a reproving and breath-taking  slap from one of her forepaws was likely to break up every game that  she thought had gone far enough; when Wolf's clownish roughness at  length got on her hair-trigger nerves.    So, in search of an additional playmate, the frolicsome puppy turned  to Lad, only to find that Lad would not play with him at all. Lad  made it very, very clear to everyone--except to the fool puppy  himself--that he had no desire to romp or to associate in any way with  this creature which had ousted him from Lady's heart! Being cursed  with a soul too big and gentle to let him harm anything so helpless as  Wolf, he did not snap or growl, as did Lady, when the puppy teased. He  merely walked away in hurt dignity.    Wolf had a positive genius for tormenting Lad. The huge collie, for  instance, would be snoozing away a hot hour on the veranda or under  the wistaria vines. Down upon him, from nowhere in particular, would  pounce Wolf.    The puppy would seize his sleeping father by the ear, and drive his  sharp little milk-teeth fiercely into the flesh. Then he would brace  himself and pull backward, possibly with the idea of dragging Lad  along the ground.    Lad would wake in pain, would rise in dignified unhappiness to his  feet and start to walk off--the puppy still hanging to his ear. As  Wolf was a collie and not a bulldog, he would lose his grip as his fat  little body left the ground. Then, at a clumsy gallop, he would pursue  Lad, throwing himself against his father's forelegs and nipping the  slender ankles. All this was torture to Lad, and dire mortification  too--especially if humans chanced to witness the scene. Yet never did  he retaliate; he simply got out of the way.    Lad, nowadays, used to leave half his dinner uneaten, and he took to  moping in a way that is not good for dog or man. For the moping had in  it no ill-temper--nothing but heartache at his mate's desertion, and a  weary distaste for the puppy's annoying antics. It was bad enough for  Wolf to have supplanted him in Lady's affection, without also making  his life a burden and humiliating him in the eyes of his gods.    Therefore Lad moped. Lady remained nervously fussy over her one  child. And Wolf continued to be a lovable, but unmitigated, pest. The  Mistress and the Master tried in every way to make up to Lad for the  positive and negative afflictions he was enduring, but the sorrowing  dog's unhappiness grew with the days.    Then one November morning Lady met Wolf's capering playfulness with a  yell of rage so savage as to send the puppy scampering away in mortal  terror, and to bring the Master out from his study on a run. For no  normal dog gives that hideous yell except in racking pain or in  illness; and mere pain could not wring such a sound from a thoroughbred.    The Master called Lady over to him. Sullenly she obeyed, slinking up  to him in surly unwillingness. Her nose was hot and dry; her soft  brown eyes were glazed, their whites a dull red. Her dense coat was  tumbled.    After a quick examination, the Master shut her into a kennel-room and  telephoned for a veterinary.    \"She is sickening for the worst form of distemper,\" reported the vet'  an hour later, \"perhaps for something worse. Dogs seldom get distemper  after they're a year old, but when they do it's dangerous. Better let  me take her over to my hospital and isolate her there. Distemper runs  through a kennel faster than cholera through a plague-district. I may  be able to cure her in a month or two--or I may not. Anyhow, there's  no use in risking your other dogs' lives by leaving her here.\"    So it was that Lad saw his dear mate borne away from him in the  tonneau of a strange man's car.    Lady hated to go. She whimpered and hung back as the vet' lifted her  aboard. At sound of her whimper Lad started forward, head low, lips  writhing back from his clenched teeth, his shaggy throat vibrant with  growls. At a sharp word of command from the Master, he checked his  onset and stood uncertain. He looked at his departing mate, his dark  eyes abrim with sorrow, then glanced at the Master in an agony of  appeal.    \"It's all right, Laddie,\" the Master tried to console him, stroking  the dog's magnificent head as he spoke. \"It's all right. It's the only  chance of saving her.\"    Lad did not grasp the words, but their tone was reassuring. It told  him, at least, that this kidnaping was legal and must not be  prevented. Sorrowfully he watched the chugging car out of sight, up  the drive. Then with a sigh he walked heavily back to his \"cave\"  beneath the piano.    Lad, alone of The Place's dogs, was allowed to sleep in the house at  night, and even had free access to that dog-forbidden spot, the  dining-room. Next morning, as soon as the doors were opened, he dashed  out in search of Lady. With some faint hope that she might have been  brought back in the night, he ransacked every corner of The Place for  her.    He did not find Lady. But Wolf very promptly found Lad. Wolf was  lonely, too--terribly lonely. He had just spent the first solitary  night of his three-month life. He missed the furry warm body into  whose shelter he had always cuddled for sleep. He missed his  playmate--the pretty mother who had been his fond companion.    There are few things so mournful as the eyes of even the happiest  collie pup; this morning, loneliness had intensified the melancholy  expression in Wolf's eyes. But at sight of Lad, the puppy gamboled  forward with a falsetto bark of joy. The world was not quite empty,  after all. Though his mother had cruelly absented herself, here was a  playfellow that was better than nothing. And up to Lad frisked the  optimistic little chap.    Lad saw him coming. The older dog halted and instinctively turned  aside to avoid the lively little nuisance. Then, halfway around, he  stopped and turned back to face the puppy.    Lady was gone--gone, perhaps, forever. And all that was left to remind  Lad of her was this bumptious and sharp-toothed little son of hers.  Lady had loved the youngster--Lady, whom Lad so loved. Wolf alone was  left; and Wolf was in some mysterious way a part of Lady.    So, instead of making his escape as the pest cantered toward him, Lad  stood where he was. Wolf bounded upward and as usual nipped merrily  at one of Lad's ears. Lad did not shake off his tormentor and stalk  away. In spite of the pain to the sensitive flesh, he remained  quiet, looking down at"]]]
