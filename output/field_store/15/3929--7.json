There is this of romance about lunch, that one can imagine great  adventures with stockbrokers, actor-managers, publishers, and  other demigods to have had their birth at the luncheon table. If  it is a question of \"bulling\" margarine or \"bearing\" boot-polish,  if the name for the new play is still unsettled, if there is some  idea of an American edition--whatever the emergency, the final  word on the subject is always the same, \"Come and have lunch with  me, and we'll talk it over\"; and when the waiter has taken your  hat and coat, and you have looked diffidently at the menu, and in  reply to your host's question, \"What will you drink?\" have made  the only possible reply, \"Oh, anything that you're drinking\"  (thus showing him that you don't insist on a bottle to yourself)-  -THEN you settle down to business, and the history of England is  enlarged by who can say how many pages.    And not only does one inaugurate business matters at lunch, but  one also renews old friendships. Who has not had said to him in  the Strand, \"Hallo, old fellow, I haven't seen you for ages; you  must come and lunch with me one day\"? And who has not answered,  \"Rather! I should love to,\" and passed on with a glow at the  heart which has not died out until the next day, when the  incident is forgotten? An invitation to dinner is formal, to tea  unnecessary, to breakfast impossible, but there is a casualness,  very friendly and pleasant, about invitations to lunch which make  them complete in themselves, and in no way dependent on any lunch  which may or may not follow.    Without having exhausted the subject of lunch in London (and I  should like to say that it is now certain that I shall not have  time to partake to-day), let us consider for a moment lunch in  the country. I do not mean lunch in the open air, for it is  obvious that there is no meal so heavenly as lunch thus eaten,  and in a short article like this I have no time in which to dwell  upon the obvious. I mean lunch at a country house. Now, the most  pleasant feature of lunch at a country house is this--that you  may sit next to whomsoever you please. At dinner she may be  entrusted to quite the wrong man; at breakfast you are faced with  the problem of being neither too early for her nor yet too late  for a seat beside her; at tea people have a habit of taking your  chair at the moment when a simple act of courtesy has drawn you  from it in search of bread and butter; but at lunch you follow  her in and there you are--fixed.    But there is a place, neither London nor the country, which  brings out more than any other place all that is pleasant in  lunch. It was really the recent experience of this which set me  writing about lunch. Lunch in the train! It should be the \"second  meal\"--about 1.30-- because then you are really some distance  from London and are hungry. The panorama flashes by outside,  nearer and nearer comes the beautiful West; you cross rivers and  hurry by little villages, you pass slowly and reverently through  strange old towns ... and, inside, the waiter leaves the potatoes  next to you and slips away.    Well, it is his own risk. Here goes. ... What I say is that, if a  man really likes potatoes, he must be a pretty decent sort of  fellow.          The Friend of Man      When swords went out of fashion, walking-sticks, I suppose, came  into fashion. The present custom has its advantages. Even in his  busiest day the hero's sword must have returned at times to its  scabbard, and what would he do then with nothing in his right  hand? But our walking-sticks have no scabbards. We grasp them  always, ready at any moment to summon a cab, to point out a view,  or to dig an enemy in the stomach. Meanwhile we slash the air in  defiance of the world.    My first stick was a malacca, silver at the collar and polished  horn as to the handle. For weeks it looked beseechingly at me  from a shop window, until a lucky birthday tip sent me in after  it. We went back to school together that afternoon, and if  anything can lighten the cloud which hangs over the last day of  holidays, it is the glory of some such stick as mine. Of course  it was too beautiful to live long; yet its death became it. I had  left many a parental umbrella in the train unhonoured and unsung.  My malacca was mislaid in an hotel in Norway. And even now when  the blinds are drawn and we pull up our chairs closer round the  wood fire, what time travellers tell to awestruck stay-at-homes  tales of adventure in distant lands, even now if by a lucky  chance Norway is mentioned, I tap the logs carelessly with the  poker and drawl, \"I suppose you didn't happen to stay at  Vossvangen? I left a malacca cane there once. Rather a good one  too.\" So that there is an impression among my friends that there  is hardly a town in Europe but has had its legacy from me. And  this I owe to my stick.    My last is of ebony, ivory-topped. Even though I should spend  another fortnight abroad I could not take this stick with me. It  is not a stick for the country; its heart is in Piccadilly.  Perhaps it might thrive in Paris if it could stand the sea  voyage. But no, I cannot see it crossing the Channel; in a cap I  am no companion for it. Could I step on to the boat in a silk hat  and then retire below--but I am always unwell below, and that  would not suit its dignity. It stands now in a corner of my room  crying aloud to be taken to the opera. I used to dislike men who  took canes to Covent Garden, but I see now how it must have been  with them. An ebony stick topped with ivory has to be humoured.  Already I am considering a silk-lined cape, and it is settled  that my gloves are to have black stitchings.    Such is my last stick, for it was given to me this very morning.  At my first sight of it I thought that it might replace the  common one which I lost in an Easter train. That was silly of me.  I must have a stick of less gentle birth which is not afraid to  be seen with a soft hat. It must be a stick which I can drop, or  on occasion kick; one with which I can slash dandelions; one for  which, when ultimately I leave it in a train, conscience does not  drag me to Scotland Yard. In short, a companionable stick for a  day's journey; a country stick.    The ideal country stick will never be found. It must be thick  enough to stand much rough usage of a sort which I will explain  presently, and yet it must be thin so that it makes a pleasant  whistling sound through the air. Its handle must be curved so  that it can pull down the spray of blossom of which you are in  need, or pull up the luncheon basket which you want even more  badly, and yet it must be straight so that you can drive an old  golf ball with it. It must be unadorned, so that it shall lack  ostentation, and yet it must have a band, so that when you throw  stones at it you can count two if you hit the silver. You begin  to see how difficult it is to achieve the perfect stick.    Well, each one of us must let go those properties which his own  stick can do best without. For myself I insist on this--my stick  must be good for hitting and good to hit with. A stick, we are  agreed, is something to have in the hand when walking. But there  are times when we sit down; and if our journey shall have taken  us to the beach, our stick must at once be propped in the sand  while from a suitable distance we throw stones at it. However  beautiful the sea, its beauty can only be appreciated properly in  this fashion. Scenery must not be taken at a gulp; we must absorb  it unconsciously. With the mind gently exercised as to whether we  scored a two on the band or a one just below it, and with the  muscles of the arm at stretch, we are in a state ideally  receptive of beauty.    And, for my other essential of a country stick, it must be  possible to grasp it by the wrong end and hit a ball with it. So  it must have no ferrule, and the handle must be heavy and  straight. In this way was golf born; its creator roamed the  fields after his picnic lunch, knocking along the cork from his  bottle. At first he took seventy-nine from the gate in one field  to the oak tree in the next; afterwards fifty-four. Then suddenly  he saw the game. We cannot say that he was no lover of Nature.  The desire to knock a ball about, to play silly games with a  stick, comes upon a man most keenly when he is happy; let it be  ascribed that he is happy to the streams and the hedges and the  sunlight through the trees. And so let my stick have a handle  heavy and straight, and let there be no ferrule on the end. Be  sure that I have an old golf ball in my pocket.    In London one is not so particular. Chiefly we want a stick for  leaning on when we are talking to an acquaintance suddenly met.  After the initial \"Hulloa!\" and the discovery that we have  nothing else of importance to say, the situation is distinctly  eased by the remembrance of our stick. It gives us a support  moral and physical, such as is supplied in a drawing-room by a  cigarette. For this purpose size and shape are immaterial. Yet  this much is essential--it must not be too slippery, or in our  nervousness we may drop it altogether. My ebony stick with the  polished ivory top--    But I have already decided that my ebony stick is out of place  with the everyday hat. It stands in its corner waiting for the  opera season, I must get another stick for rough work.          The Diary Habit      A newspaper has been lamenting the decay of the diary-keeping  habit, with the natural result that several correspondents have  written to say that they have kept diaries all their lives. No  doubt all these diaries now contain the entry, \"Wrote to the  Daily ---- to deny the assertion that the diary-keeping habit is  on the wane.\" Of such little things are diaries made.    I suppose this is the reason why diaries are so rarely kept  nowadays--that nothing ever happens to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#11)"],[1,"y, it seemed from nowhere, a small piece of paper  fluttered from out the assembly and alighted on the desk in front of the  Public Prosecutor. He took the paper up and glanced at its contents. I  saw that his cheeks had paled, and that his hand trembled as he handed  the paper over to me.\"    \"And what did that paper contain, citizen Marat?\" asked Bibot, also  speaking in a whisper, for an access of superstitious terror was  gripping him by the throat.    \"Just the well-known accursed device, citizen, the small scarlet flower,  drawn in red ink, and the few words: 'To-night the innocent men and  women now condemned by this infamous tribunal will be beyond your  reach!'\"    \"And no sign of a messenger?\"    \"None.\"    \"And when did----\"    \"Hush!\" said Marat peremptorily, \"no more of that now. To your post,  citizen, and remember--all are suspect! let none escape!\"    The two men had been sitting outside a small tavern, opposite the Porte  Montmartre, with a bottle of wine between them, their elbows resting on  the grimy top of a rough wooden table. They had talked in whispers, for  even the walls of the tumble-down cabaret might have had ears.    Opposite them the city wall--broken here by the great gate of  Montmartre--loomed threateningly in the fast-gathering dusk of this  winter's afternoon. Men in ragged red shirts, their unkempt heads  crowned with Phrygian caps adorned with a tricolour cockade, lounged  against the wall, or sat in groups on the top of piles of refuse that  littered the street, with a rough deal plank between them and a greasy  pack of cards in their grimy fingers. Guns and bayonets were propped  against the wall. The gate itself had three means of egress; each of  these was guarded by two men with fixed bayonets at their shoulders, but  otherwise dressed like the others, in rags--with bare legs that looked  blue and numb in the cold--the sans-culottes of revolutionary Paris.    Bibot rose from his seat, nodding to Marat, and joined his men.    From afar, but gradually drawing nearer, came the sound of a ribald  song, with chorus accompaniment sung by throats obviously surfeited with  liquor.    For a moment--as the sound approached--Bibot turned back once more to  the Friend of the People.    \"Am I to understand, citizen,\" he said, \"that my orders are not to let  anyone pass through these gates to-night?\"    \"No, no, citizen,\" replied Marat, \"we dare not do that. There are a  number of good patriots in the city still. We cannot interfere with  their liberty or--\"    And the look of fear of the demagogue--himself afraid of the human  whirlpool which he has let loose--stole into Marat's cruel, piercing  eyes.    \"No, no,\" he reiterated more emphatically, \"we cannot disregard the  passports issued by the Committee of Public Safety. But examine each  passport carefully, citizen Bibot! If you have any reasonable ground for  suspicion, detain the holder, and if you have not----\"    The sound of singing was quite near now. With another wink and a final  leer, Marat drew back under the shadow of the cabaret, and Bibot  swaggered up to the main entrance of the gate.    \"Qui va la?\" he thundered in stentorian tones as a group of some  half-dozen people lurched towards him out of the gloom, still shouting  hoarsely their ribald drinking song.    The foremost man in the group paused opposite citizen Bibot, and with  arms akimbo, and legs planted well apart tried to assume a rigidity of  attitude which apparently was somewhat foreign to him at this moment.    \"Good patriots, citizen,\" he said in a thick voice which he vainly tried  to render steady.    \"What do you want?\" queried Bibot.    \"To be allowed to go on our way unmolested.\"    \"What is your way?\"    \"Through the Porte Montmartre to the village of Barency.\"    \"What is your business there?\"    This query delivered in Bibot's most pompous manner seemed vastly to  amuse the rowdy crowd. He who was the spokesman turned to his friends  and shouted hilariously:    \"Hark at him, citizens! He asks me what is our business. Oh, citizen  Bibot, since when have you become blind? A dolt you've always been, else  you had not asked the question.\"    But Bibot, undeterred by the man's drunken insolence, retorted gruffly:    \"Your business, I want to know.\"    \"Bibot! my little Bibot!\" cooed the bibulous orator now in dulcet tones,  \"dost not know us, my good Bibot? Yet we all know thee, citizen--Captain  Bibot of the Town Guard, eh, citizens! Three cheers for the citizen  captain!\"    When the noisy shouts and cheers from half a dozen hoarse throats had  died down, Bibot, without more ado, turned to his own men at the gate.    \"Drive these drunken louts away!\" he commanded; \"no one is allowed to  loiter here.\"    Loud protest on the part of the hilarious crowd followed, then a slight  scuffle with the bayonets of the Town Guard. Finally the spokesman,  somewhat sobered, once more appealed to Bibot.    \"Citizen Bibot! you must be blind not to know me and my mates! And let  me tell you that you are doing yourself a deal of harm by interfering  with the citizens of the Republic in the proper discharge of their  duties, and by disregarding their rights of egress through this gate, a  right confirmed by passports signed by two members of the Committee of  Public Safety.\"    He had spoken now fairly clearly and very pompously. Bibot, somewhat  impressed and remembering Marat's admonitions, said very civilly:    \"Tell me your business then, citizen, and show me your passports. If  everything is in order you may go your way.\"    \"But you know me, citizen Bibot?\" queried the other.    \"Yes, I know you--unofficially, citizen Durand.\"    \"You know that I and the citizens here are the carriers for citizen  Legrand, the market gardener of Barency?\"    \"Yes, I know that,\" said Bibot guardedly, \"unofficially.\"    \"Then, unofficially, let me tell you, citizen, that unless we get to  Barency this evening, Paris will have to do without cabbages and  potatoes to-morrow. So now you know that you are acting at your own risk  and peril, citizen, by detaining us.\"    \"Your passports, all of you,\" commanded Bibot.    He had just caught sight of Marat still sitting outside the tavern  opposite, and was glad enough, in this instance, to shelve his  responsibility on the shoulders of the popular \"Friend of the People.\"  There was general searching in ragged pockets for grimy papers with  official seals thereon, and whilst Bibot ordered one of his men to take  the six passports across the road to citizen Marat for his inspection,  he himself, by the last rays of the setting winter sun, made close  examination of the six men who desired to pass through the Porte  Montmartre.    As the spokesman had averred, he--Bibot--knew every one of these men.  They were the carriers to citizen Legrand, the Barency market gardener.  Bibot knew every face. They passed with a load of fruit and vegetables  in and out of Paris every day. There was really and absolutely no cause  for suspicion, and when citizen Marat returned the six passports,  pronouncing them to be genuine, and recognising his own signature at the  bottom of each, Bibot was at last satisfied, and the six bibulous  carriers were allowed to pass through the gate, which they did, arm in  arm, singing a wild curmagnole, and vociferously cheering as they  emerged out into the open.    But Bibot passed an unsteady hand over his brow. It was cold, yet he was  in a perspiration. That sort of thing tells on a man's nerves. He  rejoined Marat, at the table outside the drinking booth, and ordered a  fresh bottle of wine.    The sun had set now, and with the gathering dusk a damp mist descended  on Montmartre. From the wall opposite, where the men sat playing cards,  came occasional volleys of blasphemous oaths. Bibot was feeling much  more like himself. He had half forgotten the incident of the six  carriers, which had occurred nearly half an hour ago.    Two or three other people had, in the meanwhile, tried to pass through  the gates, but Bibot had been suspicious and had detained them all.    Marat having commended him for his zeal took final leave of him. Just as  the demagogue's slouchy, grimy figure was disappearing down a side  street there was the loud clatter of hoofs from that same direction, and  the next moment a detachment of the mounted Town Guard, headed by an  officer in uniform, galloped down the ill-paved street.    Even before the troopers had drawn rein the officer had hailed Bibot.    \"Citizen,\" he shouted, and his voice was breathless, for he had  evidently ridden hard and fast, \"this message to you from the citizen  Chief Commissary of the Section. Six men are wanted by the Committee of  Public Safety. They are disguised as carriers in the employ of a market  gardener, and have passports for Barency!... The passports are stolen:  the men are traitors--escaped aristocrats--and their spokesman is that  d--d Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.\"    Bibot tried to speak; he tugged at the collar of his ragged shirt; an  awful curse escaped him.    \"Ten thousand devils!\" he roared.    \"On no account allow these people to go through,\" continued the officer.  \"Keep their passports. Detain them!... Understand?\"    Bibot was still gasping for breath even whilst the officer, ordering a  quick \"Turn!\" reeled his horse round, ready to gallop away as far as he  had come.    \"I am for the St. Denis Gate--Grosjean is on guard there!\" he shouted.  \"Same orders all round the city. No one to leave the gates!...  Understand?\"    His troopers fell in. The next moment he would be gone, and those cursed  aristocrats well in safety's way.    \"Citizen Captain!\"    The hoarse shout at last contrived to escape Bibot's parched throat. As  if involuntarily, the officer drew rein once more.    \"What is it? Quick!--I've no time. That confounded Englishman may be at  the St. Denis Gate even now!\"    \"Citizen Captain,\" gasped Bibot, his breath coming"]]]
