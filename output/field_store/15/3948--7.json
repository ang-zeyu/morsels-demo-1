Is that so?\"    \"It is so, if not completely so. There are the poor men and humble--the  pashas and judges and the others of the Medjidie, as thee said, are not  poor. But such as the orderly yonder--\" He paused meditatively.    Lacey looked at David with profound respect. \"You make the poorest your  partners, your friends. I see, I see. Jerusalem, that's masterly! I  admire you. It's a new way in this country.\" Then, after a moment:  \"It'll do--by golly, it'll do! Not a bit more costly, and you do some  good with it. Yes--it--will--do.\"    \"I have given no man money save in charity and for proper service done  openly,\" said David, a little severely.    \"Say--of course. And that's just what isn't done here. Everything goes  to him who hath, and from him who hath not is taken away even that which  he hath. One does the work and another gets paid--that's the way here.  But you, Mr. Claridge, you clinch with the strong man at the top, and,  down below, you've got as your partners the poor man, whose name is  Legion. If you get a fall out of the man at the top, you're solid with  the Legion. And if the man at the top gets up again and salaams and  strokes your hand, and says, 'Be my brother,' then it's a full Nile,  and the fig-tree putteth forth its tender branches, and the date-palm  flourisheth, and at the village pond the thanksgiving turkey gobbles and  is glad. 'Selah'!\"    The sunset gun boomed out from the citadel. David turned to go, and  Lacey added:    \"I'm waiting for a pasha who's taking toll of the officers inside  there--Achmet Pasha. They call him the Ropemaker, because so many pass  through his hands to the Nile. The Old Muslin I call him, because he's  so diaphanous. Thinks nobody can see through him, and there's nobody  that can't. If you stay long in Egypt, you'll find that Achmet is the  worst, and Nahoum the Armenian the deepest, pasha in all this sickening  land. Achmet is cruel as a tiger to any one that stands in his way;  Nahoum, the whale, only opens out to swallow now and then; but when  Nahoum does open out, down goes Jonah, and never comes up again. He's  a deep one, and a great artist is Nahoum. I'll bet a dollar you'll see  them both to-night at the Palace--if Kaid doesn't throw them to the  lions for their dinner before yours is served. Here one shark is  swallowed by another bigger, till at last the only and original  sea-serpent swallows 'em all.\"    As David wound his way down the hills, Lacey waved a hand after him.    \"Well, give my love to the girls,\" he said.          CHAPTER VI. \"HAST THOU NEVER KILLED A MAN?\"    \"Claridge Effendi!\"    As David moved forward, his mind was embarrassed by many impressions.  He was not confused, but the glitter and splendour, the Oriental  gorgeousness of the picture into which he stepped, excited his  eye, roused some new sense in him. He was a curious figure in those  surroundings. The consuls and agents of all the nations save one were  in brilliant uniform, and pashas, generals, and great officials were  splendid in gold braid and lace, and wore flashing Orders on their  breasts. David had been asked for half-past eight o'clock, and he was  there on the instant; yet here was every one assembled, the Prince Pasha  included. As he walked up the room he suddenly realised this fact, and,  for a moment, he thought he had made a mistake; but again he remembered  distinctly that the letter said half-past eight, and he wondered now  if this had been arranged by the Prince--for what purpose? To afford  amusement to the assembled company? He drew himself up with dignity, his  face became graver. He had come in a Quaker suit of black broadcloth,  with grey steel buttons, and a plain white stock; and he wore his  broad-brimmed hat--to the consternation of the British Consul-General  and the Europeans present, to the amazement of the Turkish and native  officials, who eyed him keenly. They themselves wore red tarbooshes, as  did the Prince; yet all of them knew that the European custom of showing  respect was by doffing the hat. The Prince Pasha had settled that with  David, however, at their first meeting, when David had kept on his hat  and offered Kaid his hand.    Now, with amusement in his eyes, Prince Kaid watched David coming up the  great hall. What his object was in summoning David for an hour when  all the court and all the official Europeans should be already present,  remained to be seen. As David entered, Kaid was busy receiving salaams,  and returning greeting, but with an eye to the singularly boyish yet  gallant figure approaching. By the time David had reached the group, the  Prince Pasha was ready to receive him.    \"Friend, I am glad to welcome thee,\" said the Effendina, sly humour  lurking at the corner of his eye. Conscious of the amazement of all  present, he held out his hand to David.    \"May thy coming be as the morning dew, friend,\" he added, taking David's  willing hand.    \"And thy feet, Kaid, wall in goodly paths, by the grace of God the  compassionate and merciful.\"    As a wind, unfelt, stirs the leaves of a forest, making it rustle  delicately, a whisper swept through the room. Official Egypt was  dumfounded. Many had heard of David, a few had seen him, and now all  eyed with inquisitive interest one who defied so many of the customs of  his countrymen; who kept on his hat; who used a Mahommedan salutation  like a true believer; whom the Effendina honoured--and presently  honoured in an unusual degree by seating him at table opposite himself,  where his Chief Chamberlain was used to sit.    During dinner Kaid addressed his conversation again and again to David,  asking questions put to disconcert the consuls and other official folk  present, confident in the naive reply which would be returned. For there  was a keen truthfulness in the young man's words which, however suave  and carefully balanced, however gravely simple and tactful, left no  doubt as to their meaning. There was nothing in them which could be  challenged, could be construed into active criticism of men or things;  and yet much he said was horrifying. It made Achmet Pasha sit up  aghast, and Nahoum Pasha, the astute Armenian, for a long time past the  confidant and favourite of the Prince Pasha, laugh in his throat; for,  if there was a man in Egypt who enjoyed the thrust of a word or the  bite of a phrase, it was Nahoum. Christian though he was, he was,  nevertheless, Oriental to his farthermost corner, and had the culture of  a French savant. He had also the primitive view of life, and the morals  of a race who, in the clash of East and West, set against Western  character and directness, and loyalty to the terms of a bargain, the  demoralised cunning of the desert folk; the circuitous tactics of those  who believed that no man spoke the truth directly, that it must ever  be found beneath devious and misleading words, to be tracked like a  panther, as an Antipodean bushman once said, \"through the sinuosities  of the underbrush.\" Nahoum Pasha had also a rich sense of grim humour.  Perhaps that was why he had lived so near the person of the Prince, had  held office so long. There were no Grand Viziers in Egypt; but he was  as much like one as possible, and he had one uncommon virtue, he was  greatly generous. If he took with his right hand he gave with his left;  and Mahommedan as well as Copt and Armenian, and beggars of every race  and creed, hung about his doors each morning to receive the food and  alms he gave freely.    After one of David's answers to Kaid, which had had the effect  of causing his Highness to turn a sharp corner of conversation by  addressing himself to the French consul, Nahoum said suavely:    \"And so, monsieur, you think that we hold life lightly in the East--that  it is a characteristic of civilisation to make life more sacred, to  cherish it more fondly?\"    He was sitting beside David, and though he asked the question casually,  and with apparent intention only of keeping talk going, there was a  lurking inquisition in his eye. He had seen enough to-night to make  him sure that Kaid had once more got the idea of making a European  his confidant and adviser; to introduce to his court one of those  mad Englishmen who cared nothing for gold--only for power; who loved  administration for the sake of administration and the foolish joy of  labour. He was now set to see what sort of match this intellect could  play, when faced by the inherent contradictions present in all truths or  the solutions of all problems.    \"It is one of the characteristics of that which lies behind  civilisation, as thee and me have been taught,\" answered David.    Nahoum was quick in strategy, but he was unprepared for David's  knowledge that he was an Armenian Christian, and he had looked for  another answer.    But he kept his head and rose to the occasion. \"Ah, it is high, it is  noble, to save life--it is so easy to destroy it,\" he answered. \"I saw  his Highness put his life in danger once to save a dog from drowning. To  cherish the lives of others, and to be careless of our own; to give  that of great value as though it were of no worth--is it not the  Great Lesson?\" He said it with such an air of sincerity, with such  dissimulation, that, for the moment, David was deceived. There was,  however, on the face of the listening Kaid a curious, cynical smile. He  had heard all, and he knew the sardonic meaning behind Nahoum's words.    Fat High Pasha, the Chief Chamberlain, the corrupt and corruptible,  intervened. \"It is not so hard to be careless when care would be  useless,\" he said, with a chuckle. \"When the khamsin blows the  dust-storms upon the caravan, the camel-driver hath no care for his  camels. 'Malaish!' he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6312"],[0,"Representative Men: Seven Lectures (#11)"],[1,"ames,  significant of a profound sense. The gods are the ideas. Pan is speech,  or manifestation; Saturn, the contemplative; Jove, the regal soul; and  Mars, passion. Venus is proportion; Calliope, the soul of the world;  Aglaia, intellectual illustration.    These thoughts, in sparkles of light, had appeared often to pious and  to poetic souls; but this well-bred, all-knowing Greek geometer comes  with command, gathers them all up into rank and gradation, the Euclid  of holiness, and marries the two parts of nature. Before all men, he  saw the intellectual values of the moral sentiment. He describes his  own ideal, when he paints in Timaeus a god leading things from disorder  into order. He kindled a fire so truly in the center, that we see the  sphere illuminated, and can distinguish poles, equator, and lines of  latitude, every arc and node; a theory so averaged, so modulated, that  you would say, the winds of ages had swept through this rhythmic  structure, and not that it was the brief extempore blotting of one  short-lived scribe. Hence it has happened that a very well-marked  class of souls, namely those who delight in giving a spiritual, that  is, an ethico-intellectual expression to every truth by exhibiting an  ulterior end which is yet legitimate to it, are said to Platonize.  Thus, Michel Angelo is a Platonist, in his sonnets. Shakspeare is a  Platonist, when he writes, \"Nature is made better by no mean, but  nature makes that mean,\" or,       \"He that can endure     To follow with allegiance a fallen lord,     Does conquer him that did his master conquer,     And earns a place in the story.\"    Hamlet is a pure Platonist, and 'tis the magnitude only of Shakspeare's  proper genius that hinders him from being classed as the most eminent  of this school. Swedenborg, throughout his prose poem of \"Conjugal  Love,\" is a Platonist.    His subtlety commended him to men of thought. The secret of his popular  success is the moral aim, which endeared him to mankind. \"Intellect,\"  he said, \"is king of heaven and of earth;\" but, in Plato, intellect  is always moral. His writings have also the sempiternal youth of poetry.  For their arguments, most of them, might have been couched in sonnets;  and poetry has never soared higher than in the Timaeus and the Phaedrus.  As the poet, too, he is only contemplative. He did not, like Pythagoras,  break himself with an institution. All his painting in the Republic  must be esteemed mythical, with intent to bring out, sometimes in  violent colors, his thought. You cannot institute, without peril of  charlatan.    It was a high scheme, his absolute privilege for the best (which, to  make emphatic, he expressed by community of women), as the premium  which he would set on grandeur. There shall be exempts of two kinds:  first, those who by demerit have put themselves below  protection,--outlaws; and secondly, those who by eminence of nature  and desert are out of the reach of your rewards; let such be free of  the city, and above the law. We confide them to themselves; let them  do with us as they will. Let none presume to measure the irregularities  of Michel Angelo and Socrates by village scales.    In his eighth book of the Republic, he throws a little mathematical  dust in our eyes. I am sorry to see him, after such noble superiorities,  permitting the lie to governors. Plato plays Providence a little with  the baser sort, as people allow themselves with their dogs and cats.          III. SWEDENBORG; OR, THE MYSTIC.    Among eminent persons, those who are most dear to men are not the class  which the economists call producers; they have nothing in their hands;  they have not cultivated corn, nor made bread; they have not led out  a colony, nor invented a loom. A higher class, in the estimation and  love of this city-building, market-going race of mankind, are the  poets, who, from the intellectual kingdom, feed the thought and  imagination with ideas and pictures which raise men out of the world  of corn and money, and console them for the shortcomings of the day,  and the meannesses of labor and traffic. Then, also, the philosopher  has his value, who flatters the intellect of this laborer, by engaging  him with subtleties which instruct him in new faculties. Others may  build cities; he is to understand them, and keep them in awe. But there  is a class who lead us into another region,--the world of morals, or  of will. What is singular about this region of thought, is, its claim.  Wherever the sentiment of right comes in, it takes precedence of  everything else. For other things, I make poetry of them; but the moral  sentiment makes poetry of me.    I have sometimes thought that he would render the greatest service to  modern criticism, who shall draw the line of relation that subsists  between Shakespeare and Swedenborg. The human mind stands ever in  perplexity, demanding intellect, demanding sanctity, impatient equally  of each without the other. The reconciler has not yet appeared. If we  tire of the saints, Shakespeare is our city of refuge. Yet the instincts  presently teach, that the problem of essence must take precedence of  all others,--the questions of Whence? What? and Whither? and the  solution of these must be in a life, and not in a book. A drama or  poem is a proximate or oblique reply; but Moses, Menu, Jesus, work  directly on this problem. The atmosphere of moral sentiment is a region  of grandeur which reduces all material magnificence to toys, yet opens  to every wretch that has reason, the doors of the universe. Almost  with a fierce haste it lays its empire on the man. In the language of  the Koran, \"God said, the heaven and the earth, and all that is between  them, think ye that we created them in jest, and that ye shall not  return to us?\" It is the kingdom of the will, and by inspiring the  will, which is the seat of personality, seems to convert the universe  into a person:--      \"The realms of being to no other bow,    Not only all are thine, but all are Thou.\"    All men are commanded by the saint. The Koran makes a distinct class  of those who are by nature good, and whose goodness has an influence  on others, and pronounces this class to be the aim of creation: the  other classes are admitted to the feast of being, only as following  in the train of this. And the Persian poet exclaims to a soul of this  kind:      \"Go boldly forth, and feast on being's banquet;    Thou art the called,--the rest admitted with thee.\"    The privilege of this caste is an access to the secrets and structure  of nature, by some higher method than by experience. In common parlance,  what one man is said to learn by experience, a man of extraordinary  sagacity is said, without experience, to divine. The Arabians say,  that Abul Khain, the mystic, and Abu Ali Seena, the Philosopher,  conferred together; and, on parting, the philosopher said, \"All that  he sees, I know;\" and the mystic said, \"All that he knows, I see.\" If  one should ask the reason of this intuition, the solution would lead  us into that property which Plato denoted as Reminiscence, and which  is implied by the Bramins in the tenet of Transmigration. The soul  having been often born, or, as the Hindoos say, \"traveling the path  of existence through thousands of births,\" having beheld the things  which are here, those which are in heaven, and those which are beneath,  there is nothing of which she has not gained the knowledge: no wonder  that she is able to recollect, in regard to any one thing, what formerly  she knew. \"For, all things in nature being linked and related, and  the soul having heretofore known all, nothing hinders but that any man  who has recalled to mind, or, according to the common phrase, has  learned one thing only, should of himself recover all his ancient  knowledge, and find out again all the rest, if he have but courage,  and faint not in the midst of his researches. For inquiry and learning  is reminiscence all.\" How much more, if he that inquires be a holy and  godlike soul! For, by being assimilated to the original soul, by whom,  and after whom, all things subsist, the soul of man does then easily  flow into all things, and all things flow into it: they mix: and he  is present and sympathetic with their structure and law.    This path is difficult, secret, and beset with terror. The ancients  called it ecstasy or absence,--a getting out of their bodies to think.  All religious history contains traces of the trance of saints,--a  beatitude, but without any sign of joy, earnest, solitary, even sad;  \"the flight,\" Plotinus called it, \"of the alone to the alone.\" The  trances of Socrates, Plotinus, Porphyry, Behmen, Bunyan, Fox, Pascal,  Guion, Swedenborg, will readily come to mind. But what as readily comes  to mind, is the accompaniment of disease. This beatitude comes in  terror, and with shocks to the mind of the receiver. \"It o'erinforms  the tenement of clay,\" and drives the man mad; or, gives a certain  violent bias, which taints his judgment. In the chief examples of  religious illumination, somewhat morbid, has mingled, in spite of the  unquestionable increase of mental power. Must the highest good drag  after it a quality which neutralizes and discredits it?--                                    \"Indeed it takes    From our achievements, when performed at height,    The pith and marrow of our attribute.\"    Shall we say, that the economical mother disburses so much earth and  so much fire, by weight and metre, to make a man, and will not add a  pennyweight, though a nation is perishing for a leader? Therefore, the  men of God purchased their science by folly or pain. If you will have  pure carbon, carbuncle, or diamond, to make the brain transparent, the  trunk and organs shall be so much the grosser: instead of porcelain,  they are potter's earth, clay, or mud.    In modern times, no such remarkable example of this introverted mind  has occurred, as in Emanuel"]]]
