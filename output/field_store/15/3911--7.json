For a moment he sat motionless, and as he sat the moon fell full upon  his face, and Stella saw the face of the portrait whose eyes she had  but a few minutes since hidden from her sight.    A lifetime of emotion may pass in a minute; a life's fate hangs upon  the balance of a stroke of time. It was only for a moment that they  looked into each other's eyes in silence, but that moment meant so much  to each of them! It was the horse that broke the spell by attempting  to rise again. With a slight movement of the hand Leycester Wyndward  forced him down, and then slid from the saddle and stood at Stella's  feet, hat in hand.    Even then he paused as if afraid, lest a word should cause the vision  to vanish into thin air; but at last he opened his lips.    \"I beg your pardon.\"    That was all. Four words only, and words that one hears daily; words  that have almost lost their import from too familiar commonplace,  and yet, as he said them, they sounded so entirely, so earnestly, so  intensely significant and full of meaning that all the commonplace  drifted from them, and they conveyed to the listener's ear a real and  eager prayer for forgiveness; so real and earnest that to have passed  them by with the conventional smile and bow would have been an insult,  and impossible.    But it was not only the words and the tone, but the voice that thrilled  through Stella's soul, and seemed to wake an echoing chord. The picture  which had so awed her had been dumb and voiceless; but now it seemed  as if it had spoken even as it had smiled, and for a moment she felt a  woman's desire to shut out the sound, as she had shut out the smiling  eyes.    It was the maidenly impulse of self-protection, against what evil she  did not know or dream.    \"I beg your pardon,\" he said again, his voice deep and musical, his  eyes raised to hers. \"I am afraid I frightened you. I thought I was  alone here. Will you forgive me?\"    Stella looked down at him, and a faint color stole into her cheeks.    \"It is I who should beg pardon; I am not frightened, but your horse  was--and by me?\"    He half glanced at the horse standing quiet enough now, with its bridle  over his arm.    \"He is an idiot!\" he said, quickly; \"an obstinate idiot, and incapable  of fear. It was mere pretense.\"    \"For which you punished him,\" said Stella, with a quick smile.    He looked up at her, and slowly there came into his eyes and his lips  that smile of which Mr. Etheridge had spoken, and which Stella had  foreseen.    \"You are afraid I am going to whip him again?\"    \"Yes,\" she said, with simple directness.    He looked at her with a curious smile.    \"You are right,\" he said; \"I was. There are times when he requires a  little correction; to-night is one of them. We have not seen each other  for some little time, and he has forgotten who is master. But I shall  not forget your 'No,' and will spare the whip; are you satisfied?\"    It was a strange speech, closing with a strangely abrupt question. It  was characteristic of the speaker, who never in all his life probably  had known for a moment what nervousness or embarrassment meant. Judging  by his tone, the easy flow of the musical voice, the frank, open  manner, one would have imagined that this meeting with a strange and  beautiful girl was the most matter-of-fact affair.    \"Are you satisfied?\" he repeated, as Stella remained silent, trying  to fight against the charm of his simple and direct manner. \"If not,  perhaps that will do it?\" and taking the whip, a strong hunter's crop,  in both his white hands, he broke it in two as easily as if it were a  reed, and flung it over his shoulder.    Stella flushed, but she laughed, and her dark eyes beamed down upon him  with serious archness.    \"Does not that look as if you were afraid you should not keep your  promise?\"    He smiled up at her.    \"It does,\" he said--\"you are right; I may have been tempted beyond my  strength. He is a bad-tempered beast, and I am another. Why do you  laugh----?\"    He broke off, his voice changing as subtly as some musical instrument.    Stella hesitated a moment.    \"I beg you will tell me--I shall not be offended.\"    She laughed, and clung with one hand to the lilac, looking down on him.    \"I was thinking how fortunate it was that he could not whip you. It is  not fair, as you are both so bad-tempered, that one only should get  punished.\"    He did not laugh, as another man would have done; but there came into  the dark eyes a flash of surprised amusement, such as might have shone  in those of the giant Gulliver when some Liliputian struck him with a  pin-sized stick; and his lips parted with a smile.    \"It was a natural reflection,\" he said, after a pause. \"Will you let me  help you down?\"    Stella shook her head. Somehow she felt safe up there above him, where  but the dark eyes could reach her.    \"Thank you, no; I am gathering some lilac. Do not trouble.\"    And she turned slightly from him, and stretched up her hand for a  branch above her head. The next moment he sprang up the bank lightly,  and stood beside her.    \"Permit me,\" he said. And with one sweep he drew the fragrant branch  within her reach.    \"And now will you come down?\" he asked, as if she were some willful  child. Stella smiled, and he held out his hand. She put hers into it,  and his fingers closed over it with a grasp firm as steel, but as  smooth as a woman's. As the warm fingers closed over hers, which were  cold with her long grasp of the branch above her head, a thrill ran  through her and caused her to shudder slightly.    \"You are cold,\" he said, instantly. \"The Spring evenings are  treacherous. Have you far to go?\"    \"I am not cold, thanks,\" she said, with quick alarm, for there was  a look in his eyes and a movement of his hand which seemed to give  warning that he was about to take his coat off.    \"I am not at all cold!\"    \"Have you far to go?\" he repeated, with the air, gentle as it was, of a  man who was accustomed to have his questions answered.    \"Not far; to the little white gate there,\" she answered.    \"The little white gate--to Etheridge's, the artist's?\" he said gently,  with a tone of surprise.    Stella bent her head; his eyes scanned her face.    \"You live there--are staying there?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I never saw you in Wyndward before.\"    \"No, I was never here till to-night.\"    \"Till to-night?\" he echoed. \"I knew that I had not seen you before.\"    There was something in the tone, wholly unlike commonplace flattery,  that brought the color to Stella's face.    They had reached the gate by this time, he walking by her side, the  bridle thrown over his arm, the great horse pacing quiet and lamb-like,  and Stella stopped.    \"Good-night,\" she said.    He stopped short and looked at her, his head thrown back, as she had  seen it as he rode toward her, his eyes fixed intently on her face, and  seeming to sink through her downcast eyes into her soul.    \"Good-night,\" he replied. \"Wait.\"    It was a word of command, for all its musical gentleness, and Stella,  woman-like, stopped.    \"I am going away,\" he said, not abruptly, but with calm directness. \"If  you have only come to-night I shall not be able to learn your name;  before I go, will you tell it me?\"    Stella smiled.    \"Why not?\" he said, as she hesitated.    \"My name is Stella Etheridge, I am Mr. Etheridge's niece.\"    \"Stella!\" he repeated. \"Stella! Thank you. I shall not forget. My  name,\" and he raised his hat with a simple gesture of proud humility,  \"is Wyndward--Leycester Wyndward.\"    \"I know it,\" said Stella, and the next moment she could have called the  impulsive words back again.    \"You know it!\" he said; \"and came here only to-night! How is that?\"    Stella's brows contracted, dark and full they met across her brow in  true southern fashion, and lent a significant eloquence to her face;  she would have given much to avoid answering.    \"How is that?\" he asked, his eyes fixed on hers.    \"It is very simple,\" she said, as if vexed at her hesitation. \"I saw  your portrait and--knew you.\"    He smiled a curious smile.    \"Knew me before we met! I wonder----\" he paused and his eyes seemed to  read her thoughts. \"I wonder whether you were prejudiced by what you  saw by that forshadowing of me? Is that a fair question?\"    \"It is a strange one,\" said Stella.    \"Is it? I will not press it. Good-night!\" and he raised his hat.    \"Good-night, and good-bye,\" she said, and impulsively again she held  out her hand.    His eyes showed no surprise, whatever he may have felt, as he took her  hand and held it.    \"No,\" he said, as he let her draw it away. \"Not good-bye. I have  changed my mind. I shall not go. It is only good-night,\" and with a  smile flashing out of his eyes, he leapt upon his horse and was gone.          CHAPTER III.      Stella stood watching until the big chestnut had borne its master out  of sight, and down the lane, across the meadow; she caught one more  glimpse of them as he rode through the ford, the water dashing up a  silver shower of spray as high as the horse's head; then they vanished  in the shadow of the woods which engirdled Wyndward Hall.    But she still stood, lost in a dreamy reverie that was not thought,  until her uncle's voice came floating down the garden, and with a start  she ran up the path and stood breathless before him.    The old man's placid face wore a slight look of anxiety, which faded  instantly as he said:    \"Where have you been, Stella? I thought you had changed your mind,  and flown back to Italy again. Mrs. Penfold is searching the meadows  wildly.\"    Stella laughed, as she put her arm round his neck.    \"You will not get rid of me so easily, uncle. No, I have only been down  the pretty lane at the end of the garden. See, here are some flowers;  are they not sweet? You shall have them for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5342"],[0,"The Story Girl (#11)"],[1,"with  himself. It was ten miles from Berwick to the bay shore, and a call at  a half way house was just the thing. Then Donald brought out the whisky.  They always did that eighty years ago, you know. If you were a woman,  you could give your visitors a dish of tea; but if you were a man and  did not offer them a 'taste' of whisky, you were thought either very  mean or very ignorant.    \"'You look cold,' said Donald, in his great, hearty voice. 'Sit nearer  the fire, man, and put a bit of warmth in your veins. It's bitter cold  the day. And now tell me the Berwick news. Has Jean McLean made up  with her man yet? And is it true that Sandy McQuarrie is to marry Kate  Ferguson? 'Twill be a match now! Sure, with her red hair, Sandy will not  be like to lose his bride past finding.'    \"Neil had plenty of news to tell. And the more whisky he drank the more  he told. He didn't notice that Donald was not taking much. Neil talked  on and on, and of course he soon began to tell things it would have been  much wiser not to tell. Finally he told Donald that he was going over  the bay to ask Nancy Sherman that very night to marry him. And if she  would have him, then Donald and all the folks should see a wedding that  WAS a wedding.    \"Oh, wasn't Donald taken aback! This was more than he had expected. Neil  hadn't been courting Nancy very long, and Donald never dreamed he would  propose to her QUITE so soon.    \"At first Donald didn't know what to do. He felt sure deep down in his  heart, that Nancy liked HIM. She was very shy and modest, but you know  a girl can let a man see she likes him without going out of her way. But  Donald knew that if Neil proposed first he would have the best chance.  Neil was rich and the Shermans were poor, and old Elias Sherman would  have the most to say in the matter. If he told Nancy she must take Neil  Campbell she would never dream of disobeying him. Old Elias Sherman was  a man who had to be obeyed. But if Nancy had only promised some one else  first her father would not make her break her word.    \"Wasn't it a hard plight for poor Donald? But he was a Scotchman,  you know, and it's pretty hard to stick a Scotchman long. Presently a  twinkle came into his eyes, for he remembered that all was fair in love  and war. So he said to Neil, oh, so persuasively,    \"'Have some more, man, have some more. 'Twill keep the heart in you in  the teeth of that wind. Help yourself. There's plenty more where that  came from.'    \"Neil didn't want MUCH persuasion. He took some more, and said slyly,    \"'Is it going over the bay the night that yourself will be doing?'    \"Donald shook his head.    \"'I had thought of it,' he owned, 'but it looks a wee like a storm, and  my sleigh is at the blacksmith's to be shod. If I went it must be on  Black Dan's back, and he likes a canter over the ice in a snow-storm  as little as I. His own fireside is the best place for a man to-night,  Campbell. Have another taste, man, have another taste.'    \"Neil went on 'tasting,' and that sly Donald sat there with a sober  face, but laughing eyes, and coaxed him on. At last Neil's head fell  forward on his breast, and he was sound asleep. Donald got up, put on  his overcoat and cap, and went to the door.    \"'May your sleep be long and sweet, man,' he said, laughing softly, 'and  as for the waking, 'twill be betwixt you and me.'    \"With that he untied Neil's horse, climbed into Neil's sleigh, and  tucked Neil's buffalo robe about him.    \"'Now, Bess, old girl, do your bonniest,' he said. 'There's more than  you know hangs on your speed. If the Campbell wakes too soon Black Dan  could show you a pair of clean heels for all your good start. On, my  girl.'    \"Brown Bess went over the ice like a deer, and Donald kept thinking of  what he should say to Nancy--and more still of what she would say to  him. SUPPOSE he was mistaken. SUPPOSE she said 'no!'    \"'Neil would have the laugh on me then. Sure he's sleeping well. And the  snow is coming soon. There'll be a bonny swirl on the bay ere long. I  hope no harm will come to the lad if he starts to cross. When he wakes  he'll be in such a fine Highland temper that he'll never stop to think  of danger. Well, Bess, old girl, here we are. Now, Donald Fraser, pluck  up heart and play the man. Never flinch because a slip of a lass looks  scornful at you out of the bonniest dark-blue eyes on earth.'    \"But in spite of his bold words Donald's heart was thumping as he drove  into the Sherman yard. Nancy was there milking a cow by the stable door,  but she stood up when she saw Donald coming. Oh, she was very beautiful!  Her hair was like a skein of golden silk, and her eyes were as blue as  the gulf water when the sun breaks out after a storm. Donald felt more  nervous than ever. But he knew he must make the most of his chance. He  might not see Nancy alone again before Neil came. He caught her hand and  stammered out,    \"'Nan, lass, I love you. You may think 'tis a hasty wooing, but that's a  story I can tell you later maybe. I know well I'm not worthy of you, but  if true love could make a man worthy there'd be none before me. Will you  have me, Nan?'    \"Nancy didn't SAY she would have him. She just LOOKED it, and Donald  kissed her right there in the snow.    \"The next morning the storm was over. Donald knew Neil must be soon  on his track. He did not want to make the Sherman house the scene of  a quarrel, so he resolved to get away before the Campbell came.  He persuaded Nancy to go with him to visit some friends in another  settlement. As he brought Neil's sleigh up to the door he saw a black  speck far out on the bay and laughed.    \"'Black Dan goes well, but he'll not be quick enough,' he said.    \"Half an hour later Neil Campbell rushed into the Sherman kitchen and  oh, how angry he was! There was nobody there but Betty Sherman, and  Betty was not afraid of him. She was never afraid of anybody. She was  very handsome, with hair as brown as October nuts and black eyes and  crimson cheeks; and she had always been in love with Neil Campbell  herself.    \"'Good morning, Mr. Campbell,' she said, with a toss of her head. 'It's  early abroad you are. And on Black Dan, no less! Was I mistaken in  thinking that Donald Fraser said once that his favourite horse should  never be backed by any man but him? But doubtless a fair exchange is no  robbery, and Brown Bess is a good mare in her way.'    \"'Where is Donald Fraser?' said Neil, shaking his fist. 'It's him I'm  seeking, and it's him I will be finding. Where is he, Betty Sherman?'    \"'Donald Fraser is far enough away by this time,' mocked Betty. 'He is a  prudent fellow, and has some quickness of wit under that sandy thatch of  his. He came here last night at sunset, with a horse and sleigh not his  own, or lately gotten, and he asked Nan in the stable yard to marry him.  Did a man ask ME to marry him at the cow's side with a milking pail  in my hand, it's a cold answer he'd get for his pains. But Nan thought  differently, and they sat late together last night, and 'twas a bonny  story Nan wakened me to hear when she came to bed--the story of a braw  lover who let his secret out when the whisky was above the wit, and then  fell asleep while his rival was away to woo and win his lass. Did you  ever hear a like story, Mr. Campbell?'    \"'Oh, yes,' said Neil fiercely. 'It is laughing at me over the country  side and telling that story that Donald Fraser will be doing, is it? But  when I meet him it is not laughing he will be doing. Oh, no. There will  be another story to tell!'    \"'Now, don't meddle with the man,' cried Betty. 'What a state to be in  because one good-looking lass likes sandy hair and gray eyes better  than Highland black and blue! You have not the spirit of a wren, Neil  Campbell. Were I you, I would show Donald Fraser that I could woo and  win a lass as speedily as any Lowlander of them all; that I would!  There's many a girl would gladly say 'yes' for your asking. And here  stands one! Why not marry ME, Neil Campbell? Folks say I'm as bonny as  Nan--and I could love you as well as Nan loves her Donald--ay, and ten  times better!'    \"What do you suppose the Campbell did? Why, just the thing he ought to  have done. He took Betty at her word on the spot; and there was a double  wedding soon after. And it is said that Neil and Betty were the happiest  couple in the world--happier even than Donald and Nancy. So all was well  because it ended well!\"    The Story Girl curtsied until her silken skirts swept the floor. Then  she flung herself in her chair and looked at Mr. Campbell, flushed,  triumphant, daring.    The story was old to us. It had once been published in a Charlottetown  paper, and we had read in Aunt Olivia's scrapbook, where the Story Girl  had learned it. But we had listened entranced. I have written down the  bare words of the story, as she told it; but I can never reproduce the  charm and colour and spirit she infused into it. It LIVED for us. Donald  and Neil, Nancy and Betty, were there in that room with us. We saw the  flashes of expression on their faces, we heard their voices, angry or  tender, mocking or merry, in Lowland and Highland accent. We realized  all the mingled coquetry and feeling and defiance and archness in Betty  Sherman's daring speech. We had even forgotten all about Mr. Campbell.    That gentleman, in silence, took out his wallet, extracted a note  therefrom, and handed it gravely to the Story Girl.    \"There are five dollars for you,\" he said, \"and your story was well  worth it. You ARE a wonder. Some day you will make the world realize  it. I've been about a bit, and heard some good things, but I've never  enjoyed anything more than that threadbare old story I heard in my  cradle. And now, will you do me a favour?\"    \"Of course,\" said the delighted Story Girl.    \"Recite the multiplication table for me,\" said Mr. Campbell.    We stared. Well might Mr. Campbell be called"]]]
