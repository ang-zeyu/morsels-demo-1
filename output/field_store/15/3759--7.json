[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37872"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 1, December, 1850 (#11)"],[1," a  lingering illness. We translate the following for the _International_:--    \"It is indeed a painful or rather a terrible condition in which Heine  now is and has been for the past year; though the paralysis has made no  progress, it has at least experienced no alleviation. He has now lain  near two years in bed, and during that time has not seen a tree nor a  speck of the blue sky. He cannot raise himself, and scarcely moves. His  left eye is blind, his right can just perceive objects, but cannot bear  the light of day. His nights are disturbed by fearful torments, and only  morphine can produce him the least repose. Hope of recovery has long  been given up, and he himself entertains no illusions on that subject.  He knows that his sufferings can end only with death. He speaks of this  with the utmost composure.\"    The writer goes on to contradict, as calumnious, the report that Heine  had become religious, saying, that he bears his tortures without \"the  assistance of saints of any color, and by the inward power of the free  man.\" He does not regard himself as a sinner, and has nothing to repent  of, since he has but rejoiced like a child, in everything  beautiful--chasing butterflies, finding flowers by the way-side, and  making a holiday of his whole life. He has, however, often called  himself religious, by way of contradiction, and from antipathy to a  certain clique who openly proclaim themselves atheists, and under that  sonorous title seek to exercise a certain terror on others.    It seems that Heine has lost a great deal of property through various  speculators who have persuaded him to join in their schemes. The writer  says: \"Heine's friends are enraged at many of these individuals, and  urge him to attack them publicly, and show them up in their true light.  He owes this satisfaction to himself and to us; at the same time it  would conciliate many who have not pardoned him the cavalier air with  which he has turned off the most respectable notabilities of literature  and patriotism, in order to amuse himself in the company of some  adventurer.\" By this love for out-of-the-way characters, the writer  thinks that Heine must have collected the materials for a humorous  novel, which could equal the best productions of Mendoza, Smollett, or  Dickens; his experiences in this line have cost him a great deal of  money. We translate the conclusion of the article:--    \"We shall be asked if Heine really continues to write? Yes; he writes,  he works, he dictates poems without cessation; perhaps he was never in  his whole life as active as now. Several hours a day he devotes to the  composition of his memoirs which are rapidly advancing under the hand of  his secretary. His mind still resembles, in its wonderful fullness and  vigor, those fantastic ball-nights of Paris, which, under the open sky,  unfold an endless life and variety. There rings the music, there rushes  the dance, and the loveliest and grotesquest forms flit hither and  thither. There are silent arbors for tears of happiness and sorrow, and  places for dancing, with light, full of loud bold laughter. Rockets  after rockets mount skyward, scattering millions of stars, and endless  extravagance of art, fire, poesy, passion, flames up, showing the world  now in green, now in purple light, till at last the clear silver stars  come out, and fill us with infinite delight, and the still consciousness  of life's beauty. Yes, Heine lives and writes incessantly. His body is  broken, but not his mind, which, on the sick bed rises to Promethean  power and courage. His arm is impotent; not so his satire, which still  in its velvet covering bears the fearful knife that has flayed alive so  many a Maryas. Yes, his frame is worn away, but not the grace in every  movement of his youthful spirit. Along with his memoirs, a complete  volume of poems has been written in these two years. They will not  appear till after the death of the poet; but I can say of them that they  unite in full perfection all the admirable gifts which have rendered his  former poems so brilliant. So struggles this extraordinary man against a  terrible destiny, with all the weapons of the soul, never despairing in  this vehement suffering, never descending to tears--bidding defiance to  the worst. As I stood before that sick bed, it seemed as if I saw the  sufferer of the Caucasus bound in iron chains, tortured by the vulture,  but still confronting fate unappalled, and there alone on the sea-shore  caressed by sea-nymphs. Yes, this is the sick-bed and the death-bed of a  great and free man; and to have come near him is not only a great  happiness but a great instruction.\"    Heine has never been well known in this country. The only work  by him we have seen in English is his _Beitrage zur Deutschen  Literatur-Geschichte_, translated by Mr. G.W. Haven, and published in  Boston, in 1846. It is remarkably clever, and audacious, as the  productions of this German-Frenchman generally are. He is now  fifty-three years of age, having been born at Dusseldorff, in 1797. As  several wealthy bankers, and other persons of substance, in Paris, are  related to him, and he has a pension from the French Government, he is  not likely to suffer very much from the losses of property referred to  in the _Zeitung aus Boehmen_.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Otto Zirckel has just published at Berlin a volume called \"Sketches  from and concerning the United States,\" which has some curious  peculiarities to the eyes of an American. It is intended as a guide for  Germans who wish either to emigrate to this country or to send their  money here for investment. It begins with a description of the voyage to  America and of the East, West and South of the Union; next it describes  the position of the farmer, physician, clergyman, teacher, jurist,  merchant, and editor, and the chance of the emigrant in each of these  professions. It is written with spirit and humor, and a good deal of  practical judgment and wisdom are concisely and clearly expressed. The  curious part is the advice given to speculators who wish to invest their  money here at a high rate of interest. The author seems to think America  a perfect Eldorado for money lenders, and his book cannot fail to  produce a considerable increase in the amount of German capital employed  in this country. The various state and national loans are described  correctly, showing that Dr. Zirckel might venture safely into the mazes  of Wall Street. The history of repudiation he has studied with care, and  the necessity of final resumption of payments even in Mississippi he  estimates with justice. He suggests as the safest means of managing  matters, that a number of wealthy families should combine their funds  and send over a special agent in whom they can confide, to manage the  same in shaving notes, speculating in land, lending on bond and  mortgage, and making money generally. Thus they can get a high return  and live comfortably in Europe on the toil of Americans, all of which  will be much more grateful to the capitalists than useful to this  country. Better for us to have no foreign capital at all than to have  the interest thereon carried away and consumed in Europe.           *       *       *       *       *    Emile Silvestre has sent forth a new volume, _Un Philosophe sous les  Toits_.           *       *       *       *       *    The work on Aerostation, by Mr. Green, recently published in  Philadelphia, has been much noticed in Europe, where--particularly in  France--the subject has attracted large attention, in consequence of the  death of Gale, (formerly a player at our Bowery Theater,) near Bordeaux,  and the recent wicked and ridiculous ascents with horses, ostriches, &c.  from the Hippodrome in Paris, and some experiments in ballooning at  Madrid. In an interesting paper in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, for the  fifteenth of October, we have an account of numerous theories,  experiments, and accidents, constituting an entertaining _resume_ of the  whole matter. Few instances of intrepidity, danger, and escape, excite  livelier emotion than the crossing from England to France by Blanchard,  and Dr. Jeffries, an American, on the seventh of January, 1785. When, by  the loss of gas, the balloon descended rapidly over the channel, and  approached near the surface of the sea, after everything had been thrown  out, even to their clothes, Jeffries offered to leap into the sea, and  by thus lightening the balloon further, afford Blanchard a chance of  safety. \"We must both be lost as the case is,\" said he; \"if you think  your preservation is possible, I am ready to sacrifice my life.\" The  French military ascents are particularly described. Companies of  aeronauts were formed and trained, and Bonaparte took one of them with  him to Egypt, but the British captured all the apparatus for the  generation of gas. The First Consul caused ascents in picturesque  balloons to be made on occasions of public rejoicing for victories, in  order to strike the imaginations of the Egyptians, and an aerostatic  academy was established near Paris. The writer mentions that Lieutenant  Gale, like poor Sam Patch, so famous for a similar absurdity, and for a  similar and not less miserable end, had drank too much brandy for  self-possession in a dangerous predicament. He thinks that the problem  of the direction or government of balloons cannot possibly be solved  with the mechanical means which science now commands; and that, as they  may be usefully employed for the study of the great physical laws of the  globe, all experiments should be restricted to the object of advancing  science. He dwells on what might be accomplished toward ascertaining the  true laws of the decrease of temperature in the elevated regions of the  air, of the decrease of density of the atmosphere, of the decrease of  humidity according to atmospheric heights, and of the celerity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#11)"],[1,"second subject (in F)  of the \"Insanae.\" The original words of this chorus--\"Svanisce in un  momento\"--are to the effect that the soul threatens to yield to the  fury of its enemies, yet trust in God keeps one steadfast. The music  admirably reflects these contrasting sentiments, first in the tumultuous  D minor section, and then in the tranquillity of the F major portion  which follows, no less than in the trustful quietude of the D major  conclusion. Latin words were adapted to three of the original choruses,  but nothing seems to be known as to the origin of the \"Insanae\"  adaptation. A full score of the motet, published by Breitkopf & Hartel  in 1809, was reviewed in the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung of August  15, 1810, as if it were an entirely original work. The source of the  Latin words also remains a mystery. They were presumably put together to  fit Haydn's music, but by whom we have no means of ascertaining.    It is interesting to know that Haydn brought the score of his \"Il  Ritorno di Tobia\" with him to England on the occasion of his first visit  in 1791, probably with a view to its performance here. Messrs Novello's  private library contains an oblong volume in the handwriting of Vincent  Novello, in which he has copied some numbers from \"Tobia,\" including the  air of Anna already mentioned, but not the \"Insanae\" chorus. The inside  cover of the book bears the following note in Novello's hand, written,  not later than 1820, under the contents of the volume:    \"The whole of the above are unpublished manuscripts, and were copied  from an extremely rare volume, containing the full orchestral score of  the entire oratorio, kindly lent to me for the purpose by my friend, Mr  Shield, who had obtained it from Haydn himself during the visit of the  latter to England in the year 1791.--VINCENT NOVELLO, 240 Oxford St.\"    [See an interesting account of \"Il Ritorno di Tobia\" in The Musical  Times for September 1901, p. 600.]    Some of our musical societies in search of novelties might do worse  than revive this almost completely forgotten oratorio. The airs  are exceedingly melodious, and the choruses bold and tuneful, with  well-developed fugue subjects. The \"Insanae\" already referred to is  frequently performed.    Opponents    In 1776 Haydn composed \"La Vera Costanza\" for the Court Theatre of  Vienna, but owing to certain intrigues it was declined by the management  and produced at Esterhaz instead. The opera was subsequently staged  at Vienna in 1790, and six of its airs and a duet were published by  Artaria. This incident makes it sufficiently plain that Haydn had  his opponents among the musicians and critics of Vienna as well as  elsewhere. Burney says a friend in Hamburg wrote him in 1772 that \"the  genius, fine ideas and fancy of Haydn, Ditters and Filitz were praised,  but their mixture of serious and comic was disliked, particularly as  there is more of the latter than the former in their works; and as for  rules, they knew but little of them.\" If we substitute \"humorous\" for  \"comic,\" this may be allowed to fully represent the views of the critics  and amateurs of Vienna in regard to Haydn's music.    And, unfortunately, the incident just mentioned was not a solitary one.  In 1778 Haydn applied for membership to the Tonkunstler Societat, for  whom he had in reality written his \"Il Ritorno di Tobia.\" One would have  expected such a body to receive him with open arms, but instead of that  they exacted a sum of 300 florins on the ground of his non-residence  in Vienna! Not only so, but they would fain have brought him under a  promise to compose for them whenever they chose to ask him. This latter  condition Haydn felt to be impossible in view of his engagement at  Esterhaz, and he withdrew his admission fee. That the society were not  ashamed of themselves is obvious from a further episode. Some years  after this they desired Haydn to rearrange his \"Tobia\" for a special  performance, and when he demanded payment for his trouble they promptly  decided to produce Hasse's \"Elena\" instead. Everything comes to the man  who waits. After his second visit to London the Tonkunstler Societat  welcomed Haydn at a special meeting, and with one voice appointed him  \"Assessor Senior\" for life. In return for this distinction he presented  the society with \"The Creation\" and \"The Seasons,\" to which gifts,  according to Pohl, its prosperity is mainly owing.    \"L'Isola Disabitata\"    If Haydn was thus less highly appreciated at home than he deserved to  be, there were others who knew his sterling worth. In 1779 he composed  one of his best operas, \"L'Isola Disabitata,\" the libretto of which was  by his old benefactor Metastasio, and this work procured his nomination  as a member of the Philharmonic Society of Modena. The following extract  of a letter written to Artaria in May 1781 is interesting in this  connection. He says: \"M. le Gros, director of the 'Concerts Spirituels'  [in Paris], wrote me a great many fine things about my Stabat Mater,  which had been given there four times with great applause; so this  gentleman asked permission to have it engraved. They made me an offer  to engrave all my future works on very advantageous terms, and are much  surprised that my compositions for the voice are so singularly pleasing.  I, however, am not in the least surprised, for, as yet, they have heard  nothing. If they could only hear my operetta, 'L'Isola Disabitata,' and  my last Shrove-tide opera, 'La Fedelta Premiata,' I do assure you that  no such work has hitherto been heard in Paris, nor, perhaps, in Vienna  either. My great misfortune is living in the country.\" It will be seen  from this what he thought of \"L'Isola,\" which was not heard in Vienna  until its performance at a concert given at the Court Theatre by  Willmann the 'cellist in 1785. Haydn sent the score to the King  of Spain, who showed his sense of the honour by the gift of a gold  snuff-box, set in brilliants. Other marks of royal attention were  bestowed upon him about this time. Thus, in 1784, Prince Henry of  Prussia sent him a gold medal and his portrait in return for the  dedication of six new quartets, while in 1787 King Frederick William  II gave him the famous gold ring which he afterwards always wore when  composing.    A Love Episode    But we have passed somewhat out of our chronological order. The absence  of love at home, as we all know, often encourages love abroad. Haydn  liked to have an occasional flirtation, as ardent as might be within the  bounds of decorum. Sometimes, indeed, according to our insular ideas of  such things, he exceeded the bounds of decorum, as in the case of which  we are now compelled to speak. Among the musicians who had been engaged  for the Esterhazy service in 1779 were a couple named Polzelli--the  husband a violinist, the wife a second-rate vocalist. Luigia Polzelli  was a lively Italian girl of nineteen. She does not seem to have been  happy with Polzelli, and Haydn's pity was roused for her, much  as Shelley's pity was roused for \"my unfortunate friend,\" Harriet  Westbrook. The pity, as often happens in such cases, ultimately ripened  into a violent passion.    We are not concerned to adopt an apologetic tone towards Haydn. But  Signora Polzelli was clearly an unscrupulous woman. She first got her  admirer into her power, and then used her position to dun him for money.  She had two sons, and the popular belief of the time that Haydn was  the father of the younger is perpetuated in several of the biographies.  Haydn had certainly a great regard for the boy, made him a pupil of  his own, and left him a small sum in his first will, which, however, he  revoked in the second. Signora Polzelli's conduct was probably natural  enough in the circumstances, but it must have been rather embarrassing  to Haydn. After the death of her husband, she wheedled him into signing  a paper promising to marry her in the event of his becoming a widower.  This promise he subsequently repudiated, but he cared for her well  enough to leave her an annuity in his will, notwithstanding that she  had married again. She survived him for twenty-three years, and her two  daughters were still living at Pesth in 1878.    Returning to 1779, an untoward event of that year was the destruction  by fire of the theatre at Esterhaz. The re-building of the house was  set about at once, the prince having meanwhile gone to Paris, and the  re-opening took place on October 15, 1780, when Haydn's \"La Fedelta  Premiata,\" already mentioned, was staged.    Correspondence    It was about this time that he began to correspond with Artaria, the  Vienna music-publisher, with whom he had business dealings for many  years. A large number of his letters is given in an English translation  by Lady Wallace. [See Letters of Distinguished Musicians. Translated  from the German by Lady Wallace. London, 1867]. They treat principally  of business matters, but are not unimportant as fixing the chronological  dates of some of his works. They exhibit in a striking way the simple,  honest, unassuming nature of the composer; and if they also show him  \"rather eager after gain, and even particular to a groschen,\" we must  not forget the ever-pressing necessity for economy under which he  laboured, and his almost lavish benevolence to straitened relatives and  friends. In one letter requesting an advance he writes: \"I am unwilling  to be in debt to tradesmen, and, thank God! I am free from this burden;  but as great people keep me so long waiting for payments, I have got  rather into difficulty. This letter, however, will be your security...I  will pay off the interest with my notes.\" There is no real ground  for charging Haydn with avarice, as some writers have done. \"Even  philosophers,\" as he remarked himself, \"occasionally stand in need of  money\"; and, as Beethoven said to George Thomson, when haggling  about prices, there is no reason why the \"true artist\""]]]
