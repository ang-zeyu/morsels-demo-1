A couple of mangy hounds  covered with sores were basking in the sun, heedless of the footfall of  our horses, lying as indifferent as their masters till we had dismounted  and seen our beasts attended to.    It is extraordinary to see how few necessaries these people seem to have,  and how little ambition they have to better themselves, so long as they  can indulge their vagabondizing propensities. There is assuredly no nation  on earth that so aptly illustrates Goldsmith's words,        \"Man wants but little here below,\"    as the black race of Australia.    Those we were now visiting had come from the districts of Shoal Haven,  Port Stephens, and Illawara. There were three men and as many women, one  of whom, a Mestiza, named Sarah, with two half-blood little children. One  of these, which, although above two years of age, was still at the breast,  had a skin quite white, red cheeks, and light-blue eyes, and could  scarcely be distinguished from the child of white parents. These presented  so characteristic a type of the race, that we could not resist an attempt  to make with them some of those admeasurements of the body already alluded  to, while the artist attached to the Expedition delineated their  appearance.    The skull of the Australian black is tolerably regular, the forehead broad  and high, the bridge of the nose pretty high, the eyes dark, brilliant,  and sunken; the nose and cheek-bones well marked. The mouth generally is  broad, the upper lip overhanging the under, and the upper teeth also  project beyond the under. The face, like the entire body, is hairy in an  unusual degree; the hair of the head is black, thin, often very fine in  texture, and slightly crisped without being woolly. The skin is usually  dark or dirty brown, or brownish black. The custom of marking the outer  arm from the shoulders downwards with three or four marks, from 1 to  1-1/2 inch long, and rather thick in the cicatrix, and continuing over the  back with similar incisions, is pretty universal, and seems to be  considered as a personal decoration. The elder people have the nasal  cartilage bored through, and wear in the orifice kangaroo bones, or other  bones, or even pieces of wood as amulets. We did not however remark this  among the younger generation; this hideous custom seems to have died out,  apparently on account of its discomfort.    The stay of the _Novara_ in Australia was, as already remarked, so brief,  that it did not admit of the scientific staff making more distant tours to  the great cattle \"stations,\" or gold districts. At the same time it  appears to us important to make some few observations on these two  products, to which Australia is indebted for her present prosperity, and  the former of which is fraught with even more of its future destiny than  the latter. At the commencement of the present century England used to  procure all her wool from Spain, and somewhat later from Germany[21] and  Hungary. Since that period the production of wool in the Cape, the East  Indies, and Australia, has so enormously increased, that Great Britain is  enabled to get from her colonies the entire consumption she requires for  her woollen manufactures, averaging from 60 to 70,000,000 lbs., thus  utilizing the agricultural energies of her emigrating children for the  behoof of the mother country and her industrial classes.    New South Wales produces at present (1858) above 17,000,000 lbs. of wool,  the whole of Australia about 50,000,000. The number of sheep has increased  from 29, imported by the first colonists in 1778,[22] to 8,139,160 in New  South Wales alone, the total for all Australia being about 15,000,000.  Some proprietors have upwards of 100,000 sheep, which they divide into  flocks of from 2000 to 3000, which are in charge each of its respective  shepherd, who keeps them in their own special \"runs.\"    The most suitable place for breeding sheep is Moreton Bay, lately raised  into a new independent colony by the name of Queen's Land. The sheep there  need but little attention, and the maladies to which they are subject in  the west and south never occur in that colony. Were it not for the  ravages of the wild dogs, the rearing of sheep would be attended with  hardly any expense. These are pastured on the crown lands, for the use of  which each squatter pays L10 per annum for every 4000 sheep, or 800 head  of cattle. In the north, \"Darling Downs\" are considered the best,  consisting of an open undulating table-land, broken here and there by  occasional clumps of trees, and much resembling the States of Minnesota  and Iowa, north and west of the Mississippi. On these Downs from 3000 to  4000 sheep can easily be kept by a single shepherd, whereas in Bathurst  800 would call into play all the watchfulness of a single individual. On  Darling Downs the annual increase of a flock of 100 ewes is 96 per cent.;  in Bathurst it is only 80. The value of a sheep is about 15_s._ to 20_s._,  and the shearing usually begins in October and lasts till December, the  average weight being 2-1/2 lbs. to the fleece. Innumerable teams of oxen  carry the wool in bales of 200 or 300 lbs. from hundreds of miles in the  interior down to the seaports, where the oxen and carts are usually sold,  as, owing to the low price of cattle, it would not be remunerative to take  them back without a freight. While we were in Australia an attempt had  been made, at much cost of time, trouble, and expense, to import from  their native Cordilleras a large number of Llamas or Alpacas, with the  view of increasing the value of Australian wool by a cross with the  Peruvian. An enterprising English merchant of Valparaiso, named Joshua  Waddington, who had been 40 years resident in Chili, was a chief promoter  of the undertaking. In 1852 another Englishman had undertaken to convey  500 alpacas to England, but, despite the utmost care during the voyage,  only three were landed alive. Waddington attributed this disaster to the  want of fresh food, and therefore hit upon the expedient of accustoming  those animals which he intended to send to Australia to the use of dry  fodder, such as barley, bran, and hay, for some time before their  embarkation. As soon as they had become somewhat inured they were shipped  at Caldera, near Copiapo, and entrusted to the care of Mexican Indians  accustomed to their habits, for transport to Australia. The vessel was of  800 tons burthen, and was chartered at 6000 dollars for the voyage. The  fitting up of the vessel for her novel cargo cost about 300 dollars. Each  animal, in addition to its ration of dried food, had a quart of water per  diem. The voyage from Caldera to Sydney took 70 days. Of 316 llamas  shipped or born on the voyage only 36 died, 280 arriving in excellent  health at Sydney, and were with all speed turned into a large pasture on  the Government domain.[23] For weeks the negotiations remained in an  anxious suspense, in consequence of the original projector of the  undertaking, an adventurous Yankee, named Ledger, who had purchased the  animals in the interior of Peru, and after four years of unwearied  assiduity had accompanied his charge hither, standing out for a large sum  by way of reward. Long after we had left Sydney we learned that the 280  llamas were sold to a company of sheep-breeders at L25 a head, or for  L7000 sterling the entire herd, the value of an animal in Peru being two  or three dollars.    The yield of the various gold-fields[24] in the west, north, and south of  the colony, though nothing like so great as in the neighbouring colony of  Victoria, yet contributes in no inconsiderable degree to the annual  revenue of the state, and maintains a considerable commerce with other  countries. According to official reports, the amount of gold taken out  since its first discovery in March, 1851, to the end of July, 1860, was  2,587,549 oz., worth about L9,600,000. Besides this, however, a  considerable quantity of money was brought to the coast by private  conveyance, where it was smelted down, since the entire yield of New South  Wales in nine years was L12,696,231, besides L3,096,231 in the State  Treasury and Mint, according to official returns.    The rumour that gold was to be found in Australia was first set on foot by  the Rev. H. F. Clarke, a Protestant missionary and well-known geologist,  who so far back as 1841 found gold in the hills W. of Vale of Clyde, and  had even then proved to several influential personages by unmistakeable  evidence the existence of gold-quartz, with the remark that in Australia,  especially the province of Victoria, all scientific indications were in  favour of there being a great amount of gold. But the learned country  parson found at that time little attention or interest, as well in  consequence of its then being still a penal colony, as of the ignorance at  that period universally prevalent as to the value of such indications.    Ten years later a certain Mr. Hargrave adopted the rational course of  visiting California, where he made himself master of the various means of  obtaining gold, after which he returned, and commenced to wash for gold in  Summer Hill Creek, Victoria, and thus became the practical discoverer of  the gold-fields, the special contributor to the development of the  resources of the country. The committee of the Legislative Council, to  whom was entrusted to examine and report upon the claims of individuals as  to the honour of having discovered the Australian gold-fields, added to  the minute of 10th March, 1841, that Mr. Hargrave, who had so  disinterestedly thrown open to all this inexhaustible mine of wealth,  ought to receive L5000, and Rev. W. H. Clarke L1000 in recognition of his  mineralogical researches, which had conduced to the same result. The first  Australian gold, 18 oz. in weight, was landed in London by the _Honduras_  on 20th August, 1851.

If, then, we have a number  of branches, as indicated in Fig. 4, the current will divide itself  equally among the branches when the resistances of the branches are  equal. This is the arrangement adopted by Mr. Werdermann, as will be  seen from the annexed diagram, Fig. 5, in which N and P represent  the negative and positive poles of the machine, and L L the electric  lamps.    When any one lamp is put out the inventor arranges that an equivalent  resistance shall be put into the circuit, so that as a whole the  circuit is unaltered, and the other lamps unaffected.           *       *       *       *       *          CASSON'S SAW BENCH.      We give herewith a perspective view of a circular saw bench made by  Messrs. Oliver & Co. (Limited), of Chesterfield, England, which we  take from _Engineering_. The chief features in this machine are that  it is fitted with Mr. John Casson's patent feed gear and apparatus for  steadying the saws. This feeding arrangement has now been in use some  years, and has been fitted to a very large number of circular saw  benches. This being the case, and the arrangement being very clearly  shown by our engraving, it will be unnecessary for us to describe it  in detail here.    The saw-steadying apparatus, with which the saw bench we illustrate  is fitted, is a novel arrangement, recently patented by Mr. Casson; in  the present case it is applied to two saws.    The steadying arrangement consists of accurately fitted sliding jaws  mounted on the arms of a forked support, so that they can be moved and  adjusted only by fine threaded screws, the jaws having their surfaces  next the saws, accurately parallel with the plane of the collar of the  saw spindle; these jaws, A, are fixed when the adjusting screws are at  rest, and they are faced with strips of greenheart or other suitable  timber, secured by countersunk screw bolts, these faces forming a  perfectly true guide for the saw blades.    For a single saw the guides just described would suffice; but for two  or more saws the outside guides must be supplemented by others between  the saw blades.    It will be noticed that the support, F, carrying the guiding jaws, has  a square stem sliding through the head of a suitable standard, and it  can be readily fixed at any desired height by means of the set screw.    [Illustration: BENCH WITH SAW-STEADYING APPARATUS.]    The arrangement we have been describing is well carried out, and there  can be no doubt that it will do good service, and enable thin saws  to be efficiently used with a heavy feed. We have received very  satisfactory reports of its performance.           *       *       *       *       *          A BAIT FOR INVENTORS.      I will give $200 for a machine that will bale hay in the field. Rake  and press combined would be preferable, but would not object to  its taking the hay in the windrow. The machine must be expeditious,  executing as fast as a mower is able to cut. Must have sufficient  power to make a bale suitable for commercial uses; shape of the bale  immaterial; a round one preferred. Must be of light draught; one team  is generally all that is available for any machine on the farm. These,  with the other qualifications demanded of every machine, simplicity,  durability, easy to manage, etc. If such an invention could be  produced it would make a revolution in the hay field almost equal to  that which the mower has made.    What an awkward, ungainly spectacle a man presents, struggling at one  end of a six foot pole, with a ten pound lock of hay at the other end,  endeavoring with all his might and main to elevate it 12 or 15 feet on  top of a load! It is an insult to human intelligence. A load of loose  hay is an uncertain quantity. You are never sure of getting it into  the barn. Top heavy, one sided, too wide or too high for the doors;  and even with the best of luck, a good percentage has drizzled in the  wake of the wagon over the lot to the barn. A 100 or 200 lb. bale,  with an inclined plane, or a pulley on side or aft of a good strong  rack, and all this barbarism has succumbed to civilization.    At the barn comes a worse servitude. (I don't mean the horse fork;  that is a grand lift to civilization. I hope to modify it shortly to  throw bales.) There a man struggles with sheer desperation to press  by his own avoirdupois 20 tons of hay into a place that won't hold 10.  Tramp, tramp, tramp, leg-weary, panting like an overheated dog, every  fiber of his clothing saturated with perspiration, a subject worthy  of a better immortality than the Greek slave. O Edison! don't fritter  away your genius on sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. Elevate the  laborer. Liberate our overworked people. Make us a chariot to press  our hay.--_Edmund Adams, North Manlius, N. Y., to the New York  Tribune._           *       *       *       *       *          A SILVER MILL IN THE CLOUDS.      The largest and most complete silver mill ever constructed, says the  San Francisco Stock Report, has recently been built by Messrs. Rankin,  Brayton & Co., of the Pacific Iron Works of that city, for the Cerro  de Pasco Mining Company, of Peru, and shipped for Callao, the port of  destination. This enormous mill consists of 80 stamps, 900 lbs, each,  44 live foot amalgamating pans, 22 nine foot settlers, and all the  accessories of a first-class modern mill. It is to be erected upon the  above named mines, which are situated in the heart of the Andes,  some 150 miles east of the city of Lima, at an elevation of more than  14,000 feet. To admit of mule transportation a portion of the way up  this tremendous ascent, the mill had to be made in sections, no piece  weighing more than 500 lbs. Some idea of the magnitude of this work  may be inferred from the fact that the mill, as thus constructed,  consisted of more than 17,000 pieces, and weighed upward of 600 tons.  This enormous amount of machinery was constructed by the above firm  and put on board a ship 50 days from date of contract.    The Cerro de Pasco mines have been the richest and most famous in the  world's history. They have been worked by the old arastra process for  the past 200 years, and have produced, according to the most authentic  records, more than $500,000,000. With such improved machinery the  product of these mines will undoubtedly attract the attention of the  world, and so reflect great credit upon the capacity, ingenuity, and  skill of our mechanical establishments.           *       *       *       *       *          POULTICES.      The common practice in making poultices of mixing the linseed meal  with hot water, and applying them directly to the skin, is quite  wrong, because, if we do not wish to burn the patient, we must wait  until a great portion of the heat has been lost. The proper method  is to take a flannel bag (the size of the poultice required), to fill  this with the linseed poultice as hot as it can possibly be made, and  to put between this and the skin a second piece of flannel, so that  there shall be at least two thicknesses of flannel between the skin  and the poultice itself. Above the poultice should be placed more  flannel, or a piece of cotton wool, to prevent it from getting cold.  By this method we are able to apply the linseed meal boiling hot,  without burning the patient, and the heat, gradually diffusing through  the flannel, affords a grateful sense of relief which cannot be  obtained by other means. There are few ways in which such marked  relief is given to abdominal pain as by the application of a poultice  in this manner.--_Dr. T. Lauder Brunton, in Brain._           *       *       *       *       *          NEW MECHANICAL INVENTIONS.      Mr. Joseph Adams, of Washington, D. C., has patented an improved Gas  Regulator, designed either to cut off the gas entirely or to let on  a larger amount of gas than its automatic action would ordinarily  permit, or to allow the regulator to operate with an automatic action,  as usual.    Mr. Jean A. Hitter, Jr., of St. Martinsville, La., has patented an  improved Type Writer, of simple and compact construction, that may be  readily used for printing on paper and for other purposes, being  small enough to be carried conveniently in the pocket, if desired, and  readily operated with little practice.    Messrs. Edwin N. Boynton, Geo. M. Coburn, and Thos. F. Carver, of  Worcester, Mass., have patented an improved Hand Drilling Machine, by  which a fast or slow motion can be readily obtained, at the will  of the operator, the slower motion being especially advantageous in  drilling large holes, as more power is obtained, and the holes are  drilled with greater ease.    Mr. Reuben R. James, of Rising Sun, Ind., has devised an improved  Adding Machine of simple and comparatively inexpensive construction.  The chief feature of the machine is a series of toothed revolving  counting wheels, which are inscribed on their peripheries with the  nine digits and cipher, and mounted loosely on a common axis, and each  having four lateral inclines or cams, which cause, at the proper time,  a weighted pawl lever to engage the next counting wheel on the left,  so as to carry ten when the numbers added on the wheel on the right  exceed ten. The adding is effected by successively drawing down to a  stop on the finger board the teeth of the counting wheels which are  opposite the numbers to be added, and the numerical result will be  seen on the wheels in a series of slots or apertures in the case of  the machine.    Mr. Jacob Croft, of Scipio, Utah Ter., has devised an improved Turbine  Water Wheel, which is constructed to prevent back pressure by the  water against the casing as it escapes from the buckets. Sand and  other substances in the water are prevented from entering around the  shaft and cutting or wearing it.    An improvement in Sweeping Machines has been patented by Mr. Isaac  A.
