Mr. Trimble was one of those queer people who believe all a boy is  good for is doing mischief and all a boy deserves is scolding or  beating. Perhaps this was because he had no sons of his own and  therefore had no regard for the sons of other people.    Mr. Mason went directly to the cornfield with his neighbor. He looked  carefully over every hill, and with a spade and hoe he was able to put  back into place the few stalks that had been knocked down in Sable's  flight.    \"There now,\" said Mr. Mason, \"I guess that corn is as good as ever. If  it wants any more hoeing Tom will come around in the morning and do it.  He is too stiff to move to-night.\"    So that ended the runaway, except for a very lame boy, Tom Mason, who  had to limp around for a day or two from stiffness.    \"How would you like to be a jockey!\" laughed his companions. \"You held  on like a champion, but you were not in training for the banging you  got.\"    \"Well, I guess Sable will make a fine racehorse,\" said Tom, \"when he's  broken. But it will take someone stronger than I am to break him in.\"    The next afternoon all the boys went fishing. They had been out quite  late the night before to find the \"night walkers\" for bait, as those  little worms only come out of the ground after dark. Bert had a new  line his father brought from Lakeport, and the others boys had nets and  hooks, as most country boys who live near streams are always fond of  fishing.    \"Let's go over to the cove,\" Harry said when they all started off.  \"There's lots of good fish in that dark corner.\"    So the cove was chosen as a good spot to fish from, and soon the  Bobbsey boys and their friends were lying around the edge of the deep  clear stream, waiting for a bite.    Bert was the first to jerk his line, and he brought it up with such  force that the chubfish on his hook slapped Harry right in the face!    \"Look out!\" called Harry, trying to dodge the flapping fish. \"Put your  catch down. He's a good one, but I don't care about having him kiss me  that way again.\"    All the boys laughed at Bert, who was a green fisherman they said. The  fish was really a very nice plump chub and weighed more than a pound.  He floundered around in the basket and flapped his tail wildly trying  to get away from them.    \"I've got one,\" called Tom next, at the same moment pulling his line  and bringing up a pretty little sunfish. Now \"sunnies\" are not  considered good eating, so Tom's catch did not come up to Bert's, but  it was put in the basket just the same.    \"I'm going out on the springboard,\" August Stout announced, stepping  cautiously out on the board from which good swimmers dived.    \"You know you can't swim, August,\" said Harry, \"and if you get a catch  and jerk it you'll tumble in.\"    \"Oh! I'll be all right,\" August answered, lying down flat on the narrow  springboard and dropping his line.    For a time all the boys lay watching for a bite. No one spoke, for  sometimes they say fish are very sensitive to sound and go in another  direction if they hear a voice.    It was a beautiful July day, and perhaps the boys were a little lazy.  At any rate, they all became so quiet the little woodpeckers on the  trees went on with their work pecking at the tree bark as if no human  being was in sight.    Suddenly there was a big splash!    \"August!\" yelled all the boys at once, for indeed August was gone from  the springboard.    \"Quick!\" called Harry to his companions. \"He can't swim!\"    The next minute the boy in the water came to the top and threw up his  arm. But no one was near enough to reach it.    \"Strike out, August!\" yelled Bert. \"We're coming,\" and one boy after  the other dropped in the water now, having thrown off their heavy  clothing.    \"Oh, where is he?\" screamed Bert in terror, for no movement on the  water's surface showed them where August was.    \"Here!\" cried Tom Mason, who was quite a distance out. \"Here he is!  Help! come quick!\"    No need to urge the boys to hasten, for all realized the danger their  companion was in.    \"Don't pull down, August,\" went on Tom. \"Try to help yourself, or  you'll pull me under.\" Harry had around his neck a strong piece of rope  he picked up as he made a dive into the water.    \"Take hold of this,\" he called to August, \"and we can all pull.\"    As the rope was put in August's hand the other boys all took hold and  soon towed the unfortunate boy in.    \"He's very weak,\" said Harry when they pulled August up on the shore.  \"I guess he has swallowed a lot of water. We better roll him on the  grass and work his arms up and down. That will revive him.\"    August was indeed very weak, and had had a narrow escape. For some time  his companions worked over him before he opened his eyes and spoke.    \"Oh!\" he murmured at last, \"I'm so sick!\"    \"I guess you are, August,\" said Tom, \"but you'll be all right soon.\"  They lifted him carefully under a shady tree and removed his wet  clothing.    \"I'll run over to Smith's and get him something to wear home,\" said  Harry, who hurried across lots and presently returned with an old suit  of clothes. August was able to dress himself now, and as soon as he  felt strong enough the boys helped him home.    \"You can have my fish, August,\" said Bert nobly.    \"And mine too,\" Tom added. August did not want to accept the boys'  offers at first, but at last they prevailed upon him to do so.    \"I think I fell asleep,\" said he, referring to the accident.    \"Guess we all did!\" added Harry, \"for we only woke up when we heard the  splash.\"    It seems the number of accidents country boys have only make them truer  friends, for all the things that happened in Meadow Brook made each boy  think more of his companions both in being grateful for the help given  and being glad no dear friend's life was lost.        CHAPTER XIII    PICKING PEAS    \"Mother,\" said Harry, using that loved name to show that what he was  about to say was something important, \"Peter Burns is sick. He has not  been able to work since the cannon exploded and gave him the shock, and  all his peas are spoiling because there's no one to pick them. Mrs.  Burns hired some boys yesterday, but they broke down so many vines she  had to stop them; and, mother, would you mind if Bert and I picked some  to-day? The sun is not hot.\"    \"Why, my dear,\" replied Aunt Sarah, \"it would be very nice of you to  help Peter; he has always been a kind neighbor. I don't think it would  do you any harm to pick peas on a cool day like this. Bert can ask his  mother, and if she is satisfied you can put on your play overalls and  go right along.\"    Both boys were given the desired permission, and when Tom and Jack  heard where the Bobbseys were going they said at once they would go  along.    \"Are you sure your mother won't mind?\" Mrs. Burns asked the boys,  knowing Harry's folks did not need the money paid to pick the peas. \"Of  course I'm very glad to have you if your mothers are satisfied.\"    Soon each boy had a big basket under his arm, and was off for the  beautiful field of soft green peas, that stretched along the pond bank  at the side of Mrs. Burns' home. Now, peas are quite an expensive  vegetable when they come in first, and farmers who have big fields of  them depend upon the return from the crop as an important part of the  summer's income. But the peas must be picked just as soon as they are  ripe, or else they will spoil. This was why Harry got his friends to  turn in to help poor Peter Burns.    \"I'll go down this row and you take that.\" suggested Bert to Harry.  \"Then we can talk to each other without hollering.\"    \"All right,\" Harry replied, snapping the peas off the vines and  dropping them into his basket like a real farmer.    \"Let's have a race,\" called Tom. \"See who gets his basket full first.\"    \"But no skipping for big ones,\" put in Jack. \"You have to pick every  ripe one.\"    The boys all started in at the top of the hill, each working two rows  at a time. They were so interested in the race that scarcely a word was  spoken. The peas were plentiful and ripe too, so that the baskets were  filling up quickly. Mrs. Burns herself was picking, in fact she had  been in the field since the very first peep of dawn, and she would be  sure to stay out until the darkness would drive her in.    \"You are fine pickers,\" she told the boys, seeing how quickly they  worked. \"I pay ten cents a basket, you know.\"    \"I guess we can earn a dollar a day at this rate,\" laughed Tom, whose  basket was almost full.    \"I'm done,\" called Jack from his row.    \"No, you're not,\" said Harry, \"you have to cover the rim.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Jack, who had just slipped between the rows. \"Oh! there  goes my basket.\"    And sure enough the big basket had been upset in Jack's fall, and most  of the peas were scattered on the ground.    \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Bert. \"I'm first. My basket is full.\"    \"I'm next!\" called Tom, picking his basket up in his arms.    \"Well, I'll be last I guess,\" laughed Tom, trying hard to pick up the  scattered peas.    \"There's mine!\" called Harry, and now all the boys carried their  baskets to the big bag at the end of the field and dumped them in.    \"It won't take long to fill the bag,\" said Harry, \"and it will be so  good for Peter to have them ready, for to-morrow is market day.\"    So the boys worked on right along until lunch time, each having picked  four big baskets full. August Stout came along and helped some too, but  he could not stay long, as he had to cut some clothes poles for his  mother.    \"Well, I declare!\" said Mrs. Burns, looking at the three full bags the  boys had picked. \"Isn't that splendid! But I can't pay until Peter  comes from market.\"    \"We just did it for fun,\" answered Harry. \"We don't want any pay.\"    \"Indeed you must have forty cents apiece, ten cents a basket,\" she  insisted. \"See what a good load you have picked!\"    \"No, really, Mrs. Burns; mother wouldn't like us to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7140"],[0,"The Great Conspiracy, Complete (#11)"],[1,"freedom to  which they dedicated their lives, as you prize the peace of your  country, the lives of its best citizens, and your own fair fame, to  retrace your steps.

[In this connection the following letter, written at that time by       the great Chief Justice Marshall, to a cousin of his, on the       subject of State Sovereignty, is of interest, as showing how       clearly his penetrating intellect perceived the dangers to the       Union hidden in the plausible doctrine of State Rights:         RICHMOND, May 7, 1833.         \"MY DEAR SIR:         \"I am much indebted to you for your pamphlet on Federal Relations,       which I have read with much satisfaction.  No subject, as it seems       to me, is more misunderstood or more perverted.  You have brought       into view numerous important historical facts which, in my       judgment, remove the foundation on which the Nullifiers and       Seceders have erected that superstructure which overshadows our       Union.  You have, I think, shown satisfactorily that we never have       been perfectly distinct, independent societies, sovereign in the       sense in which the Nullifiers use the term.  When colonies we       certainly were not.  We were parts of the British empire, and       although not directly connected with each other so far as respected       government, we were connected in many respects, and were united to       the same stock.  The steps we took to effect separation were, as       you have fully shown, not only revolutionary in their nature, but       they were taken conjointly.  Then, as now, we acted in many       respects as one people.  The representatives of each colony acted       for all.  Their resolutions proceeded from a common source, and       operated on the whole mass.  The army was a continental army       commanded by a continental general, and supported from a       continental treasury.  The Declaration of Independence was made by       a common government, and was made for all the States.         \"Everything has been mixed.  Treaties made by Congress have been       considered as binding all the States.  Some powers have been       exercised by Congress, some by the States separately.  The lines       were not strictly drawn.  The inability of Congress to carry its       legitimate powers into execution has gradually annulled those       powers practically, but they always existed in theory.       Independence was declared `in the name and by the authority of the       good people of these colonies.' In fact we have always been united       in some respects, separate in others.  We have acted as one people       for some purposes, as distinct societies for others.  I think you       have shown this clearly, and in so doing have demonstrated the       fallacy of the principle on which either nullification or the right       of peaceful, constitutional secession is asserted.         \"The time is arrived when these truths must be more generally       spoken, or our Union is at an end.  The idea of complete       sovereignty of the State converts our government into a league,       and, if carried into practice, dissolves the Union.         \"I am, dear sir,         \"Yours affectionately,         \"J.

But after-events proved conclusively that the enactment of this  Compromise Tariff was a terrible blunder, if not a crime.  Jackson had  fully intended to hang Calhoun and his nullifying coadjutors if they  persisted in their Treason.  He knew that they had only seized upon the  Tariff laws as a pretext with which to justify Disunion, and prophesied  that \"the next will be the Slavery or Negro question.\"  Jackson's  forecast was correct.  Free Trade, Slavery and Secession were from that  time forward sworn allies; and the ruin wrought to our industries by the  disasters of 1840, plainly traceable to that Compromise Tariff measure  of 1833, was only to be supplemented by much greater ruin and disasters  caused by the Free Trade Tariff of 1846--and to be followed by the armed  Rebellion of the Free Trade and Pro-Slavery States of the South in 1861,  in a mad attempt to destroy the Union.                                        CHAPTER III.                        GROWTH OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION.      It will be remembered that during the period of the Missouri Struggle,  1818-1820, the Territory of Arkansas was formed by an Act of Congress  out of that part of the Missouri Territory not included in the proposed  State of Missouri, and that the Act so creating the Territory of  Arkansas contained no provision restricting Slavery.  Early in 1836, the  people of Arkansas Territory met in Convention and formed a Constitution  under which, \"and by virtue of the treaty of cession by France to the  United States, of the Province of Louisiana,\" they asked admission to  the Union as a State.  Among other provisions of that Constitution was a  section rendering the State Legislature powerless to pass laws for the  emancipation of slaves without the consent of the owners, or to prevent  emigrants to that State from bringing with them slaves.  On June 15th of  the same year, Arkansas was, under that Constitution, admitted to the  Union as a Slave State, with the sole reservation, that nothing in the  Act of admission should be \"construed as an assent by Congress to all or  any of the propositions contained\" in the said Constitution.     Long ere this, all the Northern and Middle States had made provision for  the emancipation of such slaves as remained within their borders, and  only a few years previous (in 1829 and 1831-32) Virginia had made strong  but insufficient efforts toward the same end.  The failure to free  Virginia of Slavery--the effort to accomplish which had been made by  some of the greatest of her statesmen--only served to rivet the chains  of human bondage more securely throughout all the Slave States, and from  that time on, no serious agitation occurred in any one of them, looking  toward even the most gradual emancipation.  On the other hand, the  advocates of the extension of the Slave-Power by the expansion of  Slave-territory, were ever on the alert, they considered it of the last  importance to maintain the balance of power between the Slave States and  the Free States.  Hence, while they had secured in 1819 the cession from  Spain to the United States of the Slave-holding Floridas, and the  organization of the Slave Territory of Florida in 1822--which  subsequently came in as a Slave State under the same Act (1845) that  admitted the Free State of Iowa--their greedy eyes were now cast upon  the adjoining rich territories of Mexico.    Efforts had (in 1827-1829) been made to purchase from Mexico the domain  which was known as Texas.  They had failed.  But already a part of Texas  had been settled by adventurous Americans under Mexican grants and  otherwise; and General Sam Houston, an adherent of the Slave Power,  having become a leading spirit among them, fomented a revolution.  In  March, 1836, Texas, under his guidance, proclaimed herself a Republic  independent of Mexico.    The War that ensued between Texas and Mexico ended in the flight of the  Mexican Army and the capture of Santa Anna at San Jacinto, and a treaty  recognizing Texan independence.  In October, 1836, General Houston "]]]
