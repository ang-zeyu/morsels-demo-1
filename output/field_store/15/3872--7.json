This is  that, after the anthropological classification which I have  maintained for some ten years past, all who have been devoting  themselves to the subject of crime as regarded from a biological  and social standpoint have recognised the need for a  classification less simple than that of habitual and occasional  criminals, and which will be more or less complex according to the  criterion which may be adopted.  <p 48>    In the first place, the necessity is generally recognised of  abandoning the old arbitrary and algebraic type in favour of a  classification which shall correspond more accurately with the  facts of the case.  This classification, originating in  observations made within the prison walls, I have extended in the  domain of criminal sociology, wherein it is now established as a  fundamental criterion of legislative measures which must be taken  as a protection against criminals, as well as a criterion of their  responsibility.    Secondly, the classifications of criminals hitherto given are not  essentially and integrally distinct.  It has been seen, as a  matter of fact, that all the classifications which have been set  forth amount to a recognition of four types, the born, the insane,  the occasional criminals, and the criminals of passion; and this  again resolves itself into the simple and primitive distinction  between occasional and instinctive criminals.  The category of  criminals by contracted habit would not be accepted by all  observers, but it corresponds too closely to our daily experience  to stand in need of further proof.  And on the other hand I must  frankly decline to accept the authority of those who put forward  classifications more or less symmetrical without having made a  direct study of criminals; for the experimental method does not  admit systems based on mere imagination, or on vague recollections  of criminal trials, or on argumentative constructions built up  from the systems of others.    As a matter of fact, apart from the differences <p 49>of  nomenclature, it is evident that the partial discrepancies in this  anthropological classification of criminals are due in some  measure to the different points of view taken by observers.  For  instance, the classification of Lacassagne, Joly, Krauss, Badik,  and Marro rest upon a purely descriptive criterion of the organic  or psychological characteristics of criminals.  The  classifications of Liszt, Medem, and Minzloff, on the other hand,  depend solely upon the curative and defensive influence of  punishment; and those of Foehring and Starke upon certain special  points of view, such as the assistance of released prisoners, on  their tendency to relapse.    My own point of view, on the contrary, has been general and  reproductive, for my classification is based upon the natural  causes of crime, individual, physical, and social, and to this  extent it corresponds more closely with the theoretical and  practical requirements of criminal sociology.  If the curative art  of society, like that of individuals, expects from positive  knowledge an indication of remedies, it is clear that a  classification based on the fundamental causes of crime is best  fitted to indicate a social cure for this manifestation of  disease, which is the essential object of criminal sociology.  For, as in biology one is carried from purely descriptive anatomy  to genetic anatomy and physiology, so in sociology we must pass on  from purely legal descriptions of crimes to the genetic knowledge  of the criminals who commit these crimes.    For this reason all the chief classifications of criminals, as has  been seen, may be brought into <p 50>line with my own, by virtue  of the more complete and fruitful test which has established it.  And thus we have a manifest proof that this classification  actually represents the common and permanent basis of all the  chief anthropological categories of criminals, whether in regard  to their natural causality and their specific character, or in  regard to the different forms of social self-defence which spring  out of them, and which must be adapted to the natural causes of  crime, and to the principal criminal types.    But whatever classification may be accepted, we shall always have,  as the fundamental axiom of criminal anthropology, this variety in  the types of criminals, which must henceforth be indispensable to  all who are theoretically or practically concerned with crime.        CHAPTER II.    _THE DATA OF CRIMINAL STATISTICS._    FOR moral and social facts, unlike physical and biological facts,  experiment is very difficult, and frequently even impossible;  observation in this domain brings the greatest aid to scientific  research.  And statistics are amongst the most efficacious  instruments of such observation.    It is natural, therefore, that criminal sociology, after studying  the individual aspect of the natural genesis of crime, should have  recourse to criminal statistics for the study of the social  aspect.  Statistical information in the words of Krohne, ``is the  first condition of success in opposing the armies of crime, for it  discharges the same function as the Intelligence department in  war.''    From statistics, in fact, the modern idea of the close relation  between offences and the conditions of social life, in some of its  aspects, and above all in certain particular forms, has most  directly sprung.    The science of criminal statistics is to criminal sociology what  histology is to biology, for it exhibits, in the conditions of the  individual elements of the collective organism, the factors of  crime as a<p 51> <p 52>social phenomenon.  And that not only for  scientific inductions, but also for practical and legislative  purposes; for, as Lord Brougham said at the London Statistical  Congress in 1860, ``criminal statistics are for the legislator  what the chart and the compass are for the navigator.''      The experimental school, accepting the fundamental and  incontestible idea, apart from its numerical and optimistic  exaggerations, that the statistics of crime must be considered in  regard to the growth and activity of the population, has opened up  an entirely new channel of fruitful observations, in the  classification and study of the natural factors of crime.    In my ``Studies of Crime in France'' (1881) I arranged in three  natural orders the whole series of causes leading to crime, which  had previously been indicated in a fragmentary and incomplete  manner.[12]        [12] Bentham, in his ``Introduction to the Principles of Morals  and Legislation,'' enumerates the following circumstances as  necessary to be considered in legislation:--temperament, health,  strength, physical imperfections, culture, intellectual faculties,  strength of mind, dispositions, ideas of honour and religion,  feelings of sympathy and antipathy, insanity, economic conditions,  sex, age, social status, education, profession, climate, race,  government, religious profession.    Lombroso, in the second edition of his ``Criminal,'' which  embraces all the divisions of his classical work, has made but a  rapid enumeration of the principal points:--race civilisation,  poverty, heredity, age sex, civil status, profession, education,  organic anomalies, sensations imitation.  Morselli, treating of  suicide, has given a fuller classification of its contributory  causes:--worldly or natural influences, ethnical or demographical  influences, social influences, biopsychical influences.        From the consideration that human actions, whether honest or  dishonest, social or anti-social, are always the outcome of a  man's physio-psychical organism, and of the physical and social  atmosphere which surrounds him, I have drawn attention to  <p 53>the _anthropological_ or individual factors of crime, the  _physical_ factors, and the _social_ factors.    The anthropological factors, inherent in the individual criminal,  are the first condition of crime; and they may be divided into  three sub-classes, according as we regard the criminal organically  physically, or socially.    _The organic constitution of the criminal_ comprises all anomalies  of the skull, the brain, the vital organs, the sensibility, and  the reflex activity, and all the bodily characteristics taken  together, such as the physiognomy, tattooing, and so on.    _The mental constitution of the criminal_ comprises anomalies of  intelligence and feeling, especially of the moral sense, and the  specialities of criminal writing and slang.    _The personal characteristics of the criminal_ comprise his purely  biological conditions, such as race, age, sex; bio-social  conditions, such as civil status, profession, domicile, social  rank, instruction, education, which have hitherto been regarded as  almost the exclusive concern of criminal statistics.    _The physical factors_ of crime are climate, the nature of the  soil, the relative length of day and night, the seasons, the  average temperature, meteoric conditions, agricultural pursuits.    _The social factors_ comprise the density of population; public  opinion, manners and religion; family circumstances; the system of  education; industrial pursuits; alcoholism; economic and political  conditions; public administration, justice and police; and in  general, legislative, civil and penal institutions.  <p 54>We have  here a host of latent causes, commingling and combining in all  parts of the social organism, which generally escape the notice  both of theorists and of practical men, of criminologists and of  legislators.    This classification of the natural factors of crime, which has  indeed been accepted by almost all criminal anthropologists and  sociologists, seems to me more precise and complete than any other  which has been proposed.    In respect of this classification of the natural factors of crime,  it is"]]]
