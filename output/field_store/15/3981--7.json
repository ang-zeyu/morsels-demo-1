We  wished to examine its teeth, and the inside of its mouth; but having  been exposed to the sun for several weeks, it exhaled a smell so fetid  that we were obliged to relinquish our design and remount our horses.  When we arrived at the level of the sea, the road turned eastward, and  crossed a barren shore a league and a half broad, resembling that of  Cumana. We there found some scattered cactuses, a sesuvium, a few  plants of Coccoloba uvifera, and along the coast some avicennias and  mangroves. We forded the Guayguaza and the Rio Estevan, which, by  their frequent overflowing, form great pools of stagnant water. Small  rocks of meandrites, madrepores, and other corals, either ramified or  with a rounded surface, rise in this vast plain, and seem to attest  the recent retreat of the sea. But these masses, which are the  habitations of polypi, are only fragments imbedded in a breccia with a  calcareous cement. I say a breccia, because we must not confound the  fresh and white corallites of this very recent littoral formation,  with the corallites blended in the mass of transition-rocks,  grauwacke, and black limestone. We were astonished to find in this  uninhabited spot a large Parkinsonia aculeata loaded with flowers. Our  botanical works indicate this tree as peculiar to the New World; but  during five years we saw it only twice in a wild state, once in the  plains of the Rio Guayguaza, and once in the llanos of Cumana, thirty  leagues from the coast, near la Villa del Pao, but there was reason to  believe that this latter place had once been a conuco, or cultivated  enclosure. Everywhere else on the continent of America we saw the  Parkinsonia, like the Plumeria, only in the gardens of the Indians.    At Porto Cabello, as at La Guayra, it is disputed whether the port  lies east or west of the town, with which the communications are the  most frequent. The inhabitants believe that Porto Cabello is  north-north-west of Nueva Valencia; and my observations give a  longitude of three or four minutes more towards the west.    We were received with the utmost kindness in the house of a French  physician, M. Juliac, who had studied medicine at Montpelier. His  small house contained a collection of things the most various, but  which were all calculated to interest travellers. We found works of  literature and natural history; notes on meteorology; skins of the  jaguar and of large aquatic serpents; live animals, monkeys,  armadilloes, and birds. Our host was principal surgeon to the royal  hospital of Porto Cabello, and was celebrated in the country for his  skilful treatment of the yellow fever. During a period of seven years  he had seen six or eight thousand persons enter the hospitals,  attacked by this cruel malady. He had observed the ravages that the  epidemic caused in Admiral Ariztizabal's fleet, in 1793. That fleet  lost nearly a third of its men; for the sailors were almost all  unseasoned Europeans, and held unrestrained intercourse with the  shore. M. Juliac had heretofore treated the sick as was commonly  practised in Terra Firma, and in the island, by bleeding, aperient  medicines, and acid drinks. In this treatment no attempt was made to  raise the vital powers by the action of stimulants, so that, in  attempting to allay the fever, the languor and debility were  augmented. In the hospitals, where the sick were crowded, the  mortality was often thirty-three per cent among the white Creoles; and  sixty-five in a hundred among the Europeans recently disembarked.  Since a stimulant treatment, the use of opium, of benzoin, and of  alcoholic draughts, has been substituted for the old debilitating  method, the mortality has considerably diminished. It was believed to  be reduced to twenty in a hundred among Europeans, and ten among  Creoles;* even when black vomiting, and haemorrhage from the nose,  ears, and gums, indicated a high degree of exacerbation in the malady.  (* I have treated in another work of the proportions of mortality in  the yellow fever. (Nouvelle Espagne volume 2 pages 777, 785, and 867.)  At Cadiz the average mortality was, in 1800, twenty per cent; at  Seville, in 1801, it amounted to sixty per cent. At Vera Cruz the  mortality does not exceed twelve or fifteen per cent, when the sick  can be properly attended. In the civil hospitals of Paris the number  of deaths, one year with another, is from fourteen to eighteen per  cent; but it is asserted that a great number of patients enter the  hospitals almost dying, or at very advanced time of life.) I relate  faithfully what was then given as the general result of observation:  but I think, in these numerical comparisons, it must not be forgotten,  that, notwithstanding appearances, the epidemics of several successive  years do not resemble each other; and that, in order to decide on the  use of fortifying or debilitating remedies, (if indeed this difference  exist in an absolute sense,) we must distinguish between the various  periods of the malady.    The climate of Porto Cabello is less ardent than that of La Guayra.  The breeze there is stronger, more frequent, and more regular. The  houses do not lean against rocks that absorb the rays of the sun  during the day, and emit caloric at night, and the air can circulate  more freely between the coast and the mountains of Ilaria. The causes  of the insalubrity of the atmosphere must be sought in the shores that  extend to the east, as far as the eye can reach, towards the Punta de  Tucasos, near the fine port of Chichiribiche. There are situated the  salt-works; and there, at the beginning of the rainy season, tertian  fevers prevail, and easily degenerate into asthenic fevers. It is  affirmed that the mestizoes who are employed in the salt-works are  more tawny, and have a yellower skin, when they have suffered several  successive years from those fevers, which are called the malady of the  coast. The poor fishermen, who dwell on this shore, are of opinion  that it is not the inundations of the sea, and the retreat of the  salt-water, which render the lands covered with mangroves so  unhealthful;* (* In the West India Islands all the dreadful maladies  which prevail during the wintry season, have been for a long time  attributed to the south winds. These winds convey the emanations of  the mouths of the Orinoco and of the small rivers of Terra Firma  toward the high latitudes.) they believe that the insalubrity of the  air is owing to the fresh water, that is, to the overflowings of the  Guayguaza and Estevan, the swell of which is so great and sudden in  the months of October and November. The banks of the Rio Estevan have  been less insalubrious since little plantations of maize and plantains  have been established; and, by raising and hardening the ground, the  river has been confined within narrower limits. A plan is formed of  giving another issue to the Rio San Estevan, and thus to render the  environs of Porto Cabello more wholesome. A canal is to lead the  waters toward that part of the coast which is opposite the island of  Guayguaza.    The salt-works of Porto Cabello somewhat resemble those of the  peninsula of Araya, near Cumana. The earth, however, which they  lixivate by collecting the rain-water into small basins, contains less  salt. It is questioned here, as at Cumana, whether the ground be  impregnated with saline particles because it has been for ages covered  at intervals with sea-water evaporated by the heat of the sun, or  whether the soil be muriatiferous, as in a mine very poor in native  salt. I had not leisure to examine this plain with the same attention  as the peninsula of Araya. Besides, does not this problem reduce  itself to the simple question, whether the salt be owing to new or  very ancient inundations? The labouring at the salt-works of Porto  Cabello being extremely unhealthy, the poorest men alone engage in it.  They collect the salt in little stores, and afterwards sell it to the  shopkeepers in the town.    During our abode at Porto Cabello, the current on the coast, generally  directed towards the west,* ran from west to east. This upward current  (corriente por arriba), is very frequent during two or three months of  the year, from September to November. It is believed to be owing to  some north-west winds that have blown between Jamaica and Cape St.  Antony in the island of Cuba. (* The wrecks of the Spanish ships,  burnt at the island of Trinidad, at the time of its occupation by the  English in 1797, were carried by the general or rotary current to  Punta Brava, near Porto Cabello. This general current toward the east,  from the coasts of Paria to the isthmus of Panama and the western  extremity of the island of Cuba, was the subject of a violent dispute  between Don Diego Columbus, Oviedo, and the pilot Andres, in the  sixteenth century.)    The military defence of the coasts of Terra Firma rests on six points:  the castle of San Antonio at Cumana; the Morro of Nueva Barcelona; the  fortifications of La Guayra, (mounting one hundred and thirty-four  guns); Porto Cabello; fort San Carlos, (at the mouth of the lake of  Maracaybo); and Carthagena. Porto Cabello is, next to Carthagena, the  most important fortified place. The town of Porto Cabello is quite  modern, and the port is one of the finest in the world. Art has had  scarcely anything to add to the advantages which the nature of the  spot presents. A neck of land stretches first towards the north, and  then towards the west. Its western extremity is opposite to a range of  islands connected by bridges, and so close together that they might be  taken for another neck of land. These islands are all composed of a  calcareous breccia of extremely recent formation, and analagous to  that on the coast of Cumana, and near the castle of Araya. It is a  conglomerate, containing fragments of madrepores and other corals  cemented by a limestone basis and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7025"],[0,"Rob Roy — Complete (#11)"],[1,"of the magistrates before  whom he was brought for examination, and now makes part of a small  collection of arms belonging to the Author. It is a Spanish-barrelled  gun, marked with the letters R. M. C., for Robert MacGregor Campbell.    He was as good as his word, and shot MacLaren when between the stilts of  his plough, wounding him mortally.    The aid of a Highland leech was procured, who probed the wound with a  probe made out of a castock; _i.e._, the stalk of a colewort or cabbage.  This learned gentleman declared he would not venture to prescribe, not  knowing with what shot the patient had been wounded. MacLaren died, and  about the same time his cattle were houghed, and his live stock destroyed  in a barbarous manner.    Robin Oig, after this feat--which one of his biographers represents as  the unhappy discharge of a gun--retired to his mother's house, to boast  that he had drawn the first blood in the quarrel aforesaid. On the  approach of troops, and a body of the Stewarts, who were bound to take up  the cause of their tenant, Robin Oig absconded, and escaped all search.    The doctor already mentioned, by name Callam MacInleister, with James and  Ronald, brothers to the actual perpetrator of the murder, were brought to  trial. But as they contrived to represent the action as a rash deed  committed by \"the daft callant Rob,\" to which they were not accessory,  the jury found their accession to the crime was Not Proven. The alleged  acts of spoil and violence on the MacLarens' cattle, were also found to  be unsupported by evidence. As it was proved, however, that the two  brothers, Ronald and James, were held and reputed thieves, they were  appointed to find caution to the extent of L200, for their good behaviour  for seven years.*    * Note D. Author's expedition against the MacLarens.    The spirit of clanship was at that time, so strong--to which must be  added the wish to secure the adherence of stout, able-bodied, and, as the  Scotch phrase then went, _pretty_ men--that the representative of the  noble family of Perth condescended to act openly as patron of the  MacGregors, and appeared as such upon their trial. So at least the author  was informed by the late Robert MacIntosh, Esq., advocate. The  circumstance may, however, have occurred later than 1736--the year in  which this first trial took place.    Robin Oig served for a time in the 42d regiment, and was present at the  battle of Fontenoy, where he was made prisoner and wounded. He was  exchanged, returned to Scotland, and obtained his discharge. He  afterwards appeared openly in the MacGregor's country; and,  notwithstanding his outlawry, married a daughter of Graham of Drunkie, a  gentleman of some property. His wife died a few years afterwards.    The insurrection of 1745 soon afterwards called the MacGregors to arms.  Robert MacGregor of Glencarnoch, generally regarded as the chief of the  whole name, and grandfather of Sir John, whom the clan received in that  character, raised a MacGregor regiment, with which he joined the standard  of the Chevalier. The race of Ciar Mhor, however, affecting independence,  and commanded by Glengyle and his cousin James Roy MacGregor, did not  join this kindred corps, but united themselves to the levies of the  titular Duke of Perth, until William MacGregor Drummond of Bolhaldie,  whom they regarded as head of their branch, of Clan Alpine, should come  over from France. To cement the union after the Highland fashion, James  laid down the name of Campbell, and assumed that of Drummond, in  compliment to Lord Perth. He was also called James Roy, after his father,  and James Mhor, or Big James, from his height. His corps, the relics of  his father Rob's band, behaved with great activity; with only twelve men  he succeeded in surprising and burning, for the second time, the fort at  Inversnaid, constructed for the express purpose of bridling the country  of the MacGregors.    What rank or command James MacGregor had, is uncertain. He calls himself  Major; and Chevalier Johnstone calls him Captain. He must have held rank  under Ghlune Dhu, his kinsman, but his active and audacious character  placed him above the rest of his brethren. Many of his followers were  unarmed; he supplied the want of guns and swords with scythe-blades set  straight upon their handles.    At the battle of Prestonpans, James Roy distinguished himself. \"His  company,\" says Chevalier Johnstone, \"did great execution with their  scythes.\" They cut the legs of the horses in two--the riders through the  middle of their bodies. MacGregor was brave and intrepid, but at the same  time, somewhat whimsical and singular. When advancing to the charge with  his company, he received five wounds, two of them from balls that pierced  his body through and through. Stretched on the ground, with his head  resting on his hand, he called out loudly to the Highlanders of his  company, \"My lads, I am not dead. By G--, I shall see if any of you does  not do his duty.\" The victory, as is well known, was instantly obtained.    In some curious letters of James Roy,* it appears that his thigh-bone was  broken on this occasion, and that he, nevertheless, rejoined the army  with six companies, and was present at the battle of Culloden.    * Published in Blackwood's Magazine, vol. ii. p. 228.    After that defeat, the clan MacGregor kept together in a body, and did  not disperse till they had returned into their own country. They brought  James Roy with them in a litter; and, without being particularly  molested, he was permitted to reside in the MacGregor's country along  with his brothers.    James MacGregor Drummond was attainted for high treason with persons of  more importance. But it appears he had entered into some communication  with Government, as, in the letters quoted, he mentions having obtained a  pass from the Lord Justice-Clerk in 1747, which was a sufficient  protection to him from the military. The circumstance is obscurely stated  in one of the letters already quoted, but may perhaps, joined to  subsequent incidents, authorise the suspicion that James, like his  father, could look at both sides of the cards. As the confusion of the  country subsided, the MacGregors, like foxes which had baffled the  hounds, drew back to their old haunts, and lived unmolested. But an  atrocious outrage, in which the sons of Rob Roy were concerned, brought  at length on the family the full vengeance of the law.    James Roy was a married man, and had fourteen children. But his brother,  Robin Oig, was now a widower; and it was resolved, if possible, that he  should make his fortune by carrying off and marrying, by force if  necessary, some woman of fortune from the Lowlands.    The imagination of the half-civilised Highlanders was less shocked at the  idea of this particular species of violence, than might be expected from  their general kindness to the weaker sex when they make part of their own  families. But all their views were tinged with the idea that they lived  in a state of war; and in such a state, from the time of the siege of  Troy to \"the moment when Previsa fell,\"* the female captives are, to  uncivilised victors, the most valuable part of the booty--    * Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto II.              \"The wealthy are slaughtered, the lovely are spared.\"    We need not refer to the rape of the Sabines, or to a similar instance in  the Book of Judges, for evidence that such deeds of violence have been  committed upon a large scale. Indeed, this sort of enterprise was so  common along the Highland line as to give rise to a variety of songs and  ballads.*    * See Appendix, No. VI.    The annals of Ireland, as well as those of Scotland, prove the crime to  have been common in the more lawless parts of both countries; and any  woman who happened to please a man of spirit who came of a good house,  and possessed a few chosen friends, and a retreat in the mountains, was  not permitted the alternative of saying him nay. What is more, it would  seem that the women themselves, most interested in the immunities of  their sex, were, among the lower classes, accustomed to regard such  marriages as that which is presently to be detailed as \"pretty Fanny's  way,\" or rather, the way of Donald with pretty Fanny. It is not a great  many years since a respectable woman, above the lower rank of life,  expressed herself very warmly to the author on his taking the freedom to  censure the behaviour of the MacGregors on the occasion in question. She  said \"that there was no use in giving a bride too much choice upon such  occasions; that the marriages were the happiest long syne which had been  done offhand.\" Finally, she averred that her \"own mother had never seen  her father till the night he brought her up from the Lennox, with ten  head of black cattle, and there had not been a happier couple in the  country.\"    James Drummond and his brethren having similar opinions with the author's  old acquaintance, and debating how they might raise the fallen fortunes  of their clan, formed a resolution to settle their brother's fortune by  striking up an advantageous marriage betwixt Robin Oig and one Jean Key,  or Wright, a young woman scarce twenty years old, and who had been left  about two months a widow by the death of her husband. Her property was  estimated at only from 16,000 to 18,000 merks, but it seems to have been  sufficient temptation to these men to join in the commission of a great  crime.    This poor young victim lived with her mother in her own house at  Edinbilly, in the parish of Balfron and shire of Stirling. At this place,  in the night of 3d December 1750, the sons of Rob Roy, and particularly  James Mhor and Robin Oig, rushed into the house where the object of their  attack was resident, presented guns, swords, and pistols to the males of  the family, and terrified the women by threatening to break open the  doors if Jean Key was not"]]]
