Each  exoccipital also forms the posterior part of the otic notch, which  traverses the exoccipital. The exoccipitals bear moderate occipital  crests that extend posterolaterally across the supraoccipital as  branches from the supratemporal crest. The supraoccipital also has a  medial crest that extends a short distance posteriorly from the  supratemporal crest onto the exoccipitals at their dorsal line of  fusion.       [Illustration: FIG. 7.

Teeth shown by means        of broken lines were represented only by their sockets.]    _Maxillo-palatal-pterygoid arch._--In an articulated skull, the  anterior edge of the maxillary is immediately posterior to the lateral  tip of the premaxillary (fig. 7). The maxillary is curved moderately  laterally and is not robust at its tip, but it becomes heavier about  one-third of its length posteriorly. A dorsomedian process begins at  about one-third of its distance from the anterior end; the prefrontal  articulates with this process. The process is broad and almost flat,  except that at its medial end, an elongate, rounded knob extends  ventrally. The dorsomedian process of the maxillary extends toward,  but does not meet, a lateral process from the palatine. The maxillary  teeth are set in sockets on the ventral surface of the bone. Just  posterior to the level of the last prediastemal tooth is the median  trans-palatine process that articulates with the anteromedian part of  the trans-palatine. Immediately posterior to this process, the  maxillary narrows slightly; then it broadens to form an obliquely  oriented knob. The posteroventral surface of the posterior knob of the  maxillary bears one or two enlarged maxillary teeth. (These teeth are  discussed further in the section on Dentition.) The anterolateral part  of the trans-palatine articulates with the dorsal surface of the  posterior knob of the maxillary. Toward the middle of its length, the  trans-palatine narrows considerably; then it broadens again and  articulates with the pterygoid. The palatine is slightly rounded at  its anterior end, which extends anteriorly to the posterior margin of  the vacuity containing Jacobson's organ. The palatine extends  posteriorly to the trans-palatine process of the maxilla, where the  palatine articulates with the pterygoid. A posterior pterygoid process  from the palatine projects posteromedially from the end of the  palatine and overlaps the anterior end of the pterygoid. Just less  than one-half the distance from the anterior end of the palatine,  there is a lateral process that curves ventrolaterally forming a blunt  tip posteriorly. Slightly more posteriorly and on the medial side of  the palatine, is a medial sphenoid process, which is thin, rather  broad, and curves ventromedially; ultimately it comes to lie near the  anterior part of the parasphenoid. The palatine teeth are set in  shallow sockets on the ventral edge of the bone. Of the bones of the  maxillo-palatal-pterygoid arch, those on the pterygoid extend farthest  posteriorly. The pterygoid is broad medially and posteriorly, although  pointed at its posterior tip. The trans-palatine articulates in a  broad line at about one-third of the distance along the lateral margin  of the pterygoid. Immediately posterior to this articulation, there is  a median ridge on the pterygoid; lateral to the pterygoid ridge is an  abrupt hollow, the pterygoid groove. Posteromedially, this groove  becomes gradually more shallow and disappears. The dorsal surface of  the pterygoid is rounded anteriorly and somewhat flattened  posteriorly, whereas the ventral surface is gently rounded along its  length, except that there is a high median crest. The pterygoid teeth  are situated in shallow sockets along this crest. The teeth diminish  in size posteriorly.       [Illustration: FIG. 8. The left mandible and associated        quadrate of _Conophis lineatus concolor_ (UMMZ S-788) showing        (A) lateral and (B) medial views. x 3. Teeth shown by means of        broken lines were represented only by their sockets.]    _Mandible._--The dentary (fig. 8) is compressed laterally and rounded  below. The teeth, which are longest about one-third of the way from  the anterior end of the dentary, are set in sockets on the medial side  of the bone. The posterior half of the dentary overlies the fused  surangular-prearticular part of the articular. Ventrally, the  posterior part of the dentary underlies the splenial, which is set in  a median trench within the dentary. Near the common suture of the  dentary and the splenial is the large inferior alveolar foramen;  completely within the splenial and ventral to the inferior alveolar  foramen is the anterior mylohyoid foramen. Posterior to the splenial  and also forming a part of the ventral surface of the mandible is the  wedge-shaped angular, which lies directly beneath the fused  surangular-prearticular. As has been implied, the articular, the  surangular, and the prearticular are fused. The prearticular part of  this bone forms a part of Meckel's canal. In the surangular part,  immediately posterior to the end of the dentary, is the large  surangular foramen. Lying in a longitudinal axis along the medial  surface of the articular is a high crest, dorsal to which is a deep  hollow. The lateral wall of the articular above this hollow is thin  and rounded dorsally; the ventral surface is uniformly round and  slightly curved dorsally, except that it ends with a short tympanic  crest, which projects beyond the articulation with the quadrate. Where  the quadrate articulates with the dorsolateral surface of the  posterior portion of the squamosal, the former is broad and has a high  mid-lateral crest, which extends about one-third of the distance down  the quadrate before disappearing. The columellar process (the place of  fusion of the columella) is about two-thirds of the way down the  medial surface of the quadrate. Ventrally the quadrate has a narrow  neck dorsal to its articulation with the articular. The articulation  is formed by two lateral flanges of the quadrate that fit over a  medial ridge formed by the articular.      Dentition    Teeth on the maxillary and pterygoid decrease in size posteriorly,  whereas those of the dentary do likewise except for the first one or  two that are usually slightly smaller than those immediately  posterior. The palatine teeth are subequal in size. The enlarged,  grooved teeth on the maxillary are in shallow sockets on the  posteroventral surface of the posterior knob of the maxillary. These  teeth point posteriorly. The grooves are deep and are situated  anterolaterally. One or two enlarged grooved teeth are present on a  given maxillary. There seems to be a correlation between the type of  preservation, the age of the snake, and the number of grooved teeth.  Old (large) individuals always have only one grooved tooth that is  rooted and functional, whereas some of the younger animals have two in  place. Usually replacement teeth are present in alcoholic specimens,  but these unrooted teeth are lost in the preparation of dried  skeletons. Thus, it seems that in _Conophis_ only one pair of grooved  teeth is functional at any one time, although usually replacement  teeth are present behind and beside the functional one. Some specimens  have one tooth in the medial socket on one side and one in the lateral  socket on the other. Replacement teeth on the maxillary and dentary  are present in the buccal tissue on the medial side of the bones,  whereas on the palatines and pterygoids, the replacement teeth are  present laterally. Apparently there are no significant differences in  dentition among the members of the genus _Conophis_.      Vertebrae    The fiftieth vertebra of _Conophis vittatus_ (UMMZ 82642) can be  described as follows: The neural spine is elongate, thin and low; the  posterior edge is sharply emarginate, and the anterior edge is only  slightly emarginate. The zygosphene is thin dorsoventrally; in a  ventral or dorsal view the zygosphene has a slightly concave anterior  edge, the flat surface of which is oriented ventrolaterally. The  centrum is elongate and triangular from below; it is widest at the  paradiapophyses and narrowest at the short condylar neck. The condylus  is directed posteriorly. The centrum, when viewed laterally, is  slightly concave and has prominent subcentral ridges that extend from  the median side of the paradiapophysial articular surfaces posteriorly  to the neck of the condylus. The paradiapophysial articular surfaces  are well developed and have two facets. The diapophysial surface is  larger and more spherical than the parapophysial one. The  parapophysial process projects beyond the parapophysial articular  surface and is nearly even with the lip of the cotyle, which is  slightly oval. The neural arch is slightly depressed; its width is  somewhat less than the width of the cotyle. The articular surfaces of  the postzygapophyses are oval and are directed posterolaterally. There  is a strongly developed concave interzygapophysial ridge. A  well-developed accessory spine extends laterally beyond the oval  articular facets of the pre-zygapophysis and forms a slightly  flattened, blunt spine. Excellent drawings of the middle thoracic  vertebra of _Conophis lineatus dunni_ from Honduras were published by  Auffenberg (1958:6).      Hemipenes    The hemipenes of _Conophis_ are moderately caliculate, having spines  covering the surface from the base to near the apex (fig. 9). These  spines are largest near the base and are reduced to small papillate  projections near the apex. The apex terminates in a small disc having  three to five laminae in _C. vittatus_ and one lamina in _C. lineatus  concolor_.

To solve it we will not rely upon the accidents which good fortune may  now and again procure for us. We must employ the breeding-cage, which  will permit of assiduous visits, continued inquiry and a variety of  artifices. But how populate the cage? The land of the olive-tree is not  rich in Necrophori. To my knowledge it possesses only a single species,  N. vestigator (Hersch.); and even this rival of the grave-diggers of  the north is pretty scarce. The discovery of three or four in the  course of the spring was as much as my searches yielded in the old  days. This time, if I do not resort to the ruses of the trapper, I  shall obtain them in no greater numbers; whereas I stand in need of at  least a dozen.    These ruses are very simple. To go in search of the layer-out of  bodies, who exists only here and there in the country-side, would be  almost always waste of time; the favourable month, April, would elapse  before my cage was suitably populated. To run after him is to trust too  much to accident; so we will make him come to us by scattering in the  orchard an abundant collection of dead Moles. To this carrion, ripened  by the sun, the insect will not fail to hasten from the various points  of the horizon, so accomplished is he in the detection of such a  delicacy.    I make an arrangement with a gardener in the neighbourhood, who, two or  three times a week, supplements the penury of my acre and a half of  stony ground, providing me with vegetables raised in a better soil. I  explain to him my urgent need of Moles, an indefinite number of moles.  Battling daily with trap and spade against the importunate excavator  who uproots his crops, he is in a better position than any one else to  procure for me that which I regard for the moment as more precious than  his bunches of asparagus or his white-heart cabbages.    The worthy man at first laughs at my request, being greatly surprised  by the importance which I attribute to the abhorrent creature, the  Darboun; but at last he consents, not without a suspicion at the back  of his mind that I am going to make myself a wonderful flannel-lined  waist-coat with the soft, velvety skins of the Moles, something good  for pains in the back. Very well. We settle the matter. The essential  thing is that the Darbouns shall reach me.    They reach me punctually, by twos, by threes, by fours, packed in a few  cabbage-leaves, at the bottom of the gardener's basket. The worthy man  who lent himself with such good grace to my strange requirements will  never guess how much comparative psychology will owe him! In a few days  I was the possessor of thirty Moles, which were scattered here and  there, as they reached me, in bare portions of the orchard, amid the  rosemary-bushes, the arbutus-trees, and the lavender-beds.    Now it only remained to wait and to examine, several times a day, the  under-side of my little corpses, a disgusting task which any one would  avoid who had not the sacred fire in his veins. Only little Paul, of  all the household, lent me the aid of his nimble hand to seize the  fugitives. I have already stated that the entomologist has need of  simplicity of mind. In this important business of the Necrophori, my  assistants were a child and an illiterate.    Little Paul's visits alternating with mine, we had not long to wait.  The four winds of heaven bore forth in all directions the odour of the  carrion; and the undertakers hurried up, so that the experiments, begun  with four subjects, were continued with fourteen, a number not attained  during the whole of my previous searches, which were unpremeditated and  in which no bait was used as decoy. My trapper's ruse was completely  successful.    Before I report the results obtained in the cage, let us for a moment  stop to consider the normal conditions of the labours that fall to the  lot of the Necrophori. The Beetle does not select his head of game,  choosing one in proportion to his strength, as do the predatory Wasps;  he accepts it as hazard presents it to him. Among his finds there are  little creatures, such as the Shrew-mouse; animals of medium size, such  as the Field-mouse; and enormous beasts, such as the Mole, the  Sewer-rat and the Snake, any of which exceeds the powers of excavation  of a single grave-digger. In the majority of cases transportation is  impossible, so disproportioned is the burden to the motive-power. A  slight displacement, caused by the effort of the insects' backs, is all  that can possibly be effected.    Ammophilus and Cerceris, Sphex and Pompilus excavate their burrows  wherever they please; they carry their prey thither on the wing, or, if  too heavy, drag it afoot. The Necrophorus knows no such facilities in  his task. Incapable of carrying the monstrous corpse, no matter where  encountered, he is forced to dig the grave where the body lies.    This obligatory place of sepulture may be in stony soil; it may occupy  this or that bare spot, or some other where the grass, especially the  couch-grass, plunges into the ground its inextricable network of little  cords. There is a great probability, too, that a bristle of stunted  brambles may support the body at some inches from the soil. Slung by  the labourers' spade, which has just broken his back, the Mole falls  here, there, anywhere, at random; and where the body falls, no matter  what the obstacles--provided they be not insurmountable--there the  undertaker must utilize it.    The difficulties of inhumation are capable of such variety as causes us  already to foresee that the Necrophorus cannot employ fixed methods in  the accomplishment of his labours. Exposed to fortuitous hazards, he  must be able to modify his tactics within the limits of his modest  perceptions. To saw, to break, to disentangle, to lift, to shake, to  displace: these are so many methods of procedure which are  indispensable to the grave-digger in a predicament. Deprived of these  resources, reduced to uniformity of method, the insect would be  incapable of pursuing the calling which has fallen to its lot.    We see at once how imprudent it would be to draw conclusions from an  isolated case in which rational coordination or premeditated intention  might appear to intervene. Every instinctive action no doubt has its  motive; but does the animal in the first place judge whether the action  is opportune? Let us begin by a careful consideration of the creature's  labours; let us support each piece of evidence by others; and then we  shall be able to answer the question.    First of all, a word as to diet. A general scavenger, the  Burying-beetle refuses nothing in the way of cadaveric putridity. All  is good to his senses, feathered game or furry, provided that the  burden do not exceed his strength. He exploits the batrachian or the  reptile with no less animation, he accepts without hesitation  extraordinary finds, probably unknown to his race, as witness a certain  Gold-fish, a red Chinese Carp, whose body, placed in one of my cages,  was instantly considered an excellent tit-bit and buried according to  the rules. Nor is butcher's meat despised. A mutton-cutlet, a strip of  beefsteak, in the right stage of maturity, disappeared beneath the  soil, receiving the same attention as those which were lavished on the  Mole or the Mouse. In short, the Necrophorus has no exclusive  preferences; anything putrid he conveys underground.    The maintenance of his industry, therefore, presents no sort of  difficulty. If one kind of game be lacking, some other--the first to  hand--will very well replace it. Neither is there much trouble in  establishing the site of his industry. A capacious dish-cover of wire  gauze is sufficient, resting on an earthen pan filled to the brim with  fresh, heaped sand. To obviate criminal attempts on the part of the  Cats, whom the game would not fail to tempt, the cage is installed in a  closed room with glazed windows, which in winter is the refuge of the  plants and in summer an entomological laboratory.    Now to work. The Mole lies in the centre of the enclosure. The soil,  easily shifted and homogeneous, realizes the best conditions for  comfortable work. Four Necrophori, three males and a female, are there  with the body. They remain invisible, hidden beneath the carcass, which  from time to time seems to return to life, shaken from end to end by  the backs of the workers. An observer not in the secret would be  somewhat astonished to see the dead creature move. From time to time,  one of the sextons, almost always a male, emerges and goes the rounds  of the animal, which he explores, probing its velvet coat. He hurriedly  returns, appears again, once more investigates and creeps back under  the corpse.    The tremors become more pronounced; the carcass oscillates, while a  cushion of sand, pushed outward from below, grows up all about it. The  Mole, by reason of his own weight and the efforts of the grave-diggers,  who are labouring at their task beneath him, gradually sinks, for lack  of support, into the undermined soil.    Presently the sand which has been pushed outward quivers under the  thrust of the invisible miners, slips into the pit and covers the  interred Mole. It is a clandestine burial. The body seems to disappear  of itself, as though engulfed by a fluid medium. For a long time yet,  until the depth is regarded as sufficient, the body will continue to  descend.    It is, when all is taken into account, a very simple operation. As the  diggers, underneath the corpse, deepen the cavity into which it sinks,  tugged and shaken by the sextons, the grave, without their  intervention, fills of itself by the mere downfall of the shaken soil.  Useful shovels at the tips of their claws, powerful backs, capable of  creating a little earthquake: the diggers need nothing more for the  practice of their profession. Let us add--for this is an essential  point--the art of continually jerking and"]]]
