The difference between a hired and a free trapper was greatly in favor  of the latter. The hired trapper was regularly indentured, and bound not  only to hunt and trap for his employers, but also to perform any duty  required of him in camp. The Booshway, or the trader, or the partisan,  (leader of the detachment,) had him under his command, to make him take  charge of, load and unload the horses, stand guard, cook, hunt fuel, or,  in short, do any and every duty. In return for this toilsome service he  received an outfit of traps, arms and ammunition, horses, and whatever  his service required. Besides his outfit, he received no more than three  or four hundred dollars a year as wages.    There was also a class of free trappers, who were furnished with their  outfit by the company they trapped for, and who were obliged to agree to  a certain stipulated price for their furs before the hunt commenced.  But the genuine free trapper regarded himself as greatly the superior of  either of the foregoing classes. He had his own horses and  accoutrements, arms and ammunition. He took what route he thought fit,  hunted and trapped when and where he chose; traded with the Indians;  sold his furs to whoever offered highest for them; dressed flauntingly,  and generally had an Indian wife and half-breed children. They prided  themselves on their hardihood and courage; even on their recklessness  and profligacy. Each claimed to own the best horse; to have had the  wildest adventures; to have made the most narrow escapes; to have killed  the greatest number of bears and Indians; to be the greatest favorite  with the Indian belles, the greatest consumer of alcohol, and to have  the most money to spend, _i. e._ the largest credit on the books of the  company. If his hearers did not believe him, he was ready to run a race  with him, to beat him at \"old sledge,\" or to fight, if fighting was  preferred,--ready to prove what he affirmed in any manner the company  pleased.    If the free trapper had a wife, she moved with the camp to which he  attached himself, being furnished with a fine horse, caparisoned in the  gayest and costliest manner. Her dress was of the finest goods the  market afforded, and was suitably ornamented with beads, ribbons,  fringes, and feathers. Her rank, too, as a free trapper's wife, gave her  consequence not only in her own eyes, but in those of her tribe, and  protected her from that slavish drudgery to which as the wife of an  Indian hunter or warrior she would have been subject. The only authority  which the free trapper acknowledged was that of his Indian spouse, who  generally ruled in the lodge, however her lord blustered outside.    One of the free trapper's special delights was to take in hand the raw  recruits, to gorge their wonder with his boastful tales, and to amuse  himself with shocking his pupil's civilized notions of propriety. Joe  Meek did not escape this sort of \"breaking in;\" and if it should appear  in the course of this narrative that he proved an apt scholar, it will  but illustrate a truth--that high spirits and fine talents tempt the  tempter to win them over to his ranks. But Joe was not won over all at  once. He beheld the beautiful spectacle of the encampment as it has been  described, giving life and enchantment to the summer landscape, changed  into a scene of the wildest carousal, going from bad to worse, until  from harmless noise and bluster it came to fighting and loss of life. At  this first rendezvous he was shocked to behold the revolting exhibition  of four trappers playing at a game of cards with the dead body of a  comrade for a card-table! Such was the indifference to all the natural  and ordinary emotions which these veterans of the wilderness cultivated  in themselves, and inculcated in those who came under their influence.  Scenes like this at first had the effect to bring feelings of  home-sickness, while it inspired by contrast a sort of penitential and  religious feeling also. According to Meek's account of those early days  in the mountains, he said some secret prayers, and shed some secret  tears. But this did not last long. The force of example, and especially  the force of ridicule, is very potent with the young; nor are we quite  free from their influence later in life.    If the gambling, swearing, drinking, and fighting at first astonished  and alarmed the unsophisticated Joe, he found at the same time something  to admire, and that he felt to be congenial with his own disposition, in  the fearlessness, the contempt of sordid gain, the hearty merriment and  frolicsome abandon of the better portion of the men about him. A spirit  of emulation arose in him to become as brave as the bravest, as hardy as  the hardiest, and as gay as the gayest, even while his feelings still  revolted at many things which his heroic models were openly guilty of.  If at any time in the future course of this narrative, Joe is discovered  to have taken leave of his early scruples, the reader will considerately  remember the associations by which he was surrounded for years, until  the memory of the pious teachings of his childhood was nearly, if not  quite, obliterated. To \"nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in  malice,\" should be the frame of mind in which both the writer and reader  of Joe's adventures should strive to maintain himself.    Before our hero is ushered upon the active scenes of a trapper's life,  it may be well to present to the reader a sort of _guide to camp life_,  in order that he may be able to understand some of its technicalities,  as they may be casually mentioned hereafter.    When the large camp is on the march, it has a leader, generally one of  the Booshways, who rides in advance, or at the head of the column.  Near him is a led mule, chosen for its qualities of speed and  trustworthiness, on which are packed two small trunks that balance each  other like panniers, and which contain the company's books, papers, and  articles of agreement with the men. Then follow the pack animals, each  one bearing three packs--one on each side, and one on top--so nicely  adjusted as not to slip in traveling. These are in charge of certain men  called camp-keepers, who have each three of these to look after. The  trappers and hunters have two horses, or mules, one to ride, and one to  pack their traps. If there are women and children in the train, all are  mounted. Where the country is safe, the caravan moves in single file,  often stretching out for half or three-quarters of a mile. At the end  of the column rides the second man, or \"little Booshway,\" as the men  call him; usually a hired officer, whose business it is to look after  the order and condition of the whole camp.    [Illustration: MULE PACKING.]    On arriving at a suitable spot to make the night camp, the leader stops,  dismounts in the particular space which is to be devoted to himself in  its midst. The others, as they come up, form a circle; the \"second man\"  bringing up the rear, to be sure all are there. He then proceeds to  appoint every man a place in the circle, and to examine the horses'  backs to see if any are sore. The horses are then turned out, under a  guard, to graze; but before darkness comes on are placed inside the  ring, and picketed by a stake driven in the earth, or with two feet so  tied together as to prevent easy or free locomotion. The men are divided  into messes: so many trappers and so many camp-keepers to a mess. The  business of eating is not a very elaborate one, where the sole article  of diet is meat, either dried or roasted. By a certain hour all is quiet  in camp, and only the guard is awake. At times during the night, the  leader, or the officer of the guard, gives the guard a challenge--\"all's  well!\" which is answered by \"all's well!\"    In the morning at daylight, or sometimes not till sunrise, according to  the safe or dangerous locality, the second man comes forth from his  lodge and cries in French, \"_leve, leve, leve, leve, leve!_\" fifteen or  twenty times, which is the command to rise. In about five minutes more  he cries out again, in French, \"_leche lego, leche lego!_\" or turn out,  turn out; at which command all come out from the lodges, and the horses  are turned loose to feed; but not before a horseman has galloped all  round the camp at some distance, and discovered every thing to be safe  in the neighborhood. Again, when the horses have been sufficiently fed,  under the eye of a guard, they are driven up, the packs replaced, the  train mounted, and once more it moves off, in the order before  mentioned.    In a settled camp, as in winter, there are other regulations. The leader  and the second man occupy the same relative positions; but other minor  regulations are observed. The duty of a trapper, for instance, in the  trapping season, is only to trap, and take care of his own horses. When  he comes in at night, he takes his beaver to the clerk, and the number  is counted off, and placed to his credit. Not he, but the camp-keepers,  take off the skins and dry them. In the winter camp there are six  persons to a lodge: four trappers and two camp-keepers; therefore the  trappers are well waited upon, their only duty being to hunt, in turns,  for the camp. When a piece of game is brought in,--a deer, an antelope,  or buffalo meat,--it is thrown down on the heap which accumulates in  front of the Booshway's lodge; and the second man stands by and cuts it  up, or has it cut up for him. The first man who chances to come along,  is ordered to stand still and turn his back to the pile of game, while  the \"little Booshway\" lays hold of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39471"],[0,"Zoological Illustrations, Volume 1 (#11)"],[1,"continent: their bills are much stronger, thicker, and more rounded than  the genuine Kingsfishers, and the under mandible beneath invariably  carinated and curving upwards. One of them (the _Alcedo Senegalensis_ of  Latham) is known to feed on crabs, the breaking and disjointing of which  this structure seems admirably calculated to accomplish; and although some  authors mention insects also as their food, I apprehend it is only in the  absence of other larger prey more suited to the construction of their  bills.    Total length eight inches and a half. Bill two inches three lines from the  gape, and one inch three quarters from the nostrils; upper mandible and  margin and lip of the lower, black, the rest yellowish-white. The general  plumage above is pale and changeable greenish-blue, the green predominating  on the scapulars, head and tail; the upper part of the neck is crossed by a  white collar, separated from the green of the head by a narrow margin of  black, which passes on the ear-feathers round the nape; a narrow whitish  line runs from the nostrils to the eyebrows, and another very short one is  beneath the eye; the whole of the under plumage white. Quills black edged  with blue, the second, third and fourth equal and longest. Wings four  inches and a quarter. Tail even, near three inches long, above blue-green,  beneath black. Feet dusky; middle and outer claws much longer than the leg.    Inhabits Java and other parts of India, and is I believe unfigured. The  line at the bottom of the plate is on the scale of an inch.    Since writing the above, Temminck's new edition of the _Manuel  d'Ornithologie_ has just reached me, in which I perceive he has continued  the birds of this genus under that of _Alcedo_, observing that their  plumage is always shining, and that he can find no characters for their  geographic distribution: yet, notwithstanding the opinion of this eminent  ornithologist, a close attention will I believe prove, first, that no  species of Linnaean _Alcedo_ bearing the characters of _Halcyon_ have yet  been discovered as natives of America; and secondly, that species of  genuine _Alcedo_ will be found with plumage quite devoid of any bright or  shining colours. One or two exist in my own cabinet, but to which I cannot  now refer.    The situation of _Halcyon_ will be between _Alcedo_ and _Dacelo_; from the  last of which it is distinguished by its perfectly straight, acute, and  entire upper mandible, which, on the contrary, in _Dacelo_ is notched, the  tip bent and obtuse.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 28    [Illustration]    HESPERIA Haworthiana.    _Haworth's Hesperia._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Antennae mediocres vel elongatae, rectae, graciles; clava      subterminali, brevi, crassata, cylindracea; unco abrupto, brevi,      acuminato.

Having for a  long time paid attention to this family, and possessing near 300 species in  my own cabinet, I have had the opportunity of attempting their elucidation;  and the above generic character is applied to those insects only which I  propose considering genuine species of the genus _Hesperia_, and which will  comprise near 170 species.
