To bring the end back to the sloop was a smaller matter  still, and I believe I chuckled above my sorrows when I found that in  all the haphazard my judgment or my good genius had faithfully stood  by me. The cable reached from the anchor in deep water to the sloop's  windlass by just enough to secure a turn and no more. The anchor had  been dropped at the right distance from the vessel. To heave all taut  now and wait for the coming tide was all I could do.    I had already done enough work to tire a stouter man, and was only too  glad to throw myself on the sand above the tide and rest; for the sun  was already up, and pouring a generous warmth over the land. While my  state could have been worse, I was on the wild coast of a foreign  country, and not entirely secure in my property, as I soon found out.  I had not been long on the shore when I heard the patter, patter of a  horse's feet approaching along the hard beach, which ceased as it came  abreast of the sand-ridge where I lay sheltered from the wind. Looking  up cautiously, I saw mounted on a nag probably the most astonished boy  on the whole coast. He had found a sloop! \"It must be mine,\" he  thought, \"for am I not the first to see it on the beach?\" Sure enough,  there it was all high and dry and painted white. He trotted his horse  around it, and finding no owner, hitched the nag to the sloop's  bobstay and hauled as though he would take her home; but of course she  was too heavy for one horse to move. With my skiff, however, it was  different; this he hauled some distance, and concealed behind a dune  in a bunch of tall grass. He had made up his mind, I dare say, to  bring more horses and drag his bigger prize away, anyhow, and was  starting off for the settlement a mile or so away for the  reinforcement when I discovered myself to him, at which he seemed  displeased and disappointed. \"Buenos dias, muchacho,\" I said. He  grunted a reply, and eyed me keenly from head to foot. Then bursting  into a volley of questions,--more than six Yankees could ask,--he  wanted to know, first, where my ship was from, and how many days she  had been coming. Then he asked what I was doing here ashore so early  in the morning. \"Your questions are easily answered,\" I replied; \"my  ship is from the moon, it has taken her a month to come, and she is  here for a cargo of boys.\" But the intimation of this enterprise, had  I not been on the alert, might have cost me dearly; for while I spoke  this child of the campo coiled his lariat ready to throw, and instead  of being himself carried to the moon, he was apparently thinking of  towing me home by the neck, astern of his wild cayuse, over the fields  of Uruguay.    The exact spot where I was stranded was at the Castillo Chicos, about  seven miles south of the dividing-line of Uruguay and Brazil, and of  course the natives there speak Spanish. To reconcile my early visitor,  I told him that I had on my ship biscuits, and that I wished to trade  them for butter and milk. On hearing this a broad grin lighted up his  face, and showed that he was greatly interested, and that even in  Uruguay a ship's biscuit will cheer the heart of a boy and make him  your bosom friend. The lad almost flew home, and returned quickly with  butter, milk, and eggs. I was, after all, in a land of plenty. With  the boy came others, old and young, from neighboring ranches, among  them a German settler, who was of great assistance to me in many ways.    [Illustration: A double surprise.]    A coast-guard from Fort Teresa, a few miles away, also came, \"to  protect your property from the natives of the plains,\" he said. I took  occasion to tell him, however, that if he would look after the people  of his own village, I would take care of those from the plains,  pointing, as I spoke, to the nondescript \"merchant\" who had already  stolen my revolver and several small articles from my cabin, which by  a bold front I had recovered. The chap was not a native Uruguayan.  Here, as in many other places that I visited, the natives themselves  were not the ones discreditable to the country.    Early in the day a despatch came from the port captain of Montevideo,  commanding the coastguards to render the _Spray_ every assistance.  This, however, was not necessary, for a guard was already on the  alert, and making all the ado that would become the wreck of a steamer  with a thousand emigrants aboard. The same messenger brought word from  the port captain that he would despatch a steam-tug to tow the _Spray_  to Montevideo. The officer was as good as his word; a powerful tug  arrived on the following day; but, to make a long story short, with  the help of the German and one soldier and one Italian, called \"Angel  of Milan,\" I had already floated the sloop and was sailing for port  with the boom off before a fair wind. The adventure cost the _Spray_  no small amount of pounding on the hard sand; she lost her shoe and  part of her false keel, and received other damage, which, however, was  readily mended afterward in dock.    On the following day I anchored at Maldonado. The British consul, his  daughter, and another young lady came on board, bringing with them a  basket of fresh eggs, strawberries, bottles of milk, and a great loaf  of sweet bread. This was a good landfall, and better cheer than I had  found at Maldonado once upon a time when I entered the port with a  stricken crew in my bark, the _Aquidneck_.    In the waters of Maldonado Bay a variety of fishes abound, and  fur-seals in their season haul out on the island abreast the bay to  breed. Currents on this coast are greatly affected by the prevailing  winds, and a tidal wave higher than that ordinarily produced by the  moon is sent up the whole shore of Uruguay before a southwest gale, or  lowered by a northeaster, as may happen. One of these waves having  just receded before the northeast wind which brought the _Spray_ in  left the tide now at low ebb, with oyster-rocks laid bare for some  distance along the shore. Other shellfish of good flavor were also  plentiful, though small in size. I gathered a mess of oysters and  mussels here, while a native with hook and line, and with mussels for  bait, fished from a point of detached rocks for bream, landing several  good-sized ones.    The fisherman's nephew, a lad about seven years old, deserves mention  as the tallest blasphemer, for a short boy, that I met on the voyage.  He called his old uncle all the vile names under the sun for not  helping him across the gully. While he swore roundly in all the moods  and tenses of the Spanish language, his uncle fished on, now and then  congratulating his hopeful nephew on his accomplishment. At the end of  his rich vocabulary the urchin sauntered off into the fields, and  shortly returned with a bunch of flowers, and with all smiles handed  them to me with the innocence of an angel. I remembered having seen  the same flower on the banks of the river farther up, some years  before. I asked the young pirate why he had brought them to me. Said  he, \"I don't know; I only wished to do so.\" Whatever the influence was  that put so amiable a wish in this wild pampa boy, it must be  far-reaching, thought I, and potent, seas over.    Shortly after, the _Spray_ sailed for Montevideo, where she arrived on  the following day and was greeted by steam-whistles till I felt  embarrassed and wished that I had arrived unobserved. The voyage so  far alone may have seemed to the Uruguayans a feat worthy of some  recognition; but there was so much of it yet ahead, and of such an  arduous nature, that any demonstration at this point seemed, somehow,  like boasting prematurely.    The _Spray_ had barely come to anchor at Montevideo when the agents of  the Royal Mail Steamship Company, Messrs. Humphreys & Co., sent word  that they would dock and repair her free of expense and give me twenty  pounds sterling, which, they did to the letter, and more besides. The  calkers at Montevideo paid very careful attention to the work of  making the sloop tight. Carpenters mended the keel and also the  life-boat (the dory), painting it till I hardly knew it from a  butterfly.    Christmas of 1895 found the _Spray_ refitted even to a wonderful  makeshift stove which was contrived from a large iron drum of some  sort punched full of holes to give it a draft; the pipe reached  straight up through the top of the forecastle. Now, this was not a  stove by mere courtesy. It was always hungry, even for green wood; and  in cold, wet days off the coast of Tierra del Fuego it stood me in  good stead. Its one door swung on copper hinges, which one of the yard  apprentices, with laudable pride, polished till the whole thing  blushed like the brass binnacle of a P. & O. steamer.    The _Spray_ was now ready for sea. Instead of proceeding at once on  her voyage, however, she made an excursion up the river, sailing  December 29. An old friend of mine, Captain Howard of Cape Cod and of  River Plate fame, took the trip in her to Buenos Aires, where she  arrived early on the following day, with a gale of wind and a current  so much in her favor that she outdid herself. I was glad to have a  sailor of Howard's experience on board to witness her performance of  sailing with no living being at the helm. Howard sat near the binnacle  and watched the compass while the sloop held her course so steadily  that one would have declared that the card was nailed fast. Not a  quarter of a point did she deviate from her course. My old friend had  owned and sailed a pilot-sloop on the river for many years, but this  feat took the wind out of his sails at last, and he cried, \"I'll be  stranded on Chico Bank if ever I saw the like of it!\" Perhaps he had  never given his sloop a chance to show what she could do. The point I  make for the _Spray_ here, above all other points, is that she sailed  in shoal water "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6322"],[0,"Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America, During the (#11)"],[1,"  of long continuance: and, like that which flows along the isles of  Ferro and Gomera, it deposits every year on the western coasts of  Ireland and Norway the fruit of trees which belong to the torrid  zone of America. On the shores of the Hebrides, we collect seeds of  Mimosa scandens, of Dolichos urens, of Guilandina bonduc, and  several other plants of Jamaica, the isle of Cuba, and of the  neighbouring continent. The current carries thither also barrels of  French wine, well preserved, the remains of the cargoes of vessels  wrecked in the West Indian seas. To these examples of the distant  migration of the vegetable world, others no less striking may be  added. The wreck of an English vessel, the Tilbury, burnt near  Jamaica, was found on the coast of Scotland. On these same coasts  are sometimes found various kinds of tortoises, that inhabit the  waters of the Antilles. When the western winds are of long  duration, a current is formed in the high latitudes, which runs  directly towards east-south-east, from the coasts of Greenland and  Labrador, as far as the north of Scotland. Wallace relates, that  twice (in 1682 and 1684), American savages of the race of the  Esquimaux, driven out to sea in their leathern canoes, during a  storm, and left to the guidance of the currents, reached the  Orkneys. This last example is the more worthy of attention, as it  proves at the same time how, at a period when the art of navigation  was yet in its infancy, the motion of the waters of the ocean may  have contributed to disseminate the different races of men over the  face of the globe.    In reflecting on the causes of the Atlantic currents, we find that  they are much more numerous than is generally believed; for the  waters of the sea may be put in motion by an external impulse, by  difference of heat and saltness, by the periodical melting of the  polar ice, or by the inequality of evaporation, in different  latitudes. Sometimes several of these causes concur to one and the  same effect, and sometimes they produce several contrary effects.  Winds that are light, but which, like the trade-winds, are  continually acting on the whole of a zone, cause a real movement of  transition, which we do not observe in the heaviest tempests,  because these last are circumscribed within a small space. When, in  a great mass of water, the particles at the surface acquire a  different specific gravity, a superficial current is formed, which  takes its direction towards the point where the water is coldest,  or where it is most saturated with muriate of soda, sulphate of  lime, and muriate or sulphate of magnesia. In the seas of the  tropics we find, that at great depths the thermometer marks 7 or 8  centesimal degrees. Such is the result of the numerous experiments  of commodore Ellis and of M. Peron. The temperature of the air in  those latitudes being never below 19 or 20 degrees, it is not at  the surface that the waters can have acquired a degree of cold so  near the point of congelation, and of the maximum of the density of  water. The existence of this cold stratum in the low latitudes is  an evident proof of the existence of an under-current, which runs  from the poles towards the equator: it also proves that the saline  substances which alter the specific gravity of the water, are  distributed in the ocean, so as not to annihilate the effect  produced by the differences of temperature.    Considering the velocity of the molecules, which, on account of the  rotatory motion of the globe, vary with the parallels, we may be  tempted to admit that every current, in the direction from south to  north, tends at the same time eastward, while the waters which run  from the pole towards the equator, have a tendency to deviate  westward. We may also be led to think that these tendencies  diminish to a certain point the speed of the tropical current, in  the same manner as they change the direction of the polar current,  which in July and August, is regularly perceived during the melting  of the ice, on the parallel of the bank of Newfoundland, and  farther north. Very old nautical observations, which I have had  occasion to confirm by comparing the longitude given by the  chronometer with that which the pilots obtained by their reckoning,  are, however, contrary to these theoretical ideas. In both  hemispheres, the polar currents, when they are perceived, decline a  little to the east; and it would seem that the cause of this  phenomenon should be sought in the constancy of the westerly winds  which prevail in the high latitudes. Besides, the particles of  water do not move with the same rapidity as the particles of air;  and the currents of the ocean, which we consider as most rapid,  have only a swiftness of eight or nine feet a second; it is  consequently very probable, that the water, in passing through  different parallels, gradually acquires a velocity correspondent to  those parallels, and that the rotation of the earth does not change  the direction of the currents.    The variable pressure on the surface of the sea, caused by the  changes in the weight of the air, is another cause of motion which  deserves particular attention. It is well known, that the  barometric variations do not in general take place at the same  moment in two distant points, which are on the same level. If in  one of these points the barometer stands a few lines lower than in  the other, the water will rise where it finds the least pressure of  air, and this local intumescence will continue, till, from the  effect of the wind, the equilibrium of the air is restored. M.  Vaucher thinks that the tides in the lake of Geneva, known by the  name of the seiches, arise from the same cause. We know not whether  it be the same, when the movement of progression, which must not be  confounded with the oscillation of the waves, is the effect of an  external impulse. M. de Fleurieu, in his narrative of the voyage of  the Isis, cites several facts, which render it probable that the  sea is not so still at the bottom as naturalists generally suppose.  Without entering here into a discussion of this question, we shall  only observe that, if the external impulse is constant in its  action, like that of the trade-winds, the friction of the particles  of water on each other must necessarily propagate the motion of the  surface of the ocean even to the lower strata; and in fact this  propagation in the Gulf-stream has long been admitted by  navigators, who think they discover the effects in the great depth  of the sea wherever it is traversed by the current of Florida, even  amidst the sand-banks which surround the northern coasts of the  United States. This immense river of hot waters, after a course of  fifty days, from the 24th to the 45th degree of latitude, or 450  leagues, does not lose, amidst the rigours of winter in the  temperate zone, more than 3 or 4 degrees of the temperature it had  under the tropics. The greatness of the mass, and the small  conductibility of water for heat, prevent a more speedy  refrigeration. If, therefore, the Gulf-stream has dug a channel at  the bottom of the Atlantic ocean, and if its waters are in motion  to considerable depths, they must also in their inferior strata  keep up a lower temperature than that observed in the same  parallel, in a part of the sea which has neither currents nor deep  shoals. These questions can be cleared up only by direct  experiments, made by thermometrical soundings.    Sir Erasmus Gower remarks, that, in the passage from England to the  Canary islands, the current, which carries vessels towards the  south-east, begins at the 39th degree of latitude. During our  voyage from Corunna to the coast of South America, the effect of  this motion of the waters was perceived farther north. From the  37th to the 30th degree, the deviation was very unequal; the daily  average effect was 12 miles, that is, our sloop drove towards the  east 75 miles in six days. In crossing the parallel of the straits  of Gibraltar, at a distance of 140 leagues, we had occasion to  observe, that in those latitudes the maximum of the rapidity does  not correspond with the mouth of the straits, but with a more  northerly point, which lies on the prolongation of a line passing  through the strait and Cape St. Vincent. This line is parallel to  the direction which the waters follow from the Azores to Cape  Cantin. We should moreover observe (and this fact is not  uninteresting to those who examine the nature of fluids), that in  this part of the retrograde current, on a breadth of 120 or 140  leagues, the whole mass of water has not the same rapidity, nor  does it follow precisely the same direction. When the sea is  perfectly calm, there appears at the surface narrow stripes, like  small rivulets, in which the waters run with a murmur very sensible  to the ear of an experienced pilot. On the 13th of June, in 34  degrees 36 minutes north latitude, we found ourselves in the midst  of a great number of these beds of currents. We took their  direction with the compass, and some ran north-east, others  east-north-east, though the general movement of the ocean,  indicated by comparing the reckoning with the chronometrical  longitude, continued to be south-east. It is very common to see a  mass of motionless waters crossed by threads of water, which run in  different directions, and we may daily observe this phenomenon on  the surface of lakes; but it is much less frequent to find partial  movements, impressed by local causes on small portions of waters in  the midst of an oceanic river, which occupies an immense space, and  which moves, though slowly, in a constant direction. In the  conflict of currents, as in the oscillation of the waves, our  imagination is struck by those movements which seem to penetrate  each other, and by which the ocean is continually agitated.    We passed Cape St. Vincent, which is of basaltic formation, at the"]]]
