Master says to me this  morning, \"Look out,\" 'e says, \"Saunders, for them boys as come in 'ere  after eggs, and frighten all the birds out of the dratted place. You  keep your eyes open, Saunders,\" 'e says.'    'Well, if 'e's still in the woods, we'll 'ave 'im safe.'    '_If_ he's still in the woods!' thought Barrett with a shiver.    After this there was silence. Barrett waited for what he thought was a  quarter of an hour--it was really five minutes or less--then he peeped  cautiously over the edge of his hiding-place. Yes, they had certainly  gone, unless--horrible thought--they were waiting so close to the trunk  of the tree as to be invisible from where he stood. He decided that the  possibility must be risked. He was down on the ground in record time.  Nothing happened. No hand shot out from its ambush to clutch him. He  breathed more freely, and began to debate within himself which way to  go. Up the hill it must be, of course, but should he go straight up, or  to the left or to the right? He would have given much to know which way  the keepers had gone, particularly he of the dog. They had separated,  he knew. He began to reason the thing out. In the first place if they  had separated, they must have gone different ways. It did not take him  long to arrive at that conclusion. The odds, therefore, were that one  had gone to the right up-stream, the other down-stream to the left. His  knowledge of human nature told him that nobody would willingly walk  up-hill if it was possible for him to walk on the flat. Therefore,  assuming the two keepers to be human, they had gone along the valley.  Therefore, his best plan would be to make straight for the top of the  hill, as straight as he could steer, and risk it. Just as he was about  to start, his eye caught the two pill-boxes, lying on the turf a few  yards from where he had placed them.    'May as well take what I can get,' he thought. He placed them carefully  in his pocket. As he did so a faint bark came to him on the breeze from  down-stream. That must be friend Jack. He waited no longer, but dived  into the bushes in the direction of the summit. He was congratulating  himself on being out of danger--already he was more than half way up  the hill--when suddenly he received a terrible shock. From the bushes  to his left, not ten yards from where he stood, came the clear, sharp  sound of a whistle. The sound was repeated, and this time an answer  came from far out to his right. Before he could move another whistle  joined in, again from the left, but farther off and higher up the hill  than the first he had heard. He recalled what Grey had said about  'millions' of keepers. The expression, he thought, had understated the  true facts, if anything. He remembered the case of Babington. It was a  moment for action. No guile could save him now. It must be a stern  chase for the rest of the distance. He drew a breath, and was off like  an arrow. The noise he made was appalling. No one in the wood could  help hearing it.    'Stop, there!' shouted someone. The voice came from behind, a fact  which he noted almost automatically and rejoiced at. He had a start at  any rate.    'Stop!' shouted the voice once again. The whistle blew like a steam  siren, and once more the other two answered it. They were all behind  him now. Surely a man of the public schools in flannels and gymnasium  shoes, and trained to the last ounce for just such a sprint as this,  could beat a handful of keepers in their leggings and heavy boots.  Barrett raced on. Close behind him a crashing in the undergrowth and  the sound of heavy breathing told him that keeper number one was doing  his best. To left and right similar sounds were to be heard. But  Barrett had placed these competitors out of the running at once. The  race was between him and the man behind.    Fifty yards of difficult country, bushes which caught his clothes as if  they were trying to stop him in the interests of law and order,  branches which lashed him across the face, and rabbit-holes half hidden  in the bracken, and still he kept his lead. He was increasing it. He  must win now. The man behind was panting in deep gasps, for the pace  had been warm and he was not in training. Barrett cast a glance over  his shoulder, and as he looked the keeper's foot caught in a hole and  he fell heavily. Barrett uttered a shout of triumph. Victory was his.    In front of him was a small hollow fringed with bushes. Collecting his  strength he cleared these with a bound. Then another of the events of  this eventful afternoon happened. Instead of the hard turf, his foot  struck something soft, something which sat up suddenly with a yell.  Barrett rolled down the slope and halfway up the other side like a shot  rabbit. Dimly he recognized that he had jumped on to a human being. The  figure did not wear the official velveteens. Therefore he had no  business in the Dingle. And close behind thundered the keeper, now on  his feet once more, dust on his clothes and wrath in his heart in equal  proportions. 'Look out, man!' shouted Barrett, as the injured person  rose to his feet. 'Run! Cut, quick! Keeper!' There was no time to say  more. He ran. Another second and he was at the top, over the railing,  and in the good, honest, public high-road again, safe. A hoarse shout  of 'Got yer!' from below told a harrowing tale of capture. The stranger  had fallen into the hands of the enemy. Very cautiously Barrett left  the road and crept to the railing again. It was a rash thing to do, but  curiosity overcame him. He had to see, or, if that was impossible, to  hear what had happened.    For a moment the only sound to be heard was the gasping of the keeper.  After a few seconds a rapidly nearing series of crashes announced the  arrival of the man from the right flank of the pursuing forces, while  almost simultaneously his colleague on the left came up.    Barrett could see nothing, but it was easy to understand what was going  on. Keeper number one was exhibiting his prisoner. His narrative,  punctuated with gasps, was told mostly in hoarse whispers, and Barrett  missed most of it.    'Foot (gasp) rabbit-'ole.' More gasps. 'Up agen ... minute ...  (indistinct mutterings) ... and (triumphantly) COTCHED IM!'    Exclamations of approval from the other two. 'I assure you,' said  another voice. The prisoner was having his say. 'I assure you that I  was doing no harm whatever in this wood. I....'    'Better tell that tale to Sir Alfred,' cut in one of his captors.    ''E'll learn yer,' said the keeper previously referred to as number  one, vindictively. He was feeling shaken up with his run and his heavy  fall, and his temper was proportionately short.    'I swear I've heard that voice before somewhere,' thought Barrett.  'Wonder if it's a Coll. chap.'    Keeper number one added something here, which was inaudible to Barrett.    'I tell you I'm not a poacher,' said the prisoner, indignantly. 'And I  object to your language. I tell you I was lying here doing nothing and  some fool or other came and jumped on me. I....'    The rest was inaudible. But Barrett had heard enough.    'I knew I'd heard that voice before. Plunkett, by Jove! Golly, what is  the world coming to, when heads of Houses and School-prefects go on the  poach! Fancy! Plunkett of all people, too! This is a knock-out, I'm  hanged if it isn't.'    From below came the sound of movement. The keepers were going down the  hill again. To Barrett's guilty conscience it seemed that they were  coming up. He turned and fled.    The hedge separating Sir Alfred Venner's land from the road was not a  high one, though the drop the other side was considerable. Barrett had  not reckoned on this. He leapt the hedge, and staggered across the  road. At the same moment a grey-clad cyclist, who was pedalling in a  leisurely manner in the direction of the School, arrived at the spot. A  collision seemed imminent, but the stranger in a perfectly composed  manner, as if he had suddenly made up his mind to take a sharp turning,  rode his machine up the bank, whence he fell with easy grace to the  road, just in time to act as a cushion for Barrett. The two lay there  in a tangled heap. Barrett was the first to rise.          [9]    ENTER THE SLEUTH-HOUND      'I'm awfully sorry,' he said, disentangling himself carefully from the  heap. 'I hope you're not hurt.'    The man did not reply for a moment. He appeared to be laying the  question before himself as an impartial judge, as who should say: 'Now  tell me candidly, _are_ you hurt? Speak freely and without bias.'    'No,' he said at last, feeling his left leg as if he were not  absolutely easy in his mind about that, 'no, not hurt, thank you. Not  much, that is,' he added with the air of one who thinks it best to  qualify too positive a statement. 'Left leg. Shin. Slight bruise.  Nothing to signify.'    'It was a rotten thing to do, jumping over into the road like that,'  said Barrett. 'Didn't remember there'd be such a big drop.'    'My fault in a way,' said the man. 'Riding wrong side of road. Out for  a run?'    'More or less.'    'Excellent thing.'    'Yes.'    It occurred to Barrett that it was only due to the man on whom he had  been rolling to tell him the true facts of the case. Besides, it might  do something towards removing the impression which must, he felt, be  forming in the stranger's mind that he was mad.    'You see,' he said, in a burst of confidence, 'it was rather a close  thing. There were some keepers after me.'    'Ah!' said the man. 'Thought so. Trespassing?'    'Yes.'    'Ah. Keepers don't like trespassers. Curious thing--don't know if it  ever occurred to you--if there were no trespassers, there would be no  need for keepers. To their interest, then, to encourage trespassers.  But do they?'    Barrett admitted that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6985"],[0,"A Prefect's Uncle (#11)"],[1,"  fifty-nine in the course of a single over. Gethryn's calculations, if  he had only known, could have done now with a little revision.    Gosling was the next man. He was followed, after a brief innings of  three balls, which realized eight runs, by Baynes. Baynes, though  abstaining from runs himself, helped Pringle to add three to the score,  all in singles, and was then yorked by the slow man, who meanly and  treacherously sent down, without the slightest warning, a very fast one  on the leg stump. Then Reece came in for the last wicket, and the rot  stopped. Reece always went in last for the School, and the School in  consequence always felt that there were possibilities to the very end  of the innings.    The lot of a last-wicket man is somewhat trying. As at any moment his  best innings may be nipped in the bud by the other man getting out, he  generally feels that it is hardly worth while to play himself in before  endeavouring to make runs. He therefore tries to score off every ball,  and thinks himself lucky if he gets half a dozen. Reece, however, took  life more seriously. He had made quite an art of last-wicket batting.  Once, against the Butterflies, he had run up sixty not out, and there  was always the chance that he would do the same again. Today, with  Pringle at the other end, he looked forward to a pleasant hour or two  at the wicket.    No bowler ever looks on the last man quite in the same light as he does  the other ten. He underrates him instinctively. The M.C.C. fast bowler  was a man with an idea. His idea was that he could bowl a slow ball of  diabolical ingenuity. As a rule, public feeling was against his trying  the experiment. His captains were in the habit of enquiring rudely if  he thought he was playing marbles. This was exactly what the M.C.C.  captain asked on the present occasion, when the head ball sailed  ponderously through the air, and was promptly hit by Reece into the  Pavilion. The bowler grinned, and resumed his ordinary pace.    But everything came alike to Reece. Pringle, too, continued his career  of triumph. Gradually the score rose from a hundred and seventy to two  hundred. Pringle cut and drove in all directions, with the air of a  prince of the blood royal distributing largesse. The second century  went up to the accompaniment of cheers.    Then the slow bowler reaped his reward, for Pringle, after putting his  first two balls over the screen, was caught on the boundary off the  third. He had contributed eighty-one to a total of two hundred and  thirteen.    So far Gethryn's absence had not been noticed. But when the umpires had  gone out, and the School were getting ready to take the field,  inquiries were made.    'You might begin at the top end, Gosling,' said Norris.    'Right,' said Samuel. 'Who's going on at the other?'    'Baynes. Hullo, where's Gethryn?'    'Isn't he here? Perhaps he's in the Pavi--'    'Any of you chaps seen Gethryn?'    'He isn't in the Pav.,' said Baker. 'I've just come out of the First  room myself, and he wasn't there. Shouldn't wonder if he's over at  Leicester's.'    'Dash the man,' said Norris, 'he might have known we'd be going out to  field soon. Anyhow, we can't wait for him. We shall have to field a  sub. till he turns up.'    'Lorimer's in the Pav., changed,' said Pringle.    'All right. He'll do.'    And, reinforced by the gratified Lorimer, the team went on its way.    In the beginning the fortunes of the School prospered. Gosling opened,  as was his custom, at a tremendous pace, and seemed to trouble the  first few batsmen considerably. A worried-looking little person who had  fielded with immense zeal during the School innings at cover-point took  the first ball. It was very fast, and hit him just under the knee-cap.  The pain, in spite of the pad, appeared to be acute. The little man  danced vigorously for some time, and then, with much diffidence,  prepared himself for the second instalment.    Now, when on the cricket field, the truculent Samuel was totally  deficient in all the finer feelings, such as pity and charity. He could  see that the batsman was in pain, and yet his second ball was faster  than the first. It came in quickly from the off. The little batsman  went forward in a hesitating, half-hearted manner, and played a clear  two inches inside the ball. The off-stump shot out of the ground.    'Bowled, Sammy,' said Norris from his place in the slips.    The next man was a clergyman, a large man who suggested possibilities  in the way of hitting. But Gosling was irresistible. For three balls  the priest survived. But the last of the over, a fast yorker on the leg  stump, was too much for him, and he retired.    Two for none. The critic in the deck chair felt that the match was as  good as over.    But this idyllic state of things was not to last. The newcomer, a tall  man with a light moustache, which he felt carefully after every ball,  soon settled down. He proved to be a conversationalist. Until he had  opened his account, which he did with a strong drive to the ropes, he  was silent. When, however, he had seen the ball safely to the boundary,  he turned to Reece and began.    'Rather a nice one, that. Eh, what? Yes. Got it just on the right  place, you know. Not a bad bat this, is it? What? Yes. One of Slogbury  and Whangham's Sussex Spankers, don't you know. Chose it myself. Had it  in pickle all the winter. Yes.'    'Play, sir,' from the umpire.    'Eh, what? Oh, right. Yes, good make these Sussex--_Spankers_. Oh,  well fielded.'    At the word spankers he had effected another drive, but Marriott at  mid-off had stopped it prettily.    Soon it began to occur to Norris that it would be advisable to have a  change of bowling. Gosling was getting tired, and Baynes apparently  offered no difficulties to the batsman on the perfect wicket, the  conversational man in particular being very severe upon him. It was at  such a crisis that the Bishop should have come in. He was Gosling's  understudy. But where was he? The innings had been in progress over  half an hour now, and still there were no signs of him. A man, thought  Norris, who could cut off during the M.C.C. match (of all matches!),  probably on some rotten business of his own, was beyond the pale, and  must, on reappearance, be fallen upon and rent. He--here something  small and red whizzed at his face. He put up his hands to protect  himself. The ball struck them and bounded out again. When a fast bowler  is bowling a slip he should not indulge in absent-mindedness. The  conversational man had received his first life, and, as he was careful  to explain to Reece, it was a curious thing, but whenever he was let  off early in his innings he always made fifty, and as a rule a century.  Gosling's analysis was spoilt, and the match in all probability lost.  And Norris put it all down to Gethryn. If he had been there, this would  not have happened.    'Sorry, Gosling,' he said.    'All right,' said Gosling, though thinking quite the reverse. And he  walked back to bowl his next ball, conjuring up a beautiful vision in  his mind. J. Douglas and Braund were fielding slip to him in the  vision, while in the background Norris appeared, in a cauldron of  boiling oil.    'Tut, tut,' said Baker facetiously to the raging captain.    Baker's was essentially a flippant mind. Not even a moment of solemn  agony, such as this, was sacred to him.    Norris was icy and severe.    'If you want to rot about, Baker,' he said, 'perhaps you'd better go  and play stump-cricket with the juniors.'    'Well,' retorted Baker, with great politeness, 'I suppose seeing you  miss a gaper like that right into your hands made me think I was  playing stump-cricket with the juniors.'    At this point the conversation ceased, Baker suddenly remembering that  he had not yet received his First Eleven colours, and that it would  therefore be rash to goad the captain too freely, while Norris, for his  part, recalled the fact that Baker had promised to do some Latin verse  for him that evening, and might, if crushed with some scathing  repartee, refuse to go through with that contract. So there was silence  in the slips.    The partnership was broken at last by a lucky accident. The  conversationalist called his partner for a short run, and when that  unfortunate gentleman had sprinted some twenty yards, reconsidered the  matter and sent him back. Reece had the bails off before the victim had  completed a third of the return journey.    For some time after this matters began to favour the School again. With  the score at a hundred and five, three men left in two overs, one  bowled by Gosling, the others caught at point and in the deep off  Jennings, who had deposed Baynes. Six wickets were now down, and the  enemy still over a hundred behind.    But the M.C.C. in its school matches has this peculiarity. However  badly it may seem to stand, there is always something up its sleeve. In  this case it was a professional, a man indecently devoid of anything in  the shape of nerves. He played the bowling with a stolid confidence,  amounting almost to contempt, which struck a chill to the hearts of the  School bowlers. It did worse. It induced them to bowl with the sole  object of getting the conversationalist at the batting end, thus  enabling the professional to pile up an unassuming but rapidly  increasing score by means of threes and singles.    As for the conversationalist, he had made thirty or more, and wanted  all the bowling he could get.    'It's a very curious thing,' he said to Reece, as he faced Gosling,  after his partner had scored a three off the first ball of the over,  'but some fellows simply detest fast bowling. Now I--' He never finished  the sentence. When he spoke again it was to begin a new one.    'How on earth did that happen?' he asked.    'I think it bowled you,' said Reece stolidly, picking up the two stumps  which had been uprooted by Gosling's express.    'Yes. But how?"]]]
