Tarascus  wheeled, but even before he could recognize his attacker, Conan's  poniard ripped into him.    But the blow was not mortal, as Conan knew the instant he struck. His  foot had caught in a fold of the curtains and tripped him as he leaped.  The point fleshed itself in Tarascus' shoulder and plowed down along his  ribs, and the king of Nemedia screamed.    The impact of the blow and Conan's lunging body hurled him back against  the table and it toppled and the candle went out. They were both carried  to the floor by the violence of Conan's rush, and the foot of the  tapestry hampered them both in its folds. Conan was stabbing blindly in  the dark, Tarascus screaming in a frenzy of panicky terror. As if fear  lent him superhuman energy, Tarascus tore free and blundered away in the  darkness, shrieking: 'Help! Guards! Arideus! Orastes! Orastes!'    Conan rose, kicking himself free of the tangling tapestries and the  broken table, cursing with the bitterness of his blood-thirsty  disappointment. He was confused, and ignorant of the plan of the palace.  The yells of Tarascus were still resounding in the distance, and a wild  outcry was bursting forth in answer. The Nemedian had escaped him in the  darkness, and Conan did not know which way he had gone. The Cimmerian's  rash stroke for vengeance had failed, and there remained only the task  of saving his own hide if he could.    Swearing luridly, Conan ran back down the passage and into the alcove,  glaring out into the lighted corridor, just as Zenobia came running up  it, her dark eyes dilated with terror.    'Oh, what has happened?' she cried. 'The palace is roused! I swear I  have not betrayed you--'    'No, it was I who stirred up this hornet's nest,' he grunted. 'I tried  to pay off a score. What's the shortest way out of this?'    She caught his wrist and ran fleetly down the corridor. But before they  reached the heavy door at the other end, muffled shouts arose from  behind it and the portals began to shake under an assault from the other  side. Zenobia wrung her hands and whimpered.    'We are cut off! I locked that door as I returned through it. But they  will burst it in a moment. The way to the postern gate lies through it.'    Conan wheeled. Up the corridor, though still out of sight, he heard a  rising clamor that told him his foes were behind as well as before him.    'Quick! Into this door!' the girl cried desperately, running across the  corridor and throwing open the door of a chamber.    Conan followed her through, and then threw the gold catch behind them.  They stood in an ornately furnished chamber, empty but for themselves,  and she drew him to a gold-barred window, through which he saw trees and  shrubbery.    'You are strong,' she panted. 'If you can tear these bars away, you may  yet escape. The garden is full of guards, but the shrubs are thick, and  you may avoid them. The southern wall is also the outer wall of the  city. Once over that, you have a chance to get away. A horse is hidden  for you in a thicket beside the road that runs westward, a few hundred  paces to the south of the fountain of Thrallos. You know where it is?'    'Aye! But what of you? I had meant to take you with me.'    A flood of joy lighted her beautiful face.    'Then my cup of happiness is brimming! But I will not hamper your  escape. Burdened with me you would fail. Nay, do not fear for me. They  will never suspect that I aided you willingly. Go! What you have just  said will glorify my life throughout the long years.'    He caught her up in his iron arms, crushed her slim, vibrant figure to  him and kissed her fiercely on eyes, cheeks, throat and lips, until she  lay panting in his embrace; gusty and tempestuous as a storm-wind, even  his love-making was violent.    'I'll go,' he muttered. 'But by Crom, I'll come for you some day!'    Wheeling, he gripped the gold bars and tore them from their sockets with  one tremendous wrench; threw a leg over the sill and went down swiftly,  clinging to the ornaments on the wall. He hit the ground running and  melted like a shadow into the maze of towering rose-bushes and spreading  trees. The one look he cast back over his shoulder showed him Zenobia  leaning over the window-sill, her arms stretched after him in mute  farewell and renunciation.    Guards were running through the garden, all converging toward the  palace, where the clamor momentarily grew louder--tall men in burnished  cuirasses and crested helmets of polished bronze. The starlight struck  glints from their gleaming armor, among the trees, betraying their every  movement; but the sound of their coming ran far before them. To Conan,  wilderness-bred, their rush through the shrubbery was like the  blundering stampede of cattle. Some of them passed within a few feet of  where he lay flat in a thick cluster of bushes, and never guessed his  presence. With the palace as their goal, they were oblivious to all else  about them. When they had gone shouting on, he rose and fled through the  garden with no more noise than a panther would have made.    So quickly he came to the southern wall, and mounted the steps that led  to the parapet. The wall was made to keep people out, not in. No sentry  patrolling the battlements was in sight. Crouching by an embrasure he  glanced back at the great palace rearing above the cypresses behind him.  Lights blazed from every window, and he could see figures flitting back  and forth across them like puppets on invisible strings. He grinned  hardly, shook his fist in a gesture of farewell and menace, and let  himself over the outer rim of the parapet.    A low tree, a few yards below the parapet, received Conan's weight, as  he dropped noiselessly into the branches. An instant later he was racing  through the shadows with the swinging hillman's stride that eats up long  miles.    Gardens and pleasure villas surrounded the walls of Belverus. Drowsy  slaves, sleeping by their watchman's pikes, did not see the swift and  furtive figure that scaled walls, crossed alleys made by the arching  branches of trees, and threaded a noiseless way through orchards and  vineyards. Watchdogs woke and lifted their deep-booming clamor at a  gliding shadow, half scented, half sensed, and then it was gone.           *       *       *       *       *    In a chamber of the palace Tarascus writhed and cursed on a  blood-spattered couch, under the deft, quick fingers of Orastes. The  palace was thronged with wide-eyed, trembling servitors, but the chamber  where the king lay was empty save for himself and the renegade priest.    'Are you sure he still sleeps?' Tarascus demanded again, setting his  teeth against the bite of the herb juices with which Orastes was  bandaging the long, ragged gash in his shoulder and ribs. 'Ishtar, Mitra  and Set! That burns like molten pitch of hell!'    'Which you would be experiencing even now, but for your good fortune,'  remarked Orastes. 'Whoever wielded that knife struck to kill. Yes, I  have told you that Xaltotun still sleeps. Why are you so urgent upon  that point? What has he to do with this?'    'You know nothing of what has passed in the palace tonight?' Tarascus  searched the priest's countenance with burning intensity.    'Nothing. As you know, I have been employed in translating manuscripts  for Xaltotun, for some months now, transcribing esoteric volumes written  in the younger languages into script he can read. He was well versed in  all the tongues and scripts of his day, but he has not yet learned all  the newer languages, and to save time he has me translate these works  for him, to learn if any new knowledge has been discovered since his  time. I did not know that he had returned last night until he sent for  me and told me of the battle. Then I returned to my studies, nor did I  know that you had returned until the clamor in the palace brought me out  of my cell.'    'Then you do not know that Xaltotun brought the king of Aquilonia a  captive to this palace?'    Orastes shook his head, without particular surprise.    'Xaltotun merely said that Conan would oppose us no more. I supposed  that he had fallen, but did not ask the details.'    'Xaltotun saved his life when I would have slain him,' snarled Tarascus.  'I saw his purpose instantly. He would hold Conan captive to use as a  club against us--against Amalric, against Valerius, and against myself.  So long as Conan lives he is a threat, a unifying factor for Aquilonia,  that might be used to compel us into courses we would not otherwise  follow. I mistrust this undead Pythonian. Of late I have begun to fear  him.    'I followed him, some hours after he had departed eastward. I wished to  learn what he intended doing with Conan. I found that he had imprisoned  him in the pits. I intended to see that the barbarian died, in spite of  Xaltotun. And I accomplished----'    A cautious knock sounded at the door.    'That's Arideus,' grunted Tarascus. 'Let him in.'    The saturnine squire entered, his eyes blazing with suppressed  excitement.    'How, Arideus?' exclaimed Tarascus. 'Have you found the man who attacked  me?'    'You did not see him, my lord?' asked Arideus, as one who would assure  himself of a fact he already knows to exist. 'You did not recognize  him?'    'No. It happened so quick, and the candle was out--all I could think of  was that it was some devil loosed on me by Xaltotun's magic----'    'The Pythonian sleeps in his barred and bolted room. But I have been in  the pits.' Arideus twitched his lean shoulders excitedly.    'Well, speak, man!' exclaimed Tarascus impatiently. 'What did you find  there?'    'An empty dungeon,' whispered the squire. 'The corpse of the great ape!'    '_What?_' Tarascus started upright, and blood gushed from his opened  wound.    'Aye! The man-eater is dead--stabbed through the heart--and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#11)"],[1,"it.    \"There he is! There's my friend who didn't believe I would ever  succeed!\" exclaimed Mr. Fenwick, pointing to a man who stood in the  street in front of a large, white house. \"I'll drop him a message!\"    One was in readiness in a weighted pasteboard cylinder, and soon it  was falling downward. The airship was moving slowly, as it was  beating against the wind.    Leaning out of the cabin window, Mr. Fenwick shouted to his friend:    \"Hey, Will! I thought you said my airship would never go! I'll come  and give you a ride, some day!\"    Whether the gentleman understood what Mr. Fenwick shouted at him is  doubtful, but he saw the inventor waving his hand, and he saw the  falling cylinder, and a look of astonishment spread over his face,  as he ran to pick up the message.    \"We're going up now, and will try to head for home,\" said Tom, a  moment later, as he shifted the rudder.    \"Bless my storage battery!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"But we have had a fine  trip.\"    \"A much better one than we'll have going back,\" observed Tom, in a  low voice.    \"Why; what's the matter?\" asked the eccentric man.    \"The wind has increased to a gale, and will be dead against us,\"  answered Tom.    Mr. Fenwick was busy writing another message to drop, and he paid  little attention to the young inventor. Tom sent the craft well up  into the air, and then tried to turn it about, and head back for  Philadelphia. No sooner had he done so than the airship was met by  the full force of the wind, which was now almost a hurricane. It had  steadily increased, but, as long as they were moving with it, they  did not notice it so much. Once they attempted to stem its fury they  found themselves almost helpless.    Tom quickly realized this, and, giving up his intention of beating  up against the wind, he turned the craft around, and let it fly  before the gale, the propellers aiding to get up a speed of seventy  miles an hour.    Mr. Fenwick, who had dropped the last of his messages, came from his  small private cabin, to where Mr. Damon and Tom were in a low-voiced  conversation near the engines. The owner of the WHIZZER, happened to  look down through a plate-glass window in the floor of car. What he  saw caused him to give a gasp of astonishment.    \"Why--why!\" he exclaimed. \"We--we're over the ocean.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Tom, quietly, as he gazed down on the tumbling  billows below them. They had quickly passed over Cape May, across  the sandy beach, and were now well out over the Atlantic.    \"Why--why are we out here?\" asked Mr. Fenwick. \"Isn't it dangerous--in  an airship that hasn't been thoroughly tried yet?\"    \"Dangerous? Yes, somewhat,\" replied Tom, slowly. \"But we can't help  ourselves, Mr. Fenwick. We can't turn around and go back in this  gale, and we can't descend.\"    \"Then what's to be done?\"    \"Nothing, except to keep on until the gale blows itself out.\"    \"And how long will that be?\"    \"I don't know--a week, maybe.\"    \"Bless my coffee pot, I'm glad we've got plenty on board to eat!\"  exclaimed Mr. Damon.          CHAPTER XI    A NIGHT OF TERROR      After the first shock of Tom's announcement, the two men, who were  traveling with him in the airship, showed no signs of fear. Yet it  was alarming to know that one was speeding over the mighty ocean,  before a terrific gale, with nothing more substantial under one that  a comparatively frail airship.    Still Mr. Damon knew Tom of old, and had confidence in his ability,  and, while Mr. Fenwick was not so well acquainted with our hero, he  had heard much about him, and put faith in his skill to carry them  out of their present difficulty.    \"Are you sure you can't turn around and go back?\" asked Mr. Fenwick.  His knowledge of air-currents was rather limited.    \"It is out of the question,\" replied Tom, simply. \"We would surely  rip this craft to pieces if we attempted to buffet this storm.\"    \"Is it so bad, then?\" asked Mr. Damon, forgetting to bless anything  in the tense excitement of the moment.    \"It might be worse,\" was the reply of the young inventor. \"The wind  is blowing about eighty miles an hour at times, and to try to turn  now would mean that we would tear the planes loose from the ship.  True, we could still keep up by means of the gas bag, but even that  might be injured. Going as we are, in the same direction as that in  which the wind is blowing, we do not feel the full effect of it.\"    \"But, perhaps, if we went lower down, or higher up, we could get in  a different current of air,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick, who had made  some study of aeronautics.    \"I'll try,\" assented Tom, simply. He shifted the elevating rudder,  and the WHIZZER began to go up, slowly, for there was great lateral  pressure on her large surface. But Tom knew his business, and urged  the craft steadily. The powerful electric engines, which were the  invention of Mr. Fenwick, stood them in good stead, and the  barograph soon showed that they were steadily mounting.    \"Is the wind pressure any less?\" inquired Mr. Damon, anxiously.    \"On the contrary, it seems to be increasing,\" replied Tom, with a  glance at the anemometer. \"It's nearly ninety miles an hour now.\"    \"Then, aided by the propellers, we must be making over a hundred  miles an hour.\" said the inventor.    \"We are,--a hundred and thirty,\" assented Tom.    \"We'll be blown across the ocean at this rate,\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my soul! I didn't count on that.\"    \"Perhaps we had better go down,\" suggested Mr. Fenwick. \"I don't  believe we can get above the gale.\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" came from Tom. \"It may be a bit better down  below.\"    Accordingly, the rudder was changed, and the WHIZZER pointed her  nose downward. None of the lifting gas was let out, as it was  desired to save that for emergencies.    Down, down, down, went the great airship, until the adventurers  within, by gazing through the plate glass window in the floor of the  cabin, could see the heaving, white-capped billows, tossing and  tumbling below them.    \"Look out, or we'll be into them!\" shouted Mr. Damon.    \"I guess we may as well go back to the level where we were,\"  declared Tom. \"The wind, both above and below that particular strata  is stronger, and we will be safer up above. Our only chance is to  scud before it, until it has blown itself out. And I hope it will be  soon.\"    \"Why?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a low voice.    \"Because we may be blown so far that we can not get back while our  power holds out, and then--\" Tom did not finish, but Mr. Damon knew  what he meant--death in the tossing ocean, far from land, when the  WHIZZER, unable to float in the air any longer, should drop into the  storm-enraged Atlantic.    They were again on a level, where the gale blew less furiously than  either above or below, but this was not much relief. It seemed as if  the airship would go to pieces, so much was it swayed and tossed  about. But Mr. Fenwick, if he had done nothing else, had made a  staunch craft, which stood the travelers in good stead.    All the rest of that day they swept on, at about the same speed.  There was nothing for them to do, save watch the machinery,  occasionally replenishing the oil tanks, or making minor  adjustments.    \"Well,\" finally remarked Mr. Damon, when the afternoon was waning  away, \"if there's nothing else to do, suppose we eat. Bless my  appetite, but I'm hungry! and I believe you said, Mr. Fenwick, that  you had plenty of food aboard.\"    \"So we have, but the excitement of being blown out to sea on our  first real trip, made me forget all about it. I'll get dinner at  once, if you can put up with an amateur's cooking.\"    \"And I'll help,\" offered Mr. Damon. \"Tom can attend to the airship,  and we'll serve the meals. It will take our minds off our troubles.\"    There was a well equipped kitchen aboard the WHIZZER and soon savory  odors were coming from it. In spite of the terror of their  situation, and it was not to be denied that they were in peril, they  all made a good meal, though it was difficult to drink coffee and  other liquids, owing to the sudden lurches which the airship gave  from time to time as the gale tossed her to and fro.    Night came, and, as the blackness settled down, the gale seemed to  increase in fury. It howled through the slender wire rigging of the  WHIZZER, and sent the craft careening from side to side, and  sometimes thrust her down into a cavern of the air, only to lift her  high again, almost like a ship on the heaving ocean below them.    As darkness settled in blacker and blacker, Tom had a glimpse below  him, of tossing lights on the water.    \"We just passed over some vessel,\" he announced. \"I hope they are in  no worse plight than we are.\" Then, there suddenly came to him a  thought of the parents of Mary Nestor, who were somewhere on the  ocean, in the yacht RESOLUTE bound for the West Indies.    \"I wonder if they're out in this storm, too?\" mused Tom. \"If they  are, unless the vessel is a staunch one, they may be in danger.\"    The thought of the parents of the girl he cared so much for being in  peril, was not reassuring to Tom, and he began to busy himself about  the machinery of the airship, to take his mind from the presentiment  that something might happen to the RESOLUTE.    \"We'll have our own troubles before morning,\" the lad mused, \"if  this wind doesn't die down.\"    There was no indication that this was going to be the case, for the  gale increased rather than diminished. Tom looked at their speed  gage. They were making a good ninety miles an hour, for it had been  decided that it was best to keep the engine and propellers going, as  they steadied the ship.    \"Ninety miles an hour,\" murmured Tom. \"And we've been going at that  rate for ten hours now. That's nearly a thousand miles. We are quite  a distance out to sea.\"    He looked at a compass, and noted that, instead of being headed  directly across the Atlantic they were bearing in a southerly  direction.    \"A"]]]
