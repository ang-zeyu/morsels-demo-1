[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4552"],[0,"The Border Legion (#11)"],[1," revelation and responsibility of serf, as a woman, made this  experience appear to have extended over months.    Kells slowly became convalescent and then he had a relapse. Something  happened, the nature of which Joan could not tell, and he almost died.  There were days when his life hung in the balance, when he could not  talk; and then came a perceptible turn for the better.    The store of provisions grew low, and Joan began to face another serious  situation. Deer and rabbit were plentiful in the canon, but she could  not kill one with a revolver. She thought she would be forced to  sacrifice one of the horses. The fact that Kells suddenly showed a  craving for meat brought this aspect of the situation to a climax. And  that very morning while Joan was pondering the matter she saw a number  of horsemen riding up the canon toward the cabin. At the moment she was  relieved, and experienced nothing of the dread she had formerly felt  while anticipating this very event.    \"Kells,\" she said, quickly, \"there are men riding up the trail.\"    \"Good,\" he exclaimed, weakly, with a light on his drawn face. \"They've  been long in--getting here. How many?\"    Joan counted them--five riders, and several pack-animals.    \"Yes. It's Gulden.\"    \"Gulden!\" cried Joan, with a start.    Her exclamation and tone made Kells regard her attentively.    \"You've heard of him? He's the toughest nut--on this border.... I never  saw his like. You won't be safe. I'm so helpless.... What to say--to  tell him!... Joan, if I should happen to croak--you want to get away  quick... or shoot yourself.\"    How strange to hear this bandit warn her of peril the like of which she  had encountered through him! Joan secured the gun and hid it in a niche  between the logs. Then she looked out again.    The riders were close at hand now. The foremost one, a man of Herculean  build, jumped his mount across the brook, and leaped off while he hauled  the horse to a stop. The second rider came close behind him; the others  approached leisurely, with the gait of the pack-animals.    \"Ho, Kells!\" called the big man. His voice had a loud, bold, sonorous  kind of ring.    \"Reckon he's here somewheres,\" said the other man, presently.    \"Sure. I seen his hoss. Jack ain't goin' to be far from thet hoss.\"    Then both of them approached the cabin. Joan had never before seen two  such striking, vicious-looking, awesome men. The one was huge--so wide  and heavy and deep-set that he looked short--and he resembled a gorilla.  The other was tall, slim, with a face as red as flame, and an expression  of fierce keenness. He was stoop shouldered, yet he held his head erect  in a manner that suggested a wolf scenting blood.    \"Someone here, Pearce,\" boomed the big man.    \"Why, Gul, if it ain't a girl!\"    Joan moved out of the shadow of the wall of the cabin, and she pointed  to the prostrate figure on the blankets.    \"Howdy boys!\" said Kells, wanly.    Gulden cursed in amaze while Pearce dropped to his knee with an  exclamation of concern. Then both began to talk at once. Kells  interrupted them by lifting a weak hand.    \"No, I'm not going--to cash,\" he said. \"I'm only starved--and in need of  stimulants. Had my back half shot off.\"    \"Who plugged you, Jack?\"    \"Gulden, it was your side-partner, Bill.\"    \"Bill?\" Gulden's voice held a queer, coarse constraint. Then he added,  gruffly. \"Thought you and him pulled together.\"    \"Well, we didn't.\"    \"And--where's Bill now?\" This time Joan heard a slow, curious, cold note  in the heavy voice, and she interpreted it as either doubt or deceit.    \"Bill's dead and Halloway, too,\" replied Kells.    Gulden turned his massive, shaggy head in the direction of Joan. She had  not the courage to meet the gaze upon her. The other man spoke:    \"Split over the girl, Jack?\"    \"No,\" replied Kells, sharply. \"They tried to get familiar with--MY  WIFE--and I shot them both.\"    Joan felt a swift leap of hot blood all over her and then a coldness, a  sickening, a hateful weakness.    \"Wife!\" ejaculated Gulden.    \"Your real wife, Jack?\" queried Pearce.    \"Well, I guess, I'll introduce you... Joan, here are two of my  friends--Sam Gulden and Red Pearce.\"    Gulden grunted something.    \"Mrs. Kells, I'm glad to meet you,\" said Pearce.    Just then the other three men entered the cabin and Joan took advantage  of the commotion they made to get out into the air. She felt sick,  frightened, and yet terribly enraged. She staggered a little as she  went out, and she knew she was as pale as death. These visitors thrust  reality upon her with a cruel suddenness. There was something terrible  in the mere presence of this Gulden. She had not yet dared to take a  good look at him. But what she felt was overwhelming. She wanted to  run. Yet escape now was infinitely more of a menace than before. If she  slipped away it would be these new enemies who would pursue her, track  her like hounds. She understood why Kells had introduced her as his  wife. She hated the idea with a shameful and burning hate, but a  moment's reflection taught her that Kells had answered once more to  a good instinct. At the moment he had meant that to protect her.  And further reflection persuaded Joan that she would be wise to act  naturally and to carry out the deception as far as it was possible for  her. It was her only hope. Her position had again grown perilous. She  thought of the gun she had secreted, and it gave her strength to control  her agitation and to return to the cabin outwardly calm.    The men had Kells half turned over with the flesh of his back exposed.    \"Aw, Gul, it's whisky he needs,\" said one.    \"If you let out any more blood he'll croak sure,\" protested another.    \"Look how weak he is,\" said Red Pearce.    \"It's a hell of a lot you know,\" roared Gulden. \"I served my time--but  that's none of your business.... Look here! See that blue spot!\" Gulden  pressed a huge finger down upon the blue welt on Kells's back. The  bandit moaned. \"That's lead--that's the bullet,\" declared Gulden.    \"Wall, if you ain't correct!\" exclaimed Pearce.    Kells turned his head. \"When you punched that place--it made me numb all  over. Gul, if you've located the bullet, cut it out.\"    Joan did not watch the operation. As she went away to the seat under the  balsam she heard a sharp cry and then cheers. Evidently the grim Gulden  had been both swift and successful.    Presently the men came out of the cabin and began to attend to their  horses and the pack-train.    Pearce looked for Joan, and upon seeing her called out, \"Kells wants  you.\"    Joan found the bandit half propped up against a saddle with a damp and  pallid face, but an altogether different look.    \"Joan, that bullet was pressing on my spine,\" he said. \"Now it's out,  all that deadness is gone. I feel alive. I'll get well, soon.... Gulden  was curious over the bullet. It's a forty-four caliber, and neither Bill  Bailey nor Halloway used that caliber of gun. Gulden remembered. He's  cunning. Bill was as near being a friend to this Gulden as any man I  know of. I can't trust any of these men, particularly Gulden. You stay  pretty close by me.\"    \"Kells, you'll let me go soon--help me to get home?\" implored Joan in a  low voice.    \"Girl, it'd never be safe now,\" he replied.    \"Then later--soon--when it is safe?\"    \"We'll see.... But you're my wife now!\"    With the latter words the man subtly changed. Something of the power she  had felt in him before his illness began again to be manifested. Joan  divined that these comrades had caused the difference in him.    \"You won't dare--!\" Joan was unable to conclude her meaning. A tight  band compressed her breast and throat, and she trembled.    \"Will you dare go out there and tell them you're NOT my wife?\" he  queried. His voice had grown stronger and his eyes were blending shadows  of thought.    Joan knew that she dared not. She must choose the lesser of two evils.  \"No man--could be such a beast to a woman--after she'd saved his life,\"  she whispered.    \"I could be anything. You had your chance. I told you to go. I said if I  ever got well I'd be as I was--before.\"    \"But you'd have died.\"    \"That would have been better for you..... Joan, I'll do this. Marry  you honestly and leave the country. I've gold. I'm young. I love you. I  intend to have you. And I'll begin life over again. What do you say?\"    \"Say? I'd die before--I'd marry you!\" she panted.    \"All right, Joan Randle,\" he replied, bitterly. \"For a moment I saw a  ghost. My old dead better self!... It's gone.... And you stay with me.\"          7    After dark Kells had his men build a fire before the open side of the  cabin. He lay propped up on blankets and his saddle, while the others  lounged or sat in a half-circle in the light, facing him.    Joan drew her blankets into a corner where the shadows were thick and  she could see without being seen. She wondered how she would ever sleep  near all these wild men--if she could ever sleep again. Yet she seemed  more curious and wakeful than frightened. She had no way to explain  it, but she felt the fact that her presence in the camp had a subtle  influence, at once restraining and exciting. So she looked out upon the  scene with wide-open eyes.    And she received more strongly than ever an impression of wildness. Even  the camp-fire seemed to burn wildly; it did not glow and sputter and  pale and brighten and sing like an honest camp-fire. It blazed in red,  fierce, hurried flames, wild to consume the logs. It cast a baleful  and sinister color upon the hard faces there. Then the blackness of the  enveloping night was pitchy, without any bold outline of canon wall  or companionship of stars. The coyotes were out in force and from all  around came their wild sharp barks. The wind rose and mourned weirdly  through the balsams.    But it was in the men that Joan felt mostly that element of wildness.

Caesar, to meet these two attacks, effects a change of front  (_conversa signa bipartito intulerunt_) in his third line, and opposes  it to the new assailants, while the first two lines resist the Helvetii  who had already been repulsed.[191]    This double combat was long and furious. Unable to resist the  impetuosity of their adversaries, the Helvetii were obliged to retire,  as they had done before, to the mountain of the castle of La Garde; the  Boii and Tulingi towards the baggage and wagons. Such was the  intrepidity of these Gauls during the whole action, which lasted from  one o'clock in the afternoon till evening, that not one turned his back.  Far into the night there was still fighting about the baggage. The  barbarians, having made a rampart of their wagons, some threw from  above their missiles on the Romans; others, placed between the wheels,  wounded them with long pikes (_matarae ac tragulae_). The women and  children, too, shared desperately in the combat.[192] At the end of an  obstinate struggle, the camp and baggage were taken. The daughter and  one of the sons of Orgetorix were made prisoners.    This battle reduced the Gaulish emigration to 130,000 individuals. They  began their retreat that same evening, and, after marching without  interruption day and night, they reached on the fourth day the territory  of the Lingones, towards Tonnerre (_see Plate 4_): they had, no doubt,  passed by Moulins-en-Gilbert, Lormes, and Avallon. The Lingones were  forbidden to furnish the fugitives with provisions or succour, under  pain of being treated like them. At the end of three days, the Roman  army, having taken care of their wounded and buried the dead, marched in  pursuit of the enemy.[193]      [Sidenote: Pursuit of the Helvetii.]    VII. The Helvetii, reduced to extremity, sent to Caesar to treat for  their submission. The deputies met him on his march, threw themselves at  his feet, and demanded peace in the most suppliant terms. He ordered  them to say to their fellow-countrymen that they must halt on the spot  they then occupied, and await his arrival; and they obeyed. As soon as  Caesar overtook them, he required them to deliver hostages, their arms,  and the fugitive slaves. While they were preparing to execute his  orders, night coming on, about 6,000 men of a tribe named Verbigeni  (_Soleure, Argovie, Lucerne, and part of the Canton of Berne_) fled,  either through fear that, having once delivered up their arms, they  should be massacred, or in the hope of escaping unperceived in the midst  of so great a multitude. They directed their steps towards the Rhine and  the frontiers of Germany.    On receiving news of the flight of the Verbigeni, Caesar ordered the  peoples whose territories they would cross to stop them and bring them  back, under pain of being considered as accomplices. The fugitives were  delivered up and treated as enemies; that is, put to the sword, or sold  as slaves. As to the others, Caesar accepted their submission: he  compelled the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobriges to return to the  localities they had abandoned, and to restore the towns and hamlets they  had burnt; and since, after having lost all their crops, they had no  more provisions of their own, the Allobroges were ordered to furnish  them with wheat.[194] These measures had for their object not to leave  Helvetia without inhabitants, as the fertility of its soil might draw  thither the Germans of the other side the Rhine, who would thus become  borderers upon the Roman province. He permitted the Boii, celebrated for  their brilliant valour, to establish themselves in the country of the  AEdui, who had asked permission to receive them. They gave them lands  between the Allier and the Loire, and soon admitted them to a share in  all their rights and privileges.    In the camp of the Helvetii were found tablets on which was written, in  Greek letters, the number of all those who had quitted their country: on  one side, the number of men capable of bearing arms; and on the other,  that of the children, old men, and women. The whole amounted to 263,000  Helvetii, 36,000 Tulingi, 14,000 Latobriges, 23,000 Rauraci, and 32,000  Boii--together, 368,000 persons, of whom 92,000 were men in a condition  to fight. According to the census ordered by Caesar, the number of those  who returned home was 110,000.[195] The emigration was thus reduced to  less than one-third.    The locality occupied by the Helvetii when they made their submission is  unknown; yet all circumstances seem to concur in placing the theatre of  this event in the western part of the country of the Lingones. This  hypothesis appears the more reasonable, as Caesar's march, in the  following campaign, can only be explained by supposing him to start from  this region. We admit, then, that Caesar received the submission of the  Helvetii on the Armancon, towards Tonnerre, and it is there that we  suppose him to have been encamped during the events upon the recital of  which we are now going to enter.      [Sidenote: Observations.]    VIII. The forces of the two armies opposed to each other in the battle  of Bibracte were about equal, for Caesar had six legions--the 10th, which  he had found in the Roman province; the three old legions (7th, 8th, and  9th), which he had brought from Aquileia; and the two new ones (11th and  12th), raised in the Cisalpine. The effective force of each must have  been near the normal number of 6,000 men, for the campaign had only  begun, and their ranks must have been increased by the veterans and  volunteers of whom we have spoken in the first volume (page 456). The  number of the legionaries was thus 36,000. Adding 4,000 cavalry, raised  in the Roman province and among the AEdui, and probably 20,000  auxiliaries,[196] we shall have a total of 60,000 combatants, not  including the men attached to the machines, those conducting the  baggage, the army servants, &c. The Helvetii, on their side, did not  count more than 69,000 combatants, since, out of 92,000, they had lost  one-fourth near the Saone.    In this battle, it must be remarked, Caesar did not employ the two  legions newly raised, which remained to guard the camp, and secure the  retreat in case of disaster. Next year he assigned the same duty to the  youngest troops. The cavalry did not pursue the enemies in their rout,  doubtless because the mountainous nature of the locality made it  impossible for it to act.          CHAPTER IV.    CAMPAIGN AGAINST ARIOVISTUS.    (Year of Rome 696.)    (BOOK I. OF THE \"COMMENTARIES.\")      [Sidenote: Seat of the Suevi and other German Tribes.]    I. On the termination of the war against the Helvetii, the chiefs of  nearly all Celtic Gaul went to congratulate Caesar, and thank him for  having, at the same time, avenged their old injuries, and delivered  their country from immense danger. They expressed the desire to submit  to his judgment certain affairs, and, in order to concert matters  previously, they solicited his permission to convoke a general assembly.  Caesar gave his consent.    After the close of the deliberations, they returned, secretly and in  tears, to solicit his support against the Germans and Ariovistus, one of  their kings. These peoples were separated from the Gauls by the Rhine,  from its mouth to the Lake of Constance. Among them the Suevi occupied  the first rank. They were by much the most powerful and the most  warlike. They were said to be divided into a hundred cantons, each of  which furnished, every year, a thousand men for war and a thousand men  for agriculture, taking each other's place alternately: the labourers  fed the soldiers. No boundary line, among the Suevi, separated the  property of the fields, which remained common, and no one could prolong  his residence on the same lands beyond a year. However, they hardly  lived upon the produce of the soil: they consumed little wheat, and  drank no wine; milk and flesh were their habitual food. When these  failed, they were fed upon grass.[197] Masters of themselves from  infancy, intrepid hunters, insensible to the inclemency of the seasons,  bathing in the cold waters of the rivers, they hardly covered a part of  their bodies with thin skins. They were savages in manners, and of  prodigious force and stature. They disdained commerce and foreign  horses, which the Gauls sought with so much care. Their own horses,  though mean-looking and ill-shaped, became indefatigable through  exercise, and fed upon brushwood. Despising the use of the saddle,  often, in engagements of cavalry, they jumped to the ground and fought  on foot: their horses were taught to remain without moving.[198] The  belief in the dogma of the immortality of the soul, strengthened in them  the contempt for life.[199] They boasted of being surrounded by immense  solitudes: this fact, as they pretended, showed that a great number of  their neighbours had not been able to resist them: and it was reported,  indeed, that on one side (towards the east) their territory was bounded,  for an extent of 600 miles, by desert plains; on the other, they  bordered upon the Ubii, their tributaries, the most civilised of the  German peoples, because their situation on the banks of the Rhine placed  them in relation with foreign merchants, and because, neighbours to the  Gauls, they had formed themselves to their manners.[200]    Two immense forests commenced not far from the Rhine, and extended, from  west to east, across Germany; these were the Hercynian and Bacenis  forests. (_See Plate 2._) The first, beginning from the Black Forest and  the Odenwald, covered all the country situated between the Upper Danube  and the Maine, and comprised the mountains which, further towards the  east, formed the northern girdle of the basin of the Danube; that is,  the Boehmerwald,"]]]
