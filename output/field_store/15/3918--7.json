Neither his father nor his mother observed his dissatisfaction, for  Neforis had rushed up to her husband's couch, and fallen on her knees  by his side, covering his cold, slender hand with kisses, as joyful as  though this determination had relieved her of a heavy burden of dread:  \"Our souls, our souls, George! For such a gift--only wait--you will be  forgiven all, and recover your lost peace!\"    The governor shrugged his shoulders and said nothing; the hanging was  rolled up and locked into the tablinum by Orion; then the Mukaukas bid  the chamberlain show the Arab and his followers to quarters for the  night.          CHAPTER VI.    Pangs of soul and doubtings of conscience had, in fact, prompted the  governor to purchase the hanging and he therefore might have been glad  if it had cost him still dearer. The greater the gift the better founded  his hope of grace and favor from the recipient! And he had grounds  for being uneasy and for asking himself whether he had acted rightly.  Revenge was no Christian virtue, but to let the evil done to him by the  Melchites go unpunished when the opportunity offered for crushing them  was more than he could bring himself to. Nay, what father whose two  bright young sons had been murdered, but would have done as he did? That  fearful blow had struck him in a vital spot. Since that day he had  felt himself slowly dying; and that sense of weakness, those desperate  tremors, the discomforts and suffering which blighted every hour of his  life, were also to be set down to the account of the Melchite tyrants.    His waning powers had indeed only been kept up by his original vigor and  his burning thirst for revenge, and fate had allowed him to quench it  in a way which, as time went on, seemed too absolute to his peace-loving  nature. Though not indeed by his act, still with his complicity he  saw the Byzantine Empire bereft of the rich province which Caesar had  entrusted to his rule, saw the Greeks and everything that bore the name  of Melchite driven out of Egypt with ignominy--though he would gladly  have prevented it--in many places slain like dogs by the furious  populace who hailed the Moslems as their deliverers.    Thus all the evil he had invoked on the murderers of his children and  the oppressors and torturers of his people had come upon them; his  revenge was complete. But, in the midst of his satisfaction at this  strange fulfilment of the fervent wish of years, his conscience had  lifted up its voice; new, and hitherto unknown terrors had come upon  him. He lacked the strength of mind to be a hero or a reformer. Too  great an event had been wrought through his agency, too fearful a doom  visited on thousands of men! The Christian Faith--to him the highest  consideration--had been too greatly imperilled by his act, for the  thought that he had caused all this to be calmly endurable. The  responsibility proved too heavy for his shoulders; and whenever he  repeated to himself that it was not he who had invited the Arabs into  the land, and that he must have been crushed in the attempt to repel  them, he could hear voices all round him denouncing him as the man  who had surrendered his native land to them, and he fancied himself  environed by dangers--believing those who spoke to him of assassins sent  forth by the Byzantines to kill him.--But even more appalling, was  his dread of the wrath of Heaven against the man who had betrayed a  Christian country to the Infidels. Even his consciousness of having  been, all his life long, a right-minded, just man could not fortify  him against this terror; there was but one thing which could raise his  quelled spirit: the white pillules which had long been as indispensable  to him as air and water. The kind-hearted old bishop of Memphis,  Plotinus, and his clergy had forgiveness for all; the Patriarch  Benjamin, on the contrary, had treated him as a reprobate sentenced to  eternal damnation, though at the time of this prelate's exile in the  desert he had hailed the Arabs as their deliverers from the tyranny  of the Melchites, and though George had principally contributed to his  recall and reinstatement, and had therefore counted on his support. And,  although the Mukaukas could clearly see through the secondary motives  which influenced the Patriarch, he nevertheless believed that Benjamin's  office as Shepherd of souls gave him power to close the Gates of Heaven  against any sheep in his flock.    The more firmly the Arabs took root in his land, the wiser their rule,  and the more numerous the Egyptian converts from the Cross to the  Crescent, the greater he deemed his guilt; and when, after the  accomplishment of his work of vengeance--his double treason as the  Greeks called it--instead of the wrath of God, everything fell to  his lot which men call happiness and the favors of fortune, the  superstitious man feared lest this was the wages of the Devil, into  whose clutches his hasty compact with the Moslems had driven so many  Christian souls.    He had unexpectedly fallen heir to two vast estates, and his excavators  in the Necropolis had found more gold in the old heathen tombs than all  the others put together. The Moslem Khaliff and his viceroy had left  him in office and shown him friendship and respect; the bulaites--[Town  councillors]--of the town had given him the cognomen of \"the Just\"  by acclamation of the whole municipality; his lands had never yielded  greater revenues; he received letters from his son's widow in her  convent full of happiness over the new and higher aims in life that she  had found; his grandchild, her daughter, was a creature whose bright  and lovely blossoming was a joy even to strangers; his son's frequent  epistles from Constantinople assured him that he was making progress in  all respects; and he did not forget his parents; for he was never weary  of reporting to them, of his own free impulse, every pleasure he enjoyed  and every success he won.    Thus even in a foreign land he had lived with the father and mother who  to him were all that was noblest and dearest.    And Paula! Though his wife could not feel warmly towards her the old man  regarded her presence in the house as a happy dispensation to which he  owed many a pleasant hour, not only over the draughts-board.    All these things might indeed be the wages of Satan; but if indeed it  were so, he--George the Mukaukas--would show the Evil One that he was  no servant of his, but devoted to the Saviour in whose mercy he trusted.  With what fervent gratitude to the Almighty was his soul filled for  the return of such a son! Every impulse of his being urged him to give  expression to this feeling; his terrors and gratitude alike prompted  him to spend so vast a sum in order to dedicate a matchless gift to the  Church of Christ. He viewed himself as a prisoner of war whose ransom  has just been paid, as he handed to the merchant the tablet with the  order for the money; and when he was carried to bed, and his wife was  not yet weary of thanking him for his pious intention, he felt happier  and more light-hearted than he had done for many years. Generally he  could hear Paula walking up and down her room which was over his; for  she went late to rest, and in the silence of the night would indulge  in sweet and painful memories. How many loved ones a cruel fate had  snatched from her! Father, brother, her nearest relations and friends;  all at once, by the hand of the Moslems to whom he had abandoned her  native land almost without resistance.    \"I do not hear Paula to-night,\" he remarked, glancing up as though he  missed something. \"The poor child has no doubt gone to bed early after  what passed.\"    \"Leave her alone!\" said Neforis who did not like to be interrupted in  her jubilant effusiveness, and she shrugged her shoulders angrily. \"How  she behaved herself again! We have heard a great deal too much about  charity, and though I do not want to boast of my own I am very ready to  exercise it--indeed, it is no more than my duty to show every kindness  to a destitute relation of yours. But this girl! She tries me too far,  and after all I am no more than human. I can have no pleasure in her  presence; if she comes into the room I feel as though misfortune had  crossed the threshold. Besides!--You never see such things; but Orion  thinks of her a great deal more than is good. I only wish she had been  safe out of the house!\"    \"Neforis!\" her husband said in mild reproach; and he would have reproved  her more sharply but that since he had become a slave to opium he had  lost all power of asserting himself vigorously whether in small matters  or great.    Ere long the Mukaukas had fallen into an uneasy sleep; but he opened his  eyes more frequently than usual. He missed the light footfall overhead  to which he had been accustomed for these two years past; but she who  was wont to pace the floor above half the night through had not gone  to rest as he supposed. After the events of the evening she had indeed  retired to her room with tingling cheeks and burning eyes; but the  slave-girls, who paid little attention to a guest who was no more than  endured and looked on askance by their mistress, had neglected to open  her window-shutters after sundown, as she had requested, and the room  was oppressively sultry and airless.

I  went to the Pentland Hotel in Princes Street and left there a suit-case  containing some clean linen and a change of clothes. I had been  thinking the thing out, and had come to the conclusion that I must have  a base somewhere and a fresh outfit. Then in well-worn tweeds and with  no more luggage than a small trench kit-bag, I descended upon the city  of Glasgow.    I walked from the station to the address which Blenkiron had given me.  It was a hot summer evening, and the streets were filled with  bareheaded women and weary-looking artisans. As I made my way down the  Dumbarton Road I was amazed at the number of able-bodied fellows about,  considering that you couldn't stir a mile on any British front without  bumping up against a Glasgow battalion. Then I realized that there were  such things as munitions and ships, and I wondered no more.    A stout and dishevelled lady at a close-mouth directed me to Mr Amos's  dwelling. 'Twa stairs up. Andra will be in noo, havin' his tea. He's no  yin for overtime. He's generally hame on the chap of six.' I ascended  the stairs with a sinking heart, for like all South Africans I have a  horror of dirt. The place was pretty filthy, but at each landing there  were two doors with well-polished handles and brass plates. On one I  read the name of Andrew Amos.    A man in his shirt-sleeves opened to me, a little man, without a  collar, and with an unbuttoned waistcoat. That was all I saw of him in  the dim light, but he held out a paw like a gorilla's and drew me in.    The sitting-room, which looked over many chimneys to a pale yellow sky  against which two factory stalks stood out sharply, gave me light  enough to observe him fully. He was about five feet four,  broad-shouldered, and with a great towsy head of grizzled hair. He wore  spectacles, and his face was like some old-fashioned Scots minister's,  for he had heavy eyebrows and whiskers which joined each other under  his jaw, while his chin and enormous upper lip were clean-shaven. His  eyes were steely grey and very solemn, but full of smouldering energy.  His voice was enormous and would have shaken the walls if he had not  had the habit of speaking with half-closed lips. He had not a sound  tooth in his head.    A saucer full of tea and a plate which had once contained ham and eggs  were on the table. He nodded towards them and asked me if I had fed.    'Ye'll no eat onything? Well, some would offer ye a dram, but this  house is staunch teetotal. I door ye'll have to try the nearest public  if ye're thirsty.'    I disclaimed any bodily wants, and produced my pipe, at which he  started to fill an old clay. 'Mr Brand's your name?' he asked in his  gusty voice. 'I was expectin' ye, but Dod! man ye're late!'    He extricated from his trousers pocket an ancient silver watch, and  regarded it with disfavour. 'The dashed thing has stoppit. What do ye  make the time, Mr Brand?'    He proceeded to prise open the lid of his watch with the knife he had  used to cut his tobacco, and, as he examined the works, he turned the  back of the case towards me. On the inside I saw pasted Mary  Lamington's purple-and-white wafer.    I held my watch so that he could see the same token. His keen eyes,  raised for a second, noted it, and he shut his own with a snap and  returned it to his pocket. His manner lost its wariness and became  almost genial.    'Ye've come up to see Glasgow, Mr Brand? Well, it's a steerin' bit, and  there's honest folk bides in it, and some not so honest. They tell me  ye're from South Africa. That's a long gait away, but I ken something  aboot South Africa, for I had a cousin's son oot there for his lungs.  He was in a shop in Main Street, Bloomfountain. They called him Peter  Dobson. Ye would maybe mind of him.'    Then he discoursed of the Clyde. He was an incomer, he told me, from  the Borders, his native place being the town of Galashiels, or, as he  called it, 'Gawly'. 'I began as a powerloom tuner in Stavert's mill.  Then my father dee'd and I took up his trade of jiner. But it's no  world nowadays for the sma' independent business, so I cam to the Clyde  and learned a shipwright's job. I may say I've become a leader in the  trade, for though I'm no an official of the Union, and not likely to  be, there's no man's word carries more weight than mine. And the  Goavernment kens that, for they've sent me on commissions up and down  the land to look at wuds and report on the nature of the timber.  Bribery, they think it is, but Andrew Amos is not to be bribit. He'll  have his say about any Goavernment on earth, and tell them to their  face what he thinks of them. Ay, and he'll fight the case of the  workingman against his oppressor, should it be the Goavernment or the  fatted calves they ca' Labour Members. Ye'll have heard tell o' the  shop stewards, Mr Brand?'    I admitted I had, for I had been well coached by Blenkiron in the  current history of industrial disputes.    'Well, I'm a shop steward. We represent the rank and file against  office-bearers that have lost the confidence o' the workingman. But I'm  no socialist, and I would have ye keep mind of that. I'm yin o' the old  Border radicals, and I'm not like to change. I'm for individual liberty  and equal rights and chances for all men. I'll no more bow down before  a Dagon of a Goavernment official than before the Baal of a feckless  Tweedside laird. I've to keep my views to mysel', for thae young lads  are all drucken-daft with their wee books about Cawpital and  Collectivism and a wheen long senseless words I wouldna fyle my tongue  with. Them and their socialism! There's more gumption in a page of John  Stuart Mill than in all that foreign trash. But, as I say, I've got to  keep a quiet sough, for the world is gettin' socialism now like the  measles. It all comes of a defective eddication.'    'And what does a Border radical say about the war?' I asked.    He took off his spectacles and cocked his shaggy brows at me. 'I'll  tell ye, Mr Brand. All that was bad in all that I've ever wrestled with  since I cam to years o' discretion--Tories and lairds and manufacturers  and publicans and the Auld Kirk--all that was bad, I say, for there  were orra bits of decency, ye'll find in the Germans full measure  pressed down and running over. When the war started, I considered the  subject calmly for three days, and then I said: \"Andra Amos, ye've  found the enemy at last. The ones ye fought before were in a manner o'  speakin' just misguided friends. It's either you or the Kaiser this  time, my man!\"'    His eyes had lost their gravity and had taken on a sombre ferocity.  'Ay, and I've not wavered. I got a word early in the business as to the  way I could serve my country best. It's not been an easy job, and  there's plenty of honest folk the day will give me a bad name. They  think I'm stirrin' up the men at home and desertin' the cause o' the  lads at the front. Man, I'm keepin' them straight. If I didna fight  their battles on a sound economic isshue, they would take the dorts and  be at the mercy of the first blagyird that preached revolution. Me and  my like are safety-valves, if ye follow me. And dinna you make ony  mistake, Mr Brand. The men that are agitating for a rise in wages are  not for peace. They're fighting for the lads overseas as much as for  themselves. There's not yin in a thousand that wouldna sweat himself  blind to beat the Germans. The Goavernment has made mistakes, and maun  be made to pay for them. If it were not so, the men would feel like a  moose in a trap, for they would have no way to make their grievance  felt. What for should the big man double his profits and the small man  be ill set to get his ham and egg on Sabbath mornin'? That's the  meaning o' Labour unrest, as they call it, and it's a good thing, says  I, for if Labour didna get its leg over the traces now and then, the  spunk o' the land would be dead in it, and Hindenburg could squeeze it  like a rotten aipple.'    I asked if he spoke for the bulk of the men.    'For ninety per cent in ony ballot. I don't say that there's not plenty  of riff-raff--the pint-and-a-dram gentry and the soft-heads that are  aye reading bits of newspapers, and muddlin' their wits with foreign  whigmaleeries. But the average man on the Clyde, like the average man  in ither places, hates just three things, and that's the Germans, the  profiteers, as they call them, and the Irish. But he hates the Germans  first.'    'The Irish!' I exclaimed in astonishment.    'Ay, the Irish,' cried the last of the old Border radicals. 'Glasgow's  stinkin' nowadays with two things, money and Irish. I mind the day when  I followed Mr Gladstone's Home Rule policy, and used to threep about  the noble, generous, warm-hearted sister nation held in a foreign  bondage. My Goad! I'm not speakin' about Ulster, which is a dour,  ill-natured den, but our own folk all the same. But the men that will  not do a hand's turn to help the war and take the chance of our  necessities to set up a bawbee rebellion are hateful to Goad and man.  We treated them like pet lambs and that's the thanks we get. They're  coming over here in thousands to tak the jobs of the lads that are  doing their duty. I was speakin' last week to a widow woman that keeps  a wee dairy down the Dalmarnock Road. She has two sons, and both in the  airmy, one in the Cameronians and one a prisoner in Germany. She was  telling me that she could not keep goin' any more, lacking the help of  the boys, though she had worked her fingers to the bone. \"Surely it's a  crool job, Mr Amos,\" she says, \"that the Goavernment should tak baith  my laddies, and I'll maybe never see them again, and let the Irish gang  free and tak the bread frae our mouth. At the gasworks across the road  they took on a hundred Irish last week, and every yin o' them as young  and well set up as you would ask to see. And my wee Davie, him that's  in Germany, had aye a weak chest,"]]]
