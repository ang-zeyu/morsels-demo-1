Sweet as the harp of David, the night-  breeze and the music of the water come up from the sea; but the ripple and  the rustling sound alternate with the hyena's laugh, the jackal's cry, and  the wild dog's lengthened howl.    Or, the weather becoming cold, we remain below, and Mohammed Umar returns  to read out more \"Book of Lights,\" or some pathetic ode. I will quote in  free translation the following production of the celebrated poet Abd el  Rahman el Burai, as a perfect specimen of melancholy Arab imagery:      \"No exile is the banished to the latter end of earth,    The exile is the banished to the coffin and the tomb      \"He hath claims on the dwellers in the places of their birth    Who wandereth the world, for he lacketh him a home.      \"Then, blamer, blame me not, were my heart within thy breast,    The sigh would take the place of thy laughter and thy scorn.      \"Let me weep for the sin that debars my soul of rest,    The tear may yet avail,--all in vain I may not mourn! [22]      \"Woe! woe to thee, Flesh!--with a purer spirit now    The death-day were a hope, and the judgment-hour a joy!      \"One morn I woke in pain, with a pallor on my brow,    As though the dreaded Angel were descending to destroy:      \"They brought to me a leech, saying, 'Heal him lest he die!'    On that day, by Allah, were his drugs a poor deceit!      \"They stripped me and bathed me, and closed the glazing eye,    And dispersed unto prayers, and to haggle for my sheet.      \"The prayers without a bow [23] they prayed over me that day,    Brought nigh to me the bier, and disposed me within.      \"Four bare upon their shoulders this tenement of clay,    Friend and kinsmen in procession bore the dust of friend and kin.      \"They threw upon me mould of the tomb and went their way--    A guest, 'twould seem, had flitted from the dwellings of the tribe!      \"My gold and my treasures each a share they bore away,    Without thanks, without praise, with a jest and with a jibe.      \"My gold and my treasures each his share they bore away,    On me they left the weight!--with me they left the sin!      \"That night within the grave without hoard or child I lay,    No spouse, no friend were there, no comrade and no kin.      \"The wife of my youth, soon another husband found--    A stranger sat at home on the hearthstone of my sire.      \"My son became a slave, though not purchased nor bound,    The hireling of a stranger, who begrudged him his hire.      \"Such, alas, is human life! such the horror of his death!    Man grows like a grass, like a god he sees no end.      \"Be wise, then, ere too late, brother! praise with every breath    The hand that can chastise, the arm that can defend:      \"And bless thou the Prophet, the averter of our ills,    While the lightning flasheth bright o'er the ocean and the hills.\"    At this hour my companions become imaginative and superstitious. One  Salimayn, a black slave from the Sawahil [24], now secretary to the Hajj,  reads our fortunes in the rosary. The \"fal\" [25], as it is called, acts a  prominent part in Somali life. Some men are celebrated for accuracy of  prediction; and in times of danger, when the human mind is ever open to  the \"fooleries of faith,\" perpetual reference is made to their art. The  worldly wise Salimayn, I observed, never sent away a questioner with an  ill-omened reply, but he also regularly insisted upon the efficacy of  sacrifice and almsgiving, which, as they would assuredly be neglected,  afforded him an excuse in case of accident. Then we had a recital of the  tales common to Africa, and perhaps to all the world. In modern France, as  in ancient Italy, \"versipelles\" become wolves and hide themselves in the  woods: in Persia they change themselves into bears, and in Bornou and Shoa  assume the shapes of lions, hyenas, and leopards. [26] The origin of this  metamorphic superstition is easily traceable, like man's fetisism or  demonology, to his fears: a Bedouin, for instance, becomes dreadful by the  reputation of sorcery: bears and hyenas are equally terrible; and the two  objects of horror are easily connected. Curious to say, individuals having  this power were pointed out to me, and people pretended to discover it in  their countenances: at Zayla I was shown a Bedouin, by name Farih Badaun,  who notably became a hyena at times, for the purpose of tasting human  blood. [27] About forty years ago, three brothers, Kayna, Fardayna, and  Sollan, were killed on Gulays near Berberah for the crime of  metamorphosis. The charge is usually substantiated either by the bestial  tail remaining appended to a part of the human shape which the owner has  forgotten to rub against the magic tree, or by some peculiar wound which  the beast received and the man retained. Kindred to this superstition is  the belief that many of the Bedouins have learned the languages of birds  and beasts. Another widely diffused fancy is that of the Aksar [28], which  in this pastoral land becomes a kind of wood: wonderful tales are told of  battered milk-pails which, by means of some peg accidentally cut in the  jungle, have been found full of silver, or have acquired the qualities of  cornucopiae. It is supposed that a red heifer always breaks her fast upon  the wonderful plant, consequently much time and trouble have been expended  by the Somal in watching the morning proceedings of red heifers. At other  times we hear fearful tales of old women who, like the Jigar Khwar of  Persia, feed upon man's liver: they are fond of destroying young children;  even adults are not ashamed of defending themselves with talismans. In  this country the crone is called Bidaa or Kumayyo, words signifying a  witch: the worst is she that destroys her own progeny. No wound is visible  in this vampyre's victim: generally he names his witch, and his friends  beat her to death unless she heal him: many are thus martyred; and in  Somali land scant notice is taken of such a peccadillo as murdering an old  woman. The sex indeed has by no means a good name: here, as elsewhere,  those who degrade it are the first to abuse it for degradation. At Zayla  almost all quarrels are connected with women; the old bewitch in one way,  the young in another, and both are equally maligned. \"Wit in a woman,\"  exclaims one man, \"is a habit of running away in a dromedary.\" \"Allah,\"  declares another, \"made woman of a crooked bone; he who would straighten  her, breaketh her.\" Perhaps, however, by these generalisms of abuse the  sex gains: they prevent personal and individual details; and no society of  French gentlemen avoids mentioning in public the name of a woman more  scrupulously than do the misogynist Moslems.    After a conversazione of two hours my visitors depart, and we lose no  time--for we must rise at cockcrow--in spreading our mats round the common  room. You would admire the Somali pillow [29], a dwarf pedestal of carved  wood, with a curve upon which the greasy poll and its elaborate _frisure_  repose. Like the Abyssinian article, it resembles the head-rest of ancient  Egypt in all points, except that it is not worked with Typhons and other  horrors to drive away dreadful dreams. Sometimes the sound of the  kettledrum, the song, and the clapping of hands, summon us at a later hour  than usual to a dance. The performance is complicated, and, as usual with  the trivialities easily learned in early youth, it is uncommonly difficult  to a stranger. Each dance has its own song and measure, and, contrary to  the custom of El Islam, the sexes perform together. They begin by clapping  the hands and stamping where they stand; to this succeed advancing,  retiring, wheeling about, jumping about, and the other peculiarities of  the Jim Crow school. The principal measures are those of Ugadayn and  Batar; these again are divided and subdivided;--I fancy that the  description of Dileho, Jibwhayn, and Hobala would be as entertaining and  instructive to you, dear L., as Polka, Gavotte, and Mazurka would be to a  Somali.    On Friday--our Sunday--a drunken crier goes about the town, threatening  the bastinado to all who neglect their five prayers. At half-past eleven a  kettledrum sounds a summons to the Jami or Cathedral. It is an old barn  rudely plastered with whitewash; posts or columns of artless masonry  support the low roof, and the smallness of the windows, or rather air-  holes, renders its dreary length unpleasantly hot. There is no pulpit; the  only ornament is a rude representation of the Meccan Mosque, nailed like a  pothouse print to the wall; and the sole articles of furniture are ragged  mats and old boxes, containing tattered chapters of the Koran in greasy  bindings. I enter with a servant carrying a prayer carpet, encounter the  stare of 300 pair of eyes, belonging to parallel rows of squatters, recite  the customary two-bow prayer in honor of the mosque, placing sword and  rosary before me, and then, taking up a Koran, read the Cow Chapter (No.  18.) loud and twangingly. At the Zohr or mid-day hour, the Muezzin inside  the mosque, standing before the Khatib or preacher, repeats the call to  prayer, which the congregation, sitting upon their shins and feet, intone  after him. This ended, all present stand up, and recite every man for  himself, a two-bow prayer of Sunnat or Example, concluding with the  blessing on the Prophet and the Salam over each shoulder to all brother  Believers. The Khatib then ascends his hole in the wall, which serves for  pulpit, and thence addresses us with \"The peace be upon you, and the mercy  of Allah, and his benediction;\" to which we respond through the Muezzin,  \"And upon you be peace, and Allah's mercy!\" After sundry other religious  formulas and their replies, concluding with a second"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/689"],[0,"The Kreutzer Sonata and Other Stories (#11)"],[1,"not only did not improve our  relations as husband and wife, but, on the contrary, disunited us. The  children became an additional cause of dispute, and the larger they  grew, the more they became an instrument of struggle.    \"One would have said that we used them as weapons with which to combat  each other. Each of us had his favorite. I made use of little Basile  (the eldest), she of Lise. Further, when the children reached an age  where their characters began to be defined, they became allies, which we  drew each in his or her own direction. They suffered horribly from this,  the poor things, but we, in our perpetual hubbub, were not clear-headed  enough to think of them. The little girl was devoted to me, but the  eldest boy, who resembled my wife, his favorite, often inspired me with  dislike.\"        CHAPTER XVII.    \"We lived at first in the country, then in the city, and, if the final  misfortune had not happened, I should have lived thus until my old age  and should then have believed that I had had a good life,--not too good,  but, on the other hand, not bad,--an existence such as other people  lead. I should not have understood the abyss of misfortune and ignoble  falsehood in which I floundered about, feeling that something was not  right. I felt, in the first place, that I, a man, who, according to my  ideas, ought to be the master, wore the petticoats, and that I could not  get rid of them. The principal cause of my subjection was the children.  I should have liked to free myself, but I could not. Bringing up the  children, and resting upon them, my wife ruled. I did not then realize  that she could not help ruling, especially because, in marrying, she was  morally superior to me, as every young girl is incomparably superior to  the man, since she is incomparably purer. Strange thing! The ordinary  wife in our society is a very commonplace person or worse, selfish,  gossiping, whimsical, whereas the ordinary young girl, until the age of  twenty, is a charming being, ready for everything that is beautiful  and lofty. Why is this so? Evidently because husbands pervert them, and  lower them to their own level.    \"In truth, if boys and girls are born equal, the little girls find  themselves in a better situation. In the first place, the young girl is  not subjected to the perverting conditions to which we are subjected.  She has neither cigarettes, nor wine, nor cards, nor comrades, nor  public houses, nor public functions. And then the chief thing is that  she is physically pure, and that is why, in marrying, she is superior  to her husband. She is superior to man as a young girl, and when she  becomes a wife in our society, where there is no need to work in order  to live, she becomes superior, also, by the gravity of the acts of  generation, birth, and nursing.    \"Woman, in bringing a child into the world, and giving it her bosom,  sees clearly that her affair is more serious than the affair of man, who  sits in the Zemstvo, in the court. She knows that in these functions the  main thing is money, and money can be made in different ways, and for  that very reason money is not inevitably necessary, like nursing a  child. Consequently woman is necessarily superior to man, and must rule.  But man, in our society, not only does not recognize this, but, on  the contrary, always looks upon her from the height of his grandeur,  despising what she does.    \"Thus my wife despised me for my work at the Zemstvo, because she gave  birth to children and nursed them. I, in turn, thought that woman's  labor was most contemptible, which one might and should laugh at.    \"Apart from the other motives, we were also separated by a mutual  contempt. Our relations grew ever more hostile, and we arrived at that  period when, not only did dissent provoke hostility, but hostility  provoked dissent. Whatever she might say, I was sure in advance to hold  a contrary opinion; and she the same. Toward the fourth year of  our marriage it was tacitly decided between us that no intellectual  community was possible, and we made no further attempts at it. As to  the simplest objects, we each held obstinately to our own opinions. With  strangers we talked upon the most varied and most intimate matters, but  not with each other. Sometimes, in listening to my wife talk with others  in my presence, I said to myself: 'What a woman! Everything that she  says is a lie!' And I was astonished that the person with whom she was  conversing did not see that she was lying. When we were together; we  were condemned to silence, or to conversations which, I am sure, might  have been carried on by animals.    \"'What time is it? It is bed-time. What is there for dinner to-day?  Where shall we go? What is there in the newspaper? The doctor must be  sent for, Lise has a sore throat.'    \"Unless we kept within the extremely narrow limits of such conversation,  irritation was sure to ensue. The presence of a third person relieved  us, for through an intermediary we could still communicate. She probably  believed that she was always right. As for me, in my own eyes, I was a  saint beside her.    \"The periods of what we call love arrived as often as formerly. They  were more brutal, without refinement, without ornament; but they were  short, and generally followed by periods of irritation without cause,  irritation fed by the most trivial pretexts. We had spats about the  coffee, the table-cloth, the carriage, games of cards,--trifles, in  short, which could not be of the least importance to either of us. As  for me, a terrible execration was continually boiling up within me. I  watched her pour the tea, swing her foot, lift her spoon to her mouth,  and blow upon hot liquids or sip them, and I detested her as if these  had been so many crimes.    \"I did not notice that these periods of irritation depended very  regularly upon the periods of love. Each of the latter was followed  by one of the former. A period of intense love was followed by a long  period of anger; a period of mild love induced a mild irritation. We did  not understand that this love and this hatred were two opposite faces  of the same animal feeling. To live thus would be terrible, if one  understood the philosophy of it. But we did not perceive this, we did  not analyze it. It is at once the torture and the relief of man that,  when he lives irregularly, he can cherish illusions as to the miseries  of his situation. So did we. She tried to forget herself in sudden and  absorbing occupations, in household duties, the care of the furniture,  her dress and that of her children, in the education of the latter, and  in looking after their health. These were occupations that did not arise  from any immediate necessity, but she accomplished them as if her life  and that of her children depended on whether the pastry was allowed  to burn, whether a curtain was hanging properly, whether a dress was a  success, whether a lesson was well learned, or whether a medicine was  swallowed.    \"I saw clearly that to her all this was, more than anything else, a  means of forgetting, an intoxication, just as hunting, card-playing, and  my functions at the Zemstvo served the same purpose for me. It is true  that in addition I had an intoxication literally speaking,--tobacco,  which I smoked in large quantities, and wine, upon which I did not get  drunk, but of which I took too much. Vodka before meals, and during  meals two glasses of wine, so that a perpetual mist concealed the  turmoil of existence.    \"These new theories of hypnotism, of mental maladies, of hysteria are  not simple stupidities, but dangerous or evil stupidities. Charcot, I  am sure, would have said that my wife was hysterical, and of me he would  have said that I was an abnormal being, and he would have wanted to  treat me. But in us there was nothing requiring treatment. All this  mental malady was the simple result of the fact that we were living  immorally. Thanks to this immoral life, we suffered, and, to stifle  our sufferings, we tried abnormal means, which the doctors call the  'symptoms' of a mental malady,--hysteria.    \"There was no occasion in all this to apply for treatment to Charcot  or to anybody else. Neither suggestion nor bromide would have been  effective in working our cure. The needful thing was an examination of  the origin of the evil. It is as when one is sitting on a nail; if you  see the nail, you see that which is irregular in your life, and you  avoid it. Then the pain stops, without any necessity of stifling it. Our  pain arose from the irregularity of our life, and also my jealousy,  my irritability, and the necessity of keeping myself in a state of  perpetual semi-intoxication by hunting, card-playing, and, above all,  the use of wine and tobacco. It was because of this irregularity that my  wife so passionately pursued her occupations. The sudden changes of her  disposition, from extreme sadness to extreme gayety, and her babble,  arose from the need of forgetting herself, of forgetting her life, in  the continual intoxication of varied and very brief occupations.    \"Thus we lived in a perpetual fog, in which we did not distinguish our  condition. We were like two galley-slaves fastened to the same ball,  cursing each other, poisoning each other's existence, and trying to  shake each other off. I was still unaware that ninety-nine families out  of every hundred live in the same hell, and that it cannot be otherwise.  I had not learned this fact from others or from myself. The coincidences  that are met in regular, and even in irregular life, are surprising. At  the very period when the life of parents becomes impossible, it becomes  indispensable that they go to the city to live, in order to educate  their children. That is what we did.\"    Posdnicheff became silent, and twice there escaped him, in the  half-darkness, sighs, which at that moment seemed to me like suppressed  sobs. Then he"]]]
