History proved that neither Gioberti nor Pius  IX. was correct, but the seeming coincidence of their views increased  the power of each. Gioberti gained the support of the liberal element  in the Church, and the Pope gained the adhesion of intellectual men  throughout Italy.    The new Pope had read Gioberti's political writings, and had been deeply  influenced by them. The \"Primato,\" issued at Brussels in 1842, had been  prohibited in all the Italian states except Piedmont, and this fact  added immensely to its weight with patriots. Charles Albert read it  and admired it greatly; with the advent of Pius, he as well as men so  diverse as Mazzini, Garibaldi, and D'Azeglio, looked for regeneration.  Under the influence of this new spirit Charles Albert declared an  amnesty for all exiles in 1846, and the philosopher-priest, after  thirteen years of exile, was free to return home.    Long exile had somewhat crushed the ardent nature of the churchman,  and he waited in Brussels until he was assured by friends that his  return to Turin would be popular. Learning that his works, especially  the \"Primato\" and the \"Gesuita Moderno,\" had made him a hero in the  eyes of patriots, he finally returned to Turin in 1848. His entrance  into the capital on April 29 of that year was the occasion for the  greatest outburst of enthusiasm, a welcome intensified by the thought  that this man had been banished for no other cause than the resentment  of the hated Jesuits. The city was decorated and illuminated in his  honor, deputations waited upon him, the King appointed him a Senator,  but, as he had been elected as deputy by both Turin and Genoa to the  Assembly of Representatives now to meet for the first time under the new  constitution, he chose to sit in the lower house for Turin.    Invitations now poured in upon him from other cities, and before the  Assembly met he made a tour of the states, commencing with Milan, and  finally reaching Rome. He had three interviews with the Pope, and these  meetings led him still further to believe that Pius was the man who  should put his political philosophy into practice. He found the Romans,  who of all Italians had most cause to hate the Jesuits, overjoyed with  his work describing the modern abuses of that order, and anxious at  all hazards that their new Pontiff should follow the new spirit of  liberality.    While he was traveling and speaking publicly to all the peoples the  Assembly met in Turin, and elected him its president. Count Balbo was  Prime Minister, and in the same Parliament sat many of the younger  element, including Cavour, and a large liberal section headed by  D'Azeglio.    Meanwhile there had occurred the memorable battle-days of 1848, when  the February revolution in Paris set fire to the tinder that had been  preparing throughout Europe. The Milanese arose and drove out the  Austrian garrison, Venice proclaimed the republic under Daniel Manin,  and the cry of \"a free Italy\" rang from the Alps to Sicily. Pius IX.,  who had already made serious protest to Austria when in the preceding  year that Power had garrisoned Ferrara, prepared to place himself  actively at the head of the national movement, and in Piedmont Charles  Albert took the field and went to the aid of Lombardy. At the close  of 1848 Count Balbo resigned, and a new ministry was formed, in which  Gioberti held a seat.    Unfortunately Pius IX. lacked the courage of his convictions, and  when he heard that the Austrians were winning back their lost fields  in Lombardy, his desire to send his troops to the aid of Piedmont  cooled. The conservative elements about him gained his ear, and he  replaced Mamiani, his Prime Minister, a man who wished him to give  Rome a constitution, with Count Rossi, the French Ambassador, a man of  great ability, but ultra conservative. In November, 1848, Rossi was  assassinated, and shortly afterward the violence of the demands of the  people convinced Pius that his best course was temporary flight. Acting  upon this impulse on November 24, 1848, he escaped from Rome to Gaeta.  Italy was beginning to see to what manner of man it had looked for  deliverance.    From Gaeta the self-exiled Pontiff issued a formal protest against  the violence to which he stated his people had subjected him, and by  which means alone his latest enactments had been extorted from him, and  declared all measures passed in Rome during his absence null and void.    In Rome the brief Republic of Mazzini held sway, and at Gaeta France and  Austria sought to cheer the Pope. Charles Albert, his hope of Papal aid  fading rapidly, attempted for a few months to stem the tide of French  and Austrian influence over Pius. He tried to effect a reconciliation  between the Holy Father and the Romans, and Gioberti wrote to the Pope,  saying: \"I hope the Court of Gaeta is about to return to sentiments  more evangelical, more worthy of Pius IX. I am sorry to have to say  that the Court of Gaeta, repudiating the doctrine of conciliation, and  adopting that of vengeance and blood, does not seem to know that it  is repudiating the maxims of Christ, and putting in their stead those  of Mahomet.\" In addition Gioberti did his best to gain the Pope's  concurrence in a plan for the formation of an Italian federation of  princes, but without success. The bolt was shot, Pius had had his day  as popular idol, and having proven that Italy had nothing to hope  politically from the Pope, quickly retroceded to the plane of the  Bourbon Princes and Grand Dukes. To Gioberti, who had hoped so much  from the spiritual and temporal power of Rome, the disillusionment was  terrific.    That he was a theorist rather than a practical statesman he now showed  conclusively by advocating as minister at Turin that Piedmont should  anticipate the inevitable restoration of the rulers of central Italy  by the governments of Austria and France by restoring them itself. Had  this plan been adopted the House of Savoy would have been irretrievably  ruined in the eyes of patriotic Italy, and the country left without any  champion of freedom. Fortunately his proposal met with small favor.    The battle of Novara ended the struggles of Charles Albert, and Victor  Emmanuel, a man of sterner make, came into control. A new ministry was  formed for the new King by General Delaunay, who included Gioberti again  in the cabinet, although he held no portfolio. He was not in touch,  however, with the new elements of government, he could not appreciate a  statecraft that was in essence radical, and after several disagreements  he was appointed on a nominal mission to Paris, which in reality removed  him from any part in the government at Turin. His best work had been  done in the service of Charles Albert, he was not in touch with the  coming policies of the adroit Cavour.    The stirring years of 1848 and 1849 passed, the dream of the Pope's  leadership vanished, and the yoke of the foreigner seemed to have  settled as heavily as ever upon the states of Italy. Again exiles  gathered in London and Paris, Mazzini returned to his English  fogs, and we find Gioberti the confidant in Paris of many banished  fellow-countrymen. The Marquis Pallavicino, friend of Manin and many  other patriots, became his bosom friend. He was offered a pension by  his government, but declined it, and devoted himself to writing. In  1851 he published his great work, the \"Rinnovamento Civile d'Italia,\"  in which he pointed out the mistakes made by Italians in 1848 and 1849,  acknowledged his own blunders in political sagacity, and designated  Piedmont as the leader of a great national movement, which should  ultimately end in a regenerated Italy, with its capital in a lay and  constitutional Rome. He had met and talked with Cavour in Paris during  the preparation of this book, and he had had the perspicacity to predict  that Cavour was the man who should unite his land. The statesman  was half amused, half impressed by Gioberti's words, he had always  considered him a man who just failed of being a great statesman because  he was a visionary, but he was profoundly impressed by the grasp and  depth of his new work.    The \"Rinnovamento\" was indeed true prophecy, the philosopher had at  last seen the futility of a political confederation of peoples under a  religious head, he realized that Princes supported by foreign Powers  would never unite for any common end. \"Except the young sovereign  who rules Piedmont,\" he says in the \"Rinnovamento,\" \"I see no one in  Italy who could undertake our emancipation. Instead of imitating Pius,  Ferdinand, and Leopold, who violated their sworn compacts, he maintains  his with religious observance--vulgar praise in other times, but to-day  not small, being contrary to example.\" Victor Emmanuel, reading the  book, was as much impressed by it as Cavour had been, and time and again  repeated, \"I will do what Gioberti says.\"    Pius IX., still amiable, still suave, was kept in Rome by French arms,  and was solely occupied in proving his own insufficiency as a temporal  ruler of any sort whatever. He had retracted all his liberal acts,  made friends with all his old foes, and placed entire charge of state  affairs in the hands of that most unsavory of men, Cardinal Antonelli.  Under him the Jesuits resumed their former activity, and soon had closed  completely about the Pope. Then it was that the works of Gioberti, the  \"Primato\" and the \"Prolegomeni,\" which had once so greatly delighted the  Pope, were placed upon the Index Expurgatorius and publicly condemned  by the Church. The action had no other effect than to amuse the  world; Italy and all friends of Italy had read and pondered the great  treatises, and drawn their own conclusions from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T.

Things gradually came into shape, a  semi-monthly courier line was established from Yerba Buena to San  Diego, and we were thus enabled to keep pace with events throughout  the country.  In March Stevenson's regiment arrived.  Colonel Mason  also arrived by sea from Callao in the store-ship Erie, and P. St.  George Cooke's battalion of Mormons reached San Luis Rey.  A. J.  Smith and George Stoneman were with him, and were assigned to the  company of dragoons at Los Angeles.  All these troops and the navy  regarded General Kearney as the rightful commander, though Fremont  still remained at Los Angeles, styling himself as Governor, issuing  orders and holding his battalion of California Volunteers in  apparent defiance of General Kearney.  Colonel Mason and Major  Turner were sent down by sea with a paymaster, with muster-rolls and  orders to muster this battalion into the service of the United  States, to pay and then to muster them out; but on their reaching  Los Angeles Fremont would not consent to it, and the controversy  became so angry that a challenge was believed to have passed between  Mason and Fremont, but the duel never came about.  Turner rode up by  land in four or five days, and Fremont, becoming alarmed, followed  him, as we supposed, to overtake him, but he did not succeed.  On  Fremont's arrival at Monterey, he camped in a tent about a mile out  of town and called on General Kearney, and it was reported that the  latter threatened him very severely and ordered him back to Los  Angeles immediately, to disband his volunteers, and to cease the  exercise of authority of any kind in the country. Feeling a natural  curiosity to see Fremont, who was then quite famous by reason of his  recent explorations and the still more recent conflicts with Kearney  and Mason, I rode out to his camp, and found him in a conical tent  with one Captain Owens, who was a mountaineer, trapper, etc., but  originally from Zanesville, Ohio. I spent an hour or so with Fremont  in his tent, took some tea with him, and left, without being much  impressed with him.  In due time Colonel Swords returned from the  Sandwich Islands and relieved me as quartermaster.  Captain William  G. Marcy, son of the Secretary of War, had also come out in one of  Stevenson's ships as an assistant commissary of subsistence, and was  stationed at Monterey and relieved me as commissary, so that I  reverted to the condition of a company-officer.  While acting as a  staff officer I had lived at the custom-house in Monterey, but when  relieved I took a tent in line with the other company-officers on  the hill, where we had a mess.    Stevenson'a regiment reached San Francisco Bay early in March,  1847.  Three companies were stationed at the Presidio under Major  James A. Hardier one company (Brackett's) at Sonoma; three, under  Colonel Stevenson, at Monterey; and three, under Lieutenant-Colonel  Burton, at Santa Barbara.  One day I was down at the headquarters  at Larkin's horse, when General Kearney remarked to me that he was  going down to Los Angeles in the ship Lexington, and wanted me to  go along as his aide.  Of course this was most agreeable to me.  Two of Stevenson's companies, with the headquarters and the  colonel, were to go also.  They embarked, and early in May we  sailed for San Pedro.  Before embarking, the United States  line-of-battle-ship Columbus had reached the coast from China with  Commodore Biddle, whose rank gave him the supreme command of the  navy on the coast.  He was busy in calling in--\"lassooing \"--from  the land-service the various naval officers who under Stockton had  been doing all sorts of military and civil service on shore.  Knowing that I was to go down the coast with General Kearney, he  sent for me and handed me two unsealed parcels addressed to  Lieutenant Wilson, United States Navy, and Major Gillespie, United  States Marines, at Los Angeles.  These were written orders pretty  much in these words: \"On receipt of this order you will repair at  once on board the United States ship Lexington at San Pedro, and on  reaching Monterey you will report to the undersigned.-JAMES  BIDDLE.\"   Of course, I executed my part to the letter, and these  officers were duly \"lassooed.\"  We sailed down the coast with a  fair wind, and anchored inside the kelp, abreast of Johnson's  house.  Messages were forthwith dispatched up to Los Angeles,  twenty miles off, and preparations for horses made for us to ride  up.  We landed, and, as Kearney held to my arm in ascending the  steep path up the bluff, he remarked to himself, rather than to me,  that it was strange that Fremont did not want to return north by  the Lexington on account of sea-sickness, but preferred to go by  land over five hundred miles.  The younger officers had been  discussing what the general would do with Fremont, who was supposed  to be in a state of mutiny.  Some, thought he would be tried and  shot, some that he would be carried back in irons; and all agreed  that if any one else than Fremont had put on such airs, and had  acted as he had done, Kearney would have shown him no mercy, for he  was regarded as the strictest sort of a disciplinarian.  We had a  pleasant ride across the plain which lies between the seashore and  Los Angeles, which we reached in about three hours, the infantry  following on foot.  We found Colonel P. St. George Cooke living at  the house of a Mr. Pryor, and the company of dragoons, with A. J.  Smith, Davidson, Stoneman, and Dr. Griffin, quartered in an  adobe-house close by.  Fremont held his court in the only two-story  frame-house in the place.  After sometime spent at Pryor's house,  General Kearney ordered me to call on Fremont to notify him of his  arrival, and that he desired to see him.  I walked round to the  house which had been pointed out to me as his, inquired of a man at  the door if the colonel was in, was answered \"Yea,\" and was  conducted to a large room on the second floor, where very soon  Fremont came in, and I delivered my message.  As I was on the point  of leaving, he inquired where I was going to, and I answered that I  was going back to Pryor's house, where the general was, when he  remarked that if I would wait a moment he would go along.  Of  course I waited, and he soon joined me, dressed much as a  Californian, with the peculiar high, broad-brimmed hat, with a  fancy cord, and we walked together back to Pryor's, where I left  him with General Kearney.  We spent several days very pleasantly at  Los Angeles, then, as now, the chief pueblo of the south, famous  for its grapes, fruits, and wines.  There was a hill close to the  town, from which we had a perfect view of the place.  The  surrounding country is level, utterly devoid of trees, except the  willows and cotton-woods that line the Los Angeles Creek and the  acequias, or ditches, which lead from it.  The space of ground  cultivated in vineyards seemed about five miles by one, embracing  the town.  Every house had its inclosure of vineyard, which  resembled a miniature orchard, the vines being very old, ranged in  rows, trimmed very close, with irrigating ditches so arranged that  a stream of water could be diverted between each row of vines.  The  Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers are fed by melting snows from a  range of mountains to the east, and the quantity of cultivated land  depends upon the amount of water.  This did not seem to be very  large; but the San Gabriel River, close by, was represented to  contain a larger volume of water, affording the means of greatly  enlarging the space for cultivation.  The climate was so moderate  that oranges, figs, pomegranates, etc....  were generally to be  found in every yard or inclosure.    At the time of our visit, General Kearney was making his  preparations to return overland to the United States, and he  arranged to secure a volunteer escort out of the battalion of  Mormons that was then stationed at San Luis Rey, under Colonel  Cooke and a Major Hunt.  This battalion was only enlisted for one  year, and the time for their discharge was approaching, and it was  generally understood that the majority of the men wanted to be  discharged so as to join the Mormons who had halted at Salt Lake,  but a lieutenant and about forty men volunteered to return to  Missouri as the escort of General Kearney.  These were mounted on  mules and horses, and I was appointed to conduct them to Monterey  by land.  Leaving the party at Los Angeles to follow by sea in the  Lexington, I started with the Mormon detachment and traveled by  land.  We averaged about thirty miles a day, stopped one day at  Santa Barbara, where I saw Colonel Burton, and so on by the usually  traveled road to Monterey, reaching it in about fifteen days,  arriving some days in advance of the Lexington.  This gave me the  best kind of an opportunity for seeing the country, which was very  sparsely populated indeed, except by a few families at the various  Missions.  We had no wheeled vehicles, but packed our food and  clothing on mules driven ahead, and we slept on the ground in the  open air, the rainy season having passed.  Fremont followed me by  land in a few days, and, by the end of May, General Kearney was all  ready at Monterey to take his departure, leaving to succeed him in  command Colonel R. B. Mason, First Dragoons.  Our Captain  (Tompkins), too, had become discontented at his separation from his  family, tendered his resignation to General Kearney, and availed  himself of a sailing-vessel bound for Callao to reach the East.  Colonel Mason selected me as his adjutant-general; and on the very  last day of May General Kearney, with his Mormon escort, with  Colonel Cooke, Colonel Swords (quartermaster), Captain Turner, and  a naval officer, Captain Radford, took his departure for the East  overland, leaving us in full"]]]
