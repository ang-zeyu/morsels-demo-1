At the end of  the day I shall pick out some of those who are quickest and most  attentive, and make of them officers under me. They will have more  work to do, for they will have to understand and teach my orders,  but also they will gain more honour and credit.\"    For hours the drill went on; then they broke off for dinner and  again worked until evening, and by that time had made sufficient  progress in their simple movements to begin to feel that there  was after all something more in it than they had fancied. For the  first hour it had seemed to them a sort of joke--a mere freak on  the part of their young chief; but they were themselves surprised  to find by the end of the day how rapidly they were able to change  from their rank two deep into the solid formation, and how their  spears rose and fell together at the order. Beric bade them by  the next morning provide themselves with spears six feet longer.  Britons were more accustomed to fight with javelin than with spear,  and the latter weapons were shorter and lighter than those of the  Romans. Beric felt that the advantage should be the other way, for  the small shields carried by the Britons were inferior as defensive  weapons to those of the Romans, and to preserve the balance it was  necessary therefore to have longer spears; the more so since the  Britons were taller, and far more powerful men than their foes,  and should therefore be able, with practice, to use longer weapons.    The next day Beric chose Boduoc as his second in command, and appointed  ten men sub-officers or sergeants. After a week of almost incessant  work that would have exhausted men less hardy and vigorous, Beric  was satisfied. The company had now come to take great interest in  their work, and were able to go through their exercises with a fair  show of regularity. Even the older chiefs, who had at first shaken  their heads as they looked on, acknowledged that there was a great  deal to be gained from the exercises. Parta was delighted. It was  she who had foreseen the advantages that might be derived from  Beric's stay among the Romans, and she entered heartily into his  plans, ordering the men engaged to be fed from the produce of her  flocks and herds.    When the week was over two hundred more men were summoned, a sufficient  number of the brightest and most intelligent of the first company  being chosen as their sub-officers. Before the drill commenced,  however, the first company were put through their exercises in  order that the newcomers might see what was expected of them, and  how much could be done. This time several of the chiefs joined the  companies in order that they might learn the words of command and  be fitted to lead. This greatly encouraged Beric, who had foreseen  that while he himself could command a company, he could do nothing  towards controlling ten or fifteen companies unless these had each  officers of rank and influence enough to control them.    The exercises after the first company had been drilled were carried on  in the forest some miles away from the village, the men assembling  there and camping beneath the trees, so that no rumour of gatherings  or preparations for war should reach the Romans, although at present  these were not in a position to make any eruption from Camalodunum,  as the greater portion of the legionaries had marched with Suetonius.    Returning one day to Cardun with Boduoc, Beric was surprised to  hear loud cries of lamentation. The women were running about with  dishevelled hair and disordered garments. Fearful that something  might have happened to his mother, he hurried on to the hall. Parta  was sitting on the ground rocking herself to and fro in her grief,  while the women were assembled round her uttering cries of anguish.    \"What is the matter?\" Beric asked as he hurried forward. The bard  stepped forward to answer the question.    \"My son,\" he said, \"misfortune has fallen on the land. The gods  have hidden their faces and refused to fight for their children.  Woe and desolation have come upon us. The altars are thrown down  and the priests slaughtered.\"    \"Mona is taken!\" Beric exclaimed.    \"Yes, my son, Mona is taken. The Druid Boroc but an hour ago brought  the news. The Romans having reached the strait, constructed flat  bottomed boats, and in these approached the island, the horsemen  towing their horses behind them. There were assembled the women  of the Silures and the Druids from all parts of Britain, with  many fugitives who had fled for shelter to the island. The Druids  remained by their altars offering up human sacrifices, the men and  women assembled on the beach waving torches, hurling imprecations  upon the invaders, and imploring the gods to aid them and to crush  the impious foe. For a time the Romans paused in mid channel,  terrified at the spectacle, and the hopes of all that the gods  had paralysed their arms rose high; but, alas! the halt was but  temporary. Encouraging each other with shouts, they again advanced,  and, leaping from their boats, waded through the water and set foot  on the sacred soil.    \"What was there to do? The men were few, and though the women in  their despair rushed wildly at the enemy, it was all in vain; men  and women were alike slaughtered; and then, moving forward, they  advanced against the holy circle and slew the Druids upon the altars  of the gods they served, and yet the gods were silent. They saw,  they heard, but answered not; neither the clouds rained fire upon  the invaders nor the earth shook. Ah! my son, evil days have fallen  upon the land. What will be the end of them?\"    Throughout the length and breadth of Britain a thrill of horror was  felt at the news of the massacre of Druids at Mona, and everywhere  it was followed by a stern determination to prepare for battle to  clear the land of the Romans. The Druids went from tribe to tribe  and from village to village stirring up men's hearts; the women,  even more deeply excited than the men at the news of the calamity,  behaved as if possessed, many going about the country calling upon  the men to take up arms, and foretelling victory to the Britons  and destruction to the Romans; even in the streets of Camalodunum  at night their voices were heard crying out curses upon the Romans  and predicting the destruction of the city.    A week after the news came, Beric, in fulfilment of the promise  he had given to Berenice, paid another visit to Camalodunum. There  were no signs in its busy streets of uneasiness or fear. The new  propraetor Catus Decianus, who commanded in the absence of Suetonius,  was holding a sort of court there, and the bearing of the Romans  seemed even more arrogant and insolent than usual. The news of  the destruction of the Druids at Mona had by them been hailed as  a final and most crushing blow to the resistance of the Britons.  Since their gods could not protect their own altars what hope  could there be for them in the future? Decianus, a haughty tyrant  who had been sent to Britain by Nero as a mark of signal favour,  in order that he might enrich himself by the spoils of the Britons,  was levying exactions at a rate hitherto unknown, treating the  people as if they were but dirt under his feet. His lieutenants,  all creatures of Nero, followed his example, and the exasperation  of the unfortunate Trinobantes, who were the chief victims, had  reached such a point that they were ready for revolt whensoever  the signal might come.    On arrival at the house of Caius Muro, Beric found Berenice at home;  she received him with joy. \"I am glad that you have come, Beric;  it is so dull now that father has gone away to the war. I have been  expecting you here for the last fortnight. I suppose you have been  amusing yourself too much to give a thought to me.\"    \"I have been very busy, Berenice. I am a chief now, and have had  much to do in the tribe. Among other things we have been having  great war with the wolves.\"    \"Yes, you told me when you were last here that you were going to  set out next day on an expedition against them.\"    \"They began first, as it turned out,\" he said smiling, \"and very  nearly made a meal of me that night on my way homeward.\"    \"Sit down and tell me all about it,\" she said. \"You know I love  stories.\"    Beric recited to her the story of the fight at the hut.    \"And there was a woman there! How terrible it must have been for  her to be alone with her children before you arrived, and to think  of her killing wolves with the spear. How different your women must  be from us, Beric, for we are only taught to embroider, to dress  ourselves, and to care for pretty things. Why, I should be frightened  out of my life at the sight of a wolf if I were all alone and had  no one to protect me.\"    \"Our women are brought up differently, Berenice. We regard them as  altogether our equals, and many of our tribes are ruled by women.  My own, you know, for example. They do not go into battle with the  men; but when a camp is attacked they are ready to fight in its  defence, and being brought up to lead a vigorous life, they are well  nigh as strong as we are. Among all the Gaulish nations the women  are held in high respect. Of course with you this is so sometimes.  Your father was wont to listen to the opinions of your mother; but  you know that is not often so, and that with many Romans women are  looked upon as inferior creatures, good only for dress and pleasure,  useful in ordering a house and in managing the slaves, but unfit  to take part in public life, and knowing nothing of aught save  domestic affairs. And what has been going on here, Berenice?\"    \"Nothing,\" the girl said; \"at least I have been doing nothing. I  went to the footraces the other day, and saw the propraetor, but  I don't like him. I think that he is a bad man, and I hear stories  among the ladies of his being cruel and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7050"],[0,"The Swoop! or, How Clarence Saved England: A Tale of the Great Invasion (#11)"],[1,"ckey-sticks. One rush and the battle was over. Your entire army, like  yourself, are prisoners.\"    \"The diggids they are!\" said the Prince blankly.    \"England, my England!\" cried Clarence, his face shining with a holy  patriotism. \"England, thou art free! Thou hast risen from the ashes of  the dead self. Let the nations learn from this that it is when  apparently crushed that the Briton is to more than ever be feared.\"    \"Thad's bad grabbar,\" said the Prince critically.    \"It isn't,\" said Clarence with warmth.    \"It _is_, I tell you. Id's a splid idfididive.\"    Clarence's eyes flashed fire.    \"I don't want any of your beastly cheek,\" he said. \"Scout-Master  Wagstaff, remove your prisoner.\"    \"All the sabe,\" said the Prince, \"id _is_ a splid idfididive.\"    Clarence pointed silently to the door.    \"And you doe id is,\" persisted the Prince. \"And id's spoiled your big  sbeech. Id--\"    \"Come on, can't you,\" interrupted Scout-Master Wagstaff.    \"I _ab_ cubbing, aren't I? I was odly saying--\"    \"I'll give you such a whack over the shin with this hockey-stick in a  minute!\" said the Scout-Master warningly. \"Come _on_!\"    The Prince went.          Chapter 11    CLARENCE--THE LAST PHASE      The brilliantly-lighted auditorium of the Palace Theatre.    Everywhere a murmur and stir. The orchestra is playing a selection. In  the stalls fair women and brave men converse in excited whispers. One  catches sentences here and there.    \"Quite a boy, I believe!\"    \"How perfectly sweet!\"    \"'Pon honour, Lady Gussie, I couldn't say. Bertie Bertison, of the  Bachelors', says a feller told him it was a clear thousand.\"    \"Do you hear that? Mr. Bertison says that this boy is getting a  thousand a week.\"    \"Why, that's more than either of those horrid generals got.\"    \"It's a lot of money, isn't it?\"    \"Of course, he did save the country, didn't he?\"    \"You may depend they wouldn't give it him if he wasn't worth it.\"    \"Met him last night at the Duchess's hop. Seems a decent little chap.  No side and that, if you know what I mean. Hullo, there's his number!\"    The orchestra stops. The number 7 is displayed. A burst of applause,  swelling into a roar as the curtain rises.    A stout man in crinkled evening-dress walks on to the stage.    \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he says, \"I 'ave the 'onour to-night to  introduce to you one whose name is, as the saying goes, a nouse'old  word. It is thanks to 'im, to this 'ero whom I 'ave the 'onour to  introduce to you to-night, that our beloved England no longer writhes  beneath the ruthless 'eel of the alien oppressor. It was this 'ero's  genius--and, I may say--er--I may say genius--that, unaided, 'it upon  the only way for removing the cruel conqueror from our beloved 'earths  and 'omes. It was this 'ero who, 'aving first allowed the invaders to  claw each other to 'ash (if I may be permitted the expression) after  the well-known precedent of the Kilkenny cats, thereupon firmly and  without flinching, stepped bravely in with his fellow-'eros--need I say  I allude to our gallant Boy Scouts?--and dexterously gave what-for in  no uncertain manner to the few survivors who remained.\"    Here the orator bowed, and took advantage of the applause to replenish  his stock of breath. When his face had begun to lose the purple tinge,  he raised his hand.    \"I 'ave only to add,\" he resumed, \"that this 'ero is engaged  exclusively by the management of the Palace Theatre of Varieties, at a  figure previously undreamed of in the annals of the music-hall stage.  He is in receipt of the magnificent weekly salary of no less than one  thousand one 'undred and fifty pounds a week.\"    Thunderous applause.    \"I 'ave little more to add. This 'ero will first perform a few of those  physical exercises which have made our Boy Scouts what they are, such  as deep breathing, twisting the right leg firmly round the neck, and  hopping on one foot across the stage. He will then give an exhibition  of the various calls and cries of the Boy Scouts--all, as you doubtless  know, skilful imitations of real living animals. In this connection I  'ave to assure you that he 'as nothing whatsoever in 'is mouth, as it  'as been sometimes suggested. In conclusion he will deliver a short  address on the subject of 'is great exploits. Ladies and gentlemen, I  have finished, and it only now remains for me to retire, 'aving duly  announced to you England's Darling Son, the Country's 'Ero, the  Nation's Proudest Possession--Clarence Chugwater.\"    A moment's breathless suspense, a crash from the orchestra, and the  audience are standing on their seats, cheering, shouting, stamping.    A small sturdy, spectacled figure is on the stage.    It is Clarence, the Boy of Destiny."]]]
