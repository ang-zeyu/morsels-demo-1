The old gentleman certainly had that  illusion strongly impressed on his mind when he so sapiently spoke of  my firing at a shadow.\"    \"But the gate,\" interrupted Charles de Haldimar, with something of mild  reproach in his tones,--\"you forget, Valletort, the gate was found  unlocked, and that my brother is missing. HE, at least, was flesh and  blood, as you say, and yet he has disappeared. What more probable,  therefore, than that this stranger is at once the cause and the agent  of his abduction?\"    \"Impossible, Charles,\" observed Captain Blessington; \"Frederick was in  the midst of his guard. How, therefore, could he be conveyed away  without the alarm being given? Numbers only could have succeeded in so  desperate an enterprise; and yet there is no evidence, or even  suspicion, of more than one individual having been here.\"    \"It is a singular affair altogether,\" returned Sir Everard, musingly.  \"Of two things, however, I am satisfied. The first is, that the  stranger, whoever he may be, and if he really has been here, is no  Indian; the second, that he is personally known to the governor, who  has been, or I mistake much, more alarmed at his individual presence  than if Ponteac and his whole band had suddenly broken in upon us. Did  you remark his emotion, when I dwelt on the peculiar character of  personal triumph and revenge which the cry of the lurking villain  outside seemed to express? and did you notice the eagerness with which  he enquired if I thought I had hit him? Depend upon it, there is more  in all this than is dreamt of in our philosophy.\"    \"And it was your undisguised perception of that emotion,\" remarked  Captain Blessington, \"that drew down his severity upon your own head.  It was, however, too palpable not to be noticed by all; and I dare say  conjecture is as busily and as vaguely at work among our companions as  it is with us. The clue to the mystery, in a great degree, now dwells  with Frank Halloway; and to him we must look for its elucidation. His  disclosure will be one, I apprehend, full of ignominy to himself, but  of the highest interest and importance to us all. And yet I know not  how to believe the man the traitor he appears.\"    \"Did you remark that last harrowing exclamation of his wife?\" observed  Charles de Haldimar, in a tone of unspeakable melancholy. \"How  fearfully prophetic it sounded in my ears. I know not how it is,\" he  pursued, \"but I wish I had not heard those sounds; for since that  moment I have had a sad strange presentiment of evil at my heart.  Heaven grant my poor brother may make his appearance, as I still trust  he will, at the hour Halloway seems to expect, for if not, the latter  most assuredly dies. I know my father well; and, if convicted by a  court martial, no human power can alter the destiny that awaits Frank  Halloway.\"    \"Rally, my dear Charles, rally,\" said Sir Everard, affecting a  confidence he did not feel himself; \"indulge not in these idle and  superstitious fancies. I pity Halloway from my soul, and feel the  deepest interest in his pretty and unhappy wife; but that is no reason  why one should attach importance to the incoherent expressions wrung  from her in the agony of grief.\"    \"It is kind of you, Valletort, to endeavour to cheer my spirits, when,  if the truth were confessed, you acknowledge the influence of the same  feelings. I thank you for the attempt, but time alone can show how far  I shall have reason, or otherwise, to lament the occurrences of this  night.\"    They had now reached that part of the ramparts whence the shot from Sir  Everard's rifle had been fired. Several men were occupied in digging a  grave in the precise spot on which the unfortunate Murphy had stood  when he received his death-wound; and into this, when completed, the  body, enshrouded in the cloak already alluded to, was deposited by his  companions.          CHAPTER IV.    While the adjutant was yet reading, in a low and solemn voice, the  service for the dead, a fierce and distant yell, as if from a legion of  devils, burst suddenly from the forest, and brought the hands of the  startled officers instinctively to their swords. This appalling cry  lasted, without interruption, for many minutes, and was then as  abruptly checked as it had been unexpectedly delivered. A considerable  pause succeeded, and then again it rose with even more startling  vehemence than before. By one unaccustomed to those devilish sounds, no  distinction could have been made in the two several yells that had been  thus savagely pealed forth; but those to whom practice and long  experience in the warlike habits and customs of the Indians had  rendered their shouts familiar, at once divined, or fancied they  divined, the cause. The first was, to their conception, a yell  expressive at once of vengeance and disappointment in pursuit,--perhaps  of some prisoner who had escaped from their toils; the second, of  triumph and success,--in all probability, indicative of the recapture  of that prisoner. For many minutes afterwards the officers continued to  listen, with the most aching attention, for a repetition of the cry, or  even fainter sounds, that might denote either a nearer approach to the  fort, or the final departure of the Indians. After the second yell,  however, the woods, in the heart of which it appeared to have been  uttered, were buried in as profound a silence as if they had never yet  echoed back the voice of man; and all at length became satisfied that  the Indians, having accomplished some particular purpose, had retired  once more to their distant encampments for the night. Captain Erskine  was the first who broke the almost breathless silence that prevailed  among themselves.    \"On my life De Haldimar is a prisoner with the Indians. He has been  attempting his escape,--has been detected,--followed, and again fallen  into their hands. I know their infernal yells but too well. The last  expressed their savage joy at the capture of a prisoner; and there is  no one of us missing but De Haldimar.\"    \"Not a doubt of it,\" said Captain Blessington; \"the cry was certainly  what you describe it, and Heaven only knows what will be the fate of  our poor friend.\"    No other officer spoke, for all were oppressed by the weight of their  own feelings, and sought rather to give indulgence to speculation in  secret, than to share their impressions with their companions. Charles  de Haldimar stood a little in the rear, leaning his head upon his hand  against the box of the sentry, (who was silently, though anxiously,  pacing his walk,) and in an attitude expressive of the deepest  dejection and sorrow.    \"I suppose I must finish Lawson's work, although I am but a poor hand  at this sort of thing,\" resumed Captain Erskine, taking up the prayer  book the adjutant had, in hastening on the first alarm to get the men  under arms, carelessly thrown on the grave of the now unconscious  Murphy.    He then commenced the service at the point where Mr. Lawson had so  abruptly broken off, and went through the remainder of the prayers. A  very few minutes sufficed for the performance of this solemn duty,  which was effected by the faint dim light of the at length dawning day,  and the men in attendance proceeded to fill up the grave of their  officer.    Gradually the mists, that had fallen during the latter hours of the  night, began to ascend from the common, and disperse themselves in air,  conveying the appearance of a rolling sheet of vapour retiring Back  upon itself, and disclosing objects in succession, until the eye could  embrace all that came within its extent of vision. As the officers yet  lingered near the rude grave of their companion, watching with  abstracted air the languid and almost mechanical action of their jaded  men, as they emptied shovel after shovel of the damp earth over the  body of its new tenant, they were suddenly startled by an expression of  exultation from Sir Everard Valletort.    \"By Jupiter, I have pinked him,\" he exclaimed triumphantly. \"I knew my  rifle could not err; and as for my sight, I have carried away too many  prizes in target-shooting to have been deceived in that. How delighted  the old governor will be, Charles, to hear this. No more lecturing, I  am sure, for the next six months at least;\" and the young officer  rubbed his hands together, at the success of his shot, with as much  satisfaction and unconcern for the future, as if he had been in his own  native England; in the midst of a prize-ring.    Roused by the observation of his friend, De Haldimar quitted his  position near the sentry box, and advanced to the outer edge of the  rampart. To him, as to his companions, the outline of the old bomb  proof was now distinctly visible, but it was sometime before they could  discover, in the direction in which Valletort pointed, a dark speck  upon the common; and this so indistinctly, they could scarcely  distinguish it with the naked eye.    \"Your sight is quite equal to your aim, Sir Everard,\" remarked  Lieutenant Johnstone, one of Erskine's subalterns, \"and both are  decidedly superior to mine; yet I used to be thought a good rifleman  too, and have credit for an eye no less keen than that of an Indian.  You have the advantage of me, however; for I honestly admit I never  could have picked off yon fellow in the dark as you have done.\"    As the dawn increased, the dark shadow of a human form, stretched at  its length upon the ground, became perceptible; and the officers, with  one unanimous voice, bore loud testimony to the skill and dexterity of  him who had, under such extreme disadvantages, accomplished the death  of their skulking enemy.    \"Bravo, Valletort,\" said Charles de Haldimar, recovering his spirits,  as much from the idea, now occurring to him, that this might indeed be  the stranger whose appearance had so greatly disturbed his father, as  from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49131"],[0,"Wings over England (#11)"],[1,"eased.    Only now and then did she sleep with some working girls in the subway.  Most nights after the \"all clear\" had sounded, she sped away to creep  beneath downy covers in a wing of Lady Perkins' mammoth old home.    \"It's not that I crave magnificence,\" she confided to Dave, \"It's just  that I must have rest. It--well, you see--it all must seem so simple and  easy, my singing. And it truly is, but,\"--she heaved a sigh--\"when it's  all over, I'm a rag.\"    \"I know,\" Dave agreed. \"It's always that way. The thing you do with  apparent ease because you have yourself under perfect carefree control,  is just the thing that takes it out of you.\"    By himself later, Dave recalled words of a great old poem:      \"If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,    And walk with kings, nor lose the common touch,--\"    \"That,\" he told himself, \"is just what Cherry can do. And nothing can  ever spoil her.\"    If he had quoted from that same poem:      \"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster    And treat those two impostors just the same,--\"    he would have been telling Cherry's fortune, for Cherry was to meet with  both Triumph and Disaster.                                       _Chapter_ XII                            \"The House Is Gone\"      It happened, or shall we say began, on a Sunday night. During the many  days previous to this, things had picked up little by little in Cherry's  subway radio studio. One evening the little Irish girl who played the  piano had brought in a young fellow with a shabby violin case under his  arm. \"Can you play it?\" Cherry asked.    \"A little,\" was the modest reply.    The young fellow, who had gone through all the horrors of the Battle of  Flanders and Dunkirk, was Scotch. He could do weird things with that  violin. With it alone he could make you believe that a score or more of  bagpipers were marching down the street. And when it came to that mellow  old Scotch song:      \"Flow gently, Sweet Afton    Among thy green braes    Flow gently. I'll sing thee    A song in thy praise.\"    he could bring a happy tear to many a tired eye. So he was given a place  on the program, and weary Cherry sang a little less than before.    Other musicians wandered in. Where they all came from no one will ever  know. Next there came a cellist, then a drummer, two bass viols, two  clarinets, two more violins, a gypsy girl with tambourine and  castanets,--all these and half a dozen others wandered in. After that  they had an orchestra. There was not an \"artist\" in the hard and fast  meaning of the word among them all, but they could roll the barrel, set  Johnny loving, swing the chariot low, roll the old chariot along, and do  a hundred other songs dear to the hearts of the good common people of  old England and to many another who did not consider himself quite so  common.    All this gave Cherry a breathing spell now and then. But when the  members of the orchestra had each done his bit for just so long, there  would come calls from all down the subway:    \"Cherry! Cherry! We want Cherry! We want the Singin' Angel.\"    The Singin' Angel, that is what they came at last to call her. That was  because of Sunday nights, for on that night they left the Old Chariot at  home, put lovin' Johnny to bed early, rolled the barrel far back in the  corner, and pushed \"The Old Rugged Cross\" right out in front.    No one seemed to mind. Indeed they appeared to love that hour of the  week best of all. In times such as this people cling to their religion.  One moment \"Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me\" would go rolling on and on from  end to end of the subway.    Some one in the orchestra would start \"Throw Out The Lifeline to danger  frought men.\"    Then Cherry in her strong young voice would sing:      \"When all my trials and troubles are o'er    And I am safe on that beautiful shore      That will be glory, be glory for me.\"    \"Now!\" she would cry. \"Everybody sing!\"      \"Oh! That will be glory for me,    Glory for me, glory for me.\"    Yes, religion seemed very real on these Sunday nights. On this  particular night, it was midnight when Cherry reached Lady Perkins'  home. She remembered it afterward, for at that very moment Big Ben was  gloriously booming the hour of twelve.    She had walked home alone. It was not far. She let herself in with her  latchkey. The \"all clear\" had sounded, so, feeling weary and happy all  in one, she stretched out on her bed fully dressed, and fell asleep.    She was dreaming of quiet, sleepy hours, with Flash at her side, while  her sheep wandered over the hillside at Ramsey Farm, when suddenly it  seemed that a mighty thunderstorm had stolen upon her unawares and that  the very hill was being rocked by its roaring.    She awoke standing in the center of the room. Her knees trembled so she  could scarcely stand. The floor beneath her vibrated like a ship in a  storm. From all about her came strange crashes like walls falling one  upon another.    She tried to call, but could only whisper. A narrow crack of light  appeared before her. A board in the door had been split. She stepped to  the door and opened it. Then, catching herself, she started back to  whisper in dismay:    \"It's gone! The house is gone! Only my room is here!\"    That was not quite true. Of that spacious home only three rooms  remained--her own and two others. A half-ton bomb had scattered the  rest.    Recalling that the French windows of her room opened out on a court, she  sprang to the nearest one. Then she was out and away.    A weird light from a flare sent down by the enemy illuminated the  street. Once on that street she began to run. In all her fright and  confusion she had a vague plan. Dave was spending the night with his  uncle. She knew the address. Was it far? She did not know. All she knew  was that somehow she must get there.    She had gone but a block when she ran squarely into the arms of a  six-foot policeman.    \"Here now, Miss! What's this?\" His voice had a kindly rumble.    \"The house!\" she cried. \"Lady Perkins' house! It's gone!\"    \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"It was a terrible bomb. The firemen are just there  now. Thank God Lady Perkins and all were away.\"    \"No!\" Cherry whispered. \"I was there.\"    \"You?\" The Bobby looked her over. \"You were there? And who now might you  be?\"    \"I--I'm Cherry.\"    \"What? The Singin' Angel?\" He looked her in the face. \"Bless me heart it  is now! What do you know about that! Bless the Lord you are safe.\"    \"I can't talk.\" The girl's head drooped. \"I can't sing. I--I want to go  to Dave's Uncle's place.\" In her fright she was like a child.    \"And where would that be?\"    She gave him the address. He read it, then blew a whistle. A man  appeared.    \"Jim,\" he said, \"this is Cherry, the Singin' Angel. God's own child she  is.\"    \"The Singin' Angel!\" Jim's jaw dropped.    \"None other,\" said the Bobby. \"An' you're to take her to this address.  Mind you drive careful, careful and steady as ye would if it were the  Christ Child you're 'avin in yer car.\"    Jim's car was old and dilapidated, but to Cherry it was the latest model  of a Rolls Royce and its cushions as soft as down, for was it not taking  her to her friends?    Arrived at the house, in the presence of Dave's tall, gray-haired uncle,  she disgraced herself by throwing herself in Dave's arms. Then she wept  like a child.    This storm over, she felt better. Two cups of strong tea revived her  spirits but not her voice. She could only whisper as she said: \"Dave,  please take me home, back to the farm.\"    \"At this hour of the night?\" Dave stared.    \"I'll have a car for you at once,\" said the kindly gray-haired uncle.  \"Dave, my boy, London's no place for a girl who has gone through what  this girl has tonight.\"    All the way home Dave had an arm about Cherry. She cuddled close to him,  as a scared child would and they were not ashamed.    Arrived at the farm, they quietly dismissed the driver. Arousing no one,  they sat before the half-burned-out kitchen fire for a time. When at  last Dave felt the trembling quiver of her shoulders pass away, he said  huskily:    \"You'd better turn in for a little sleep.\"    \"Dave,\" she whispered. \"My voice is gone. I can't sing any more.\"    \"Fright. That's all.\" Dave tried to reassure her. \"It will come back.\"    Would it? He wondered as he watched her make her way slowly, dreamily,  like a sleep-walker, up the stairs.                                       _Chapter_ XIII                           Lull Before the Storm      Until one P. M. the next day Cherry was lost to the world. At last she  stirred beneath her rare old English blankets, opened her eyes, stared  about her, tried to remember, then began trying to forget.    In slippers and bathrobe she crept down to the kitchen where the cook  served her with very strong tea and a small, delicious meat pie. After  that she curled up in the big chair before the fire and once again fell  asleep.    It was only on the morning of the second day that she found courage to  face life as it was. The home in London in which she had been given  royal welcome was gone. She could barely whisper. Would her voice come  back? What of her people there in the subway? The little Irish girl, the  Scotch fiddler, and all the rest, were they carrying on?    \"Yes,\" she assured herself as a fresh glow of hope overflowed her being,  \"They are right there doing their bit.\"    Breakfast over, with Flash at her heels, she once again led her small  flock of sheep out to the frostbitten, sunlit pasture. There, after  spreading a blanket on a rock, she lay for a long time staring up at the  sun. It seemed to her, at that moment, that all that terrible war was  but a bad dream, that it never had happened, that all the world was as  much at peace as was her sunny pasture.    The drone of airplane motors, followed by machine-guns tearing at the  sky drove this illusion from her mind. The war was real, terribly real.  It must be faced with eyes open "]]]
