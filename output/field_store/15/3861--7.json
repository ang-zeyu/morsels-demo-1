The ambassadors of the Swedish kings were received  with the utmost deference in every court. Her soldiers won great  battles and ended mighty wars. The England of Cromwell and Charles II.  was unimportant and isolated in comparison with this northern kingdom,  which could pour forth armies of gigantic blond warriors, headed by  generals astute as well as brave.    It was no small matter, then, in 1626, that the loyal Swedes were  hoping that their queen would give birth to a male heir to succeed his  splendid father, Gustavus Adolphus, ranked by military historians as  one of the six great generals whom the world had so far produced. The  queen, a German princess of Brandenburg, had already borne two  daughters, who died in infancy. The expectation was wide-spread and  intense that she should now become the mother of a son; and the king  himself was no less anxious.    When the event occurred, the child was seen to be completely covered  with hair, and for this reason the attendants at first believed that it  was the desired boy. When their mistake was discovered they were afraid  to tell the king, who was waiting in his study for the announcement to  be made. At last, when no one else would go to him, his sister, the  Princess Caroline, volunteered to break the news.    Gustavus was in truth a chivalrous, high-bred monarch. Though he must  have been disappointed at the advent of a daughter, he showed no sign  of dissatisfaction or even of surprise; but, rising, he embraced his  sister, saying:    \"Let us thank God. I hope this girl will be as good as a boy to me. May  God preserve her now that He has sent her!\"    It is customary at almost all courts to pay less attention to the birth  of a princess than to that of a prince; but Gustavus displayed his  chivalry toward this little daughter, whom he named Christina. He  ordered that the full royal salute should be fired in every fortress of  his kingdom and that displays of fireworks, balls of honor, and court  functions should take place; \"for,\" as he said, \"this is the heir to my  throne.\" And so from the first he took his child under his own keeping  and treated her as if she were a much-loved son as well as a successor.    He joked about her looks when she was born, when she was mistaken for a  boy.    \"She will be clever,\" he said, \"for she has taken us all in!\"    The Swedish people were as delighted with their little princess as were  the people of Holland when the present Queen Wilhelmina was born, to  carry on the succession of the House of Orange. On one occasion the  king and the small Christina, who were inseparable companions, happened  to approach a fortress where they expected to spend the night. The  commander of the castle was bound to fire a royal salute of fifty  cannon in honor of his sovereign; yet he dreaded the effect upon the  princess of such a roaring and bellowing of artillery. He therefore  sent a swift horseman to meet the royal party at a distance and explain  his perplexity. Should he fire these guns or not? Would the king give  an order?    Gustavus thought for a moment, and then replied:    \"My daughter is the daughter of a soldier, and she must learn to lead a  soldier's life. Let the guns be fired!\"    The procession moved on. Presently fire spurted from the embrasures of  the fort, and its batteries thundered in one great roar. The king  looked down at Christina. Her face was aglow with pleasure and  excitement; she clapped her hands and laughed, and cried out:    \"More bang! More! More! More!\"    This is only one of a score of stories that were circulated about the  princess, and the Swedes were more and more delighted with the girl who  was to be their queen.    Somewhat curiously, Christina's mother, Queen Maria, cared little for  the child, and, in fact, came at last to detest her almost as much as  the king loved her. It is hard to explain this dislike. Perhaps she had  a morbid desire for a son and begrudged the honors given to a daughter.  Perhaps she was a little jealous of her own child, who took so much of  the king's attention. Afterward, in writing of her mother, Christina  excuses her, and says quite frankly:    She could not bear to see me, because I was a girl, and an ugly girl at  that. And she was right enough, for I was as tawny as a little Turk.    This candid description of herself is hardly just. Christina was never  beautiful, and she had a harsh voice. She was apt to be overbearing  even as a little girl. Yet she was a most interesting child, with an  expressive face, large eyes, an aquiline nose, and the blond hair of  her people. There was nothing in this to account for her mother's  intense dislike for her.    It was currently reported at the time that attempts were made to maim  or seriously injure the little princess. By what was made to seem an  accident, she would be dropped upon the floor, and heavy articles of  furniture would somehow manage to strike her. More than once a great  beam fell mysteriously close to her, either in the palace or while she  was passing through the streets. None of these things did her serious  harm, however. Most of them she luckily escaped; but when she had grown  to be a woman one of her shoulders was permanently higher than the  other.    \"I suppose,\" said Christina, \"that I could be straightened if I would  let the surgeons attend to it; but it isn't worth while to take the  trouble.\"    When Christina was four, Sweden became involved in the great war that  had been raging for a dozen years between the Protestant and the  Catholic states of Germany. Gradually the neighboring powers had been  drawn into the struggle, either to serve their own ends or to support  the faith to which they adhered. Gustavus Adolphus took up the sword  with mixed motives, for he was full of enthusiasm for the imperiled  cause of the Reformation, and at the same time he deemed it a favorable  opportunity to assert his control over the shores of the Baltic.    The warrior king summoned his army and prepared to invade Germany.  Before departing he took his little daughter by the hand and led her  among the assembled nobles and councilors of state. To them he  intrusted the princess, making them kneel and vow that they would  regard her as his heir, and, if aught should happen to him, as his  successor. Amid the clashing of swords and the clang of armor this vow  was taken, and the king went forth to war.    He met the ablest generals of his enemies, and the fortunes of battle  swayed hither and thither; but the climax came when his soldiers  encountered those of Wallenstein--that strange, overbearing, arrogant,  mysterious creature whom many regarded with a sort of awe. The clash  came at Lutzen, in Saxony. The Swedish king fought long and hard, and  so did his mighty opponent; but at last, in the very midst of a  tremendous onset that swept all before him, Gustavus received a mortal  wound and died, even while Wallenstein was fleeing from the field of  battle.    The battle of Lutzen made Christina Queen of Sweden at the age of six.  Of course, she could not yet be crowned, but a council of able  ministers continued the policy of the late king and taught the young  queen her first lessons in statecraft. Her intellect soon showed itself  as more than that of a child. She understood all that was taking place,  and all that was planned and arranged. Her tact was unusual. Her  discretion was admired by every one; and after a while she had the  advice and training of the great Swedish chancellor, Oxenstierna, whose  wisdom she shared to a remarkable degree.    Before she was sixteen she had so approved herself to her counselors,  and especially to the people at large, that there was a wide-spread  clamor that she should take the throne and govern in her own person. To  this she gave no heed, but said:    \"I am not yet ready.\"    All this time she bore herself like a king. There was nothing  distinctly feminine about her. She took but slight interest in her  appearance. She wore sword and armor in the presence of her troops, and  often she dressed entirely in men's clothes. She would take long,  lonely gallops through the forests, brooding over problems of state and  feeling no fatigue or fear. And indeed why should she fear, who was  beloved by all her subjects?    When her eighteenth year arrived, the demand for her coronation was  impossible to resist. All Sweden wished to see a ruling queen, who  might marry and have children to succeed her through the royal line of  her great father. Christina consented to be crowned, but she absolutely  refused all thought of marriage. She had more suitors from all parts of  Europe than even Elizabeth of England; but, unlike Elizabeth, she did  not dally with them, give them false hopes, or use them for the  political advantage of her kingdom.    At that time Sweden was stronger than England, and was so situated as  to be independent of alliances. So Christina said, in her harsh,  peremptory voice:    \"I shall never marry; and why should you speak of my having children! I  am just as likely to give birth to a Nero as to an Augustus.\"    Having assumed the throne, she ruled with a strictness of government  such as Sweden had not known before. She took the reins of state into  her own hands and carried out a foreign policy of her own, over the  heads of her ministers, and even against the wishes of her people. The  fighting upon the Continent had dragged out to a weary length, but the  Swedes, on the whole, had scored a marked advantage. For this reason  the war was popular, and every one wished it to go on; but Christina,  of her own will, decided that it must stop, that mere glory was not to  be considered against material advantages. Sweden had had enough of  glory; she must now look to her enrichment and prosperity through the  channels of peace.    Therefore, in 1648, against Oxenstierna, against her generals, and  against her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion.

QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN AND THE MARQUIS MONALDESCHI      Sweden to-day is one of the peaceful kingdoms of the world, whose people  are prosperous, well governed, and somewhat apart from the clash and  turmoil of other states and nations. Even the secession of Norway, a few  years ago, was accomplished without bloodshed, and now the two kingdoms  exist side by side as free from strife as they are with Denmark, which  once domineered and tyrannized over both.    It is difficult to believe that long ago, in the Middle Ages, the cities  of southern Sweden were among the great commercial centers of the world.  Stockholm and Lund ranked with London and Paris. They absorbed the  commerce of the northern seas, and were the admiration of thousands  of travelers and merchants who passed through them and trafficked with  them.    Much nearer to our own time, Sweden was the great military power of  northern Europe. The ambassadors of the Swedish kings were received with  the utmost deference in every court. Her soldiers won great battles  and ended mighty wars. The England of Cromwell and Charles II. was  unimportant and isolated in comparison with this northern kingdom, which  could pour forth armies of gigantic blond warriors, headed by generals  astute as well as brave.
