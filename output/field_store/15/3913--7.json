I should feel so much better if you would.\"    \"Oh, Stephen, don't say that!\" she exclaimed. \"God has given me no  greater happiness in this life than the sight of the gratitude of that  poor creature, Nancy. I shall never forget the old woman's joy at the  sight of her daughter. It made a palace out of that dingy furniture  shop. Hand me my handkerchief, dear.\"    Stephen noticed with a pang that the lace of it was frayed and torn at  the corner.    There was a knock at the door.    \"Come in,\" said Mrs. Brice, hastily putting the handkerchief down.    Hester stood on the threshold, and old Nancy beside her.    \"Evenin', Mis' Brice. De good Lawd bless you, lady, an' Miste' Brice,\"  said the old negress.    \"Well, Nancy?\"    Nancy pressed into the room. \"Mis' Brice!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Ain' you gwineter' low Hester an' me to wuk fo' you?\"    \"Indeed I should be glad to, Nancy. But we are boarding.\"    \"Yassm, yassm,\" said Nancy, and relapsed into awkward silence. Then  again, \"Mis' Brice!\"    \"Yes, Nancy?\"    \"Ef you 'lows us t' come heah an' straighten out you' close, an' mend  'em--you dunno how happy you mek me an' Hester--des to do dat much, Mis'  Brice.\"    The note of appeal was irresistible. Mrs. Brice rose and unlocked the  trunks.    \"You may unpack them, Nancy,\" she said.    With what alacrity did the old woman take off her black bonnet and  shawl! \"Whaffor you stannin' dere, Hester?\" she cried.    \"Hester is tired,\" said Mrs. Brice, compassionately, and tears came to  her eyes again at the thought of what they had both been through that  day.    \"Tired!\" said Nancy, holding up her hands. \"No'm, she ain' tired. She  des kinder stupefied by you' goodness, Mis' Brice.\"    A scene was saved by the appearance of Miss Crane's hired girl.    \"Mr. and Mrs. Cluyme, in the parlor, mum,\" she said.    If Mr. Jacob Cluyme sniffed a little as he was ushered into Miss Crane's  best parlor, it was perhaps because of she stuffy dampness of that room.  Mr. Cluyme was one of those persons the effusiveness of whose greeting  does not tally with the limpness of their grasp. He was attempting, when  Stephen appeared, to get a little heat into his hands by rubbing them,  as a man who kindles a stick of wood for a visitor. The gentleman had  red chop-whiskers,--to continue to put his worst side foremost, which  demanded a ruddy face. He welcomed Stephen to St. Louis with neighborly  effusion; while his wife, a round little woman, bubbled over to Mrs.  Brice.    \"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Cluyme, \"I used often to go to Boston in the  forties. In fact--ahem--I may claim to be a New Englander. Alas, no, I  never met your father. But when I heard of the sad circumstances of his  death, I felt as if I had lost a personal friend. His probity, sir, and  his religious principles were an honor to the Athens of America. I have  listened to my friend, Mr. Atterbury,--Mr. Samuel Atterbury,--eulogize  him by the hour.\"    Stephen was surprised.    \"Why, yes,\" said he, \"Mr. Atterbury was a friend.\"    \"Of course,\" said Mr. Cluyme, \"I knew it. Four years ago, the last  business trip I made to Boston, I met Atterbury on the street. Absence  makes no difference to some men, sir, nor the West, for that matter.  They never change. Atterbury nearly took me in his arms. 'My dear  fellow,' he cried, 'how long are you to be in town?' I was going the  next day. 'Sorry I can't ask you to dinner,' says he, but step into the  Tremont House and have a bite.'--Wasn't that like Atterbury?\"    Stephen thought it was. But Mr. Cluyme was evidently expecting no  answer.    \"Well,\" said he, \"what I was going to say was that we heard you were in  town; 'Friends of Samuel Atterbury, my dear,' I said to my wife. We are  neighbors, Mr. Brace. You must know the girls. You must come to supper.  We live very plainly, sir, very simply. I am afraid that you will miss  the luxury of the East, and some of the refinement, Stephen. I hope I  may call you so, my boy. We have a few cultured citizens, Stephen, but  all are not so. I miss the atmosphere. I seemed to live again when I  got to Boston. But business, sir,--the making of money is a sordid  occupation. You will come to supper?\"    \"I scarcely think that my mother will go out,\" said Stephen.    \"Oh, be friends! It will cheer her. Not a dinner-party, my boy, only  a plain, comfortable meal, with plenty to eat. Of course she will. Of  course she will. Not a Boston social function, you understand. Boston,  Stephen, I have always looked upon as the centre of the universe. Our  universe, I mean. America for Americans is a motto of mine. Oh, no,\" he  added quickly, \"I don't mean a Know Nothing. Religious freedom, my boy,  is part of our great Constitution. By the way, Stephen--Atterbury always  had such a respect for your father's opinions--\"    \"My father was not an Abolitionist, sir,\" said Stephen, smiling.    \"Quite right, quite right,\" said Mr. Cluyme.    \"But I am not sure, since I have come here, that I have not some  sympathy and respect for the Abolitionists.\"    Mr. Cluyme gave a perceptible start. He glanced at the heavy hangings on  the windows and then out of the open door into the hall. For a space his  wife's chatter to Mrs. Brace, on Boston fashions, filled the room.    \"My dear Stephen,\" said the gentleman, dropping his voice, \"that is all  very well in Boston. But take a little advice from one who is old enough  to counsel you. You are young, and you must learn to temper yourself to  the tone of the place which you have made your home. St. Louis is full  of excellent people, but they are not precisely Abolitionists. We are  gathering, it is true, a small party who are for gradual emancipation.  But our New England population here is small yet compared to the  Southerners. And they are very violent, sir.\"    Stephen could not resist saying, \"Judge Whipple does not seem to have  tempered himself, sir.\"    \"Silas Whipple is a fanatic, sir,\" cried Mr. Cluyme.    \"His hand is against every man's. He denounces Douglas on the slightest  excuse, and would go to Washington when Congress opens to fight with  Stephens and Toombs and Davis. But what good does it do him? He might  have been in the Senate, or on the Supreme Bench, had he not stirred up  so much hatred. And yet I can't help liking Whipple. Do you know him?\"    A resounding ring of the door-bell cut off Stephen's reply, and Mrs.  Cluyme's small talk to Mrs. Brice. In the hall rumbled a familiar voice,  and in stalked none other than Judge Whipple himself. Without noticing  the other occupants of the parlor he strode up to Mrs. Brice, looked at  her for an instant from under the grizzled brows, and held out his large  hand.    \"Pray, ma'am,\" he said, \"what have you done with your slave?\"    Mrs. Cluyme emitted a muffled shriek, like that of a person frightened  in a dream. Her husband grasped the curved back of his chair. But  Stephen smiled. And his mother smiled a little, too.    \"Are you Mr. Whipple?\" she asked.    \"I am, madam,\" was the reply.    \"My slave is upstairs, I believe, unpacking my trunks,\" said Mrs. Brice.    Mr. and Mrs. Cluyme exchanged a glance of consternation. Then Mrs.  Cluyme sat down again, rather heavily, as though her legs had refused to  hold her.    \"Well, well, ma'am!\" The Judge looked again at Mrs. Brice, and a gleam  of mirth lighted the severity of his face. He was plainly pleased with  her--this serene lady in black, whose voice had the sweet ring of women  who are well born and whose manner was so self-contained. To speak  truth, the Judge was prepared to dislike her. He had never laid eyes  upon her, and as he walked hither from his house he seemed to foresee  a helpless little woman who, once he had called, would fling her Boston  pride to the winds and dump her woes upon him. He looked again, and  decidedly approved of Mrs. Brice, and was unaware that his glance  embarrassed her.    \"Mr. Whipple,\" she said,--\"do you know Mr. and Mrs. Cluyme?\"    The Judge looked behind him abruptly, nodded ferociously at Mr. Cluyme,  and took the hand that fluttered out to him from Mrs. Cluyme.    \"Know the Judge!\" exclaimed that lady, \"I reckon we do. And my Belle is  so fond of him. She thinks there is no one equal to Mr. Whipple. Judge,  you must come round to a family supper. Belle will surpass herself.\"    \"Umph!\" said the Judge, \"I think I like Edith best of your girls,  ma'am.\"    \"Edith is a good daughter, if I do say it myself,\" said Mrs. Cluyme. \"I  have tried to do right by my children.\" She was still greatly flustered,  and curiosity about the matter of the slave burned upon her face.  Neither the Judge nor Mrs. Brice were people one could catechise.  Stephen, scanning the Judge, was wondering how far he regarded the  matter as a joke.    \"Well, madam,\" said Mr. Whipple, as he seated himself on the other end  of the horsehair sofa, \"I'll warrant when you left Boston that you did  not expect to own a slave the day after you arrived in St. Louis.\"    \"But I do not own her,\" said Mrs. Brice. \"It is my son who owns her.\"    This was too much for Mr. Cluyme.    \"What!\" he cried to Stephen. \"You own a slave? You, a mere boy, have  bought a negress?\"    \"And what is more, sir, I approve of it,\" the Judge put in, severely. \"I  am going to take the young man into my office.\"    Mr. Cluyme gradually retired into the back of his chair, looking at  Mr. Whipple as though he expected him to touch a match to the window  curtains. But Mr. Cluyme was elastic.    \"Pardon me, Judge,\" said he, \"but I trust that I may be allowed to  congratulate you upon the abandonment of principles which I have  considered a clog to your career. They did you honor, sir, but they were  Quixotic. I, sir, am for saving our glorious Union at any cost. And we  have no right to deprive our brethren of their property of their very  means of livelihood.\"    The Judge grinned diabolically. Mrs. Cluyme was as yet too stunned to  speak. Only Stephen's mother"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#11)"],[1," at a pace so fast that its riders had hard  work to stick upon its back; so there was little further conversation until  they drew up beside the palace steps.    An aged Winkie, dressed in a uniform of silver cloth, came forward to assist  them to alight. Said the Scarecrow to his personage:    \"Show us at once to your master, the Emperor.\"    The man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way, and  finally answered:    \"I fear I must ask you to wait for a time. The Emperor is not receiving this  morning.\"        123    \"How is that?\" enquired the Scarecrow, anxiously.\" I hope nothing has  happened to him.\"    \"Oh, no; nothing serious,\" returned the man. \"But this is his Majesty's day  for being polished; and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with  putz-pomade.\"    \"Oh, I see!\" cried the Scarecrow, greatly reassured. \"My friend was ever  inclined to be a dandy, and I suppose he is now more proud than ever of his  personal appearance.\"    \"He is, indeed,\" said the man, with a polite bow. \"Our mighty Emperor has  lately caused himself to be nickel-plated.\"    \"Good Gracious!\" the Scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this. \"If his wit bears  the same polish, how sparkling it must be! But show us in--I'm sure the  Emperor will receive us, even in his present state\"    \"The Emperor's state is always magnificent,\" said the man. \"But I will  venture to tell him of your arrival, and will receive his commands  concerning you.\"    So the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room, and the Saw-  Horse ambled awkwardly after them, having no knowledge that a horse might be  expected to remain outside.        124    The travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings, and even  the Scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver  cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes. Upon a  handsome center-table stood a large silver oil-can, richly engraved with  scenes from the past adventures of the Tin Woodman, Dorothy, the Cowardly  Lion and the Scarecrow: the lines of the engraving being traced upon the  silver in yellow gold. On the walls hung several portraits, that of the  Scarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed, while a  the large painting of the famous Wizard of Oz, in act of presenting the Tin  Woodman with a heart, covered almost one entire end of the room.    While the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly  heard a loud voice in the next room exclaim:    \"Well! well! well! What a great surprise!\"    And then the door burst open and Nick Chopper rushed into their midst and  caught the Scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into  many folds and wrinkles.    \"My dear old friend! My noble comrade!\" cried the Tin Woodman, joyfully.  \"how delighted!,\" I am to meet you once again.        125               Full page line-art drawing.                   CAUGHT THE SCARECROW IN A CLOSE AND LOVING EMBRACE        126    And then he released the Scarecrow and held him at arms' length while he  surveyed the beloved, painted features.    But, alas! the face of the Scarecrow and many portions of his body bore  great blotches of putz-pomade; for the Tin Woodman, in his eagerness to  welcome his friend, had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had  rubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade.    \"Dear me!\" said the Scarecrow dolefully. \"What a mess I'm in!\"    \"Never mind, my friend,\" returned the Tin Woodman,\" I'll send you to my  Imperial Laundry, and you'll come out as good as new.\"    \"Won't I be mangled?\" asked the Scarecrow.    \"No, indeed!\" was the reply. \"But tell me, how came your Majesty here? and  who are your companions?\"    The Scarecrow, with great politeness, introduced Tip and Jack Pumpkinhead,  and the latter personage seemed to interest the Tin Woodman greatly.    \"You are not very substantial, I must admit,\" said the Emperor. \"but you are  certainly unusual, and therefore worthy to become a member of our select  society.\"    \"I thank your Majesty, said Jack, humbly.        127               Line-Art Drawing      \"I hope you are enjoying good health?\" continued the Woodman.    \"At present, yes;\" replied the Pumpkinhead, with a sigh; \"but I am in  constant terror of the day when I shall spoil.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the Emperor--but in a kindly, sympathetic tone. \"Do not,  I beg of you, dampen today's sun with the showers of tomorrow. For before  your head has time to spoil you can have it canned, and in that way it may  be preserved indefinitely.\"    Tip, during this conversation, was looking at the Woodman with undisguised  amazement, and noticed that the celebrated Emperor of the Winkies was  composed entirely of pieces of tin, neatly soldered        128  and riveted together into the form of a man. He rattled and clanked a  little, as he moved, but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly  constructed, and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of  polishing-paste that covered him from head to foot.    The boy's intent gaze caused the Tin Woodman to remember that he was not in  the most presentable condition, so he begged his friends to excuse him while  he retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him.  This was accomplished in a short time, and when the emperor returned his  nickel-plated body shone so magnificently that the Scarecrow heartily  congratulated him on his improved appearance.    \"That nickel-plate was, I confess, a happy thought,\" said Nick; \"and it was  the more necessary because I had become somewhat scratched during my  adventurous experiences. You will observe this engraved star upon my left  breast. It not only indicates where my excellent heart lies, but covers very  neatly the patch made by the Wonderful Wizard when he placed that valued  organ in my breast with his own skillful hands.\"    \"Is your heart, then, a hand-organ?\" asked the Pumpkinhead, curiously.        129    \"By no means,\" responded the emperor, with dignity. \"It is, I am convinced,  a strictly orthodox heart, although somewhat larger and warmer than most  people possess.\"    Then he turned to the Scarecrow and asked:    \"Are your subjects happy and contented, my dear friend?\"    \"I cannot, say\" was the reply. \"for the girls of Oz have risen in revolt and  driven me out of the emerald City.\"    \"Great Goodness!\" cried the Tin Woodman, \"What a calamity! They surely do  not complain of your wise and gracious rule?\"    \"No; but they say it is a poor rule that don't work both ways,\" answered the  Scarecrow; \"and these females are also of the opinion that men have ruled  the land long enough. So they have captured my city, robbed the treasury of  all its jewels, and are running things to suit themselves.\"    \"Dear me! What an extraordinary idea!\" cried the Emperor, who was both  shocked and surprised.    \"And I heard some of them say,\" said Tip, \"that they intend to march here  and capture the castle and city of the Tin Woodman.\"    \"Ah! we must not give them time to do that,\" said the Emperor, quickly; \"we  will go at once and        130               Full page line-art drawing.                   RENOVATING HIS MAJESTY, THE SCARECROW.        131  recapture the Emerald City and place the Scarecrow again upon his throne.\"    \"I was sure you would help me,\" remarked the Scarecrow in a pleased voice.  \"How large an army can you assemble?\"    \"We do not need an army,\" replied the Woodman. \"We four, with the aid of my  gleaming axe, are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels.\"    \"We five,\" corrected the Pumpkinhead.    \"Five?\" repeated the Tin Woodman.    \"Yes; the Saw-Horse is brave and fearless,\" answered Jack, forgetting his  recent quarrel with the quadruped.    The Tin Woodman looked around him in a puzzled way, for the Saw-Horse had  until now remained quietly standing in a corner, where the Emperor had not  noticed him. Tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them, and it  approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and  the engraved oil-can.    \"I begin to think,\" remarked the Tin Woodman as he looked earnestly at the  Saw-Horse, \"that wonders will never cease! How came this creature alive?\"    \"I did it with a magic powder,\" modestly asserted the boy. \"and the Saw-  Horse has been very useful to us.\"        132    \"He enabled us to escape the rebels,\" added the Scarecrow.    \"Then we must surely accept him as a comrade,\" declared the emperor. \"A live  Saw-Horse is a distinct novelty, and should prove an interesting study. Does  he know anything?\"    \"Well, I cannot claim any great experience in life,\" the Saw-Horse answered  for himself. \"but I seem to learn very quickly, and often it occurs to me  that I know more than any of those around me.\"    \"Perhaps you do,\" said the emperor; \"for experience does not always mean  wisdom. But time is precious Just now, so let us quickly make preparations  to start upon our Journey.    The emperor called his Lord High Chancellor and instructed him how to run  the kingdom during his absence. Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken apart and  the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and  restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great Wizard. His  clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the Imperial tailors, and his crown  polished and again sewed upon his head, for the Tin Woodman insisted he  should not renounce this badge of royalty. The Scarecrow now presented a  very respectable appearance, and although in no way addicted to vanity he        133  was quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked. While  this was being done Tip mended the wooden limbs of Jack Pumpkinhead and made  them stronger than before, and the Saw-Horse was also inspected to see if he  was in good working order.    Then bright and early the next morning they set out upon the"]]]
