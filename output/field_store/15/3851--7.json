And were I obliged to  defend any particular system of this nature, which I never willingly  should do, I esteem none more plausible than that which ascribes an  eternal inherent principle of order to the world, though attended with  great and continual revolutions and alterations. This at once solves all  difficulties; and if the solution, by being so general, is not entirely  complete and satisfactory, it is at least a theory that we must sooner or  later have recourse to, whatever system we embrace. How could things have  been as they are, were there not an original inherent principle of order  somewhere, in thought or in matter? And it is very indifferent to which  of these we give the preference. Chance has no place, on any hypothesis,  sceptical or religious. Every thing is surely governed by steady,  inviolable laws. And were the inmost essence of things laid open to us,  we should then discover a scene, of which, at present, we can have no  idea. Instead of admiring the order of natural beings, we should clearly  see that it was absolutely impossible for them, in the smallest article,  ever to admit of any other disposition.    Were any one inclined to revive the ancient Pagan Theology, which  maintained, as we learn from HESIOD, that this globe was governed by  30,000 deities, who arose from the unknown powers of nature: you would  naturally object, CLEANTHES, that nothing is gained by this hypothesis;  and that it is as easy to suppose all men animals, beings more numerous,  but less perfect, to have sprung immediately from a like origin. Push the  same inference a step further, and you will find a numerous society of  deities as explicable as one universal deity, who possesses within  himself the powers and perfections of the whole society. All these  systems, then, of Scepticism, Polytheism, and Theism, you must allow, on  your principles, to be on a like footing, and that no one of them has any  advantage over the others. You may thence learn the fallacy of your  principles.          PART 7      But here, continued PHILO, in examining the ancient system of the soul of  the world, there strikes me, all on a sudden, a new idea, which, if just,  must go near to subvert all your reasoning, and destroy even your first  inferences, on which you repose such confidence. If the universe bears a  greater likeness to animal bodies and to vegetables, than to the works of  human art, it is more probable that its cause resembles the cause of the  former than that of the latter, and its origin ought rather to be  ascribed to generation or vegetation, than to reason or design. Your  conclusion, even according to your own principles, is therefore lame and  defective.    Pray open up this argument a little further, said DEMEA, for I do not  rightly apprehend it in that concise manner in which you have expressed  it.    Our friend CLEANTHES, replied PHILO, as you have heard, asserts, that  since no question of fact can be proved otherwise than by experience, the  existence of a Deity admits not of proof from any other medium. The  world, says he, resembles the works of human contrivance; therefore its  cause must also resemble that of the other. Here we may remark, that the  operation of one very small part of nature, to wit man, upon another very  small part, to wit that inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the  rule by which CLEANTHES judges of the origin of the whole; and he  measures objects, so widely disproportioned, by the same individual  standard. But to waive all objections drawn from this topic, I affirm,  that there are other parts of the universe (besides the machines of human  invention) which bear still a greater resemblance to the fabric of the  world, and which, therefore, afford a better conjecture concerning the  universal origin of this system. These parts are animals and vegetables.  The world plainly resembles more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a  watch or a knitting-loom. Its cause, therefore, it is more probable,  resembles the cause of the former. The cause of the former is generation  or vegetation. The cause, therefore, of the world, we may infer to be  something similar or analogous to generation or vegetation.    But how is it conceivable, said DEMEA, that the world can arise from any  thing similar to vegetation or generation?    Very easily, replied PHILO. In like manner as a tree sheds its seed into  the neighbouring fields, and produces other trees; so the great  vegetable, the world, or this planetary system, produces within itself  certain seeds, which, being scattered into the surrounding chaos,  vegetate into new worlds. A comet, for instance, is the seed of a world;  and after it has been fully ripened, by passing from sun to sun, and star  to star, it is at last tossed into the unformed elements which every  where surround this universe, and immediately sprouts up into a new  system.    Or if, for the sake of variety (for I see no other advantage), we should  suppose this world to be an animal; a comet is the egg of this animal:  and in like manner as an ostrich lays its egg in the sand, which, without  any further care, hatches the egg, and produces a new animal; so...    I understand you, says DEMEA: But what wild, arbitrary suppositions are  these! What data have you for such extraordinary conclusions? And is the  slight, imaginary resemblance of the world to a vegetable or an animal  sufficient to establish the same inference with regard to both? Objects,  which are in general so widely different, ought they to be a standard for  each other?    Right, cries PHILO: This is the topic on which I have all along insisted.  I have still asserted, that we have no data to establish any system of  cosmogony. Our experience, so imperfect in itself, and so limited both in  extent and duration, can afford us no probable conjecture concerning the  whole of things. But if we must needs fix on some hypothesis; by what  rule, pray, ought we to determine our choice? Is there any other rule  than the greater similarity of the objects compared? And does not a plant  or an animal, which springs from vegetation or generation, bear a  stronger resemblance to the world, than does any artificial machine,  which arises from reason and design?    But what is this vegetation and generation of which you talk? said DEMEA.  Can you explain their operations, and anatomise that fine internal  structure on which they depend?    As much, at least, replied PHILO, as CLEANTHES can explain the operations  of reason, or anatomise that internal structure on which it depends. But  without any such elaborate disquisitions, when I see an animal, I infer,  that it sprang from generation; and that with as great certainty as you  conclude a house to have been reared by design. These words, generation,  reason, mark only certain powers and energies in nature, whose effects  are known, but whose essence is incomprehensible; and one of these  principles, more than the other, has no privilege for being made a  standard to the whole of nature.    In reality, DEMEA, it may reasonably be expected, that the larger the  views are which we take of things, the better will they conduct us in our  conclusions concerning such extraordinary and such magnificent subjects.  In this little corner of the world alone, there are four principles,  reason, instinct, generation, vegetation, which are similar to each  other, and are the causes of similar effects. What a number of other  principles may we naturally suppose in the immense extent and variety of  the universe, could we travel from planet to planet, and from system to  system, in order to examine each part of this mighty fabric? Any one of  these four principles above mentioned, (and a hundred others which lie  open to our conjecture,) may afford us a theory by which to judge of the  origin of the world; and it is a palpable and egregious partiality to  confine our view entirely to that principle by which our own minds  operate. Were this principle more intelligible on that account, such a  partiality might be somewhat excusable: But reason, in its internal  fabric and structure, is really as little known to us as instinct or  vegetation; and, perhaps, even that vague, indeterminate word, Nature, to  which the vulgar refer every thing, is not at the bottom more  inexplicable. The effects of these principles are all known to us from  experience; but the principles themselves, and their manner of operation,  are totally unknown; nor is it less intelligible, or less conformable to  experience, to say, that the world arose by vegetation, from a seed shed  by another world, than to say that it arose from a divine reason or  contrivance, according to the sense in which CLEANTHES understands it.    But methinks, said DEMEA, if the world had a vegetative quality, and  could sow the seeds of new worlds into the infinite chaos, this power  would be still an additional argument for design in its author. For  whence could arise so wonderful a faculty but from design? Or how can  order spring from any thing which perceives not that order which it  bestows?    You need only look around you, replied PHILO, to satisfy yourself with  regard to this question. A tree bestows order and organisation on that  tree which springs from it, without knowing the order; an animal in the  same manner on its offspring; a bird on its nest; and instances of this  kind are even more frequent in the world than those of order, which arise  from reason and contrivance. To say, that all this order in animals and  vegetables proceeds ultimately from design, is begging the question; nor  can that great point be ascertained otherwise than by proving, a priori,  both that order is, from its nature, inseparably attached to thought; and  that it can never of itself, or from original unknown principles, belong"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],[0,"Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#11)"],[1,"truth,  has transmitted the mind of Jesus to believers in visions, dreams,  prophecyings, &c. For this purpose Jesus sent the SPIRIT into the  world, that he might reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of  judgment.    The Spirit, though unimbodied, now acts in all the authority,  influence, and power that Jesus himself would do if He were on the  earth in very person. But He acts upon and through the body of Christ,  which is the church; through the Spirit's possession of the church,  it displays the \"MANIFOLD WISDOM OF GOD.\" Whatever varied and abundant  wisdom Jesus himself possessed, the true Church ever has in a measure,  and is destined to have, even to perfect fulness--\"the fulness of his  stature.\"    But how is the true Church to show forth all the omniscience and  potency of Jesus? I answer, sir, by the Spirit of God that is in the  Church, by \"the laying on of hands.\" By this spirit it is signified  to Paul what shall befall him at Jerusalem; and also that the true  Church shall cease from off the earth, with all its miraculous gifts  and blessings, before the second coming of Christ. By the same spirit,  John saw that an angel would again come in the midst of heaven to  restore the original primitive gospel to the earth. By the same spirit  Zachariah heard and saw the angel that should bring it, speak to a  \"young man.\" Isaiah saw the young man take a \"sealed book from the  earth,\" that should be a \"marvellous work and wonder,\" confounding the  \"wisdom of the wise.\" By this spirit the camp of Israel saw and heard  seventy elders prophecy the very hour and moment that hands were laid  upon them. Paul saw and heard more than twelve disciples speak \"with  tongues and prophecy,\" as soon as the \"Holy Ghost\" was conferred by  \"laying on of hands.\"    No sooner had Annanias laid his hands on Saul, than the Holy Ghost,  ever faithful to his \"promise,\" filled the person of Saul, and opened  his eyes. The same spirit signified to Philip a mission to Gaza, and  after he had baptized the Ethiopian, caught him away with power. By  it also, Sampson stretched forth an arm of omnipotence and slew a  thousand men; and at another time overthrew a large and capacious  building, being filled with people, besides containing three thousand  men and women upon the roof. And by the same spirit, in this day, the  blind have been made to see, the lame to walk, and the deaf to hear,  and hundreds of persecuted famishing Saints, on the banks of the  Mississippi, have been miraculously fed by quails, as ancient Israel  were fed in the wilderness.    Now, sir, can you tell me why sin and blasphemy against the Holy  Spirit constituted a more heinous and unpardonable offence than sin  against the \"Son of Man?\" Surely there is an importance attached to the  office-work of this DIVINE AND MARVELLOUS WITNESS on the earth that  deserves attention. If there is no forgiveness of such an offence, it  becomes all men, not only to hear before they judge, but also to judge  \"righteous judgment.\" Jesus Christ has told us that He placed in His  Church apostles and prophets, with gifts of miracles, tongues, &c.  These gifts were the gifts of the spirit; and you will not deny that  the Spirit of God, so far as the New Testament speaks of Him, was a  spirit of almighty power, as displayed in numerous gifts and ways.    Now, sir, what has become of this miraculous and almighty spirit? Has  he ceased wholly from the earth? If so, then the WATER and the BLOOD  are the only witnesses now left on the earth. But perhaps you will say  that the same spirit still remains, without exercising his miraculous  gifts and powers, (seeing they are not now necessary.) Shall we then  understand that this Almighty Spirit is still on the earth, and in the  diversified and conflicting churches, and comparatively silent and  inefficient, withholding from these churches (which are by supposition  the BODY of Christ), his majestic displays of supernatural power in  prophecies, healings, tongues; causing the dumb ass to speak with man's  voice, causing powerful armies to flee before the pursuit of one man;  and yet the world is perishing for lack of knowledge, and christianity  losing ground every day? Might we not as soon think the spirit has  grown old to dotage, or lost his first love, or been beguiled into  other pursuits of less importance? Surely He never wrought so lazily,  or in such imbecility and indifference in any other age, when true  believers or prophets were on the earth? Strange, indeed, sir, that he  should drop off so suddenly his royal robes of prophetic, miraculous  grandeur and power, to become the silent and inefficient inmate of  more than six hundred clashing, contentious churches, that are yearly  subdividing into minute fragments, to the confusion of all common sense  throughout boasting christendom! What a falling off of the spirit's  power, and of the spirit's light and unity! Will the Holy and Eternal  Spirit of God endorse such a powerless distracted state of things,  as being in any way connected with His presence on the earth, or  in any way the result of His doings? No, sir, by no means. For the  honour of this illustrious personage, let us never ascribe to HIM such  a powerless distracted organization of heterogenous ignorance and  imbecility, as modern christianity presents in contrast with ancient  christianity. The heavens may well blush with shame at this modern  picture, purporting to be the kingdom of God on the earth. If it is  the kingdom of God, how shorn of its miraculous strength! How are the  prophets and seers covered!! How dim that fine gold that once shown  resplendent with the celestial lustre of prophetic visions!!! Then men  spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and the sick were healed,  and he that lied to them was paralyzed in instantaneous death, at times.    Orators \"boast,\" as it is written of them in these \"perilous times,\"  of the spread of christianity. Christianity spreading! Where is the  evidence of its increase of power or knowledge? Where the least signs  of approximation to \"unity of faith,\" and the \"full stature measure of  Christ\" in \"manifold wisdom and power?\" Where the ornamental beauty  and symmetry of the Bride that is preparing for the marriage feast of  the Lamb? How many ten thousand years must elapse before it can be said  of christianity, \"the Bride hath made herself ready!\" \"clear as the  sun, fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.\" Surely,  since her prophets have lost their power \"to quench the violence of  fire, and subdue kingdoms, and stop the mouths of lions,\" and her  servants and handmaids to see visions, &c., the beauty of the Bride has  failed--her breasts have diminished--her face is wrinkled--her eyes are  dim and cannot see afar off; she is no longer a chaste virgin espoused  to one husband--but she has as many husbands as sects, and yet none of  those with whom she is now living can be called her husband.    Now, sir, will the Spirit join with such a _Bride_, and say to Jesus  the Great Bridegroom, \"come!\" the Bride hath made herself ready! No,  sir, the Spirit of God will say, I never knew you; depart from me, you  pusillanimous, benighted, powerless, contentious christianity. \"Thou  Aholibah and Aholibamah, thy lewdness is in all high places;\" \"thou  hast played the harlot with many lovers--yea, thou hast even hired  lovers\" (with human inventions), instead of commanding admiration by  the grace of thy \"seers,\" and the \"visions of thy handmaids,\" and the  \"healing power of thine elders.\" Thou shalt be burned with fire.    In humble assurance of your willingness to see the unsheathed  glittering sword of truth, I have the pleasure to subscribe myself.

Reverend and Dear Sir,--The subject of my sixth letter is APOSTACY FROM  THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH.    If modern christianity is only an enlargement of the system of early  apostacy from the true Apostolic Church of Christ, it certainly  deserves the most serious consideration. It shall be my direct object  in this epistle to show, that modern christianity possesses such a  faint resemblance to that system of faith established by Jesus Christ  and his apostles, that it cannot be called a likeness, or a copy, or  even an imitation.    Startle not, reverend sir, if I unhesitatingly declare that a  counterfeit bill of currency, that should have no more resemblance  to a true emission from the bank, than modern christianity does to  the ancient religion, would never be likely to do much harm. Modern  christianity is the very opposite extreme and counterpart of the  ancient order of \"apostles and prophets.\" If you will read patiently, I  will show clearly the proof of my position.    In the Primitive Church, the Holy Ghost, after Jesus left the earth,  came and took possession, and constituted the grand main-spring,  life, light, and power of it. And the apostle Peter (of indisputable  authority) declares, in the Second of Acts, that the _promised gift_  of the Holy Ghost SHOULD CONTINUE even to \"all the Lord our God should  call.\"    But this wonderful agent is not known in modern christianity. His  powerful agency, as foretold by Joel in prophecy, in tongues and  interpretation, in discerning of spirits and in healing, is not now  recognised as being any part of the present christianity. That Spirit  that was to make amends for the departure and absence of Jesus, by  acquainting believers with all truth--past, present, and future--that  they might be comforted with knowledge and light, such as could not  be obtained from books, whether inspired or uninspired, was the great  _sine qua non_ or essential thing in ancient christianity; but in  modern christianity, the fruits of such a spirit would be sneered at,  even by divines! What! exclaims one,"]]]
