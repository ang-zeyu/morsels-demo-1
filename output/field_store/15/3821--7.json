On the 27th, Mr. Hamilton Hume, whose experience well qualified him for  the task, and who had been associated with me in the expedition, having  joined me, we proceeded on our journey, and reached Wellington Valley  about the end of the month.    WELLINGTON VALLEY.    I wished to push into the interior without any delay, or at least, so soon  as we should have completed our arrangements and organized the party; but,  although Mr. Maxwell had paid every attention to the training of the  cattle, he was of opinion that they could not yet be wholly relied upon,  and strongly recommended that they should be kept at practice for another  week. As we could not have left the settlement under the most favourable  circumstances in less than four days, the further delay attendant on this  measure was considered immaterial, and it was, accordingly, determined  upon. Mr. Hume undertook to superintend the training of the animals, and  this left me at leisure to gather such information as would be of use to  us in our progress down the river.    In his description of Wellington Valley, Mr. Oxley has not done it more  than justice. It is certainly a beautiful and fertile spot, and it was now  abundant in pasturage, notwithstanding the unfavourable season that had  passed over it.    The settlement stands upon the right bank of the Bell, about two miles  above the junction of that stream with the Macquarie. Its whitewashed  buildings bore outward testimony to the cleanliness and regularity of the  inhabitants; and the respectful conduct of the prisoners under his charge,  showed that Mr. Maxwell had maintained that discipline by which alone he  could have secured respect to himself and success to his exertions, at  such a distance from the seat of government.    The weather was so exceedingly hot, during our stay, that it was  impossible to take exercise at noon; but in the evening, or at an early  hour in the morning, we were enabled to make short excursions in the  neighbourhood.    Mr. Maxwell informed me that there were three stations below the  settlement, the first of which, called Gobawlin, belonging to Mr. Wylde,  was not more than five miles from it; the other two, occupied by Mr.  Palmer, were at a greater distance, one being nineteen, the other  thirty-four miles below the junction of the Bell. He was good enough to  send for the stockman (or chief herdsman), in charge of the last, to give  me such information of the nature of the country below him, as he could  furnish from personal knowledge or from the accounts of the natives.    LOW STATE OF THE MACQUARIE RIVER.    Mr. Maxwell pointed out to me the spot on which Mr. Oxley's boats had been  built, close upon the bank of the Macquarie; and I could not but reflect  with some degree of apprehension on the singularly diminished state of the  river from what it must then have been to allow a boat to pass down it.  Instead of a broad stream and a rapid current, the stream was confined to  a narrow space in the centre of the channel, and it ran so feebly amidst  frequent shallows that it was often scarcely perceptible. The Bell, also,  which Mr. Oxley describes as dashing and rippling along its pebbly bed,  had ceased to flow, and consisted merely of a chain of ponds.    On the 3rd of Dec, the stockman from below arrived; but the only  information we gathered from him was the existence of a lake to the left  of the river, about three days' journey below the run of his herds, on the  banks of which he assured us, the native companions, a species of stork,  stood in rows like companies of soldiers.    He brought up a nest of small paroquets of the most beautiful plumage, as  a present to Mr. Maxwell, and affirmed that they were common about his  part of the river. The peculiarity of the seasons had also brought a  parrot into the valley which had never before visited it. This delicate  bird was noticed by Captain Cook upon the coast, and is called  PSITTACUS NOVAE HOLLANDIAE, or New Holland Parrot, by Mr. Brown. It had  not, however, been subsequently seen until the summer of 1828, when it  made its appearance at Wellington Valley in considerable numbers, together  with a species of merops or mountain bee-eater.    DEPARTURE FOR THE INTERIOR.    On the 5th, our preparations being wholly completed, and the loads  arranged, the party was mustered, and was found to consist of myself and  Mr. Hume, two soldiers and eight prisoners of the crown, two of whom were  to return with dispatches. Our animals numbered two riding, and seven  pack, horses, two draft, and eight pack, bullocks, exclusive of two  horses of my own, and two for the men to be sent back.    BANKS OF THE MACQUARIE.    The morning of the 7th December, the day upon which we were to leave the  valley, was ushered in by a cloudless sky, and that heated appearance in  the atmosphere which foretells an oppressively sultry day. I therefore put  off the moment of our departure to the evening, and determined to proceed  no further than Gobawlin. I was the more readily induced to order this  short journey because the animals had not been practised to their full  loads, and I thought they might have given some trouble at starting with  an unusual weight. They moved off however very quietly, and as if they had  been accustomed to their work by a long course of training. We took our  departure from the settlement at 3 p.m. and, crossing to the right bank of  the Macquarie, a little above its junction with the Bell, reached Mr  Wylde's station about half-past five. Thus we commenced our journey under  circumstances as favorable as could have been wished. In disengaging  ourselves on the following day from the hills by which Wellington Valley  is encompassed on the westward, with a view to approach Mr. Palmer's first  station, we kept rather wide of the river, and only occasionally touched  on its more projecting angles. The soil at a distance from the stream was  by no means so good as that in its immediate vicinity, nor was the timber  of the same description. On the rich and picturesque grounds near the  river the angophora prevailed with the flooded gum, and the scenery upon  its banks was improved by the casuarinae that overhung them. On the  latter, inferior eucalypti and cypresses were mixed together. The country  was broken and undulating, and the hills stony, notwithstanding which,  they appeared to have an abundance of pasture upon them. Mr. Hume rode  with me to the summit of a limestone elevation, from which I thought it  probable we might have obtained such a view as would have enabled us to  form some idea of the country into which we were about to descend. But in  following the river line, the eye wandered over a dark and unbroken  forest alone. The ranges from which we were fast receding formed an  irregular and beautiful landscape to the southward; and contrasted  strongly with the appearance of the country to the N. W., in which  direction it was rapidly assuming a level.    We reached Mr. Palmer's at a late hour in the afternoon, in consequence of  a delay we experienced in crossing a gully, and encamped upon a high bank  immediately opposite to the mouth of Molle's rivulet which here joins the  Macquarie from the southward. The cattle had consumed all the food, and  the ground on both sides of the river looked bare and arid.    No doubt, however, the face of the country in ordinary seasons wears a  very different appearance. Its general elevation continued high; nor did  the Macquarie assume any change of aspect. Mountain debris and rounded  pebbles of various kinds formed its bed, which was much encumbered with  timber.    DIBILAMBLE.    We had been unable to persuade any of the natives of Wellington Valley to  accompany us as guides, on our leaving that settlement. Even Mr. Maxwell's  influence failed; for, notwithstanding the promises of several, when they  saw that we were ready to depart, they either feigned sickness or stated  that they were afraid of the more distant natives. The fact is, that they  were too lazy to wander far from their own district, and too fond of  Maxwell's beef to leave it for a precarious bush subsistence. Fortunately  we found several natives with Mr. Palmer's stockmen, who readily undertook  to conduct us by the nearest route to the cataract, which we considered to  be midway between Wellington Valley and Mount Harris. We started under  their guidance for Dibilamble, Mr. Palmer's second station, and reached it  about half-past 4 p.m. The distance between the two is sixteen miles. The  country for some miles differs in no material point from that through  which we had already passed. The same rich tracts of soil near the river  and the same inferiority in the tracks remote from it. Near Dibilamble,  however, the limestone formation terminates, and gives place to barren  stony ridges, upon which the cypress callities is of close and stunted  growth. The ridges themselves were formed of a coarse kind of freestone  in a state of rapid decomposition. The Tabragar (the Erskine of Mr. Oxley)  falls into the Macquarie at Dibilamble. It had long ceased to flow, being  a small mountain torrent whose source, if we judge from the shingly nature  of its bed, cannot be very distant. Our descent was considerable during  the day; the rapids were frequent in the river, but it underwent no change  in its general appearance. Its waters were hard and transparent, and its  banks, in many places, extremely lofty; with a red sandy loam and gravel  under the alluvial deposits. It generally"]]]
