It is also useful to note, with reference to the groove F, in which  passes, in man, the tendon of the posterior ulnar muscle, that, when the  forearm is in pronation, the radius alone being displaced, we can only  see this groove on the surface which looks backwards; and that it is  then separated from the groove which contains the tendon of the special  extensor of the little finger by an interval equal to the thickness of  the head of the ulna.[12] When the forearm is supinated, the two grooves  are found, on the other hand, one beside the other: and the tendons  which they contain are very naturally in contact.      [12] Edouard Cuyer, 'Shape of the Region of the Wrist in Supination         and Pronation' (_Bulletin de la Societe d'Anthropologie_, Paris,         1888).    In birds the forearm is flexed on the arm, and the latter being directed  downwards and backwards, the former is, consequently, directed upwards  and forwards. Further, because of the position of the humerus, which, as  we mentioned on p. 32, has its inferior extremity so turned that the  surface which is anterior in man becomes external, the radius, instead  of being outside the ulna, is placed above it. This latter is larger  than the radius, but its olecranon process is very slightly developed.      The Hand    The hand in animals, as in man, is formed of three parts--the carpus,  metacarpus, and fingers. In man, the forearm and the hand being  described in the position of supination; the bones of the carpus are  named in passing from the most external to the most internal--that is to  say, from that which corresponds to the radial side of the forearm to  that which corresponds to the ulnar side. In animals in which, as we  know, but it is not unprofitable to repeat, the hand is in pronation,  the radial side of the forearm being placed inside, we enumerate the  carpal bones in counting the most internal as the first; this is the  only method which permits us, in taking our point of departure from the  human skeleton as our standard, to recognise the homologies of the bones  of the carpal region.    These bones, eight in number, are arranged in two transverse rows, of  which one, the first, is superior or antibrachial; the other, the  second, is inferior or metacarpal. Each of these rows contains four  bones. Considered in the order we have indicated above--that is to say,  proceeding from the radial to the ulnar side--they are thus named:  scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform, in the first row;  trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform, in the second. The number  of these bones is not the same in all animals on account of the  coalescence or absence of some. In each row the bones are placed side by  side, with the exception of the pisiform, which being placed on the  palmar surface of the cuneiform, produces a small projection in man, but  a very pronounced one in quadrupeds.    The pisiform is called the _hooked bone_ in some veterinary anatomies.  If we consider the hook which it forms, we may recognise that the name  is appropriate; but from the point of view of comparison with the human  carpus, the name is unfortunate, for it creates confusion between the  true pisiform (the fourth bone in the upper row), and the last bone in  the lower row, which is the veritable unciform bone. We do not here seek  for similarity of form, but homology of regions; and it is only by using  the same names to denote the same things that we can succeed in  determining such homology.    Taken as a whole, the bones of the carpus form a mass which, by its  superior border, articulates with the bones of the forearm, and by its  inferior border is in relation with the metacarpal region. Its dorsal  surface (anterior in quadrupeds) is slightly convex; its palmar surface  (posterior in quadrupeds) is excavated, and forms a groove in which pass  the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. This last, in man, has the  appearance of a gutter, because of the prominences caused by the  projection of the internal and external bones beyond their fellows.    In quadrupeds the palmar groove is especially determined by the pisiform  bone, of which we have just mentioned the great development.    The region occupied by the carpus, in the unguligrades, is known as the  _knee_; it would have been more appropriately named had it been called  the _wrist_.    The number of the metacarpal bones in mammals never exceeds five, but it  often falls below it; the same is true for the digits. The first are  generally equal in number to the latter; an exception is met with in  ruminants, whose two metacarpals coalescing soon after birth, form but  one bone; this, the _canon_ bone, articulates with two digits.    The number of metacarpals and digits diminishes in proportion as the  limbs cease to be organs of prehension, and become more exclusively  organs of support and locomotion.    The number of phalanges is two for the thumb and three for each of the  other digits; except in the cetaceans, in which they are more numerous.    In the bat, the metacarpals and phalanges are very long, and form the  skeleton of the wing; these phalanges are not furnished with nails; the  thumb, which is very short, is alone provided with one (Fig. 8).    With regard to the relative dimensions of the bones of the metacarpus,  it is necessary to remember that, in the human being, the second  metacarpal is the longest; then, in the order of decrease, come the  third, fourth, fifth, and first. In quadrupeds we shall also find  differences in length (see the chapter relating to the anterior limbs in  certain animals), but the order of decrease is not always that which we  have just mentioned.    In man the articular surface, situated at the inferior extremity of each  of the metacarpals, is rounded, and is called the head. This allows the  first phalanx, which is in relation with that surface, to be displaced  in every direction; indeed, this phalanx can not only be flexed and  extended, but it can also be moved laterally; this latter movement  allows of the fingers being separated and drawn together.    In quadrupeds which can only perform the movements of flexion and  extension of the digits--for example, the horse--the inferior extremity  of the metacarpal has not a rounded head of a regular outline; it is  marked by a prominent median crest, directed from before backwards, so  that the articular surfaces, which fit more exactly, form a sort of  hinge which allows of backward and forward movements only, and permits  no lateral displacement. In man, at the level of the inferior extremity  of the first metacarpal, in the vicinity of the articulation of this  bone with the first phalanx of the thumb, we find two sesamoid  bones--small bones developed in the fibrous tissue which surrounds the  articulation. We also meet with such structures, but more rarely, at the  level of the corresponding articulation of the index and auricular  digits; and, more rarely still, at those of the middle and ring fingers.  In quadrupeds, these bones are normally developed, and we shall see  afterwards that in some animals, as they reach a considerable size, they  are able to influence the external outlines; we shall see this, for  example, in the horse.    The hand, in birds, is directed obliquely downwards and backwards (Fig.  31). For the better understanding of its position in relation to the  forearm, we should remember that this latter, as we have described (p.  44), directed obliquely upwards and forwards,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3833"],[0,"Australian Legendary Tales: folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as told to the (#11)"],[1,"first, and then a woman, for  as they came from the back country, where no creeks were, the women  could not swim.    Goomblegubbon came back from hunting, and, seeing no wives, called  aloud for them, but heard no answer. Then he went to their camp, and  found them not. Then turning towards the dungle he saw that it was  empty. Then he saw the tracks of his wives and children going towards  the river. Great was his anger, and vowing he would kill them when he  found them, he picked up his spears and followed their tracks, until he  too reached the river. There on the other side he saw a camp, and in it  he could see strange black fellows, his wives, and his children. He  called aloud for them to cross him over, for he too could not swim. But  the sun went down and still they did not answer. He camped where he was  that night, and in the morning he saw the camp opposite had been  deserted and set fire to; the country all round was burnt so that not  even the tracks of the black fellows and his wives could be found, even  had he been able to cross the river. And never again did he see or hear  of his wives or his children.          18.  MOOREGOO THE MOPOKE, AND BAHLOO THE MOON      Mooregoo the Mopoke had been camped away by himself for a long time.  While alone he had made a great number of boomerangs, nullah-nullahs,  spears, neilahmans, and opossum rugs. Well had he carved the weapons  with the teeth of opossums, and brightly had he painted the inside of  the rugs with coloured designs, and strongly had he sewn them with the  sinews of opossums, threaded in the needle made of the little bone  taken from the leg of an emu. As Mooregoo looked at his work he was  proud of all he had done.    One night Babloo the moon came to his camp, and said: \"Lend me one of  your opossum rugs.\"    \"No. I lend not my rugs.\"    \"Then give me one.\"    \"No. I give not my rugs.\"    Looking round, Bahloo saw the beautifully carved weapons, so he said,  \"Then give me, Mooregoo, some of your weapons.\"    \"No, I give, never, what I have made, to another.\"    Again Bahloo said, \"The night is cold. Lend me a rug.\"    \"I have spoken,\" said Mooregoo. \"I never lend my rugs.\"    Barloo said no more, but went away, cut some bark and made a dardurr  for himself. When it was finished and he safely housed in it, down came  the rain in torrents. And it rained without ceasing until the whole  country was flooded. Mooregoo was drowned. His weapons floated about  and drifted apart, and his rugs rotted in the water.          19.  OUYAN THE CURLEW      Bleargah the hawk, mother of Ouyan the curlew, said one day to her son:  \"Go, Ouyan, out, take your spears and kill an emu. The women and I are  hungry. You are a man, go out and kill, that we may eat. You must not  stay always in the camp like an old woman; you must go and hunt as  other men do, lest the women laugh at you.\"    Ouyan took his spears and went out hunting, but though he went far, he  could not get an emu, yet he dare not return to the camp and face the  jeers of the women. Well could they jeer, and angry could his mother  grow when she was hungry. Sooner than return empty-handed he would cut  some flesh off his own legs. And this he decided to do. He made a cut  in his leg with his comebo and as he made it, cried aloud: \"Yuckay!  Yuckay,\" in pain. But he cut on, saying: \"Sharper would cut the tongues  of the women, and deeper would be the wounds they would make, if I  returned without food for them.\" And crying: \"Yuckay, yuckay,\" at each  stroke of his comebo, he at length cut off a piece of flesh, and  started towards the camp with it.    As he neared the camp his mother cried out: \"What have you brought us,  Ouyan? We starve for meat, come quickly.\"    He came and laid the flesh at her feet, saying: \"Far did I go, and  little did I see, but there is enough for all to-night; to-morrow will  I go forth again.\"    The women cooked the flesh, and ate it hungrily. Afterwards they felt  quite ill, but thought it must be because they had eaten too hungrily.  The next day they hurried Ouyan forth again. And again he returned  bringing his own flesh back. Again the women ate hungrily of it, and  again they felt quite ill.    Then, too, Beeargah noticed for the first time that the flesh Ouyan  brought looked different from emu flesh. She asked him what flesh it  was. He replied: \"What should it be but the flesh of emu?\"    But Beeargah was not satisfied, and she said to the two women who lived  with her: \"Go you, to-morrow, follow Ouyan, and see whence he gets this  flesh.\"    The next day, the two woman followed Ouyan when he went forth to hunt.  They followed at a good distance, that he might not notice that they  were following. Soon they heard him crying as if in pain: \"Yuckay,  yuckay, yuckay nurroo gay gay.\" When they came near they saw he was  cutting the flesh off his own limbs. Before he discovered that they  were watching him, back they went to the old woman, and told her what  they had seen.    Soon Ouyan came back, bringing, as usual, the flesh with him. When he  had thrown it down at his mother's feet, he went away, and lay down as  if tired from the chase. His mother went up to him, and before he had  time to cover his mutilated limbs, she saw that indeed the story of the  women was true. Angry was she that he had so deceived her: and she  called loudly for the other two women, who came running to her.    \"You are right,\" she said. \"Too lazy to hunt for emu, he cut off his  own flesh, not caring that when we unwittingly ate thereof we should  sicken. Let us beat him who did us this wrong.\"    The three women seized poor Ouyan and beat him, though he cried aloud  in agony when the blows fell on his bleeding legs.    When the women had satisfied their vengeance, Beeargah said: \"You Ouyan  shall have no more flesh on your legs, and red shall they be for ever;  red, and long and fleshless.\" Saying which she went, and with her the  other women. Ouyan crawled away and hid himself, and never again did  his mother see him. But night after night was to be heard a wailing cry  of, \"Bou you gwai gwai. Bou you gwai gwai,\" which meant, \"My poor red  legs. My poor red legs.\"    But though Ouyan the man was never seen again, a bird with long thin  legs, very red in colour under the feathers, was seen often, and heard  to cry ever at night, even as Ouyan the man had cried: \"Bou you gwai  gwai. Bou you gwai gwai.\" And this bird bears always the name of Ouyan.          20.  DINEWAN THE EMU, AND WAHN THE CROWS      Dinewan and his two wives, the Wahn, were camping out. Seeing some  clouds gathering, they made a bark humpy. It came on to rain, and they  all took shelter under it. Dinewan, when his wives were not looking,  gave a kick against a piece of bark at one side of the humpy, knocked  it down, then told his wives to go and put it up again. When they were  outside putting it up, he gave a kick, and knocked down a piece on the  other side; so no sooner were they in again than out they had to go.  This he did time after time, until at last they su spected him, and  decided that one of them would watch. The one who was watching saw  Dinewan laugh to himself and go and knock down the bark they had just  put up, chuckling at the thought of his wives having to go out in the  wet and cold to put it up, while he had his supper dry and comfortably  inside. The one who saw him told the other, and they decided to teach  him a lesson. So in they came, each with a piece of bark filled with  hot coals. They went straight up to Dinewan, who was lying down  laughing.    \"Now,\" they said, \"you shall feel as hot we did cold.\" And they threw  the coals over him. Dinewan jumped up, crying aloud with the pain, for  he was badly burnt. He rolled himself over, and ran into the rain; and  his wives stayed inside, and laughed aloud at him.          21.  GOOLAHWILLEEL THE TOPKNOT PIGEONS      Young Goolahwilleeel used to go out hunting every day. His mother and  sisters always expected that he would bring home kangaroo and emu for  them. But each day he came home without any meat at all. They asked him  what he did in the bush, as he evidently did not hunt. He said that he  did hunt.    \"Then why,\" said they, \"do you bring us nothing home?\"    \"I cannot catch and kill what I follow,\" he said. \"You hear me cry out  when I find kangaroo or emu; is it not so?\"    \"Yes; each day we hear you call when you find something, and each day  we get ready the fire, expecting you to bring home the spoils of the  chase, but you bring nothing.\"    \"To-morrow,\" he said, \"you shall not be disappointed. I will bring you  a kangaroo.\"    Every day, instead of hunting, Goolahwilleel had been gathering  wattle-gum, and with this he had been modelling a kangaroo--a perfect  model of one, tail, ears, and all complete. So the next day he came  towards the camp carrying this kangaroo made of gum. Seeing him coming,  and also seeing that he was carrying the promised kangaroo, his mother  and sisters said: \"Ah, Goolahwilleel spoke truly. He has kept his word,  and now brings us a kangaroo. Pile up the fire. To-night we shall eat  meat.\"    About a hundred yards away from the camp Goolahwilleel put down his  model, and came on without it. His mother called out: \"Where is the  kangaroo you brought home?\"    \"Oh, over there.\" And he pointed towards where he had left it.    The sisters ran to get it, but came back saying: \"Where is it? We  cannot see it.\"    \"Over there,\" he said, pointing again.    \"But there is only a great figure of gum there.\"    \"Well, did I say it was anything else? Did I not say it was gum?\"    \"No, you did not. You said it was a kangaroo.\"    \"And so it is a kangaroo. A beautiful kangaroo that I made all by  myself.\" And he smiled quite proudly to think what a fine kangaroo he  had made.    But his mother and sisters did not smile. They seized him and gave him  a good beating for deceiving them. They told him he should"]]]
