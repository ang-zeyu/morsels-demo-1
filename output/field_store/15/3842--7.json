Or they may--\" He stopped suddenly, and  then exclaimed:    \"Come on, Ned! They're after one of the airships! That's it! My  big biplane is all ready to start, and they can get it in motion  inside of a few seconds. Oh, why didn't I hurry?\" he added,  bitterly.    But the hangar was still some distance away, and it would take two  or three minutes of running to reach it.    Meanwhile, and at the instant Tom had his thought of the possible  theft of his biggest aircraft, something happened.    The doors of the shed were suddenly thrown open, and the two boys  could see the large airship being wheeled out. The hazy light of  the moon behind the clouds shone on the expanse of white planes,  and on the fish-tail rudder, one of Tom's latest ideas.    \"Hey, there!\" cried Tom, warningly.    \"Leave that alone!\" yelled Ned.    \"Koku! Koku!\" shouted Tom, shrilly. \"Get after those fellows!\"    \"Me get!\" boomed out the giant, in his deep voice.    He had been standing near the entrance to the hangar, probably  waiting for developments, and watching for the arrival of Tom and  Ned. The big form was seen to leap forward, and then several dark  shadows swarmed from around the airship, and were seen to fling  themselves upon the giant.    \"That's a fight!\" cried Ned. \"They're attacking him!\"    \"Koku can take care of himself!\" murmured Tom. \"But come on. I  don't see what their game is.\"    He understood a moment later, however, for while several of the  midnight visitors were engaged in a hand-to-hand tussle with the  giant there came a sharp, throbbing roar of the airship motor in  motion. The propellers were being whirled rapidly about.    \"Koku! Koku!\" cried Tom, for he was still some distance off.  \"Never mind them! Don't let the airship be taken!\"    But Koku could only grunt. Big and strong as he was, half a dozen  men attacking him at once hampered him. He threw them from him,  one after another, and was gradually making his way toward the now  slowly-moving airship. But would he be in time?    Tom and Ned could not hope to reach the machine before Koku,  though they were running at top speed.    \"Koku! Koku!\" yelled Tom. \"Don't let them get away!\"    But Koku could only grunt--harder this time--for he fell heavily,  being tripped by a stick thrust between his legs. He lay for a  moment stunned.    \"They're going to get away!\" panted Tom, making an effort to  increase his speed.    \"That's what!\" agreed Ned.    Even as they spoke the roar of the airship motor increased.  Several of the dark forms which had been engaged in the struggle  with Koku were seen to pick themselves up, and run toward the  airship, that was now in motion, moving on the bicycle wheels over  the grass plot, preparatory to mounting upward in the sky.    \"Stop! Stop!\" commanded Tom. But it was all in vain.    The men leaped aboard the airship, which could carry six persons,  and a moment later, with a deafening roar, as the engine opened up  full, the big craft shot upward, taking away all but two of the  midnight visitors. These, who had seemingly been stunned by Koku,  now arose from the ground, and staggered off in the darkness.    \"Get them!\" cried Tom.    \"We must see to Koku!\" added Ned, \"Look, there goes your airship,  Tom!\"    \"Yes, I know. But we can't stop that now. Let's see if we can get  a clue in these fellows!\"    He pointed toward the two who had run off in the dark underbrush  surrounding the hangar plaza, and he and Ned trailed them as well  as they could. But from the first they knew it would be useless,  for there were many hiding places, and, a little way beyond, was a  clump of trees.    After a short search Tom gave up reluctantly, and came back to  where Koku was now sitting on the ground.    \"Are you hurt?\" he asked of the giant.    \"My mind hurt--that all,\" said the big man.    \"I guess he means his feelings are hurt,\" Tom explained. \"Do you  know who they were, Koku?\"    \"No, master.\"    \"But we must do something!\" cried Ned. \"They've got your airship,  Tom.\"    \"I know it,\" said the young inventor, calmly. \"But we can't do  anything now. You can hardly hear her, let alone see her. She's  moving fast!\"    He pointed upward to the darkness. Like some black bird of prey  the airship was already lost to sight, though it would have seemed  as if her white planes might render her visible. But she had moved  so swiftly that, during the short search, she had already  disappeared.    \"Aren't you going to do anything?\" asked Ned.    \"Certainly,\" spoke Tom. \"I'm going to telephone an alarm to all  the nearby towns. This is certainly a queer game, Ned.\"            CHAPTER XII    A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE      Disappointed and puzzled, Tom and Ned went to where Koku was  standing in rather a dazed attitude. The giant, like all large  bodies, moved slowly, not only bodily but mentally. He could  understand exactly what had happened, except that he had not  prevailed over the \"pygmies\" who had attacked him. They had been  too many for him.    \"Let's take a look inside,\" suggested Tom, when, by another glance  upward, he had made sure that all trace of his big airship was  gone. \"Maybe we can get a clue. Then, Koku, you tell us what  happened.\"    \"It all happened to me,\" said the giant, simply. \"Me no make  anything happen to them.\"    \"That's about right,\" laughed Tom, ruefully. \"It all happened to  us.\"    The lights in the hangar were switched on, but a careful search  revealed little. The men, half a dozen or more, had come evidently  well prepared for the taking away of Tom Swift's airship, and they  had done so.    Entrance had been effected by forcing a small side door. True, the  burglar alarm had given notice of the presence of the men, but Tom  and Ned had not acted quite quickly enough. Koku had been at the  hangar almost as soon as the men themselves, but he had watched  and waited for orders, instead of going in at once, and this had  given the intruders time to wheel out the craft and start the  motor.    \"Why didn't you jump right in on them when you saw what they were  up to, Koku?\" asked Tom.    \"Me wait for master. Me think master want to see who men were. Me  go in--they run.\"    \"Well, of course that's so, in a way,\" admitted Tom. \"They  probably would have run, but they'd have run WITHOUT my airship  instead of WITH it, if they hadn't had time to get it outside the  hangar. However, there's no use in crying over lost biplanes. The  next thing is how to get her back. Did you know any of the men,  Koku?\"    \"No, master.\"    \"Then we haven't any clue that way. They laid their plans well.  They just let you tangle yourself up with them, Koku, while the  head ones got the motor going; an easy matter, since it was all  ready to start. Then they tripped you, Koku, and as many of them  as could, made a jump for the machine. Then they were off.\"    \"Well, what's the next thing to do?\" asked Ned, when another look  about the shed had shown that not the slightest clue was  available.    \"I'm going to do some telephoning,\" Tom stated. \"A big airship  like mine can't go scooting around the country without being  noticed. And those fellows can't go on forever. They've got to  have gasoline and oil, and to get them they'll have to come down.  I'll get it back, sooner or later; but the question is: Why did  they take her?\"    \"To sell,\" suggested Ned.    \"I think not,\" Tom said. \"A big airship like mine isn't easy to  sell. People who would buy it would ask questions that might not  easily be answered. I'm inclined to think that some other reason  made them take her, and it's up to us to find out what it was.  Let's go into the house.\"    \"Hark!\" suddenly exclaimed Ned, holding up his hand for silence.  They all heard footsteps outside the hangar.    Tom sprang to the door, flashing his electric light, and a voice  exclaimed:    \"Golly! Chicken thieves!\"    \"Oh, is it you, Eradicate?\" asked the young inventor, with a  laugh. \"No, it isn't chicken thieves--they were after bigger game  this time.\"    \"Suffin happen?\" asked the colored man. \"Massa Swift he heah a  noise, an' see a light, an' he sent me out yeah t' see what all am  gwine on.\"    \"Yes, something happened,\" admitted Tom. \"They got the Eagle,  Rad.\"    \"What! Yo' big airship?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Huh! Dat's too bad, Massa Tom. I suah am sorry t' heah dat. Who  done it?\"    \"We don't know, Rad.\"    \"Maybe it was dat low-down cousin ob mine what tried t' git mah  chickens, onct!\"    \"No, Rad, it wasn't your cousin. But I'll telephone the alarm to  the police. They may be able to help me get the Eagle back.\"    Within the next hour several messages were sent to the authorities  of nearby towns, asking them to be on the watch for the stolen  airship. This was about all that could be done, and after Mr.  Swift had been told the story of the night's happenings, everyone  went back to bed again.    Further search the next morning brought forth no clues, though  Tom, Ned and the others beat about in the bushes where the men had  disappeared.    One or two reports were heard from surrounding towns, to the  effect that several persons had heard a strange throbbing sound in  the night, that, possibly, was caused by the passage of the  airship overhead. One such report came from Waterford, the home  town of Mr. Damon.    \"Let's go over there,\" suggested Ned, to his chum. \"I'd like to  see our friend, and maybe we can get some other clues by  circulating around there.\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" spoke Tom, rather listlessly.    \"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.    \"Well, I ought to be working on my photo telephone,\" was the  answer. \"I've got a new idea now. I'm going to try a different  kind of current, and use a more sensitive plate. And I'll use a  tungsten filament lamp in the sending booth.\"    \"Oh, let your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4544"],[0,"The Cell of Self-Knowledge : seven early English mystical treatises printed (#11)"],[1,"that there is no full  sikerness standing[193] upon dread only, for fear of sinking in to  over much heaviness, therefore shalt thou knit to thy first thought  this other thought that followeth. Thou shalt think steadfastly that  if thou may, through the grace of God, distinctly pronounce the  words of that prayer, and win to the end thereof, or if thou die  before thou come to the end, so that thou do that in thee is, that  then it shall be accepted of thee unto God, as a full aseeth[194] of  all thy recklessness from the beginning of thy life unto that  moment. I mean thus: standing that thou hast before time, after thy  conning and thy conscience, lawfully amended thee after the common  ordinance of holy Church in confession; this short prayer, so little  as it is, shall be accepted of thee unto God for thy full salvation,  if thou then didst die, and to the great increase of thy perfection,  if thou didst live longer. This is the goodness of God, the which,  as the prophet saith, forsaketh none that truly trusteth in Him with  will of amendment;[195] and sith that all amendment standeth in  two--that is, in leaving of evil and doing of good--means to get  these two are none readier than the ghostly working of these two  thoughts touched before. For what reaveth from a soul[196] more  readily the affection of sinning, than doth a true working of dread  of death? And what moveth a soul[197] more fervently to working of  good, than doth a certain hope in the mercy and the goodness of God,  the which is brought in by this second thought? For why, the ghostly  feeling of this second thought, when it is thus truly joined to the  first, shall be to thee a sure staff of hope to hold thee by in all  thy good doings. And by this staff thou mayst sikerly climb in to  the high mount of perfection, that is to say, to the perfect love of  God; though all this beginning be imperfect, as thou shalt hear  after. For, what for the general sight that thou hast of the mercy  and of the goodness of God, and this special experience that thou  feelest of His mercy and His goodness in this acceptation of this  little short service for so long recklessness, as it were in a full  aseeth of so much recklessness (as it is said before), it may not be  but that thou shalt feel a great stirring of love unto Him that is  so good and so merciful unto thee--as the steps of thy staff, hope,  plainly sheweth unto thee in the time of thy prayer, if thou do it  duly as I have told thee before.[198] The ghostly experience of the  proof of this working standeth all in a reverent affection that a  man hath to God in the time of his prayer, caused of this dread in  the ground of this work, and of this stirring of love, the which is  brought in by the ghostly steps of this staff hope, touched before.  For why, reverence is nought else but dread and love medled together  with a staff of certain hope,    Me thinketh that the proof of this working is devotion; for devotion  is nought else, as saint Thomas the doctor saith, but a readiness of  man's will to do those things that longeth to the service of  God.[199] Each man prove in himself, for he that doth God's service  in this manner, he feeleth how ready that his will is thereto. Me  thinketh that saint Bernard accordeth to this working, where he  saith that all things should be done swiftly and gladly. And see  why: swiftly for dread, and gladly for hope, and lovely trust in His  mercy. [And what more? Sikerly, I had lever have his meed that  lasteth in such doing, though all he never did bodily penance in  this life, but only that that is enjoined to him of holy Church,  than of all the penance-doers that have been in this life from the  beginning of the world unto this day without this manner of doing. I  say not that the naked thinking of these two thoughts is so meedful;  but that reverent affection, to the which bringing in these two  thoughts are sovereign means on man's party, that is it that is so  meedful as I say.[200]] And this is only it by itself, without any  other manner of doing (as is fasting, waking, sharp wearing, and all  these other), the which only by itself pleaseth almighty God, and  deserveth to have meed of Him. And it were impossible any soul to  have meed of God without this, and all after the quantity of this  shall stand the quantity of meed; for whoso hath much of this, much  meed shall he have, and whoso hath less of this, less meed shall he  have. And all these other things, as is fasting, waking, sharp  wearing, and all these other, they are needful[201] in as much as  they are helply to get this, so that without this they are nought.  And this without them is sometime sufficient at the full by itself,  and it is often times full worthily had and come to of full many  without any of the others. All this I say for that I would by this  knowing that thou charged and commended each thing after that it is:  the more, \"the more,\" and the less, \"the less\"; for oft times  unknowing is cause of much error. And oft times unknowing maketh men  to charge more and commend more bodily exercise (as is fasting,  waking, sharp wearing, and all these others) than they do ghostly  exercise in virtues or in this reverent affection touched before.  And, therefore, in more declaration of the meed and the worthiness  of this reverent affection, I shall say a little more than I yet  have said, so that, by such declaring, thou mayst be better learned  in this working than thou yet art.    All this manner of working beforesaid of this reverent affection,  when it is brought in by these two thoughts of dread and of hope  coming before, may well be likened to a tree that were full of  fruit; of the which tree, dread is that party that is within in the  earth, that is, the root. And hope is that party that is above the  earth, that is, the body[202] with the boughs. In that that hope is  certain and stable, it is the body; in that it stirreth men to works  of love, it is the boughs; but this reverent affection is evermore  the fruit, and then, evermore as long as the fruit is fastened to  the tree,[203] it hath in party a green smell of the tree; but when  it hath been a certain time departed from the tree and is full ripe,  then it hath lost all the taste of the tree, and is king's meat  [that was before but knave's meat].[204] In this time it is that  this reverent affection is so meedful as I said. And, therefore,  shape thee for to depart this fruit from the tree, and for to offer  it up by itself to the high King of heaven; and then shalt thou be  cleped God's own child, loving Him with a chaste love for Himself,  and not for His goods.[205] I mean thus: though all that the  innumerable good deeds, the which almighty God of His gracious  goodness hath shewed to each soul in this life, be sufficient causes  at the full and more, to each soul to love Him for, with all his  mind, with all his wit, and with all his will; yet if it might be,  that may no wise be, that a soul were as mighty, as worthy, and as  witty as all the saints and angels that are in heaven gathered in  one, and had never taken this worthiness of God,[206] or to whom  that God had never shewed kindness in this life; yet this soul,  seeing the loveliness of God in Himself, and the abundance thereof,  should be ravished over his might for to love God, till the heart  brast; so lovely and so liking, so good and so glorious He is in  Himself.    O how wonderful a thing and how high a thing is the love of God for  to speak of, of the which no man may speak perfectly to the  understanding of the least party thereof, but by impossible  ensamples, and passing the understanding of man! And thus it is that  I mean when I say loving Him with a chaste love for Himself, and not  for His goods;[207] not as if I said (though all I well said) much  for His goods, but without comparison more for Himself. For, if I  shall more highly speak in declaring of my meaning of the perfection  and of the meed of this reverent affection, I say that a soul  touched in affection by the sensible presence of Gods as He is in  Himself, and in a perfect soul illumined in the reason, by the clear  beam of everlasting light, the which is God, for to see and for to  feel the loveliness[208] of God in Himself, hath for that time and  for that moment lost all the mind of any good deed or of any  kindness that ever God did to him in this life--so that cause for to  love God for feeleth he or seeth he none in that time, other than is  God Himself. So that though all it may be said in speaking of the  common perfection, that the great goodness and the great kindness  that God hath shewed to us in this life are high and worthy causes  for to love God for; yet having beholding to the point and the prick  of perfection (to the which I purpose to draw thee in my meaning,  and in the manner of this writing), a perfect lover of God, for  dread of letting[209] of his perfection, seeketh now, that is to  say, in the point of perfection, none other cause for to love God  for, but God Himself; so that by this meaning I say, that chaste  love is to love God for Himself and not for His goods. And  therefore, following the rule of mine ensample, shape thee to depart  the fruit from the tree, and for to offer it up by itself unto the  King of heaven, that thy love be chaste; for evermore as long as  thou offrest Him this fruit green and hanging on the tree, thou  mayst well be likened to a woman that is not chaste, for she loveth  a man more for his goods than for himself. And see why that I liken  thee thus; for it seemeth that dread of thy death and shortness of  time, with hope of forgiveness of all thy recklessness, maketh thee  to be in God's service so reverent as thou art. And if it so be,  soothly then hath thy fruit a green smell of the tree; and though  all it pleaseth God in party, nevertheless, yet it pleaseth Him not  perfectly, and that is for thy love is "]]]
