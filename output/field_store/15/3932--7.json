Mrs. Bellmont would occasionally give instruction, though far different.  She would tell her she could not go where James was; she need not try.  If she should get to heaven at all, she would never be as high up as he.    HE was the attraction. Should she \"want to go there if she could not see  him?\"    Mrs. B. seldom mentioned her bereavement, unless in such allusion to  Frado. She donned her weeds from custom; kept close her crape veil for  so many Sabbaths, and abated nothing of her characteristic harshness.    The clergyman called to minister consolation to the afflicted widow and  mother. Aunt Abby seeing him approach the dwelling, knew at once the  object of his visit, and followed him to the parlor, unasked by Mrs. B!  What a daring affront! The good man dispensed the consolations, of which  he was steward, to the apparently grief-smitten mother, who talked like  one schooled in a heavenly atmosphere. Such resignation expressed, as  might have graced the trial of the holiest. Susan, like a mute sufferer,  bared her soul to his sympathy and godly counsel, but only replied to  his questions in short syllables. When he offered prayer, Frado stole to  the door that she might hear of the heavenly bliss of one who was her  friend on earth. The prayer caused profuse weeping, as any tender  reminder of the heaven-born was sure to. When the good man's voice  ceased, she returned to her toil, carefully removing all trace of  sorrow. Her mistress soon followed, irritated by Nab's impudence in  presenting herself unasked in the parlor, and upbraided her with  indolence, and bade her apply herself more diligently. Stung by  unmerited rebuke, weak from sorrow and anxiety, the tears rolled down  her dark face, soon followed by sobs, and then losing all control of  herself, she wept aloud. This was an act of disobedience. Her mistress  grasping her raw-hide, caused a longer flow of tears, and wounded a  spirit that was craving healing mercies.          CHAPTER X.    PERPLEXITIES.--ANOTHER DEATH.        Neath the billows of the ocean,      Hidden treasures wait the hand,      That again to light shall raise them      With the diver's magic wand.        G. W. COOK.        THE family, gathered by James' decease, returned to their homes. Susan  and Charles returned to Baltimore. Letters were received from the  absent, expressing their sympathy and grief. The father bowed like a  \"bruised reed,\" under the loss of his beloved son. He felt desirous to  die the death of the righteous; also, conscious that he was unprepared,  he resolved to start on the narrow way, and some time solicit entrance  through the gate which leads to the celestial city. He acknowledged his  too ready acquiescence with Mrs. B., in permitting Frado to be deprived  of her only religious privileges for weeks together. He accordingly  asked his sister to take her to meeting once more, which she was ready  at once to do.    The first opportunity they once more attended meeting together. The  minister conversed faithfully with every person present. He was  surprised to find the little colored girl so solicitous, and kindly  directed her to the flowing fountain where she might wash and be clean.  He inquired of the origin of her anxiety, of her progress up to this  time, and endeavored to make Christ, instead of James, the attraction of  Heaven. He invited her to come to his house, to speak freely her mind to  him, to pray much, to read her Bible often.    The neighbors, who were at meeting,--among them Mrs. Reed,--discussed  the opinions Mrs. Bellmont would express on the subject. Mrs. Reed  called and informed Mrs. B. that her colored girl \"related her  experience the other night at the meeting.\"    \"What experience?\" asked she, quickly, as if she expected to hear the  number of times she had whipped Frado, and the number of lashes set  forth in plain Arabic numbers.    \"Why, you know she is serious, don't you? She told the minister about  it.\"    Mrs. B. made no reply, but changed the subject adroitly. Next morning  she told Frado she \"should not go out of the house for one while, except  on errands; and if she did not stop trying to be religious, she would  whip her to death.\"    Frado pondered; her mistress was a professor of religion; was SHE going  to heaven? then she did not wish to go. If she should be near James,  even, she could not be happy with those fiery eyes watching her  ascending path. She resolved to give over all thought of the future  world, and strove daily to put her anxiety far from her.    Mr. Bellmont found himself unable to do what James or Jack could  accomplish for her. He talked with her seriously, told her he had seen  her many times punished undeservedly; he did not wish to have her saucy  or disrespectful, but when she was SURE she did not deserve a whipping,  to avoid it if she could. \"You are looking sick,\" he added, \"you cannot  endure beating as you once could.\"    It was not long before an opportunity offered of profiting by his  advice. She was sent for wood, and not returning as soon as Mrs. B.  calculated, she followed her, and, snatching from the pile a stick,  raised it over her.    \"Stop!\" shouted Frado, \"strike me, and I'll never work a mite more for  you;\" and throwing down what she had gathered, stood like one who feels  the stirring of free and independent thoughts.    By this unexpected demonstration, her mistress, in amazement, dropped  her weapon, desisting from her purpose of chastisement. Frado walked  towards the house, her mistress following with the wood she herself was  sent after. She did not know, before, that she had a power to ward off  assaults. Her triumph in seeing her enter the door with HER burden,  repaid her for much of her former suffering.    It was characteristic of Mrs. B. never to rise in her majesty, unless  she was sure she should be victorious.    This affair never met with an \"after clap,\" like many others.    Thus passed a year. The usual amount of scolding, but fewer whippings.  Mrs. B. longed once more for Mary's return, who had been absent over a  year; and she wrote imperatively for her to come quickly to her. A  letter came in reply, announcing that she would comply as soon as she  was sufficiently recovered from an illness which detained her.    No serious apprehensions were cherished by either parent, who constantly  looked for notice of her arrival, by mail. Another letter brought  tidings that Mary was seriously ill; her mother's presence was  solicited.    She started without delay. Before she reached her destination, a letter  came to the parents announcing her death.    No sooner was the astounding news received, than Frado rushed into Aunt  Abby's, exclaiming:--    \"She's dead, Aunt Abby!\"    \"Who?\" she asked, terrified by the unprefaced announcement.    \"Mary; they've just had a letter.\"    As Mrs. B. was away, the brother and sister could freely sympathize, and  she sought him in this fresh sorrow, to communicate such solace as she  could, and to learn particulars of Mary's untimely death, and assist him  in his journey thither.    It seemed a thanksgiving to Frado. Every hour or two she would pop in  into Aunt Abby's room with some strange query:    \"She got into the RIVER again, Aunt Abby, didn't she; the Jordan is a  big one to tumble into, any how. S'posen she goes to hell, she'll be as  black as I am. Wouldn't mistress be mad to see her a nigger!\" and others  of a similar stamp, not at all acceptable to the pious, sympathetic  dame; but she could not evade them.    The family returned from their sorrowful journey, leaving the dead  behind. Nig looked for a change in her tyrant; what could subdue her, if  the loss of her idol could not?    Never was Mrs. B. known to shed tears so profusely, as when she  reiterated to one and another the sad particulars of her darling's  sickness and death. There was, indeed, a season of quiet grief; it was  the lull of the fiery elements. A few weeks revived the former tempests,  and so at variance did they seem with chastisement sanctified, that  Frado felt them to be unbearable. She determined to flee. But where? Who  would take her? Mrs. B. had always represented her ugly. Perhaps every  one thought her so. Then no one would take her. She was black, no one  would love her. She might have to return, and then she would be more in  her mistress' power than ever.    She remembered her victory at the wood-pile. She decided to remain to do  as well as she could; to assert her rights when they were trampled on;  to return once more to her meeting in the evening, which had been  prohibited. She had learned how to conquer; she would not abuse the  power while Mr. Bellmont was at home.    But had she not better run away? Where? She had never been from the  place far enough to decide what course to take. She resolved to speak to  Aunt Abby. SHE mapped the dangers of her course, her liability to fail  in finding so good friends as John and herself. Frado's mind was busy  for days and nights. She contemplated administering poison to her  mistress, to rid herself and the house of so detestable a plague.    But she was restrained by an overruling Providence; and finally decided  to stay contentedly through her period of service, which would expire  when she was eighteen years of age.    In a few months Jane returned home with her family, to relieve her  parents, upon whom years and affliction had left the marks of age. The  years intervening since she had left her home, had, in some degree,  softened the opposition to her unsanctioned marriage with George. The  more Mrs. B. had about her, the more energetic seemed her directing  capabilities, and her fault-finding propensities. Her own, she had full  power over; and Jane after vain endeavors, became disgusted, weary, and  perplexed, and decided that, though her mother might suffer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],[0,"Travels in West Africa: Congo Français, Corisco and Cameroons (#11)"],[1,"not, however, imagine that the Bubi is neglectful of his  personal appearance.  In his way he is quite a dandy.  But his idea  of decoration goes in the direction of a plaster of \"tola\" pomatum  over his body, and above all a hat.  This hat may be an antique  European one, or a bound-round handkerchief, but it is more  frequently a confection of native manufacture, and great taste and  variety are displayed in its make.  They are of plaited palm leaf--  that's all you can safely generalise regarding them--for sometimes  they have broad brims, sometimes narrow, sometimes no brims at all.  So, too, with the crown.  Sometimes it is thick and domed, sometimes  non-existent, the wearer's hair aglow with red-tail parrots'  feathers sticking up where the crown should be.  As a general rule  these hats are much adorned with oddments of birds' plumes, and one  chief I knew had quite a Regent-street Dolly Varden creation which  he used to affix to his wool in a most intelligent way with bonnet-  pins made of wood.  These hats are also a peculiarity of the Bubi,  for none of the mainlanders care a row of pins for hats, except \"for  dandy,\" to wear occasionally, whereas the Bubi wears his  perpetually, although he has by no means the same amount of sun to  guard against owing to the glorious forests of his island.    For earrings the Bubi wears pieces of wood stuck through the lobe of  the ear, and although this is not a decorative habit still it is  less undecorative than that of certain mainland friends of mine in  this region, who wear large and necessarily dripping lumps of fat in  their ears and in their hair.  His neck is hung round with jujus on  strings--bits of the backbones of pythons, teeth, feathers, and  antelope horns, and occasionally a bit of fat in a bag.  Round his  upper arm are bracelets, preferably made of ivory got from the  mainland, for celluloid bracelets carefully imported for his benefit  he refuses to look at.  Often these bracelets are made of beads, or  a circlet of leaves, and when on the war-path an armlet of twisted  grass is always worn by the men.  Men and women alike wear armlets,  and in the case of the women they seem to be put on when young, for  you see puffs of flesh growing out from between them.  They are not  entirely for decoration, serving also as pockets, for under them men  stick a knife, and women a tobacco pipe, a well-coloured clay.  Leglets of similar construction are worn just under the knee on the  right leg, while around the body you see belts of tshibbu, small  pieces cut from Achatectonia shells, which form the native currency  of the island.  These shells are also made into veils worn by the  women at their wedding.    This native coinage-equivalent is very interesting, for such things  are exceedingly rare in West Africa.  The only other instance I  personally know of a tribe in this part of the world using a native-  made coin is that of the Fans, who use little bundles of imitation  axe-heads.  Dr. Oscar Baumann, who knows more than any one else  about these Bubis, thinks, I believe, that these bits of  Achatectonia shells may have been introduced by the runaway Angola  slaves in the old days, who used to fly from their Portuguese owners  on San Thome to the Spaniards on Fernando Po.  The villages of the  Bubis are in the forest in the interior of the island, and they are  fairly wide apart.  They are not a sea-beach folk, although each  village has its beach, which merely means the place to which it  brings its trade, these beaches being usually the dwelling places of  the so-called Portos, {51} negroes, who act as middle-men between  the Bubis and the whites.    You will often be told that the Bubis are singularly bad house-  builders, indeed that they make no definite houses at all, but only  rough shelters of branches.  This is, however, a mistake.  Shelters  of this kind that you come across are merely the rough huts put up  by hunters, not true houses.  The village is usually fairly well  built, and surrounded with a living hedge of stakes.  The houses  inside this are four-cornered, the walls made of logs of wood stuck  in edgeways, and surmounted by a roof of thatch pitched at an  extremely stiff angle, and the whole is usually surrounded with a  dug-out drain to carry off surface water.  These houses, as usual on  the West Coast, are divisible into two classes--houses of assembly,  and private living houses.  The first are much the larger.  The  latter are very low, and sometimes ridiculously small, but still  they are houses and better than those awful Loango grass affairs you  get on the Congo.    Herr Baumann says that the houses high up on the mountain have  double walls between which there is a free space; an arrangement  which may serve to minimise the extreme draughtiness of an ordinary  Bubi house--a very necessary thing in these relatively chilly upper  regions.  I may remark on my own account that the Bubi villages do  not often lie right on the path, but, like those you have to deal  with up the Calabar, some little way off it.  This is no doubt for  the purpose of concealing their whereabouts from strangers, and it  does it successfully too, for many a merry hour have I spent dodging  up and down a path trying to make out at what particular point it  was advisable to dive into the forest thicket to reach a village.  But this cultivates habits of observation, and a short course of  this work makes you recognise which tree is which along miles of a  bush path as easily as you would shops in your own street at home.    The main interest of the Bubi's life lies in hunting, for he is more  of a sportsman than the majority of mainlanders.  He has not any big  game to deal with, unless we except pythons--which attain a great  size on the island--and crocodiles.  Elephants, though plentiful on  the adjacent mainland, are quite absent from Fernando Po, as are  also hippos and the great anthropoid apes; but of the little  gazelles, small monkeys, porcupines, and squirrels he has a large  supply, and in the rivers a very pretty otter (Lutra poensis) with  yellow brown fur often quite golden underneath; a creature which is,  I believe, identical with the Angola otter.    The Bubis use in their hunting flint-lock guns, but chiefly traps  and nets, and, I am told, slings.  The advantage of these latter  methods are, I expect, the same as on the mainland, where a  distinguished sportsman once told me:  \"You go shoot thing with gun.  Berrah well--but you no get him thing for sure.  No, sah.  Dem gun  make nize.  Berrah well.  You fren hear dem nize and come look him,  and you hab to go share what you done kill.  Or bad man hear him  nize, and he come look him, and you no fit to get share--you fit to  get kill yusself.  Chii! chii! traps be best.\"  I urged that the  traps might also be robbed.  \"No, sah,\" says he, \"them bian (charm)  he look after them traps, he fit to make man who go tief swell up  and bust.\"    The Bubis also fish, mostly by basket traps, but they are not  experts either in this or in canoe management.  Their chief sea-  shore sport is hunting for the eggs of the turtles who lay in the  sand from August to October.  These eggs--about 200 in each nest--  are about the size of a billiard-ball, with a leathery envelope, and  are much valued for food, as are also the grubs of certain beetles  got from the stems of the palm-trees, and the honey of the wild bees  which abound here.    Their domestic animals are the usual African list; cats, dogs,  sheep, goats, and poultry.  Pigs there are too, very domestic in  Clarence and in a wild state in the forest.  These pigs are the  descendants of those imported by the Spaniards, and not long ago  became such an awful nuisance in Clarence that the Government issued  instructions that all pigs without rings in their noses--i.e. all in  a condition to grub up back gardens--should be forthwith shot if  found abroad.  This proclamation was issued by the governmental  bellman thus: --\"I say--I say--I say--I say.  Suppose pig walk--iron  no live for him nose!  Gun shoot.  Kill him one time.  Hear re! hear  re!\"    However a good many pigs with no iron living in their noses got  adrift and escaped into the interior, and have flourished like the  green bay-tree, destroying the Bubi's plantation and eating his  yams, while the Bubi retaliating kills and eats them.  So it's a  drawn battle, for the Bubi enjoys the pig and the pig enjoys the  yams, which are of singular excellence in this island and celebrated  throughout the Bight.  Now, I am told, the Government are firmly  discouraging the export of these yams, which used to be quite a  little branch of Fernando Po trade, in the hope that this will  induce the native to turn his attention to working in the coffee and  cacao plantations.  Hope springs eternal in the human breast, for  the Bubi has shown continually since the 16th century that he takes  no interest in these things whatsoever.  Now and again a man or  woman will come voluntarily and take service in Clarence, submit to  clothes, and rapidly pick up the ways of a house or store.  And just  when their owner thinks he owns a treasure, and begins to boast that  he has got an exception to all Bubidom, or else that he knows how to  manage them better than other men, then a hole in that man's  domestic arrangements suddenly appears.  The Bubi has gone, without  giving a moment's warning, and without stealing his master's  property, but just softly and silently vanished away.  And if hunted  up the treasure will be found in his or her particular village--  clothes-less, comfortable, utterly unconcerned, and unaware that he  or she has lost anything by leaving Clarence and Civilisation.  It  is this conduct that gains for the Bubi the reputation of being a  bigger idiot than he really is.    For West Africans their agriculture is of a fairly high description-  -the noteworthy point about it, however, is"]]]
