[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Water Analogue for Electric Pressure.]    [Illustration: original (C) Underwood and Underwood. First Wireless  College in the World, at Tufts College, Mass.]    Now if you fill the upper tank with water and the valve is turned off,  no water can flow into the lower tank but there is a difference of  pressure between them, and the moment you turn the valve on a current  of water will flow through the pipe. In very much the same way when  you have a condenser charged with electricity the latter will be under  _pressure,_ that is, a _difference of potential_ will be set up, for  one of the sheets of metal will be charged positively and the other  one, which is insulated from it, will be charged negatively, as shown  at B. On closing the switch the opposite charges rush together and  form a current which flows to and fro between the metal plates.  [Footnote: Strictly speaking it is the difference of potential that  sets up the electromotive force.]    The Electric Current and Its Circuit.--Just as water flowing through a  pipe has _quantity_ and _pressure_ back of it and the pipe offers  friction to it which tends to hold back the water, so, likewise, does  electricity flowing in a circuit have: (1) _quantity_, or _current  strength_, or just _current_, as it is called for short, or  _amperage_, and (2) _pressure_, or _potential difference_, or  _electromotive force_, or _voltage_, as it is variously called, and  the wire, or circuit, in which the current is flowing has (3)  _resistance_ which tends to hold back the current.    A definite relation exists between the current and its electromotive  force and also between the current, electromotive force and the  resistance of the circuit; and if you will get this relationship  clearly in your mind you will have a very good insight into how direct  and alternating currents act. To keep a quantity of water flowing in a  loop of pipe, which we will call the circuit, pressure must be applied  to it and this may be done by a rotary pump as shown at A in Fig. 29;  in the same way, to keep a quantity of electricity flowing in a loop  of wire, or circuit, a battery, or other means for generating electric  pressure must be used, as shown at B.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Water Analogues for Direct and Alternating  Currents.]    If you have a closed pipe connected with a piston pump, as at C, as  the piston moves to and fro the water in the pipe will move first one  way and then the other. So also when an alternating current generator  is connected to a wire circuit, as at D, the current will flow first  in one direction and then in the other, and this is what is called an  _alternating current_.    Current and the Ampere.--The amount of water flowing in a closed pipe  is the same at all parts of it and this is also true of an electric  current, in that there is exactly the same quantity of electricity at  one point of the circuit as there is at any other.    The amount of electricity, or current, flowing in a circuit in a  second is measured by a unit called the _ampere_, [Footnote: For  definition of _ampere_ see _Appendix._] and it is expressed by the  symbol I. [Footnote: This is because the letter C is used for the  symbol of _capacitance_] Just to give you an idea of the quantity of  current an _ampere_ is we will say that a dry cell when fresh gives a  current of about 20 amperes. To measure the current in amperes an  instrument called an _ammeter_ is used, as shown at A in Fig. 30, and  this is always connected in _series_ with the line, as shown at B.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--How the Ammeter and Voltmeter are Used.]    Electromotive Force and the Volt.--When you have a pipe filled with  water or a circuit charged with electricity and you want to make them  flow you must use a pump in the first case and a battery or a dynamo  in the second case. It is the battery or dynamo that sets up the  electric pressure as the circuit itself is always charged with  electricity.    The more cells you connect together in _series_ the greater will be  the electric pressure developed and the more current it will move  along just as the amount of water flowing in a pipe can be increased  by increasing the pressure of the pump. The unit of electromotive  force is the _volt_, and this is the electric pressure which will  force a current of _1 ampere_ through a resistance of _1 ohm_; it is  expressed by the symbol _E_. A fresh dry cell will deliver a current  of about 1.5 volts. To measure the pressure of a current in volts an  instrument called a _voltmeter_ is used, as shown at C in Fig. 30, and  this is always connected across the circuit, as shown at D.    Resistance and the Ohm.--Just as a water pipe offers a certain amount  of resistance to the flow of water through it, so a circuit opposes  the flow of electricity in it and this is called _resistance_.  Further, in the same way that a small pipe will not allow a large  amount of water to flow through it, so, too, a thin wire limits the  flow of the current in it.    If you connect a _resistance coil_ in a circuit it acts in the same  way as partly closing the valve in a pipe, as shown at A and B in Fig.  31. The resistance of a circuit is measured by a unit called the  _ohm_, and it is expressed by the symbol _R_. A No. 10, Brown and  Sharpe gauge soft copper wire, 1,000 feet long, has a resistance of  about 1 ohm. To measure the resistance of a circuit an apparatus  called a _resistance bridge is used_. The resistance of a circuit can,  however, be easily calculated, as the following shows.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Water Valve Analogue of Electric Resistance.  A- a valve limits the flow of water. B- a resistance limits the flow  of current.]    What Ohm's Law Is.--If, now, (1) you know what the current flowing in  a circuit is in _amperes_, and the electromotive force, or pressure,  is in _volts_, you can then easily find what the resistance is in  _ohms_ of the circuit in which the current is flowing by this formula:         Volts                   E      --------- = Ohms,  or   --- = R       Amperes                 I    That is, if you divide the current in amperes by the electromotive  force in volts the quotient will give you the resistance in ohms.    Or (2) if you know what the electromotive force of the current is in  _volts_ and the resistance of the circuit is in _ohms_ then you can  find what the current flowing in the circuit is in _amperes_, thus:        Volts                   E      ----- = Amperes,  or   --- = I      Ohms                    R    That is, by dividing the resistance of the circuit in ohms, by the  electromotive force of the current you will get the amperes flowing in  the circuit.    Finally (3) if you know what the resistance of the circuit is in  _ohms_ and the current is in _amperes_ then you can find what the  electromotive force is in _volts_ since:        Ohms x Amperes = Volts,  or   R x I = E    That is, if you multiply the resistance of the circuit in ohms by the  current in amperes the result will give you the electromotive force in  volts.    From this you will see that if you know the value of any two of the  constants you can find the value of the unknown constant by a simple  arithmetical process. This relation between these three constants is  known as _Ohm's Law_ and as they are very important you should  memorize them.    What the Watt and Kilowatt Are.--Just as _horsepower_ or _H.P._, is  the unit of work that steam has done or can do, so the _watt_ is the  unit of work that an electric current has done or can do. To find the  _watts_ a current develops you need only to multiply the _amperes_ by  the _volts_. There are _746 watts_ to _1 horsepower, and 1,000 watts  are equal to 1 kilowatt_.    Electromagnetic Induction.--To show that a current of electricity sets  up a magnetic field around it you have only to hold a compass over a  wire whose ends are connected with a battery when the needle will  swing at right angles to the length of the wire. By winding an  insulated wire into a coil and connecting the ends of the latter with  a battery you will find, if you test it with a compass, that the coil  is magnetic.    This is due to the fact that the energy of an electric current flowing  in the wire is partly changed into magnetic lines of force which  rotate at right angles about it as shown at A in Fig. 32. The  magnetic field produced by the current flowing in the coil is  precisely the same as that set up by a permanent steel magnet.  Conversely, when a magnetic line of force is set up a part of its  energy goes to make up electric currents which whirl about in a like  manner, as shown at B.    [Illustration: (A) and (B) Fig. 32.--How an Electric Current is  Changed into Magnetic Lines of Force and These into an Electric  Current.]    [Illustration: (C) and (D) Fig. 32.--How an Electric Current Sets up a  Magnetic Field.]    Self-induction or Inductance.--When a current is made to flow in a  coil of wire the magnetic lines of force produced are concentrated, as  at C, just as a lens concentrates rays of light, and this forms an  intense _magnetic field_, as it is called. Now if a bar of soft iron  is brought close to one end of the coil of wire, or, better still, if  it is pushed into the coil, it will be magnetized by _electromagnetic  induction,_ see D, and it will remain a magnet until the current is  cut off.    Mutual Induction.--When two loops of wire, or better, two coils of  wire, are placed close together the electromagnetic induction between  them is reactive, that is, when a current is made to flow through one  of the coils closed magnetic lines of force are set up and when these  cut the other loop or turns of wire of the other coil, they in turn  produce electric currents in it.    It is the mutual induction that takes place between two coils of wire  which makes it possible to transform _low"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6948"],[0,"The Secrets of the German War Office (#11)"],[1," for me and I was confronted with a human  situation which I must in this narrative of Secret Service operations  treat as impersonal though it is full of pathetic implications.  I  found her with her luggage packed.    \"Why haven't you come to the Folies lately?\" she demanded with a  pretty air of bossing the situation.    I told her my work at the hospital had made heavy inroads upon my  time.    \"Oh!\" she began, tapping a little boot impatiently on the floor; after  a pause, \"I have to leave for Paris.  .  .  .  Well?\"    \"That is most unfortunate.\"    \"Is that all?\"    \"To say anything more would only be painful, Machere Cecelia.\"    \"But there is no need of our being blue.  Why not make the occasion a  happy one?  Why not come along to Paris?\"    She looked up at me with an impudent little smile.    \"My dear little girl,\" I said, \"I am no man of means and I cannot go  gadding about Europe.  Besides, I have my work here.  I will be busy  at the hospital for another month.\"    That seemed to displease her.  She looked at me carefully,  unconsciously her manner changed.  She became somewhat appraising.  It  seemed as though a different woman was speaking,    \"Franz,\" she said, \"a man like you is wasting his time pottering  around a hospital with your evident knowledge of the world and people.  With your education and travels you ought to be very valuable to  certin men back in Paris.\"    I felt what was coming, but I asked her to explain.  She did so and  from her I received a tentative offer to enter the French Secret  Service.  I had difficulty in mastering the muscles of my face to keep  from betraying the laughter that was almost ready to break out.  Very  gravely I asked her to tell me more about Secret Service.  Proudly,  Cecelia showed me letters that she had received from Paris.  From the  addresses and the signatures I thus learned the individuals in direct  control of the system that was undermining German influence by using  demi-mondaines such as Mlle.  Balniaux.  I gathered that Cecelia  Coursan was only a go-between for Mlle.  Balniaux in making her  reports to the French government.  I asked her some more questions,  exclaiming that her proposal interested me tremendously.    I pretended to be particularly anxious as to what pay I would receive  were I to come to an understanding with \"her friend in Paris.\"  She  assured me it was liberal and urged me to hasten to Paris.  I told her  that as soon as I finished my work at the hospitals I would do so.  She then asked me to take charge of her mail and to forward any  letters that might come for her.  I did--to the Wilhelmstrasse.    That incident is one of those in my Secret Service work of which I am  not entirely proud.  Of course from my viewpoint Cecelia Coursan was  not a woman, she was simply the paid agent of another government and  it was a case of her wits against mine; at least with this sophistry I  quieted my doubts.    Three years later I found the same little woman in an obscure cafe in  Antwerp.  She was no longer in the French Service.  I concluded that  her blunder in Constantinople had \"broken\" her, for she seemed to have  gone down the ladder.  She did not recognize me, but as she seemed to  be in straitened circumstances, I found a way to assist her to at  least three months' board and lodging by sending her anonymously 500  francs.  It was conscience money.    When I had thus located and coupled up the chiefs of the French Secret  Service with the situation in Constantinople, I began quietly to  cultivate the acquaintance of the average Turkish officer.  I had to  learn the tendency of their thoughts.  I met officers and merchants,  administrators and students.  From them all I learned that they were  sick of the intrigues and wire-pulling of the harems.  I learned of  the discontent of the Young Turk party.  I gathered that the time was  ripe for an overturning of the government.  In my report I made a  correct forecast of the trend of affairs.  I drew attention to Enver  Bey, who was even then considered clever, even dangerous, by the Grand  Vizier.  As a most aggressive Young Turk, they had sent him to an  obscure post in Thessalonia, but upon sounding out the younger  officers I found that he was still regarded highly.  Without doubt my  reports in addition to the reports made by von der Golz, the  accredited German instructor of the Turkish Army, helped to shape the  policy of the German Foreign Office.  I learned beyond all doubt that  the Sultan Abdul Hamid was nothing but a figurehead, that the Grand  Vizier, bought by Russian and French gold, was running the government  in a way that was antagonistic to German influences and that the  swarms of demi-mondaines in French and Russian pay were corrupting the  higher Turkish officials to their cause.  All these things I included  in my report and after four months I was back in Berlin.    To better understand the diplomatic significance of this mission, I  shall recast the political situation.  The modern German policy in the  European Orient, inaugurated by Bismarck as a defense and check  against Russia, has always been keen on the friendship and good will  of the Turk for reasons which will be obvious enough later.  During  the Caprivi Chancellorship, the relation between the two empires  became rather lax.  Wilhelm II with his keen farsightedness set about  to remedy this.  In his usual spectacular, but in most cases  efficient, manner, he went with his royal consort in state to  Palestine, calling first on the Sultan.  The tremendously enthusiastic  reception that the Moslem countries accorded him is a matter of  contemporary history.  This was really a master stroke of diplomacy  although sharply criticised at the time.    Until the Kaiser's visit, France, with more or less right, considered  herself protector general of all Mohammedans.  From now on this began  to change.  The immediate result of the Emperor's visit was a close  understanding between the Wilhelmstrasse and the Sublime Porte.  The  buying of vast quantities of guns, ammunition, and the influx of  Prussian officers and drilling instructions, besides huge orders of  all sorts of German goods was significant.    The always uneasy jealousy of France and Russia was at once aroused,  England, in this instance, not taking any decided stand in affairs.  England had spent many lives and much money, notably in the Crimean  War, to keep Russia out of Turkey and was averse to encouraging  Russo-French influences at the Sublime Porte.  How far England would  like either Germany or France to acquire control of the Dardanelles  remains to be seen.  With Russia, it has been bloody wars and grim  struggles since the days of Catherine, misnamed the Great, to  gaincontrol of the Dardanelles.  Unceasing intrigues have been and are  still going on in Stamboul.  Russia's influence has been steadily  undermined by Germany, in Turkey and Asia Minor.  Since the disastrous  campaign against Japan, Russia has made strenuous efforts to recoup  her sphere of influence through her coalition of the principal Balkan  States.  Of this you will learn later.    Germany, always including Austria (the external policy of both  countries on all these questions is synonymous), found French-Russian  influences at work.  Through their marvelous, efficient Intelligence  System, Germany soon learned who were the prime movers and puppets; in  this instance the Grand Vizier and the Seraglio officers; the then  sultan, Abdul Hammid, \"The Damned,\" being completely cowed and under  the thumb of his Grand Vizier, could not be relied on for a moment.  After my mission they knew in Germany that the time was ripe for a  radical change, and they engineered it.  Result: A revolution and the  Young Turks in power, with Enver Bey, Tuofick Pasha, Ibrahim Mander  Bey and similar men, with German training and learning, directing  affairs.  Germany regained complete sway and is to-day easily the most  powerful influence in Turkey.  What significance this has on the  general bearing of European politics, I shall discuss in a later  chapter.      Chapter V. The Grand Duke's Letter    After a number of more or less strenuous missions, I felt thoroughly  run down.  During the Boer War I had been shot through the left lung  and now I began to experience trouble.  A series of hemorrhages  brought about by unchecked cold and exposure, led me to consult  Professor Bayer, the noted specialist in Berlin.  He advised me to get  away from everything for a month at least, recommending the pine  ozone.    There is no lack of pine forests in Germany or Norway; and I had  plenty of acquaintances in both countries.  To any one of them I would  have been welcome, but this would have entailed social obligations and  I wanted to be absolutely alone.  There were but two of my friends at  whose places I could do exactly as I wished, where man and beast knew  me.  One, whose place was in the Pushta, Hungary, was probably away on  a hunting trip and Hungary was too remote.  The other, a schoolmate of  mine, lived near Furstenwalde, about fifty-eight kilometers from  Berlin.  Furstenwalde, I decided, was an ideal spot, near Berlin, yet  isolated enough and in the heart of one of the largest of the  well-cared-for Prussian domain forests.  So Ehrenkrug, the seat of the  _Koenigliche Ober Forsterei_ and the family seat of the Freiherren von  Ehrenkrug, was the place I selected.    I had enjoyed three weeks of rest and quietness, doing some desultory  fishing and shooting but spending most of my time in a hammock slung  under some of the giant Fichten, when my sylvan idyl was disturbed by  the red-faced, stub-nosed post boy of the Forsterei.    He brought me a letter from Graf Wedel, an astonishing missive.    _Dear Graves:_    I hope your health has improved sufficiently for you to attend to this  matter.  Be pleased to understand that this is by no means an official  command."]]]
