Khâled Ebn Walîd being  sent by Mohammed in the eighth year of the Hejra to destroy this idol,  demolished the chapel, and cutting down this tree or image, burnt it: he also  slew the priestess, who ran out with her hair dishevelled, and her hands on  her head as a suppliant.  Yet the author who relates this, in another place  says, the chapel was pulled down, and Dhâlem himself killed by one Zohair,  because he consecrated this chapel with design to draw the pilgrims thither  from Mecca, and lessen the reputation of the Caaba.  The name of this deity is  derived from the root azza, and signifies the most mighty.     Manah was the object of worship of the tribes of Hodhail and Khazâah,7 who  dwelt between Mecca and Medina, and, as some say,8 of the tribes of Aws,  Khazraj, and Thakîf also.  This idol was a large stone,9 demolished by one  Saad, in the eighth year of the Hejra, a year so fatal to the idols of Arabia.  The name seems derived from mana, to flow, from the flowing of the blood of  the victims sacrificed to the deity; whence the valley of Mina,10 near Mecca,  had also its name, where the pilgrims at this day slay their sacrifices.1     Before we proceed to the other idols, let us take notice of five more,  which with the former three are all the Korân mentions by name, and they are  Wadd, Sawâ, Yaghûth, Yäûk, and Nasr.  These are said to have been antediluvian  idols, which Noah preached against, and were afterwards taken by the Arabs for  gods, having been men of great merit and piety in their time, whose statues  they reverenced at first with a       1  Dr. Prideaux mentions this expedition, but names only Abu Sofiân, and  mistaking the name of the idol for an appellative, supposes he went only to  disarm the Tayefians of their weapons and instruments of war.

This idol lying under water for some time  after the Deluge, was at length, it is said, discovered by the devil, and was  worshipped by those of Hodhail, who instituted pilgrimages to it.5     Yaghûth was an idol in the shape of a lion, and was the deity of the tribe  of Madhaj and others who dwelt in Yaman.6  Its name seems to be derived from  ghatha, which signifies to help.     Yäûk was worshipped by the tribe of Morâd, or, according to others, by that  of Hamadan,7 under the figure of a horse.  It is said he was a man of great  piety, and his death much regretted; whereupon the devil appeared to his  friends in a human form, and undertaking to represent him to the life,  persuaded them, by way of comfort, to place his effigies in their temples,  that they might have it in view when at their devotions.  This was done, and  seven others of extraordinary merit had the same honours shown them, till at  length their posterity made idols of them in earnest.8  The name Yäûk probably  comes from the verb âka, to prevent or avert.9     Nasr was a deity adored by the tribe of Hamyar, or at Dhû'l Khalaah in  their territories, under the image of an eagle, which the name signifies.     There are, or were, two statues at Bamiyân, a city of Cabul in the Indies,  50 cubits high, which some writers suppose to be the same with Yaghûth and  Yäûk, or else with Manah and Allât; and they also speak of a third standing  near the others, but something less, in the shape of an old woman, called  Nesrem or Nesr.  These statues were hollow within, for the secret giving of  oracles;10 but they seem to have been different from the Arabian idols.  There  was also an idol at Sûmenat in the Indies, called Lât or al Lât, whose statue  was 50 fathoms high, of a single stone, and placed in the midst of a temple  supported by 56 pillars of massy gold: this idol Mahmûd Ebn Sebecteghin, who  conquered that part of India, broke to pieces with his own hands.1     Besides the idols we have mentioned, the Arabs also worshipped great  numbers of others, which would take up too much time to have distinct accounts  given of them; and not being named in the Korân, are not so much to our  present purpose: for besides that every housekeeper had his household god or  gods, which he last took leave of and first saluted at his going abroad and  returning home,2 there were no less than 360 idols,3 equalling in number the  days of their year, in and about the Caaba of Mecca; the chief of whom was  Hobal,4 brought from Belka in Syria into Arabia by Amru Ebn Lohai, pretending  it would procure them rain when they wanted it.5  It was the statue of a man,  made of agate, which having by some accident lost a hand, the       2  Kor. c. 71.

Koreish repaired it with one of gold: he held in his hand seven arrows without  heads or feathers, such as the Arabs used in divination.6  This idol is  supposed to have been the same with the image of Abraham,7 found and destroyed  by Mohammed in the Caaba, on his entering it, in the eighth year of the Hejra,  when he took Mecca,8 and surrounded with a great number of angels and  prophets, as inferior deities; among whom, as some say, was Ismael, with  divining arrows in his hand also.9     Asâf and Nayelah, the former the image of a man, the latter of a woman,  were also two idols brought with Hobal from Syria, and placed the one on Mount  Safâ, and the other on Mount Merwa.  They tell us Asâf was the son of Amru,  and Nayelah the daughter of Sahâl, both of the tribe of Jorham, who committing  whoredom together in the Caaba, were by GOD converted into stone,10 and  afterwards worshipped by the Koreish, and so much reverenced by them, that  though this superstition was condemned by Mohammed, yet he was forced to allow  them to visit those mountains as monuments of divine justice.11     I shall mention but one idol more of this nation, and that was a lump of  dough worshipped by the tribe of Hanîfa, who used it with more respect than  the Papists do theirs, presuming not to eat it till they were compelled to it  by famine.12     Several of their idols, as Manah in particular, were no more than large  rude stones, the worship of which the posterity of Ismael first introduced;  for as they multiplied, and the territory of Mecca grew too strait for them,  great numbers were obliged to seek new abodes; and on such migrations it was  usual for them to take with them some of the stones of that reputed holy land,  and set them up in the places where they fixed; and these stones they at first  only compassed out of devotion, as they had accustomed to do the Caaba.  But  this at last ended in rank idolatry, the Ismaelites forgetting the religion  left them by their father so far as to pay divine worship to any fine stone  they met with.1     Some of the pagan Arabs believed neither a creation past, nor a  resurrection to come, attributing the origin of things to nature, and their  dissolution to age.  Others believed both, among whom were those who, when  they died, had their camel tied by their sepulchre, and so left, without meat  or drink, to perish, and accompany them to the other world, lest they should  be obliged, at the resurrection, to go on foot, which was reckoned very  scandalous.2  Some believed a metem-psychosis, and that of the blood near the  dead person's brain was formed a bird named Hâmah, which once in a hundred  years visited the sepulchre; though others say this bird is animated by the  soul of him that is unjustly slain, and continually cries, Oscûni, Oscûni,  i.e., \"give me to drink\"-meaning of the murderer's blood-till his death be  revenged, and then it flies away.  This was forbidden by the Korân to be  believed.3     I might here mention several superstitious rites and customs of the ancient  Arabs, some of which were abolished and others retained by Mohammed; but I  apprehend it will be more convenient to take notice       6  Safio'ddin.  7  Poc.

Let us now turn our view from the idolatrous Arabs, to those among them who  had embraced more rational religions.     The Persians had, by their vicinity and frequent intercourse with the  Arabians, introduced the Magian religion among some of their tribes,  particularly that of Tamim,4 a long time before Mohammed, who was so far from  being unacquainted with that religion, that he borrowed many of his own  institutions from it, as will be observed in the progress of this work.  I  refer those who are desirous to have some notion of Magism, to Dr. Hyde's  curious account of it,5 a succinct abridgment of which may be read with much  pleasure in another learned performance.6     The Jews, who fled in great numbers into Arabia from the fearful  destruction of their country by the Romans, made proselytes of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7446"],[0,"The Naturalist in La Plata (#11)"],[1,"of Mr. E. Newman, quoted by Darwin, that  two-thirds of the humble bees in England are annually destroyed by mice,  I determined to continue observing these insects, in order to ascertain  whether the same thing occurred on the pampas. I carefully revisited all  the nests I had found, and was amazed at the rapid disappearance of all  the bees. I was quite convinced that the mice had devoured or driven  them out, for the weather was still warm, and flowers and fruit on which  humble bees feed were very abundant.    After cold weather set in the storks went away, probably on account of  the scarcity of water, for the owls remained. So numerous were they  during the winter, that any evening after sunset I could count forty or  fifty individuals hovering over the trees about my house. Unfortunately  they did not confine their attentions to the mice, but became  destructive to the birds as well. I frequently watched them at dusk,  beating about the trees and bushes in a systematic manner, often a dozen  or more of them wheeling together about one tree, like so many moths  about a candle, and one occasionally dashing through the branches until  a pigeon--usually the Zenaida maculata--or other bird was scared from  its perch. The instant the bird left the tree they would all give chase,  disappearing in the darkness. I could not endure to see the havoc they  were making amongst the ovenbirds (Furnarius rufus--a species for which  I have a regard and affection almost superstitious), so I began to shoot  the marauders. Very soon, however, I found it was impossible to protect  my little favourites. Night after night the owls mustered in their usual  numbers, so rapidly were the gaps I made in their ranks refilled. I grew  sick of the cruel war in which I had so hopelessly joined, and resolved,  not without pain, to let things take their course. A singular  circumstance was that the owls began to breed in the middle of winter.  The field-labourers and boys found many nests with eggs and young birds  in the neighbourhood. I saw one nest in July, our coldest month, with  three half-grown young birds in it. They were excessively fat, and,  though it was noon-day, had their crops full. There were three mice and  two young cavies (Cavia australis) lying untouched in the nest.    The short-eared owl is of a wandering disposition, ard performs long  journeys at all seasons of the year in search of districts where food is  abundant; and perhaps these winter-breeders came from a region where  scarcity of prey, or some such cause, had prevented them from nesting at  their usual time in summer.    The gradual increase or decrease continually going on in many species  about us is little remarked; but the sudden infrequent appearance in  vast numbers of large and comparatively rare species is regarded by most  people as a very wonderful phenomenon, not easily explained. On the  pampas, whenever grasshoppers, mice, frogs or crickets become  excessively abundant we confidently look for the appearance of  multitudes of the birds that prey on them. However obvious may be the  cause of the first phenomenon--the sudden inordinate increase during a  favourable year of a species always prolific--the attendant one always  creates astonishment: For how, it is asked, do these largo birds, seldom  seen at other times, receive information in the distant regions they  inhabit of an abundance of food in any particular locality? Years have  perhaps passed during which, scarcely an individual of these kinds has  been seen: all at once armies of the majestic white storks are seen  conspicuously marching about the plain in all directions; while the  night air resounds with the solemn hootings of innumerable owls. It is  plain that these birds have been drawn from over an immense area to one  spot; and the question is how have they been drawn?    Many large birds possessing great powers of flight are, when not  occupied with the business of propagation, incessantly wandering from  place to place in search of food. They are not, as a rule, regular  migrants, for their wanderings begin and end irrespective of seasons,  and where they find abundance they remain the whole year. They fly at a  very great height, and traverse immense distances. When the favourite  food of any one of these species is plentiful in any particular region  all the individuals that discover it remain, and attract to them all of  their kind passing overhead. This happens on the pampas with the stork,  the short-eared owl, the hooded gull and the dominican or black-backed  gull--the leading species among the feathered nomads: a few first appear  like harbingers; these are presently joined by new comers in  considerable numbers, and before long they are in myriads. Inconceivable  numbers of birds are, doubtless, in these regions, continually passing  over us unseen. It was once a subject of very great wonder to me that  flocks of black-necked swans should almost always appear flying by  immediately after a shower of rain, even when none had been visible for  a long time before, and when they must have come from a very great  distance. When the reason at length occurred to me, I felt very much  disgusted with myself for being puzzled over so very simple a matter.  After rain a flying swan may be visible to the eye at a vastly greater  distance than during fair weather; the sun shining on its intense white  plumage against the dark background of a rain-cloud making it  exceedingly conspicuous. The fact that swans are almost always seen  after rain shows only that they are almost always passing.    Whenever we are visited by a dust-storm on the pampas myriads of hooded  gulls--Larus macnlipen-nis--appear flying before the dark dust-cloud,  even when not a gull has been seen for months. Dust-storms are of rare  occurrence, and come only after a long drought, and, the water-courses  being all dry, the gulls cannot have been living in the region over  which the storm passes. Yet in seasons of drought gulls must be  continually passing by at a great height, seeing but not seen, except  when driven together and forced towards the earth by the fury of the  storm.    By August (1873) the owls had vanished, and they had, indeed, good cause  for leaving. The winter had been one of continued drought; the dry grass  and herbage of the preceding year had been consumed by the cattle and  wild animals, or had turned to dust, and with the disappearance of their  food and cover the mice had ceased to be. The famine-stricken cats  sneaked back to the house. It was pitiful to see the little burrowing  owls; for these birds, not having the powerful wings and prescient  instincts of the vagrant Otus brachyotus, are compelled to face the  poverty from which the others escape. Just as abundance had before made  the domestic cats wild, scarcity now made the burrowing owls tame and  fearless of man. They were so reduced as scarcely to be able to fly, and  hung about the houses all day long on the look-out for some stray morsel  of food. I have frequently seen one alight and advance within two or  three yards of the door-step, probably attracted by the smell of roasted  meat. The weather continued dry until late in spring, so reducing the  sheep and cattle that incredible numbers perished during a month of cold  and rainy weather that followed the drought.    How clearly we can see in all this that the tendency to multiply  rapidly, so advantageous in normal seasons, becomes almost fatal to a  species in seasons of exceptional abundance. Cover and food without  limit enabled the mice to increase at such an amazing rate that the  lesser checks interposed by predatory species were for a while  inappreciable. But as the mice increased, so did their enemies.  Insectivorous and other species acquired the habits of owls and weasels,  preying exclusively on them; while to this innumerable army of residents  was shortly added multitudes of wandering birds coming from distant  regions. No sooner had the herbage perished, depriving the little  victims of cover and food, than the effects of the war became apparent.  In autumn the earth so teemed with them that one could scarcely walk  anywhere without treading on mice; while out of every hollow weed-stalk  lying on the ground dozens could be shaken; but so rapidly had they  devoured, by the trained army of persecutors, that in spring it was hard  to find a survivor, even in the barns and houses. The fact that species  tend to increase in a geometrical ratio makes these great and sudden  changes frequent in many regions of the earth; but it is not often they  present themselves so vividly as in the foregoing instance, for here,  scene after scene in one of Nature's silent passionless tragedies opens  before us, countless myriads of highly organized beings rising into  existence only to perish almost immediately, scarcely a hard-pressed  remnant remaining after the great reaction to continue the species.          CHAPTER IV.    SOME CURIOUS ANIMAL WEAPONS.      Strictly speaking, the only weapons of vertebrates are teeth, claws,  horns, and spurs. Horns belong only to the ruminants, and the spur is a  rare weapon. There are also many animals in which teeth and claws are  not suited to inflict injury, or in which the proper instincts and  courage to use and develop them are wanted; and these would seem, to be  in a very defenceless condition. Defenceless they are in one sense, but  as a fact they are no worse off than the well-armed species, having  either a protective colouring or a greater swiftness or cunning to  assist them in escaping from their enemies. And there are also many of  these practically toothless and clawless species which have yet been  provided with other organs and means of offence and defence out of  Nature's curious armoury, and concerning a few of these species I  propose to speak in this place.    Probably such distinctive weapons as horns, spurs, "]]]
