To commemorate their obedience the Mosque was called  Al-Kiblatayn.  [FN#33] I cannot say whether this valuable stone be still at the Mosque  Benu Tifr. But I perfectly remember that my friend Larking had a  mutilated sphynx in his garden at Alexandria, which was found equally  efficacious.  [FN#34] See chapter xvii.  [FN#35] Mohammeds eldest son was Kasim, who died in his infancy, and was  buried at Meccah. Hence the Prophets pædonymic, Abu Kasim, the sire of  Kasim.  [FB#36] Ayishah used to relate that she was exceedingly jealous of the  Coptic girls beauty, and of the Prophets love for her. Mohammed seeing  this, removed Mariyah from the house of Harisat bin al-Numan, in which  he had placed her, to the Awali of Al-Madinah, where the Mosque now is.  Oriental authors use this term Awali, high-grounds, to denote the plains  to the Eastward and Southward of the City, opposed to Al-Safilah, the  lower ground on the W. and N.W.

THE Damascus Caravan was to set out on the 27th Zul Kaadah (1st  September). I had intended to stay at Al-Madinah till the last moment,  and to accompany the Kafilat al-Tayyarah, or the Flying Caravan, which  usually leaves on the 2nd Zul Hijjah, two days after that of Damascus.    Suddenly arose the rumour that there would be no Tayyarah,[FN#l] and  that all pilgrims must proceed with the Damascus Caravan or await the  Rakb. This is a Dromedary Caravan, in which each person carries only  his saddle-bags. It usually descends by the road called Al-Khabt, and  makes Meccah on the fifth day. The Sharif Zayd, Saad the Robbers only  friend, had paid him an unsuccessful visit. Schinderhans demanded back  his Shaykh-ship, in return for a safe-conduct through his country:  Otherwise, said he, I will cut the throat of every hen that ventures into  the passes.    The Sharif Zayd returned to Al-Madinah on the 25th Zul Kaadah (30th  August). Early on the morning of the next day, Shaykh Hamid returned  hurriedly from the bazar, exclaiming, You must make ready at once,  Effendi!there will be no Tayyarahall Hajis start to-morrowAllah will make  it easy to you!have you    [p.51] your water-skins in order?you are to travel down the Darb  al-Sharki, where you will not see water for three days!    Poor Hamid looked horrorstruck as he concluded this fearful  announcement, which filled me with joy. Burckhardt had visited and had  described the Darb al-Sultani, the road along the coast. But no  European had as yet travelled down by Harun al-Rashids and the Lady  Zubaydahs celebrated route through the Nijd Desert.    Not a moment, however, was to be lost: we expected to start early the  next morning. The boy Mohammed went forth, and bought for eighty  piastres a Shugduf, which lasted us throughout the pilgrimage, and for  fifteen piastres a Shibriyah or cot to be occupied by Shaykh Nur, who  did not relish sleeping on boxes. The youth was employed all day, with  sleeves tucked up, and working like a porter, in covering the litter  with matting and rugs, in mending broken parts, and in providing it  with large pockets for provisions inside and outside, with pouches to  contain the gugglets of cooled water.    Meanwhile Shaykh Nur and I, having inspected the water-skins, found  that the rats had made considerable rents in two of them. There being  no workman procurable at this time for gold, I sat down to patch the  damaged articles; whilst Nur was sent to lay in supplies for fourteen  days. The journey is calculated at eleven days; but provisions are apt  to spoil, and the Badawi camel-men expect to be fed. Besides which,  pilferers abound. By my companions advice I took wheat-flour, rice,  turmeric, onions, dates, unleavened bread of two kinds, cheese, limes,  tobacco, sugar, tea and coffee.    Hamid himself started upon the most important part of our business.  Faithful camel-men are required upon a road where robberies are  frequent and stabbings occasional, and where there is no law to prevent  desertion or to limit new and exorbitant demands. After a time he    [p.52] returned, accompanied by a boy and a Badawi, a short, thin,  well-built old man with regular features, a white beard, and a cool  clear eye; his limbs, as usual, were scarred with wounds. Masud of the  Rahlah, a sub-family of the Hamidah family of the Benu-Harb, came in  with a dignified demeanour, applied his dexter palm to ours,[FN#2] sat  down, declined a pipe, accepted coffee, and after drinking it, looked  at us to show that he was ready for nego[t]iation. We opened the  proceedings with We want men, and not camels, and the conversation  proceeded in the purest Hijazi.[FN#3] After much discussion, we agreed,  if compelled to travel by the Darb al-Sharki, to pay twenty dollars for  two camels,[FN#4] and to advance Arbun, or earnest-money, to half that  amount.[FN#5] The Shaykh bound himself to provide us with good animals,  which, moreover, were to be changed in case of accidents: he was also  to supply his beasts with water, and to accompany us to Arafat and  back. But, absolutely refusing to carry my large chest, he declared  that the tent under the Shugduf was burden enough for one camel; and  that the green box of drugs, the saddle-bags, and the provision-sacks,  surmounted by Nurs cot, were amply sufficient for the other. On our  part, we bound ourselves to feed the    [p.53] Shaykh and his son, supplying them either with raw or with  cooked provender, and, upon our return to Meccah from Mount Arafat, to  pay the remaining hire with a discretionary present.    Hamid then addressed to me flowery praises of the old Badawi. After  which, turning to the latter, he exclaimed, Thou wilt treat these  friends well, O Masud the Harbi! The ancient replied with a dignity that  had no pomposity in it,Even as Abu Shawaribthe Father of  Mustachios[FN#6]behaveth to us, so will we behave to him! He then arose,  bade us be prepared when the departure-gun sounded, saluted us, and  stalked out of the room, followed by his son, who, under pretext of  dozing, had mentally made an inventory of every article in the room,  ourselves especially included.    When the Badawin disappeared, Shaykh Hamid shook his head, advising me  to give them plenty to eat, and never to allow twenty-four hours to  elapse without dipping hand in the same dish with them, in order that  the party might always be Malihin,on terms of salt.[FN#7] He concluded    [p.54] with a copious lecture upon the villainy of Badawin, and on  their habit of drinking travellers water. I was to place the skins on a  camel in front, and not behind; to hang them with their mouths  carefully tied, and turned upwards, contrary to the general practice;  always to keep a good store of liquid, and at night to place it under  the safeguard of the tent.    In the afternoon, Omar Effendi and others dropped in to take leave.  They found me in the midst of preparations, sewing sacks, fitting up a  pipe, patching water-bags, and packing medicines. My fellow-traveller  had brought me some pencils[FN#8] and a penknife, as forget-me-nots, for  we were by no means sure of meeting again. He hinted, however, at  another escape from the paternal abode, and proposed, if possible, to  join the Dromedary-Caravan. Shaykh Hamid said the same, but I saw, by  the expression of his face, that his mother and wife would not give him  leave from home so soon after his return.    Towards evening-time the Barr al-Manakhah became a scene of exceeding  confusion. The town of tents lay upon the ground. Camels were being  laden, and were roaring under the weight of litters and cots, boxes and  baggage. Horses and mules galloped about. Men were rushing wildly in  all directions on worldly errands, or hurrying to pay a farewell visit  to the Prophets Tomb. Women and children sat screaming on the ground, or  ran to and fro distracted, or called their vehicles to escape the  danger of being crushed. Every now and then a random shot excited all  into the belief that the departure-gun had sounded. At times we heard a  volley from the robbers hills, which elicited a general groan, for the  pilgrims were still, to use their own phrase, between fear    [p.55] and hope, and, consequently, still far from one of the two  comforts.[FN#9] Then would sound the loud Jhin-Jhin of the camels bells, as  the stately animals paced away with some grandees gilt and emblazoned  litter, the sharp plaint of the dromedary, and the loud neighing of  excited steeds.    About an hour after sunset all our preparations were concluded, save  only the Shugduf, at which the boy Mohammed still worked with untiring  zeal; he wisely remembered that he had to spend in it the best portion  of a week and a half. The evening was hot, we therefore dined outside  the house. I was told to repair to the Harim for the Ziyarat al-Widaa,  or the Farewell Visitation; but my decided objection to this step was  that we were all to part,how soon!and when to meet again we knew not. My  companions smiled consent, assuring me that the ceremony could be  performed as well at a distance as in the temple.    Then Shaykh Hamid made me pray a two-bow prayer, and afterwards, facing  towards the Harim, to recite this supplication with raised hands:    O Apostle of Allah, we beg Thee to entreat Almighty Allah, that He cut  off no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4664"],[0,"Light, Life, and Love: Selections from the German Mystics of the Middle Ages (#11)"],[1,"century.]    THE FIRST WORD    NOW, O my soul, and all ye who have been redeemed by the precious  blood of Christ, come, and let us go with inward compassion and  fervent devotion to the blessed palm-tree of the Cross, which is  laden with the fairest fruit. Let us pass like the bee from flower  to flower, for all are full of honey. Let us consider and ponder  with the greatest care the sacred words of Christ, which He spoke  upon the Cross; for everything that comes From this blessed Tree is  wholesome and good. In the Cross of our Lord and Saviour are centred  all our salvation, all our health, all our life, all our glory; and,  \"if we suffer with Him,\" saith the Apostle, \"we shall also reign  with Him.\" That we may not be found ungrateful for these inestimable  benefits, let us call upon heaven and earth, and all that in them  is, to join us in praising and blessing and giving thanks to God.  Let us invite them to come and look upon this wondrous sight, and  say: \"Magnify the Lord with me, for He hath done marvellous things.  O praise and bless the Lord with me, for great is His mercy toward  us.\" Come up with me, I pray you, ye angelic spirits, to Mount  Calvary, and see your King Solomon on His throne, wearing the diadem  wherewith His mother has crowned Him. Let us weep in the presence of  the Lord who made us, the Lord our God. O all mankind, and all ye  who are members of Christ, behold your Redeemer as He hangs on high;  behold and weep. See if any sorrow is like unto His sorrow.  Acknowledge the heinousness of your sins, which needed such  satisfaction. Go to every part of His body; you will find only  wounds and blood. Cry to Him with lamentations and say, \"O Jesus,  our redemption, our love, our desire, what mercy has overcome Thee,  that Thou shouldest bear our sins, and endure a cruel death, to  rescue us from everlasting death?\" And Thou, O God, the almighty  Father of heaven, look down from Thy sanctuary upon Thine innocent  Son Joseph, sold and given over unjustly to the hands of bloody men,  to suffer a shameful death. See whether this be Thy Son's coat or  not. Of a truth an evil beast hath devoured Him. The blood of our  sins is sprinkled over His garments, and all the coverings of His  good name are defiled by it. See how Thy holy Child has been  condemned with the wicked, how Thy royal Son has been crowned with  thorns. Behold His innocent hands, which have known no sin, dripping  with blood; behold His sacred feet, which have never turned aside  from the path of justice, pierced through by a cruel nail; behold  His defenceless side smitten with a sharp spear; behold His fair  face, which the angels desire to look upon, marred and shorn of all  its beauty; behold His blessed heart, which no impure thought ever  stained, weighed down with inward sorrow. Behold, O loving Father,  Thy sweet Son, stretched out upon the harp of the Cross, and harping  blessings on Thee with all His members. Wherefore, O my God, I pray  Thee to forgive me, for the sake of Thy Son's Passion, all the sins  that I have committed in my members. O merciful Father, look on Thy  only-begotten Son, that Thou mayst have compassion on Thy servant.  Whenever that red blood of Thy Son speaks in Thy sight, do Thou wash  me from every stain of sin. Whenever Thou beholdest the wounds of  this Thy Son, open to me the bosom of Thy fatherly compassion.  Behold, O tender Father, how Thy obedient Son does not cry, \"Bind my  hands and my feet, that I may not rebel against Thee,\" but how of  His own will He extends His hands and feet, and gladly allows them  to be pierced with nails. Look down, I pray Thee, not on the brazen  serpent hanging on a pole for the salvation of Israel, but on Thine  only Son hanging on the Cross for the salvation of all men. It is  not Moses who now stretches out his hand to heaven, that the thunder  and lightning and the other plagues may cease, but it is Thy beloved  Son, who lovingly stretches out His bleeding arms to Thee, that Thy  wrath may depart from the human race. Aaron and Hur are not now  holding up the hands of Moses that he may pray more unweariedly for  Israel; but hard and cruel nails have fastened the hands of Thy only  Son to the Cross, that He may wait with long-suffering for our  repentance, and receive us back into His grace, and that He may not  turn away in wrath from our prayers. This is that faithful David,  who now strings tight the harp-strings of His body, and makes sweet  melody before Thee, singing to Thee the sweetest song that has been  ever sung to Thee: \"Father forgive them, for they know not what they  do.\" This is that High Priest, who by His own blood has entered into  the Holy of Holies, to offer Himself as a peace-offering for the  sins of the whole world. This is that innocent Lamb, who has washed  us in His own precious blood, who, Himself without spot of sin, has  taken away the sins of the world. Therefore from the storehouse of  His Passion I borrow the price of my debt, and I count out before  Thee all its merits, to pay what I owe Thee. For He has done all in  my nature, and for my sake. O merciful Father, if Thou weighest all  my sins on one side of the balance, and in the other scale the  Passion of Thy Son, the last will outweigh the first. For what sin  can be so great, that the innocent blood of Thy Son has not washed  it out? What pride, or disobedience, or lust, is so unchecked or so  rebellious, that such lowliness, obedience, and poverty cannot  abolish it? O merciful Father, accept the deeds of Thy beloved Son,  and forgive the errors of Thy wicked servant. For the innocent blood  of our brother Abel crieth to Thee from the Cross, not for  vengeance, but for grace and mercy, saying, \"Father, forgive them,  for they know not what they do.\"    THE SECOND WORD    NOW the thieves who were crucified with Jesus reviled Him. But after  a while, the one who hung on the right side of Christ, when he saw  His great patience and long-suffering, wherewith He so lovingly  prayed to His Father for those who cast reproaches upon Him and  cruelly tortured Him, became entirely changed, and began to be moved  with very great sorrow and repentance for his sins. And he showed  this outwardly, when he rebuked his fellow-thief, who continued to  revile Christ, saying: \"Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in  the same condemnation?\" \"Although\" (he would say) \"thou art so  obstinate as not to fear men, and thinkest nought of thy bodily  pain, yet surely thou must fear God, in the last moments of thy  life--God, who hath power to destroy both thy body and soul in hell.  And though we suffer the same punishment with Him, our deserts are  very different. We, indeed, suffer justly, for we receive the due  reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiss.\" He, who  but lately was a blasphemer, is now a confessor and preacher, he  distinguishes good from evil, blaming the sinner, and excusing the  innocent: the unbelieving thief has become the confessor of almighty  God. O good Jesus, this sudden change is wrought by Thy right hand,  at which he hung. Thy right hand touched him inwardly, and forthwith  he is changed into another man. O Lord, in this Thou hast declared  Thy patience, out of a stone Thou hast raised up a child unto  Abraham. Verily, the penitent thief received the light of faith  solely from that bright light on the candlestick of the Cross, which  shone there in the darkness and scattered the shades of night. But  what does this signify, save that our Lord Jesus, out of the  greatness of His goodness, looked upon him with the eyes of His  mercy, although He found no merit in him, except what it pleased Him  out of His goodness to bestow? For as God gives to His elect, out of  His goodness alone, what no one has a right to demand, so out of His  justice He gives to the wicked what they deserve. For this cause  David says: \"He saved me because He desired me.\" And this is why the  thief, before the Lord touched his heart with the beams of His grace  and love, joined the other thief in reviling Christ, thus showing  first what his own character was, and afterwards what was wrought in  him by grace. At first he acted like the other, being, like him, a  child of wrath; but when the precious blood of Christ was shed as  the price of our redemption and paid to the Father for our debt,  then the thief asked God to give him an alms for his good, and at  once received it. For how can one alms diminish that inexhaustible  treasure? How could our tender Lord, whose property is always to  have mercy, have refused his request? Indeed He gave him more than  he asked. Yet how could the thief escape the glow of the fire which  was burning so near him? Truly this was the fire, which the Father  had sent down from heaven to earth, which had long smouldered, but  now, kindled anew, and fed by the wood of the Cross, and sprinkled  with the oil of mercy, and fanned, as it were, by the reproaches and  blasphemies of the Jews, sent up its flames to heaven, by which that  thief was quite kindled and set on fire, and his love became as  strong as death, so that he said: \"I indeed suffer no grievous  penalty, for it is less than I deserve; but that this innocent One,  who has done no wrong, should be so tortured, contrary to justice  and righteousness, this, truly, adds grievous sorrow to my sorrow.\"  O splendid faith of this thief! He contemned all the punishment that  might be inflicted on him: he feared not the rage of the people, who  were barking like mad dogs against Jesus: he cared not for the chief  priests: he feared not the executioners with their weapons and  instruments of torture; but in the presence of them all, with a  fearless heart he confessed that Christ was the true Son of God, and  Lord of the whole world: and at the same time he confounded the Jews  by confessing that He had done nothing amiss, and therefore that  they had crucified Him"]]]
