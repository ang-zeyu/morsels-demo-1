Jenny was light and escaped bogging; not so Omerod, who sank  as far as his legs would allow, and there waited calmly until we had  unpacked the loads, carried them across the lake, and returned to help  Shimsha, who struggled violently in the sticky clay. When he was safely  taken across to an island on which we sought refuge, Omerod was attended  to. There he lay, half buried in salt mud, chewing his cud unconcernedly;  either he had perfect confidence in us, or was indifferent as to his  fate--he looked rather as if he were saying \"Kismet.\" We had some trouble  in digging him out, during which operation Luck fared as I had done  before; he was pinned beneath the camel, waist deep in clay, and in that  position had to emulate the stolid patience of Omerod until I could dig  him out. At last they were both free, and after considerable labour we  landed on the island, camels, baggage, and all, just as night fell.  We WERE cold too, clothes and arms and faces covered with moist salt clay,  and nothing with which to make a fire but sprigs of dead samphire. A cold  night means an early start--so we were up betimes and found that the  camels, not tied, since we thought them safe on an island, had in search  of feed hobbled across the lake, and were standing disconsolate on this  sea of mud, afraid to move now that in daylight they could see their  surroundings. A repetition of the preceding day's performance, landed us  beyond the treacherous lake-bed, and the following day we were fortunate  in finding a fine rock-hole of water, which enabled us to reappear as  white men.    Mirages are nearly always to be seen on these lakes of the interior, and  from their occurrence it is impossible to determine the extent of the flat  expanse of mud. On this occasion I witnessed the finest I have ever seen.  The hot sun playing upon the damp breeze rising from the lake, transformed  this desolate sea of salt and clay, into a charming picture. The horizon  and the sky were joined by a mirage of beautiful clear water, from which  islands and hills seemed to rise; even their shadows and those of the  trees with which they were clothed were reflected in the unruffled surface  of the lake. The long stretch of sand between, gave the picture the  appearance of a peaceful, natural harbour, which the tide was about to  fill.    We were unable to pay more than a flying visit to Mount Ida, but  sufficiently long to assure us of the auriferous character of its  neighbourhood. It is quite an imposing hill, rough, dark, and rugged, and  formed as if layers of black slate had been thrown violently against each  other. It rises some five hundred feet above the surrounding country.    We needed all our time to reach Siberia, before our provisions gave out.  There we arrived in due course, passing close, on our way, to the hills  near which Menzies afterwards made his great \"find.\"    At Siberia a Government survey party, under Messrs. Newman and Brazier,  was camped, preparatory to running a line to connect Coolgardie and the  Murchison. Bidding them adieu, we took the road to Coolgardie, and arrived  there on June 22nd after an absence of exactly ninety days, having  travelled 843 miles. The result of the journey to ourselves was nil, for  the company considered that the reef we had found was too far off, and  took no further steps to develop it. It was afterwards under offer for  13,000 pounds in cash and shares, though whether the deal came off or not,  or what the mine was worth, I am not aware.      The company's representative in Coolgardie welcomed us with great  hospitality, and invited us to tea at his camp. Here he produced whisky,  and what he told us he considered the very best of tinned meats. \"So HELP  me never, it's MINCED MUTTON!\" shouted poor Luck, as the tin was  opened--a little joke that has never been forgotten.    It is a rather novel sensation to find that you are dead; and this was  our experience, for the papers had killed us some time since--our bones  had been seen bleaching in the sun, and all that sort of thing.  Unfortunately our death was not certain enough to warrant any obituary  notices, which might have been interesting reading.    On our return to Perth, the manager of the company for which we had  worked, who had arrived in our absence, far from thanking us for having  tried our best, asked why we went into a d----d desert to look for gold!  This we considered a little mean, seeing that a great part of the country  we had traversed had been hitherto unexplored. However, one doesn't look  for thanks from a mining company. So our journey was finished--a journey  that I shall never look back upon with regret, but with pleasure, for Luck  was a fine fellow and the best of mates; and at least we had the  satisfaction of knowing that if we had been unsuccessful, it was not for  the want of trying.            PART III     SECOND PROSPECTING EXPEDITION          CHAPTER I        THE JOYS OF PORTABLE CONDENSERS      November 8, 1894, was a red-letter day in the history of Coolgardie, for  on that date the foundation-stone of the first brick building was laid by  Mr. James Shaw, the mayor. Under the stone was deposited a specimen of  each coin of the realm, and these, by the way, were purloined in the  night. This great day was made the occasion for feasting and jubilation,  the feasting taking the not uncommon form of a gigantic \"Champagne Spree,\"  to which the whole town was invited.    When once a wave of inebriety swept over the settlement, something a  little out of the ordinary was likely to occur. Fights and rows would be  started with the most bloodthirsty intentions, only to end in peace and  harmony after the swearing of eternal friendships. A good fight in  Coolgardie in those days would attract as much attention as a cab accident  in the streets of London. The well-known cry of \"A fight! a fight!\" would  bring the greater part of the population from their dwellings--from  stores, banks, offices, bars, an excited and rushing crowd would hurry  to the scene of the fray, all eager to witness a good row; they were not,  as a rule, disappointed, for, as one fight usually breeds several, a fair  afternoon's or morning's entertainment could be safely counted on.  A mining community must have excitement; even a dog-fight would command a  considerable amount of interest.    On the celebrated night of the laying of the foundation stone I had the  pleasure of witnessing a rough-and-tumble fight between two of the most  powerful men in Coolgardie. The excitement was intense as one seized his  antagonist, and, using him as a flail, proceeded to clear the room with  him; he retaliated by overpowering the other man, and finally breaking his  leg as they fell heavily together out through the door on to the hard  street beyond. How much ill-feeling this little incident engendered may be  judged from the fact that the maimed man was employed by his late  adversary as clerk until his limb mended, and subsequently held the billet  for many months.    It was my misfortune to be engaged in organising a prospecting expedition  at this time--misfortune, because of the impossibility of getting any one  to attend to business. Camels had to be bought, and provisions and  equipment attended to. A syndicate had engaged my services and those of  my two companions whom I had chosen in Perth: Jim Conley, a fine, sturdy  American from Kentucky, the one; and Paddy Egan, an Irish-Victorian, the  other. Both had been some time on the fields, and Conley had had previous  experience in South Africa and on the Yukon, where he had negotiated the  now famous Chilcoot Pass without realising that it was the tremendous feat  that present-day travellers represent it to be.    There are few men more entertaining than diggers, when one can get them to  talk; there is hardly a corner of the habitable globe to which they have  not penetrated. Round a camp-fire one will hear tales of Africa, New  Guinea, New Zealand, Australia, America from Alaska to the Horn,  Madagascar, and other strange countries that would be a mine of  information to a writer of books of adventure--tales told in the main with  truth and accuracy, and in the quiet, unostentatious manner of the  habitual digger to whom poverty, riches, and hardships come all in their  turn as a matter of course.    Having chosen my mates, the next thing to be done was to procure beasts of  burden. Of numerous camels submitted for inspection I took three, which  were subsequently christened \"Czar,\" \"Satan,\" and \"Misery\" respectively;  the first from his noble and king-like mien, the second from his wild and  exceedingly unpleasant habit of kicking and striking--habits due not to  vice but to the nervousness of youth--and the third from his plaintive  remonstrances and sad-eyed looks of reproach as his saddle and load were  placed on his back.    The price of a good pack-camel then varied from 60 pounds to 80  pounds--and such prices as 100 pounds to 130 pounds were given for  first-class riding-camels. For South Australian-bred camels, the  descendants of stock originally imported from India by Sir Thomas Elder  some thirty years ago, a higher price was asked than for those brought  into the Colony direct from Kurrachi; and rightly, for there can be no  doubt but that in size, strength, and endurance, the camel of Australian  birth is far ahead of his old-world cousin. Not only are Indian camels  smaller and less fitted for the heavy work of the interior, but their  liability, until acclimatised, to mange and other diseases makes them most  undesirable acquisitions.    The near approach of midsummer, and the known scarcity of water, had  induced me to include in my equipment a portable condenser, by means of  which we should convert the brine of the salt lakes into water fit to  drink.

And how glad the girl was now that she had thus treasured  these things.    But the loss of the trunk, with all her clothing --common though that  clothing had been--was a disaster that Ruth could not easily get  over. She cried herself to sleep that night and in the morning came  down with a woebegone face indeed. Uncle Jabez did not notice her, and  even Aunt Alvirah did not comment upon her swollen eyes and  tear-streaked countenance. But the old woman, if anything, was kinder  than ever to her.    It was Saturday, and butter day. Uncle Jabez owned one cow, and since  Ruth had come to the mill it was her work twice a week to churn the  butter. The churn was a stone crock with a wooden dasher and Ruth had  just emptied in the thick cream when Helen Cameron ran in.    \"Oh, Ruth!\" she cried. \"You're always busy--especially if I chance to  want you at all particularly.\"    \"If you will be a drone yourself, Helen, you must expect to be always  hunting company,\" laughed Ruth. \"Just what is troubling Miss Cameron  at present?\"    \"We're going to dress the Cove Chapel for to-morrow. You know, I told  you our guild attends to the decoration of the chapel and I've just  set my heart on making a great pillow of buttercups. The fields are  full of them. And Tom says he'll help. Now, you'll come; won't you?\"    \"If I come for buttercups it will have to be after the butter comes!\"  returned Ruth, laughing.    She had begun to beat the dasher up and down and little particles of  cream sprayed up through the hole in the cover of the jar, around the  handle of the dasher. Helen looked on with growing interest.    \"And is that the way to make butter?\" she asked. \"And the cream's  almost white. Our butter is yellow--golden. Just as golden as the  buttercups. Do you color it?\"    \"Not at this time of year. I used to help Miss True make butter. She  had a cow. She said I was a good butter maker. You see, it's all in  the washing after the butter comes. You wait and see.\"    \"But I want to pick buttercups--and Tom is waiting down by the  bridge.\"    \"Can't help it. Butter before buttercups,\" declared Ruth, keeping the  dasher steadily at work. \"And then, Aunt Alvirah may want me for  something else before dinner.\"    \"We've got dinner with us--or, Tom has. At least, Babette put us up a  basket of lunch.\"    \"Oh! A picnic!\" cried Ruth, flushing with pleasure. This visit had  driven out of her mind --for the time, at least--her trouble of  overnight.    \"I'm going to ask Aunt Alviry for you,\" went on Helen, and skipped  away to find the little old woman who, despite the drawback of \"her  back and her bones\" was a very neat and particular housekeeper. She  was back in a few moments.    \"She says you can go, just as soon as you get the butter made. Now,  hurry up, and let us get into the buttercup field, which is a whole  lot nicer than the butter churn and--Oh! it smells much nicer, too.  Why, Ruth, that cream actually smells sour!\"    \"I expect it is sour,\" laughed her friend. \"Didn't you know that sweet  butter comes from sour cream? And that most nice things are the result  of hard work? The sweet from the bitter, you know.\"    \"My! how philosophical we are this morning. Isn't that butter ever  coming?\"    \"Impatience! Didn't you ever have to wait for anything you wanted in  your life?\"    \"Why, I've got to wait till next fall before I go to Briarwood Hall.  That's a rhyme, Ruthie; it's been singing itself over and over in my  mind for days. I'm really going to boarding school in the autumn. It's  decided. Tom is going to the military academy on the other side of  Osago Lake. He'll be within ten miles of Briarwood.\"    Ruth's face had lost its brightness as Helen said this. The word  \"school\" had brought again to the girl's mind her own unfortunate  position and Uncle Jabez's unkindness.    \"I hope you will have a delightful time at Briarwood,\" Ruth said,  softly. \"I expect I shall miss you dreadfully.\"    \"Oh, suppose the Ogre should send you to school there, too!\" cried  Helen, with clasped hands. \"Wouldn't that be splendid!\"    \"That would be beyond all imagination,\" said Ruth, shaking her head.  \"I--I don't know that I shall be able to attend the balance of the  term here.\"    \"Why not?\" demanded Helen. \"Won't he let you?\"    \"He has said I could.\" Ruth could say no more just then. She hid her  face from her friend, but made believe that it was the butter that  occupied her attention. The dasher began to slap, slap, slap  suggestively in the churn and little particles of beaten cream began  to gather on the handle of the dasher.    \"Oh!\" cried Helen. \"It's getting hard!\"    \"The butter is coming. Now a little cold water to help it separate.  And then you shall have a most delicious glass of buttermilk.\"    \"No, thank you!\" cried Helen. \"They say it's good for one to drink it.  But I never do like anything that's good for me.\"    \"Give it to me, Ruth,\" interposed another voice, and Tom put a smiling  face around the corner of the well. \"I thought you were never coming,  Miss Flyaway,\" he said, to his sister.    \"Butter before buttercups, young man,\" responded Helen, primly. \"We  must wait for Ruth to--er--wash the butter, is it?\"    \"Yes,\" said her friend, seriously, opening the churn and beginning to  ladle out the now yellow butter into a wooden bowl.    \"May I assist at the butter's toilet?\" queried Tom, grinning.    \"You may sit down and watch,\" said his sister, in a tone intended to  quell any undue levity on her brother's part.    Ruth had rolled her sleeves above her elbows, so displaying her pretty  plump arms, and now worked and worked the butter in cold water right  \"from the north side of the well\" as though she were kneading bread.  First she had poured Tom a pitcher of the fresh buttermilk, and given  him a glass. Even Helen tasted a little of the tart drink.    \"Oh, it's ever so nice, I suppose,\" she said, with a little grimace;  \"but I much prefer my milk sweet.\"    Again and again Ruth poured off the milky water and ran fresh, cold  water upon her butter until no amount of kneading and washing would  subtract another particle of milk from the yellow ball. The water was  perfectly clear.    \"Now I'll salt it,\" she said; \"and put it away until this afternoon,  and then I'll work it again and put it down in the butter-jar. When I  grow up and get rich I am going to have a great, big dairy; with a  herd of registered cattle, and I'm going to make all the butter  myself.\"    \"And Tom's going to raise horses. He's going to own a stock farm--so  he says. You'd better combine interests,\" said Helen, with some scorn.  \"I like horses to ride, and butter to eat, but--well, I prefer  buttercups just now. Hurry up, Miss Slow-poke! We'll never get enough  flowers for a pillow.\"    So Ruth cleaned her face, taking a peep into the glass in the kitchen  to make sure, before going out to her friends. Tom looked at her with  plain approval, and Helen jumped up to squeeze her again.    \"No wonder Aunt Alvirah calls you 'pretty creetur',\" she whispered in  Ruth's ear. \"For that's what you are.\" Then to Tom: \"Now young man,  have you the lunch basket?\"    \"What there is left of it is in charge of Reno down at the bridge,\" he  replied, coolly.    They found the huge mastiff lying with the napkin-covered basket  between his forepaws, on the grass by the water side. Reno was  growling warningly and had his eyes fixed upon a figure leaning upon  the bridge railing.    \"That there dawg don't seem ter take to me,\" drawled Jasper Parloe,  who was the person on the bridge. \"He needn't be afraid. I wouldn't  touch the basket.\"    \"You won't be likely to touch it while Reno has charge of it,\" said  Tom, quietly, while the girls passed on swiftly. Neither Ruth nor  Helen liked to have anything to do with Parloe. When Tom released Reno  from his watch and ward, the dog trotted after Ruth and put his nose  into her hand.    \"Ye been up ter the mill, hev ye?\" queried Parloe, eyeing Tom Cameron  aslant, \"ye oughter be gre't friends with Jabe Potter. Or has he  squared hisself with ye?\"    \"Say, Mister Parloe,\" said Tom, sharply, \"you've been hinting  something about the miller every time you've seen me lately.    \"Only since yeou was knocked down that bank inter the gully, an' yer  arm an' head hurt. There warn't nothin' about Jabe ter interest yeou  afore that,\" returned Parloe, quickly.    Tom flushed suddenly and he looked at the old fellow with new  interest.    \"Just what do you mean?\" he asked, slowly.    \"Ye know well enough. Your dad, Tom Cameron, is mighty riled up over  your bein' hurt. I heered him say that he'd give a ten-dollar note ter  know who it was drove by ye that night and crowded ye inter the ditch.  Would you give more than that not ter have it known who done it?\"    \"What do you mean?\" exclaimed Tom, angrily.    \"I guess ye like this here gal that's cone to live on Jabez, purty  well; don't ye--yeou an' yer sister?\" croaked old Parloe. \"Wal, if  your dad an' the miller gits inter a row--comes ter a clinch, as ye  might say--yeou an' yer sister won't be let ter hev much ter do with  Ruth, eh, now?\"    \"I don't know that that's so,\" Tom said doggedly.    \"Oh, yes, ye do. Think it over. Old Jabe will put his foot right down  an' he'll stop Ruth havin' anything ter do with ye--ye know it! Wal,  now; think it over. I got a conscience, I have,\" pursued Parloe,  cringing and rubbing his hands together, his sly little eyes  sparkling. \"I r'ally feel as though I'd oughter tell yer dad who it  was almost run ye down that night and made ye fall into the gully.\"    \"You mean, you'd like to handle Dad's ten dollars!\" cried Tom,  angrily.    Parloe smirked and still rubbed his hands together. \"Don't matter a  mite whose ten dollars I handle,\" he said, suggestively. \"Your ten  dollars would be jest as welcome to me as your Dad's, Master Cameron.\"    \"Ten dollars is a lot of money,\" said Tom.    \"Yes.
