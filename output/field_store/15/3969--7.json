Next morning we crossed the Salt River at a lower place where was  a fine, hard bottom. That afternoon we travelled for 6 miles through  a beautiful and level country, covered with a forest of large poplars,  not very thick; it will some day be an ideal cattle-range, for it  had rank grass everywhere, and was varied by occasional belts of  jack-pine. In one of these Preble found a nest with six eggs that  proved to be those of the Bohemian Chatterer. These he secured,  with photograph of the nest and old bird. It was the best find of  the journey.    The eggs proved of different incubation--at least a week's  difference--showing that the cool nights necessitated immediate  setting.    We camped at Salt River mouth, and next afternoon were back at Fort  Smith, having been out five days and seen nothing, though there  were tracks of Moose and Bear in abundance.    Here our guide said good-bye to us, and so did the Indian dog.          CHAPTER XII    BEZKYA AND THE PILLS        During this journey I had successfully treated two of the men for  slight ailments, and Squirrel had made mental note of the fact.  A result of it was that in the morning an old, old, black-looking  Indian came hobbling on a stick to my tent and, in husky Chipewyan,  roughly translated by Billy, told me that he had pains in his head  and his shoulder and his body, and his arms and his legs and his  feet, and he couldn't hunt, couldn't fish, couldn't walk, couldn't  eat, couldn't lie, couldn't sleep, and he wanted me to tackle  the case. I hadn't the least idea of what ailed the old chap, but  conveyed no hint of my darkness. I put on my very medical look  and said: \"Exactly so. Now you take these pills and you will find  a wonderful difference in the morning.\" I had some rather fierce  rhubarb pills; one was a dose but, recognising the necessity for  eclat, I gave him two.    He gladly gulped them down in water. The Indian takes kindly to  pills, it's so easy to swallow them, so obviously productive of  results, and otherwise satisfactory. Then, the old man hobbled off  to his lodge.    A few hours later he was back again, looking older and shakier  than ever, his wet red eyes looking like plague spots in his ashy  brown visage or like volcanic eruptions in a desert of dead lava,  and in husky, clicking accents he told Billy to tell the Okimow  that the pills were no good--not strong enough for him.    \"Well,\" I said, \"he shall surely have results this time.\" I gave  him three big ones in a cup of hot tea. All the Indians love tea,  and it seems to help them. Under its cheering power the old man's  tongue was loosened. He talked more clearly, and Billy, whose  knowledge of Chipewyan is fragmentary at best, suddenly said: \"I'm  afraid I made, a mistake. Bezkya says the pills are too strong.  Can't you give him something to stop them?    \"Goodness,\" I thought; \"here's a predicament,\" but I didn't know  what to do. I remembered a western adage, \"When you don't know a  thing to do, don't do a thing.\" I only said: \"Tell Bezkya to go home,  go to bed, and stay there till to-morrow, then come here again.\"    Away went the Indian to his lodge. I felt rather uneasy that day  and night, and the next morning looked with some eagerness for the  return of Bezkya. But he did not come and I began to grow unhappy.  I wanted some evidence that I had not done him an injury. I wished  to see him, but professional etiquette forbade me betraying myself  by calling on him. Noon came and no Bezkya; late afternoon, and  then I sallied forth, not to seek him, but to pass near his lodge,  as though I were going to the Hudson's Bay store. And there, to my  horror, about the lodge I saw a group of squaws, with shawls over  their heads, whispering, together. As I went by, all turned as one  of them pointed at me, and again they whispered.    \"Oh, heavens!\" I thought; \"I've killed the old man.\" But still  I would not go in. That night I did not sleep for worrying about  it. Next morning I was on the point of sending Billy to learn the  state of affairs, when who should come staggering up but old Bezkya.  He was on two crutches now, his complexion was a dirty gray, and  his feeble knees were shaking, but he told Billy--yes, unmistakably  this time--to tell the Okimow that that was great medicine I had  given him, and he wanted a dose just like it for his wife.          CHAPTER XIII    FORT SMITH AND THE SOCIAL QUEEN        Several times during our river journey I heard reference to  an extraordinary woman in the lower country, one who gave herself  great airs, put on style, who was so stuck up, indeed, that she had  \"two pots, one for tea, one for coffee.\" Such incredible pomposity  and arrogance naturally invited sarcastic comment from all the  world, and I was told I should doubtless see this remarkable person  at Fort Smith.    After the return from Buffalo hunt No. 2, and pending arrangements  for hunt No. 3, 1 saw more of Fort Smith than I wished for, but  endeavoured to turn the time to account by copying out interesting  chapters from the rough semi-illegible, perishable manuscript  accounts of northern life called \"old-timers.\" The results of this  library research work appear under the chapter heads to which they  belong.    At each of these northern posts there were interesting experiences  in store for me, as one who had read all the books of northern travel  and dreamed for half a lifetime of the north; and that was--almost  daily meeting with famous men. I suppose it would be similar if  one of these men were to go to London or Washington and have some  one tell him: that gentle old man there is Lord Roberts, or that  meek, shy, retiring person is Speaker Cannon; this on the first  bench is Lloyd-George, or that with the piercing eyes is Aldrich,  the uncrowned King of America. So it was a frequent and delightful  experience to meet with men whose names have figured in books of  travel for a generation. This was Roderick MacFarlane, who founded  Fort Anderson, discovered the MacFarlane Rabbit, etc.; here was  John Schott, who guided Caspar Whitney; that was Hanbury's head  man; here was Murdo McKay, who travelled with Warburton Pike in  the Barrens and starved with him on Peace River; and so with many  more.    Very few of these men had any idea of the interest attaching  to their observations. Their notion of values centres chiefly on  things remote from their daily life. It was very surprising to see  how completely one may be outside of the country he lives in. Thus  I once met a man who had lived sixteen years in northern Ontario,  had had his chickens stolen every year by Foxes, and never in his  life had seen a Fox. I know many men who live in Wolf country, and  hear them at least every week, but have never seen one in twenty  years' experience. Quite recently I saw a score of folk who had  lived in the porcupiniest part of the Adirondacks for many summers  and yet never saw a Porcupine, and did not know what it was when  I brought one into their camp. So it was not surprising to me to  find that although living in a country that swarmed with Moose, in  a village which consumes at least a hundred Moose per annum, there  were at Fort Smith several of the Hudson's Bay men that had lived  on Moose meat all their lives and yet had never seen a live Moose.  It sounds like a New Yorker saying he had never seen a stray cat.  But I was simply dumfounded by a final development in the same line.    Quite the most abundant carpet in the forest here is the uva-ursi  or bear-berry. Its beautiful evergreen leaves and bright red berries  cover a quarter of the ground in dry woods and are found in great  acre beds. It furnishes a staple of food to all wild things, birds  and beasts, including Foxes, Martens, and Coyotes; it is one of the  most abundant of the forest products, and not one hundred yards from  the fort are solid patches as big as farms, and yet when I brought  in a spray to sketch it one day several of the Hudson's Bay officers  said: \"Where in the world did you get that? It must be very rare,  for I never yet saw it in this country.\" A similar remark was made  about a phoebe-bird. \"It was never before seen in the country\"; and  yet there is a pair nesting every quarter of a mile from Athabaska  Landing to Great Slave Lake.    Fort Smith, being the place of my longest stay, was the scene of  my largest medical practice.    One of my distinguished patients here was Jacob McKay, a half-breed  born on Red River in 1840. He left there in 1859 to live 3 years  at Rat Portage. Then he went to Norway House, and after 3 years  moved to Athabaska in 1865. In 1887 he headed a special government  expedition into the Barren Grounds to get some baby Musk-ox skins.  He left Fort Rae, April 25, 1887, and, travelling due north with  Dogrib Indians some 65 miles, found Musk-ox on May 10, and later  saw many hundreds. They killed 16 calves for their pelts, but no  old ones. McKay had to use all his influence to keep the Indians  from slaughtering wholesale; indeed, it was to restrain them that  he was sent.    He now lives at Fort Resolution.    One morning the chief came and said he wanted me to doctor a sick  woman in his lodge. I thought sick women a good place for an amateur  to draw the line, but Squirrel did not. \"Il faut venir; elle est  bien malade.\"    At length I took my pill-kit and followed him. Around his lodge  were a score of the huge sled dogs, valuable animals in winter,  but useless, sullen, starving, noisy nuisances all summer. If you  kick them out of your way, they respect you; if you pity them, they  bite you. They respected us.    We entered the lodge, and there sitting by the fire were two squaws  making moccasins. One was old and ugly as sin; the second, young  and pretty as a brown fawn. I looked from one to the other in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6840"],[0,"Queen Lucia (#11)"],[1," to understand that she was reading it for the first time.  He had already got a copy, and had practised his part last night, but  then he was in the superior position of not having a husband who would  inadvertently tell on him! Meantime it was of the first importance to  get that particular shade of purple silk that had none of that  \"tarsome\" magenta-tint in it. Meantime also, it was of even greater  importance to observe the movements of Riseholme.    Just opposite was the village green, and as nobody was quite close to  him Georgie put on his spectacles, which he could whisk off in a  moment. It was these which formed that bulge in his pocket which  Peppino had noticed, but the fact of his using spectacles at all was a  secret that would have to be profoundly kept for several years yet. But  as there was no one at all near him, he stealthily adjusted them on his  small straight nose. The morning train from town had evidently come in,  for there was a bustle of cabs about the door of the Ambermere Arms,  and a thing that thrilled him to the marrow was the fact that Lady  Ambermere's motor was undoubtedly among them. That must surely mean  that Lady Ambermere herself was here, for when poor thin Miss Lyall,  her companion, came in to Riseholme to do shopping, or transact such  business as the majestic life at The Hall required, she always came on  foot, or in very inclement weather in a small two-wheeled cart like a  hip-bath. At this moment, steeped in conjecture, who should appear,  walking stiffly, with her nose in the air, as if suspecting, and not  choosing to verify, some faint unpleasant odour, but Lady Ambermere  herself, coming from the direction of The Hurst.... Clearly she must  have got there after Peppino had left, or he would surely have  mentioned the fact that Lady Ambermere had been at The Hurst, if she  _had_ been at The Hurst. It is true that she was only coming from  the direction of The Hurst, but Georgie put into practice, in his  mental processes Darwin's principle, that in order to observe usefully,  you must have a theory. Georgie's theory was that Lady Ambermere had  been at The Hurst just for a minute or two, and hastily put his  spectacles in his pocket. With the precision of a trained mind he also  formed the theory that some business had brought Lady Ambermere into  Riseholme, and that taking advantage of her presence there, she had  probably returned a verbal answer to Lucia's invitation to her  garden-party, which she would have received by the first post this  morning. He was quite ready to put his theory to the test when Lady  Ambermere had arrived at the suitable distance for his conveniently  observing her, and for taking off his hat. She always treated him like  a boy, which he liked. The usual salutation passed.    \"I don't know where my people are,\" said Lady Ambermere majestically.  \"Have you seen my motor?\"    \"Yes, dear lady, it's in at your own arms,\" said Georgie brightly.  \"Happy motor!\"    If Lady Ambermere unbent to anybody, she unbent to Georgie. He was of  quite good family, because his mother had been a Bartlett and a second  cousin of her deceased husband. Sometimes when she talked to Georgie  she said \"we,\" implying thereby his connection with the aristocracy,  and this gratified Georgie nearly as much as did her treatment of him  as being quite a boy still. It was to him, as a boy still, that she  answered.    \"Well, the happy motor, you little rascal, must come to my arms instead  of being at them,\" she said with the quick wit for which Riseholme  pronounced her famous. \"Fancy being able to see my motor at that  distance. Young eyes!\"    It was really young spectacles, but Georgie did not mind that. In fact,  he would not have corrected the mistake for the world.    \"Shall I run across and fetch it for you?\" he asked.    \"In a minute. Or whistle on your fingers like a vulgar street boy,\"  said Lady Ambermere. \"I'm sure you know how to.\"    Georgie had not the slightest idea, but with the courage of youth,  presuming, with the prudence of middle-age, that he would not really be  called upon to perform so unimaginable a feat, he put two fingers up to  his mouth.    \"Here goes then!\" he said, greatly daring. (He knew perfectly well that  the dignity of Lady Ambermere would not permit rude vulgar whistling,  of which he was hopelessly incapable, to summon her motor. She made a  feint of stopping her ears with her hands.)    \"Don't do anything of the kind,\" she said. \"In a minute you shall walk  with me across to the Arms, but tell me this first. I have just been to  say to our good Mrs Lucas that very likely I will look in at her  garden-party on Friday, if I have nothing else to do. But who is this  wonderful creature she is expecting? Is it an Indian conjurer? If so, I  should like to see him, because when Ambermere was in Madras I remember  one coming to the Residency who had cobras and that sort of thing. I  told her I didn't like snakes, and she said there shouldn't be any. In  fact, it was all rather mysterious, and she didn't at present know if  he was coming or not. I only said, 'No snakes: I insist on no snakes.'\"    Georgie relieved her mind about the chance of there being snakes, and  gave a short _precis_ of the ascertained habits of the Guru,  laying special stress on his high-caste.    \"Yes, some of these Brahmins are of very decent family,\" admitted Lady  Ambermere. \"I was always against lumping all dark-skinned people  together and calling them niggers. When we were at Madras I was famed  for my discrimination.\"    They were walking across the green as Lady Ambermere gave vent to these  liberal sentiments, and Georgie even without the need of his spectacles  could see Peppino, who had spied Lady Ambermere from the door of the  market-gardener's, hurrying down the street, in order to get a word  with her before \"her people\" drove her back to The Hall.    \"I came into Riseholme today to get rooms at the Arms for Olga  Bracely,\" she observed.    \"The prima-donna?\" asked Georgie breathless with excitement.    \"Yes; she is coming to stay at the Arms for two nights with Mr  Shuttleworth.\"    \"Surely--\" began Georgie.    \"No, it is all right, he is her husband, they were married last week,\"  said Lady Ambermere. \"I should have thought that Shuttleworth was a  good enough name, as the Shuttleworths are cousins of the late lord,  but she prefers to call herself Miss Bracely. I don't dispute her right  to call herself what she pleases: far from it, though who the Bracelys  were, I have never been able to discover. But when George Shuttleworth  wrote to me saying that he and his wife were intending to stay here for  a couple of days, and proposing to come over to The Hall to see me, I  thought I would just look in at the Arms myself, and see that they were  promised proper accommodation. They will dine with me tomorrow. I have  a few people staying, and no doubt Miss Bracely will sing afterwards.  My Broadwood was always considered a remarkably fine instrument. It was  very proper of George Shuttleworth to say that he would be in the  neighbourhood, and I daresay she is a very decent sort of woman.\"    They had come to the motor by this time--the rich, the noble motor, as  Mr Pepys would have described it--and there was poor Miss Lyall hung  with parcels, and wearing a faint sycophantic smile. This miserable  spinster, of age so obvious as to be called not the least uncertain,  was Lady Ambermere's companion, and shared with her the glories of The  Hall, which had been left to Lady Ambermere for life. She was provided  with food and lodging and the use of the cart like a hip-bath when Lady  Ambermere had errands for her to do in Riseholme, so what could a woman  want more? In return for these bounties, her only duty was to devote  herself body and mind to her patroness, to read the paper aloud, to set  Lady Ambermere's patterns for needlework, to carry the little Chinese  dog under her arm, and wash him once a week, to accompany Lady  Ambermere to church, and never to have a fire in her bedroom. She had a  melancholy wistful little face: her head was inclined with a backward  slope on her neck, and her mouth was invariably a little open shewing  long front teeth, so that she looked rather like a roast hare sent up  to table with its head on. Georgie always had a joke ready for Miss  Lyall, of the sort that made her say, \"Oh, Mr Pillson!\" and caused her  to blush. She thought him remarkably pleasant.    Georgie had his joke ready on this occasion.    \"Why, here's Miss Lyall!\" he said. \"And what has Miss Lyall been doing  while her ladyship and I have been talking? Better not ask, perhaps.\"    \"Oh, Mr Pillson!\" said Miss Lyall, as punctually as a cuckoo clock when  the hands point to the hour.    Lady Ambermere put half her weight onto the step of the motor, causing  it to creak and sway.    \"Call on the Shuttleworths, Georgie,\" she said. \"Say I told you to.  Home!\"    Miss Lyall effaced herself on the front seat of the motor, like a mouse  hiding in a corner, after Lady Ambermere had got in, and the footman  mounted onto the box. At that moment Peppino with his bag of bulbs, a  little out of breath, squeezed his way between two cabs by the side of  the motor. He was just too late, and the motor moved off. It was very  improbable that Lady Ambermere saw him at all.    Georgie felt very much like a dog with a bone in his mouth, who only  wants to get away from all the other dogs and discuss it quietly. It is  safe to say that never in twenty-four hours had so many exciting things  happened to him. He had ordered a toupet, he had been looked on with  favour by a Guru, all Riseholme knew that he had had quite a long  conversation with Lady Ambermere and nobody in Riseholme, except  himself, knew that Olga Bracely was going to spend two nights here.  Well he remembered her marvellous appearance last year at Covent Garden  in the part of Brunnhilde. He had"]]]
