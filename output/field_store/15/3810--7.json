POTHOLES. In rapids streams also drill out their rocky beds. Where  some slight depression gives rise to an eddy, the pebbles which  gather in it are whirled round and round, and, acting like the bit  of an auger, bore out a cylindrical pit called a pothole. Potholes  sometimes reach a depth of a score of feet. Where they are  numerous they aid materially in deepening the channel, as the  walls between them are worn away and they coalesce.    WATERFALLS. One of the most effective means of erosion which the  river possesses is the waterfall. The plunging water dislodges  stones from the face of the ledge over which it pours, and often  undermines it by excavating a deep pit at its base. Slice after  slice is thus thrown down from the front of the cliff, and the  cataract cuts its way upstream leaving a gorge behind it.    NIAGARA FALLS. The Niagara River flows from Lake Erie at Buffalo in  a broad channel which it has cut but a few feet below the level of  the region. Some thirteen miles from the outlet it plunges over a  ledge one hundred and seventy feet high into the head of a narrow  gorge which extends for seven miles to the escarpment of the  upland in which the gorge is cut. The strata which compose the  upland dip gently upstream and consist at top of a massive  limestone, at the Falls about eighty feet thick, and below of soft  and easily weathered shale. Beneath the Falls the underlying shale  is cut and washed away by the descending water and retreats also  because of weathering, while the overhanging limestone breaks down  in huge blocks from time to time.    Niagara is divided by Goat Island into the Horseshoe Falls and the  American Falls. The former is supplied by the main current of the  river, and from the semicircular sweep of its rim a sheet of water  in places at least fifteen or twenty feet deep plunges into a pool  a little less than two hundred feet in depth. Here the force of  the falling water is sufficient to move about the fallen blocks of  limestone and use them in the excavation of the shale of the bed.  At the American Falls the lesser branch of the river, which flows  along the American side of Goat Island, pours over the side of the  gorge and breaks upon a high talus of limestone blocks which its  smaller volume of water is unable to grind to pieces and remove.    A series of surveys have determined that from 1842 to 1890 the  Horseshoe Falls retreated at the rate of 2.18 feet per year, while  the American Falls retreated at the rate of 0.64 feet in the same  period. We cannot doubt that the same agency which is now  lengthening the gorge at this rapid rate has cut it back its  entire length of seven miles.    While Niagara Falls have been cutting back a gorge seven miles  long and from two hundred to three hundred feet deep, the river  above the Falls has eroded its bed scarcely below the level of the  upland on which it flows. Like all streams which are the outlets  of lakes, the Niagara flows out of Lake Erie clear of sediment, as  from a settling basin, and carries no tools with which to abrade  its bed. We may infer from this instance how slight is the erosive  power of clear water on hard rock.    Assuming that the rate of recession of the combined volumes of the  American and Horseshoe Falls was three feet a year below Goat  Island, and ASSUMING THAT THIS RATE HAS BEEN UNIFORM IN THE PAST,  how long is it since the Niagara River fell over the edge of the  escarpment where now is the mouth of the present gorge?    The profile of the bed of the Niagara along the gorge (Fig. 39)  shows alternating deeps and shallows which cannot be accounted  for, except in a single instance, by the relative hardness of the  rocks of the river bed. The deeps do not exceed that at the foot  of the Horseshoe Falls at the present time. When the gorge was  being cut along the shallows, how did the Falls compare in  excavating power, in force, and volume with the Niagara of to-day?  How did the rate of recession at those times compare with the  present rate? Is the assumption made above that the rate of  recession has been uniform correct?    The first stretch of shallows below the Falls causes a tumultuous  rapid impossible to sound. Its depth has been estimated at thirty-  five feet. From what data could such an estimate be made?    Suggest a reason why the Horseshoe Falls are convex upstream.    At the present rate of recession which will reach the head of Goat  Island the sooner, the American or the Horseshoe Falls? What will  be the fate of the Falls left behind when the other has passed  beyond the head of the island?    The rate at which a stream erodes its bed depends in part upon the  nature of the rocks over which it flows. Will a stream deepen its  channel more rapidly on massive or on thin-bedded and close-  jointed rocks? on horizontal strata or on strata steeply inclined?    DEPOSITION    While the river carries its invisible load of dissolved rock on  without stop to the sea, its load of visible waste is subject to  many delays en route. Now and again it is laid aside, to be picked  up later and carried some distance farther on its way. One of the  most striking features of the river therefore is the waste  accumulated along its course, in bars and islands in the channel,  beneath its bed, and in flood plains along its banks. All this  alluvium, to use a general term for river deposits, with which the  valley is cumbered is really en route to the sea; it is only  temporarily laid aside to resume its journey later on. Constantly  the river is destroying and rebuilding its alluvial deposits, here  cutting and there depositing along its banks, here eroding and  there building a bar, here excavating its bed and there filling it  up, and at all times carrying the material picked up at one point  some distance on downstream before depositing it at another.    These deposits are laid down by slackening currents where the  velocity of the stream is checked, as on the inner side of curves,  and where the slope of the bed is diminished, and in the lee of  islands, bridge piers and projecting points of land. How slight is  the check required to cause a current to drop a large part of its  load may be inferred from the law of the relation of the  transporting power to the velocity. If the velocity is decreased  one half, the current can move fragments but one sixty-fourth the  size of those which it could move before, and must drop all those  of larger size.    Will a river deposit more at low water or at flood? when rising or  when falling?    STRATIFICATION. River deposits are stratified, as may be seen in  any fresh cut in banks or bars. The waste of which they are built  has been sorted and deposited in layers, one above another; some  of finer and some of coarser material. The sorting action of  running water depends on the fact that its transporting power  varies with the velocity. A current whose diminishing velocity  compels it to drop coarse gravel, for example, is still able to  move all the finer waste of its load, and separating it from the  gravel, carries it on downstream; while at a later time slower  currents may deposit on the gravel bed layers of sand, and, still  later, slack water may leave on these a layer of mud. In case of  materials lighter than water the transporting power does not  depend on the velocity, and logs of wood, for instance, are  floated on to the sea on the slowest as well as on the most rapid  currents.    CROSS BEDDING. A section of a bar exposed at low water may show  that it is formed of layers of sand, or coarser stuff, inclined  downstream as steeply often as the angle of repose of the  material. From a boat anchored over the lower end of a submerged  sand bar we may observe the way in which this structure, called  cross bedding, is produced. Sand is continually pushed over the  edge of the bar at b (Fig. 42) and comes to rest in successive  layers on the sloping surface. At the same time the bar may be  worn away at the upper end, a, and thus slowly advance down  stream. While the deposit is thus cross bedded, it constitutes as  a whole a stratum whose upper and lower surfaces are about  horizontal. In sections of river banks one may often see a  vertical succession of cross-bedded strata, each built in the way  described.    WATER WEAR. The coarser material of river deposits, such as  cobblestones, gravel, and the larger grains of sand, are WATER  WORN, or rounded, except when near their source. Rolling along the  bottom they have been worn round by impact and friction as they  rubbed against one another and the rocky bed of the stream.    Experiments have shown that angular fragments of granite lose  nearly half their weight and become well rounded after traveling  fifteen miles in rotating cylinders partly filled with water.  Marbles are cheaply made in Germany out of small limestone cubes  set revolving in a current of water between a rotating bed of  stone and a block of oak, the process requiring but about fifteen  minutes. It has been found that in the upper reaches of mountain  streams a descent of less than a mile is sufficient to round  pebbles of granite.    LAND FORMS DUE TO RIVER EROSION    RIVER VALLEYS. In their courses to the sea, rivers follow valleys  of various forms, some shallow and some deep, some narrow and some  wide. Since rivers are known to erode their beds and banks, it is  a fair presumption that, aided by the weather, they have excavated  the valleys in which they flow.    Moreover, a bird's-eye view or a map of a region shows the  significant fact that the valleys of a system unite with one  another in a branch work, as twigs meet their stems and the  branches of a tree its trunk. Each valley, from that of the  smallest rivulet to that of the master stream, is proportionate to  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#11)"],[1,"and a part of the ship's  stores; there was a second store-room underneath, which you entered by a  hatchway in the middle of the deck; indeed, all the best of the meat and  drink and the whole of the powder were collected in this place; and all  the firearms, except the two pieces of brass ordnance, were set in a  rack in the aftermost wall of the round-house. The most of the cutlasses  were in another place.    A small window with a shutter on each side, and a skylight in the roof,  gave it light by day; and after dark there was a lamp always burning.  It was burning when I entered, not brightly, but enough to show Mr.  Shuan sitting at the table, with the brandy bottle and a tin pannikin  in front of him. He was a tall man, strongly made and very black; and he  stared before him on the table like one stupid.    He took no notice of my coming in; nor did he move when the captain  followed and leant on the berth beside me, looking darkly at the mate.  I stood in great fear of Hoseason, and had my reasons for it; but  something told me I need not be afraid of him just then; and I whispered  in his ear: \"How is he?\" He shook his head like one that does not know  and does not wish to think, and his face was very stern.    Presently Mr. Riach came in. He gave the captain a glance that meant the  boy was dead as plain as speaking, and took his place like the rest  of us; so that we all three stood without a word, staring down at Mr.  Shuan, and Mr. Shuan (on his side) sat without a word, looking hard upon  the table.    All of a sudden he put out his hand to take the bottle; and at that Mr.  Riach started forward and caught it away from him, rather by surprise  than violence, crying out, with an oath, that there had been too much of  this work altogether, and that a judgment would fall upon the ship.  And as he spoke (the weather sliding-doors standing open) he tossed the  bottle into the sea.    Mr. Shuan was on his feet in a trice; he still looked dazed, but he  meant murder, ay, and would have done it, for the second time that  night, had not the captain stepped in between him and his victim.    \"Sit down!\" roars the captain. \"Ye sot and swine, do ye know what ye've  done? Ye've murdered the boy!\"    Mr. Shuan seemed to understand; for he sat down again, and put up his  hand to his brow.    \"Well,\" he said, \"he brought me a dirty pannikin!\"    At that word, the captain and I and Mr. Riach all looked at each other  for a second with a kind of frightened look; and then Hoseason walked  up to his chief officer, took him by the shoulder, led him across to his  bunk, and bade him lie down and go to sleep, as you might speak to a bad  child. The murderer cried a little, but he took off his sea-boots and  obeyed.    \"Ah!\" cried Mr. Riach, with a dreadful voice, \"ye should have interfered  long syne. It's too late now.\"    \"Mr. Riach,\" said the captain, \"this night's work must never be kennt  in Dysart. The boy went overboard, sir; that's what the story is; and I  would give five pounds out of my pocket it was true!\" He turned to the  table. \"What made ye throw the good bottle away?\" he added. \"There was  nae sense in that, sir. Here, David, draw me another. They're in the  bottom locker;\" and he tossed me a key. \"Ye'll need a glass yourself,  sir,\" he added to Riach. \"Yon was an ugly thing to see.\"    So the pair sat down and hob-a-nobbed; and while they did so, the  murderer, who had been lying and whimpering in his berth, raised himself  upon his elbow and looked at them and at me.    That was the first night of my new duties; and in the course of the next  day I had got well into the run of them. I had to serve at the meals,  which the captain took at regular hours, sitting down with the officer  who was off duty; all the day through I would be running with a dram  to one or other of my three masters; and at night I slept on a blanket  thrown on the deck boards at the aftermost end of the round-house, and  right in the draught of the two doors. It was a hard and a cold bed;  nor was I suffered to sleep without interruption; for some one would be  always coming in from deck to get a dram, and when a fresh watch was  to be set, two and sometimes all three would sit down and brew a bowl  together. How they kept their health, I know not, any more than how I  kept my own.    And yet in other ways it was an easy service. There was no cloth to lay;  the meals were either of oatmeal porridge or salt junk, except twice a  week, when there was duff: and though I was clumsy enough and (not being  firm on my sealegs) sometimes fell with what I was bringing them, both  Mr. Riach and the captain were singularly patient. I could not but fancy  they were making up lee-way with their consciences, and that they  would scarce have been so good with me if they had not been worse with  Ransome.    As for Mr. Shuan, the drink or his crime, or the two together, had  certainly troubled his mind. I cannot say I ever saw him in his proper  wits. He never grew used to my being there, stared at me continually  (sometimes, I could have thought, with terror), and more than once drew  back from my hand when I was serving him. I was pretty sure from the  first that he had no clear mind of what he had done, and on my second  day in the round-house I had the proof of it. We were alone, and he had  been staring at me a long time, when all at once, up he got, as pale as  death, and came close up to me, to my great terror. But I had no cause  to be afraid of him.    \"You were not here before?\" he asked.    \"No, sir,\" said I.\"    \"There was another boy?\" he asked again; and when I had answered him,  \"Ah!\" says he, \"I thought that,\" and went and sat down, without another  word, except to call for brandy.    You may think it strange, but for all the horror I had, I was still  sorry for him. He was a married man, with a wife in Leith; but whether  or no he had a family, I have now forgotten; I hope not.    Altogether it was no very hard life for the time it lasted, which (as  you are to hear) was not long. I was as well fed as the best of them;  even their pickles, which were the great dainty, I was allowed my share  of; and had I liked I might have been drunk from morning to night, like  Mr. Shuan. I had company, too, and good company of its sort. Mr. Riach,  who had been to the college, spoke to me like a friend when he was not  sulking, and told me many curious things, and some that were informing;  and even the captain, though he kept me at the stick's end the most part  of the time, would sometimes unbuckle a bit, and tell me of the fine  countries he had visited.    The shadow of poor Ransome, to be sure, lay on all four of us, and on  me and Mr. Shuan in particular, most heavily. And then I had another  trouble of my own. Here I was, doing dirty work for three men that I  looked down upon, and one of whom, at least, should have hung upon a  gallows; that was for the present; and as for the future, I could only  see myself slaving alongside of negroes in the tobacco fields. Mr.  Riach, perhaps from caution, would never suffer me to say another word  about my story; the captain, whom I tried to approach, rebuffed me like  a dog and would not hear a word; and as the days came and went, my heart  sank lower and lower, till I was even glad of the work which kept me  from thinking.          CHAPTER IX      THE MAN WITH THE BELT OF GOLD    More than a week went by, in which the ill-luck that had hitherto  pursued the Covenant upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked.  Some days she made a little way; others, she was driven actually back.  At last we were beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to  and fro the whole of the ninth day, within sight of Cape Wrath and the  wild, rocky coast on either hand of it. There followed on that a council  of the officers, and some decision which I did not rightly understand,  seeing only the result: that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and  were running south.    The tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick, wet, white  fog that hid one end of the brig from the other. All afternoon, when  I went on deck, I saw men and officers listening hard over the  bulwarks--\"for breakers,\" they said; and though I did not so much as  understand the word, I felt danger in the air, and was excited.    Maybe about ten at night, I was serving Mr. Riach and the captain at  their supper, when the ship struck something with a great sound, and we  heard voices singing out. My two masters leaped to their feet.    \"She's struck!\" said Mr. Riach.    \"No, sir,\" said the captain. \"We've only run a boat down.\"    And they hurried out.    The captain was in the right of it. We had run down a boat in the fog,  and she had parted in the midst and gone to the bottom with all her crew  but one. This man (as I heard afterwards) had been sitting in the stern  as a passenger, while the rest were on the benches rowing. At the moment  of the blow, the stern had been thrown into the air, and the man (having  his hands free, and for all he was encumbered with a frieze overcoat  that came below his knees) had leaped up and caught hold of the brig's  bowsprit. It showed he had luck and much agility and unusual strength,  that he should have thus saved himself from such a pass. And yet, when  the captain brought him into the round-house, and I set eyes on him for  the first time, he looked as cool as I did.    He was smallish in stature, but well set and as nimble as a goat; his  face was of a good open expression, but sunburnt very dark, and heavily  freckled and pitted with the small-pox; his eyes were unusually light  and had a kind of dancing madness in them, that was both engaging and  alarming; and when he took off his great-coat, he laid a pair of fine  silver-mounted pistols on the table, and I saw that he was belted with  a great sword. His manners, besides, were elegant, and he pledged the  captain"]]]
