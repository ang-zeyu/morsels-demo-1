But we accomplished our work, with some sport and  considerable cost to our patience and muscular energy.    From the 10th to the 15th of August, companies A, B, and C moved out on  the Santa Fe road, and in two or three days were followed by companies  D and E. Our esteemed colonel, James Allen, having been taken ill,  ordered Captain Jefferson Hunt of company A to take command until the  colonel should recover and settle up the business of outfitting the  battalion.    Our route lay over rolling hills, through some timbered country and  some prairie. The weather was warm, and there was much suffering,  especially from lack of drinking water, this being scarce. The sick  felt the hardship particularly, and there was quite a number down with  chills and fever; such water as was obtainable was of poor quality,  warm and unhealthy, and added to the number of the sick.    Each company had a large wagon and three or four yoke of oxen to haul  the tents and camp equipage, and one issue of rations, I think it was  for one week. The government had assigned a doctor to our command,  George B. Sanderson of Platte County, Missouri. He proved to be so  cruel and tyrannical as to incur the ill-will of every man in the  command. He had immediate charge of the hospital wagons, and no matter  how ill a man was, he was not allowed to ride in the company's wagon  until he had reported to this cruel quack, who had to be honored with  the title of physician and surgeon. With his permission a man was  allowed to crawl into his company's wagon, which was filled nearly to  the bows with tents and other camp equipage. Sometimes there would be  five or six crowded in together, some shaking with ague and others  burning with fever. Our company wagon was called the Gray Eagle; John  Gilbert was the teamster, and did all in his power to favor those of  his comrades who deserved it.    Besides the company and hospital wagons, there were sutlers' or  merchants' wagons--speculators that are permitted to follow the army  for what they can make off the troops. They carry in stock such  things as they know from experience the soldier most needs, and many  luxuries; they had almost everything to entice the famishing soldier,  who had to stand guard over them and their stores. Many times, through  hardships, we seemed compelled to patronize them. Our suffering was  their opportunity, and they were not slow to take advantage of it.  Their prices were enormous, and their bills never failed to reach the  paymaster by each payday; after these were paid, the soldier came in  for the balance, if there was any. Some were very unfortunate through  sickness, and had to patronize the sutler, or merchant; others were  unwise in their purchases; and thus the eight dollars a month wages  often was spent before it was earned.    Our commissary and ammunition department included over a hundred  wagons; the three or four pieces of artillery followed close in our  rear, in charge of a wagonmaster and assistants.    The usual order of marching, as I remember it, was: an advance guard;  then the colonel and his staff; next came the body of the command; then  a rearguard, the baggage and hospital wagons, etc. Only on special  occasions was the main body of the battalion permitted to march at  will, as long as it remained between the front and rear guards. When  the country was specially rough, and roads had to be made, the road  hands, or, in military language, the sappers and miners, were allowed  extra rations, and had to start out very early with the advance guard.

WE crossed the Kaw River about the 17th of August, being ferried over  in flat boats by some half civilized Delaware and Shawnee Indians.  Where we crossed the river it was from three to four hundred yards  wide. The country in the neighborhood seemed to be well adapted to  farming. The Indians had good crops of corn and watermelons, and knew  as well as white men how to charge for them. These Indians were an  intelligent-looking people, having log cabins for dwellings.    From the Kaw we traveled to Spring Creek, over a beautiful country, and  there joined the companies that had preceded us. We met with rainstorms  that made it very disagreeable for us at night, when two of us would  spread one blanket and lie down on it. It would wet through at once;  and though we had tents over us, we often slept on the wet ground, in  wet clothes.    Moving onward to Stone Coal Creek, we there endured one of the severest  storms of wind and rain that any of us ever had experienced. Nearly  every tent was blown down; several government wagons were overturned,  and others were sent rolling before the wind as though they were  express or stage coaches; many men fell on their faces and held to  the shrubbery to avoid being carried away by the violence of the  hurricane, while others not so fortunate as to be able to catch hold  of a shrub were driven some rods before the blast. Some were bruised  and others badly frightened, but none received serious injury; and  although everybody was thoroughly soaked, not even the sick seemed to  be unfavorably affected in health by their experience.    The storm over and our clothing dried, we resumed our march. Coming to  a deep creek with precipitous banks, we had to hold the wagons back  with ropes and let them down gradually to the bed of the stream; then  a number of men with ropes, on the opposite side, assisted the teams  in drawing the wagons up the steep bank. We passed over some very fine  land to a place we named Allen's Grove, and camped. Next day we came  to the ruins of a city of the dim, distant past; the stone walls were  yet visible to the traveler. That night we rested on Beaver Creek. On  the 25th or 26th, while traveling through a beautiful country of rich  soil, one wagon with five or six people was upset into a creek, and  the occupants received a dangerous ducking, though I do not recall any  serious results following.    It was on this day that a messenger from Fort Leavenworth overtook us,  bringing the sorrowful news of the death of our esteemed commander,  Colonel James Allen. It was a sad blow to us, for all had learned to  respect, and, indeed, even to love him. Yet I have felt sometimes that  it was a kind providence to him that he was taken from us, for his  nature was too kind and sympathetic to have forced his men through what  the Mormon Battalion had to endure before reaching its destination.    Colonel Allen's death left a vacancy in the command that was not  difficult to fill according to military rules, as the next officer  in rank should have occupied his place. But plain as is the military  law on the subject, there arose a dispute, and much feeling was  worked up. The council of officers decided that, as Captain Jefferson  Hunt of company A had been placed in charge by Colonel Allen till the  latter should rejoin the command, he should continue in that position.  Accordingly, he led the battalion to Council Grove, where it was  learned that Lieutenant Colonel Smith was on the way, intending to  assume command. Thus the quiet of the camp was again disturbed, and  much feeling manifested. There were many warm discussions between the  officers and among the soldiers as well.    It was at Council Grove that Lieutenant Colonel Smith, Major Walker,  and G. B. Sanderson overtook us. The question of command was further  discussed, Captain Hunt standing up for his rights. But in the council,  Captain Nelson Higgins of Company D (my company) moved that Smith  should be recognized as the commanding officer; this was seconded by  Captain Davis of Company E; all the officers but three, viz.: Laron  Clark, Samuel Gully, and Wesley W. Willis, voted for the motion, and  the question was settled. Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Smith took command,  to the disgust of the soldiers, a large majority of whom, if not all,  were quite dissatisfied. Next day we reached Diamond Springs, where the  battalion was inspected by Lieutenant Colonel Smith.    At this time there was much sickness in camp, chills and fever and  mumps. This condition was produced by frequent changes of drinking  water, and by poorly-cooked food, as many times we had to depend on  dry weeds for fuel. When a man became sick, it had been the custom for  him to crawl into the company wagon. Our new commander soon dropped  on the kindness of the teamster, and put an end to it without mercy.  The commander was so rough and ungentle, and had so much pomposity and  assurance, that the whole command was disgusted, and almost all were  angry. He ordered the sick out of the wagons, and directed that before  they could ride they must be reported by the doctor as unable to walk,  and had to take a dose of the doctor's drugs from his old rusty spoon.  We soon began to realize that we had fallen into bad hands.    The doctor often talked to the men as though they were brutes. He was  very unfeeling, and the men would not respond to his sick"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54335"],[0,"The Women of Mormondom (#11)"],[1,"might at once have concluded.    There was thus something of mystery about the solitary sleigh and its  occupants.    A chariot with a destiny in it--a very primitive chariot of peace, but  a chariot with a charm about it. The driver might have felt akin to the  boatman who embarked with the imperial Roman: \"Fear not--Caesar is in  thy boat!\"    The sleigh wended its course through the streets of Kirtland until it  came to the store of Messrs. Gilbert & Whitney, merchants. There it  stopped.    Leaping from the primitive vehicle the personage shook himself lightly,  as a young lion rising from his restful attitude; for the man possessed  a royal strength and a magnificent physique. In age he was scarcely  more than twenty-five; young, but with the stamp of one born to command.    Leaving his wife in the sleigh, he walked, with a royal bearing and a  wonderfully firm step, straight into the store of Gilbert & Whitney.  His bearing could not be other. He planted his foot as one who never  turned back--as one destined to make a mark in the great world at his  every footfall. He had come to Kirtland as though to possess it.    Going up to the counter where stood the merchant Whitney, he tapped  him with hearty affection on the shoulder as he would have done to a  long separated brother or a companion of by-gone years. There was the  magnetism of love in his very touch. Love was the wondrous charm that  the man carried about him.    \"Well, Brother Whitney, how do you do?\" was his greeting.    \"You have the advantage of me,\" replied Whitney, wondering who his  visitor could be. \"I could not call you by name.\"    \"I am Joseph, the prophet!\"    It was like one of old making himself known to his brethren--\"I am  Joseph, your brother!\"    \"Well, what do you want of me?\" Joseph asked with a smile; and then  with grave solicitude added:    \"You have prayed me here, now what do you want of me? The Lord would  not let me sleep at nights; but said, up and take your wife to  Kirtland!\"    An archangel's coming would not have been a greater event to the saints  than the coming of Joseph the prophet.    Leaving his store and running across the road to his house, Elder  Whitney exclaimed:    \"Who do you think was in that sleigh at the store?\"    \"Well, I don't know,\" replied Sister Whitney.    \"Why, it is Joseph and his wife. Where shall we put them?\"    Then came to the mind of Sister Whitney the vision of the cloud that  had overshadowed her house at midnight, and the words of the angel who  had spoken from the pavilion of his hidden glory. The vision had now to  them a meaning and fulfillment indeed. The sister and her husband who  had heard the \"voice\" felt that \"the word of the Lord\" was to be given  to Kirtland in their own dwelling and under the very roof thus hallowed.    One-half of the house was immediately set apart for the prophet and his  wife. The sleigh drove up to the door and Joseph entered with Emma--the  \"elect lady\" of the church--and they took up their home in the little  city which, with his presence, was now Zion.    It was the controversy of these two powers in the churches in the West  which had called Joseph to Kirtland in the opening of the year 1831.  The church in the State of New York--its birthplace--had been commanded  by revelation to move West, but Joseph hastened ahead with his wife, as  we have seen.    He had been troubled at nights in his visions. He had seen Elder  Whitney and his wife and the good saints praying for his help. This  is how he had known \"Brother Whitney\" at sight; for Joseph on such  occasions saw all things before him as by a map unfolded to his view.    \"Up and take your wife to Kirtland,\" \"the Lord\" had commanded. And he  had come. The church, from the State of New York, followed him the  ensuing May.    The master spirit was in Kirtland now. All spirits were subject to him.  That was one ruling feature of his apostleship. He held the keys of the  dispensation. He commanded and the very invisibles obeyed. _They_ also  recognized the master spirit. He was only subject to the God of Israel.    \"Peace, be still!\" the master commanded, and the troubled waters of  Kirtland were at peace.    There in the chamber which Sister Whitney consecrated to the prophet  the great revelation was given concerning the tests of spirits. There  also many of the revelations were given, some of which form part of the  book of doctrine and covenants. The chamber was thereafter called the  translating room.    Perchance the mystic cloud often overshadowed that house, but the  angel of the new covenant could now enter and speak face to face with  mortal; for Jehovah's prophet dwelt there. To him the heavens unveiled,  and the archangels of celestial spheres appeared in their glory and  administered to him.    Wonderful, indeed, if this be true, of which there is a cloud of  witnesses; and more wonderful still if hosts of angels, good and bad,  have come to earth since that day, converting millions to an age of  revelation, unless one like unto Joseph has indeed unlocked the new  dispensation with an Elijah's keys of power!        CHAPTER IX.    ELIZA R. SNOW'S EXPERIENCE--GLIMPSES OF THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF  JOSEPH SMITH--GATHERING OF THE SAINTS.    \"In the autumn of 1829,\" says Eliza R. Snow, the high priestess, \"the  tidings reached my ears that God had spoken from the heavens; that he  had raised up a prophet, and was about to restore the fullness of the  gospel with all its gifts and powers.    \"During my brief association with the Campbellite church, I was deeply  interested in the study of the ancient prophets, in which I was  assisted by the erudite Alexander Campbell himself, and Walter Scott,  whose acquaintance I made,--but more particularly by Sidney Rigdon, who  was a frequent visitor at my father's house.    \"But when I heard of the mission of the prophet Joseph I was afraid  it was not genuine. It was just what my soul had hungered for, but I  thought it was a hoax.    \"However, I improved the opportunity and attended the first meeting  within my reach. I listened to the testimonials of two of the witnesses  of the Book of Mormon. Such impressive testimonies I had never before  heard. To hear men testify that they had seen a holy angel--that they  had listened to his voice, bearing testimony of the work that was  ushering in a new dispensation; that the fullness of the gospel was to  be restored and that they were commanded to go forth and declare it,  thrilled my inmost soul.    \"Yet it must be remembered that when Joseph Smith was called to his  great mission, more than human power was requisite to convince people  that communication with the invisible world was possible. He was  scoffed at, ridiculed and persecuted for asserting that he had received  a revelation; now the world is flooded with revelations.    \"Early in the spring of 1835, my eldest sister, who, with my mother was  baptized in 1831, by the prophet, returned home from a visit to the  saints in Kirtland, and reported of the faith and humility of those  who had received the gospel as taught by Joseph,--the progress of the  work, the order of the organization of the priesthood and the frequent  manifestations of the power of God.    \"The spirit bore witness to me of the truth. I felt that I had waited  already a little too long to see whether the work was going to 'flash  in the pan' and go out. But my heart was now fixed; and I was baptized  on the 5th of April, 1835. From that day to this I have not doubted the  truth of the work.    \"In December following I went to Kirtland and realized much happiness  in the enlarged views and rich intelligence that flowed from the  fountain of eternal truth, through the inspiration of the Most High.    \"I was present on the memorable event of the dedication of the temple,  when the mighty power of God was displayed, and after its dedication  enjoyed many refreshing seasons in that holy sanctuary. Many times  have I witnessed manifestations of the power of God, in the precious  gifts of the gospel,--such as speaking in tongues, the interpretation  of tongues, prophesying, healing the sick, causing the lame to walk,  the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. Of such  manifestations in the church I might relate many circumstances.    \"In the spring I taught a select school for young ladies, boarding in  the family of the prophet, and at the close of the term returned to my  father's house, where my friends and acquaintances flocked around me  to inquire about the 'strange people' with whom I was associated. I  was exceedingly happy in testifying of what I had both seen and heard,  until the 1st of January, 1837, when I bade a final adieu to the home  of my youth, to share the fortunes of the people of God.    \"On my return to Kirtland, by solicitation, I took up my residence in  the family of the prophet, and taught his family school.    \"Again I had ample opportunity of judging of his daily walk and  conversation, and the more I made his acquaintance, the more cause I  found to appreciate him in his divine calling. His lips ever flowed  with instruction and kindness; but, although very forgiving, indulgent  and affectionate in his nature, when his godlike intuition suggested  that the good of his brethren, or the interests of the kingdom of God  demanded it, no fear of censure, no love of approbation, could prevent  his severe and cutting rebukes.    \"His expansive mind grasped the great plan of salvation, and solved  the mystic problem of man's destiny; he was in possession of keys that  unlocked the past and the future, with its successions of eternities;  yet in his devotions he was as humble as a little child. Three times  a day he had family worship; and these precious seasons of sacred  household service truly seemed a foretaste of celestial happiness.\"    Thus commenced that peculiar and interesting relationship between the  prophet and the inspired"]]]
