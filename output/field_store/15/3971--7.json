[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],[0,"The Head of Kay's (#11)"],[1,"you're_ going to have.\"    Kennedy spent the half-hour before going to bed in unpacking his box  for the second time, and arranging his books and photographs in the  study which had been Wayburn's. He had nothing to find fault with in  the study. It was as large as the one he had owned at Blackburn's,  and, like it, looked out over the school grounds.    At half-past ten the gas gave a flicker and went out, turned off at  the main. Kennedy lit a candle and made his way to his dormitory.  There now faced him the more than unpleasant task of introducing  himself to its inmates. He knew from experience the disconcerting way  in which a dormitory greets an intruder. It was difficult to know how  to begin matters. It would take a long time, he thought, to explain  his presence to their satisfaction.    Fortunately, however, the dormitory was not unprepared. Things get  about very quickly in a house. The matron had told the housemaids; the  housemaids had handed it on to their ally, the boot boy; the boot boy  had told Wren, whom he happened to meet in the passage, and Wren had  told everybody else.    There was an uproar going on when Kennedy opened the door, but it died  away as he appeared, and the dormitory gazed at the newcomer in  absolute and embarrassing silence. Kennedy had not felt so conscious  of the public eye being upon him since he had gone out to bat against  the M.C.C., on his first appearance in the ranks of the Eckleton  eleven. He went to his bed and began to undress without a word,  feeling rather than seeing the eyes that were peering at him. When he  had completed the performance of disrobing, he blew out the candle and  got into bed. The silence was broken by numerous coughs, of that  short, suggestive type with which the public schoolboy loves to  embarrass his fellow man. From some unidentified corner of the room  came a subdued giggle. Then a whispered, \"Shut _up_, you fool!\"  To which a low voice replied, \"All _right,_ I'm not doing  anything.\"    More coughs, and another outbreak of giggling from a fresh quarter.    \"Good night,\" said Kennedy, to the room in general.    There was no reply. The giggler appeared to be rapidly approaching  hysterics.    \"Shut up that row,\" said Kennedy.    The giggling ceased.    The atmosphere was charged with suspicion. Kennedy fell asleep fearing  that he was going to have trouble with his dormitory before many  nights had passed.          X    FURTHER EXPERIENCES OF AN EXILE      Breakfast on the following morning was a repetition of the dormitory  ordeal. Kennedy walked to his place on Mr Kay's right, feeling that  everyone was looking at him, as indeed they were. He understood for  the first time the meaning of the expression, \"the cynosure of all  eyes\". He was modest by nature, and felt his position a distinct  trial.    He did not quite know what to say or do with regard to his new  house-master at this their first meeting in the latter's territory.  \"Come aboard, sir,\" occurred to him for a moment as a happy phrase,  but he discarded it. To make the situation more awkward, Mr Kay did  not observe him at first, being occupied in assailing a riotous fag at  the other end of the table, that youth having succeeded, by a  dexterous drive in the ribs, in making a friend of his spill half a  cup of coffee. Kennedy did not know whether to sit down without a word  or to remain standing until Mr Kay had time to attend to him. He would  have done better to have sat down; Mr Kay's greeting, when it came,  was not worth waiting for.    \"Sit down, Kennedy,\" he said, irritably--rebuking people on an empty  stomach always ruffled him. \"Sit down, sit down.\"    Kennedy sat down, and began to toy diffidently with a sausage,  remembering, as he did so, certain diatribes of Fenn's against the  food at Kay's. As he became more intimate with the sausage, he  admitted to himself that Fenn had had reason. Mr Kay meanwhile pounded  away in moody silence at a plate of kidneys and bacon. It was one of  the many grievances which gave the Kayite material for conversation  that Mr Kay had not the courage of his opinions in the matter of food.  He insisted that he fed his house luxuriously, but he refused to brave  the mysteries of its bill of fare himself.    Fenn had not come down when Kennedy went in to breakfast. He arrived  some ten minutes later, when Kennedy had vanquished the sausage, and  was keeping body and soul together with bread and marmalade.    \"I cannot have this, Fenn,\" snapped Mr Kay; \"you must come down in  time.\"    Fenn took the rebuke in silence, cast one glance at the sausage which  confronted him, and then pushed it away with such unhesitating  rapidity that Mr Kay glared at him as if about to take up the cudgels  for the rejected viand. Perhaps he remembered that it scarcely  befitted the dignity of a house-master to enter upon a wrangle with a  member of his house on the subject of the merits and demerits of  sausages, for he refrained, and Fenn was allowed to go on with his  meal in peace.    Kennedy's chief anxiety had been with regard to Fenn. True, the latter  could hardly blame him for being made head of Kay's, since he had not  been consulted in the matter, and, if he had been, would have refused  the post with horror; but nevertheless the situation might cause a  coolness between them. And if Fenn, the only person in the house with  whom he was at all intimate, refused to be on friendly terms, his stay  in Kay's would be rendered worse than even he had looked for.    Fenn had not spoken to him at breakfast, but then there was little  table talk at Kay's. Perhaps the quality of the food suggested such  gloomy reflections that nobody liked to put them into words.    After the meal Fenn ran upstairs to his study. Kennedy followed him,  and opened conversation in his direct way with the subject which he  had come to discuss.    \"I say,\" he said, \"I hope you aren't sick about this. You know I  didn't want to bag your place as head of the house.\"    \"My dear chap,\" said Fenn, \"don't apologise. You're welcome to it.  Being head of Kay's isn't such a soft job that one is keen on sticking  to it.\"    \"All the same--\" began Kennedy.    \"I knew Kay would get at me somehow, of course. I've been wondering  how all the holidays. I didn't think of this. Still, I'm jolly glad  it's happened. I now retire into private life, and look on. I've taken  years off my life sweating to make this house decent, and now I'm  going to take a rest and watch you tearing your hair out over the job.  I'm awfully sorry for you. I wish they'd roped in some other victim.\"    \"But you're still a house prefect, I suppose?\"    \"I believe so, Kay couldn't very well make me a fag again.\"    \"Then you'll help manage things?\"    Fenn laughed.    \"Will I, by Jove! I'd like to see myself! I don't want to do the heavy  martyr business and that sort of thing, but I'm hanged if I'm going to  take any more trouble over the house. Haven't you any respect for Mr  Kay's feelings? He thinks I can't keep order. Surely you don't want me  to go and shatter his pet beliefs? Anyhow, I'm not going to do it. I'm  going to play 'villagers and retainers' to your 'hero'. If you do  anything wonderful with the house, I shall be standing by ready to  cheer. But you don't catch me shoving myself forward. 'Thank Heaven I  knows me place,' as the butler in the play says.\"    Kennedy kicked moodily at the leg of the chair which he was holding.  The feeling that his whole world had fallen about his ears was  increasing with every hour he spent in Kay's. Last term he and Fenn  had been as close friends as you could wish to see. If he had asked  Fenn to help him in a tight place then, he knew he could have relied  on him. Now his chief desire seemed to be to score off the human race  in general, his best friend included. It was a depressing beginning.    \"Do you know what the sherry said to the man when he was just going to  drink it?\" inquired Fenn. \"It said, '_Nemo me impune lacessit_'.  That's how I feel. Kay went out of his way to give me a bad time when  I was doing my best to run his house properly, so I don't see that I'm  called upon to go out of my way to work for him.\"    \"It's rather rough on me--\" Kennedy began. Then a sudden indignation  rushed through him. Why should he grovel to Fenn? If Fenn chose to  stand out, let him. He was capable of running the house by himself.    \"I don't care,\" he said, savagely. \"If you can't see what a cad you're  making of yourself, I'm not going to try to show you. You can do what  you jolly well please. I'm not dependent on you. I'll make this a  decent house off my own bat without your help. If you like looking on,  you'd better look on. I'll give you something to look at soon.\"    He went out, leaving Fenn with mixed feelings. He would have liked to  have followed him, taken back what he had said, and formed an  offensive alliance against the black sheep of the house--and also,  which was just as important, against the slack sheep, who were good  for nothing, either at work or play. But his bitterness against the  house-master prevented him. He was not going to take his removal from  the leadership of Kay's as if nothing had happened.    Meanwhile, in the dayrooms and studies, the house had been holding  indignation meetings, and at each it had been unanimously resolved  that Kay's had been abominably treated, and that the deposition of  Fenn must not be tolerated. Unfortunately, a house cannot do very much  when it revolts. It can only show its displeasure in little things,  and by an increase of rowdiness. This was the line that Kay's took.  Fenn became a popular hero. Fags, until he kicked them for it, showed  a tendency to cheer him whenever they saw him. Nothing could paint Mr  Kay blacker in the eyes of his house, so that Kennedy came in for all  the odium. The same fags who had cheered Fenn hooted him on one  occasion as he passed the junior dayroom.

Shoeblossom stooped. He seized the frying-pan. He gave it one twirl in  the air. Then, before any one could stop him, he had turned it upside  down over the fire. As has been already remarked, you could never  predict exactly what James Rupert Leather-Twigg would be up to next.    When anything goes out of the frying-pan into the fire, it is usually  productive of interesting by-products. The maxim applies to fat. The  fat was in the fire with a vengeance. A great sheet of flame rushed out  and up. Shoeblossom leaped back with a readiness highly creditable in  one who was not a professional acrobat. The covering of the mantelpiece  caught fire. The flames went roaring up the chimney.    Drummond, cool while everything else was so hot, without a word moved  to the mantelpiece to beat out the fire with a football shirt. Bertie  was talking rapidly to himself in French. Nobody could understand what  he was saying, which was possibly fortunate.    By the time Drummond had extinguished the mantelpiece, Barry had also  done good work by knocking the fire into the grate with the poker.  M'Todd, who had been standing up till now in the far corner of the  room, gaping vaguely at things in general, now came into action.  Probably it was force of habit that suggested to him that the time had  come to upset the kettle. At any rate, upset it he did--most of it over  the glowing, blazing mass in the grate, the rest over Barry. One of the  largest and most detestable smells the study had ever had to endure  instantly assailed their nostrils. The fire in the study was out now,  but in the chimney it still blazed merrily.    \"Go up on to the roof and heave water down,\" said Drummond, the  strategist. \"You can get out from Milton's dormitory window. And take  care not to chuck it down the wrong chimney.\"    Barry was starting for the door to carry out these excellent  instructions, when it flew open.    \"Pah! What have you boys been doing? What an abominable smell. Pah!\"  said a muffled voice. It was Mr Seymour. Most of his face was concealed  in a large handkerchief, but by the look of his eyes, which appeared  above, he did not seem pleased. He took in the situation at a glance.  Fires in the house were not rarities. One facetious sportsman had once  made a rule of setting the senior day-room chimney on fire every term.  He had since left (by request), but fires still occurred.    \"Is the chimney on fire?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Drummond.    \"Go and find Herbert, and tell him to take some water on to the roof  and throw it down.\" Herbert was the boot and knife cleaner at  Seymour's.    Barry went. Soon afterwards a splash of water in the grate announced  that the intrepid Herbert was hard at it. Another followed, and  another. Then there was a pause. Mr Seymour thought he would look up to  see if the fire was out. He stooped and peered into the darkness, and,  even as he gazed, splash came the contents of the fourth pail, together  with some soot with which they had formed a travelling acquaintance on  the way down. Mr Seymour staggered back, grimy and dripping. There was  dead silence in the study. Shoeblossom's face might have been seen  working convulsively.    The silence was broken by a hollow, sepulchral voice with a strong  Cockney accent.    \"Did yer see any water come down then, sir?\" said the voice.    Shoeblossom collapsed into a chair, and began to sob feebly.           *       *       *       *       *    \"--disgraceful ... scandalous ... get _up_, Leather-Twigg ... not to  be trusted ... _babies_ ... three hundred lines, Leather-Twigg ...  abominable ... surprised ... ought to be ashamed of yourselves ...  _double_, Leather-Twigg ... not fit to have studies ... atrocious ...--\"    Such were the main heads of Mr Seymour's speech on the situation as he  dabbed desperately at the soot on his face with his handkerchief.  Shoeblossom stood and gurgled throughout. Not even the thought of six  hundred lines could quench that dauntless spirit.    \"Finally,\" perorated Mr Seymour, as he was leaving the room, \"as you  are evidently not to be trusted with rooms of your own, I forbid you to  enter them till further notice. It is disgraceful that such a thing  should happen. Do you hear, Barry? And you, Drummond? You are not to  enter your studies again till I give you leave. Move your books down to  the senior day-room tonight.\"    And Mr Seymour stalked off to clean himself.    \"Anyhow,\" said Shoeblossom, as his footsteps died away, \"we saved the  sausages.\"    It is this indomitable gift of looking on the bright side that makes us  Englishmen what we are.          XI    THE HOUSE-MATCHES      It was something of a consolation to Barry and his friends--at any  rate, to Barry and Drummond--that directly after they had been evicted  from their study, the house-matches began. Except for the Ripton match,  the house-matches were the most important event of the Easter term.  Even the sports at the beginning of April were productive of less  excitement. There were twelve houses at Wrykyn, and they played on the  \"knocking-out\" system. To be beaten once meant that a house was no  longer eligible for the competition. It could play \"friendlies\" as much  as it liked, but, play it never so wisely, it could not lift the cup.  Thus it often happened that a weak house, by fluking a victory over a  strong rival, found itself, much to its surprise, in the semi-final, or  sometimes even in the final. This was rarer at football than at  cricket, for at football the better team generally wins.    The favourites this year were Donaldson's, though some fancied  Seymour's. Donaldson's had Trevor, whose leadership was worth almost  more than his play. In no other house was training so rigid. You could  tell a Donaldson's man, if he was in his house-team, at a glance. If  you saw a man eating oatmeal biscuits in the shop, and eyeing wistfully  the while the stacks of buns and pastry, you could put him down as a  Donaldsonite without further evidence. The captains of the other houses  used to prescribe a certain amount of self-abnegation in the matter of  food, but Trevor left his men barely enough to support life--enough,  that is, of the things that are really worth eating. The consequence  was that Donaldson's would turn out for an important match all muscle  and bone, and on such occasions it was bad for those of their opponents  who had been taking life more easily. Besides Trevor they had Clowes,  and had had bad luck in not having Paget. Had Paget stopped, no other  house could have looked at them. But by his departure, the strength of  the team had become more nearly on a level with that of Seymour's.    Some even thought that Seymour's were the stronger. Milton was as good  a forward as the school possessed. Besides him there were Barry and  Rand-Brown on the wings. Drummond was a useful half, and five of the  pack had either first or second fifteen colours. It was a team that  would take some beating.    Trevor came to that conclusion early. \"If we can beat Seymour's, we'll  lift the cup,\" he said to Clowes.    \"We'll have to do all we know,\" was Clowes' reply.    They were watching Seymour's pile up an immense score against a scratch  team got up by one of the masters. The first round of the competition  was over. Donaldson's had beaten Templar's, Seymour's the School House.  Templar's were rather stronger than the School House, and Donaldson's  had beaten them by a rather larger score than that which Seymour's had  run up in their match. But neither Trevor nor Clowes was inclined to  draw any augury from this. Seymour's had taken things easily after  half-time; Donaldson's had kept going hard all through.    \"That makes Rand-Brown's fourth try,\" said Clowes, as the wing  three-quarter of the second fifteen raced round and scored in the  corner.    \"Yes. This is the sort of game he's all right in. The man who's marking  him is no good. Barry's scored twice, and both good tries, too.\"    \"Oh, there's no doubt which is the best man,\" said Clowes. \"I only  mentioned that it was Rand-Brown's fourth as an item of interest.\"    The game continued. Barry scored a third try.    \"We're drawn against Appleby's next round,\" said Trevor. \"We can manage  them all right.\"    \"When is it?\"    \"Next Thursday. Nomads' match on Saturday. Then Ripton, Saturday week.\"    \"Who've Seymour's drawn?\"    \"Day's. It'll be a good game, too. Seymour's ought to win, but they'll  have to play their best. Day's have got some good men.\"    \"Fine scrum,\" said Clowes.  \"Yes. Quick in the open, too, which is  always good business. I wish they'd beat Seymour's.\"    \"Oh, we ought to be all right, whichever wins.\"    Appleby's did not offer any very serious resistance to the Donaldson  attack. They were outplayed at every point of the game, and, before  half-time, Donaldson's had scored their thirty points. It was a rule in  all in-school matches--and a good rule, too--that, when one side led by  thirty points, the match stopped. This prevented those massacres which  do so much towards crushing all the football out of the members of the  beaten team; and it kept the winning team from getting slack, by urging  them on to score their thirty points before half-time. There were some  houses--notoriously slack--which would go for a couple of seasons  without ever playing the second half of a match.    Having polished off the men of Appleby, the Donaldson team trooped off  to the other game to see how Seymour's were getting on with Day's. It  was evidently an exciting match. The first half had been played to the  accompaniment of much shouting from the ropes. Though coming so early  in the competition, it was really the semi-final, for whichever team  won would be almost certain to get into the final. The school had  turned"]]]
