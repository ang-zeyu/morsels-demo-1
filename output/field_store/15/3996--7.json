But these chiefs were not allowed to come forward; and it  seems to have been the policy of Egypt to keep the Syrians off as much  as possible, not a single man who came with Sanehat being allowed to  cross the frontier. The allusion to the Tenu belonging to Pharaoh,  like his dogs, is peculiarly fitting to this period, as the dog seems  to have been more familiarly domesticated in the XIth and XIIth  Dynasties than at any other age, and dogs are often then represented  on the funereal steles, even with their names.    The expression for strangeness--\"as a man of the Delta sees himself at  the cataract, as a man of the plain who sees himself in the deserts\"--is  true to this day. Nothing upsets an Egyptian's self-reliance like going  back a few miles into the desert; and almost any man of the cultivated  plain will flee with terror if he finds himself left alone far in the  desert, or even taken to the top of the desert hills..    We learn incidentally that the Egyptian frontier, even in the later  years of Usertesen I., had not been pushed beyond the Wady Tumilat; for  Sanehat travels south to the Roads of Horus, where he finds the frontier  garrison, and leaves his Syrian friends; and there laden boats meet him,  showing that it must have been somewhere along a waterway from the Nile.    The abasement of Sanehat might well be due to natural causes, beside the  reverence for the divine person of the king. The Egyptian court must  have seemed oppressively splendid, with the brilliant and costly  workmanship of Usertesen, to one who had lived a half-wild life for so  many years; and, more than that, the recalling of all his early days and  habits and friendships would overwhelm his mind and make it difficult to  collect his thoughts.    Sanehat's appearance was so much changed by his long hair, his age, and  his strange dress, that his former mistress and companions could not  recognise him. The use of collars and sceptres in the song and dance  is not clear to us. The sistra were, of course, to beat or rattle in  time with the song; the sceptres or wands were perhaps the same as the  engraved wands of ivory common in the XIIth Dynasty, or of blue glazed  ware in XVIIIth, and would be used to wave or beat time with; but the  use of the collar and counterpoise, or _menat,_ is unexplained, though  figures of dancers are shown holding a collar and _menat,_ and such  objects were found buried in the ceremonial foundation deposit of  Tahutmes III. at Koptos.    This song of the princesses is clearly in parallel phrases. First are  four wishes for the king and queen, in four lines. Second, an ascription  of wisdom and power, in two lines. Third, a comparison of the king to  Ra, and of the queen to the great goddess, in two lines. Fourth, an  ascription of righting power. Fifth, a petition for Sanehat, winding up  with the statement of fear inspired by the king, as explaining  Sanehat's abasement. To this the king responds by reassuring Sanehat,  and promising him position and wealth.    The account of Sanehat's renewal of his old national ways can best be  appreciated by any one who has lived a rough life for a time and then  comes back to civilisation. Doubtless these comforts were all the more  grateful to him in his old age, when he was weary of his unsettled life.    In the preparation of his tomb it is stated to have been a pyramid, with  rock-cut well chamber, and built of bricks above. This just accords  with the construction of the pyramids of the XIIth Dynasty.    The last phrase implies that this was composed during Sanehat's life;  and such a life would be so remarkable that this biography might be  prepared with good reason. Also it is very unlikely that a mere  story-teller would have dropped the relation without describing his  grand funeral which was promised to him. From suddenly stopping at the  preparation of the tomb, without going further, we have a strong  presumption that this was a true narrative, written at Sanehat's  dictation, and probably intended to be inscribed on his tomb wall. In  any case, we have here an invaluable picture of life in Palestine and  in Egypt, and the relations of the two countries, at an epoch before  the time of Abraham, and not paralleled by any other document until  more than a thousand years later."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],[0,"A Crystal Age (#11)"],[1,"that her words had not been overheard; and presently,  recovering from my fright, I apologized for hurting her, and hoped she  would forgive me.    \"There is nothing to forgive,\" she returned gently. \"You did not really  squeeze hard, only my hand hurts, because to-day when I pressed it on  the ground beside the grave I ran a small thorn into it.\" Then the  remembrance of that scene at the burial brought a sudden mist of tears  into her lovely eyes.    \"I am so sorry I hurt you, Yoletta--may I call you Yoletta?\" said I, all  at once remembering that she had called me Smith, without the customary  prefix.    \"Why, that is my name--what else should you call me?\" she returned,  evidently with surprise.    \"It is a pretty name, and so sweet on the lips that I should like to be  repeating it continually,\" I answered. \"But it is only right that you  should have a pretty name, because--well, if I may tell you, because you  are so very beautiful.\"    \"Yes; but is that strange--are not all people beautiful?\"    I thought of certain London types, especially among the \"criminal  classes,\" and of the old women with withered, simian faces and wearing  shawls, slinking in or out of public-houses at the street corners; and  also of some people of a better class I had known personally--some even  in the House of Commons; and I felt that I could not agree with her,  much as I wished to do so, without straining my conscience.    \"At all events, you will allow,\" said I, evading the question, \"that  there are _degrees_ of beauty, just as there are degrees of light.  You may be able to see to work in this light, but it is very faint  compared with the noonday light when the sun is shining.\"    \"Oh, there is not so great a difference between people as _that_,\"  she replied, with the air of a philosopher. \"There are different kinds  of beauty, I allow, and some people seem more beautiful to us than  others, but that is only because we love them more. The best loved are  always the most beautiful.\"    This seemed to reverse the usual idea, that the more beautiful the  person is the more he or she gets loved. However, I was not going to  disagree with her any more, and only said: \"How sweetly you talk,  Yoletta; you are as wise as you are beautiful. I could wish for no  greater pleasure than to sit here listening to you the whole evening.\"    \"Ah, then, I am sorry I must leave you now,\" she answered, with a bright  smile which made me think that perhaps my little speech had pleased her.    \"Do you wonder why I smile?\" she added, as if able to read my thoughts.  \"It is because I have often heard words like yours from one who is  waiting for me now.\"    This speech caused me a jealous pang. But for a few moments after  speaking, she continued regarding me with that bright, spiritual smile  on her lips; then it faded, and her face clouded and her glance fell. I  did not ask her to tell me, nor did I ask myself, the reason of that  change; and afterwards how often I noticed that same change in her, and  in the others too--that sudden silence and clouding of the face, such as  may be seen in one who freely expresses himself to a person who cannot  hear, and then, all at once but too late, remembers the other's  infirmity.    \"Must you go?\" I only said. \"What shall I do alone?\".    \"Oh, you shall not be alone,\" she replied, and going away returned  presently with another lady. \"This is Edra,\" she said simply. \"She will  take my place by your side and talk with you.\"    I could not tell her that she had taken my words too literally, that  being alone simply meant being separated from her; but there was no help  for it, and some one, alas! some one I greatly hated was waiting for  her. I could only thank her and her friend for their kind intentions.  But what in the name of goodness was I to say to this beautiful woman  who was sitting by me? She was certainly very beautiful, with a far more  mature and perhaps a nobler beauty than Yoletta's, her age being about  twenty-seven or twenty-eight; but the divine charm in the young girl's  face could, for me, exist in no other.    Presently she opened the conversation by asking me if I disliked being  alone.    \"Well, no, perhaps not exactly that,\" I said; \"but I think it much  jollier--much more pleasant, I mean--to have some very nice person to  talk to.\"    She assented, and, pleased at her ready intelligence, I added: \"And it  is particularly pleasant when you are understood. But I have no fear  that you, at any rate, will fail to understand anything I may say.\"    \"You have had some trouble to-day,\" she returned, with a charming smile.  \"I sometimes think that women can understand even more readily than  men.\"    \"There's not a doubt of it!\" I returned warmly, glad to find that with  Edra it was all plain sailing. \"It must be patent to every one that  women have far quicker, finer intellects than men, although their brains  are smaller; but then quality is more important than mere quantity. And  yet,\" I continued, \"some people hold that women ought not to have the  franchise, or suffrage, or whatever it is! Not that I care two straws  about the question myself, and I only hope they'll never get it; but  then I think it is so illogical--don't you?\"    \"I am afraid I do not understand you, Smith,\" she returned, looking much  distressed.    \"Well, no, I suppose not, but what I said was of no consequence,\" I  replied; then, wishing to make a fresh start, I added: \"But I am so glad  to hear you call me Smith. It makes it so much more pleasant and  homelike to be treated without formality. It is very kind of you, I'm  sure.\"    \"But surely your name is Smith?\" said she, looking very much surprised.    \"Oh yes, my name is Smith: only of course--well, the tact is, I was just  wondering what to call you.\"    \"My name is Edra,\" she replied, looking more bewildered than ever; and  from that moment the conversation, which had begun so favorably, was  nothing but a series of entanglements, from which I could only escape in  each case by breaking the threads of the subject under discussion, and  introducing a new one.              Chapter 7    The moment of retiring, to which I had been looking forward with  considerable interest as one likely to bring fresh surprises, arrived at  last: it brought only extreme discomfort. I was conducted (without a  flat candlestick) along an obscure passage; then, at right angles with  the first, a second broader, lighter passage, leading past a great many  doors placed near together. These, I ascertained later, were the  dormitories, or sleeping-cells, and were placed side by side in a row  opening on the terrace at the back of the house. Having reached the door  of my box, my conductor pushed back the sliding-panel, and when I had  groped my way to the dark interior, closed it again behind me. There was  no light for me except the light of the stars; for directly opposite the  door by which I had entered stood another, open wide to the night, which  was apparently not intended ever to be closed. The prospect was the one  I had already seen--the wilderness sloping to the river, and the glassy  surface of the broad water, reflecting the stars, and the black masses  of large trees. There was no sound save the hooting of an owl in the  distance, and the wailing note of some mournful-minded water-fowl. The  night air blew in cold and moist, which made my bones ache, though they  were not broken; and feeling very sleepy and miserable, I groped about  until I Was rewarded by discovering a narrow bed, or cot of  trellis-work, on which was a hard straw pallet and a small straw pillow;  also, folded small, a kind of woolen sleeping garment. Too tired to keep  out of even such an uninviting bed, I flung off my clothes, and with my  moldy tweeds for only covering I laid me down, but not to sleep. The  misery of it! for although my body was warm--too warm, in fact--the wind  blew on my face and bare feet and legs, and made it impossible to sleep.    About midnight, I was just falling into a doze when a sound as of a  person coming with a series of jumps into the room disturbed me; and  starting up I was horrified to see, sitting on the floor, a great beast  much too big for a dog, with large, erect ears. He was intently watching  me, his round eyes shining like a pair of green phosphorescent globes.  Having no weapon, I was at the brute's mercy, and was about to utter a  loud shout to summon assistance, but as he sat so still I refrained, and  began even to hope that he would go quietly away. Then he stood up, went  back to the door and sniffed audibly at it; and thinking that he was  about to relieve me of his unwelcome presence, I dropped my head on the  pillow and lay perfectly still. Then he turned and glared at me again,  and finally, advancing deliberately to my side, sniffed at my face. It  was all over with me now, I thought, and closing my eyes, and feeling my  forehead growing remarkably moist in spite of the cold, I murmured a  little prayer. When I looked again the brute had vanished, to my  inexpressible relief.    It seemed very astonishing that an animal like a wolf should come into  the house; but I soon remembered that I had seen no dogs about, so that  all kinds of savage, prowling beasts could come in with impunity. It was  getting beyond a joke: but then all this seemed only a fit ending to the  perfectly absurd arrangement into which I had been induced to enter.  \"Goodness gracious!\" I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright on my straw bed,  \"am I a rational being or an inebriated donkey, or what, to have  consented to such a proposal? It is clear that I was not quite in my  right mind when I made the agreement, and I am therefore not morally  bound to observe it. What! be a field laborer, a hewer of wood and  drawer of water, and sleep on a miserable straw mat in an open porch,  with wolves for visitors at all hours of the night, and all for a few  barbarous rags!"]]]
