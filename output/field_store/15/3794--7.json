For in Salzburg everybody or  nobody has to do with music. If I were to undertake it I should  demand free hands. In matters musical the Head Court Chamberlain  should have nothing to say; a cavalier can not be a conductor,  but a conductor can well be a cavalier.\"    (Paris, July 9, 1778.)    129. \"If the Archbishop were to entrust it to me I would soon  make his music famous, that's sure....But I have one request to  make at Salzburg, and that is that I shall not be placed among  the violins where I used to be; I'll never make a fiddler. I will  conduct at the clavier and accompany the arias. It would have  been a good thing if I had secured a written assurance of the  conductorship.\"    (Paris, September 11, 1778, to his father who had urged him to  return to Salzburg to receive an appointment to the  conductorship. Mozart seems to have a premonition of the  treatment which he received later from the Archbishop.)    130. \"I must admit that I should reach Salzburg with a lighter  heart if I were not aware that I have taken service there; it is  only this thought that is intolerable. Put yourself in my place  and think it over. At Salzburg I do not know who or what I am; I  am everything and at times nothing. I do not demand too much or  too little;--only something, if I am something.\"    (Strassburg, October 15, 1778, to his father, while returning  from Paris filled with repugnance to the Archbishop. \"For aside  from obeying a praiseworthy and beautiful motive\" (he means  filial affection), \"I am really committing the greatest folly in  the world,\" he writes in the same letter.)    131. \"The Archbishop can not recompense me for the slavery in  Salzburg! As I have said I experience great pleasure when I think  of visiting you again, but nothing but vexation and fear at the  thought of seeing myself at that beggarly court again. The  Archbishop must not attempt to put on grand airs with me as he  used to; it is not impossible, it is even likely that I would put  my fingers to my nose,--and I know full well that you would enjoy  it as much as I.\"    (Mannheim, November 12, 1778, to his father.)    132. \"At 11 o'clock in the forenoon, a little too early for me,  unfortunately, we already go to table; we dine together,--the two  temporal and spiritual valets, Mr. the Controller, Mr. Zetti, the  Confectioner, Messrs. the two cooks, Ceccarelli, Brunetti and my  insignificance. N.B. The two valets sit at the head of the table;  I have at least the honor of sitting above the cooks. Well, I  simply think I am at Salzburg. At dinner a great many coarse and  silly jokes are cracked, but not at me, because I do not speak a  word unless of necessity and then always with the utmost  seriousness. As soon as I have dined I go my way.\"    (Vienna, March 17, 1781, to his father. The Archbishop was  visiting Vienna and had brought with him his best musicians whom,  however, he treated shabbily. At length the rupture came; Mozart  was dismissed--literally with a kick.)    133. \"Believe me, best of fathers, that I must summon all my  manhood to write to you what reason commands. God knows how hard  it is for me to leave you; but if beggary were my lot I would no  longer serve such a master; for that I shall never forget as long  as I live,--and I beg of you, I beg of you for the sake of  everything in the world, encourage me in my determination instead  of trying to dissuade me. That would unfit me for what I must do.  For it is my desire and hope to win honor, fame and money, and I  hope to be of greater service to you in Vienna than in Salzburg.\"    (Vienna, May 12, 1781, to his father.)    134. \"I did not know that I was a valet de chambre, and that  broke my neck. I ought to have wasted a few hours every forenoon  in the antechamber. I was often told that I should let myself be  seen, but I could not recall that this was my duty and came  punctually only when the Archbishop summoned me.\"    (Vienna, May 12, 1781.)    135. \"To please you, best of fathers, I would sacrifice my  happiness, my health and my life; but my honor is my own, and  ought to be above all else to you. Let Count Arco and all  Salzburg read this letter.\"    (Vienna, May 19, 1781. It was Count Arco who had dismissed Mozart  with a kick. The father was thrown into consternation at the  maltreatment of his son and sought to persuade Mozart to return  to Salzburg. Mozart replied: \"Best, dearest father, ask of me  anything you please but not that; the very thought makes me  tremble with rage.\")    136. \"You did not think when you wrote this that such a back-step  would stamp me as one of the most contemptible fellows in the  world. All Vienna knows that I have left the Archbishop, knows  why, knows that it is because of my injured honor, of an injury  inflicted three times,--and I am to make a public denial,  proclaim myself a cur and the Archbishop a noble prince? No man  could do the former, least of all I, and the second can only be  done by God if He should choose to enlighten him.\"    (Vienna, May 19, 1781, to his father, who had asked him to return  to the service of the Archbishop.)    137. \"If it be happiness to be rid of a prince who never pays  one, but torments him to death, then I am happy. For if I had to  work from morning till night I would do it gladly rather than  live off the bounty of such a,--I do not dare to call him by the  name he deserves,--I was forced to take the step I did and I can  not swerve a hair's breadth from it; impossible.\"    (Vienna, May 19, 1781.)    138. \"Salzburg is nothing now to me except it offer an  opportunity to give the Count a kick...even if it were in the  public street. I desire no satisfaction from the Archbishop, for  he is not in a position to offer me the kind that I want and must  have. Within a day or two I shall write to the Count telling him  what he can confidently expect to receive from me the first time  I meet him, be it where it may, except a place that commands my  respect.\"    (Vienna, June 13, 1781, to his father. Count Arco's offence has  been mentioned. On June 16 Mozart wrote: \"The hungry ass shall  not escape my chastisement if I have to wait twenty years; for as  soon as I see him he shall come in contact with my foot, unless I  should be so unfortunate as to see him in the sanctuary.\" [The  reader will probably guess that the translator is resorting to  euphemisms in rendering Mozart's language. H.E.K.])    139. \"It is the heart that confers the patent of nobility on man;  and although I am no count I probably have more honor within me  than many a count. Menial or count, whoever insults me is a cur.  I shall begin by representing to him, with complete gravity, how  badly he did his business, but at the end I shall have to assure  him in writing that he is to expect a kick...and a box on the  ear from me; for if a man insults me I have got to be revenged,  and if I give him no more than he gave me, it is mere retaliation  and not punishment. Besides I should thus put myself on a level  with him, and I am too proud to compare myself with such a stupid  gelding.\"    (Vienna, June 20, 1781, to his father. These expressions, called  out by the insulting treatment received from the Archbishop and  Count Arco, are in striking contrast to Mozart's habitual  amiability.)    140. \"I can easily believe that the court parasites will look  askance at you, but why need you disturb yourself about such a  miserable pack? The more inimical such persons are to you the  greater the pride and contempt with which you should look down  upon them.\"    (Vienna, June 20, 1778, to his father, who fears that some of the  consequences of his son's step may be visited upon him.)    141. \"I do not ask of you that you make a disturbance or enter  the least complaint, but the Archbishop and the whole pack must  fear to speak to you about this matter, for you (if compelled)  can without the slightest alarm say frankly that you would be  ashamed to have reared a son who would have accepted abuse from  such an infamous cur as Arco; and you may assure all that if I  had the good luck to meet him today I should treat him as he  deserves, and that he would have occasion to remember me the  rest of his life. All that I want is that everybody shall see  in your bearing that you have nothing to fear. Keep quiet; but  if necessary, speak, and then to some purpose.\"    (Vienna, July 4, 1781, to his father.)    142. \"I may say that because of Vogler, Winter was always my  greatest enemy. But because he is a beast in his mode of life,  and in all other matters a child, I would be ashamed to set down  a single word on his account; he deserves the contempt of all  honorable men. I will, therefore, not tell infamous truths rather  than infamous lies about him.\"    (Vienna, December 22, 1781, to his father, to whose ears Peter  Winter, a composer, had brought slanderous reports concerning  Mozart and his Constanze.

She  (the daughter) is not satisfied if I spend two hours every day  with her, but wants me to loll about the whole day; yet she tries  to play the well behaved one.\"    (Vienna, August 22, 1781, to his father.

NOTES    None.        LUCA DELLA ROBBIA    [63] THE Italian sculptors of the earlier half of the fifteenth  century are more than mere forerunners of the great masters of its  close, and often reach perfection, within the narrow limits which  they chose to impose on their work.  Their sculpture shares with  the paintings of Botticelli and the churches of Brunelleschi that  profound expressiveness, that intimate impress of an indwelling  soul, which is the peculiar fascination of the art of Italy in that  century.  Their works have been much neglected, and often  almost hidden away amid the frippery of modern decoration, and  we come with some surprise on the places where their fire still  smoulders.  One longs to penetrate into the lives of the men who  have given expression to so much power and sweetness.  But it is  part of the reserve, the austere dignity and simplicity of their  existence, that their histories are for the most part lost, or told but  briefly.  From their lives, as from their work, all tumult of sound  and colour has passed away.  Mino, the Raphael of sculpture,  Maso del Rodario, whose works add a further grace to [64] the  church of Como, Donatello even,--one asks in vain for more than  a shadowy outline of their actual days.    Something more remains of Luca della Robbia; something more  of a history, of outward changes and fortunes, is expressed  through his work.  I suppose nothing brings the real air of a  Tuscan town so vividly to mind as those pieces of pale blue and  white earthenware, by which he is best known, like fragments of  the milky sky itself, fallen into the cool streets, and breaking into  the darkened churches.  And no work is less imitable: like Tuscan  wine, it loses its savour when moved from its birthplace, from the  crumbling walls where it was first placed.  Part of the charm of  this work, its grace and purity and finish of expression, is  common to all the Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth century; for  Luca was first of all a worker in marble, and his works in terra  cotta only transfer to a different material the principles of his  sculpture.    These Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth century worked for the  most part in low relief, giving even to their monumental effigies  something of its depression of surface, getting into them by this  means a pathetic suggestion of the wasting and etherealisation of  death.  They are haters of all heaviness and emphasis, of  strongly-opposed light and shade, and seek their means of  delineation among those last refinements of shadow, which are  almost invisible except in a strong [65] light, and which the finest  pencil can hardly follow.  The whole essence of their work is  expression, the passing of a smile over the face of a child, the  ripple of the air on a still day over the curtain of a window ajar.    What is the precise value of this system of sculpture, this low  relief?  Luca della Robbia, and the other sculptors of the school  to which he belongs, have before them the universal problem of  their art; and this system of low relief is the means by which they  meet and overcome the special limitation of sculpture.    That limitation results from the material and other necessary  conditions of all sculptured work, and consists in the tendency of  such work to a hard realism, a one-sided presentment of mere  form, that solid material frame which only motion can relieve, a  thing of heavy shadows, and an individuality of expression  pushed to caricature.  Against this tendency to the hard  presentment of mere form trying vainly to compete with the  reality of nature itself, all noble sculpture constantly struggles;  each great system of sculpture resisting it in its own way,  etherealising, spiritualising, relieving its stiffness, its heaviness,  and death.  The use of colour in sculpture is but an unskilful  contrivance to effect, by borrowing from another art, what the  nobler sculpture effects by strictly appropriate means.    To get not colour, but the equivalent of colour; to secure the  expression and the play of life; to [66] expand the too firmly  fixed individuality of pure, unrelieved, uncoloured form:--this is  the problem which the three great styles in sculpture have solved  in three different ways.    Allgemeinheit--breadth, generality, universality,--is the word  chosen by Winckelmann, and after him by Goethe and many  German critics, to express that law of the most excellent Greek  sculptors, of Pheidias and his pupils, which prompted them  constantly to seek the type in the individual, to abstract and  express only what is structural and permanent, to purge from the  individual all that belongs only to him, all the accidents, the  feelings and actions of the special moment, all that (because in its  own nature it endures but for a moment) is apt to look like a  frozen thing if one arrests it.    In this way their works came to be like some subtle extract or  essence, or almost like pure thoughts or ideas: and hence the  breadth of humanity in them, that detachment from the conditions  of a particular place or people, which has carried their influence  far beyond the age which produced them, and insured them  universal acceptance.    That was the Greek way of relieving the hardness and  unspirituality of pure form.  But it involved to a certain degree  the sacrifice of what we call expression; and a system of  abstraction which aimed always at the broad and general type, at  the purging away from the [67] individual of what belonged only  to him, and of the mere accidents of a particular time and place,  imposed upon the range of effects open to the Greek sculptor  limits somewhat narrowly defined.  When Michelangelo came,  therefore, with a genius spiritualised by the reverie of the middle  age, penetrated by its spirit of inwardness and introspection,  living not a mere outward life like the Greek, but a life full of  intimate experiences, sorrows, consolations, a system which  sacrificed so much of what was inward and unseen could not  satisfy him.  To him, lover and student of Greek sculpture as he  was, work which did not bring what was inward to the surface,  which was not concerned with individual expression, with  individual character and feeling, the special history of the special  soul, was not worth doing at all.    And so, in a way quite personal and peculiar to himself, which  often is, and always seems, the effect of accident, he secured for  his work individuality and intensity of expression, while he  avoided a too heavy realism, that tendency to harden into  caricature which the representation of feeling in sculpture is apt  to display.  What time and accident, its centuries of darkness  under the furrows of the \"little Melian farm,\" have done with  singular felicity of touch for the Venus of Melos, fraying its  surface and softening its lines, so that some spirit in the thing  seems always on the point of breaking out, as though [68] in it  classical sculpture had advanced already one step into the  mystical Christian age, its expression being in the whole range of  ancient work most like that of Michelangelo's own:--this effect  Michelangelo gains by leaving nearly all his sculpture in a  puzzling sort of incompleteness, which suggests rather than  realises actual form.  Something of the wasting of that snow-  image which he moulded at the command of Piero de' Medici,  when the snow lay one night in the court of the Pitti palace,  almost always lurks about it, as if he had determined to make the  quality of a task, exacted from him half in derision, the pride of  all his work.  Many have wondered at that incompleteness,  suspecting, however, that Michelangelo himself loved and was  loath to change it, and feeling at the same time that they too  would lose something if the half-realised form ever quite  emerged from the stone, so rough-hewn here, so delicately  finished there; and they have wished to fathom the charm of this  incompleteness.  Well!  That incompleteness is Michelangelo's  equivalent for colour in sculpture; it is his way of etherealising  pure form, of relieving its stiff realism, and communicating to it  breath, pulsation, the effect of life.  It was a characteristic too  which fell in with his peculiar temper and mode of living, his  disappointments and hesitations.  And it was in reality perfect  finish.  In this way he combines the utmost amount of passion  and intensity with [69] the sense of a yielding and flexible life: he  gets not vitality merely, but a wonderful force of expression.    Midway between these two systems--the system of the Greek  sculptors and the system of Michelangelo--comes the system of  Luca della Robbia and the other Tuscan sculptors of the fifteenth  century, partaking both of the Allgemeinheit of the Greeks, their  way of extracting certain select elements only of pure form and  sacrificing all the rest, and the studied incompleteness of  Michelangelo, relieving that sense of intensity, passion, energy,  which might otherwise have stiffened into caricature.  Like  Michelangelo, these sculptors fill their works with intense and  individualised expression.  Their noblest works are the careful  sepulchral portraits of particular persons--the monument of Conte  Ugo in the Badía of Florence, of the youthful Medea Colleoni,  with the wonderful, long throat, in the chapel on the cool north  side of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Bergamo--  monuments such as abound in the churches of Rome,  inexhaustible in suggestions of repose, of a subdued Sabbatic joy,  a kind of sacred grace and refinement.  And these elements of  tranquillity, of repose, they unite to an intense and individual  expression by a system of conventionalism as skilful and subtle  as that of the Greeks, repressing all such curves as indicate solid  form, and throwing"]]]
