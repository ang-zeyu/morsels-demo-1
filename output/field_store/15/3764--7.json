Corollary.--Hence it follows, that the essence of man is  constituted by certain modifications of the attributes of God.  For (by the last Prop.) the being of substance does not belong to  the essence of man.  That essence therefore (by i.  15) is  something which is in God, and which without God can neither be  nor be conceived, whether it be a modification (i. 25. Coroll.),  or a mode which expresses God's nature in a certain conditioned  manner.    Note.--Everyone must surely admit, that nothing can be or be  conceived without God.  All men agree that God is the one and  only cause of all things, both of their essence and of their  existence; that is, God is not only the cause of things in  respect to their being made (secundum fieri), but also in respect  to their being (secundum esse).    At the same time many assert, that that, without which a  thing cannot be nor be conceived, belongs to the essence of that  thing; wherefore they believe that either the nature of God  appertains to the essence of created things, or else that created  things can be or be conceived without God; or else, as is more  probably the case, they hold inconsistent doctrines.  I think the  cause for such confusion is mainly, that they do not keep to the  proper order of philosophic thinking.  The nature of God, which  should be reflected on first, inasmuch as it is prior both in the  order of knowledge and the order of nature, they have taken to be  last in the order of knowledge, and have put into the first place  what they call the objects of sensation; hence, while they are  considering natural phenomena, they give no attention at all to  the divine nature, and, when afterwards they apply their mind to  the study of the divine nature, they are quite unable to bear in  mind the first hypotheses, with which they have overlaid the  knowledge of natural phenomena, inasmuch as such hypotheses are  no help towards understanding the divine nature.  So that it is  hardly to be wondered at, that these persons contradict  themselves freely.    However, I pass over this point.  My intention her was only  to give a reason for not saying, that that, without which a thing  cannot be or be conceived, belongs to the essence of that thing:  individual things cannot be or be conceived without God, yet God  does not appertain to their essence.  I said that \"I considered  as belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given,  the thing is necessarily given also, and which being removed, the  thing is necessarily removed also; or that without which the  thing, and which itself without the thing can neither be nor be  conceived.\"  (II. Def. ii.)    PROP. XI.  The first element, which constitutes the actual being  of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually  existing.    Proof.--The essence of man (by the Coroll. of the last Prop.)  is constituted by certain modes of the attributes of God, namely  (by II. Ax. ii.), by the modes of thinking, of all which (by II.  Ax. iii.) the idea is prior in nature, and, when the idea is  given, the other modes (namely, those of which the idea is prior  in nature) must be in the same individual (by the same Axiom).  Therefore an idea is the first element constituting the human  mind.  But not the idea of a non--existent thing, for then (II.  viii. Coroll.) the idea itself cannot be said to exist; it must  therefore be the idea of something actually existing.  But not of  an infinite thing.  For an infinite thing (I. xxi., xxii.), must  always necessarily exist; this would (by II. Ax. i.) involve an  absurdity.  Therefore the first element, which constitutes the  actual being of the human mind, is the idea of something actually  existing.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence it follows, that the human mind is part of  the infinite intellect of God; thus when we say, that the human  mind perceives this or that, we make the assertion, that God has  this or that idea, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far  as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind, or in so  far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; and when we  say that God has this or that idea, not only in so far as he  constitutes the essence of the human mind, but also in so far as  he, simultaneously with the human mind, has the further idea of  another thing, we assert that the human mind perceives a thing in  part or inadequately.    Note.--Here, I doubt not, readers will come to a stand, and  will call to mind many things which will cause them to hesitate;  I therefore beg them to accompany me slowly, step by step, and  not to pronounce on my statements, till they have read to the  end.    PROP. XII.  Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea,  which constitutes the human mind, must be perceived by the human  mind, or there will necessarily be an idea in the human mind of  the said occurrence.  That is, if the object of the idea  constituting the human mind be a body, nothing can take place in  that body without being perceived by the mind.    Proof.--Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of any idea,  the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God (II. ix. Coroll.), in  so far as he is considered as affected by the idea of the said  object, that is (II. xi.), in so far as he constitutes the mind  of anything.  Therefore, whatsoever takes place in the object  constituting the idea of the human mind, the knowledge thereof is  necessarily in God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of  the human mind; that is (by II. xi. Coroll.) the knowledge of  the said thing will necessarily be in the mind, in other words  the mind perceives it.    Note.--This proposition is also evident, and is more clearly  to be understood from II. vii., which see.    PROP. XIII.  The object of the idea constituting the human mind  is the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which  actually exists, and nothing else.    Proof.--If indeed the body were not the object of the human  mind, the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in  God (II. ix. Coroll.) in virtue of his constituting our mind, but  in virtue of his constituting the mind of something else; that  is (II. xi. Coroll.) the ideas of the modifications of the body  would not be in our mind: now (by II. Ax. iv.) we do possess the  idea of the modifications of the body.  Therefore the object of  the idea constituting the human mind is the body, and the body as  it actually exists (II. xi.).  Further, if there were any other  object of the idea constituting the mind besides body, then, as  nothing can exist from which some effect does not follow (I.  xxxvi.) there would necessarily have to be in our mind an idea,  which would be the effect of that other object (II. xi.); but  (I. Ax. v.) there is no such idea.  Wherefore the object of our  mind is the body as it exists, and nothing else.  Q.E.D.    Note.--We thus comprehend, not only that the human mind is  united to the body, but also the nature of the union between mind  and body.  However, no one will be able to grasp this adequately  or distinctly, unless he first has adequate knowledge of the  nature of our body.  The propositions we have advanced hitherto  have been entirely general, applying not more to men than to  other individual things, all of which, though in different  degrees, are animated.[3]  For of everything there is necessarily  an idea in God, of which God is the cause, in the same way as  there is an idea of the human body; thus  whatever we have  asserted of the idea of the human body must necessarily also be  asserted of the idea of everything else.  Still, on the other  hand, we cannot deny that ideas, like objects, differ one from  the other, one being more excellent than another and containing  more reality, just as the object of one idea is more excellent  than the object of another idea, and contains more reality.    [3] \"Animata\"      Wherefore, in order to determine, wherein the human mind  differs from other things, and wherein it surpasses them, it is  necessary for us to know the nature of its object, that is, of  the human body.  What this nature is, I am not able here to  explain, nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance,  that I should do so.  I will only say generally, that in  proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing  many actions or receiving many impressions at once, so also is  the mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than others for  forming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions  of the body depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies  concur with it in action, the more fitted is the mind of which it  is the object for distinct comprehension.  We may thus recognize  the superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the  cause, why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body,  and also many kindred questions, which I will, in the following  propositions, deduce from what has been advanced.  Wherefore I  have thought it worth while to explain and prove more strictly my  present statements.  In order to do so, I must premise a few  propositions concerning the nature of bodies.    AXIOM I.  All bodies are either in motion or at rest.    AXIOM II.  Every body is moved sometimes more slowly,  sometimes more quickly.    LEMMA I.  Bodies are distinguished from one another in  respect of motion and rest, quickness and slowness, and not in  respect of substance.    Proof.--The first part of this proposition is, I take it,  self--evident.  That bodies are not distinguished in respect of  substance, is plain both from I. v. and I. viii.  It is brought  out still more clearly from I. xv, note.    LEMMA II.  All bodies agree in certain respects.    Proof.--All bodies agree in the fact, that they involve the  conception of one and the same attribute (II., Def. i.).

Order IV. TOTIPALMATE SWIMMERS.    STEGANOPODES.         Family 1. TROPIC BIRDS. PhaA\"thontidA|. 2 species.       Family 2. GANNETS. SulidA|. 6 species.       Family 3. DARTERS. AnhingidA|. 1 species.       Family 4. CORMORANTS. PhalacrocoracidA|. 6 species, 5 subspecies.       Family 5. PELICANS. PelecanidA|. 3 species.       Family 6. MAN-O'-WAR-BIRDS. FregatidA|. 1 Species.      The members of this Order agree in having all four toes connected by  webs, but in other respects they differ widely in structure and,  consequently, in habit. The young of all the Steganopodes are born  naked, unlike the young of most of the other water birds, which, as a  rule, are hatched covered with feathers and can swim or run about soon  after birth. The nests of the Steganopodes are, of necessity,  therefore, more complex structures than those of birds whose nests are  merely incubators and not cradles as well.    Tropic Birds resemble the larger Terns, when in the air, but their  wing strokes are more rapid. They usually nest in holes in the face of  cliffs, and lay one whitish egg, marked with chocolate.    Gannets are true sea birds, but, as a rule, do not live very far from  the land. When breeding, Gannets are usually associated in great  numbers. Their nests, as a rule, are placed on the ground or on  cliffs, and one or two chalky white eggs are laid. At this season the  birds are exceedingly tame and in localities where they have not been  much molested, one may walk about among the sitting birds without  their taking flight. Gannets are powerful birds on the wing. Their  vigorous wing strokes are interrupted at intervals by short sails.  They feed on fish which they capture by diving from the air.    The Darters or Anhingas number four species, distributed throughout  the tropical parts of the globe, only one species inhabiting America.  This is generally called the Snakebird or Water Turkey in Florida,  where it is a common species on the more isolated rivers and lakes.  The name Snakebird is derived from the bird's habit of swimming with  the body submerged, when the long, sinuous neck, appearing above the  water, readily suggests a snake. At other times Snakebirds mount high  in the air and sail about, like Hawks, in wide circles. They build a  large, well-made nest in a bush or tree, generally over the water, and  lay four bluish white, chalky eggs.    Cormorants nest in large colonies, generally on isolated islets, but  sometimes in remote swamps. The nests are placed closely together on  the ground, in bushes, and less frequently in trees, according to the  nature of the bird's haunts.    Cormorants feed on fish which they catch by pursuing them under the  water. They dive from the surface of the water like Ducks, or from a  low perch, but not from the air, as do the Gannets.    Pelicans nest in colonies, generally on some small island, building  their nests on the ground or in bushes, and laying two or three large,  white, chalky eggs.    Brown Pelicans secure their food by plunging on it from the air,  generally from about twenty feet above the water. The sides of the  bill are then bowed outward, the opening widened, forming, with the  pouch, an effective net in which fish, twelve and fourteen inches  long, are captured.    White Pelicans, on the contrary, feed from the water, scooping up  fishes as they swim. At times a flock of these birds may surround a  school of small fish in shallow water and drive them shoreward, at the  same time actively filling their pouches.    Young Pelicans are fed on fish which they take from the pouch of the  parent bird by thrusting their bills and heads well into it and  prodding actively about for the food to be found there. Young  Cormorants secure their food in a similar manner.    Frigate Birds, of which only two species are known, have a greater  expanse of wing in proportion to the weight of their body than any  other bird. Their power of flight is consequently unexcelled and they  may spend days in the air without tiring. Their feet are as weak as  their wings are strong, and are of use only in perching.    The food of Frigate Birds consists chiefly of fish, which they catch  from near the surface"]]]
