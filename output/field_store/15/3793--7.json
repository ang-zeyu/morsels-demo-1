The  commotion we were making stirred up all the neighbours, who came  crowding round, together with some Roman gentlemen who chanced to pass,  and cried: Do but kill the renegades, and we will stand by you. These  words had the effect of frightening the Spaniards in good earnest. They  withdrew, and were compelled by the circumstances to relate the whole  affair to Monsignor. Being a man of inordinate haughtiness, he rated the  members of his household, both because they had engaged in such an act  of violence, and also because, having begun, they had not gone through  with it. At this juncture the painter, who had been concerned in the  whole matter, came in, and the Bishop bade him go and tell me that if I  did not bring the vase at once, he would make mincemeat of me; [2] but  if I brought it, he would pay its price down. These threats were so far  from terrifying me, that I sent him word I was going immediately to lay  my case before the Pope.    In the meantime, his anger and my fear subsided; whereupon, being  guaranteed by some Roman noblemen of high degree that the prelate would  not harm me, and having assurance that I should be paid, I armed myself  with a large poniard and my good coat of mail, and betook myself to his  palace, where he had drawn up all his household. I entered, and Paulino  followed with the silver vase. It was just like passing through the  Zodiac, neither more nor less; for one of them had the face of the lion,  another of the scorpion, a third of the crab. However, we passed onward  to the presence of the rascally priest, who spouted out a torrent of  such language as only priests and Spaniards have at their command. In  return I never raised my eyes to look at him, nor answered word for  word. That seemed to augment the fury of his anger; and causing paper to  be put before me, he commanded me to write an acknowledgment to the  effect that I had been amply satisfied and paid in full. Then I raised  my head, and said I should be very glad to do so when I had received the  money. The Bishops rage continued to rise; threats and recriminations  were flung about; but at last the money was paid, and I wrote the  receipt. Then I departed, glad at heart and in high spirits.    Note 1. The Italians reckoned time from sundown till sundown, counting  twenty-four hours. Twenty-two oclock was therefore two hours before  nightfall. One hour of the night was one hour after nightfall, and so  forth. By this system of reckoning, it is clear that the hours varied  with the season of the year; and unless we know the exact month in which  an event took place, we cannot translate any hour into terms of our own  system.    Note 2. Lit., the largest piece left of me should be my ears.    XXV    WHEN Pope Clement heard the story-he had seen the vase before, but it  was not shown him as my work-he expressed much pleasure and spoke warmly  in my praise, publicly saying that he felt very favourably toward me.  This caused Monsignor Salamanca to repent that he had hectored over me;  and in order to make up our quarrel, he sent the same painter to inform  me that he meant to give me large commissions. I replied that I was  willing to undertake them, but that I should require to be paid in  advance. This speech too came to Pope Clements ears, and made him laugh  heartily. Cardinal Cibo was in the presence, and the Pope narrated to  him the whole history of my dispute with the Bishop. [1] Then he turned  to one of his people, and ordered him to go on supplying me with work  for the palace. Cardinal Cibo sent for me, and after some time spent in  agreeable conversation, gave me the order for a large vase, bigger than  Salamancas. I likewise obtained commissions from Cardinal Cornaro, and  many others of the Holy College, especially Ridolfi and Salviati; they  all kept me well employed, so that I earned plenty of money. 2    Madonna Porzia now advised me to open a shop of my own. This I did; and  I never stopped working for that excellent and gentle lady, who paid me  exceedingly well, and by whose means perhaps it was that I came to make  a figure in the world.    I contracted close friendship with Signor Gabbriello Ceserino, at that  time Gonfalonier of Rome, and executed many pieces for him. One, among  the rest, is worthy of mention. It was a large golden medal to wear in  the hat. I engraved upon it Leda with her swan; and being very well  pleased with the workmanship, he said he should like to have it valued,  in order that I might be properly paid. Now, since the medal was  executed with consummate skill, the valuers of the trade set a far  higher price on it than he had thought of. I therefore kept the medal,  and got nothing for my pains. The same sort of adventures happened in  this case as in that of Salamancas vase. But I shall pass such matters  briefly by, lest they hinder me from telling things of greater  importance.    Note 1. Innocenzio Cibo Malaspina, Archbishop of Genoa, and nephew of  Lorenzo de Medici. He was a prelate of vast wealth and a great patron  of arts and letters.    Note 2. Marco Cornaro was a brother of Caterina, the Queen of Cyprus. He  obtained the hat in 1492. Niccolò Ridolfi was a nephew of Leo X.  Giovanni Salviati, the son of Jacopo mentioned above, was also a nephew  of Leo X, who gave him the hat in 1517.    XXVI    SINCE I am writing my life, I must from time to time diverge from my  profession in order to describe with brevity, if not in detail, some  incidents which have no bearing on my career as artist. On the morning  of Saint Johns Day I happened to be dining with several men of our  nation, painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, amongst the most notable of  whom was Rosso and Gainfrancesco, the pupil of Raffaello. [1] I had  invited them without restraint or ceremony to the place of our meeting,  and they were all laughing and joking, as is natural when a crowd of men  come together to make merry on so great a festival. It chanced that a  light-brained swaggering young fellow passed by; he was a soldier of  Rienzo da Ceri, who, when he heard the noise that we were making, gave  vent to a string of opprobrious sarcasms upon the folk of Florence. [2]  I, who was the host of those great artists and men of worth, taking the  insult to myself, slipped out quietly without being observed, and went  up to him. I ought to say that he had a punk of his there, and was going  on with his stupid ribaldries to amuse her. When I met him, I asked if  he was the rash fellow who was speaking evil of the Florentines. He  answered at once: I am that man. On this I raised my hand, struck him  in the face, and said: And I am 'this' man. Then we each of us drew  our swords with spirit; but the fray had hardly begun when a crowd of  persons intervened, who rather took my part than not, hearing and seeing  that I was in the right.    On the following day a challenge to fight with him was brought me, which  I accepted very gladly, saying that I expected to complete this job far  quicker than those of the other art I practised. So I went at once to  confer with a fine old man called Bevilacqua, who was reputed to have  been the first sword of Italy, because he had fought more than twenty  serious duels and had always come off with honour. This excellent man  was a great friend of mine; he knew me as an artist and had also been  concerned as intermediary in certain ugly quarrels between me and  others. Accordingly, when he had learned my business, he answered with a  smile: My Benvenuto, if you had an affair with Mars, I am sure you  would come out with honour, because through all the years that I have  known you, I have never seen you wrongfully take up a quarrel. So he  consented to be my second, and we repaired with sword in hand to the  appointed place, but no blood was shed, for my opponent made the matter  up, and I came with much credit out of the affair. [3] I will not add  further particulars; for though they would be very interesting in their  own way, I wish to keep both space and words for my art, which has been  my chief inducement to write as I am doing, and about which I shall have  only too much to say.    The spirit of honourable rivalry impelled me to attempt some other  masterpiece, which should equal, or even surpass, the productions of  that able craftsman, Lucagnolo, whom I have mentioned. Still I did not  on this account neglect my own fine art of jewellery; and so both the  one and the other wrought me much profit and more credit, and in both of  them I continued to produce things of marked originality. There was at  that time in Rome a very able artist of Perugia named Lautizio, who  worked only in one department, where he was sole and unrivalled  throughout the world. [4] You must know that at Rome every cardinal has  a seal, upon which his title is engraved, and these seals are made just  as large as a childs hand of about twelve years of age; and, as I have  already said, the cardinals title is engraved upon the seal together  with a great many ornamental figures. A well-made article of the kind  fetches a hundred, or more than a hundred crowns. This excellent  workman, like Lucagnolo, roused in me some honest rivalry, although the  art he practised is far remote from the other branches of gold-smithery,  and consequently Lautizio was not skilled in making anything but seals.  I gave my mind to acquiring his craft also, although I found it very  difficult; and, unrepelled by the trouble which it gave me, I went on  zealously upon the path of profit and improvement.    There was in Rome another most excellent craftsman of ability, who was a  Milanese named Messer Caradosso. [5] He dealt in nothing but little  chiselled medals, made of plates of metal, and such-like things. I have  seen of his some paxes in half relief, and some Christs a palm in length  wrought of the thinnest golden plates, so exquisitely done that I  esteemed him the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#11)"],[1,"rent--is one of the  special curiosities which distinguish this play; and, as it is wholly  narrative, I shall give it in English prose, abbreviating, here and  there, some details which seem to have but a metrical value:--    \"I was driving my herd of cattle to the summit of the scaur to feed,  what time the sun sent forth his earliest beams to warm the earth.  And lo! three companies of women, and at the head of one of them  Autonoe, thy mother Agave at the head of the second, and Ino at the  head of the third.  And they all slept, with limbs relaxed, leaned  against the low boughs of the pines, or with head thrown heedlessly  among the oak-leaves strewn upon the ground--all in the sleep of  temperance, not, as thou saidst, pursuing Cypris through the  solitudes of the forest, drunken with wine, amid the low rustling of  the lotus-pipe.    \"And thy mother, when she heard the lowing of the kine, stood up in  the midst of them, and cried to them to shake off sleep.  And they,  casting slumber from their eyes, started upright, a marvel of beauty  and order, young and old and maidens yet unmarried.  And first, they  let fall their hair upon their shoulders; and those [72] whose  cinctures were unbound re-composed the spotted fawn-skins, knotting  them about with snakes, which rose and licked them on the chin.  Some, lately mothers, who with breasts still swelling had left their  babes behind, nursed in their arms antelopes, or wild whelps of  wolves, and yielded them their milk to drink; and upon their heads  they placed crowns of ivy or of oak, or of flowering convolvulus.  Then one, taking a thyrsus-wand, struck with it upon a rock, and  thereupon leapt out a fine rain of water; another let down a reed  upon the earth, and a fount of wine was sent forth there; and those  whose thirst was for a white stream, skimming the surface with their  finger-tips, gathered from it abundance of milk; and from the ivy of  the mystic wands streams of honey distilled.  Verily! hadst thou seen  these things, thou wouldst have worshipped whom now thou revilest.    \"And we shepherds and herdsmen came together to question with each  other over this matter--what strange and terrible things they do.  And a certain wayfarer from the city, subtle in speech, spake to us--  'O! dwellers upon these solemn ledges of the hills, will ye that we  hunt down, and take, amid her revelries, Agave, the mother of  Pentheus, according to the king's pleasure?'  And he seemed to us to  speak wisely; and we lay in wait among the bushes; and they, at the  time appointed, began moving their wands for the Bacchic dance, [73]  calling with one voice upon Bromius!--Iacchus!--the son of Zeus! and  the whole mountain was moved with ecstasy together, and the wild  creatures; nothing but was moved in their running.  And it chanced  that Agave, in her leaping, lighted near me, and I sprang from my  hiding-place, willing to lay hold on her; and she groaned out, 'O!  dogs of hunting, these fellows are upon our traces; but follow me!  follow! with the mystic wands for weapons in your hands.'  And we, by  flight, hardly escaped tearing to pieces at their hands, who  thereupon advanced with knifeless fingers upon the young of the kine,  as they nipped the green; and then hadst thou seen one holding a  bleating calf in her hands, with udder distent, straining it asunder;  others tore the heifers to shreds amongst them; tossed up and down  the morsels lay in sight--flank or hoof--or hung from the fir-trees,  dropping churned blood.  The fierce, horned bulls stumbled forward,  their breasts upon the ground, dragged on by myriad hands of young  women, and in a moment the inner parts were rent to morsels.  So,  like a flock of birds aloft in flight, they retreat upon the level  lands outstretched below, which by the waters of Asopus put forth the  fair-flowering crop of Theban people--Hysiae and Erythrae--below the  precipice of Cithaeron.\"--    A grotesque scene follows, in which the [74] humour we noted, on  seeing those two old men diffidently set forth in chaplet and fawn-  skin, deepens into a profound tragic irony.  Pentheus is determined  to go out in arms against the Bacchanals and put them to death, when  a sudden desire seizes him to witness them in their encampment upon  the mountains.  Dionysus, whom he still supposes to be but a prophet  or messenger of the god, engages to conduct him thither; and, for  greater security among the dangerous women, proposes that he shall  disguise himself in female attire.  As Pentheus goes within for that  purpose, he lingers for a moment behind him, and in prophetic speech  declares the approaching end;--the victim has fallen into the net;  and he goes in to assist at the toilet, to array him in the ornaments  which he will carry to Hades, destroyed by his own mother's hands.  It is characteristic of Euripides--part of his fine tact and  subtlety--to relieve and justify what seems tedious, or constrained,  or merely terrible and grotesque, by a suddenly suggested trait of  homely pathos, or a glimpse of natural beauty, or a morsel of form or  colour seemingly taken directly from picture or sculpture.  So here,  in this fantastic scene our thoughts are changed in a moment by  the singing of the chorus, and divert for a while to the dark-haired  tresses of the wood; the breath of the river-side is upon us; beside  it, a fawn escaped from the hunter's net is flying swiftly in [75]  its joy; like it, the Maenad rushes along; and we see the little head  thrown back upon the neck, in deep aspiration, to drink in the dew.    Meantime, Pentheus has assumed his disguise, and comes forth tricked  up with false hair and the dress of a Bacchanal; but still with some  misgivings at the thought of going thus attired through the streets  of Thebes, and with many laughable readjustments of the unwonted  articles of clothing.  And with the woman's dress, his madness is  closing faster round him; just before, in the palace, terrified at  the noise of the earthquake, he had drawn sword upon a mere fantastic  appearance, and pierced only the empty air.  Now he begins to see the  sun double, and Thebes with all its towers repeated, while his  conductor seems to him transformed into a wild beast; and now and  then, we come upon some touches of a curious psychology, so that we  might almost seem to be reading a modern poet.  As if Euripides had  been aware of a not unknown symptom of incipient madness (it is said)  in which the patient, losing the sense of resistance, while lifting  small objects imagines himself to be raising enormous weights,  Pentheus, as he lifts the thyrsus, fancies he could lift Cithaeron  with all the Bacchanals upon it.  At all this the laughter of course  will pass round the theatre; while those who really pierce into the  purpose of the poet, shudder, as they see the victim thus grotesquely  clad going to his doom, [76] already foreseen in the ominous chant of  the chorus--and as it were his grave-clothes, in the dress which  makes him ridiculous.    Presently a messenger arrives to announce that Pentheus is dead, and  then another curious narrative sets forth the manner of his death.  Full of wild, coarse, revolting details, of course not without  pathetic touches, and with the loveliness of the serving Maenads, and  of their mountain solitudes--their trees and water--never quite  forgotten, it describes how, venturing as a spy too near the sacred  circle, Pentheus was fallen upon, like a wild beast, by the mystic  huntresses and torn to pieces, his mother being the first to begin  \"the sacred rites of slaughter.\"    And at last Agave herself comes upon the stage, holding aloft the  head of her son, fixed upon the sharp end of the thyrsus, calling  upon the women of the chorus to welcome the revel of the Evian god;  who, accordingly, admit her into the company, professing themselves  her fellow-revellers, the Bacchanals being thus absorbed into the  chorus for the rest of the play.  For, indeed, all through it, the  true, though partly suppressed relation of the chorus to the  Bacchanals is this, that the women of the chorus, staid and temperate  for the moment, following Dionysus in his alternations, are but the  paler sisters of his more wild and gloomy votaries--the true  followers of the mystical Dionysus--the real chorus of Zagreus; the  idea that their [77] violent proceedings are the result of madness  only, sent on them as a punishment for their original rejection of  the god, being, as I said, when seen from the deeper motives of the  myth, only a \"sophism\" of Euripides--a piece of rationalism of which  he avails himself for the purpose of softening down the tradition of  which he has undertaken to be the poet.  Agave comes on the stage,  then, blood-stained, exulting in her \"victory of tears,\" still quite  visibly mad indeed, and with the outward signs of madness, and as her  mind wanders, musing still on the fancy that the dead head in her  hands is that of a lion she has slain among the mountains--a young  lion, she avers, as she notices the down on the young man's chin, and  his abundant hair--a fancy in which the chorus humour her, willing to  deal gently with the poor distraught creature.  Supported by them,  she rejoices \"exceedingly, exceedingly,\" declaring herself  \"fortunate\" in such goodly spoil; priding herself that the victim has  been slain, not with iron weapons, but with her own white fingers,  she summons all Thebes to come and behold.  She calls for her aged  father to draw near and see; and for Pentheus himself, at last, that  he may mount and rivet her trophy, appropriately decorative there,  between the triglyphs of the cornice below the roof, visible to all.    And now, from this point onwards, Dionysus himself becomes more and  more clearly discernible [78] as the hunter, a wily hunter, and man  the prey he hunts for; \"Our king is a hunter,\" cry the chorus, as  they unite in Agave's "]]]
