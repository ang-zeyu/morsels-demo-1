Conversely, in  the emaciated we sometimes find beneath the skin nucleated cells, which  contain only one oil drop. Many masses of fat which have an important  relation to muscular actions--such as the fat of the orbit or the cheek--  do not disappear in the most emaciated object. Even in starvation, the  fatty substances of the brain and spinal cord are retained.--VALENTIN.] of  this tissue, just beneath the skin (Fig. 24), giving roundness and  plumpness to the body, and acting as an excellent nonconductor for the  retention of heat. It collects as pads in the hollows of the bones, around  the joints, and between the muscles, causing them to glide more easily  upon each other. As marrow, it nourishes the skeleton, and also  distributes the shock of any jar the limb may sustain.    It is noticeable, however, that fat does not gather within the cranium,  the lungs, or the eyelids, where its accumulation would clog the organs.    IV. THE TEETH.    THE TEETH [Footnote: Although the teeth are always found in connection  with the skeleton, and are, therefore, figured as a part of it (Fig. 1),  yet they do not properly belong to the bones of the body, and are merely  set in the solid jaw to insure solidity. They are hard, and resemble bony  matter, yet they are neither true bone nor are they formed in the same  manner. \"They are properly appendages of the mucous membrane, and are  developed from it.\"--LEIDY. \"They belong to the Tegumentary System, which,  speaking generally of animals, includes teeth, nails, horns, scales, and  hairs.\"--MARSHALL. They are therefore classed with the mucous membrane, as  are the nails and hair with the skin.] are thirty-two in all,--there being  eight in each half jaw, similarly shaped and arranged. In each set of  eight, the two nearest the middle of the jaw have wide, sharp, chisel-like  edges, fit for cutting, and hence are called _incisors_. The next one  corresponds to the great tearing or holding tooth of the dog, and is  styled the _canine_, or eye-tooth. The next two have broader crowns,  with two points, or cusps, and are hence termed the _bicuspids_. The  remaining three are much broader, and, as they are used to crush the food,  are called the _grinders_, or _molars_. The incisors and  eyeteeth have one fang, or root; the others have two or three fangs.    THE MILK TEETH.--We are provided with two sets of teeth. The first, or  milk teeth, are small and only twenty in number. In each half jaw there  are two incisors, one canine, and two molars. The middle incisors are  usually cut about the age of seven months, the others at nine months, the  first molars at twelve months, the canines at eighteen months, and the  remaining molars at two or three years of age. The lower teeth precede the  corresponding upper ones. The time often varies, but the order seldom.    THE PERMANENT TEETH.--At six years, when the first set is usually still  perfect, the jaws contain the crowns of all the second, except the wisdom  teeth. About this age, to meet the wants of the growing body, the crowns  of the permanent set begin to press against the roots of the milk teeth,  which, becoming absorbed, leave the loosened teeth to drop out, while the  new ones rise and occupy their places. [Footnote: If the milk teeth, do  not promptly loosen on the appearance of the second set, the former should  be at once removed to permit the permanent teeth to assume their natural  places. If any fail to come in regularly, or if they crowd the others, a  competent dentist should be consulted.]    FIG. 25.    [Illustration: _The teeth at the age of six and one half years._ I,  _the incisors;_ O, _the canine;_ M, _the molars; the last  molar is the first of the permanent teeth;_ F, _sacs of the permanent  incisors;_ C, _of the canine;_ B, _of the bicuspids;_ N,  _of the second molar; the sac of the third molar is empty._--  MARSHALL.]    The central incisors appear at about seven years of age; the others at  eight; the first bicuspids at nine, the second at ten; the canines at  eleven or twelve; the second [Footnote: The first molar appears much  earlier. (See Fig. 25.)] molars at twelve or thirteen, and the last, or  wisdom teeth, are sometimes delayed until the twenty-second year, or even  later.    STRUCTURE OF THE TEETH.--The interior of the tooth consists principally of  _dentine_, a dense substance resembling bone. [Footnote: In the tusk  of the elephant this is known as ivory.] The crown of the tooth, which is  exposed to wear, is protected by a sheath of _enamel_. This is a  hard, glistening, white substance, containing only two and a half per cent  of animal matter. The fang is covered by a thin layer of true bone  (cement).    FIG. 26.    [Illustration: _Vertical section of a Molar Tooth, moderately  magnified._ a, _enamel of the crown, the lines of which indicate the  arrangement of its columns;_ b, _dentine;_ c, _cement;_ d,  _pulp cavity._]    At the center of the tooth is a cavity filled with a soft, reddish-white,  pulpy substance full of blood vessels and nerves. This pulp is very  sensitive, and toothache is caused by its irritation.    THE FITTING OF THE TOOTH INTO THE JAW is a most admirable contrivance. It  is not set like a nail in wood, having the fang in contact with the bone;  but the socket is lined with a membrane which forms a soft cushion. While  this is in a healthy state, it deadens the force of any shock, but, when  inflamed, it becomes the seat of excruciating pain.    THE DECAY OF THE TEETH [Footnote: Unlike the other portions of the body,  there is no provision made for any change in the permanent teeth. That  part, however, which is thus during life most liable to change, after  death resists it the longest. In deep-sea dredgings teeth are found when  all traces of the frame to which they belonged have disappeared. Yet hard  and incorruptible as they seem, their permanence is only relative. Exposed  to injury and disease, they break or decay. Even if they escape accident,  they yet wear at the crown, are absorbed at the fang, and, in time, drop  out, thus affording another of the many signs of the limitations  Providence has fixed to the endurance of our bodies and the length of our  lives.] is commonly caused (1) by portions of the food which become  entangled between them, and, on account of the heat and moisture, quickly  decompose; and (2) by the saliva, as it evaporates, leaving on the teeth a  sediment, which we call tartar. This collects organic matter that rapidly  changes, and also affords a soil in which a sort of fungus speedily  springs up. From both these causes, the breath becomes offensive, and the  teeth are injured.    PRESERVATION OF THE TEETH.--Children should early be taught to brush their  teeth at least every morning with tepid water, and twice a week with white  castile soap and powdered orris root, or with some dentifrice recommended  by a responsible dentist. They should also be instructed to remove the  particles of food from between the teeth, after each meal, by means of a  quill or wooden toothpick.    The enamel once injured is never restored, and the whole interior of the  tooth is exposed to decay. We should not, therefore, crack hard nuts, bite  thread, or use metal toothpicks, gritty tooth powders, or any acid which  \"sets the teeth on edge,\" _i. e._. that acts upon the enamel. It is  well also to have the teeth examined yearly by a dentist, that any small  orifice may be filled, and further decay prevented.    V. THE GLANDS OF THE SKIN.    1. THE OIL GLANDS are clusters of tiny sacs which secrete an oil that  flows along the duct to the root of the hair, and thence oozes out on the  cuticle (Fig. 24). [Footnote: This secretion is said to vary in different  persons, and on that account the dog is enabled to trace his master by the  scent.] This is nature's efficient hair-dressing, and also keeps the skin  soft and flexible. These glands are not usually found where there is no  hair, as on the palm of the hand, and hence at those points only can water  readily soak through the skin into the body. They are of considerable size  on the face, especially about the nose. When obstructed, their contents  become hard and dark-colored, and are vulgarly called \"worms.\" [Footnote:  Though they are not alive, yet, under the microscope, they are sometimes  found to contain a curious parasite, called the pimple mite, which is  supposed to consume the superabundant secretion.]    II. THE PERSPIRATORY GLANDS are fine tubes about 1/300 of an inch in  diameter, and a quarter of an inch in length, which run through the cutis,  and then coil up in little balls (Fig. 24). They are found in all parts of  the body, and in almost incredible numbers. In the palm of the hand, there  are about two thousand eight hundred in a single square inch. On the back  of the neck and trunk, where they are fewest, there are yet four hundred  to the square inch. The total number on the body of an adult is estimated  at about two and a half million. If they were laid end to end, they would  extend nearly ten miles. [Footnote: The current statement, that they would  extend twenty-eight miles, is undoubtedly an exaggeration. Krause  estimates the total number at 2,381,248, and the length of each coil, when  unraveled, at 1/10 of an inch, which would make the total length much less  than even the statement in the text. Seguin states that the proportion of  impurities thrown off by the skin and the lungs, is eleven to seven.] The  mouths of these glands--\"pores,\" as we commonly call them--may be seen  with a pocket lens along the fine ridges which cover the palm of the hand.    THE PERSPIRATION.--From these openings, there constantly passes a vapor,  forming what we call the insensible perspiration.

On his return to Camboja with the governor's answer and  present, Belloso found that the Siamese had seized the country and  had occupied it. Accordingly they captured him, and the Siamese king  seized the present which he carried off with the other captures to his  country. This Diego Belloso, getting wind of the king's intention, had  word sent to the latter that, if he were to send him on this business,  he would go as far as Manila, since he knew that archipelago so well,  and find out what had happened to the junk. At the same time he said  that he would establish friendship and commerce in the king's name  with the Spaniards, and would procure many European curiosities for  him, which were to be found in Manila, especially a colored stone  large enough to serve as a hilt for the two-handed sword which the  king used--a thing which the king greatly desired on account of  a smaller one that he had found among the presents, and which he  carried before him when on his elephant. The king agreed to this and  had a junk prepared; he sent in it a Siamese who was in his service,  and all the other men necessary for the voyage, together with Diego  Belloso. He sent two elephants to the governor of Manila, and a  quantity of benzoin, ivory, and other merchandise for sale, with  the proceeds of which they were to buy the curiosities mentioned by  Belloso. Having set sail they encountered a storm, and the junk put in  at Malaca, where they learned that the other junk of the Siamese king,  for which they were looking, had been seized, and that the Spaniards  who had embarked as prisoners at Camboja, had taken it with all its  cargo to Manila, after killing the Siamese guards.    At this news the Siamese king's servant began to look less favorably  upon the journey to Manila, and accordingly, although against Belloso's  desire, began to discharge and sell the goods in Malaca with the  intention of returning immediately to Sian. One morning this servant  of the Siamese king, Aconsi [51] by name, was found dead in the junk,  although he had retired safe and sound the night before. Thereupon  Diego Belloso became master of the situation, and after again embarking  the goods and elephants on the junk, left Malaca, and journeyed to  Manila. There he found Don Luys Dasmariñas acting as governor, because  of his father Gomez Perez's death. To him he gave the present of the  elephants, which he brought from the king, and told him what else had  been sent. The other goods and merchandise were offered for sale by  another Siamese who represented his king's service in the same junk.    Belloso met Blas Ruys de Hernan Gonçales and his two companions in  Manila. Among them all they agreed to persuade Governor Don Luys to  send a fleet to Camboja to aid King Langara who was living in exile and  stripped of his kingdom. They alleged that it would be easy to restore  the king to power, and that at the same time the Spaniards might  gain a foothold on the mainland, where they could settle and fortify  themselves, whence would follow other important and more considerable  results. They called on the religious of the Order of St. Dominic to  support them before the governor in this plan. These easily put the  matter on such good footing--for the governor followed their advice  in everything that it was decided to prepare a fleet with as many  men as possible, under command of the captain and sargento-mayor,  Juan Xuarez Gallinato, himself in a ship of moderate size. He was  to be accompanied by two junks: one under command of Diego Belloso,  and the other under that of Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonçalez, with one  hundred and twenty Spaniards, some Japanese and native Indians,  and all else that was necessary.    This resolution seemed inexpedient to the majority of people in the  city, both because it took so many men away, and also, because the  success of the expedition seemed very doubtful. Admitting reports  that the country of Camboja was in the hands of the king of Sian,  who held it with sufficient forces--and nothing else was known--the  result of the expedition would be to make the king of Sian--from whom  the governor had just received presents and a friendly embassy in the  person of Belloso--their declared enemy. And without sending the king  an answer they were about to take up arms against him in favor of one  who was unknown to them, and from whom the Spaniards had received  neither pledges nor obligations. Lieutenant-general Don Antonio  de Morga and Master-of-camp Diego Ronquillo, together with other  captains and influential persons, spoke of this matter to Don Luys,  and even requested him in writing to desist from this expedition. But  although he had no reasons on his side to satisfy them, he was so  taken by the expedition, that, inasmuch as the said religious of  St. Dominic upheld him, he would not change his plans. Accordingly  he despatched the fleet to the kingdom of Camboja at the beginning  of the year ninety-six, which is generally one week's voyage. On the  other hand, he dismissed the Siamese who had accompanied Belloso,  without any definite answer to the embassy of the king of Siam,  to whom he sent in return for his presents, some products of the  country, which he thought appropriate. The Siamese, seeing that they  were being sent back to their country, were satisfied, and expected  no other result of their coming.    A storm overtook the fleet, and the flagship which carried Juan  Xuarez Gallinato and the majority of the Spaniards, took refuge  in the strait of Sincapura near Malaca, where it remained for many  days. The other two junks which carried Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz  with some Spaniards, Japanese, and natives of Manila, reached Camboja  with great difficulty, and Blas Ruyz, preceding Belloso, went up the  river Mecon as far as the city of Chordemuco. There they learned  that the mandarins of Camboja had united against the Siamese whom  they had conquered and driven from the kingdom; and that one of these  mandarins, Anacaparan by name, had taken possession of the country,  and was governing under the title of king, although against the will of  the others. Diego Belloso, Blas Ruyz, and those with them thought that  they had arrived in good season for the furtherance of their designs,  since confusion reigned among the Cambodians, and the Siamese were  out of the country. Expecting Gallinato and the flagship to arrive  directly, they spent several days in Chordemuco with the permission  of Anacaparan, who resided nine leguas away in Sistor. Although the  latter knew of the entry of these ships and their men, and that many  more were coming, whose intentions he knew; and although he thought  that it would not be favorable to him: yet he dissembled with them,  waiting to see what time would bring. At the same time six Chinese  ships with their merchandise arrived in Chordemuco and, while they  were discharging it, the Chinese being many and hating the Spaniards,  behaved towards them with great arrogance and insolence. This obliged  the Spaniards, for the sake of their reputation, and in order to  avenge themselves for injuries received, to take up arms against  the Chinese. This they did, killing many Chinese and seizing their  ships and all their cargo. Anacaparan took offense at this, and was  desirous for the Chinese to avenge themselves by his aid. To remedy  this evil Fray Alonso Ximenez, [52] of the Dominican order, who  accompanied the Spaniards, thought that he, together with Blas Ruys  and Diego Belloso, and about fifty Spaniards, a few Japanese, and men  from Luzon, should leave the rest to guard the ships in Chordemuco,  and should go up in small boats to Sistor, in order to obtain an  interview with Anacaparan and offer him excuses and satisfaction  for the trouble that they had had with the Chinese. And in order to  negotiate with him more easily, they made a letter of embassy in the  name of the governor of Manila, because Gallinato carried with him  the one given them by the governor. This device was of little service  to them, because Anacaparan not only did not grant them audience,  but after having seized their boats, kept them so hard pressed in a  lodging outside the city, and so threatened that he would kill them,  if they did not return the ships and what they had taken from them  to the Chinese, that the Spaniards were quite anxious to return to  Chordemuco and board their vessels for greater security. They decided  to do so as best they could.    Their necessity, and beholding themselves in this danger, encouraged  them, one night, although at great risk, to leave their lodgings, and  find a passage where they could cross the river to the city side. They  crossed the river, arms in hand, late at night, and as silently as  possible. Finding themselves near the city, and their courage and  determination increasing, they entered the city and went as far  as the king's house. They set fire to it, to the magazines, and to  other buildings on their way, and threw the Cambodians into so great  confusion, that that night and the following morning they killed many  people, among them King Anacaparan himself. After this they thought it  unwise to advance or maintain their ground, and accordingly marched  back to their ships as orderly as possible. Meanwhile a great number  of Cambodians, with arms and several elephants, started to pursue the  Spaniards and overtook them before the latter reached their ships. The  Spaniards defended themselves valiantly, and continued their march  until embarking without the loss of a single man, while the Cambodians  returned to the city with some of their men killed and wounded.    Diego Belloso and Bias Ruiz had hardly boarded their ships, when"]]]
