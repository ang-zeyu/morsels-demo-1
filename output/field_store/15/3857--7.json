There  were two of us and hundreds needing help. What could we do? We gathered  on to some of the most helpless with our riatas tied to the carts, and  helped as many as we could into camp on Avenue hill.    This was a bitter, cold night and we had no fuel except very small sage  brush. Several died that night.    Next morning, Brother Young having come up, we three started for our  camp near Devil's Gate. All were rejoiced to get the news that we  had found the emigrants. The following morning most of the company  moved down, meeting the hand-cart company at Greasewood creek. Such  assistance as we could give was rendered to all until they finally  arrived at Devil's Gate fort about the 1st of November. There were some  twelve hundred in all, about one-half with hand-carts and the other  half with teams.        CHAPTER XIII.    Short Rations--Wagons Unloaded of Their Freight and Loaded With  Emigrants--Myself and Company Left to Guard the goods--One Sister's  Discouragement.    The winter storms had now set in, in all their severity. The provisions  we took amounted to almost nothing among so many people, many of them  now on very short rations, some almost starving. Many were dying daily  from exposure and want of food. We were at a loss to know why others  had not come on to our assistance.    The company was composed of average emigrants: old, middle-aged and  young; women and children. The men seemed to be failing and dying  faster than the women and children.    The hand-cart company was moved over to a cove in the mountains for  shelter and fuel; a distance of two miles from the fort. The wagons  were banked near the fort. It became impossible to travel further  without reconstruction or help. We did all we possibly could to help  and cheer the people. Some writers have endeavored to make individual  heroes of some of our company. I have no remembrance of any one  shirking his duty. Each and everyone did all they possibly could and  justice would give to each his due credit.    All the people who could, crowded into the houses of the fort out of  the cold and storm. One crowd cut away the walls of the house they were  in for fuel, until half of the roof fell in; fortunately they were all  on the protected side and no one was hurt.    Many suggestions were offered as to what should be done, some efforts  being made to cache the imperishable goods and go on with the rest.  Accordingly pits were dug, boxes opened and the hardware, etc., put in  one, while clothing, etc., were put in another.    Often these boxes belonged to different persons. An attempt was made by  Brother Cantwell, to keep an account of these changes.    This caching soon proved to be a failure for the pits would fill up  with drifting snow as fast as the dirt was thrown out, so no caches  were made. The goods were never replaced.    Each evening the Elders would meet in council. I remember hearing  Charles Decker remark that he had crossed the plains over fifty times  (carrying the mail) and this was the darkest hour he had ever seen.  Cattle and horses were dying every day. What to do was all that could  be talked about. Five or six days had passed and nothing determined  upon.    Steve Taylor, Al. Huntington and I were together when the question,  \"Why doesn't Captain Grant leave all the goods here with some one to  watch them, and move on?\" was asked. We agreed to make this proposal  to him. It was near the time appointed for the meeting. As soon as we  were together, Capt. Grant asked if anyone had thought of a plan. We  presented ours. Capt. Grant replied, \"I have thought of this, but there  are no provisions to leave and it would be asking too much of anyone  to stay here and starve for the sake of these goods; besides, where  is there a man who would stay if called upon.\" I answered, \"Any of us  would.\" I had no idea I would be selected, as it was acknowledged I was  the best cook in camp and Capt. Grant had often spoken as though he  could not spare me.    That a proper understanding may be had, I will say that these goods  were the luggage of a season's emigration that these two wagon trains  had contracted to freight, and it was being taken through as well as  the luggage of the people present. Leading these goods meant to abandon  all that many poor families had upon earth. So it was different from  common merchandise.    There was a move made at once to adopt this suggestion. Accordingly,  next morning store rooms in the fort were cleared and some two hundred  wagons run in and unloaded. No one was allowed to keep out anything but  a change of clothing, some bedding and light cooking utensils. Hauling  provisions was not a weighty question.    This unloading occupied three days. The handcart people were notified  to abandon most of their carts. Teams were hitched up and the sick and  feeble loaded in with such light weight as was allowed. All became  common property.    When everything was ready Brother Burton said to me, \"Now Brother Jones  we want you to pick two men from the valley to stay with you. We have  notified Captains Hunt and Horgett to detail seventeen men from their  companies to stay with you. We will move on in the morning. Get your  company together and such provisions as you can find in the hands of  those who may have anything to spare. You know ours is about out. Will  you do it?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"Well take your choice from our company. You  are acquainted with the boys and whoever you want will stay.\" I had a  great mind to tell him I wanted Captains Grant and Burton.    There was not money enough on earth to have hired me to stay. I had  left home for only a few days and was not prepared to remain so long  away; but I remembered my assertion that any of us would stay if called  upon. I could not back out, so I selected Thomas Alexander and Ben  Hampton. I am satisfied that two more faithful men to stand under all  hardships could not have been found.    That night we were called together and organized as a branch. Dan W.  Jones, Thomas Alexander and Ben Hampton were chosen to preside, with J.  Laty as clerk. The rest of the company was composed of the following  names: John Cooper, John Hardcastle, John Shorton, John Chapel, John  Galbraith, John Ellis, John Whitaker, William Handy, William Laty,  Edwin Summers, Rossiter Jenkins, Elisha Manning, Henry Jakeman George  Watt, George Watts and ------ -----    Captain Grant asked about our provisions. I told him they were scant,  but as many were suffering and some dying, all we asked was an equal  chance with the rest. He told us there would be a lot of worn out  cattle left; to gather them up and try to save them.    They consisted mostly of yearlings and two-year-old heifers, some one  was taking through.    The storm had now ceased to rage and great hopes  were felt for a successful move. We were daily expecting more help and  often wondered why it did not come. Next day all hands pulled out, most  of them on foot.    After getting my camp regulated a little and giving some instructions,  I got on my horse and rode on to see how the train was moving along.  All were out of sight when I started. After traveling a few miles,  I came upon a lady sitting alone on the side of the road, weeping  bitterly. I noticed she was elegantly dressed and appeared strong and  well. I asked her what was the matter. She sobbingly replied, \"This  is too much for me. I have always had plenty, and have never known  hardships; we had a good team and wagon; my husband, if let alone,  could have taken me on in comfort. Now I am turned out to walk in this  wind and snow. I am determined not to go on but will stay here and die.  My husband has gone on and left me, but I will not go another step.\"  The train was two or three miles ahead and moving on. I persuaded her  after a while to go on with me.    This lady, Mrs. Linforth, and her husband now live in San Francisco,  California. They could not stand the hardships of Zion; but I believe  they are friendly to our people.    After overtaking the train and seeing them on the move. Captain Grant  asked me to go back with instructions for the brethren left with me;  then to come on next day and camp with them over night.    On calling the company together at the fort that night, I told them  in plain words that if there was a man in camp who could not help eat  the last poor animal left with us, hides and all, suffer all manner of  privations, almost starve to death, that he could go on with me the  next day and overtake the trains. No one wanted to go. All voted to  take their chances.    On taking stock of provisions, we found about twenty day's rations. No  salt or bread excepting a few crackers. There was at least five months  of winter before us and nothing much to eat but a few perishing cattle  and what game we might chance to kill. The game was not very certain,  as the severe storms had driven everything away. The first move was to  fix up the fort. Accordingly Brother Alexander, being a practical man,  was appointed to manage the business; Brother Hampton was to see about  the cattle.    I followed the train this day to their second encampment and the next  day traveled with them. There was much suffering, deaths occurring  often. Eph Hanks arrived in camp from the valley and brought word that  some of the teams that had reached South Pass and should have met us  here, had turned back towards home and tried to persuade Redick Allred,  who was left there with a load of flour, to go back with them. The men  who did this might have felt justified; they said it was no use going  farther, that we had doubtless all perished. I will not mention their  names for it was always looked upon by the company as cowardly in the  extreme.    If this had not occurred it was the intention of Captain Grant to have  sent some one down "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4657"],[0,"Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah & Meccah — Volume 1 (#11)"],[1," from caste; the excommunication of our feudal times was not a more  dreadful form of living death.  [FN#10] With us every man's house is his castle. But caste divides a  people into huge families, each member of which has a right to know  everything about his \"caste-brother,\" because a whole body might be  polluted and degraded by the act of an individual. Hence, there is no  such thing as domestic privacy, and no system of espionnage devised by  rulers could be so complete as that self-imposed by the Hindus.  [FN#11] The Calcutta Review (No. 41), noticing \"L'Inde sous la  Domination Anglaise,\" by the Baron Barchou de Penhoën, delivers the  following sentiment: \"Whoever states, as the Baron B. de P. states and  repeats, again and again, that the natives generally entertain a bad  opinion of the Europeans generally, states what is decidedly untrue.\"  The reader will observe that I differ as decidedly from the Reviewer's  opinion. Popular feeling towards the English in India was \"at first one  of fear, afterwards of horror: Hindus and Hindis (Moslems) considered  the strangers a set of cow-eaters and fire-drinkers, tetrae beluae ac  molossis suis ferociores, who would fight like Iblis, cheat their own  fathers, and exchange with the same readiness a broadside of shots and  thrusts of boarding-pikes, or a bale of goods and a bag of rupees.\"  (Rev. Mr. Anderson-The English in Western India.) We have risen in a  degree above such a low standard of estimation; still, incredible as it  may appear to the Frank himself, it is no less true, that the Frank  everywhere in the East is considered a contemptible being, and  dangerous withal. As regards Indian opinion concerning our government,  my belief is, that in and immediately about the three presidencies,  where the people owe everything to and hold everything by our rule, it  is most popular. At the same time I am convinced that in other places  the people would most willingly hail any change. And how can we hope it  to be otherwise,-we, a nation of strangers, aliens to the country's  customs and creed, who, even while resident in India, act the part  which absentees do in other lands? Where, in the history of the world,  do we read that such foreign dominion ever made itself loved?  [FN#12] This was written three years before the Indian Mutiny. I also  sent into the Court of Directors a much stronger report-for which I  duly suffered.  [FN#13] In the Arabic \"Muruwwat,\" generosity, the noble part of human  nature, the qualities which make a man.  [FN#14] \"For medicine,\" means for an especial purpose, an urgent  occasion.  [FN#15] \"Allah Karim!\" said to a beggar when you do not intend to be  bountiful.  [FN#16] Read an account of Tipu Sahib's treatment of his French  employes. If Rangit Singh behaved better to his European officers, it  was only on account of his paramount fear and hatred of the British.  The Panjabi story of the old lion's death is amusing enough, contrasted  with that Anglomania of which so much has been said and written. When  the Sikh king, they declare, heard of our success in Afghanistan-he had  allowed us a passage through his dominions, as ingress into a deadly  trap-his spirits (metaphorically and literally) failed him; he had not  the heart to drink, he sickened and he died.  [FN#17] The Rajputs, for instance, \"whose land has ever been the focus  of Indian chivalry, and the home of Indian heroes.\"  [FN#18] As my support against the possible, or rather the probable,  imputation of \"extreme opinions,\" I hold up the honoured name of the  late Sir Henry Elliot (Preface to the Biographical Index to the  Historians of Mohammedan India). \"These idle vapourers (bombastic  Babus, and other such political ranters), should learn that the sacred  spark of patriotism is exotic here, and can never fall on a mine that  can explode; for history will show them that certain peculiarities of  physical, as well as moral organisation, neither to be strengthened by  diet nor improved by education, have hitherto prevented their ever  attempting a national independence; which will continue to exist to  them but as a name, and as an offscouring of college declamations.\"    [p.41]CHAPTER IV.    LIFE IN THE WAKALAH.    THE \"Wakalah,\" as the Caravanserai or Khan is called in Egypt, combines  the offices of hotel, lodging-house, and store. It is at Cairo, as at  Constantinople, a massive pile of buildings surrounding a quadrangular  \"Hosh\" or court-yard. On the ground-floor are rooms like caverns for  merchandise, and shops of different kinds-tailors, cobblers, bakers,  tobacconists, fruiterers, and others. A roofless gallery or a covered  verandah, into which all the apartments open, runs round the first and  sometimes the second story: the latter, however, is usually exposed to  the sun and wind. The accommodations consist of sets of two or three  rooms, generally an inner one and an outer; the latter contains a  hearth for cooking, a bathing-place, and similar necessaries. The  staircases are high, narrow, and exceedingly dirty; dark at night, and  often in bad repair; a goat or donkey is tethered upon the different  landings; here and there a fresh skin is stretched in process of  tanning, and the smell reminds the veteran traveller of those closets  in the old French    [p.42]inns where cat used to be prepared for playing the part of jugged  hare. The interior is unfurnished; even the pegs upon which clothes are  hung have been pulled down for fire-wood: the walls are bare but for  stains, thick cobwebs depend in festoons from the blackened rafters of  the ceiling, and the stone floor would disgrace a civilised prison: the  windows are huge apertures carefully barred with wood or iron, and in  rare places show remains of glass or paper pasted over the framework.  In the court-yard the poorer sort of travellers consort with tethered  beasts of burden, beggars howl, and slaves lie basking and scratching  themselves upon mountainous heaps of cotton bales and other merchandise.    This is not a tempting picture, yet is the Wakalah a most amusing  place, presenting a succession of scenes which would delight lovers of  the Dutch school-a rich exemplification of the grotesque, and what is  called by artists the \"dirty picturesque.\"    I could find no room in the Wakalah Khan Khalil, the Long's, or  Meurice's of native Cairo; I was therefore obliged to put up with the  Jamaliyah, a Greek quarter, swarming with drunken Christians, and  therefore about as fashionable as Oxford Street or Covent Garden. Even  for this I had to wait a week. The pilgrims were flocking to Cairo, and  to none other would the prudent hotel keepers open their doors, for the  following sufficient reasons. When you enter a Wakalah, the first thing  you have to do is to pay a small sum, varying from two to five  shillings, for the Miftah (the key). This is generally equivalent to a  month's rent; so the sooner you leave the house the better for it. I  was obliged to call myself a Turkish pilgrim in order to get possession  of two most comfortless rooms, which I afterwards learned were  celebrated for making travellers ill; and I had to pay eighteen  piastres for the key and eighteen ditto per mensem for    [p.43]rent, besides five piastres to the man who swept and washed the  place. So that for this month my house-hire amounted to nearly four  pence a day.    But I was fortunate enough in choosing the Jamaliyah Wakalah, for I  found a friend there. On board the steamer a fellow-voyager, seeing me  sitting alone and therefore as he conceived in discomfort, placed  himself by my side and opened a hot fire of kind inquiries. He was a  man about forty-five, of middle size, with a large round head closely  shaven, a bull-neck, limbs sturdy as a Saxon's, a thin red beard, and  handsome features beaming with benevolence. A curious dry humour he  had, delighting in \"quizzing,\" but in so quiet, solemn, and quaint a  way that before you knew him you could scarcely divine his drift.    \"Thank Allah, we carry a doctor!\" said my friend more than once, with  apparent fervour of gratitude, after he had discovered my profession. I  was fairly taken in by the pious ejaculation, and some days elapsed  before the drift of his remark became apparent.    \"You doctors,\" he explained, when we were more intimate, \"what do you  do? A man goes to you for ophthalmia: it is a purge, a blister, and a  drop in the eye! Is it for fever? well! a purge and kinakina (quinine).  For dysentery? a purge and extract of opium. Wa'llahi! I am as good a  physician as the best of you,\" he would add with a broad grin, \"if I  only knew the Dirham-birhams,[FN#1]-drams and drachms,-and a few  break-jaw Arabic names of diseases.\"    Haji Wali[FN#2] therefore emphatically advised me to    [p.44]make bread by honestly teaching languages. \"We are  doctor-ridden,\" said he, and I found it was the case.    When we lived under the same roof, the Haji and I became fast friends.  During the day we called on each other frequently, we dined together,  and passed the evening in a Mosque, or some other place of public  pastime. Coyly at first, but less guardedly as we grew bolder, we  smoked the forbidden weed \"Hashish,[FN#3]\" conversing lengthily the  while about that world of which I had seen so much. Originally from  Russia, he also had been a traveller, and in his wanderings he had cast  off most of the prejudices of his people. \"I believe in Allah and his  Prophet, and in nothing else,\" was his sturdy creed; he rejected  alchemy, jinnis and magicians, and truly he had a most unoriental  distaste for tales of wonder. When I entered the Wakalah, he  constituted himself my cicerone, and especially guarded me against the  cheating of trades-men. By his advice I laid aside the Darwaysh's gown,  the large blue pantaloons, and the short shirt; in fact all connection  with Persia and the Persians. \"If you persist in being an 'Ajami,\" said  the Haji, \"you will"]]]
