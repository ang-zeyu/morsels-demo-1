There  seems, however, no good reason to suppose that such was the case, for it  is extremely improbable that such perfect and important feathers as  those of the wings and tail should alone have been developed, while  there are many reasons why the feathers of the body might have been lost  before the bird was covered by mud, or why their impressions do not  show.    It was a considerable time after the finding of the first specimen that  the presence of teeth in the jaws was discovered, partly because the  British Museum specimen was imperfect,[6] and partly because no one  suspected that birds had ever possessed teeth, and so no one ever looked  for them. When, in 1877, a more complete example was found, the  existence of teeth was unmistakably shown; but in the meantime, in  February, 1873, Professor Marsh had announced the presence of teeth in  Hesperornis, and so to him belongs the credit of being the discoverer of  birds with teeth.    [6] _The skull was lacking, and a part of the upper jaw lying to one  side was thought to belong to a fish._    The next birds that we know are from our own country, and although  separated by an interval of thousands of years from the Jurassic  Archaeopteryx, time enough for the members of one group to have quite  lost their wings, they still retain teeth, and in this respect the most  bird-like of them is quite unlike any modern bird. These come from the  chalk beds of western Kansas, and the first specimens were obtained by  Professor Marsh in his expeditions of 1870 and 1871, but not until a few  years later, after the material had been cleaned and was being studied,  was it ascertained that these birds were armed with teeth. The smaller  of these birds, which was apparently not unlike a small gull in general  appearance, was, saving its teeth, so thoroughly a bird that it may be  passed by without further notice, but the larger was remarkable in many  ways. Hesperornis, the western bird, was a great diver, in some ways the  greatest of the divers, for it stood higher than the king penguin,  though more slender and graceful in general build, looking somewhat like  an overgrown, absolutely wingless loon.    The penguins, as everyone knows, swim with their front limbs--we can't  call them wings--which, though containing all the bones of a wing, have  become transformed into powerful paddles; Hesperornis, on the other  hand, swam altogether with its legs--swam so well with them, indeed,  that through disuse the wings dwindled away and vanished, save one bone.  This, however, is not stating the theory quite correctly; of course the  matter cannot be actually proved. Hesperornis was a large bird, upwards  of five feet in length, and if its ancestors were equally bulky their  wings were quite too large to be used in swimming under water, as are  those of such short-winged forms as the Auks which fly under the water  quite as much as they fly over it. Hence the wings were closely folded  upon the body so as to offer the least possible resistance, and being  disused, they and their muscles dwindled, while the bones and muscles  of the legs increased by constant use. By the time the wings were small  enough to be used in so dense a medium as water the muscles had become  too feeble to move them, and so degeneration proceeded until but one  bone remained, a mere vestige of the wing that had been. The penguins  retain their great breast muscles, and so did the Great Auk, because  their wings are used in swimming, since it requires even more strength  to move a small wing in water than it does to move a large wing in the  thinner air. As for our domesticated fowls--the turkeys, chickens, and  ducks--there has not been sufficient lapse of time for their muscles to  dwindle, and besides artificial selection, the breeding of fowls for  food has kept up the mere size of the muscles, although these lack the  strength to be found in those of wild birds.    As a swimming bird, one that swims with its legs and not with its wings,  Hesperornis has probably never been equalled, for the size and  appearance of the bones indicate great power, while the bones of the  foot were so joined to those of the leg as to turn edgewise as the foot  was brought forward and thus to offer the least possible resistance to  the water. It is a remarkable fact that the leg bones of Hesperornis are  hollow, remarkable because as a rule the bones of aquatic animals are  more or less solid, their weight being supported by the water; but those  of the great diver were almost as light as if it had dwelt upon the dry  land. That it did not dwell there is conclusively shown by its build,  and above all by its feet, for the foot of a running bird is modified in  quite another way.    The bird was probably covered with smooth, soft feathers, something like  those of an Apteryx; this we know because Professor Williston found a  specimen showing the impression of the skin of the lower part of the leg  as well as of the feathers that covered the \"thigh\" and head. While such  a covering seems rather inadequate for a bird of such exclusively  aquatic habits as Hesperornis must have been, there seems no getting  away from the facts in the case in the shape of Professor Williston's  specimen, and we have in the Snake Bird, one of the most aquatic of  recent birds, an instance of similarly poor covering. As all know who  have seen this bird at home, its feathers shed the water very  imperfectly, and after long-continued submersion become saturated, a  fact which partly accounts for the habit the bird has of hanging itself  out to dry.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Hesperornis, the Great Toothed Diver. _From a  drawing by J. M. Gleeson._]    The restoration which Mr. Gleeson has drawn differs radically from any  yet made, and is the result of a careful study of the specimen belonging  to the United States National Museum. No one can appreciate the  peculiarities of Hesperornis and its remarkable departures from other  swimming birds who has not seen the skeleton mounted in a swimming  attitude. The great length of the legs, their position at the middle of  the body, the narrowness of the body back of the hip joint, and the  disproportionate length of the outer toe are all brought out in a manner  which a picture of the bird squatting upon its haunches fails utterly to  show. As for the tail, it is evident from the size and breadth of the  bones that something of the kind was present; it is also evident that it  was not like that of an ordinary bird, and so it has been drawn with  just a suggestion of Archaeopteryx about it.    The most extraordinary thing about Hesperornis, however, is the position  of the legs relative to the body, and this is something that was not  even suspected until the skeleton was mounted in a swimming attitude. As  anyone knows who has watched a duck swim, the usual place for the feet  and legs is beneath and in a line with the body. But in our great  extinct diver the articulations of the leg bones are such that this is  impossible, and the feet and lower joint of the legs (called the tarsus)  must have stood out nearly at right angles to the body, like a pair of  oars. This is so peculiar and anomalous an attitude for a bird's legs  that, although apparently indicated by the shape of the bones, it was at  first thought to be due to the crushing and consequent distortion to  which the bones had been subjected, and an endeavor was made to place  the legs in the ordinary position, even though this was done at the  expense of some little dislocation of the joints. But when the mounting  of the skeleton had advanced further it became more evident that  Hesperornis was not an ordinary bird, and that he could not have swum in  the usual manner, since this would have brought his great knee-caps up  into his body, which would have been uncomfortable. And so, at the cost  of some little time and trouble,[7] the mountings were so changed that  the legs stood out at the sides of the body, as shown in the picture.    [7] _The mounting of fossil bones is quite a different matter from the  wiring of an ordinary skeleton, since the bones are not only so hard  that they cannot be bored and wired like those of a recent animal, but  they are so brittle and heavy that often they will not sustain their own  weight. Hence such bones must be supported from the outside, and to do  this so that the mountings will be strong enough to support their  weight, allow the bones to be removed for study, and yet be  inconspicuous, is a difficult task._    A final word remains to be said about toothed birds, which is, that the  visitor who looks upon one for the first time will probably be  disappointed. The teeth are so loosely implanted in the jaw that most of  them fall out shortly after death, while the few that remain are so  small as not to attract observation.    By the time the Eocene Period was reached, even before that, birds had  become pretty much what we now see them, and very little change has  taken place in them since that time; they seem to have become so exactly  adapted to the conditions of existence that no further modification has  taken place. This may be expressed in another way, by saying that while  the Mammals of the Eocene have no near relatives among those now living,  entire large groups having passed completely out of existence, the few  birds that we know might, so far as their appearance and affinities go,  have been killed yesterday.    Were we to judge of the former abundance of birds by the number we find  in a fossil state, we should conclude that in the early days of the  world they were remarkably scarce, for bird bones are among the rarest  of fossils. But from the high degree of development evidenced by the few  examples that have come to light, and the fact that these represent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#11)"],[1,"that he would defend himself before the judge, that  he would prove his innocence; and he had not had time to do so. He  reproached himself bitterly for having trusted to the judge's benevolent  face.    \"What a farce,\" he angrily exclaimed, \"to call that an examination!\"    It was not really an examination, but a mere formality.    In summoning Prosper, M. Patrigent obeyed Article 93 of the Criminal  Code, which says, \"Every suspected person under arrest must be examined  within twenty-four hours.\"    But it is not in twenty-four hours, especially in a case like this, with  no evidence or material proof, that a judge can collect the materials  for an examination.    To triumph over the obstinate defence of a prisoner who shuts himself up  in absolute denial as if in a fortress, valid proofs are needed. These  weapons M. Patrigent was busily preparing. If Prosper had remained a  little longer in the gallery, he would have seen the same bailiff who  had called him come out to the judge's office, and cry out:    \"Number three.\"    The witness, who was awaiting his turn, and answered the call for number  three, was M. Fauvel.    The banker was no longer the same man. Yesterday he was kind and affable  in his manner: now, as he entered the judge's room, he seemed irritated.  Reflection, which usually brings calmness and a desire to pardon,  brought him anger and a thirst for vengeance.    The inevitable questions which commence every examination had scarcely  been addressed to him before his impetuous temper gained the mastery,  and he burst forth in invectives against Prosper.    M. Patrigent was obliged to impose silence upon him, reminding him of  what was due to himself, no matter what wrongs he had suffered at the  hands of his clerk.    Although he had very slightly examined Prosper, the judge was now  scrupulously attentive and particular in having every question answered.  Prosper's examination had been a mere formality, the stating and proving  a fact. Now it related to collecting the attendant circumstances and  the most trifling particulars, so as to group them together, and reach a  just conclusion.    \"Let us proceed in order,\" said the judge, \"and pray confine yourself  to answering my questions. Did you ever suspect your cashier of being  dishonest?\"    \"Certainly not. Yet there were reasons which should have made me  hesitate to trust him with my funds.\"    \"What reasons?\"    \"M. Bertomy played cards. I have known of his spending whole nights at  the gaming table, and losing immense sums of money. He was intimate with  an unprincipled set. Once he was mixed up with one of my clients, M. de  Clameran, in a scandalous gambling affair which took place at the house  of some disreputable woman, and wound up by being tried before the  police court.\"    For some minutes the banker continued to revile Prosper.    \"You must confess, monsieur,\" interrupted the judge, \"that you were very  imprudent, if not culpable, to have intrusted your safe to such a man.\"    \"Ah, monsieur, Prosper was not always thus. Until the past year he was  a model of goodness. He lived in my house as one of my family; he spent  all of his evenings with us, and was the bosom friend of my eldest son  Lucien. One day, he suddenly left us, and never came to the house again.  Yet I had every reason to believe him attached to my niece Madeleine.\"    M. Patrigent had a peculiar manner of contracting his brows when he  thought he had discovered some new proof. He now did this, and said:    \"Might not this admiration for the young lady have been the cause of M.  Bertomy's estrangement?\"    \"How so?\" said the banker with surprise. \"I was willing to bestow  Madeleine upon him, and, to be frank, was astonished that he did not ask  for her hand. My niece would be a good match for any man, and he should  have considered himself fortunate to obtain her. She is beautiful, and  her dowry will be half a million.\"    \"Then you can see no motive for your cashier's conduct?\"    \"It is impossible for me to account for it. I have, however, always  supposed that Prosper was led astray by a young man whom he met at my  house about this time, M. Raoul de Lagors.\"    \"Ah! and who is this young man?\"    \"A relative of my wife; a very attractive, intelligent young man,  somewhat wild, but rich enough to pay for his follies.\"    The judge wrote the name Lagors at the bottom of an already long list on  his memorandum.    \"Now,\" he said, \"we are coming to the point. You are sure that the theft  was not committed by anyone in your house?\"    \"Quite sure, monsieur.\"    \"You always kept your key?\"    \"I generally carried it about on my person; and, whenever I left it at  home, I put it in the secretary drawer in my chamber.\"    \"Where was it the evening of the robbery?\"    \"In my secretary.\"    \"But then--\"    \"Excuse me for interrupting you,\" said M. Fauvel, \"and to permit me to  tell you that, to a safe like mine, the key is of no importance. In the  first place, one is obliged to know the word upon which the five movable  buttons turn. With the word one can open it without the key; but without  the word--\"    \"And you never told this word to anyone?\"    \"To no one, monsieur, and sometimes I would have been puzzled to know  myself with what word the safe had been closed. Prosper would change it  when he chose, and, if he had not informed me of the change, would have  to come and open it for me.\"    \"Had you forgotten it on the day of the theft?\"    \"No: the word had been changed the day before; and its peculiarity  struck me.\"    \"What was it?\"    \"Gypsy, g, y, p, s, y,\" said the banker, spelling the name.    M. Patrigent wrote down this name.    \"One more question, monsieur: were you at home the evening before the  robbery?\"    \"No; I dined and spent the evening with a friend; when I returned home,  about one o'clock, my wife had retired, and I went to bed immediately.\"    \"And you were ignorant of the amount of money in the safe?\"    \"Absolutely. In conformity with my positive orders, I could only suppose  that a small sum had been left there over-night; I stated this fact to  the commissary in M. Bertomy's presence, and he acknowledged it to be  the case.\"    \"Perfectly correct, monsieur: the commissary's report proves it.\" M.  Patrigent was for a time silent. To him everything depended upon this  one fact, that the banker was unaware of the three hundred and fifty  thousand francs being in the safe, and Prosper had disobeyed orders  by placing them there over-night; hence the conclusion was very easily  drawn.    Seeing that his examination was over, the banker thought that he would  relieve his mind of what was weighing upon it.    \"I believe myself above suspicion, monsieur,\" he began, \"and yet I can  never rest easy until Bertomy's guilt has been clearly proved. Calumny  prefers attacking a successful man: I may be calumniated: three hundred  and fifty thousand francs is a fortune capable of tempting even a  rich man. I would be obliged if you would have the condition of my  banking-house examined. This examination will prove that I could have  no interest in robbing my own safe. The prosperous condition of my  affairs--\"    \"That is sufficient, monsieur.\"    M. Patrigent was well informed of the high standing of the banker, and  knew almost as much of his affairs as did M. Fauvel himself.    He asked him to sign his testimony, and then escorted him to the door of  his office, a rare favor on his part.    When M. Fauvel had left the room, Sigault indulged in a remark.    \"This seems to be a very cloudy case,\" he said; \"if the cashier is  shrewd and firm, it will be difficult to convict him.\"    \"Perhaps it will,\" said the judge, \"but let us hear the other witnesses  before deciding.\"    The person who answered to the call for number four was Lucien, M.  Fauvel's eldest son.    He was a tall, handsome young man of twenty-two. To the judge's  questions he replied that he was very fond of Prosper, was once very  intimate with him, and had always regarded him as a strictly honorable  man, incapable of doing anything unbecoming a gentleman.    He declared that he could not imagine what fatal circumstances could  have induced Prosper to commit a theft. He knew he played cards, but not  to the extent that was reported. He had never known him to indulge in  expenses beyond his means.    In regard to his cousin Madeleine, he replied:    \"I always thought that Prosper was in love with Madeleine, and, until  yesterday, I was certain he would marry her, knowing that my father  would not oppose their marriage. I have always attributed the  discontinuance of Prosper's visits to a quarrel with my cousin, but  supposed they would end by becoming reconciled.\"    This information, more than that of M. Fauvel, threw light upon  Prosper's past life, but did not apparently reveal any evidence which  could be used in the present state of affairs.    Lucien signed his deposition, and withdrew.    Cavaillon's turn for examination came next. The poor fellow was in a  pitiable state of mind when he appeared before the judge.    Having, as a great secret, confided to a friend his adventure with the  detective, and being jeered at for his cowardice in giving up the note,  he felt great remorse, and passed the night in reproaching himself for  having ruined Prosper.    He endeavored to repair, as well as he could, what he called his  treason.    He did not exactly accuse M. Fauvel, but he courageously declared that  he was the cashier's friend, and that he was as sure of his innocence as  he was of his own.    Unfortunately, besides his having no proofs to strengthen his  assertions, these were deprived of any value by his violent professions  of friendship for the accused.    After Cavaillon, six or eight clerks of the Fauvel bank successively  defiled in the judge's office; but their depositions were nearly all  insignificant.    One of them, however, stated a fact which the judge "]]]
