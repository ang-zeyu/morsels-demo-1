[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#11)"],[1,"the morning of the day  before my whole life had twisted out of its accustomed orbit. I had  spent four hundred dollars of my savings; I had sold about thirteen  dollars' worth of books; I had precipitated a fight and met a  philosopher. Not only that, I was dimly beginning to evolve a new  philosophy of my own. And all this in order to prevent Andrew from  buying a lot more books! At any rate, I had been successful in  that. When he had seen Parnassus at last, he had hardly looked at  her--except in tones of scorn. I caught myself wondering whether the  Professor would allude to the incident in his book, and hoping that  he would send me a copy. But after all, why should he mention it? To  him it was only one of a thousand adventures. As he had said angrily  to Andrew, he was nothing to me, nor I to him. How could he realize  that this was the first adventure I had had in the fifteen years I  had been--what was it he called it?--compiling my anthology. Well,  the funny little gingersnap!    I kept Bock tied to the back of the van, as I was afraid he might  take a notion to go in search of his master. As we jogged on, and  the falling sun cast a level light across the way, I got a bit  lonely. This solitary vagabonding business was a bit sudden after  fifteen years of home life. The road lay close to the water and I  watched the Sound grow a deeper blue and then a dull purple. I could  hear the surf pounding, and on the end of Long Island a far-away  lighthouse showed a ruby spark. I thought of the little gingersnap  roaring toward New York on the express, and wondered whether he was  travelling in a Pullman or a day coach. A Pullman chair would feel  easy after that hard Parnassus seat.    By and by we neared a farmhouse which I took to be Mr. Pratt's. It  stood close to the road, with a big, red barn behind and a gilt  weathervane representing a galloping horse. Curiously enough Peg  seemed to recognize the place, for she turned in at the gate and  neighed vigorously. It must have been a favourite stopping place for  the Professor.    Through a lighted window I could see people sitting around a table.  Evidently the Pratts were at supper. I drew up in the yard. Some one  looked out of a window, and I heard a girl's voice:    \"Why, Pa, here's Parnassus!\"    Gingersnap must have been a welcome visitor at that farm, for in an  instant the whole family turned out with a great scraping of chairs  and clatter of dishes. A tall, sunburnt man, in a clean shirt with  no collar, led the group, and then came a stout woman about my own  build, and a hired man and three children.    \"Good evening!\" I said. \"Is this Mr. Pratt?\"    \"Sure thing!\" said he. \"Where's the Perfessor?\"    \"On his way to Brooklyn,\" said I. \"And I've got Parnassus. He told  me to be sure to call on you. So here we are.\"    \"Well, I want to know!\" ejaculated Mrs. Pratt. \"Think of Parnassus  turned suffrage! Ben, you put up the critters, and I'll take Mrs.  Mifflin in to supper.\"    \"Hold on there,\" I said. \"My name's McGill--Miss McGill. See,  it's painted on the wagon. I bought the outfit from Mr. Mifflin.  A business proposition entirely.\"    \"Well, well,\" said Mr. Pratt. \"We're glad to see any friend of the  Perfessor. Sorry he's not here, too. Come right in and have a bite  with us.\"    They were certainly good-hearted folk, Mr. and Mrs. Ben Pratt. He  put Peg and Bock away in the barn and gave them their supper, while  Mrs. Pratt took me up to her spare bedroom and brought me a jug of  hot water. Then they all trooped back into the dining-room and the  meal began again. I am a connoisseur of farm cooking, I guess, and  I've got to hand it to Beulah Pratt that she was an A-1 housewife.  Her hot biscuit was perfect; the coffee was real Mocha, simmered,  not boiled; the cold sausage and potato salad was as good as any  Andrew ever got. And she had a smoking-hot omelet sent in for me,  and opened a pot of her own strawberry preserve. The children (two  boys and a girl) sat open-mouthed, nudging one another, and Mr.  Pratt got out his pipe while I finished up on stewed pears and cream  and chocolate cake. It was a regular meal. I wondered what Andrew  was eating and whether he had found the nest behind the wood pile  where the red hen always drops her eggs.    \"Well, well,\" said Mr. Pratt, \"tell us about the Perfessor. We was  expectin' him here some time this fall. He generally gets here  around cider time.\"    \"I guess there isn't so much to tell,\" I said. \"He stopped up at our  place the other day, and said he wanted to sell his outfit. So I  bought him out. He was pining to get back to Brooklyn and write a  book.\"    \"That book o' his!\" said Mrs. Pratt. \"He was always talkin' on it,  but I don't believe he ever started it yet.\"    \"Whereabout do you come from, Miss McGill?\" said Pratt. I could see  he was mighty puzzled at a woman driving a vanload of books around  the country, alone.    \"Over toward Redfield,\" I said.    \"You any kin to that writer that lives up that way?\"    \"You mean Andrew McGill?\" I said. \"He's my brother.\"    \"Do tell!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pratt. \"Why the Perfessor thought a  terrible lot of him. He read us all to sleep with one of his books  one night. Said he was the best literature in this State, I do  believe.\"    I smiled to myself as I thought of the set-to on the road from  Shelby.    \"Well,\" said Pratt, \"if the Perfessor's got any better friends  than us in these parts, I'm glad to meet 'em. He come here first  time 'bout four years ago. I was up working in the hayfield that  afternoon, and I heard a shout down by the mill pond. I looked over  that way and saw a couple o' kids waving their arms and screamin'.  I ran down the hill and there was the Perfessor just a pullin' my  boy Dick out o' the water. Dick's this one over here.\"    Dick, a small boy of thirteen or so, grew red under his freckles.    \"The kids had been foolin' around on a raft there, an' first thing  you know Dick fell in, right into deep water, over by the dam.  Couldn't swim a stroke, neither. And the Perfessor, who jest  happened to be comin' along in that 'bus of his, heard the boys  yell. Didn't he hop out o' the wagon as spry as a chimpanzee, skin  over the fence, an' jump into the pond, swim out there an' tow the  boy in! Yes, ma'am, he saved that boy's life then an' no mistake.  That man can read me to sleep with poetry any night he has a mind  to. He's a plumb fine little firecracker, the Perfessor.\"    Farmer Pratt pulled hard on his pipe. Evidently his friendship for  the wandering bookseller was one of the realities of his life.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" he went on, \"that Perfessor has been a good friend to  me, sure enough. We brought him an' the boy back to the house. The  boy had gone down three times an' the Perfessor had to dive to find  him. They were both purty well all in, an' I tell you I was scared.  But we got Dick around somehow--rolled him on a sugar bar'l, an'  poured whiskey in him, an' worked his arms, an' put him in hot  blankets. By and by he come to. An' then I found that the Perfessor,  gettin' over the barb-wire fence so quick (when he lit for the pond)  had torn a hole in his leg you could put four fingers in. There was  his trouser all stiff with blood, an' he not sayin' a thing.  Pluckiest little runt in three States, by Judas! Well, we put _him_  to bed, too, and then the Missus keeled over, an' we put _her_ to  bed. Three of them, by time the Doc got here. Great old summer  afternoon that was! But bless your heart, we couldn't keep the  Perfessor abed long. Next day he was out lookin' fer his poetry  books, an' first thing you know he had us all rounded up an' was  preachin' good literature at us like any evangelist. I guess we all  fell asleep over his poetry, so then he started on readin' that  'Treasure Island' story to us, wasn't it, Mother? By hickory, we  none of us fell asleep over that. He started the kids readin' so  they been at it ever since, and Dick's top boy at school now.  Teacher says she never saw such a boy for readin'. That's what  Perfessor done for us! Well, tell us 'bout yerself, Miss McGill. Is  there any good books we ought to read? I used to pine for some o'  that feller Shakespeare my father used to talk about so much, but  Perfessor always 'lowed it was over my head!\"    It gave me quite a thrill to hear all this about Mifflin. I  could readily imagine the masterful little man captivating the  simple-hearted Pratts with his eloquence and earnestness. And the  story of the mill pond had its meaning, too. Little Redbeard was no  mere wandering crank--he was a real man, cool and steady of brain,  with the earmarks of a hero. I felt a sudden gush of warmth as I  recalled his comical ways.    Mrs. Pratt lit a fire in her Franklin stove and I racked my head  wondering how I could tread worthily in the Professor's footsteps.  Finally I fetched the \"Jungle Book\" from Parnassus and read them  the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. There was a long pause when I had  finished.    \"Say, Pa,\" said Dick shyly, \"that mongoose was rather like  Professor, wasn't he!\"    Plainly the Professor was the traditional hero of this family,  and I began to feel rather like an impostor!    I suppose it was foolish of me, but I had already made up my mind  to push on to Woodbridge that night. It could not be more than four  miles, and the time was not much after eight. I felt a little twinge  of quite unworthy annoyance because I was still treading in the  glamour of the Professor's influence. The Pratts would talk of  nothing else, and I wanted to get somewhere where I would be  estimated at my own value, not merely as his disciple. \"Darn the  Redbeard,\" I said to myself, \"I think he has bewitched these  people!\" And in spite of their protests and invitations to stay the  night, I insisted on having Peg hitched up. I gave them the copy  of the \"Jungle Book\" as a small return for their hospitality,  and finally sold Mr. Pratt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#11)"],[1,"es, are really closely related, these forms can be  spoken of as one side of art--the SUBJECTIVE. Every artist  chooses, from the forms which reflect his own time, those which  are sympathetic to him, and expresses himself through them. So  the subjective element is the definite and external expression of  the inner, objective element.    The inevitable desire for outward expression of the OBJECTIVE  element is the impulse here defined as the \"inner need.\" The  forms it borrows change from day to day, and, as it continually  advances, what is today a phrase of inner harmony becomes  tomorrow one of outer harmony. It is clear, therefore, that the  inner spirit of art only uses the outer form of any particular  period as a stepping-stone to further expression.    In short, the working of the inner need and the development of  art is an ever-advancing expression of the eternal and objective  in the terms of the periodic and subjective.    Because the objective is forever exchanging the subjective  expression of today for that of tomorrow, each new extension of  liberty in the use of outer form is hailed as the last and  supreme. At present we say that an artist can use any form he  wishes, so long as he remains in touch with nature. But this  limitation, like all its predecessors, is only temporary. From  the point of view of the inner need, no limitation must be made.  The artist may use any form which his expression demands; for his  inner impulse must find suitable outward expression.    So we see that a deliberate search for personality and \"style\" is  not only impossible, but comparatively unimportant. The close  relationship of art throughout the ages, is not a relationship in  outward form but in inner meaning. And therefore the talk of  schools, of lines of \"development,\" of \"principles of art,\" etc.,  is based on misunderstanding and can only lead to confusion.    The artist must be blind to distinctions between \"recognized\" or  \"unrecognized\" conventions of form, deaf to the transitory  teaching and demands of his particular age. He must watch only  the trend of the inner need, and hearken to its words alone. Then  he will with safety employ means both sanctioned and forbidden by  his contemporaries. All means are sacred which are called for by  the inner need. All means are sinful which obscure that inner  need.    It is impossible to theorize about this ideal of art. In real art  theory does not precede practice, but follows her. Everything is,  at first, a matter of feeling. Any theoretical scheme will be  lacking in the essential of creation--the inner desire for  expression--which cannot be determined. Neither the quality of  the inner need, nor its subjective form, can be measured nor  weighed.    [Footnote: The many-sided genius of Leonardo devised a system of  little spoons with which different colours were to be used, thus  creating a kind of mechanical harmony. One of his pupils, after  trying in vain to use this system, in despair asked one of his  colleagues how the master himself used the invention. The  colleague replied: \"The master never uses it at all.\"  (Mereschowski, LEONARDO DA VINCI).]    Such a grammar of painting can only be temporarily guessed at,  and should it ever be achieved, it will be not so much according  to physical rules (which have so often been tried and which today  the Cubists are trying) as according to the rules of the inner  need, which are of the soul.    The inner need is the basic alike of small and great problems in  painting. We are seeking today for the road which is to lead us  away from the outer to the inner basis.    [Footnote: The term \"outer,\" here used, must not be confused with  the term \"material\" used previously. I am using the former to  mean \"outer need,\" which never goes beyond conventional limits,  nor produces other than conventional beauty. The \"inner need\"  knows no such limits, and often produces results conventionally  considered \"ugly.\" But \"ugly\" itself is a conventional term, and  only means \"spiritually unsympathetic,\" being applied to some  expression of an inner need, either outgrown or not yet attained.  But everything which adequately expresses the inner need is  beautiful.]    The spirit, like the body, can be strengthened and developed by  frequent exercise. Just as the body, if neglected, grows weaker  and finally impotent, so the spirit perishes if untended. And for  this reason it is necessary for the artist to know the starting  point for the exercise of his spirit.    The starting point is the study of colour and its effects on men.    There is no need to engage in the finer shades of complicated  colour, but rather at first to consider only the direct use of  simple colours.    To begin with, let us test the working on ourselves of individual  colours, and so make a simple chart, which will facilitate the  consideration of the whole question.    Two great divisions of colour occur to the mind at the outset:  into warm and cold, and into light and dark. To each colour there  are therefore four shades of appeal--warm and light or warm and  dark, or cold and light or cold and dark.    Generally speaking, warmth or cold in a colour means an approach  respectively to yellow or to blue. This distinction is, so to  speak, on one basis, the colour having a constant fundamental  appeal, but assuming either a more material or more non-material  quality. The movement is an horizontal one, the warm colours  approaching the spectator, the cold ones retreating from him.    The colours, which cause in another colour this horizontal  movement, while they are themselves affected by it, have another  movement of their own, which acts with a violent separative  force. This is, therefore, the first antithesis in the inner  appeal, and the inclination of the colour to yellow or to blue,  is of tremendous importance.    The second antithesis is between white and black; i.e., the  inclination to light or dark caused by the pair of colours just  mentioned. These colours have once more their peculiar movement  to and from the spectator, but in a more rigid form (see Fig. 1).        FIGURE I         First Pair of antitheses.           (inner appeal acting on           A and B.                           the spirit)      A.       Warm               Cold          Yellow              Blue      = First antithesis    Two movements:            (i) horizontal    Towards the spectator <-----<<< >>>-----> Away from the spectator       (bodily)                                  (spiritual)                            Yellow      Blue          (ii)          Ex-         and        concentric      B.  Light                      Dark      White                      Black       = Second Antithesis      Two movements:         (i) discordant    Eternal discord, but with                Absolute discord, devoid   possibilities for the    White   Black  of possibilities for the      future (birth)                         future (death)        (ii) ex-and concentric, as in case of yellow and blue, but           more rigid.        Yellow and blue have another movement which affects the first  antithesis--an ex-and concentric movement. If two circles are  drawn and painted respectively yellow and blue, brief  concentration will reveal in the yellow a spreading movement out  from the centre, and a noticeable approach to the spectator. The  blue, on the other hand, moves in upon itself, like a snail  retreating into its shell, and draws away from the spectator.  [Footnote: These statements have no scientific basis, but are  founded purely on spiritual experience.]    In the case of light and dark colours the movement is emphasized.  That of the yellow increases with an admixture of white, i.e., as  it becomes lighter. That of the blue increases with an admixture  of black, i.e., as it becomes darker. This means that there can  never be a dark-coloured yellow. The relationship between white  and yellow is as close as between black and blue, for blue can be  so dark as to border on black. Besides this physical  relationship, is also a spiritual one (between yellow and white  on one side, between blue and black on the other) which marks a  strong separation between the two pairs.    An attempt to make yellow colder produces a green tint and checks  both the horizontal and excentric movement. The colour becomes  sickly and unreal. The blue by its contrary movement acts as a  brake on the yellow, and is hindered in its own movement, till  the two together become stationary, and the result is green.  Similarly a mixture of black and white produces gray, which is  motionless and spiritually very similar to green.    But while green, yellow, and blue are potentially active, though  temporarily paralysed, in gray there is no possibility of  movement, because gray consists of two colours that have no  active force, for they stand the, one in motionless discord, the  other in a motionless negation, even of discord, like an endless  wall or a bottomless pit.    Because the component colours of green are active and have a  movement of their own, it is possible, on the basis of this  movement, to reckon their spiritual appeal.    The first movement of yellow, that of approach to the spectator  (which can be increased by an intensification of the yellow), and  also the second movement, that of over-spreading the boundaries,  have a material parallel in the human energy which assails every  obstacle blindly, and bursts forth aimlessly in every direction.    Yellow, if steadily gazed at in any geometrical form, has a  disturbing influence, and reveals in the colour an insistent,  aggressive character. [Footnote: It is worth noting that the  sour-tasting lemon and shrill-singing canary are both yellow.]  The intensification of the yellow increases the painful  shrillness of its note.    [Footnote: Any parallel between colour and music can only be  relative. Just as a violin can give various"]]]
