All his life  He has had some weanling truth to guard, has fought  Desperately to defend it, taking cover  Wherever he could, behind old fallen trees  Of superstition, or ruins of old thought.  He has read horoscopes to keep his work  Among the stars in favour with his prince,  I tell you this that you may understand  What seems inconstant in him. It may be  That he was wrong in these things, and must pay  A dreadful penalty. But you must explore  His mind's great ranges, plains and lonely peaks  Before you know him, as I know him now.  How could he talk to children, but in words  That children understand? Have not some said  That God Himself has made His glory dark  For men to bear it. In his human sphere  My father has done this.                           War was the dream  That filmed those old men's eyes. They did not hear  My father, when he hinted at his hope  Of opening up the heavens for mankind  With that new power of bringing far things near.  My heart burned as I heard him; but they blinked  Like owls at noonday. Then I saw him turn,  Desperately, to humour them, from thoughts  Of heaven to thoughts of warfare.                                    Late that night  My own dear lord and father came to me  And whispered, with a glory in his face  As one who has looked on things too beautiful  To breathe aloud, \"Come out, Celeste, and see  A miracle.\"              I followed him. He showed me,  Looking along his outstretched hand, a star,  A point of light above our olive-trees.  It was the star called Jupiter. And then  He bade me look again, but through his glass.  I feared to look at first, lest I should see  Some wonder never meant for mortal eyes.  He too, had felt the same, not fear, but awe,  As if his hand were laid upon the veil  Between this world and heaven.                                 Then . . . I, too, saw,  Small as the smallest bead of mist that clings  To a spider's thread at dawn, the floating disk  Of what had been a star, a planet now,  And near it, with no disk that eyes could see,  Four needle-points of light, unseen before.  \"The moons of Jupiter,\" he whispered low,  \"I have watched them as they moved, from night to night;  A system like our own, although the world  Their fourfold lights and shadows make so strange  Must--as I think--be mightier than we dreamed,  A Titan planet. Earth begins to fade  And dwindle; yes, the heavens are opening now.  Perhaps up there, this night, some lonely soul  Gazes at earth, watches our dawning moon,  And wonders, as we wonder.\"                              In that dark  We knelt together . . .                          Very strange to see  The vanity and fickleness of princes.  Before his enemies had provoked the wrath  Of Rome against him, he had given the name  Of Medicean stars to those four moons  In honour of Prince Cosmo. This aroused  The court of France to seek a lasting place  Upon the map of heaven. A letter came  Beseeching him to find another star  Even more brilliant, and to call it _Henri_  After the reigning and most brilliant prince  Of France. They did not wish the family name  Of Bourbon. This would dissipate the glory.  No, they preferred his proper name of Henri.  We read it together in the garden here,  Weeping with laughter, never dreaming then  That this, this, this, could stir the little hearts  Of men to envy.                  O, but afterwards,  The blindness of the men who thought themselves  His enemies. The men who never knew him,  The men that had set up a thing of straw  And called it by his name, and wished to burn  Their image and himself in one wild fire.  Men? Were they men or children? They refused  Even to look through Galileo's glass,  Lest seeing might persuade them. Even that sage,  That great Aristotelian, Julius Libri,  Holding his breath there, like a fractious child  Until his cheeks grew purple, and the veins  Were bursting on his brow, swore he would die  Sooner than look.                    And that poor monstrous babe  Not long thereafter, kept his word and died,  Died of his own pent rage, as I have heard.  Whereat my lord and father shook his head  And, smiling, somewhat sadly--oh, you know  That smile of his, more deadly to the false  Than even his reasoning--murmured, _\"Libri, dead,  Who called the moons of Jupiter absurd!  He swore he would not look at them from earth,  I hope he saw them on his way to heaven.\"_  Welser in Augsburg, Clavius at Rome,  Scoffed at the fabled moons of Jupiter,  It was a trick, they said. He had made a glass  To fool the world with false appearances.  Perhaps the lens was flawed. Perhaps his wits  Were wandering. Anything rather than the truth  Which might disturb the mighty in their seat.  \"Let Galileo hold his own opinions.  I, Clavius, will hold mine.\"                               He wrote to Kepler;  \"You, Kepler, are the first, whose open mind  And lofty genius could accept for truth  The things which I have seen. With you for friend,  The abuse of the multitude will not trouble me.  Jupiter stands in heaven and will stand,  Though all the sycophants bark at him.                                         In Pisa,  Florence, Bologna, Venice, Padua,  Many have seen the moons. These witnesses  Are silent and uncertain. Do you wonder?  Most of them could not, even when they saw them,  Distinguish Mars from Jupiter. Shall we side  With Heraclitus or Democritus?  I think, my Kepler, we will only laugh  At this immeasurable stupidity.  Picture the leaders of our college here.  A thousand times I have offered them the proof  Of their own eyes. They sleep here, like gorged snakes,  Refusing even to look at planets, moons,  Or telescope. They think philosophy  Is all in books, and that the truth is found  Neither in nature, nor the Universe,  But in comparing texts. How you would laugh  Had you but heard our first philosopher  Before the Grand Duke, trying to tear down  And argue the new planets out of heaven,  Now by his own weird logic and closed eyes  And now by magic spells.\"                            How could he help  Despising them a little? It's an error  Even for a giant to despise a midge;  For, when the giant reels beneath some stroke  Of fate, the buzzing clouds will swoop upon him,  Cluster and feed upon his bleeding wounds,  And do what midges can to sting him blind.  These human midges have not missed their chance.  They have missed no smallest spot upon that sun.  My mother was not married--they have found--  To my dear father. All his children, then,  And doubtless all their thoughts are evil, too;  But who that judged him ever sought to know  Whether, as evil sometimes wears the cloak  Of virtue, nobler virtue in this man  Might wear that outward semblance of a sin?  Yes, even you who love me, may believe  These thoughts are born of my own tainted heart;  And yet I write them, kneeling in my cell  And whisper them to One who blesses me  Here, from His Cross, upon the bare grey wall.  So, if you love me, bless me also, you,  By helping him. Make plain to all you meet  What part his enemies have played in this.  How some one, somehow, altered the command  Laid on him all those years ago, by Rome,  So that it reads to-day as if he vowed  Never to think or breathe that this round earth  Moves with its sister-planets round the sun.  'Tis true he promised not to write or speak  As if this truth were 'stablished equally  With God's eternal laws; and so he wrote  His Dialogues, reasoning for it, and against,  And gave the last word to Simplicio,  Saying that human reason must bow down  Before the power of God.                           And even this  His enemies have twisted to a sneer  Against the Pope, and cunningly declared  Simplicio to be Urban.                         Why, my friend,  There were three dolphins on the titlepage,  Each with the tail of another in its mouth.  The censor had not seen this, and they swore  It held some hidden meaning. Then they found  The same three dolphins sprawled on all the books  Landini printed at his Florence press.  They tried another charge.                             I am not afraid  Of any truth that they can bring against him;  But, O, my friend, I more than fear their lies.  I do not fear the justice of our God;  But I do fear the vanity of men;  Even of Urban; not His Holiness,  But Urban, the weak man, who may resent,  And in resentment rush half-way to meet  This cunning lie with credence. Vanity!  O, half the wrongs on earth arise from that!  Greed, and war's pomp, all envy, and most hate,  Are born of that; while one dear humble heart,  Beating with love for man, between two thieves,  Proves more than all His wounds and miracles  Our Crucified to be the Son of God.  Say that I long to see him; that my prayers  Knock at the gates of mercy, night and day.  Urge him to leave the judgment now with God  And strive no more.                      If he be right, the stars  Fight for him in their courses. Let him bow  His poor, dishonoured, glorious, old grey head  Before this storm, and then come home to me.  O, quickly, or I fear 'twill be too late;  For I am dying. Do not tell him this;  But I must live to hold his hands again,  And know that he is safe.  I dare not leave him, helpless and half blind,  Half father and half child, to rack and cord.  By all the Christ within you, save him, you;  And, though you may have ceased to love me now,  One faithful shadow in your own last hour  Shall watch beside you till all shadows die,  And heaven unfold to bless you where I failed.          II      (_Scheiner writes to Castelli, after the Trial._)    What think you of your Galileo now,  Your hero that like Ajax should defy  The lightning? Yesterday I saw him stand  Trembling before our court of Cardinals,  Trembling before the colour of their robes  As sheep, before the slaughter, at the sight  And smell of blood.

Their life is serene and blissful, in the enjoyment  of legality, equality, liberty, and all other good things.    _Her_. Well, Lycinus? Must not all men yearn to belong to a State like  that, and never count the toil of getting there, nor lose heart over the  time it takes? Enough that one day they will arrive, and be naturalized,  and given the franchise.    _Ly_. In good truth, Hermotimus, we should devote all our efforts to  this, and neglect everything else; we need pay little heed to any claims  of our earthly country; we should steel our hearts against the clingings  and cryings of children or parents, if we have them; it is well if we can  induce them to go with us; but, if they will not or cannot, shake them  off and march straight for the city of bliss, leaving your coat in their  hands, if they lay hold of it to keep you back, in your hurry to get  there; what matter for a coat? You will be admitted there without one.    I remember hearing a description of it all once before from an old man,  who urged me to go there with him. He would show me the way, enroll me  when I got there, introduce me to his own circles, and promise me a share  in the universal Happiness. But I was stiff-necked, in my youthful folly  (it was some fifteen years ago); else might I have been in the outskirts,  nay, haply at the very gates, by now. Among the noteworthy things he told  me, I seem to remember these: all the citizens are aliens and foreigners,  not a native among them; they include numbers of barbarians, slaves,  cripples, dwarfs, and poor; in fact any one is admitted; for their law  does not associate the franchise with income, with shape, size, or  beauty, with old or brilliant ancestry; these things are not considered  at all; any one who would be a citizen needs only understanding, zeal for  the right, energy, perseverance, fortitude and resolution in facing all  the trials of the road; whoever proves his possession of these by  persisting till he reaches the city is _ipso facto_ a full citizen,  regardless of his antecedents. Such distinctions as superior and  inferior, noble and common, bond and free, simply do not exist there,  even in name.    _Her_. There, now; you see I am not wasting my pains on trifles; I  yearn to be counted among the citizens of that fair and happy State.    _Ly_. Why, your yearning is mine too; there is nothing I would sooner pray  for. If the city had been near at hand and plain for all to see, be  assured I would never have doubted, nor needed prompting; I would have  gone thither and had my franchise long ago; but as you tell me--you and  your bard Hesiod--that it is set exceeding far off, one must find out  the way to it, and the best guide. You agree?    _Her_. Of course that is the only thing to do.    _Ly_. Now, so far as promises and professions go, there is no lack of  guides; there are numbers of them waiting about, all representing  themselves as from there. But instead of one single road there seem to be  many different and inconsistent ones. North and South, East and West,  they go; one leads through meadows and vegetation and shade, and is well  watered and pleasant, with never a stumbling-block or inequality; another  is rough and rocky, threatening heat and drought and toil. Yet all these  are supposed to lead to the one city, though they take such different  directions.    That is where my difficulty lies; whichever of them I try, there is sure  to be a most respectable person stationed just at the entrance, with a  welcoming hand and an exhortation to go his way; each of them says he is  the only one who knows the straight road; his rivals are all mistaken,  have never been themselves, nor learnt the way from competent guides. I  go to his neighbour, and he gives the same assurances about _his_ way,  abusing the other respectable persons; and so the next, and the next, and  the next. This multiplicity and dissimilarity of the roads gives me  searchings of heart, and still more the assertiveness and self-  satisfaction of the guides; I really cannot tell which turning or whose  directions are most likely to bring me to the city.    _Her_. Oh, but I can solve that puzzle for you; you cannot go wrong,  if you trust those who have been already.    _Ly_. Which do you mean? those who have been by which road, and under  whose guidance? It is the old puzzle in a new form; you have only  substituted men for measures.    _Her_. How do you mean?    _Ly_. Why, the man who has taken Plato's road and travelled with him will  recommend that road; so with Epicurus and the rest; and _you_ will  recommend your own. How else, Hermotimus? it must be so.    _Her_. Well, of course.    _Ly_. So you have not solved my puzzle; I know just as little as before  which traveller to trust; I find that each of them, as well as his guide,  has tried one only, which he now recommends and will have to be the only  one leading to the city. Whether he tells the truth I have no means of  knowing; that he has attained _some_ end, and seen _some_ city, I may  perhaps allow; but whether he saw the right one, or whether, Corinth being  the real goal, he got to Babylon and thought he had seen Corinth--that is  still undecided; for surely every one who has seen a city has not seen  Corinth, unless Corinth is the only city there is. But my greatest  difficulty of all is the absolute certainty that the true road is one; for  Corinth is one, and the other roads lead anywhere but to Corinth, though  there may be people deluded enough to suppose that the North road and the  South road lead equally to Corinth.    _Her_. But that is absurd, Lycinus; they go opposite ways, you see.    _Ly_. Then, my dear good man, this choice of roads and guides is quite a  serious matter; we can by no means just follow our noses; we shall be  discovering that we are well on the way to Babylon or Bactria instead of  to Corinth. Nor is it advisable to toss up, either, on the chance that we  may hit upon the right way if we start upon any one at a venture. That is  no impossibility; it may have come off once and again in a cycle; but I  cannot think we ought to gamble recklessly with such high stakes, nor  commit our hopes to a frail craft, like the wise men who went to sea in a  bowl; we should have no fair complaint against Fortune, if her arrow or  dart did not precisely hit the centre; the odds are ten thousand to one  against her; just so the archer in Homer--Teucer, I suppose it was--when  he meant to hit the dove, only cut the string, which held it; of course it  is infinitely more likely that the point of the arrow will find its billet  in one of the numberless other places, than just in that particular  central one. And as to the perils of blundering into one of the wrong  roads instead of the right one, misled by a belief in the discretion of  Fortune, here is an illustration:--it is no easy matter to turn back and  get safe into port when you have once cast loose your moorings and  committed yourself to the breeze; you are at the mercy of the sea,  frightened, sick and sorry with your tossing about, most likely. Your  mistake was at the beginning: before leaving, you should have gone up to  some high point, and observed whether the wind was in the right quarter,  and of the right strength for a crossing to Corinth, not neglecting, by  the way, to secure the very best pilot obtainable, and a seaworthy craft  equal to so high a sea.    _Her_. Much better so, Lycinus. However, I know that, if you go the  whole round, you will find no better guides or more expert pilots than  the Stoics; if you mean ever to get to Corinth, you will follow them, in  the tracks of Chrysippus and Zeno. It is the only way to do it.    _Ly_. Ah, many can play at the game of assertion. Plato's fellow  traveller, Epicurus's follower, and all the rest, will tell me just what  you do, that I shall never get to Corinth except with whichever of them  it is. So I must either believe them all, or disbelieve impartially. The  latter is much the safest, until we have found out the truth.    Put a case, now: just as I am, as uncertain as ever which of the whole  number has the truth, I choose your school; I rely on you, who are my  friend, but who still know only the Stoic doctrine, and have not  travelled any way but that. Now some God brings Plato, Pythagoras,  Aristotle, and the rest to life again; they gather round and cross-  examine me, or actually sue me in court for constructive defamation;  _Good Lycinus_, they say, _what possessed or who induced you to  exalt Chrysippus and Zeno at our expense? we are far older established;  they are mere creatures of yesterday; yet you never gave us a hearing,  nor inquired into our statements at all_. Well, what am I to plead?  will it avail me to say I trusted my friend Hermotimus? I feel sure they  will say, _We know not this Hermotimus, who he is, nor he us; you had  no right to condemn us all, and give judgement by default against us, on  the authority of a man who knew only one of the philosophic roads, and  even that, perhaps, imperfectly. These are not the instructions issued to  juries, Lycinus; they are not to hear one party, and, refuse the other  permission to say what he deems advisable; they are to hear both sides  alike, with a view to the better sifting of truth from falsehood by  comparison of the arguments; if they fail in these duties, the law allows  an appeal to another court_. That is what we may expect them to say.    Then one of them might proceed to question me like this: _Suppose,  Lycinus, that an Ethiopian who had never been abroad in his life, nor  seen other men like us, were to state categorically in an Ethiopian  assembly that there did not exist on earth any white or yellow men--  nothing but blacks--, would his statement be accepted? or would some  Ethiopian elder remark, How do you know, my confident friend? you have  never been in"]]]
