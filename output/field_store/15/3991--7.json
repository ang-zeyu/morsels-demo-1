Thirdly, wide  variability is the most efficient means of acclimatization, and only  species with many elementary units would have offered the adequate  material for introduction into new countries.    From this discussion it would seem that it is more reasonable to assert  that variability is one of the causes of the success of cultivation,  than to assume that cultivation is a cause of variability [67] at large.  And this assumption would be equally sufficient to explain the existing  conditions among cultivated plants.    Of course I do not pretend to say that cultivated plants should be  expected to be less variable than in the wild state, or that swarms of  elementary species might not be produced during cultivation quite as  well as before. However the chance of such an event, as is easily seen,  cannot be very great, and we shall have to be content with a few  examples of which the coconut is a notable one.    Leaving this general discussion of the subject, we may take up the  example of the beets. The sugar-beet is only one type from among a horde  of others, and though the origin of all the single types is not  historically known, the plant is frequently found in the wild state even  at the present time, and the native types may be compared with the  corresponding cultivated varieties.    The cultivation of beets for sugar is not of very ancient date. The  Romans knew the beets and used them as vegetables, both the roots and  the leaves. They distinguished a variety with white and one with red  flesh, but whether they cultivated them, or only collected them from  where they grew spontaneously, appears to be unknown.    [68] Beets are even now found in large quantities along the shores of  Italy. They prefer the vicinity of the sea, as do so many other members  of the beet family, and are not limited to Italy, but are found growing  elsewhere on the littoral of the Mediterranean, in the Canary Islands  and through Persia and Babylonia to India. In most of their native  localities they occur in great abundance.    The color of the foliage and the size of the roots are extremely  variable. Some have red leafstalks and veins, others a uniform red or  green foliage, some have red or white or yellow roots, or exhibit  alternating rings of a red and of a white tinge on cut surfaces. It  seems only natural to consider the white and the red, and even the  variegated types as distinct varieties, which in nature do not  transgress their limits nor change into one another. In a subsequent  lecture I will show that this at least is the rule with the  corresponding color-varieties in other genera.    The fleshiness or pulpiness of the roots is still more variable. Some  are as thick as the arm and edible, others are not thicker than a finger  and of a woody composition, and the structure of this woody variety is  very interesting. The sugar-beet consists, as is generally known, of  concentric layers of sugar-tissue and of vascular [69] strands; the  larger the first and the smaller the latter, the greater is, as a rule,  the average amount of sugar of the race. Through the kindness of the  late Mr. Rimpau, a well known German breeder of sugar-beet varieties, I  obtained specimens from seed of a native wild locality near Bukharest.  The plants produced quite woody roots, showing almost no sugar tissue at  all. Woody layers of strongly developed fibrovascular strands were seen  to be separated one from another only by very thin layers of  parenchymatous cells. Even the number of layers is variable; it was  observed to be five in my plants; but in larger roots double this number  and even more may easily be met with.    Some authors have distinguished specific types among these wild forms.  While the cultivated beets are collected under the head of _Beta  vulgaris_, separate types with more or less woody roots have been  described as _Beta maritima_ and _Beta patula_. These show differences  in the habit of the stems and the foliage. Some have a strong tendency  to become annual, others to become biennial. The first of course do not  store a large quantity of food in their roots, and remain thin, even at  the time of flowering. The biennial types occur in all sizes of roots.  In the annuals the stems may vary from [70] erect to ascending, and the  name _patula_ indicates stems which are densely branching from the base  with widely spreading branches throughout. Mr. Em. von Proskowetz of  Kwassitz, Austria, kindly sent me seeds of this _Beta patula_, the  variability of which was so great in my cultures as to range from nearly  typical sugar-beets to the thin woody type of Bukharest.    Broad and narrow leaves are considered to be differentiating marks  between _Beta vulgaris_ and _Beta patula_, but even here a wide range of  forms seem to occur.    Rimpau, Proskowetz, Schindler and others have made cultures of beets  from wild localities in order to discover a hypothetical common ancestor  of all the present cultivated types. These researches point to the _B.  patula_ as the probable ancestor, but of course they were not made to  decide the question as to whether the origination of the several now  existing types had taken place before or during culture. From a general  point of view the variability of the wild species is parallel to that of  the cultivated forms to such a degree as to suggest the multiple origin  of the former. But a close investigation of this highly important  problem has still to be made.    The varieties of the cultivated beets are commonly [71] included in four  subspecies. The two smallest are the salad-beets and the ornamental  forms, the first being used as food, and ordinarily cultivated in red  varieties, the second being used as ornamental plants during the fall,  when they fill the beds left empty by summer flowers, with a bright  foliage that is exceedingly rich in form and color. Of the remaining  subspecies, one comprises the numerous sorts cultivated as forage-crops  and the other the true sugar-beets. Both of them vary widely as to the  shape and the size of the roots, the quality of the tissue, the foliage  and other characteristics.    Some of these forms, no doubt, have originated during culture. Most of  them have been improved by selection, and no beet found in the wild  state ever rivals any cultivated variety. But the improvement chiefly  affects the size, the amount of sugar and nutrient substances and some  other qualities which recur in most of the varieties. The varietal  attributes themselves however, are more or less of a specific nature,  and have no relation to the real industrial value of the race. The  short-rooted and the horn-shaped varieties might best be cited as  examples.    The assertion that the sundry varieties of forage-beets are not the  result of artificial selection, [72] is supported in a large measure by  the historic fact that the most of them are far older than the method of  conscious selection of plants itself. This method is due to Louis  Vilmorin and dates from the middle of the last century. But in the  sixteenth century most of our present varieties of beets were already in  cultivation. Caspar Bauhin gives a list of the beets of his time and it  is not difficult to recognize in it a large series of subspecies and  varieties and even of special forms, which are still cultivated. A more  complete list was published towards the close of the same century by  Olivier de Serres in his world-renowned \"Theatre d'Agriculture\" (Paris,  1600).    The red forage-beets which are now cultivated on so large a scale, had  been introduced from Italy into France only a short time before.    From this historic evidence, the period during which the beets were  cultivated from the time of the Romans or perhaps much later, up to the  time of Bauhin and De Serres, would seem far too short for the  production by the unguided selection of man of all the now existing  types. On the other hand, the parallelism between the characters of some  wild and some cultivated varieties goes to make it very probable that  other varieties have been found in the same way, some in this country  and others in that, [73] and have been taken into cultivation  separately. Afterwards of course all must have been improved in the  direction required by the needs of man.    Quite the same conclusion is afforded by apples. The facts are to some  extent of another character, and the rule of the derivation of the  present cultivated varieties from original wild forms can be illustrated  in this case in a more direct way. Of course we must limit ourselves to  the varieties of pure ancestry and leave aside all those which are of  hybrid or presumably hybrid origin.    Before considering their present state of culture, something must be,  said about the earlier history and the wild state of the apples.    The apple-tree is a common shrub in woods throughout all parts of  Europe, with the only exception of the extreme north. Its distribution  extends to Anatolia, the Caucasus and Ghilan in Persia. It is found in  nearly all forests of any extent and often in relatively large numbers  of individuals. It exhibits varietal characters, which have led to the  recognition of several spontaneous forms, especially in France and in  Germany.    The differentiating qualities relate to the shape and indumentum of the  leaves. Nothing is known botanically as to differences between [74] the  fruits of these varieties, but as a matter of fact the wild apples of  different countries are not at all the same.    Alphonse De Candolle, who made a profound study of the probable origin  of most of our cultivated plants, comes to the conclusion that the apple  tree must have had this wide distribution in prehistoric times, and that  its cultivation began in ancient times everywhere.    This very important conclusion by so high an authority throws  considerable light on the relation between cultivated and wild"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7238"],[0,"My Four Years in Germany (#11)"],[1,"this occurrence at Zabern. I was present at the debate in  the Reichstag, which took place on the fourth, fifth and sixth  of December, 1913. Three South Germans, a member of the Centrum,  Hauss, a Progressive named Roser, and the Socialist deputy from  Mülhausen in Alsace, Peirotes, commenced by moving and seconding  the interpellation and related in vehement language the occurrences  at Zabern. The Chancellor replied in defence of the government.  Unfortunately he had that morning received family news of a most  unpleasant character, which added to his nervousness. He spoke  with a low voice and looked like a downhearted and sick man. It  was whispered afterwards in the lobbies that he had forgotten  the most important part of his speech. The unfavourable impression  which he made was increased by von Falkenhayn, appearing for the  first time before the Reichstag. If the Reichstag members had  been disappointed by the Chancellor, they were stirred to the  highest pitch of bitterness by the speech of the War Minister. In  a sharp, commanding voice he told them that the military officers  had only done their duty, that they would not be swerved from their  path by press agents or hysterical individuals, that Forstner  was a very young officer who had been severely punished, but  that this kind of courageous young officer was the kind that  the country needed, etc. Immediately after this speech the  Progressive party moved that the attitude of the Chancellor did  not meet the approval of the representatives of the people, and  it became evident that, for the first time in the history of the  German Empire, a vote of censure directed against the government  would be debated. The debate was continued all the next day, the  Chancellor making another speech and saying what he probably had  intended to say the day before. He related what he had achieved  at Donaueschingen; that the Emperor had issued a cabinet order  saying that the military authorities should be kept within legal  bounds, that all the guilty persons would be punished, that the  Regiment, Number Ninety-nine, had been removed from Zabern, that  the absolute law of 1820 had been abolished for Alsace-Lorraine,  and that no Chancellor should for one moment tolerate disregard  of law by any government officials, civil or military, and remain  in his position.    This second speech of the Chancellor made a better impression  and somewhat affected the more extreme members of the Reichstag,  but it came too late to prevent the passage of the vote of censure  by the remarkable majority of two hundred and ninety-three to  fifty-four. Only the Conservatives voted against it. A few days  later, when the Social Democrats demanded that the Chancellor  take the consequence of the vote of distrust and resign, the  attitude of the members of all the other parties, who had been  favourably impressed by the second speech of the Chancellor,  showed that they were not yet prepared to go the length of holding  that a vote of distrust in the Reichstag must necessarily mean  the resignation of the Chancellor.    Public excitement gradually calmed down, and a complete change of  the officials at Zabern helped to bring about a normal condition  of affairs. The Viceroy, Count Wedel, and Secretary of State  Zorn von Bulach, resigned and were replaced by von Dallwitz and  Count Rödern.    However, the everlasting question came up again a little later  during the regular budget debate of the Reichstag. The Chancellor  made his speech, giving a review of the political international  situation. He was followed by Herr Scheidemann, leader of the  Social Democrats, who mercilessly attacked the Chancellor and  stated that if the Chancellor still thought that he was the right  man at the helm, he, Scheidemann, would show that the contrary was  the case. He then enumerated what he called the many political  failures of the Chancellor, the failure of the bill to amend  the Prussian franchise law, and stated that the few bills which  had been passed, such as the bill giving Alsace-Lorraine a real  constitution, had been carried only with the help of the Social  Democratic party. The speaker then once more rehashed the incidents  of the Zabern matter, referred to the attitude of the Emperor,  who, he said, had evidently been too busy with hunting and  festivities to devote time to such trivial matters as the Zabern  Affair, and also said that, if the Chancellor had refused to  withdraw, the only possible conclusion from the vote of the two  hundred and ninety-three Reichstag members, who were certainly  not influenced by personal feelings against the Chancellor, was  that the Chancellor must be sticking to his post only because  of the mistaken idea of the Emperor's authority and because he  must believe in the fetish of personal government. Scheidemann  begged that the same majority which had passed the vote of censure  should now follow it up by voting down the Chancellor's salary  and thus force him out of office.    The Chancellor immediately replied, saying that he needed no  advice from Herr Scheidemann, and that when the government had  consented to change the rules of the Reichstag he had expressly  reserved the authority either to regard or disregard any resolution  passed after an interpellation, and that formerly, after discussing  an interpellation and the answer of the government, no vote could  be taken to approve or reject a resolution expressing its opinion  of such course of action. Such resolutions might be considered as  valuable material, but it had been agreed that they could have  no binding effect either upon the government or any member of it,  and that nobody had ever dreamed that by a mere change of business  rules the whole constitution of the Empire was being changed and  authority given to the Reichstag to dismiss ministers at will;  that in France and Great Britain conditions were different, but  that parliamentary government did not exist in Germany; that it  was the constitutional privilege of the Emperor to appoint the  Chancellor without any assistance or advice from the Reichstag;  that he, the Chancellor, would resist with all his might every  attempt to change this system; and that he, therefore, refused  to resign because the resolution had no other effect than to  make it evident that a difference of opinion existed between the  Reichstag and the government.    This debate took place on December ninth, 1913, and, with the  exception of the Social Democrats and the Polish deputies, the  leaders of all parties supported the view of the Chancellor.  The motion to strike out the Chancellor's salary was voted down,  only the Social Democrats and Poles voting in favour of it.    It is unquestioned, however, that this Zabern Affair and the  consequent attitude of the whole nation, as well as the extraordinary  vote in the Reichstag, greatly alarmed the military party.    It was perhaps the final factor which decided the advocates of  the old military system of Germany in favour of a European war.  Usually in past years when the Reichstag in adjournments had risen  and cheered the name of the Emperor, the Social Democrats absented  themselves from the Chamber, but when the Reichstag adjourned on  May twentieth, 1914, these members remained in the Chamber and  refused either to rise or to cheer the Emperor. The President  of the Reichstag immediately called attention to this breach  of respect to the Emperor, upon which the Socialists shouted,  \"That is our affair,\" and tried to drown the cheers with hoots  and hisses at which the other parties applauded tumultuously.    This occurrence I know greatly incensed the Emperor and did much,  I believe, to win his consent to the war.          CHAPTER V    PSYCHOLOGY AND CAUSES WHICH PREPARED THE NATION FOR WAR    To the outsider, the Germans seem a fierce and martial nation.  But, in reality, the mass of the Germans, in consenting to the  great sacrifice entailed by their enormous preparations for war,  have been actuated by fear.    This fear dates from the Thirty Years' War, the war which commenced  in 1618 and was terminated in 1648. In 1648, when the Treaty  of Westphalia was concluded, Germany was almost a desert. Its  population had fallen from twenty millions to four millions.  The few remaining people were so starved that cannibalism was  openly practised. In the German States polygamy was legalised,  and was a recognised institution for many years thereafter.    Of thirty-five thousand Bohemian villages, only six thousand  were left standing. In the lower Palatinate only one-tenth of the  population survived; in Württemberg, only one-sixth. Hundreds of  square miles of once fertile country were overgrown with forests  inhabited only by wolves.    A picture of this horrible period is found in the curious novel,  \"The Adventurous Simplicissimus,\" written by Grimmelshausen, and  published in 1669, which describes the adventures of a wise peasant  who finally leaves his native Germany and betakes himself to a desert  island which he refuses to leave when offered an opportunity to  go back to the Fatherland. He answers those who wish to persuade  him to go back with words which seem quite appropriate to-day:  \"My God, where do you want to carry me? Here is peace. There is  war. Here I know nothing of the arts of the court, ambitions,  anger, envy, deceit, nor have I cares concerning my clothing and  nourishment.... While I still lived in Europe everything was  (O, woe that I must appear witness to such acts of Christians!)  filled with war, burning, murder, robbery, plundering and the  shame of women and virgins.\" The Munich weekly, \"Simplicissimus,\"  whose powerful political cartoons have often startled Europe,  takes its name from this character.    After the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War, Germany was again  and again ravaged by smaller wars, culminating in the Seven Years'  War of Frederick the "]]]
