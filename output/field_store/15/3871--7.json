He lay like a thing  stunned, his eyes fixed steadily on the scene of the tragedy out in the  meadow. He had seen something that he would never forget--even as he  would never quite forget his mother and Kazan and the old windfall. He  had witnessed the death of the creature he had thought all-powerful.  Wakayoo, the big bear, had not even put up a fight. Pierrot and Nepeese  had killed him WITHOUT TOUCHING HIM. Now Pierrot was cutting him with a  knife which shot silvery flashes in the sun; and Wakayoo made no  movement. It made Baree shiver, and he drew himself an inch farther  back under the rock, where he was already wedged as if he had been  shoved there by a strong hand.    He could see Nepeese. She came straight back to the break through which  his flight had taken him, and stood at last not more than twenty feet  from where he was hidden. Now that she stood where he could not escape,  she began weaving her shining hair into two thick braids. Baree had  taken his eyes from Pierrot, and he watched her curiously. He was not  afraid now. His nerves tingled. In him a strange and growing force was  struggling to solve a great mystery--the reason for his desire to creep  out from under his rock and approach that wonderful creature with the  shining eyes and the beautiful hair.    Baree wanted to approach. It was like an invisible string tugging at  his very heart. It was Kazan, and not Gray Wolf, calling to him back  through the centuries, a \"call\" that was as old as the Egyptian  pyramids and perhaps ten thousand years older. But against that desire  Gray Wolf was pulling from out the black ages of the forests. The wolf  held him quiet and motionless. Nepeese was looking about her. She was  smiling. For a moment her face was turned toward him, and he saw the  white shine of her teeth, and her beautiful eyes seemed glowing  straight at him.    And then, suddenly, she dropped on her knees and peered under the rock.    Their eyes met. For at least half a minute there was not a sound.  Nepeese did not move, and her breath came so softly that Baree could  not hear it.    Then she said, almost in a whisper:    \"Baree! Baree! Upi Baree!\"    It was the first time Baree had heard his name, and there was something  so soft and assuring in the sound of it that in spite of himself the  dog in him responded to it in a whimper that just reached the Willow's  ears. Slowly she stretched in an arm. It was bare and round and soft.  He might have darted forward the length of his body and buried his  fangs in it easily. But something held him back. He knew that it was  not an enemy. He knew that the dark eyes shining at him so wonderfully  were not filled with the desire to harm--and the voice that came to him  softly was like a strange and thrilling music.    \"Baree! Baree! Upi Baree!\"    Over and over again the Willow called to him like that, while on her  face she tried to draw herself a few inches farther under the rock. She  could not reach him. There was still a foot between her hand and Baree,  and she could not wedge herself forward an inch more. And then she saw  where on the other side of the rock there was a hollow, shut in by a  stone. If she had removed the stone, and come in that way--    She drew herself out and stood once more in the sunshine. Her heart  thrilled. Pierrot was busy over his bear--and she would not call him.  She made an effort to move the stone which closed in the hollow under  the big boulder, but it was wedged in tightly. Then she began digging  with a stick. If Pierrot had been there, his sharp eyes would have  discovered the significance of that stone, which was not larger than a  water pail. Possibly for centuries it had lain there, its support  keeping the huge rock from toppling down, just as an ounce weight may  swing the balance of a wheel that weighs a ton.    Five minutes--and Nepeese could move the stone. She tugged at it. Inch  by inch she dragged it out until at last it lay at her feet and the  opening was ready for her body. She looked again toward Pierrot. He was  still busy, and she laughed softly as she untied a big red-and-white  Bay handkerchief from about her shoulders. With this she would secure  Baree. She dropped on her hands and knees and then lowered herself flat  on the ground and began crawling into the hollow under the boulder.    Baree had moved. With the back of his head flattened against the rock,  he had heard something which Nepeese had not heard. He had felt a slow  and growing pressure, and from this pressure he had dragged himself  slowly--and the pressure still followed. The mass of rock was settling!  Nepeese did not see or hear or understand. She was calling to him more  and more pleadingly:    \"Baree--Baree--Baree--\"    Her head and shoulders and both arms were under the rock now. The glow  of her eyes was very close to Baree. He whined. The thrill of a great  and impending danger stirred in his blood. And then--    In that moment Nepeese felt the pressure of the rock on her shoulder,  and into the eyes that had been glowing softly at Baree there shot a  sudden wild look of horror. And then there came from her lips a cry  that was not like any other sound Baree had ever heard in the  wilderness--wild, piercing, filled with agonized fear. Pierrot did not  hear that first cry. But he heard the second and the third--and then  scream after scream as the Willow's tender body was slowly crushed  under the settling mass. He ran toward it with the speed of the wind.  The cries were now weaker--dying away. He saw Baree as he came out from  under the rock and ran into the canyon, and in the same instant he saw  a part of the Willow's dress and her moccasined feet. The rest of her  was hidden under the deathtrap. Like a madman Pierrot began digging.    When a few moments later he drew Nepeese out from under the boulder she  was white and deathly still. Her eyes were closed. His hand could not  feel that she was living, and a great moan of anguish rose out of his  soul. But he knew how to fight for a life. He tore open her dress and  found that she was not crushed as he had feared. Then he ran for water.  When he returned, the Willow's eyes were open and she was gasping for  breath.    \"The blessed saints be praised!\" sobbed Pierrot, falling on his knees  at her side. \"Nepeese, ma Nepeese!\"    She smiled at him, and Pierrot drew her up to him, forgetting the water  he had run so hard to get.    Still later, when he got down on his knees and peered under the rock,  his face turned white and he said:    \"Mon Dieu, if it had not been for that little hollow in the earth,  Nepeese--\"    He shuddered, and said no more. But Nepeese, happy in her salvation,  made a movement with her hand and said, smiling at him:    \"I would have been like--THAT.\" And she held her thumb and forefinger  close together.    \"But where did Baree go, mon pere?\" Nepeese cried.        CHAPTER 9    Impelled by the wild alarm of the Willow's terrible cries and the sight  of Pierrot dashing madly toward him from the dead body of Wakayoo,  Baree did not stop running until it seemed as though his lungs could  not draw another breath. When he stopped, he was well out of the canyon  and headed for the beaver pond. For almost a week Baree had not been  near the pond. He had not forgotten Beaver Tooth and Umisk and the  other little beavers, but Wakayoo and his daily catch of fresh fish had  been too big a temptation for him. Now Wakayoo was gone. He sensed the  fact that the big black bear would never fish again in the quiet pools  and shimmering eddies, and that where for many days there had been  peace and plenty, there was now great danger. And just as in another  country he would have fled for safety to the old windfall, he now fled  desperately for the beaver pond.    Exactly wherein lay Baree's fears it would be difficult to say--but  surely it was not because of Nepeese. The Willow had chased him hard.  She had flung herself upon him. He had felt the clutch of her hands and  the smother of her soft hair, and yet of her he was not afraid! If he  stopped now and then in his flight and looked back, it was to see if  Nepeese was following. He would not have run hard from her--alone. Her  eyes and voice and hands had set something stirring in him; he was  filled with a greater yearning and a greater loneliness now. And that  night he dreamed troubled dreams.    He found himself a bed under a spruce root not far from the beaver  pond, and all through the night his sleep was filled with that restless  dreaming--dreams of his mother, of Kazan, the old windfall, of  Umlsk--and of Nepeese. Once, when he awoke, he thought the spruce root  was Gray Wolf; and when he found that she was not there, Pierrot and  the Willow could have told what his crying meant if they had heard it.  Again and again he had visions of the thrilling happenings of that day.  He saw the flight of Wakayoo over the little meadow--he saw him die  again. He saw the glow of the Willow's eyes close to his own, heard her  voice--so sweet and low that it seemed like strange music to him--and  again he heard her terrible screams.    Baree was glad when the dawn came. He did not seek for food, but went  down to the pond. There was little hope and anticipation in his manner  now. He remembered that, as plainly as animal ways could talk, Umisk  and his playmates had told him they wanted nothing to do with him. And  yet the fact that they were there took away some of his loneliness. It  was more than loneliness. The wolf in him was submerged. The dog was  master. And in these passing moments, when the blood of the wild was  almost dormant in him, he was depressed by the instinctive and growing  feeling that he was not of that wild, but a fugitive in it, menaced on  all sides by strange dangers.

Kimball's Journal (#11)"],[1,"numbers of our friends and brethren, some of whom were so glad to  see us that tears started in their eyes when we took them by the hand.    There is indeed something peculiarly pleasing to the Saint, who,  after a long separation, beholds the friends to whom he is united  in bonds the most sacred, and with whom he has probably traveled to  preach the gospel, and with them passed through many scenes of sorrow  and affliction. At that time every pleasing association is revived,  and memory fondly clings to those scenes, the contemplation of which  affords pleasure, while every thing of an opposite nature is forgotten  and buried in oblivion.    During our journey from Kirtland to Missouri, the weather was  remarkably warm, in consequence of which I suffered very much, and my  body was broken down by sickness, and I continued very feeble for a  considerable length of time.    The first Sunday after my arrival at Far West I was called upon to  preach to the Saints, which I endeavored to do, although I was scarcely  able to stand. I related many things respecting my mission and travels,  which were gladly received by the brethren, whose hearts were cheered  by the recital, while many of the Elders were stirred up to diligence,  and expressed a great desire to accompany us when we should return to  England.    Soon after my arrival, I had a lot given me by Bishop Partridge, and  also sufficient timber to build me a house. While it was being erected,  I lived in a place I built for my cow, about eleven feet square, and in  which I could hardly stand upright. The brethren were remarkably kind  and contributed to my necessities. One of them by the name of Charles  Hubbard, made me a present of forty acres of land, another gave me a  cow, etc.    When I had nearly finished my house, and after much labor, I was  obliged to abandon it to the mob, who at that time commenced  persecuting the Saints, driving off their cattle and destroying their  property.    It will not be expected that I should recapitulate the circumstances  which then transpired, which were of an extraordinary character, as  numbers have written on the subject. Suffice it to say, that the Saints  suffered privations, hunger, abuse, cold, famine, and many of them  death. Yes, the blood of the Saints has stained the soil of Missouri,  for which the King of kings and Lord of hosts will recompense upon her  the punishment of her crimes.    From about the 6th of August until the 1st of November it was a  continual scene of agitation and alarm, both by night and by day. The  enemies of righteousness were determined to overthrow the Saints,  and, regardless of all laws (which were trampled upon with impunity),  they made every preparation, and used every means in their power to  accomplish their unhallowed designs.    The Saints, tenacious of their liberties and sacred rights, resisted  these unlawful designs, and with courage worthy of them, they guarded  their families and their homes from the aggressions of the mob, but not  without the loss of several lives, among whom was my greatly esteemed  and much lamented friend, Elder David W. Patten, who fell a sacrifice  to the fell spirit of persecution, and a martyr to the cause of truth.  The circumstances of his death I will briefly relate:    It being ascertained that a mob had collected on Crooked River, in the  County of Caldwell, a company of sixty or seventy persons immediately  volunteered from Far West to watch their movements and repel their  attacks, and chose Elder Patten for their commander. They commenced  their march about midnight and came up to the mob very early next  morning, and as soon as the brethren approached near to them, they were  fired upon, when Captain Patten received a shot which proved fatal. The  mob after firing ran away. Several others of the brethren were wounded  at the same time, some of whom afterwards died.    Immediately on receiving the intelligence that Brother Patten was  wounded, I hastened to see him. When I arrived he appeared to be in  great pain, but still was glad to see me. He was conveyed about four  miles to the house of Brother Winchester. During his removal his  sufferings were so excruciating, that he frequently desired us to lay  him down that he might die. But being desirous to get him out of the  reach of the mob and among friends, we prevailed upon him to let us  convey him there.    He lived about an hour after his arrival, and was perfectly sensible  and collected until he breathed his last. He had medical assistance,  yet his wound was such that there was no hope entertained of his  recovery. This he was perfectly aware of. In this situation, while the  shades of time were lowering and eternity with all its realities was  opening to his view, he bore a strong testimony to the truth of the  work of the Lord and the religion he had espoused.    The principles of the gospel which were so precious to him before, were  honorably maintained in nature's final hour, and afforded him that  support and consolation at the time of his departure which deprived  death of its sting and its horror.    Speaking of those who had fallen from their steadfastness, he  exclaimed, \"O that they were in my situation; for I feel that I have  kept the faith; I have finished my course; henceforth there is laid up  for me a crown which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give to me,\"  etc.    Speaking to his beloved partner, who was present, and who attended  him in his dying moments, he said, \"Whatever you do else, O, do not  deny the faith!\" He all the while expressed a great desire to depart.  I spoke to him and said, \"Brother David, when you get home I want you  to remember me.\" He immediately exclaimed, \"I will.\" At this time his  sight was gone.    We felt so very much attached to our beloved brother, that we beseeched  the Lord to spare his life and endeavored to exercise faith in the Lord  for his recovery. Of this he was perfectly aware, and expressed a wish  that we should let him go, as his desire was to be with Christ.    A few minutes before he died he prayed as follows: \"Father, I ask thee,  in the name of Jesus Christ, that thou wouldst release my spirit and  receive it unto Thyself!\" and then said to those who surrounded his  dying bed, \"Brethren, you have held me by your faith, but do give me  up, and let me go, I beseech you.\"    We then committed him to God, and he soon breathed his last, and slept  in Jesus without a groan.    This was the end of one who was an honor to the Church and a blessing  to the Saints, and whose faith and virtues and diligence in the cause  of truth will be long remembered by all who had the pleasure of his  acquaintance; and his memory will be had in remembrance by the Church  of Christ from generation to generation.    It was indeed a painful circumstance to be deprived of the labors of  this worthy servant of Christ, and it east a gloom over the Saints;  yet the glorious and sealing testimony which he bore of his acceptance  with heaven, and the truth of the gospel, was a matter of joy and  satisfaction, not only to his immediate friends, but to the Saints at  large.    I remained in the State of Missouri until the 26th of April, A. D.  1839, it being the time appointed by revelation for the Twelve to take  their leave of the building spot of the house of the Lord and take  their journey across the ocean, and notwithstanding the threats of our  enemies that this prophecy should fail, we assembled on the public  square, at Far West, assisted Elder Alpheus Cutler to lay the corner  foundation stone, sang a hymn and united in prayer to God that He would  give us a prosperous mission.    During my stay in Missouri, I frequently went to see the brethren who  were confined in prison for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of  God. Many times after I had traveled forty or fifty miles to see them,  I was denied the privilege by the jailor and the guards.    I was with the brethren in nearly all their movements in the west,  and can bear testimony to their faith and virtues, and know they were  entirely innocent of the crimes alleged against them, and that their  persecutions were brought upon them on account of their attachment to  the gospel and to the Saints of the Lord.    Although they were in the Lands of their enemies, who threatened to  kill them, I always had the testimony that they would be delivered and  come forth victorious.    After the 26th of April, A. D. 1839, I took leave of Far West, and in  company with my brethren traveled to Illinois, where my family had  removed some time previous, and I had the unspeakable pleasure of  seeing my beloved friends, the First Presidency and others who had been  delivered out of the hands of their enemies and had arrived safely in  Illinois.    Soon after a general conference of the Church was held near Quincy, at  which the Saints from all the regions round about assembled. It was a  time which will long be remembered by the Saints, it being the first  conference held after their expulsion.        CHAPTER XI.    FAR WEST BESIEGED--JOSEPH SMITH AND BRETHREN BETRAYED BY  APOSTATES--ATROCITIES OF MOB--CONVERSATION WITH W. E.  M'LELLIN--EXTERMINATION SPEECH OF GENERAL CLARK.    Before I proceed farther with my narrative, it may perhaps be as well  to revert to some other things that transpired in Missouri:    After witnessing the death of D. W. Patten, I took Dr. Avard with  me to Far West, a distance of three miles, to Elder Rigdon's house,  where we found Brother Patrick O'Banion, who was shot in nearly the  same place as Brother Patten (he was a member of Zion's Camp in 1834).  He also died in a short time, firm and steadfast in the faith, was  perfectly calm and composed, and bore a strong testimony to the truth  of \"Mormonism.\"    Gideon Carter, who was also a faithful Saint, was shot in the head and  left dead on the ground, so defaced that the brethren did not at first"]]]
