And these  reasons, on one side and the other, are such, that not only is it in  some measure my interest here to state them, but that of the public,  perhaps, to know them.    I have never made much account of what has proceeded from my own mind;  and so long as I gathered no other advantage from the method I employ  beyond satisfying myself on some difficulties belonging to the  speculative sciences, or endeavoring to regulate my actions according  to the principles it taught me, I never thought myself bound to publish  anything respecting it.  For in what regards manners, every one is so  full of his own wisdom, that there might be found as many reformers as  heads, if any were allowed to take upon themselves the task of mending  them, except those whom God has constituted the supreme rulers of his  people or to whom he has given sufficient grace and zeal to be  prophets; and although my speculations greatly pleased myself, I  believed that others had theirs, which perhaps pleased them still more.  But as soon as I had acquired some general notions respecting physics,  and beginning to make trial of them in various particular difficulties,  had observed how far they can carry us, and how much they differ from  the principles that have been employed up to the present time, I  believed that I could not keep them concealed without sinning  grievously against the law by which we are bound to promote, as far as  in us lies, the general good of mankind.  For by them I perceived it to  be possible to arrive at knowledge highly useful in life; and in room  of the speculative philosophy usually taught in the schools, to  discover a practical, by means of which, knowing the force and action  of fire, water, air the stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies  that surround us, as distinctly as we know the various crafts of our  artisans, we might also apply them in the same way to all the uses to  which they are adapted, and thus render ourselves the lords and  possessors of nature.  And this is a result to be desired, not only in  order to the invention of an infinity of arts, by which we might be  enabled to enjoy without any trouble the fruits of the earth, and all  its comforts, but also and especially for the preservation of health,  which is without doubt, of all the blessings of this life, the first  and fundamental one; for the mind is so intimately dependent upon the  condition and relation of the organs of the body, that if any means can  ever be found to render men wiser and more ingenious than hitherto, I  believe that it is in medicine they must be sought for.  It is true  that the science of medicine, as it now exists, contains few things  whose utility is very remarkable:  but without any wish to depreciate  it, I am confident that there is no one, even among those whose  profession it is, who does not admit that all at present known in it is  almost nothing in comparison of what remains to be discovered; and that  we could free ourselves from an infinity of maladies of body as well as  of mind, and perhaps also even from the debility of age, if we had  sufficiently ample knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies  provided for us by nature.  But since I designed to employ my whole  life in the search after so necessary a science, and since I had fallen  in with a path which seems to me such, that if any one follow it he  must inevitably reach the end desired, unless he be hindered either by  the shortness of life or the want of experiments, I judged that there  could be no more effectual provision against these two impediments than  if I were faithfully to communicate to the public all the little I  might myself have found, and incite men of superior genius to strive to  proceed farther, by contributing, each according to his inclination and  ability, to the experiments which it would be necessary to make, and  also by informing the public of all they might discover, so that, by  the last beginning where those before them had left off, and thus  connecting the lives and labours of many, we might collectively proceed  much farther than each by himself could do.    I remarked, moreover, with respect to experiments, that they become  always more necessary the more one is advanced in knowledge; for, at  the commencement, it is better to make use only of what is  spontaneously presented to our senses, and of which we cannot remain  ignorant, provided we bestow on it any reflection, however slight, than  to concern ourselves about more uncommon and recondite phenomena:  the  reason of which is, that the more uncommon often only mislead us so  long as the causes of the more ordinary are still unknown; and the  circumstances upon which they depend are almost always so special and  minute as to be highly difficult to detect.  But in this I have adopted  the following order:  first, I have essayed to find in general the  principles, or first causes of all that is or can be in the world,  without taking into consideration for this end anything but God himself  who has created it, and without educing them from any other source than  from certain germs of truths naturally existing in our minds In the  second place, I examined what were the first and most ordinary effects  that could be deduced from these causes; and it appears to me that, in  this way, I have found heavens, stars, an earth, and even on the earth  water, air, fire, minerals, and some other things of this kind, which  of all others are the most common and simple, and hence the easiest to  know.  Afterwards when I wished to descend to the more particular, so  many diverse objects presented themselves to me, that I believed it to  be impossible for the human mind to distinguish the forms or species of  bodies that are upon the earth, from an infinity of others which might  have been, if it had pleased God to place them there, or consequently  to apply them to our use, unless we rise to causes through their  effects, and avail ourselves of many particular experiments.  Thereupon, turning over in my mind I the objects that had ever been  presented to my senses I freely venture to state that I have never  observed any which I could not satisfactorily explain by the principles  had discovered.  But it is necessary also to confess that the power of  nature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and  general, that I have hardly observed a single particular effect which I  cannot at once recognize as capable of being deduced in man different  modes from the principles, and that my greatest difficulty usually is  to discover in which of these modes the effect is dependent upon them;  for out of this difficulty cannot otherwise extricate myself than by  again seeking certain experiments, which may be such that their result  is not the same, if it is in the one of these modes at we must explain  it, as it would be if it were to be explained in the other.  As to what  remains, I am now in a position to discern, as I think, with sufficient  clearness what course must be taken to make the majority those  experiments which may conduce to this end:  but I perceive likewise  that they are such and so numerous, that neither my hands nor my  income, though it were a thousand times larger than it is, would be  sufficient for them all; so that according as henceforward I shall have  the means of making more or fewer experiments, I shall in the same  proportion make greater or less progress in the knowledge of nature.  This was what I had hoped to make known by the treatise I had written,  and so clearly to exhibit the advantage that would thence accrue to the  public, as to induce all who have the common good of man at heart, that  is, all who are virtuous in truth, and not merely in appearance, or  according to opinion, as well to communicate to me the experiments they  had already made, as to assist me in those that remain to be made.    But since that time other reasons have occurred to me, by which I have  been led to change my opinion, and to think that I ought indeed to go  on committing to writing all the results which I deemed of any moment,  as soon as I should have tested their truth, and to bestow the same  care upon them as I would have done had it been my design to publish  them.  This course commended itself to me, as well because I thus  afforded myself more ample inducement to examine them thoroughly, for  doubtless that is always more narrowly scrutinized which we believe  will be read by many, than that which is written merely for our private  use (and frequently what has seemed to me true when I first conceived  it, has appeared false when I have set about committing it to writing),  as because I thus lost no opportunity of advancing the interests of the  public, as far as in me lay, and since thus likewise, if my writings  possess any value, those into whose hands they may fall after my death  may be able to put them to what use they deem proper.  But I resolved  by no means to consent to their publication during my lifetime, lest  either the oppositions or the controversies to which they might give  rise, or even the reputation, such as it might be, which they would  acquire for me, should be any occasion of my losing the time that I had  set apart for my own improvement.  For though it be true that every one  is bound to promote to the extent of his ability the good of others,  and that to be useful to no one is really to be worthless, yet it is  likewise true that our cares ought to extend beyond the present, and it  is good to omit doing what might perhaps bring some profit to the  living, when we have in view the accomplishment of other ends that will  be of much greater advantage to posterity.  And in truth, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],[0,"Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#11)"],[1,"in a man's mind, and stays there, and he never could tell you     why: it just seems it was the thing he wanted.\"    Take this alongside of his remark made to his mother while still a  youth--\"that he did not care to understand the strain on a bridge\" (when  he tried to study engineering); what he wanted was something with human  nature in it.  His style, in his essays, etc., where he writes in his own  person, is most polished, full of phrases finely drawn; when he speaks  through others, as in _Kidnapped_ and _David Balfour_, it is still fine  and effective, and generally it is fairly true to the character, with  cunning glimpses, nevertheless, of his own temper and feeling too.  He  makes us feel his confidants and friends, as has been said.  One could  almost construct a biography from his essays and his novels--the one  would give us the facts of his life suffused with fancy and ideal colour,  humour and fine observation not wanting; the other would give us the  history of his mental and moral being and development, and of the traits  and determinations which he drew from along a lengthened line of  progenitors.  How characteristic it is of him--a man who for so many  years suffered as an invalid--that he should lay it down that the two  great virtues, including all others, were cheerfulness and delight in  labour.    One writer has very well said on this feature in Stevenson:       \"Other authors have struggled bravely against physical weakness, but     their work has not usually been of a creative order, dependent for its     success on high animal spirits.  They have written histories, essays,     contemplative or didactic poems, works which may more or less be     regarded as 'dull narcotics numbing pain.'  But who, in so fragile a     frame as Robert Louis Stevenson's, has retained such indomitable     elasticity, such fertility of invention, such unflagging energy, not     merely to collect and arrange, but to project and body forth?  Has any     true 'maker' been such an incessant sufferer?  From his childhood, as     he himself said apropos of the _Child's Garden_, he could 'speak with     less authority of gardens than of that other \"land of counterpane.\"'     There were, indeed, a few years of adolescence during which his health     was tolerable, but they were years of apprenticeship to life and art     ('pioching,' as he called it), not of serious production.  Though he     was a precocious child, his genius ripened slowly, and it was just     reaching maturity when the 'wolverine,' as he called his disease,     fixed its fangs in his flesh.  From that time forward not only did he     live with death at his elbow in an almost literal sense (he used to     carry his left arm in a sling lest a too sudden movement should bring     on a haemorrhage), but he had ever-recurring intervals of weeks and     months during which he was totally unfit for work; while even at the     best of times he had to husband his strength most jealously.  Add to     all this that he was a slow and laborious writer, who would take more     pains with a phrase than Scott with a chapter--then look at the     stately shelf of his works, brimful of impulse, initiative, and the     joy of life, and say whether it be an exaggeration to call his     tenacity and fortitude unique!\"    Samoa, with its fine climate, prolonged his life--we had fain hoped that  in that air he found so favourable he might have lived for many years, to  add to the precious stock of innocent delight he has given to the  world--to do yet more and greater.  It was not to be.  They buried him,  with full native honours as to a chief, on the top of Vaea mountain, 1300  feet high--a road for the coffin to pass being cut through the woods on  the slopes of the hill.  There he has a resting-place not all unfit--for  he sought the pure and clearer air on the heights from whence there are  widest prospects; yet not in the spot he would have chosen--for his heart  was at home, and not very long before his death he sang, surely with  pathetic reference now:       \"Spring shall come, come again, calling up the moorfowl,     Spring shall bring the sun and rain, bring the bees and flowers,     Red shall the heather bloom over hill and valley,     Soft flow the stream thro' the even-flowing hours;     Fair the day shine, as it shone upon my childhood--        Fair shine the day on the house with open door;     Birds come and cry there, and twitter in the chimney--        But I go for ever and come again no more.\"          CHAPTER X--A SAMOAN MEMORIAL OF R. L. STEVENSON      A few weeks after his death, the mail from Samoa, brought to Stevenson's  friends, myself among the number, a precious, if pathetic, memorial of  the master.  It is in the form of \"A Letter to Mr Stevenson's Friends,\"  by his stepson, Mr Lloyd Osbourne, and bears the motto from Walt Whitman,  \"I have been waiting for you these many years.  Give me your hand and  welcome.\"  Mr Osbourne gives a full account of the last hours.       \"He wrote hard all that morning of the last day; his half-finished     book, _Hermiston_, he judged the best he had ever written, and the     sense of successful effort made him buoyant and happy as nothing else     could.  In the afternoon the mail fell to be answered--not business     correspondence, for this was left till later--but replies to the long,     kindly letters of distant friends received but two days since, and     still bright in memory.  At sunset he came downstairs; rallied his     wife about the forebodings she could not shake off; talked of a     lecturing tour to America that he was eager to make, 'as he was now so     well'; and played a game of cards with her to drive away her     melancholy.  He said he was hungry; begged her assistance to help him     make a salad for the evening meal; and, to enhance the little feast he     brought up a bottle of old Burgundy from the cellar.  He was helping     his wife on the verandah, and gaily talking, when suddenly he put both     hands to his head and cried out, 'What's that?'  Then he asked     quickly, 'Do I look strange?'  Even as he did so he fell on his knees     beside her.  He was helped into the great hall, between his wife and     his body-servant, Sosimo, losing consciousness instantly as he lay     back in the armchair that had once been his grandfather's.  Little     time was lost in bringing the doctors--Anderson of the man-of-war, and     his friend, Dr Funk.  They looked at him and shook their heads; they     laboured strenuously, and left nothing undone.  But he had passed the     bounds of human skill.  He had grown so well and strong, that his     wasted lungs were unable to bear the stress of returning health.\"    Then 'tis told how the Rev. Mr Clarke came and prayed by him; and how,  soon after, the chiefs were summoned, and came, bringing their fine mats,  which, laid on the body, almost hid the Union jack in which it had been  wrapped.  One of the old Mataafa chiefs, who had been in prison, and who  had been one of those who worked on the making of the \"Road of the Loving  Heart\" (the road of gratitude which the chiefs had made up to Mr  Stevenson's house as a mark of their appreciation of his efforts on their  behalf), came and crouched beside the body and said:       \"I am only a poor Samoan, and ignorant.  Others are rich, and can give     Tusitala {6} the parting presents of rich, fine mats; I am poor, and     can give nothing this last day he receives his friends.  Yet I am not     afraid to come and look the last time in my friend's face, never to     see him more till we meet with God.  Behold!  Tusitala is dead;     Mataafa is also dead.  These two great friends have been taken by God.     When Mataafa was taken, who was our support but Tusitala?  We were in     prison, and he cared for us.  We were sick, and he made us well.  We     were hungry, and he fed us.  The day was no longer than his kindness.     You are great people, and full of love.  Yet who among you is so great     as Tusitala?  What is your love to his love?  Our clan was Mataafa's     clan, for whom I speak this day; therein was Tusitala also.  We mourn     them both.\"    A select company of Samoans would not be deterred, and watched by the  body all night, chanting songs, with bits of Catholic prayers; and in the  morning the work began of clearing a path through the wood on the hill to  the spot on the crown where Mr Stevenson had expressed a wish to be  buried.  The following prayer, which Mr Stevenson had written and read  aloud to his family only the night before, was read by Mr Clarke in the  service:       \"We beseech thee, Lord, to behold us with favour, folk of many     families and nations, gathered together in the peace of this roof;     weak men and women, subsisting under the covert of Thy patience.  Be     patient still; suffer us yet a while longer--with our broken purposes     of good, with our idle endeavours against evil--suffer us a while     longer to endure, and (if it may be) help us to do better.  Bless to     us our extraordinary mercies; if the day come when these must be     taken, have us play the man under affliction.  Be with our friends; be     with ourselves.  Go with each of us to rest: if any awake, temper to     them the dark hours of watching; and when the day returns to us, our     Sun and Comforter, call us up with morning faces and with morning     hearts--eager to labour--eager to be happy, if happiness shall be our     portion; and if the day be marked for sorrow, strong to endure it.       \"We thank Thee and praise Thee, and in the words of Him to whom this     day is sacred, close our oblations.\"    Mr Bazzet M. Haggard, H.B.M., Land-Commissioner, tells, by way of  reminiscence, the story of \"The Road of Good Heart,\" how it came to be  built, and of the great feast Mr Stevenson gave at the close of the work,  at which, in the course of his speech, he said:      "]]]
