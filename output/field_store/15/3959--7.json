Draw off your men and I will fight them  singly. I could have killed you six times to-night, but I believe you to  be a brave man, and would not murder you. Give a lame man a show.\"    It was too late for parley. All this time Booth's voice had sounded from  the middle of the barn.    Ere he ceased speaking, Colonel Conger, slipping around to the rear,  drew some loose straws through a crack, and lit a match upon them. They  were dry and blazed up in an instant, carrying a sheet of smoke and  flame through the parted planks, and heaving in a twinkling a world of  light and heat upon the magazine within. The blaze lit up the black  recesses of the great barn till every wasp's nest and cobweb in the roof  was luminous, flinging streaks of red and violet across the tumbled farm  gear in the corner, plows, harrows, hoes, rakes, sugar mills, and making  every separate grain in the high bin adjacent, gleam like a mote of  precious gold. They tinged the beams, the upright columns, the  barricades, where clover and timothy, piled high, held toward the hot  incendiary their separate straws for the funeral pile. They bathed the  murderer's retreat in beautiful illumination, and while in bold outline  his figure stood revealed, they rose like an impenetrable wall to guard  from sight the hated enemy who lit them. Behind the blaze, with his eye  to a crack, Conger saw Wilkes Booth standing upright upon a crutch. He  likens him at this instant to his brother Edwin, whom he says he so much  resembled that he half believed, for the moment the whole pursuit to  have been a mistake. At the gleam of the fire Wilkes dropped his crutch,  and, carbine in both hands, crept up to the spot to espy the incendiary  and shoot him dead. His eyes were lustrous like fever, and swelled and  rolled in terrible beauty, while his teeth were fixed, and he wore the  expression of one in the calmness before frenzy. In vain he peered with  vengeance in his look; the blaze that made him visible concealed his  enemy. A second he turned glaring at the fire, as if to leap upon it and  extinguish it, but it had made such headway that this was a futile  impulse and he dismissed it. As calmly as upon the battlefield a veteran  stands amidst the hail of ball and shell, and plunging iron, Booth  turned at a man's stride, and pushed for the door, carbine in poise, and  the last resolve of death, which we name despair, set on his high,  bloodless forehead.    As so he dashed, intent to expire not unaccompanied, a disobedient  sergeant at an eye-hole drew upon him the fatal bead. The barn was all  glorious with conflagration and in the beautiful ruin this outlawed man  strode like all that, we know of wicked valor, stern in the face of  death. A shock, a shout, a gathering up of his splendid figure as if to  overtip the stature God gave him, and John Wilkes Booth fell headlong to  the floor, lying there in a heap, a little life remaining.    \"He has shot himself!\" cried Baker, unaware of the source of the report,  and rushing in, he grasped his arms to guard against any feint or  strategy. A moment convinced him that further struggle with the prone  flesh was useless. Booth did not move, nor breathe, nor gasp. Conger and  two sergeants now entered, and taking up the body, they bore it in haste  from the advancing flame, and laid it without upon the grass, all fresh  with heavenly dew.    \"Water,\" cried Conger, \"bring water.\"    When this was dashed into his face, he revived a moment and stirred his  lips. Baker put his ear close down, and heard him say:    \"Tell mother--and die--for my country.\"    They lifted him again, the fire encroaching in hotness upon them and  placed him on the porch before the dwelling.    A mattrass was brought down, on which they placed him and propped his  head, and gave him water and brandy. The women of the household, joined  meantime by another son, who had been found in one of the corn cribs,  watching as he said, to see that Booth and Harold did not steal the  horses, were nervous, but prompt to do the dying man all kindnesses,  although waived sternly back by the detectives. They dipped a rag in  brandy and water, and this being put between Booth's teeth he sucked it  greedily. When he was able to articulate again, he muttered to Mr. Baker  the same words, with an addenda. \"Tell mother I died for my country. I  thought I did for the best.\" Baker repeated this, saying at the same  time \"Booth, do I repeat it correctly.\" Booth nodded his head. By this  time the grayness of dawn was approaching; moving figures inquisitively  coming near were to be seen distinctly, and the cocks began to crow  gutturally, though the barn was a hulk of blaze and ashes, sending  toward the zenith a spiral line of dense smoke. The women became  importunate that the troops might be ordered to extinguish the fire,  which was spreading toward their precious corn-cribs. Not even death  could banish the call of interest. Soldiers were sent to put out the  fire, and Booth, relieved of the bustle around him, drew near to death  apace. Twice he was heard to say, \"kill me, kill me.\" His lips often  moved but could complete no appreciable sound. He made once a motion  which the quick eye of Conger understood to mean that his throat pained  him. Conger put his finger there, when the dying man attempted to cough,  but only caused the blood at his perforated neck to flow more, lively.  He bled very little, although shot quite through, beneath and behind the  ears, his collar being severed on both sides.    A soldier had been meanwhile despatched for a doctor, but the route and  return were quite six miles, and the sinner was sinking fast. Still the  women made efforts to get to see him, but were always rebuffed, and all  the brandy they could find was demanded by the assassin, who motioned  for strong drink every two minutes. He made frequent desires to be  turned over, not by speech, but by gesture, and was alternately placed  upon his back, belly and side. His tremendous vitality evidenced itself  almost miraculously. Now and then, his heart would cease to throb, and  his pulses would be as cold as a dead man's. Directly life would begin  anew, the face would flush up effulgently, the eyes open and brighten,  and soon relapsing, stillness re-asserted, would again be dispossessed  by the same magnificent triumph of man over mortality. Finally the fussy  little doctor arrived, in time to be useless. He probed the wound to see  if the ball were not in it, and shook his head sagely, and talked  learnedly.    Just at his coming Booth had asked to have his hands raised and shown  him. They were so paralyzed that he did not know their location. When  they were displayed he muttered, with a sad lethargy, \"Useless,  useless.\" These were the last words he ever uttered. As he began to die  the sun rose and threw beams into all the tree-tops. It was of a man's  height when the struggle of death twitched and fingered in the fading  bravo's face. His jaw drew spasmodically and obliquely downward; his  eyeballs rolled to-ward his feet, and began to swell; lividness, like a  horrible shadow, fastened upon him, and, with a sort of gurgle and  sudden check, he stretched his feet and threw his head back and gave up  the ghost.    They sewed him up in a saddle blanket. This was his shroud; too like a  soldier's. Harold, meantime, had been tied to a tree, but was now  released for the march. Colonel Conger pushed on immediately for  Washington; the cortege was to follow. Booth's only arms were his  carbine knife, and two revolvers. They found about him bills of  exchange, Canada money, and a diary. A venerable old negro living in the  vicinity had the misfortune to possess a horse. This horse was a relic  of former generations, and showed by his protruding ribs the general  leanness of the land. He moved in an eccentric amble, and when put upon  his speed was generally run backward. To this old negro's horse was  harnessed a very shaky and absurd wagon, which rattled like approaching  dissolution, and each part of it ran without any connection or  correspondence with any other part. It had no tail-board, and its shafts  were sharp as famine; and into this mimicry of a vehicle the murderer  was to be sent to the Potomac river, while the man he had murdered was  moving in state across the mourning continent. The old negro geared up  his wagon by means of a set of fossil harness, and when it was backed to  Garrett's porch, they laid within it the discolored corpse. The corpse  was tied with ropes around the legs and made fast to the wagon sides.  Harold's legs were tied to stirrups, and he was placed in the centre of  four murderous looking cavalrymen. The two sons of Garrett were also  taken along, despite the sobs and petitions of the old folks and women,  but the rebel captain who had given Booth a lift, got off amidst the  night's agitations, and was not rearrested. So moved the cavalcade of  retribution, with death in its midst, along the road to Port Royal. When  the wagon started, Booth's wound till now scarcely dribbling, began to  run anew. It fell through the crack of the wagon, dripping upon the  axle, and spotting the road with terrible wafers. It stained the planks,  and soaked the blankets; and the old negro, at a stoppage, dabbled his  hands in it by mistake; he drew back instantly, with a shudder and  stifled expletive, \"Gor-r-r, dat'll never come off in de world; it's  murderer's blood.\" He wrung his hands, and looked imploringly at the  officers, and shuddered again: \"Gor-r-r, I wouldn't have dat on me fur  tousand, tousand dollars.\" The progress of the team was slow, with  frequent danger of shipwreck altogether, but toward noon the cortege  filed through Port Royal, where the citizens came out to ask the matter,  and why a man's body, covered with sombre blankets, was going by with so  great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6630"],[0,"Curiosities of the Sky (#11)"],[1,"to see the new star in Auriga, beheld a strange object in the  constellation Perseus not far from the celebrated variable star Algol.  He recognized its character at once, and immediately telegraphed the  news, which awoke the startled attention of astronomers all over the  world. When first seen the new star was no brighter than Algol (less  than the second magnitude), but within twenty-four hours it was  ablaze, outshining even the brilliant Capella, and far surpassing the  first magnitude. At the spot in the sky where it appeared nothing  whatever was visible on the night before its coming. This is known  with certainty because a photograph had been made of that very region  on February 21, and this photograph showed everything down to the  twelfth magnitude, but not a trace of the stranger which burst into  view between the 21st and the 22nd like the explosion of a rocket.    Upon one who knew the stars the apparition of this intruder in a  well-known constellation had the effect of a sudden invasion. The new  star was not far west of the zenith in the early evening, and in that  position showed to the best advantage. To see Capella, the hitherto  unchallenged ruler of that quarter of the sky, abased by comparison  with this stranger of alien aspect, for there was always an unfamiliar  look about the ``nova,'' was decidedly disconcerting. It seemed to  portend the beginning of a revolution in the heavens. One could  understand what the effect of such an apparition must have been in the  superstitious times of Tycho. The star of Tycho had burst forth on the  northern border of the Milky Way; this one was on its southern border,  some forty-five degrees farther east.    Astronomers were well-prepared this time for the scientific study of  the new star, both astronomical photography and spectroscopy having  been perfected, and the results of their investigations were  calculated to increase the wonder with which the phenomenon was  regarded. The star remained at its brightest only a few days; then,  like a veritable conflagration, it began to languish; and, like the  reflection of a dying fire, as it sank it began to glow with the red  color of embers. But its changes were spasmodic; once about every  three days it flared up only to die away again. During these  fluctuations its light varied alternately in the ratio of one to six.  Finally it took a permanent downward course, and after a few months  the naked eye could no longer perceive it; but it remained visible  with telescopes, gradually fading until it had sunk to the ninth  magnitude. Then another astonishing change happened: in August  photographs taken at the Yerkes Observatory and at Heidelberg showed  that the ``nova'' was surrounded by a spiral nebula! The nebula had  not been there before, and no one could doubt that it represented a  phase of the same catastrophe that had produced the outburst of the  new star. At one time the star seemed virtually to have disappeared,  as if all its substance had been expanded into the nebulous cloud, but  always there remained a stellar nucleus about which the misty spiral  spread wider and ever wider, like a wave expanding around a center of  disturbance. The nebula too showed a variability of brightness, and  four condensations which formed in it seemed to have a motion of  revolution about the star. As time went on the nebula continued to  expand at a rate which was computed to be not less than twenty  thousand miles per second! And now the star itself, showing  indications of having turned into a nebula, behaved in a most erratic  manner, giving rise to the suspicion that it was about to burst out  again. But this did not occur, and at length it sunk into a state of  lethargy from which it has to the present time not recovered. But the  nebulous spiral has disappeared, and the entire phenomena as it now  (1909) exists consists of a faint nebulous star of less than the ninth  magnitude.    The wonderful transformations just described had been forecast in  advance of the discovery of the nebulous spiral encircling the star by  the spectroscopic study of the latter. At first there was no  suggestion of a nebular constitution, but within a month or two  characteristic nebular lines began to appear, and in less than six  months the whole spectrum had been transformed to the nebular type. In  the mean time the shifting of the spectral lines indicated a  complication of rapid motions in several directions simultaneously.  These motions were estimated to amount to from one hundred to five  hundred miles per second.    The human mind is so constituted that it feels forced to seek an  explanation of so marvelous a phenomenon as this, even in the absence  of the data needed for a sound conclusion. The most natural  hypothesis, perhaps, is that of a collision. Such a catastrophe could  certainly happen. It has been shown, for instance, that in infinity of  time the earth is sure to be hit by a comet; in the same way it may be  asserted that, if no time limit is fixed, the sun is certain to run  against some obstacle in space, either another star, or a dense meteor  swarm, or one of the dark bodies which there is every reason to  believe abound around us. The consequences of such a collision are  easy to foretell, provided that we know the masses and the velocities  of the colliding bodies. In a preceding chapter we have discussed the  motions of the sun and stars, and have seen that they are so swift  that an encounter between any two of them could not but be disastrous.  But this is not all; for as soon as two stars approached within a few  million miles their speed would be enormously increased by their  reciprocal attractions and, if their motion was directed radially with  respect to their centers, they would come together with a crash that  would reduce them both to nebulous clouds. It is true that the chances  of such a ``head-on'' collision are relatively very small; two stars  approaching each other would most probably fall into closed orbits  around their common center of gravity. If there were a collision it  would most likely be a grazing one instead of a direct front-to-front  encounter. But even a close approach, without any actual collision,  would probably prove disastrous, owing to the tidal influence of each  of the bodies on the other. Suns, in consequence of their enormous  masses and dimensions and the peculiarities of their constitution, are  exceedingly dangerous to one another at close quarters. Propinquity  awakes in them a mutually destructive tendency. Consisting of matter  in the gaseous, or perhaps, in some cases, liquid, state, their tidal  pull upon each other if brought close together might burst them  asunder, and the photospheric envelope being destroyed the internal  incandescent mass would gush out, bringing fiery death to any planets  that were revolving near. Without regard to the resulting disturbance  of the earth's orbit, the close approach of a great star to the sun  would be in the highest degree perilous to us. But this is a danger  which may properly be regarded as indefinitely remote, since, at our  present location in space, we are certainly far from every star except  the sun, and we may feel confident that no great invisible body is  near, for if there were one we should be aware of its presence from  the effects of its attraction. As to dark nebulae which may possibly  lie in the track that the solar system is pursuing at the rate of  375,000,000 miles per year, that is another question -- and they, too,  could be dangerous!    This brings us directly back to ``Nova Persei,'' for among the many  suggestions offered to explain its outburst, as well as those of other  temporary stars, one of the most fruitful is that of a collision  between a star and a vast invisible nebula. Professor Seeliger, of  Munich, first proposed this theory, but it afterward underwent some  modifications from others. Stated in a general form, the idea is that  a huge dark body, perhaps an extinguished sun, encountered in its  progress through space a widespread flock of small meteors forming a  dark nebula. As it plunged into the swarm the friction of the  innumerable collisions with the meteors heated its surface to  incandescence, and being of vast size it then became visible to us as  a new star. Meanwhile the motion of the body through the nebula, and  its rotation upon itself, set up a gyration in the blazing atmosphere  formed around it by the vaporized meteors; and as this atmosphere  spread wider, under the laws of gyratory motion a rotation in the  opposite direction began in the inflamed meteoric cloud outside the  central part of the vortex. Thus the spectral lines were caused to  show motion in opposite directions, a part of the incandescent mass  approaching the earth simultaneously with the retreat of another part.  So the curious spectroscopic observations before mentioned were  explained. This theory might also account for the appearance of the  nebulous spiral first seen some six months after the original  outburst. The sequent changes in the spectrum of the ``nova'' are  accounted for by this theory on the assumption, reasonable enough in  itself, that at first the invading body would be enveloped in a  vaporized atmosphere of relatively slight depth, producing by its  absorption the fine dark lines first observed; but that as time went  on and the incessant collisions continued, the blazing atmosphere  would become very deep and extensive, whereupon the appearance of the  spectral lines would change, and bright lines due to the light of the  incandescent meteors surrounding the nucleus at a great distance would  take the place of the original dark ones. The vortex of meteors once  formed would protect the flying body within from further immediate  collisions, the latter now occurring mainly among the meteors  themselves, and then the central blaze would die down, and the  "]]]
