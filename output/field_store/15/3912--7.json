You are knocking down all the balks  of my field!\" To which the king replied \"Who dares speak to me thus,\"  and sent men to fetch him. But he hid behind a clod, so that they could  not find him. And when he continued to abuse them without their finding  him, the king bade them take away the plough cattle to his house. And  the toad, followed secretly behind, and, hiding himself in the thatch  of the cowshed, began to abuse the king afresh. And the king searched  for him in vain; and at last ordered the cowshed to be pulled down and  the cattle to be put elsewhere. And the toad went and hid there, too,  and abused the king again. Finally, the king was frightened and called  to him: \"Oh! father, are you god or mortal? And what harm have I done  you?\" And he said \"I am mortal of a sooth. And I abuse you because you  have carried off my cattle. And if you do not give me your daughter  in marriage, I shall remain invisible and abuse you daily.\" So the  king swore that the toad should have his daughter, and the toad came  forth. And the king, for his oath's sake, and lest the toad should be  in some sort a god, gave him his daughter, and sent him home with a  sedan-chair and elephants and horses. And when he got near his home,  the old man and old woman ran clean away. But the toad, their adopted  son, seeing their terror, bade them not be afraid, and sent men after  them to fetch them. And then they sat down with their son-in-law and  daughter-in-law and feasted the men who had come with them. And one  day the girl, finding her husband very loathsome to look upon, told  him to take a bath. \"But,\" said her husband, \"what is the good of my  taking a bath? I am a frog and always bathing.\" But his wife replied  \"I know very well that you live in cold water. But I want to get rid  of those nasty protuberances on your back, and want to bathe you.\" So,  finally, her husband agreed. So she heated some water to boiling,  and called out \"Come quick, I must bathe you!\" And when the toad  came, and asked what he was to do, she said \"You jump straight in,  and I will bathe you afterwards.\" So he jumped in, and, turning over  on his back, died. And that's all!            THE STORY OF THE DOE AND THE RAVEN.    The doe and the raven were great friends, and lived together in the  shade of the same tree. And one day a jackal, seeing the doe, and  finding her to be fat and good to eat, said to her \"Oh friend, what  are you doing there? I am charmed to see you, and, if you permit,  would like to swear eternal friendship.\" But the doe said \"How can  there be friendship between the likes of us? we are sworn foes. If  you get hold of me, you will eat me. I am your food.\" But the jackal,  on hearing this, pretended to be mightily grieved, and said \"What  you observe is true enough, and that is just why all my family are  dead and I alone am left. And, considering these things, I, for my  part, am turned Hindu, eat no flesh, and have vowed friendship to all  animals. So you need be in no fear of me.\" To which the doe attached  implicit credence, and so they two walked together under the trees. But  the raven came up and said all he could to induce the doe to abandon  the fellowship of the jackal. But, as he could not prevail with her,  he told her the following story: \"Once upon a time there were two  friends. And they vowed that if ever they fell into danger, they  should on no account leave one another. And one day they were going  through the jungle together, when they met a bear. Now, one of them  could climb trees, and the other could not. And when the bear pursued  them, the one scrambled up into the first tree he met. But the other,  not knowing what else to do, lay on the ground, and, pretending to  be dead, held his breath. And the bear, coming and sniffing at him,  and finding him apparently dead, left him. Then his friend, shouting  to him from the tree, said \"What was it that the bear whispered  to you?\" And he replied \"The bear said to me 'never make friends  with men like that fellow in the tree.'\" \"And so,\" said the raven,  \"will it be with you and your friend the jackal.\" For all that, the  doe refused to listen, and after some days the jackal, when walking  out with the doe, spied a snare, and thrust her into it. And when she  bade him bite the cords and loose her, he reminded her of his vows and  of the fact that the cords were of hide. Then the raven, after long  searching, came up and found the doe in the toils, and set to work  to devise a remedy. And when the day was dawning he said to the doe  \"You swell out your belly, and hold your breath, and when I give the  word, run for your life.\" Presently, the owner of the snare came up,  spear in hand, and, seeing his quarry seemingly dead, loosed her  bonds. Upon which the raven cawed loudly, and the doe, jumping up,  ran for her life. But the hunter, seizing his spear, threw it after  her. And the spear missed the doe, and pierced the wicked jackal,  who died. And that's all!            THE OLD MAN AND THE TIGER.    There was once an old man, who, when he was cutting reeds for his  fence in the jungle, heard a tiger growling close to him; and it  happened that at that moment a bird also flew away. On which the old  man, though he was in truth very frightened, called after the bird  \"Ah! if you had only stopped, I would have taught you the secret  of the ghughu ban.\" And this saying he kept on repeating, so that  the tiger said to himself \"What is it that the old man is saying? I  must get him to tell me; and in that case I won't even eat him.\" So  he called to the old man. \"Look here, old man, what is that about  the ghughu ban?\" But the old man, answering not a word, kept on  chopping his reeds. Then the tiger crept up quite close to him,  and said to the old man \"If you don't tell me what you are talking  about, I will eat you!\" But the old man, for all his fear, only said  \"You come to my house tomorrow, and I will tell you.\" Very early  the next morning the tiger asked his way to the old man's house,  and when he got there, it being still early morning, the old man said  \"And what may your honour be pleased to want?\" And the tiger replied  \"I want to know what you were talking about yesterday.\" But the old  man replied \"I cannot possibly teach you alone. You had better go  and get two or three other tigers.\" And so the tiger went away and  returned with two or three of his brethren. In the meanwhile the  old man had spread his unthreshed paddy in the yard. And, putting  his earliest acquaintance first, he tied all the tigers to the post,  round which the cattle revolve when they are treading out the grain,  and set them to work to tread.    But the one in the middle, who was unaccustomed to such labour, cried  out in a piteous voice that his head ached, and that he was getting  very giddy. But the old man said \"Wait a bit, my friend; you haven't  learned yet.\" And when the tiger complained again, the old man fetched  his goad and pricked him sore, so that, giddy and stumbling, he had to  go round and round, and when the tiger said \"I shall die at this rate,\"  the old man replied \"You wanted to learn the ghughu ban yesterday,  and unless you endure this trouble, you cannot possibly learn;\" and,  so saying, pricked him the more cruelly. Finally, the tiger said  \"If so be, I must be in pain, I must be. But I don't see what it is  all about.\" Then the old man replied \"This is precisely what they  called the ghughu ban.\" Then the tiger said \"I see, I see, now let us  go. We have learned our lesson.\" But the old man said \"Wait a bit,  the paddy is nearly trodden out,\" and would not stop pricking the  tigers for all their entreaties. And when the paddy was all threshed,  the old man began untying their bonds. But before he had finished,  the tigers were in such pain that they tore the rope out of his hands  and ran away. When they stopped to rest, they saw the old man's rope,  and said to one another \"If we do not give the old man his rope again,  we shall get into further trouble.\" So, after much debate, the first  tiger was deputed to take it back.    So back he went, trembling with fear in every limb, and, getting close  to the old man's house, offered him his rope. But the old man said  \"It is night, and I am in bed. I can't come out. Put the rope in at  the window.\" So the tiger put it on his tail and thrust it in at the  window. But the old man had his knife ready and cut the tiger's tail  off. On which the tiger once more fled, howling with pain. But the old  man shouted after him \"You may run as far as you like, but my brother  is after you, and will catch you.\" On which the tiger ran faster than  ever. At last, however, he stopped to rest near a cool pool of water,  and, not seeing the old man's brother, dipped the wounded stump of  his tail into the pool for refreshment. But a crab, which dwelt in  that pool, nipped the stump of his tail; and the tiger crying \"The  old man's brother has caught me!\" again fled through the jungle,  and it was not till the crab was knocked off against the trees that  he at last rested. And that's all!            THE TALE OF THE MONKEY AND THE HARE.    A monkey and a hare were great friends. They lived together, ate  together, and walked about together. One day they saw a man from  Darrang going to a feast and bearing plantains and betel-nuts, and  they said to one another that they must contrive some plan to get  hold of his load. So the monkey sent the hare to wait on the road,  but himself hid in the jungle. And when the man came up and saw  the hare sitting on the road, he put down his load, and ran after  him. No sooner had he done so, than the monkey came and carried off  the plantains and betel-nuts into a tree, and, for fear the hare  should return, ate them all up in a great hurry, keeping only the  skins of the plantains for his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53526"],[0,"Cardinal Wolsey (#11)"],[1,"ais; the spot appointed for the  meeting was on the meadows between Guisnes and Ardres, on the borderland  of the two kingdoms. Wolsey had to decide which of the English nobles  and gentry were to attend the king, and had to assign to each his office  and dignity. The king's retinue amounted to nearly 4000, and the queen's  was somewhat over 1000. A very slight knowledge of human nature will  serve to show how many people Wolsey must necessarily have offended. If  the ranks of his enemies were large before, they must have increased  enormously when his arrangements were made known.    Still Wolsey was not daunted, and however much every one, from Francis  and Charles, felt aggrieved by his proceedings, all had to obey; and  everything that took place was due to Wolsey's will alone. The interview  with Charles was simple. On 26th May 1520 he landed at Dover, and was  met by Wolsey; next morning Henry rode to meet him and escort him to  Canterbury, which was his headquarters; on the 29th Charles rode to  Sandwich, where he embarked for Flanders. What subjects the two monarchs  discussed we can only dimly guess. Each promised to help the other if  attacked by France, and probably Henry undertook to bring about a  joint-conference of the three sovereigns to discuss their common  interests. The importance of the meeting lay in its display of  friendliness; in the warning which it gave to France that she was not to  count upon the exclusive possession of England's goodwill.    No sooner was the Emperor gone than Henry embarked for Calais, and  arrived at Guisnes on 4th June. We need not describe again the \"Field of  the Cloth of Gold,\" to furnish which the art of the Renaissance was used  to deck medi√¶val pageantry. It is enough to say that stately palaces of  wood clothed the barren stretch of flat meadows, and that every ornament  which man's imagination could devise was employed to lend splendour to  the scene. No doubt it was barbaric, wasteful, and foolish; but men in  those days loved the sight of magnificence, and the display was as much  for the enjoyment of countless spectators as for the self-glorification  of those who were the main actors. In those days the solace of a poor  man's life was the occasional enjoyment of a stately spectacle; and  after all, splendour gives more pleasure to the lookers-on than to the  personages of the show.    Most splendid among the glittering throng was the figure of Wolsey, who  had to support the dignity of representative of both kings, and spared  no pains to do it to the full. But while the jousts went on, Wolsey was  busy with diplomacy; there were many points relating to a good  understanding between France and England, which he wished to  arrange,--the projected marriage of the Dauphin with Mary of England,  the payment due from France to England on several heads, the relations  between France and Scotland and the like. More important than these was  the reconciliation of Charles with Francis, which Wolsey pressed to the  utmost of his persuasiveness, without, however, reaching any definite  conclusion. Charles was hovering on the Flemish border, ready at a hint  from Wolsey to join the conference; but Wolsey could find no good  reasons for giving it, and when the festivities came to an end on 24th  June, it might be doubted if much substantial good had resulted from the  interview. No doubt the French and English fraternised, and swore  friendship over their cups; but tournaments were not the happiest means  of allaying feelings of rivalry, and the protestations of friendship  were little more than lip-deep. Yet Wolsey cannot be blamed for being  over-sanguine. It was at least a worthy end that he had before him,--the  removal of long-standing hostility, the settlement of old disputes, the  union of two neighbouring nations by the assertion of common aims and  common interests. However we may condemn the methods which Wolsey used,  at least we must admit that his end was in accordance with the most  enlightened views of modern statesmanship.    When Henry had taken leave of Francis, he waited in Calais for the  coming of Charles, whose visit to England was understood to be merely  preliminary to further negotiations. Again Henry held the important  position; he went to meet Charles at Gravelines, where he stayed for a  night, and then escorted Charles as his guest to Calais, where he stayed  from 10th to 14th July. The result of the conference was a formal treaty  of alliance between the two sovereigns, which Charles proposed to  confirm by betrothing himself to Henry's daughter Mary. As she was a  child of four years old, such an undertaking did not bind him to much;  but Mary was already betrothed to the Dauphin, while Charles was also  already betrothed to Charlotte of France, so that the proposal aimed at  a double breach of existing relationships and treaties. Henry listened  to this scheme, which opened up the way for further negotiation, and the  two monarchs parted with protestations of friendship. It was now the  turn of Francis to hang about the place where Henry was holding  conference with his rival, in hopes that he too might be invited to  their discussions. He had to content himself with hearing that Henry  rode a steed which he had presented to him, and that his face did not  look so contented and cheerful as when he was on the meadows of Guisnes.  In due time he received from Henry an account of what had passed between  himself and the Emperor. Henry informed him of Charles's marriage  projects, and of his proposal for an alliance against France, both of  which Henry falsely said that he had rejected with holy horror.    Truly the records of diplomacy are dreary, and the results of all this  display, this ingenious scheming, and this deceit seem ludicrously  small. The upshot, however, was that Wolsey's ideas still remained  dominant, and that the position which he had marked out for England was  still maintained. He had been compelled to change the form of his  policy, but its essence was unchanged. European affairs could no longer  be directed by a universal peace under the guarantee of England; so  Wolsey substituted for it a system of separate alliances with England,  by which England exercised a mediating influence on the policy of the  two monarchs, whose rivalry threatened a breach of European peace. He  informed Francis of the schemes of Charles, that he might show him how  much depended on English mediation. He so conducted matters that Charles  and Francis should both be aware that England could make advantageous  terms with either, that her interests did not tend to one side rather  than the other, that both should be willing to secure her goodwill, and  should shrink from taking any step which would throw her on the side of  his adversary. It was a result worth achieving, though the position was  precarious, and required constant watchfulness to maintain.           CHAPTER V   THE CONFERENCE OF CALAIS   1520-1521      The most significant point in the mediatorial policy of Wolsey was the  fact that it threw the Papacy entirely into the shade. What Wolsey was  doing was the traditional business of the Pope, who could not openly  gainsay a policy which he was bound to profess coincided with his own.  So Leo X. followed Wolsey's lead of keeping on good terms with France  and the Emperor alike; but Leo had no real wish for peace. He wished to  gain something in Italy for the Medici, and nothing was to be gained  while France and Spain suspended hostilities. Only in time of war could  he hope to carry out his own plans by balancing one combatant against  the other. Charles's ambassador was not wrong in saying that Leo hated  Wolsey more than any other man; and Leo tried to upset his plans by  drawing nearer to the imperial side.    It required very little to provoke war between Francis and Charles;  either would begin the attack if the conditions were a little more  favourable, or if he could secure an ally. But Charles was weak owing to  the want of unity of interest in his unwieldy dominions. Germany was  disturbed by the opinions of Luther; Spain was disturbed by a revolt of  the cities against long-standing misgovernment. Charles was not ready  for war, nor was Francis much better provided. His coffers were empty  through his lavish expenditure, and his Government was not popular.  Really, though both wished for war, neither was prepared to be the  aggressor; both wanted the vantage of seeming to fight in self-defence.    It was obvious that Charles had made a high bid for the friendship of  England when he offered himself as the husband of the Princess Mary.  Wolsey had taken care that Francis was informed of this offer, which  necessarily led to a long negotiation with the imperial Court. Really  Charles's marriage projects were rather complicated; he was betrothed to  Charlotte of France; he had made an offer for Mary of England; but he  wished to marry Isabella of Portugal for no loftier reason than the  superior attractions of her dowry. His proposal for Mary of England was  prompted by nothing save the desire to have Henry as his ally against  France; if he could manage by fair promises to induce Henry to go to war  his purpose would be achieved, and he could still go in quest of the  Portuguese dower. So when Tunstal, the Master of the Rolls, went as  English envoy to discuss the matter, Charles's Council raised all sorts  of difficulties. Let the English king join a league with the Pope and  the Emperor against France; then the Pope would grant his dispensation,  which was necessary, owing to the relationship between Charles and Mary.  Tunstal was bidden by Wolsey to refuse such conditions. England would  not move until the marriage had been concluded, and would not join in  any league with the Pope till his dispensation was in Henry's hand. The  separate alliance of England and the Emperor must be put beyond doubt to  England's"]]]
