As a matter of fact the judgment  of difference is immediately formulated on the basis of the judgment as  to generic character. For 'the generic character' of a cow, e.g., means  just the exclusion of everything else: as soon as that character is  apprehended all thought and speech referring to other creatures  belonging to the same wider genus (which includes buffaloes and so on  also) come to an end. It is through the apprehension of difference only  that the idea of non-difference comes to an end.    [FOOTNOTE 44:1. Colour reveals itself as well as the thing that has  colour; knowledge reveals itself as well as the object known; so  difference manifests itself as well as the things that differ.]          Plurality is not unreal.    Next as to the assertion that all difference presented in our  cognition--as of jars, pieces of cloth and the like--is unreal because  such difference does not persist. This view, we maintain, is altogether  erroneous, springs in fact from the neglect of distinguishing between  persistence and non-persistence on the one hand, and the relation  between what sublates and what is sublated on the other hand. Where two  cognitions are mutually contradictory, there the latter relation holds  good, and there is non-persistence of what is sublated. But jars, pieces  of cloth and the like, do not contradict one another, since they are  separate in place and time. If on the other hand the non-existence of a  thing is cognised at the same time and the same place where and when its  existence is cognised, we have a mutual contradiction of two cognitions,  and then the stronger one sublates the other cognition which thus comes  to an end. But when of a thing that is perceived in connexion with some  place and time, the non-existence is perceived in connexion with some  other place and time, there arises no contradiction; how then should the  one cognition sublate the other? or how can it be said that of a thing  absent at one time and place there is absence at other times and places  also? In the case of the snake-rope, there arises a cognition of  non-existence in connexion with the given place and time; hence there is  contradiction, one judgment sublates the other and the sublated  cognition comes to an end. But the circumstance of something which is  seen at one time and in one place not persisting at another time and in  another place is not observed to be invariably accompanied by falsehood,  and hence mere non-persistence of this kind does not constitute a reason  for unreality. To say, on the other hand, that what is is real because  it persists, is to prove what is proved already, and requires no further  proof.          Being and consciousness are not one.    Hence mere Being does not alone constitute reality. And as the  distinction between consciousness and its objects--which rests just on  this relation of object and that for which the object is--is proved by  perception, the assertion that only consciousness has real existence is  also disposed of.          The true meaning of Svayamprak창satva.    We next take up the point as to the self-luminousness of consciousness  (above, p. 33). The contention that consciousness is not an object holds  good for the knowing Self at the time when it illumines (i.e.  constitutes as its objects) other things; but there is no absolute rule  as to all consciousness never being anything but self-luminous. For  common observation shows that the consciousness of one person may become  the object of the cognition of another, viz. of an inference founded on  the person's friendly or unfriendly appearance and the like, and again  that a person's own past states of consciousness become the object of  his own cognition--as appears from judgments such as 'At one time I knew.'  It cannot therefore be said 'If it is consciousness it is self-proved'  (above p. 33), nor that consciousness if becoming an object of  consciousness would no longer be consciousness; for from this it would  follow that one's own past states, and the conscious states of others--  because being objects of consciousness--are not themselves consciousness.  Moreover, unless it were admitted that there is inferential knowledge of  the thoughts of others, there would be no apprehension of the connexion  of words and meaning, and this would imply the absolute termination of  all human intercourse depending on speech. Nor also would it be possible  for pupils to attach themselves to a teacher of sacred lore, for the  reason that they had become aware of his wisdom and learning. The  general proposition that consciousness does not admit of being an object  is in fact quite untenable. The essential 'nature of consciousness or  knowledge--consists therein that it shines forth, or manifests itself,  through its own being to its own substrate at the present moment; or (to  give another definition) that it is instrumental in proving its own  object by its own being [FOOTNOTE 48:1].    Now these two characteristics are established by a person's own state of  consciousness and do not vanish when that consciousness becomes the  object of another state of consciousness; consciousness remains also in  the latter case what it is. Jars and similar things, on the other hand,  do not possess consciousness, not because they are objects of  consciousness but because they lack the two characteristics stated  above. If we made the presence of consciousness dependent on the absence  of its being an object of consciousness, we should arrive at the  conclusion that consciousness is not consciousness; for there are  things--e.g. sky-flowers--which are not objects of consciousness and at  the same time are not consciousness. You will perhaps reply to this that  a sky-flower's not being consciousness is due not to its not being an  object of consciousness, but to its non-existence!--Well then, we  rejoin, let us say analogously that the reason of jars and the like not  being contradictory to Nescience (i.e. of their being jada), is their  not being of the nature of consciousness, and let us not have recourse  to their being objects of consciousness!--But if consciousness is an  object of consciousness, we conclude that it also is non-contradictory  of Nescience, like a jar!--At this conclusion, we rejoin, you may arrive  even on the opposite assumption, reasoning as follows: 'Consciousness is  non-contradictory of Nescience, because it is not an object of  consciousness, like a sky-flower! All which shows that to maintain as a  general principle that something which is an object of consciousness  cannot itself be consciousness is simply ridiculous.'    [FOOTNOTE 48:1. The comment of the Sru. Pra. on the above definitions  runs, with a few additional explanations, as follows: The term  'anubh청ti' here denotes knowledge in general, not only such knowledge as  is not remembrance (which limited meaning the term has sometimes). With  reference to the 'shining forth' it might be said that in this way jars  also and similar things know or are conscious because they also shine  forth' (viz. in so far as they are known); to exclude jars and the like  the text therefore adds 'to its own substrate' (the jar 'shines forth,'  not to itself, but to the knowing person). There are other attributes  of the Self, such as atomic extension, eternity, and so on, which are  revealed (not through themselves) but through an act of knowledge  different from them; to exclude those the text adds 'through its own  being.' In order to exclude past states of consciousness or acts of  knowledge, the text adds 'at the present moment.' A past state of  consciousness is indeed not revealed without another act of knowledge  (representing it), and would thus by itself be excluded; but the text  adds this specification (viz. 'at the present moment') on purpose, in  order to intimate that a past state of consciousness can be represented  by another state--a point denied by the opponent. 'At the present  moment' means 'the connexion with the object of knowledge belonging to  the present time.' Without the addition of 'to its own substrate' the  definition might imply that a state of consciousness is manifest to  another person also; to exclude this the clause is added. This first  definition might be objected to as acceptable only to those who maintain  the svayamprak창satva-theory (which need not be discussed here); hence a  second definition is given. The two clauses 'to its own substrate' and  'at the present moment' have to be supplied in this second definition  also. 'Instrumental in bringing about' would apply to staffs, wheels,  and such like implements also; hence the text adds 'its own object.'  (Staffs, wheels, &c. have no 'objects.') Knowledge depending on sight  does not bring about an object depending on hearing; to exclude this  notion of universal instrumentality the text specifies the object by the  words 'its own.' The clause 'through its own being' excludes the sense  organs, which reveal objects not by their own being, but in so far as  they give rise to knowledge. The two clauses 'at the present moment' and  'to its own substrate' have the same office in the second definition as  in the first.]          Consciousness is not eternal.    It was further maintained by the p청rvapakshin that as consciousness is  self-established it has no antecedent non-existence and so on, and that  this disproves its having an origin. But this is an attempt to prove  something not proved by something else that is equally unproved;  comparable to a man blind from birth undertaking to guide another blind  man! You have no right to maintain the non-existence of the antecedent  non-existence of consciousness on the ground that there is nothing to  make us apprehend that non-existence; for there is something to make us  apprehend it, viz. consciousness itself!--But how can consciousness at  the time when it is, make us apprehend its own "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/73"],[0,"The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#11)"],[1,"the procession limped and staggered to this tune.    Another had the gray seal of death already upon his face.  His lips  were curled in hard lines and his teeth were clinched.  His hands were  bloody from where he had pressed them upon his wound.  He seemed to be  awaiting the moment when he should pitch headlong.  He stalked like the  specter of a soldier, his eyes burning with the power of a stare into  the unknown.    There were some who proceeded sullenly, full of anger at their wounds,  and ready to turn upon anything as an obscure cause.    An officer was carried along by two privates.  He was peevish.  \"Don't  joggle so, Johnson, yeh fool,\" he cried.  \"Think m' leg is made of  iron?  If yeh can't carry me decent, put me down an' let some one else  do it.\"    He bellowed at the tottering crowd who blocked the quick march of his  bearers.  \"Say, make way there, can't yeh?  Make way, dickens take it  all.\"    They sulkily parted and went to the roadsides.  As he was carried past  they made pert remarks to him.  When he raged in reply and threatened  them, they told him to be damned.    The shoulder of one of the tramping bearers knocked heavily against the  spectral soldier who was staring into the unknown.    The youth joined this crowd and marched along with it.  The torn bodies  expressed the awful machinery in which the men had been entangled.    Orderlies and couriers occasionally broke through the throng in the  roadway, scattering wounded men right and left, galloping on followed  by howls.  The melancholy march was continually disturbed by the  messengers, and sometimes by bustling batteries that came swinging and  thumping down upon them, the officers shouting orders to clear the way.    There was a tattered man, fouled with dust, blood and powder stain from  hair to shoes, who trudged quietly at the youth's side.  He was  listening with eagerness and much humility to the lurid descriptions of  a bearded sergeant.  His lean features wore an expression of awe and  admiration.  He was like a listener in a country store to wondrous  tales told among the sugar barrels.  He eyed the story-teller with  unspeakable wonder.  His mouth was agape in yokel fashion.    The sergeant, taking note of this, gave pause to his elaborate history  while he administered a sardonic comment.  \"Be keerful, honey, you 'll  be a-ketchin' flies,\" he said.    The tattered man shrank back abashed.    After a time he began to sidle near to the youth, and in a diffident  way try to make him a friend.  His voice was gentle as a girl's voice  and his eyes were pleading.  The youth saw with surprise that the  soldier had two wounds, one in the head, bound with a blood-soaked rag,  and the other in the arm, making that member dangle like a broken bough.    After they had walked together for some time the tattered man mustered  sufficient courage to speak.  \"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?\" he  timidly said.  The youth, deep in thought, glanced up at the bloody and  grim figure with its lamblike eyes.  \"What?\"    \"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said the youth shortly.  He quickened his pace.    But the other hobbled industriously after him.  There was an air of  apology in his manner, but he evidently thought that he needed only to  talk for a time, and the youth would perceive that he was a good fellow.    \"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?\" he began in a small voice, and the  he achieved the fortitude to continue.  \"Dern me if I ever see fellers  fight so.  Laws, how they did fight!  I knowed th' boys 'd like it when  they onct got square at it.  Th' boys ain't had no fair chanct up t'  now, but this time they showed what they was.  I knowed it 'd turn out  this way.  Yeh can't lick them boys.  No, sir!  They 're fighters, they  be.\"    He breathed a deep breath of humble admiration.  He had looked at the  youth for encouragement several times.  He received none, but gradually  he seemed to get absorbed in his subject.    \"I was talkin' 'cross pickets with a boy from Georgie, onct, an' that  boy, he ses, 'Your fellers 'll all run like hell when they onct hearn a  gun,' he ses.  'Mebbe they will,' I ses, 'but I don't b'lieve none of  it,' I ses; 'an' b'jiminey,' I ses back t' 'um, 'mebbe your fellers 'll  all run like hell when they onct hearn a gun,' I ses.  He larfed.  Well, they didn't run t' day, did they, hey?  No, sir!  They fit, an'  fit, an' fit.\"    His homely face was suffused with a light of love for the army which  was to him all things beautiful and powerful.    After a time he turned to the youth.  \"Where yeh hit, ol' boy?\" he  asked in a brotherly tone.    The youth felt instant panic at this question, although at first its  full import was not borne in upon him.    \"What?\" he asked.    \"Where yeh hit?\" repeated the tattered man.    \"Why,\" began the youth, \"I--I--that is--why--I--\"    He turned away suddenly and slid through the crowd.  His brow was  heavily flushed, and his fingers were picking nervously at one of his  buttons.  He bent his head and fastened his eyes studiously upon the  button as if it were a little problem.    The tattered man looked after him in astonishment.          Chapter 9      The youth fell back in the procession until the tattered soldier was  not in sight.  Then he started to walk on with the others.    But he was amid wounds.  The mob of men was bleeding.  Because of the  tattered soldier's question he now felt that his shame could be viewed.  He was continually casting sidelong glances to see if the men were  contemplating the letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.    At times he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way.  He  conceived persons with torn bodies to be peculiarly happy.  He wished  that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage.    The spectral soldier was at his side like a stalking reproach.  The  man's eyes were still fixed in a stare into the unknown.  His gray,  appalling face had attracted attention in the crowd, and men, slowing  to his dreary pace, were walking with him.  They were discussing his  plight, questioning him and giving him advice.  In a dogged way he  repelled them, signing to them to go on and leave him alone.  The  shadows of his face were deepening and his tight lips seemed holding in  check the moan of great despair.  There could be seen a certain  stiffness in the movements of his body, as if he were taking infinite  care not to arouse the passion of his wounds.  As he went on, he seemed  always looking for a place, like one who goes to choose a grave.    Something in the gesture of the man as he waved the bloody and pitying  soldiers away made the youth start as if bitten.  He yelled in horror.  Tottering forward he laid a quivering hand upon the man's arm.  As the  latter slowly turned his waxlike features toward him the youth screamed:    \"Gawd!  Jim Conklin!\"    The tall soldier made a little commonplace smile.  \"Hello, Henry,\" he  said.    The youth swayed on his legs and glared strangely.  He stuttered and  stammered.  \"Oh, Jim--oh, Jim--oh, Jim--\"    The tall soldier held out his gory hand.  There was a curious red and  black combination of new blood and old blood upon it.  \"Where yeh been,  Henry?\" he asked.  He continued in a monotonous voice, \"I thought mebbe  yeh got keeled over.  There 's been thunder t' pay t'-day.  I was  worryin' about it a good deal.\"    The youth still lamented.  \"Oh, Jim--oh, Jim--oh, Jim--\"    \"Yeh know,\" said the tall soldier, \"I was out there.\"  He made a  careful gesture.  \"An', Lord, what a circus!  An', b'jiminey, I got  shot--I got shot.  Yes, b'jiminey, I got shot.\"  He reiterated this  fact in a bewildered way, as if he did not know how it came about.    The youth put forth anxious arms to assist him, but the tall soldier  went firmly as if propelled.  Since the youth's arrival as a guardian  for his friend, the other wounded men had ceased to display much  interest.  They occupied themselves again in dragging their own  tragedies toward the rear.    Suddenly, as the two friends marched on, the tall soldier seemed to be  overcome by a tremor.  His face turned to a semblance of gray paste.  He clutched the youth's arm and looked all about him, as if dreading to  be overheard.  Then he began to speak in a shaking whisper:    \"I tell yeh what I'm 'fraid of, Henry--I'll tell yeh what I'm 'fraid  of.  I 'm 'fraid I 'll fall down--an' them yeh know--them damned  artillery wagons--they like as not 'll run over me.  That 's what I 'm  'fraid of--\"    The youth cried out to him hysterically:  \"I 'll take care of yeh, Jim!  I 'll take care of yeh!  I swear t' Gawd I will!\"    \"Sure--will yeh, Henry?\" the tall soldier beseeched.    \"Yes--yes--I tell yeh--I'll take care of yeh, Jim!\" protested the  youth.  He could not speak accurately because of the gulpings in his  throat.    But the tall soldier continued to beg in a lowly way.  He now hung  babelike to the youth's arm.  His eyes rolled in the wildness of his  terror.  \"I was allus a good friend t' yeh, wa'n't I, Henry?  I 've  allus been a pretty good feller, ain't I?  An' it ain't much t' ask, is  it?  Jest t' pull me along outer th' road?  I'd do it fer you, wouldn't  I, Henry?\"    He paused in piteous anxiety to await his friend's reply.    The youth had reached an anguish where the sobs scorched him.  He  strove to express his loyalty, but he could only make fantastic  gestures.    However, the tall soldier seemed suddenly to forget all those fears.  He became again the grim, stalking specter of a soldier.  He went  stonily forward.  The youth wished his friend to lean upon him, but the  other always shook his head and strangely protested.  \"No--no--no--leave me be--leave me be--\"    His look was fixed again upon the unknown.  He moved with mysterious  purpose, and all of the youth's offers he brushed aside.  \"No--no--leave me be--leave me be--\"    The youth had to follow.    Presently the latter heard a voice talking "]]]
