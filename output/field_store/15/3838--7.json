Williams,  who accompanied us from Kirtland, now assembled in Independence,  Jackson County, Missouri, and came to the conclusion that one of  our number had better return to the church in Ohio, and perhaps to  headquarters in New York, in order to communicate with the  Presidency, report ourselves, pay a visit to the numerous churches  we had organized on our outward journey, and also to procure more  books.    For this laborious enterprise I was selected by the voice of my  four brethren. I accordingly took leave of them, and of our friends  in that country, and started on foot.    In nine days I arrived at St. Louis, distance three hundred  miles. It was now the latter part of February; the snow had  disappeared, the rivers were breaking up, and the whole country  inundated as it were with mud and water. I spent a few days with a  friend in the country, at the same place we had tarried on the way  out; and then took a steamer in St. Louis bound for Cincinnati,  where I landed in safety after a passage of one week. From  Cincinnati I travelled on foot to Strongville, Ohio, forty miles  from Kirtland.    This last walk consisted of some two hundred and fifty miles,  over very bad, muddy road; and for some days I had found myself  much fatigued, and quite out of health. Hearing of some brethren in  Strongville, I determined to inquire them out, and try their  hospitality to a sick and weary stranger without making myself  known.    I accordingly approached the house of an old gentleman by the  name of Coltrin, about sundown, and inquired if they could  entertain a weary stranger who had no money. The old gentleman cast  his eyes upon me, and beheld a weary, weather-beaten traveller;  soiled with the toil of a long journey; besmeared with mud, eyes  inflamed with pain, long heard, and a visage lengthened by sickness  and extreme fatigue. After a moment's hesitation he bade me  welcome, and invited me into his house. Several ladies were at tea.  I addressed them as a stranger who had come to partake of their  hospitality for the night.    They received me with a smile of welcome, and immediately  insisted on my sitting down to tea, during which something like the  following conversation took place:    \"Stranger, where are you from? You certainly look weary; you  must have travelled a long distance!\"    \"Yes; I am from beyond the frontiers of Missouri; a distance of  twelve hundred miles.\" \"Ah, indeed! Did you hear anything of the  four great prophets out that way?\"    \"Prophets! What prophets?\"    \"Why, four men--strange men--who came through this country and  preached, and baptized hundreds of people; and, after ordaining  Elders and organizing churches, they continued on westward, as we  suppose, to the frontiers on a mission to the Indians; and we have  never heard from them since. But the great work commenced by them  still rolls on. It commenced last fall in Kirtland, and has spread  for a hundred miles around; thousands have embraced it, and among  others ourselves and many in this neighborhood.\"    \"But what did they preach? And why do you call them prophets?\"    \"Why they opened the Scriptures in a wonderful manner; showed  the people plainly of many things to come; opened the doctrine of  Christ, as we never understood it before; and, among other things,  they introduced a very extraordinary Book, which, they said, was an  ancient record of the forefathers of the Indian tribes.\"    \"How were they dressed, and in what style did they travel?\"    \"They were dressed plainly and comely, very neat in their  persons, and each one wore a hat of a drab color, low round crown  and broad brim, after the manner of the Shakers, so it is said; for  we had not the privilege of seeing them ourselves.    \"However, these fashioned hats were not a peculiarity of this  people; but were given to each of them by the Shakers, at the time  they passed through this country; so they wore them. As to their  style of travelling, they sometimes go on foot, sometimes in a  carriage, and sometimes, perhaps, by water; but they provide  themselves with neither purse nor scrip for their journey, neither  shoes nor two coats apiece.\"    \"Well, from your description of these four men I think I have  seen them on the frontiers of Missouri. They had commenced a  mission in the Indian territory; but were compelled by the United  States agents, influenced, no doubt, by missionaries, to depart  from the Indian country, although well received by the Indians  themselves.\"    \"You saw them, then?\"    \"I did.\"    \"Were they well?\"    \"I believe they were all in good health and spirits.\"    \"Will they return soon? O, who would not give the world to see  them!\"    \"Well, I am one of them, and the others you may, perhaps, see.\"    \"You one of them! God bless you. What is your name?\"    \"My name is Parley P. Pratt, one of the four men you have  described, but not much of a prophet; and as to a sight of me in my  present plight, I think it would not be worth half a world.\"    The rest of the conversation I cannot write, for all spoke, all  laughed, and all rejoiced at once.    The next morning I found myself unable to rise from my bed,  being severely attacked with the measles.    I came near dying, and was confined for one or two weeks among  them, being scarcely able to raise my head. I was watched over  night and day, and had all the care that a man could have in his  father's house.    As I recovered in part, being still very weak, I was provided  with a horse, on which I arrived at Kirtland.    Hundreds of the saints now crowded around to welcome me, and to  inquire after my brethren whom I had left in Missouri.    Here also I again met President Joseph Smith, who had, during  our absence, come up from the State of New York.    I found the churches in Ohio had increased to more than a  thousand members, and those in New York to several hundred.    I also heard from my wife, from whom I had been absent about six  months. The news was that the whole Church in the State of New  York, including herself (for she had joined during my absence), was  about to remove to Ohio in the opening spring. I, therefore, was  advised to proceed no farther eastward, but to await their arrival.  After visiting the saints a few days, I commenced to labor with my  hands; but the Lord would not suffer me to continue long in this  occupation.    Some time in March, I was commanded of the Lord, in connection  with S. Rigdon and L. Copley, to visit a people called the  Shakers;* and preach the gospel unto them.    [Footnote] *See Book of Doctrine and Covenants, section 65.    We fulfilled this mission, as we were commanded, in a settlement  of this strange people, near Cleveland, Ohio; but they utterly  refused to hear or obey the gospel. After this I paid a visit to  the churches round about Kirtland.    As I went forth among the different branches, some very strange  spiritual operations were manifested, which were disgusting,  rather than edifying. Some persons would seem to swoon away,  and make unseemly gestures, and be drawn or disfigured in their  countenances. Others would fall into ecstacies, and be drawn into  contortions, cramp, fits, etc. Others would seem to have visions  and revelations, which were not edifying, and which were not  congenial to the doctrine and spirit of the gospel. In short, a  false and lying spirit seemed to be creeping into the Church.    All these things were new and strange to me, and had originated  in the Church during our absence, and previous to the arrival of  President Joseph Smith from New York.    Feeling our weakness and inexperience, and lest we should err in  judgment concerning these spiritual phenomena, myself, John  Murdock, and several other Elders, went to Joseph Smith, and asked  him to inquire of the Lord concerning these spirits or manifestations.    After we had joined in prayer in his translating room, he  dictated in our presence the following revelation:--(Each sentence  was uttered slowly and very distinctly, and with a pause between  each, sufficiently long for it to be recorded, by an ordinary  writer, in long hand.    This was the manner in which all his written revelations were  dictated and written. There was never any hesitation, reviewing, or  reading back, in order to keep the run of the subject; neither did  any of these communications undergo revisions, interlinings, or  corrections. As he dictated them so they stood, so far as I have  witnessed; and I was present to witness the dictation of several  communications of several pages each.    This inquiry was made and the answer given in May, 1831.)

Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many spirits  which are false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth,  deceiving the world; and also Satan hath sought to deceive you,  that he might overthrow you.    \"Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and have seen  abominations in the Church that possess my name; but blessed are  they who are faithful and endure, whether in life or in death; for  they shall inherit eternal life.

A  woman of 27 years (usually claiming to be 17), during a career of  7 or 8 years has engaged in an excessive amount of  misrepresentation, often to the extent of swindling.  Alleging  herself to be merely a girl and without a family, she has  repeatedly gained protection, sometimes for a year or more, in  homes where her prevaricating tendencies, appearing with ever new  details, have sooner or later thwarted her own interests.  By  extraordinary methods she has often simulated illnesses which  have demanded hospital treatment.  For long she was lost to her  family, traveling about under different names, making her way by  her remarkable abilities and unusual presence.      This case illustrates, again, two points we have often made,  namely, that the difficulty of getting safe data concerning  genetics increases rapidly with age, and that the chance of  altering tendencies after years of character formation vastly  diminishes.  These features appear strongly here, yet our long  knowledge of the person and of the many details of her career  gives the history great interest.    A young woman, whom we will call Inez B., a name she once assumed  for a time, arrived at a girls' boarding home in Chicago with  merely a small traveling bag and money sufficient only for a few  days.  In appearance and conversation she gave distinct evidences  of refinement.  She showed indecision and confessed she knew no  one in the city.    Just at this time a wealthy eastern girl, Agnes W., was missing  from her home, and the police everywhere were on the lookout for  her.  A detective who was ordered to visit the boarding club  showed a picture of Agnes W. to the matron, who instantly  discerned a likeness to Inez and informed him of her recent  arrival.  Inez was questioned, but could or would give no  satisfactory response concerning her own home.  She maintained  she was just 17 and had come to Chicago to make her own way in  the world.  After some account of herself, the details of which  were somewhat contradictory, it was inferred that she might be  Agnes W.  She vehemently denied it, but being the same age and  some likeness being discerned, the questioning was continued.  Various matters of Agnes W.'s antecedents were gone into and  after a time Inez burst out with, ``Well, if you must have it so,  I am Agnes W.''  The girl was thereupon taken in charge by the  police authorities, and she herself registered several times as  Agnes W.  After the family of the latter had been communicated  with, however, it was ascertained that Inez was not the lost  heiress.    She now said that anyhow she really was a runaway girl.  She had  left her adopted parents because they were cruel and immoral.  It  was her unhappy brooding over her own affairs that led her to lie  about being the other girl.  She insisted she was sorry for the  many lies she had told various officers, but felt, after all,  they were to blame because their obvious desire to have her tell  that she was Agnes W. led her on.  They deceived her first  because they misrepresented themselves and did not say they were  police officials.  Nevertheless, she makes much of how she hates  her false position, being registered under a false name and  figuring as a deceiver.    The significant points in the long story of Inez, as told to us  in the days of our first acquaintance with her, are worth giving.  (At this period she was with us thoroughly consistent; at all  times she has appeared self-possessed and coherent.)  Inez states  she is 17 and has just come from a town in Tennessee where she  has been living for a couple of years with some people by the  name of B. who adopted her.  At first they were very good to her  and she loved them dearly.  She was quite unsophisticated when  she went to them and did not realize then that they were not good  people.  She met them at an employment agency in St. Louis where  she had gone after leaving the Smiths, the people who had brought  her up.  At that time the B.'s appeared fairly well-to-do, but  Mr. B. had been running up debts that later carried him into  bankruptcy.  Inez was sick and exhausted now from having worked  so hard for them.  She finally ran away from that town because  the B.'s wanted to go elsewhere, leaving her in a compromising  position with a young man who rented their house.  She first  tried boarding in two places, however, before she ventured to go.    The Smiths were the people she lived with until she was 14.  She  remembers first living with them, but faintly recalls bearing the  name of Mary Johnson before that.  Who the Johnsons were she does  not know, but she feels sure of the fact that she was born in New  Orleans.  However, Inez does not worry about her parentage even  though it is unknown.  Mrs. Smith was an elderly woman of wealth  who was very good to her, and by the time she was 14 she had  studied German and French, algebra and trigonometry.  She had a  French tutor and took lessons on the piano.  Always did well in  school and loved her work there.  The Smith children, who were  much older, were very angry with their mother for all the money  she spent on Inez--they would have preferred its being expended  on their children.  The son grew quite abusive and Mrs. S. was  made to suffer so much that the girl came to feel that she was  largely the cause of the old lady's unhappiness.  After one  particularly deplorable scene she slipped away from their home in  New Orleans, traveled to St. Louis and went to an employment  agency where she found the B.'s.  At the present time, above all  things, she does not want the Smiths to know about her when she  is temporarily a failure.  She will never go back to them until  she can help the old lady who was so good to her.    Inez tells us she is now suffering from a wound still open as the  result of an operation for appendicitis performed two years  previously.  She also suffered from tuberculosis a few years ago.  (She was found to be running a slight temperature, and some  slight hemorrhages in the sputum were observed.)    It may strengthen the portraiture so far sketched to give our  impressions as stated after our first study covering a week or  two; nor will it lessen the reader's interest to remark that it  was not for lack of acquaintance with the pathological liar type  that we failed to correctly size up this individual.  Indeed, we  had already studied nearly all the other cases cited in this  monograph.  Our statement ran as follows:  ``This girl is very  frank and talkative with us.  With her strong, but refined  features and cultivated voice she is a good deal of a  personality.  She is sanguine and independent.  Very likely she  does not exaggerate the hard times she has had in going from one  home to another.  One cannot but respect this unusual young woman  for wanting to keep her early history secret.  It would be  fortunate if some one would care for the girl and get her  ailments cured.  With her very good ability she might easily then  be self-supporting.''    A woman of strength and judgment undertook to look after Inez.  The girl's personality commanded interest.  In a few days she  complained more vigorously of her abdominal trouble; an operation  seemed imperative and was performed.  (An account of this will be  given later.)  Later the girl was taken to a convalescent home  and then to a beautiful lake resort.  While here she suddenly was  stricken desperately ill.  Her friend was telegraphed for, a  special boat was commissioned, and the girl was taken to a  neighboring sanitarium.  The doctors readily agreed that the case  was one of simulation or hysteria.  She was brought back to  Chicago and warned that this sort of performance would not pay.  After being given further opportunity to rest, although under  less favorable circumstances, in a few weeks she was offered work  in several homes, but in each instance the connection was soon  severed.  Then without letting her guardian-friend know, Inez  suddenly left the city.    Inquiries had brought by this time responses telling something of  the career of Inez in the past two years, but nothing earlier.  She was the ``mystery girl'' in the Tennessee town, as she was in  Chicago.  The B.'s kept a boarding-house and took Inez as a  waitress, knowing her first by still another alias.  She worked  for them about a year and then went to Memphis, where she was  sick in a hospital.  She had now taken the B.'s name.  They were  regarded as her guardians (on the girl's authority) and they  finally sent for her again out of pity, although they felt she  had a questionable past, and they knew she had lied tremendously  while with them.  Then the B.'s moved away and turned Inez over  to a respectable family.  While with the B.'s Inez had been  regarded as a partial invalid; their physician diagnosed the case  as diabetes and found it incurable.  In fact, the B.'s went into  debt for her prolonged treatment.  Another physician, who was  called in after the B.'s left, said the trouble was Bright's  disease.  At any rate, all regarded her as suffering from some  chronic disorder.  Except for her extraordinary lying, of which  she made exhibitions to many, and some little tendencies to  dishonesty mixed with her lying, Inez was regarded as being quite  normal.  The two other families with whom she lived for a time  found it impossible to tolerate the girl on account of her lying.  Finally, obtaining money by false representation, telling the  story of a rich uncle in Chicago to whom she was going, Inez  departed, taking with her a trunk containing valuables belonging  to the B.'s.
