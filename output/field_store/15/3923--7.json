Oxford had veneered him, but scratch the  veneer and one found the sandal-wood of the East, perfumed, seductive,  appealing, but something to be shunned as brittle and untrustworthy.    Yet he hesitated, seeking to be true to his convictions. Knowing what he  knew already, and what he suspected, it is certain that, could he have  viewed Lou Chada through the eyes of Chief Inspector Kerry, the affair  must have terminated otherwise. But Sir Noel did not know what Kerry  knew. And the pleasure-seeking Lady Rourke, with her hair of spun gold  and her provoking smile, found Lou Chada dangerously fascinating; almost  she was infatuated--she who had known so much admiration.    Of those joys for which thousands of her plainer sisters yearn and  starve to the end of their days she had experienced a surfeit. Always  she sought for novelty, for new adventures. She was confident of  herself, but yet--and here lay the delicious thrill--not wholly  confident. Many times she had promised to visit the house of Lou Chada's  father--a mystery palace cunningly painted, a perfumed page from the  Arabian poets dropped amid the interesting squalor of Limehouse.    Perhaps she had never intended to go. Who knows? But on the night when  she came within the ken of Chief Inspector Kerry, Lou Chada had urged  her to do so in his poetically passionate fashion, and, wanting to go,  she had asked herself: \"Am I strong enough? Dare I?\"    They had dined, danced, and she had smoked one of the scented cigarettes  which he alone seemed to be able to procure, and which, on their arrival  from the East, were contained in queer little polished wooden boxes.    Then had come an unfamiliar nausea and dizziness, an uncomfortable  recognition of the fact that she was making a fool of herself, and  finally a semi-darkness through which familiar faces loomed up and  were quickly lost again. There was the soft, musical voice of Lou Chada  reassuring her, a sense of chill, of helplessness, and then for a while  an interval which afterward she found herself unable to bridge.    Knowledge of verity came at last, and Lady Pat raised herself from the  divan upon which she had been lying, and, her slender hands clutching  the cushions, stared about her with eyes which ever grew wider.    She was in a long, rather lofty room, which was lighted by three silver  lanterns swung from the ceiling. The place, without containing much  furniture, was a riot of garish, barbaric colour. There were deep divans  cushioned in amber and blood-red. Upon the floor lay Persian carpets  and skins of beasts. Cunning niches there were, half concealing and half  revealing long-necked Chinese jars; and odd little carven tables bore  strangely fashioned vessels of silver. There was a cabinet of ebony  inlaid with jade, there were black tapestries figured with dragons of  green and gold. Curtains she saw of peacock-blue; and in a tall, narrow  recess, dominating the room, squatted a great golden Buddha.    The atmosphere was laden with a strange perfume.    But, above all, this room was silent, most oppressively silent.    Lady Pat started to her feet. The whole perfumed place seemed to be  swimming around her. Reclosing her eyes, she fought down her weakness.  The truth, the truth respecting Lou Chada and herself, had uprisen  starkly before her. By her own folly--and she could find no  tiny excuse--she had placed herself in the power of a man whom,  instinctively, deep within her soul, she had always known to be utterly  unscrupulous.    How cleverly he had concealed the wild animal which dwelt beneath  that suave, polished exterior! Yet how ill he had concealed it! For  intuitively she had always recognized its presence, but had deliberately  closed her eyes, finding a joy in the secret knowledge of danger. Now at  last he had discarded pretense.    The cigarette which he had offered her at the club had been drugged. She  was in Limehouse, at the mercy of a man in whose veins ran the blood of  ancestors to whom women had been chattels. Too well she recognized that  his passion must have driven him insane, as he must know at what cost  he took such liberties with one who could not lightly be so treated. But  these reflections afforded poor consolation. It was not of the penalties  that Lou Chada must suffer for this infringement of Western codes, but  of the price that she must pay for her folly, of which Pat was thinking.    There was a nauseating taste upon her palate. She remembered having  noticed it faintly while she was smoking the cigarette; indeed, she had  commented upon it at the time.    \"The dirty yellow blackguard!\" she said aloud, and clenched her hands.    She merely echoed what many a man had said before her. She wondered at  herself, and in doing so but wondered at the mystery of womanhood.    Clarity was returning. The room no longer swam around her. She crossed  in the direction of a garish curtain, which instinctively she divined to  mask a door. Dragging it aside, she tried the handle, but the door was  locked. A second door she found, and this also proved to be locked.    There was one tall window, also covered by ornate draperies, but it  was shuttered, and the shutters had locks. Another small window she  discovered, glazed with amber glass, but set so high in the wall as to  be inaccessible.    Dread assailed her, and dropping on to one of the divans, she hid her  face in her hands.    \"My God!\" she whispered. \"My God! Give me strength--give me courage.\"    For a long time she remained there, listening for any sound which should  disperse the silence. She thought of her husband, of the sweet security  of her home, of the things which she had forfeited because of this mad  quest of adventure. And presently a key grated in a lock.    Lady Pat started to her feet with a wild, swift action which must have  reminded a beholder of a startled gazelle. The drapery masking the door  which she had first investigated was drawn aside. A man entered and  dropped the curtain behind him.    Exactly what she had expected she could not have defined, but the  presence of this perfect stranger was a complete surprise. The man,  who wore embroidered slippers and a sort of long blue robe, stood there  regarding her with an expression which, even in her frantic condition,  she found to be puzzling. He had long, untidy gray hair brushed back  from his low brow; eyes strangely like the eyes of Lou Chada, except  that they were more heavy-lidded; but his skin was as yellow as a  guinea, and his gaunt, cleanshaven face was the face of an Oriental.    The slender hands, too, which he held clasped before him, were yellow,  and possessed a curiously arresting quality. Pat imagined them clasped  about her white throat, and her very soul seemed to shrink from the man  who stood there looking at her with those long, magnetic, inscrutable  eyes.    She wondered why she was surprised, and suddenly realized that it was  because of the expression in his eyes, for it was an expression of cold  anger. Then the intruder spoke.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded, speaking with an accent which was unfamiliar  to her, but in a voice which was not unlike the voice of Lou Chada. \"Who  brought you here?\"    This was so wholly unexpected that for a moment she found herself unable  to reply, but finally:    \"How dare you!\" she cried, her native courage reasserting itself. \"I  have been drugged and brought to this place. You shall pay for it. How  dare you!\"    \"Ah!\" The long, dark eyes regarded her unmovingly. \"But who are you?\"    \"I am Lady Rourke. Open the door. You shall bitterly regret this  outrage.\"    \"You are Lady Rourke?\" the man repeated. \"Before you speak of regrets,  answer the question which I have asked: Who brought you here?\"    \"Lou Chada.\"    \"Ah!\" There was no alteration of pose, no change of expression, but  slightly the intonation had varied.    \"I don't know who you are, but I demand to be released from this place  instantly.\"    The man standing before the curtained door slightly inclined his head.    \"You shall be released,\" he replied, \"but not instantly. I will see the  one who brought you here. He may not be entirely to blame. Before you  leave we shall understand one another.\"    Tone and glance were coldly angry. Then, before the frightened woman  could say another word, the man in the blue robe robe withdrew, the  curtain was dropped again, and she heard the grating of a key in the  lock. She ran to the door, beating upon it with her clenched hands.    \"Let me go!\" she cried, half hysterically. \"Let me go! You shall pay for  this! Oh, you shall pay for this!\"    No one answered, and, turning, she leaned back against the curtain,  breathing heavily and fighting for composure, for strength.          IV    ZANI CHADA, THE EURASIAN        \"I can't help thinking, Chief Inspector,\" said the officer in charge at  Limehouse Station, \"that you take unnecessary risks.\"    \"Can't you?\" said Kerry, tilting his bowler farther forward and staring  truculently at the speaker.    \"No, I can't. Since you cleaned up the dope gang down here you've been  a marked man. These murders in the Chinatown area, of which this one  to-night makes the third, have got some kind of big influence behind  them. Yet you wander about in the fog without even a gun in your  pocket.\"    \"I don't believe in guns,\" rapped Kerry. \"My bare hands are good enough  for any yellow smart in this area. And if they give out I can kick like  a mule.\"    The other laughed, shaking his head.    \"It's silly, all the same,\" he persisted. \"The man who did the job out  there in the fog to-night might have knifed you or shot you long before  you could have got here.\"    \"He might,\" snapped Kerry, \"but he didn't.\"    Yet, remembering his wife, who would be waiting for him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/571"],[0,"The 1995 CIA World Factbook (#11)"],[1,"  agriculture/fishing/forestry/mining 4%    @Anguilla:Government     Names:   conventional long form: none   conventional short form: Anguilla     Digraph: AV     Type: dependent territory of the UK     Capital: The Valley     Administrative divisions: none (dependent territory of the UK)     Independence: none (dependent territory of the UK)     National holiday: Anguilla Day, 30 May     Constitution: Anguilla Constitutional Orders 1 April 1982; amended   1990     Legal system: based on English common law     Suffrage: 18 years of age; universal     Executive branch:   chief of state: Queen ELIZABETH II (since 6 February 1952),   represented by Governor Alan W.

Administration is carried   out through consultative member meetings - the 18th Antarctic Treaty   Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. Currently, there are   42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.   Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim   portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and   19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made   no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize   the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an   acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while   no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.   Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New   Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are -   Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989),   Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),   Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain   (1988), "]]]
