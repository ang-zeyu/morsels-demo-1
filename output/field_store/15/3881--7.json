He could climb the rope with any of them, could vault  on to the wooden horse with a heavy cuirass and backpiece on him, and  held his own in a bout with swords against Conrad von Berghoff, who was  considered the best swordplayer among them. As soon as the exercises  were over all proceeded to the bath, and then to dinner. The meal was a  simple one, but Gervaise enjoyed it thoroughly, for the table was loaded  with an abundance of fruits of kinds altogether novel to him, and which  he found delicious.    The official in charge of them sat at the head of the table, and the  meal was eaten in silence. After it was over and they had retired to  their own rooms discipline was at an end, and they were free to amuse  themselves as they liked. There were many questions to be asked and  answered, but his display of strength and skill in the courtyard saved  Gervaise from a good deal of the teasing to which a newcomer among a  party of boys is always exposed.    He, on his part, learnt that the duties of the pages were very light.  Two only were on duty each day, being in constant attendance on the  grand master, and accompanying him wherever he went. When he dined in  public four of them waited on him at table, and one of them performed  the duties of taster. If he returned to the palace after dark, six  others lined the staircase with torches. On occasions of state ceremony,  and at the numerous religious festivals, all were in attendance. By this  time Gervaise's trunks had been brought over from the English auberge,  where they had been conveyed from the ship, and his garments were taken  out and inspected by his comrades, who all admitted that they were, in  point of beauty of colour and material, and in fashion, equal to their  own.    \"You will have to get one more suit, Gervaise,\" one of the lads said.  \"At one or two of the grand ceremonies every year we are all dressed  alike; that is the rule. On other occasions we wear what we choose, so  that our garments are handsome, and I think it looks a good deal better  than when we are dressed alike; though no doubt in religious processions  that is more appropriate. De Ribaumont, our governor, will give orders  for the supply of your state costume. He is a good fellow. Of course,  he has to be rather strict with us; but so long as there is nothing done  that he considers discreditable to our position, he lets us do pretty  nearly as we like.    \"We have four hours a day at our military exercises, and two hours with  the sub-chaplain, who teaches us our books and religious duties. The  rest of our time we can use as we like, except that every day eight of  us ride for two hours and practise with the lance; for although it is at  sea we fight the Moslems, we are expected to become finished knights in  all matters. These eight horses are kept for our service, and such as  choose may at other times ride them. On Saturdays we are free from  all our exercises; then some of us generally go on horseback for long  excursions on the island, while others take boats and go out on the sea;  one afternoon in the week we all make a trip in a galley, to learn our  duties on board.\"        CHAPTER IV A PROFESSED KNIGHT      Gervaise was soon quite at home in the palace of the grand master, and  his companions were, like other boys, of varying characters; but as all  were of noble families, were strongly impressed with the importance of  the Order and the honour of their own position, and were constantly  in contact with stately knights and grave officials, their manners  conformed to those of their elders; and even among themselves there was  no rough fun, or loud disputes, but a certain courtesy of manner that  was in accordance with their surroundings. This came naturally to  Gervaise, brought up as he had been by his father and mother, and having  at frequent intervals stayed with them for months at the various  royal castles in which Margaret of Anjou and her son had been assigned  apartments during their exile. Even at St. John's house the novices  with whom he lived were all a good deal older than himself, and the  discipline of the house was much more strict than that at Rhodes.    He enjoyed both his exercises with the knights and the time spent  with the sub-chaplain, no small proportion of the hours of study being  occupied in listening to stories of chivalry; it being considered one of  the most important parts of a knight's education that he should have a  thorough acquaintance, not only with the laws of chivalry, but with the  brave deeds both of former and of living knights, with the relations of  the noble houses of Europe to each other, especially of the many great  families whose members were connected with the Order of St. John.    These matters formed, indeed, the main subject of their studies. All  were taught to read and write, but this was considered sufficient in the  way of actual instruction. The rules of the Order had to be committed  to memory. Beyond this their reading consisted largely of the lives  of saints, especially of those who distinguished themselves by their  charity or their devotion to their vows of poverty, to both of which the  members of the Order were pledged. Gervaise, however, could see around  him no signs whatever of poverty on their part. It was true that they  all lived and fed together in the auberges of their respective langues,  and that they possessed no houses or establishments of their own; but  the magnificence of their armour and attire, and the lavish expenditure  of some upon their pleasures, contrasted strangely with the poverty  to which they had vowed themselves. It was true that in many cases the  means to support the expenditure was derived from the shares the knights  received of the plunder acquired in their captures of Moslem ships; but  undoubtedly many must have possessed large private means; the bailiffs,  for example, although only required by the rules to place before the  knights at their auberges the rations they received for them, with  such luxuries as could be purchased by their yearly allowance for that  purpose, expended annually very large sums in addition, and supplied  their tables with every dainty, in order to gain popularity and goodwill  among the members of the langue.    Not only did the post of bailiff confer upon its owner a very high  position at Rhodes, but it was a stepping stone to the most lucrative  offices in their langues. The bailiffs at Rhodes had the right of  claiming any of the grand priories or bailiwicks at home that might  fall vacant, and the grand master was frequently chosen from among their  number, as, by being present at Rhodes, they had many advantages in the  way of making themselves popular among the electors. The emoluments of  some of these provincial bailiwicks were large; and as the bailiffs at  Rhodes were generally elected by seniority--although younger knights who  had greatly distinguished themselves were sometimes chosen--they were  usually glad to resign the heavy work and responsibility of their  position at Rhodes, and to retire to the far easier position of a  provincial bailiff. In the majority of cases, doubtless, the fortunes  of the high officials were obtained from the money amassed when in  possession of rich commanderies at home; but even this was assuredly  incompatible with their vows of poverty.    His hours of leisure Gervaise spent either on the water or in the  saddle, and his love of exercise of all sorts excited the wonder and  even the amusement of his companions, who for the most part preferred  spending the time at their disposal in sleep, in idly looking out from  a shaded room at what was going on outside, or in visits to friends and  relations at the auberges of the langues to which they belonged. The  natural consequence was, that by the time he reached the end of his  three years' pageship, Gervaise was indisputably superior in strength,  activity, and skill in military exercises, to any of his companions.  The majority of these, after completing their time, returned to the  headquarters of their langue at home, to pass their time there, until of  an age to be eligible for the charge of a commandery obtained for them  by family influence, which had no small share in the granting of these  appointments. As it was known, however, that Gervaise intended to remain  permanently in the Island, his progress was watched with particular  attention by his instructors; and, seeing his own earnestness in the  matter, they took special pains with his training. The bailiff of  Auvergne continued to take much interest in him, inquiring often from  the officers in charge of the pages, and from his instructors, of his  conduct and progress, and occasionally sending for him to his auberge  and talking with him as to his life and progress. Just before his  pageship terminated, he said to him, \"I was rather puzzled at first,  Gervaise, as to what we should do with you when your term of office  concluded, but I am so no longer, for, although you are some two years  younger than the professed knights who come out here, you are better  fitted than the majority to take your place in the naval expeditions,  and to fight the Moslem pirates. I will see that you have your share of  these adventures. All young knights are, as you know, obliged to make  three voyages, but beyond that many of them do not care to share in  the rough life at sea, and prefer the bustle, and, I grieve to say,  the gaiety and pleasures of this city. For one, then, really eager  to distinguish himself, the opportunities are frequent. When danger  threatens, or heavy engagements are expected, every knight is desirous  of bearing his part in the fray; but this is not the case when the work  to be done "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4940"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Senior Year at High School (#11)"],[1,"curio, and said:    \"I wish to thank you, Miss Harlowe, for inviting me to become a member  of this house party. I appreciate your invitation more than I can say.\"    \"I hope you will enjoy yourself, Mr. Hammond,\" replied Grace rather  coldly.    \"There is little doubt of that,\" was the ready answer. \"How well Marian  is looking to-night. I am surprised at the difference a really grown-up  gown makes in her.\"    Grace glanced at Marian, who in her eyes looked anything but well.    \"Mr. Hammond,\" she said slowly, looking straight at him. \"I do not in  the least agree with you. Marian is not yet eighteen, and to-night she  looks like anything but the school-girl that she did this afternoon. If  her mother were at home I am sure that she would never allow Marian to  have such a gown made, and I cannot fully understand what mischievous  influence prompted her to make herself appear so utterly ridiculous  to-night.\"    \"Miss Harlowe,\" said the young man, his face darkening ominously, \"your  tone is decidedly offensive. Do I understand you to insinuate that I  have in any way influenced Miss Barber as to her manner of dress?\"    \"I insinuate nothing,\" replied Grace, rather contemptuously. \"If the  coat fits you wear it.\"    \"Miss Harlowe,\" answered the young man almost savagely, \"I cannot  understand why, after having included me in this house party, you  deliberately insult me; but I advise you to be more careful in the  future as to your remarks or I shall be tempted to forget the courtesy  due a young woman, and repay you in your own coin.\"    \"Mr. Hammond,\" replied Grace with cold scorn, \"I acknowledge that my  last remark to you was exceedingly rude, but nothing can palliate the  offense of your reply. As a matter of interest, let me state that I am  not in the least alarmed at your threat, for only a coward would ever  attempt to bully a girl.\"    With these words Grace moved quickly away, leaving Mr. Henry Hammond to  digest her answer as best he might.          CHAPTER X    CHRISTMAS WITH JUDGE      It was Christmas Eve, and the great soft flakes of snow that fell  continuously gave every indication of a white Christmas. The north wind  howled and blustered through the tree tops, making the judge and his  young guests congratulate themselves on being safely sheltered from the  storm.    The day had been clear and cold, and the entire party had driven on  bob-sleds to the strip of woods just outside the town, where the boys  had cut down a Christmas tree, and had brought it triumphantly home,  while the girls had piled the sleds with evergreens and ground pine. On  the return a stop had been made at the market, and great quantities of  holly had been bought. Even the sprig of mistletoe for the chandelier in  the hall had not been forgotten.    \"We'll hurry up and get everything ready before the judge comes in,\"  planned Grace. \"We'll put this mistletoe right here, and Nora, you must  see to it that you lead him over until he stands directly under it. Then  we will all surround him. Miriam, will you tell Miss Putnam? We want her  to be in it, too.\"    The young folks worked untiringly and a little before five the last  trail of ground pine was in place, and the decorators stood back and  reviewed their work with pride.    The great hall and drawing room had been transformed into a veritable  corner of the forest, and the red holly berries peeping out from the  green looked like little flame-colored heralds of Christmas. Here and  there a poinsettia made a gorgeous blot of color, while on an  old-fashioned mahogany what-not stood an immense bowl of deep-red roses,  the joint contribution of the Phi Sigma Tau.    \"It looks beautiful,\" sighed Jessica, \"we really ought to feel proud of  ourselves.\"    The entire party was grouped about the big drawing room.    \"I am always proud of myself,\" asserted Hippy. \"In the first place there  is a great deal of me to be proud of; and in the second place I don't  believe in hiding my light under a bushel.\"    \"Now Jessica, you have started him,\" said David with a groan. \"He'll  talk about himself for an hour unless Reddy and I lead him out.\"    \"I dare you to lead me out,\" defied Hippy.    \"I never take a dare,\" replied David calmly, making a lunge for Hippy.  \"Come on, Reddy.\"    Reddy sprang forward and Hippy was hustled out, chanting as he went:        \"Now children do not blame me, for I have so          much to say,      That from myself I really cannot tear myself          away,\"    and remained outside for the space of two minutes, when he suddenly  reappeared wearing Grace's coat and Miriam Nesbit's plumed hat and  performed a wild dance down the middle of the room that made his friends  shriek with laughter.    \"Hippy, when will you be good?\" inquired Miriam, as she rescued her hat,  and smoothed its ruffled plumes.    \"Never, I hope,\" replied Hippy promptly.    \"That's the judge's ring,\" cried Grace as the sound of the bell echoed  through the big room, and the guests flocked into the hall to welcome  their host.    \"This is what I call a warm reception,\" laughed Judge Putnam, as he  stood surrounded by laughing faces.    \"I claim the privilege of escorting Judge Putnam down the hall,\" cried  Nora, and she conducted him directly to where the mistletoe hung.    \"I must be an object of envy to you young men,\" chuckled the judge, as  he walked unsuspectingly to his fate.    \"The mistletoe! The mistletoe! You're standing under the mistletoe!\" was  the cry and the seven girls and Miss Putnam joined hands and circled  around the judge. Then each girl in turn stepped up and imprinted a kiss  on the good old judge's cheek.    [Illustration: The Girls Circled Around the Judge]    \"Well, I never!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, but there were tears in  his blue eyes and his voice trembled as he said to his sister, who was  the last to salute him, \"It takes me back over the years, Mary.\"    It was a merry party that ran upstairs to dress for dinner that night,  and the spirit of Christmas seemed to have settled down upon the judge's  borrowed household.    The only thing that had dimmed Grace Harlowe's pleasure in the least was  the passage at arms that had occurred between herself and Henry Hammond.  Grace's conscience smote her. She felt that she should not have spoken  to him as she had, even though she disliked him. To be sure, his remark  about Marian's gown had caused her inwardly to accuse him of influencing  Marian to make herself ridiculous in the eyes of her friends, but she  could not forgive herself for having unthinkingly spoken as she had  done.    After due reflection Grace decided that she had acted unwisely, and made  up her mind that she would try to make amends for her unkind retort. She  decided, however, to see if she could not persuade Marian to go back to  her usual style of dress.    Grace hurried through her dressing, and looking very sweet and wholesome  in her dainty blue organdie, knocked at the door of the room occupied by  Marian and Eva Allen.    \"Come in,\" cried Eva's voice, and Grace entered, to find Eva completely  dressed in a pretty white pongee, eyeing with great disfavor the  tight-fitting princess gown of black silk that the maid was struggling  to hook Marian into.    \"Marian!\" exclaimed Grace. \"What ever made you have a black evening  gown? It makes you look years older than you are.\"    \"That's exactly what I told her,\" said Eva Allen, \"but she won't believe  it.\"    Marian looked sulky, then said rather sullenly: \"I really can't see what  difference it makes to you girls what I wear. I haven't interfered with  you in the matter of your gowns, have I?\"    \"No,\" replied Grace truthfully, \"but Marian, I think the judge likes to  see us in the simple evening dresses we have been accustomed to wearing,  and as we are his guests we ought to try and please him. Besides, you  would look so much better in your white embroidered dress, or your pink  silk, that you wore to commencement last year.\"    \"I don't agree with, you at all,\" replied Marian so stiffly that the  maid smiled openly, as she put the final touches to Marian's hair  preparatory to adjusting the cluster of puffs that had completed her  astonishing coiffure the night before. \"Furthermore, I have been assured  by persons of extreme good taste that my new gowns give me a distinct  individuality I have never before possessed.\"    \"That person of extreme good taste is named Hammond,\" thought Grace.  \"That remark about 'individuality' sounds just like him. I'll make one  more appeal to her.\"    Going over to where Marian stood viewing herself with satisfaction in  the long mirror, Grace slipped her arm around her old friend.    \"Listen, dear,\" she coaxed, \"we mustn't quarrel on Christmas Eve. You  know we are all Phi Sigma Taus and it seems so strange to see you  looking so stately and grown up. Put on your white dress to-night, just  to please me.\"    But Marian drew away from her, frowning angrily. \"Really, Grace,\" she  exclaimed, \"you are too provoking for any use, and I wish you would mind  your own business and let me wear what I choose.\"    \"Please pardon me, Marian,\" said Grace, turning toward the door. \"I am  sorry to have troubled you,\" and was gone like a flash.    \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Marian Barber!\" burst forth Eva.  \"The idea of telling Grace to mind her own business! You haven't been a  bit like yourself lately, and I know that it's all on account of that  Henry Hammond, the old snake.\"    \"You will oblige me greatly, Eva, by referring more respectfully to my  friend, Mr. Hammond,\" said Marian with offended dignity. Then she sailed  out of the room, her train dragging half a yard behind her, while Eva  turned to the mirror with a contemptuous sniff and powdered her little  freckled nose almost savagely before following her irate roommate down  stairs.
