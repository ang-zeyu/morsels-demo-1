Armed with crayon and drawing-paper, Champlain was despatched to  seek from the natives some important geographical information. Dispensing  knives and biscuit as a friendly invitation, the savages gathered about  him, assured by their gifts, when he proceeded to impart to them their  first lesson in topographical drawing. He pictured to them the bay on the  north side of Cape Anne, which he had just traversed, and signifying to  them that he desired to know the course of the shore on the south, they  immediately gave him an example of their apt scholarship by drawing with  the same crayon an accurate outline of Massachusetts Bay, and finished up  Champlain's own sketch by introducing the Merrimac River, which, not having  been seen, owing to the presence of Plum Island, which stretches like a  curtain before its mouth, he had omitted to portray. The intelligent  natives volunteered a bit of history. By placing six pebbles at equal  distances, they intimated that Massachusetts Bay was occupied by six  tribes, and governed by as many chiefs. [45] He learned from them,  likewise, that the inhabitants of this region subsisted by agriculture, as  did those at the mouth of the Saco, and that they were very numerous.    Leaving Cape Anne on Saturday the 16th of July, De Monts entered  Massachusetts Bay, sailed into Boston harbor, and anchored on the western  side of Noddle's Island, now better known as East Boston. In passing into  the bay, they observed large patches of cleared land, and many fields of  waving corn both upon the islands and the mainland. The water and the  islands, the open fields and lofty forest-trees, presented fine contrasts,  and rendered the scenery attractive and beautiful. Here for the first time  Champlain observed the log canoe. It was a clumsy though serviceable boat  in still waters, nevertheless unstable and dangerous in unskilful hands.  They saw, issuing into the bay, a large river, coming from the west, which  they named River du Guast, in honor of Pierre du Guast, Sieur de Monts, the  patentee of La Cadie, and the patron and director of this expedition. This  was Charles River, seen, evidently just at its confluence with the Mystic.  [46]    On Sunday, the 17th of July, 1605, they left Boston harbor, threading their  way among the islands, passing leisurely along the south shore, rounding  Point Allerton on the peninsula of Nantasket, gliding along near Cohasset  and Scituate, and finally cast anchor at Brant Point, upon the southern  borders of Marshfield. When they left the harbor of Boston, the islands and  mainland were swarming with the native population. The Indians were,  naturally enough, intensely interested in this visit of the little French  barque. It may have been the first that had ever made its appearance in the  bay. Its size was many times greater than any water-craft of their own.  Spreading its white wings and gliding silently away without oarsmen, it  filled them with surprise and admiration. The whole population was astir.  The cornfields and fishing stations were deserted. Every canoe was manned,  and a flotilla of their tiny craft came to attend, honor, and speed the  parting guests, experiencing, doubtless, a sense of relief that they were  going, and filled with a painful curiosity to know the meaning of this  mysterious visit.    Having passed the night at Brant Point, they had not advanced more than two  leagues along a sandy shore dotted with wigwams and gardens, when they were  forced to enter a small harbor, to await a more favoring wind. The Indians  flocked about them, greeted them with cordiality, and invited them to enter  the little river which flows into the harbor, but this they were unable to  do, as the tide was low and the depth insufficient. Champlain's attention  was attracted by several canoes in the bay, which had just completed their  morning's work in fishing for cod. The fish were taken with a primitive  hook and line, apparently in a manner not very different from that of the  present day. The line was made of a filament of bark stripped from the  trunk of a tree; the hook was of wood, having a sharp bone, forming a barb,  lashed to it with a cord of a grassy fibre, a kind of wild hemp, growing  spontaneously in that region. Champlain landed, distributed trinkets among  the natives, examined and sketched an outline of the place, which  identifies it as Plymouth harbor, which captain John Smith visited in 1614,  and where the May Flower, still six years later landed the first permanent  colony planted upon New England soil.    After a day at Plymouth, the little bark weighed anchor, swept down Cape  Cod, approaching near to the reefs of Billingsgate, describing a complete  semicircle, and finally, with some difficulty, doubled the cape whose white  sands they had seen in the distance glittering in the sunlight and which  appropriately they named _Cap Blanc_. This cape, however, had been visited  three years before by Bartholomew Gosnold, and named Cape Cod, which  appellation it has retained to the present time. Passing down on the  outside of the cape some distance, they came to anchor, sent explorers on  the shore, who ascending on of the lofty sand-banks [47] which may still be  seen there silently resisting the winds and waves, discovered further to  the south, what is now known as Nauset harbor, entirely surrounded by  Indian cabins. The next day, the 20th of July, 1605, they effected an  entrance without much difficulty. The bay was spacious, being nine or ten  miles in circumference. Along the borders, there were, here and there,  cultivated patches, interspersed with dwellings of the natives. The wigwam  was cone-shaped, heavily thatched with reeds, having an orifice at the apex  for the emission of smoke. In the fields were growing Indian corn,  Brazilian beans, pumpkins, radishes, and tobacco; and in the woods were oak  and hickory and red cedar. During their stay in the harbor they encountered  an easterly storm, which continued four days, so raw and chilling that they  were glad to hug their winter cloaks about them on the 22d of July. The  natives were friendly and cordial, and entered freely into conversation  with Champlain; but, as the language of each party was not understood by  the other, the information he obtained from them was mostly by signs, and  consequently too general to be historically interesting or important.    The first and only act of hostility by the natives which De Monts and his  party had thus far experienced in their explorations on the entire coast  occurred in this harbor. Several of the men had gone ashore to obtain fresh  water. Some of the Indians conceived an uncontrollable desire to capture  the copper vessels which they saw in their hands. While one of the men was  stooping to dip water from a spring, one of the savages darted upon him and  snatched the coveted vessel from his hand. An encounter followed, and, amid  showers of arrows and blows, the poor sailor was brutally murdered. The  victorious Indian, fleet as the reindeer, escaped with his companions,  bearing his prize with him into the depths of the forest. The natives on  the shore, who had hitherto shown the greatest friendliness, soon came to  De Monts, and by signs disowned any participation in the act, and assured  him that the guilty parties belonged far in the interior. Whether this was  the truth or a piece of adroit diplomacy, it was nevertheless accepted by  De Monts, since punishment could only be administered at the risk of  causing the innocent to suffer instead of the guilty.    The young sailor whose earthly career was thus suddenly terminated, whose  name even has not come down to us, was doubtless the first European, if we  except Thorvald, the Northman, whose mortal remains slumber in the soil of  Massachusetts.    As this voyage of discovery had been planned and provisioned for only six  weeks, and more than five had already elapsed, on the 25th of July De Monts  and his party left Nauset harbor, to join the colony still lingering at St.  Croix. In passing the bar, they came near being wrecked, and consequently  gave to the harbor the significant appellation of _Port de Mallebarre_, a  name which has not been lost, but nevertheless, like the shifting sands of  that region, has floated away from its original moorings, and now adheres  to the sandy cape of Monomoy.    On their return voyage, they made a brief stop at Saco, and likewise at the  mouth of the Kennebec. At the latter point they had an interview with the  sachem, Anassou, who informed them that a ship had been there, and that the  men on board her had seized, under color of friendship, and killed five  savages belonging to that river. From the description given by Anassou,  Champlain was convinced that the ship was English, and subsequent events  render it quite certain that it was the \"Archangel,\" fitted out by the Earl  of Southampton and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and commanded by Captain George  Weymouth. The design of the expedition was to fix upon an eligible site for  a colonial plantation, and, in pursuance of this purpose, Weymouth anchored  off Monhegan on the 28th of May, 1605, _new style_, and, after spending a  month in explorations of the region contiguous, left for England on the  26th of June. [48] He had seized and carried away five of the natives,  having concealed them in the hold of his ship, and Anassou, under the  circumstances, naturally supposed they had been killed. The statement of  the sachem, that the natives captured belonged to the river where Champlain  then was, namely, the Kennebec, goes far to prove that Weymouth's  explorations were in the Kennebec, or at least in the network of waters  then comprehended under that appellation, and not in the Penobscot or in  any other river farther east, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6659"],[0,"History of King Charles the Second of England (#11)"],[1,"red, took place before the execution of  King Charles the First, and when, of course, the fortunes of the family  were not so desperate as they afterward became. Queen Henrietta had  a great many conversations with Anne Maria before the prince arrived,  in which she praised very highly his person and his accomplishments.  She narrated to the duchess the various extraordinary adventures and  the narrow escapes which the prince had met with in the course of his  wanderings in England; she told her how dutiful and kind he had been  to her as a son, and how efficient and courageous in his father's cause  as a soldier. She described his appearance and his manners, and foretold  how he would act, what tastes and preferences he would form, and how  he would be regarded in the French court. The young duchess listened  to all this with an appearance of indifference and unconcern, which  was partly real and partly only assumed. She could not help feeling  some curiosity to see her cousin, but her head was too full of the  grander destination of being the wife of the emperor to think much of  the pretensions of this wandering and homeless exile.    Prince Charles, on his arrival, went first to Paris, where he found  his mother. There was an invitation for them here to proceed to  Fontainebleau, where, as has already been stated, the young king and  his court were now residing. They went there accordingly, and were  received with every mark of attention and honor. The queen regent took  the young king into the carriage of state, and rode some miles along  the avenue, through the forest, to meet the prince and his mother when  they were coming. They were attended with the usual cortege of carriages  and horsemen, and they moved with all the etiquette and ceremony proper  to be observed in the reception of royal visitors.    When the carriages met in the forest, they stopped, and the  distinguished personages contained in them alighted. Queen Henrietta  introduced her son to the queen regent and to Louis, the French king,  and also to other personages of distinction who were in their train.  Among them was Anne Maria. The queen regent took Henrietta and the  prince into the carriage with her and the young king, and they proceeded  thus together back to the palace. Prince Charles was somewhat  embarrassed in making all these new acquaintances, in circumstances,  too, of so much ceremony and parade, and the more so, as his knowledge  of the French language was imperfect. He could understand it when  spoken, but could not speak it well himself, and he appeared,  accordingly, somewhat awkward and confused. He seemed particularly at  a loss in his intercourse with Anne Maria. She was a little older than  himself, and, being perfectly at home, both in the ceremonies of the  occasion and in the language of the company, she felt entirely at her  ease herself; and yet, from her natural temperament and character, she  assumed such an air and bearing as would tend to prevent the prince  from being so. In a word, it happened then as it has often happened  since on similar occasions, that the beau was afraid of the belle.    The party returned to the palace. On alighting, the little king gave  his hand to his aunt, the Queen of England, while Prince Charles gave  his to the queen regent, and thus the two matrons were gallanted into  the hall. The prince had a seat assigned him on the following day in  the queen regent's drawing room, and was thus regularly instated as  an inmate of the royal household. He remained here several days, and  at length the whole party returned to Paris.    Anne Maria, in after years, wrote reminiscences of her early life,  which were published after her death. In this journal she gives an  account of her introduction to the young prince, and of her first  acquaintance with him. It is expressed as follows:    \"He was only sixteen or seventeen years of age, rather tall, with a  fine head, black hair, a dark complexion, and a tolerably agreeable  countenance. But he neither spoke nor understood French, which was  very inconvenient. Nevertheless, every thing was done to amuse him,  and, during the three days that he remained at Fontainebleau, there  were hunts and every other sport which could be commanded in that  season. He paid his respects to all the princesses, and I discovered  immediately that the Queen of England wished to persuade me that he  had fallen in love with me. She told me that he talked of me  incessantly; that, were she not to prevent it, he would be in my  apartment [Footnote: This means at her residence. The whole suite of  rooms occupied by a family is called, in France, their _apartment_.]  at all hours; that he found me quite to his taste, and that he was in  despair on account of the death of the empress, for he was afraid that  they would seek to marry me to the emperor. I listened to all she said  as became me, but it did not have as much effect upon me as probably  she wished.\"    After spending a few days at Fontainebleau, the whole party returned  to Paris, and Queen Henrietta and the prince took up their abode again  in the Palace Royal, or, as it is now more commonly called, the Palais  Royal. Charles was much impressed with the pomp and splendor of the  French court, so different from the rough mode of life to which he had  been accustomed in his campaigns and wanderings in England. The  etiquette and formality, however, were extreme, every thing, even the  minutest motions, being regulated by nice rules, which made social  intercourse and enjoyment one perpetual ceremony. But, notwithstanding  all this pomp and splendor, and the multitude of officers and attendants  who were constantly on service, there seems to have been, in the results  obtained, a strange mixture of grand parade with discomfort and  disorder. At one time at Fontainebleau, at a great entertainment, where  all the princes and potentates that had been drawn there by the wedding  were assembled, the cooks quarreled in the kitchen, and one of the  courses of the supper failed entirely in consequence of their  dissensions; and at another time, as a large party of visitors were  passing out through a suite of rooms in great state, to descend a grand  staircase, where some illustrious foreigners, who were present, were  to take their leave, they found the apartments through which they were  to pass all dark. The servants had neglected or forgotten to light  them.    These and similar incidents show that there may be regal luxury and  state without order or comfort, as there may be regal wealth and power  without any substantial happiness. Notwithstanding this, however,  Prince Charles soon became strongly interested in the modes of life  to which he was introduced at Paris and at Fontainebleau. There were  balls, parties, festivities, and excursions of pleasure without number,  his interest in these all being heightened by the presence of Anne  Maria, whom he soon began to regard with a strong degree of that  peculiar kind of interest which princesses and heiresses inspire. In  Anne Maria's memoirs of her early life, we have a vivid description  of many of the scenes in which both she herself and Charles were such  prominent actors. She wrote always with great freedom, and in a very  graphic manner, so that the tale which she tells of this period of her  life forms a very entertaining narrative.    Anne Maria gives a very minute account of what took place between  herself and Charles on several occasions in the course of their  acquaintance, and describes particularly various balls, and parties,  and excursions of pleasure on which she was attended by the young  prince. Her vanity was obviously gratified by the interest which Charles  seemed to take in her, but she was probably incapable of any feelings  of deep and disinterested love, and Charles made no impression upon  her heart. She reserved herself for the emperor.    For example, they were all one night invited to a grand ball by the  Duchess de Choisy. This lady lived in a magnificent mansion, called  the Hotel de Choisy. Just before the time came for the party of visitors  to go, the Queen of England came over with Charles to the apartments  of Anne Maria. The queen came ostensibly to give the last touches to  the adjustment of the young lady's dress, and to the arrangement of  her hair, but really, without doubt, in pursuance of her policy of  taking every occasion to bring the young people together.    \"She came,\" says Anne Maria, in her narrative, \"to dress me and arrange  my hair herself. She came for this purpose to my apartments, and took  the utmost pains to set me off to the best advantage, and the Prince  of Wales held the flambeau near me to light my toilet the whole time.  I wore black, white, and carnation; and my jewelry was fastened by  ribbons of the same colors. I wore a plume of the same kind; all these  had been selected and ordered by my aunt Henrietta. The queen regent,  who knew that I was in my aunt Henrietta's hands, sent for me to come  and see her when I was all ready, before going to the ball. I  accordingly went, and this gave the prince an opportunity to go at  once to the Hotel de Choisy, and be ready there to receive me when I  should arrive I found him there at the door, ready to hand me from my  coach. I stopped in a chamber to readjust my hair, and the Prince of  Wales again held a flambeau for me. This time, too, he brought his  cousin, Prince Rupert, as an interpreter between us; for, believe it  who will, though he could understand every word I said to him, he could  not reply the least sentence to me in French. When the ball was finished  and we retired, the prince followed me to the porter's lodge of my  hotel, [Footnote: In all the great houses in Paris, the principal  buildings of the edifice stand back from the street, surrounding a  court yard, which has sometimes shrubbery and flowers and a fountain  in the center."]]]
