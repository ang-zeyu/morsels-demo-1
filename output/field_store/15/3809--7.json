He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his  heart: I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of  his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed  both for his life and reason.    \"Compose yourself,\" said I.    He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of  despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he  uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified.  And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well  under control, \"Have you a graduated glass?\" he asked.    I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him  what he asked.    He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of  the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which  was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the  crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly,  and to throw off small    79)    fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition  ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded  again more slowly to a watery green. My visitor, who had watched  these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass  upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of  scrutiny.    \"And now,\" said he, \"to settle what remains. Will you be wise?  will you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my  hand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or  has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before  you answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide,  you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor  wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal  distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if  you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and  new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in  this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a  prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\"    \"Sir,\" said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly  possessing, \"you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder  that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I  have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause  before I see the end.\"    \"It is well,\" replied my visitor. \"Lanyon,    80)    you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our  profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most  narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of  transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors--  behold!\"    He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry  followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held  on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I  looked there came, I thought, a change--he seemed to swell--  his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt  and alter--and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and  leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from  that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.    \"O God!\" I screamed, and \"O God!\" again and again; for there  before my eyes--pale and shaken, and half-fainting, and groping  before him with his hands, like a man restored from death--  there stood Henry Jekyll!    What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set  on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul  sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my  eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life  is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror  sits by me at all hours of the day and night; I feel that my days  are numbered, and that I    81)    must die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral  turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence,  I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror.  I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring  your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature  who crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll's own  confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every  corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.                                                 HASTIE LANYON    82)                        HENRY JEKYLL'S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE    I WAS born in the year 18--- to a large fortune, endowed besides  with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the  respect of the wise and good among my fellow-men, and thus, as  might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable  and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a  certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the  happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with  my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than  commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about  that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of  reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my  progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to  a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned  such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views  that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost  morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting    83)    nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my  faults, that made me what I was and, with even a deeper trench  than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of  good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature. In this  case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that  hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one  of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a  double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me  were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside  restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye  of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow  and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific  studies, which led wholly toward the mystic and the  transcendental, re-acted and shed a strong light on this  consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every  day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the  intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose  partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful  shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two,  because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that  point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same  lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known  for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous, and independent  denizens. I, for my    84)    part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one  direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side,  and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough  and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that  contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could  rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically  both; and from an early date, even before the course of my  scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked  possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with  pleasure, as a beloved day-dream, on the thought of the  separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could but  be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all  that was unbearable; the unjust delivered from the aspirations  might go his way, and remorse of his more upright twin; and the  just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path,  doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no  longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this  extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these  incongruous fagots were thus bound together that in the agonised  womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously  struggling. How, then, were they dissociated?    I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side-light  began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I  began to perceive    85)    more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling  immateriality, the mist-like transience of this seemingly so  solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to  have the power to shake and to pluck back that fleshly vestment,  even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two  good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch  of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that  the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man's  shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but  returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure.  Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my  discoveries were incomplete. Enough, then, that I not only  recognised my natural body for the mere aura and effulgence of  certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to  compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from  their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted,  none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and  bore the stamp, of lower elements in my soul.    I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of  practice. I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so  potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity,  might by the least scruple of an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#11)"],[1,"in my satchel are other useful things to fight  with.\"    \"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man's voice.  \"Our  Champion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creatures  shuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat.  But they  were in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because he  had to save his breath for fighting.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can  fight, so we ought to defeat the Gargoyles.\"    \"But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen to  let the bears eat him?  And if he was invis'ble, and the bears  invis'ble, who knows that they really ate him up?\"    \"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseen  man; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the  invisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain  one can be plainly seen by all eyes.  When the Champion killed a bear  everyone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all  saw several pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared  again when the bears devoured them.\"    They now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage,  and after the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped  mountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to  travel in order to reach it, they again started upon their journey.    They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more  pretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak  to them.  Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were  many of the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of.    About noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty  orchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums  that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:    \"There are bears near by.  Be careful.\"    The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.  Dorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed from  it and was grazing some distance away.    The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:    \"You cannot escape the bears that way.\"    \"How CAN we 'scape?\" asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger is  always the hardest to face.    \"You must take to the river,\" was the reply.  \"The bears will not  venture upon the water.\"    \"But we would be drowned!\" exclaimed the girl.    \"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentle  tones seemed to belong to a young girl.  \"You are strangers in the  Valley of Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save  you.\"    The next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where  it grew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard.    \"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the soles of all  your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water without  sinking below the surface.  It is a secret the bears do not know, and  we people of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so  escape our enemies.\"    \"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf upon  the soles of Dorothy's shoes and then upon his own.  The girl took a  leaf and rubbed it upon the kitten's paws, and the rest of the plant  was handed to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully  rubbed it upon all four of Jim's hoofs and then upon the tires of the  buggy-wheels.  He had nearly finished this last task when a low  growling was suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick  viciously with his heels.    \"Quick!  To the water or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, and  without hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon  the broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her  arms.  They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange  plant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream  the Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.    The horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes  appeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.    \"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himself  from his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed.  As  soon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself  safe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water toward  Dorothy.    As the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against  his cheek and heard a low, fierce growl.  At once he began stabbing at  the air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substance  because when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood.  The  third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a  fall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,  which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer.  The beast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at  its terrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and  rushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more  bears were near.    On the river, however, the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe.  Dorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current  of the water, and the others made haste to join her.  The Wizard opened  his satchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the  cuts Jim had received from the claws of the bears.    \"I think we'd better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy.  \"If our unknown friend hadn't warned us, and told us what to do, we  would all be dead by this time.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be  flowing in the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest  way for us to travel.\"    Zeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and  drew them rapidly over the smooth water.  The kitten was at first  dreadfully afraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon  Eureka was frisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit.  Once a little fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it  in her mouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned  her to be careful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no  more fishes were careless enough to swim within reach.    After a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river  curved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley  before they came to the Pyramid Mountain.  There were few houses in  this part, and few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they  might encounter more of the savage bears, which they had learned to  dread with all their hearts.    \"You'll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast as  you can go.\"    \"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I'll do my best.  But you must  remember I'm old, and my dashing days are past and gone.\"    All three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim  needed no guidance of any sort.  The horse was still smarting from the  sharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land and  headed toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome  creatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in  a way that made Dorothy catch her breath.    Then Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of the  bears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew.  His boney legs  moved so fast they could scarcely be seen, and the Wizard clung fast to  the seat and yelled \"Whoa!\" at the top of his voice.    \"I--I'm 'fraid he's--he's running away!\" gasped Dorothy.    \"I KNOW he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps up  that gait--and the harness or the buggy don't break.\"    Jim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware of  it he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizard  and Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft  grass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped.  Dorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron  rail of the seat, and that saved her.  She squeezed the kitten, though,  until it screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious  sounds that led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all.          10.  The Braided Man of Pyramid Mountain      The mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that  its point was lost in the clouds.  Directly facing the place where Jim  had stopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway.  The  stairs were cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad  and not very steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and  at the arched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big.  At the foot of the stairs was a sign reading:    WARNING.  These steps lead to the Land of the Gargoyles.  DANGER!  KEEP  OUT.      \"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"  said Dorothy, gravely.    \"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh.  \"Still, I don't care to drag any passengers.  You'll all have to walk.\"    \"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully.    \"Then you'll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that's all,\" answered Jim.    \"We'll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard.  \"It's the only way to get out  of the Valley of Voe.\"    So they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jim  next, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to  the harness.    The light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so that  the Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way.  But  this enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing  where there was a rift in the side of the mountain that let"]]]
