[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],[0,"Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#11)"],[1," what has been said of Mr.  Briggs, will also apply to them. Nevertheless, between 1846 and 1848,  Jason W. Briggs organized the Beloit branch for Strang's organization,  or else the Reorganite history is at fault. They say that in 1849 the  Beloit branch was a Strangite branch, and remained with Mr. Strang  until 1850 (Reorg. Hist., 3:737). Most of these members--and they were  few--after they left the Strangites joined the organization of William  B. Smith's organizations were without authority, so whatever power  those unfaithful members had before 1844, they lost when they joined  these apostate organizations of Strang, et al. For they could not take  power or authority with them. This truth is expressed by an officer  of the Reorganized Church who said, at Galland's Grove, Iowa, October  25, 1863: \"Whenever individuals claiming authority under the church  as organized by the first Joseph, become members of any faction, they  immediately become divested of all authority except that received from  that faction.\" (True Saints' Herald, Vol. 4, page 158).    5. In a vain effort to blind the readers of the Saints' Herald the  \"defender\" tries to make it appear that I state here that Zenas H.  Gurley left the \"Reorganized\" church; but from the way he writes it,  it is evident that he doesn't himself believe that any such attempt  was made. Zenas H. Gurley, Sen., died August 28, 1871, and in speaking  of his _family_ in 1886--fifteen years later--it is obvious that the  reference does not include him. That Mr. Gurley left them when he got  on the other side, I have my reasons to believe, but at no time in the  entire publication has he been confounded with his son of the same  name. The son is mentioned _but once_ and then only incidentally and  unavoidably in connection with the withdrawal of Jason W. Briggs from  the \"Reorganization.\" The _family_ of Zenas H. Gurley mentioned here  consisted of his wife Margaret, sons Zenas H. (who was one of their  \"Apostles\") Edwin H., and their wives. The attempt of the writer of  the \"defense\" to throw dust in the eyes of the readers of the _Saints'  Herald_ as he has done here and at many other points, is contemptible.    6. In the \"defense\" that appeared in the Saints' Herald, June 30, 1909,  in answer to this, the statement is made that, \"Those were received  whose original baptisms had been performed either previously to 1844  or by men who held authority previous to 1844.\" This declaration helps  their cause not at all, for whatever authority any of those men who  were active in these various \"factions\" may have held, when in the  Church, they could not take it with them, when they withdrew. Moreover,  action was taken against them and they were divested of all authority  by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from which their  authority came. And what authentic proof have they to offer that these  men had authority in the Prophet's day? Zenas H. Gurley, and Jason  W. Briggs were confessedly, the two most active and most noted in  this work of the \"Reorganization.\" Mr. Gurley, it is true, was senior  president of the 21st quorum of Seventy at Nauvoo before he left the  Church, having been ordained under the direction of President Joseph  Young. He claimed it was by virtue of this office in the Priesthood  that he officiated originally in the bringing forth of the \"New  Organization,\" in 1852. (True Saints' Herald, Vol. I, page 56). Yet the  president of the \"Reorganization\" himself repudiates that authority.  (See section on Succession, subject _Properly Ordained?_)    It is claimed by the \"Reorganization\" that Mr. Briggs was an Elder in  1842, but that also is mere sayso, there is no authentic record for it.  In proof of this I submit the following correspondence.                                               Salt Lake City., Feb. 21, 1905.        _Mr. Heman C. Smith, Church Historian, Reorganized Church_.        Dear Sir: The 3rd volume of the \"History of the Reorganized Church,\"      page 737, states that Jason W. Briggs was ordained an Elder in 1842.      Will you kindly inform me who ordained him and the date of the      ordination; also the authority on which the statement of the      ordination is made, and oblige?                                        Very respectfully,                                            JOSEPH F. SMITH, JR.    The reply dated Lamoni, Iowa, Feb. 26, 1905, is as follows:        _Mr. Joseph F. Smith, Jr._ _Salt Lake City, U._        Dear Sir: Yours of February 21, is at hand and contents noted.        Replying we will say we are not able to inform you as to who      officiated in the ordination of Elder Jason W. Briggs to the office      of Elder; nor can we give you the date any nearer than the year 1842.        The authority upon which the statement was made is the sworn statement      of Elder Briggs in the Temple Lot Case. See Plaintiff's Abstract, page      393.                                         Very respectfully,                                             HEMAN C. SMITH.    In the formation of the \"New Organization\" (now the \"Reorganization\")  Mr. Briggs acted by virtue of the office of High Priest. Mr. Gurley  says they had \"two High Priests (Mr. Briggs being one of them) and one  senior President of the Seventies.\" (The Seventy being himself). See  True Saints' Herald, Vol. I, page 56. And in the \"revelation\" given by  Mr. Deam it was stated that \"It is my will that you respect authority  in my Church, therefore let the greatest among you preside at your  conference.\" (True Saints' Herald, Vol. I, p. 55). Mr. Jason W. Briggs  was chosen to preside (p. 57). Where did he get his authority as a High  Priest by which he had the right to preside? From James J. Strang. The  Voree record of conferences, April 8, 1846, contains the following:  \"Resolved unanimously that Jason W. Briggs be ordained a High Priest.  Ordination under the hands of President James J. Strang and William  Marks.\"    7. In reply to this the Reorganite \"defender\" declares that I have not  been fair to Mr. Briggs, that if he believed \"even one section out  of what was in excess of one hundred, both as to its genuineness and  authenticity, it would necessarily follow that he believed to an extent  in the mission of Joseph Smith through whom it was given, in that case  Joseph F. Smith, Jr., could not truthfully use the language he did in  describing Briggs' attitude toward the Standard works of the Church.\" *  * * * Mr. Briggs denied the _plenary_ inspiration of the sacred books;  but that is neither a denial of the authenticity, or of the partiality  of their inspiration.\"    This is a mere quibble. Mr. Briggs denied the gathering of Israel;  temple building and the ceremonial endowments therein; the salvation  of the dead through the temple ordinances, which the Prophet Joseph  said was \"the burden of the Scriptures;\" the law of tithing and of  consecration, the only law by which Zion could be redeemed and built;  the right of Joseph Smith or any other man to be a sole mouthpiece of  God to the Church; the plenary inspiration and consequent absolute  authority of the _Scriptures_; and the revelation on temple building.  What else he did not believe is not stated; but _if_ there is any  fundamental principle in the mission of the Prophet Joseph, or in the  Scriptures that he _did believe_, surely he ought to have full credit  for it!    8. The writer of the \"defense\" also very peevishly objects to the  statement that Mr. Briggs was unstable to the last. He says: \"If  unstable and discontented _to_ the last, he could not have been stable  and contented for a generation preceding the 'last'. If stable and  contented for upwards of thirty years preceding the last (1886,) then  Mr. Smith uttered an untruth, then he reflected a falsehood, when  he said Briggs was 'unstable' and discontent 'to the last.' Why not  tell the truth about him even though an 'apostate?' I see no excuse  for reflecting on his stability any part of his life. If he stepped  momentarily aside from his path in the early part of his life it was  because his north star was obscured by a cloud he could not avoid;  but as soon as the cloud disappeared and his guiding star was again  visible, he resumed his pathway. No lack of stability there. * * * *  Joseph F. Smith, Jr., should tell the truth, even about the dead.\"    Another quibble. This is rather a severe arraignment to come from a  member of the \"Reorganized\" Church, which organization has been from  its beginning so energetic in maligning the leaders of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, both living and dead, accusing them  of every wickedness under the sun, even going so far as to accuse  President Young of being an accomplice in the death of the Prophet  Joseph Smith. (See R. C. Evans, in Toronto Star, of January 28, 1905,  and Saints' Herald, Vol. 32:190.)    Well, let us see wherein we have wrongfully accused Mr. Briggs. He  joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1841; failed  to gather at Nauvoo when commanded; left the Church in 1846 during the  exodus, \"because he had no root;\" joined James J. Strang in 1846 and  remained with him until 1850; left Mr. Strang and followed William  Smith until 1851; left William Smith and joined with Zenas H. Gurley  in the \"New Organization of the Church,\" which finally resulted in the  forming of the \"Reorganized\" Church; remained with this organization  until 1886, when he withdrew from it and died at Harris, Colorado,  January 11, 1899, rejecting the work he performed in all these  organizations. Moreover, he was \"ordained\" April 8, 1846 to the office  of \"High Priest\" by James J. Strang, and declared that Strang was  Joseph Smith's legal successor as this letter will show:    \"The following letter was written in answer to one from Mr. Briggs of  Wisconsin. His letter is too scurrilous to appear in print, therefore  we publish only the reply of Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#11)"],[1,"evel.  Accordingly, I repeat the proposal of last year's Budget Message that the  Federal Government provide financial aid to assist the States in assuring  more nearly equal opportunities for a good education. The proposed Federal  grants for current educational expenditures should be made for the purpose  of improving the educational system where improvement is most needed. They  should not be used to replace existing non-Federal expenditures, or even to  restore merely the situation which existed before the war.    In the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before the war.  Higher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and  for individuals to support higher and more nearly adequate expenditures for  education. But inequality among the States will still remain, and Federal  help will still be needed.    As a part of our total public works program, consideration should be given  to the need for providing adequate buildings for schools and other  educational institutions. In view of current arrears in the construction of  educational facilities, I believe that legislation to authorize grants for  educational facilities, to be matched by similar expenditures by State and  local authorities, should receive the favorable consideration of the  Congress.    The Federal Government has not sought, and will not seek, to dominate  education in the States. It should continue its historic role of leadership  and advice and, for the purpose of equalizing educational opportunity, it  should extend further financial support to the cause of education in areas  where this is desirable.    (l) Federal Government personnel.    The rapid reconversion of the Federal Government from war to peace is  reflected in the demobilization of its civilian personnel. The number of  these employees in continental United States has been reduced by more than  500,000 from the total of approximately 2,900,000 employed in the final  months of the war. I expect that by next June we shall have made a further  reduction of equal magnitude and that there will be continuing reductions  during the next fiscal year. Of the special wartime agencies now remaining,  only a few are expected to continue actively into the next fiscal year.    At the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees, we have  shortened the workweek by one-sixth or more throughout the Government and  have restored holidays. The process of readjustment has been complicated  and costs have been increased by a heavy turn-over in the remaining  personnel--particularly by the loss of some of our best administrators.  Thousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly employed in the  civil service. Many civilians have been transferred from war agencies to  their former peacetime agencies. Recruitment standards, which had to be  relaxed during the war, are now being tightened.    The elimination last autumn of overtime work for nearly all Federal  employees meant a sharp cut in their incomes. For salaried workers, the  blow was softened but by no means offset by the increased rates of pay  which had become effective July 1. Further adjustments to compensate for  increased living costs are required. Moreover, we have long needed a  general upward revision of Federal Government salary scales at all levels  in all branches--legislative, judicial, and executive. Too many in  Government have had to sacrifice too much in economic advantage to serve  the Nation.    Adequate salaries will result in economies and improved efficiency in the  conduct of Government business--gains that will far outweigh the immediate  costs. I hope the Congress will expedite action on salary legislation for  all Federal employees in all branches of the Government. The only exception  I would make is in the case of workers whose pay rates are established by  wage boards; a blanket adjustment would destroy the system by which their  wages are kept aligned with prevailing rates in particular localities. The  wage boards should be sensitive now, as they were during the war, to  changes in local prevailing wage rates and should make adjustments  accordingly.    I hope also that the Congress may see fit to enact legislation for the  adequate protection of the health and safety of Federal employees, for  their coverage under a system of unemployment compensation, and for their  return at Government expense to their homes after separation from wartime  service.    (m) Territories, insular possessions, and the District of Columbia.    The major governments of the world face few problems as important and as  perplexing as those relating to dependent peoples. This Government is  committed to the democratic principle that it is for the dependent peoples  themselves to decide what their status shall be. To this end I asked the  Congress last October to provide a means by which the people of Puerto Rico  might choose their form of government and ultimate status with respect to  the United States. I urge, too, that the Congress promptly accede to the  wishes of the people of Hawaii that the Territory be admitted to statehood  in our Union, and that similar action be taken with respect to Alaska as  soon as it is certain that this is the desire of the people of that great  Territory. The people of the Virgin Islands should be given an increasing  measure of self-government.    We have already determined that the Philippine Islands are to be  independent on July 4, 1946. The ravages of war and enemy occupation,  however, have placed a heavy responsibility upon the United States. I urge  that the Congress complete, as promptly and as generously as may be  possible, legislation which will aid economic rehabilitation for the  Philippines. This will be not only a just acknowledgment of the loyalty of  the people of the Philippines, but it will help to avoid the economic chaos  which otherwise will be their heritage from our common war. Perhaps no  event in the long centuries of colonialism gives more hope for the pattern  of the future than the independence of the Philippines.    The District of Columbia, because of its special relation to the Federal  Government, has been treated since 1800 as a dependent area. We should move  toward a greater measure of local self-government consistent with the  constitutional status of the District. We should take adequate steps to  assure that citizens of the United States are not denied their franchise  merely because they reside at the Nation's Capital.    III. THE BUDGET FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM    FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1947    SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET    For the first time since the fiscal year 1930 the Budget for the next  fiscal year will require no increase in the national debt.    Expenditures of all kinds, authorized and recommended, in the next year are  estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars. Net receipts are estimated at  31.5 billion dollars. The estimated difference of 4.3 billion dollars will  be met by a reduction in the very substantial balance which will be in the  Treasury during the next fiscal year.    A large part of the activities outside defense and war liquidation,  aftermath of war, and international finance, classified as \"other  activities\" in a following table, is still due to repercussions of the war.  These \"other activities\" include more than 2 billion dollars for aids to  agriculture and net outlays for the Commodity Credit Corporation-almost  double the expenditures for the same purposes in prewar years. This  increase is due mainly to expenditures for purposes of price stabilization  and price support resulting from the war food production program. Other  increases in this category are due to the fact that certain wartime  agencies now in the process of liquidation are included in this group of  activities. If all expenditures for those activities which are directly or  indirectly related to the war are excluded, the residual expenditures are  below those for corresponding activities in prewar years. In making this  comparison account should be taken of the fact that, while prewar  expenditures were affected by direct relief and work relief for the  unemployed, the postwar budgets are affected by the considerable increase  in pay rates and other increases in costs and prices.    To elaborate, the Budget, as I have remarked above, reflects on both sides  of the ledger the Government's program as recommended by the Executive. It  includes estimates not only of expenditures and receipts for which  legislative authority already exists, but also of expenditures and receipts  for which authorization is recommended.    The Budget total for the next fiscal year, the year that ends on June 30,  1947, is estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars-about a third of the  budgets for global war, although nearly four times the prewar budgets. This  estimate is based on the assumption that a rapid liquidation of the war  program will be associated with rapid reconversion and expansion of  peacetime production. The total includes net outlays of Government  corporations.    The estimated expenditures in the next and current fiscal year compare as  follows with those of a year of global war and a prewar year:    Total Budget expenditures    Fiscal year: (in millions)    1947 $35, 860    1946 67,229    1945 100, 031    1940 9,252    Although allowances for occupation, demobilization, and defense are  drastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947, they will still amount to 42  percent of the total Budget. The so-called \"aftermath of war\" expenditures  account for a further 30 percent of the total. The total of all other  programs, which was drastically cut during the war, is increasing again as  liquidation of the war program proceeds and renewed emphasis is placed on  the peacetime objectives of the Government.    On the other side of the ledger, net receipts are estimated at 31.5 billion  dollars. This estimate assumes that"]]]
