Whereupon Dai-gu took  hold of him, and said: 'This ghostly good-for-nothing creature!  A  few minutes ago you came to me and complainingly asked what was wrong  with you, and now boldly declare that there is not much in the  Buddhism of Obak.  What is the reason of all this?  Speak out quick!  speak out quick!'  In response to this, Rin-zai softly struck three  times his fist at the ribs of Dai-gu.  The latter then released him,  saying: 'Your teacher is Obak, and I will have nothing to do with  you.'    \"Rin-zai took leave of Dai-gu and came back to Obak, who, on seeing  him come, exclaimed: 'Foolish fellow! what does it avail you to come  and go all the time like this?'  Rin-zai said: 'It is all due to your  doting kindness.'    \"When, after the usual salutation, Rin-zai stood by the side of Obak,  the latter asked him whence he had come this time.  Rin-zai answered:  \"In obedience to your kind instruction, I was with Dai-gu. Thence am  I come.'    And he related, being asked for further information, all that had  happened there.    \"Obak said: 'As soon as that fellow shows himself up here, I shall  have to give him a good thrashing.'  'You need not wait for him to  come; have it right this moment,' was the reply; and with this  Rin-zai gave his master a slap on the back.    \"Obak said: 'How dares this lunatic come into my presence and play  with a tiger's whiskers?'  Rin-zai then burst out into a Ho,[FN#85]  and Obak said: 'Attendant, come and carry this lunatic away to his  cell.'\"      [FN#85]  A loud outcry, frequently made use of by Zen teachers, after  Rin-zai. Its Chinese pronunciation is 'Hoh,' and pronounced 'Katsu'  in Japanese, but 'tsu' is not audible.        8. The Courage and the Composure of Mind of the Zen Monk and of the  Samurai.    Fourthly, our Samurai encountered death, as is well known, with  unflinching courage.  He would never turn back from, but fight till  his last with his enemy.  To be called a coward was for him the  dishonour worse than death itself.  An incident about Tsu Yuen  (So-gen), who came over to Japan in 1280, being invited by  Toki-mune[FN#86] (Ho-jo), the Regent General, well illustrates how  much Zen monks resembled our Samurais.  The event happened when he  was in China, where the invading army of Yuen spread terror all over  the country.  Some of the barbarians, who crossed the border of the  State of Wan, broke into the monastery of Tsu Yuen, and threatened to  behead him.  Then calmly sitting down, ready to meet his fate, he  composed the following verses    \"The heaven and earth afford me no shelter at all;  I'm glad, unreal are body and soul.  Welcome thy weapon, O warrior of Yuen! Thy trusty steel,  That flashes lightning, cuts the wind of Spring, I feel.\"      [FN#86]  A bold statesman and soldier, who was the real ruler of  Japan 1264-1283.      This reminds us of Sang Chao[FN#87] (So-jo), who, on the verge of  death by the vagabond's sword, expressed his feelings in the follow  lines:    \"In body there exists no soul.  The mind is not real at all.  Now try on me thy flashing steel,  As if it cuts the wind of Spring, I feel.\"      [FN#87]  The man was not a pure Zen master, being a disciple of  Kumarajiva, the founder of the San Ron Sect. This is a most  remarkable evidence that Zen, especially the Rin Zan school, was  influenced by Kumarajiva and his disciples. For the details of the  anecdote, see E-gen.      The barbarians, moved by this calm resolution and dignified air of  Tsu Yuen, rightly supposed him to be no ordinary personage, and left  the monastery, doing no harm to him.        9. Zen and the Regent Generals of the Ho-Jo Period.    No wonder, then, that the representatives of the Samurai class, the  Regent Generals, especially such able rulers as Toki-yori, Toki-mune,  and others noted for their good administration, of the Ho-jo period  (1205-1332) greatly favoured Zen.  They not only patronized the  faith, building great temples[FN#88] and inviting best Chinese Zen  teachers[FN#89] but also lived just as Zen monks, having the head  shaven, wearing a holy robe, and practising cross-legged Meditation.      [FN#88]  To-fuku-ji, the head temple of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai  under the same name, was built in 1243.  Ken-cho-ji, the head temple  of a subsect of the Rin Zai under the same name, was built in 1253.  En-gaku ji, the head temple of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the  same name, was built in 1282.  Nan-zen-ji, the head temple of a  sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the same name, was erected in 1326.    [FN#89]  Tao Lung (Do-ryu), known as Dai-kaku Zen-ji, invited by  Tokiyori, came over to Japan in 1246.  He became the founder of  Ken-cho-ji-ha, a sub-sect of the Rin Zai, and died in 1278.  Of his  disciples, Yaku-o was most noted, and Yaku-o's disciple, Jaku-shitsu,  became the founder of Yo-genji-ha, another sub-sect of the Rin Zai.  Tsu Yuen (So-gen), known as Buk-ko-koku-shi, invited by Toki-mune,  crossed the sea in 1280, became the founder of En-gaku-ji-ha (a  sub-sect of the Rin Zai), and died in 1286.  Tsing Choh (Sei-setsu),  invited by Taka-toki, came in 1327, and died in 1339.  Chu Tsun  (So-shun) came in 1331, and died in 1336.  Fan Sien (Bon-sen) came  together with Chu Tsun, and died in 1348.  These were the prominent  Chinese teachers of that time.      Toki-yori (1247-1263), for instance, who entered the monastic life  while be was still the real governor of the country, led as simple a  life, as is shown in his verse, which ran as follows:    \"Higher than its bank the rivulet flows;  Greener than moss tiny grass grows.  No one call at my humble cottage on the rock,  But the gate by itself opens to the Wind's knock.\"    Toki-yori attained to Enlightenment by the instruction of Do-gen and  Do-ryu, and breathed his last calmly sitting cross-legged, and  expressing his feelings in the following lines:    \"Thirty-seven of years,  Karma mirror stood high;  Now I break it to pieces,  Path of Great is then nigh.\"    His successor, Toki-mune (1264-1283), a bold statesman and soldier,  was no less of a devoted believer in Zen.  Twice he beheaded the  envoys sent by the great Chinese conqueror, Kublai, who demanded  Japan should either surrender or be trodden under his foot.  And when  the alarming news of the Chinese Armada's approaching the land  reached him, be is said to have called on his tutor, Tsu Yuen, to  receive the last instruction.  \"Now, reverend sir,\" said. he, \"an  imminent peril threatens the land.\"  \"How art thou going to encounter  it?\" asked the master.  Then Toki-mune burst into a thundering Ka  with all his might to show his undaunted spirit in encountering the  approaching enemy.  \"O, the lion's roar!\" said Tsu Yuen.    \"Thou art a genuine lion. Go, and never turn back.\"  Thus encouraged  by the teacher, the Regent General sent out the defending army, and  successfully rescued the state from the mouth of destruction, gaining  a splendid victory over the invaders, almost all of whom perished in  the western seas.        10. Zen after the Downfall of the Ho-Jo Regency.    Towards the end of the Ho-Jo period,[FN#90] and after the downfall of  the Regency in 1333, sanguinary battles were fought between the  Imperialists and the rebels.  The former, brave and faithful as they  were, being outnumbered by the latter, perished in the field one  after another for the sake of the ill-starred Emperor Go-dai-go  (1319-1338), whose eventful life ended in anxiety and despair.      [FN#90]  Although Zen was first favoured by the Ho-jo Regency and  chiefly prospered at Kama-kura, yet it rapidly began to exercise its  influence on nobles and Emperors at Kyo-to.  This is mainly due to  the activity of En-ni, known as Sho-Ichi-Koku-Shi (1202-1280), who  first earned Zen under Gyo-yu, a disciple of Ei-sai, and afterwards  went to China, where he was Enlightened under the instruction of Wu  Chun, of the monastery of King Shan.  After his return, Michi-iye  (Fuji-wara), a powerful nobleman, erected for him To-fuku-ji in 1243,  and he became the founder of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai, named after  that monastery.  The Emperor Go-saga (1243-1246), an admirer of his,  received the Moral Precepts from him.  One of his disciples, To-zan,  became the spiritual adviser of the Emperor Fushi-mi (1288-1298), and  another disciple, Mu kwan, was created the abbot of the monastery of  Nan-zen-ji by the Emperor Kame-yama (1260-1274), as the founder of a  sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the same name.    Another teacher who gained lasting influence on the Court is Nan-po,  known as Dai-O-Koku-Shi (1235-1308), who was appointed the abbot of  the monastery of Man-ju-ji in Kyo to by the Emperor Fushi-mi.  One of  his disciples, Tsu-o, was the spiritual adviser to both the Emperor  Hana-zono (1308-1318) and the Emperor Go-dai-go.  And another  disciple, Myo-cho, known as Dai-To-Koku-Shi (1282-1337), also was  admired by the two Emperors, and created the abbot of Dai-toku-ji, as  the founder of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the same name.  It was  for Myo-cho's disciple, Kan-zan (1277 1360), that the Emperor  Hana-zono turned his detached palace into a monastery, named  Myo-shin-ji, the head temple of a sub-sect of the Rin Zai under the  same name.      It was at this time that Japan gave birth to Masa-shige (Kusu-noki),  an able general and tactician of the Imperialists, who for the sake  of the Emperor not only sacrificed himself and his brother, but by  his will his son and his son's successor died for the same cause,  boldly attacking the enemy whose number was overwhelmingly great.  Masa-shige's loyalty, wisdom, bravery, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],[0,"The Enchanted Island of Yew (#11)"],[1,"of below it, and one was much higher  than the other.  And the nose, although small when compared to what it  had been, still resembled an elephant's trunk.  Other changes had been  made for the better, but Terribus was still exceedingly repulsive to  look upon.    Seeing the prince look at him and smile, the king flew into a fury of  anger and declared that the strangers should never, while they lived,  be permitted to leave his castle again.  Prince Marvel became  thoughtful at this, reflecting that the king's enmity all arose from  his sensitiveness about his ugly appearance, and this filled the  youthful knight with pity rather than resentment.    When they had all assembled at the evening banquet the prince, for a  third time, made a mystic pass at the king and whispered a magic word.  And behold! this time the charm was complete.  For the two front eyes  of Terribus fell into their proper places, his nose became straight and  well formed, and his skin took on a natural, healthy color.  Moreover,  he now had a fine head of soft brown hair, with eyebrows and eyelashes  to match, and his head was shapely and in proportion to his body.  As  for the eye that had formerly been in the back of his head, it had  disappeared completely.    So amazed were the subjects of the transformed king--who was now quite  handsome to look upon--that they began to murmur together excitedly,  and something in the new sensations he experienced gave to the king's  face likewise an expression of surprise.  Knowing from their pleased  looks that he must have improved in appearance, he found courage to  raise his hand to his nose, and found it well formed.  Then he touched  his eyes, and realized they were looking straight out from his face,  like those of other people.    For some moments after making these discoveries the king remained  motionless, a smile of joy gradually spreading over his features.  Then  he said, aloud:    \"What has happened?  Why do you all look so startled?\"    \"Your Majesty is no longer ugly,\" replied Marvel, laughingly; \"so that  when Nerle and I leave your kingdom we can proclaim nothing less than  praise of your dignified and handsome appearance.\"    \"Is my face indeed pleasing?\" demanded the king, eagerly.    \"It is!\" cried the assembled courtiers and ladies, as with one voice.    \"Bring me a mirror!\" said the king.  \"I shall look at my reflection for  the first time in many years.\"    The mirror being brought King Terribus regarded himself for a long time  with pleased astonishment; and then, his sensitive nature being  overcome by the shock of his good fortune, he burst into a flood of  tears and rushed from the room.    The courtiers and ladies now bestowed many grateful thanks upon Prince  Marvel for his kind deed; for they realized that thereafter their lives  would be safer from the king's anger and much pleasanter in every way.    \"Terribus is not bad by nature,\" said one; \"but he brooded upon his  ugliness so much that the least thing served to throw him into a  violent passion, and our lives were never safe from one day to another.\"    By and by two giants entered the hall and carried away the throne of  gray stone where Terribus had been accustomed to sit; and other slaves  brought a gorgeous throne of gold, studded with precious jewels, which  they put in its place.  And after a time the king himself returned to  the room, his simple gray gown replaced by flowing robes of purple,  with rich embroideries, such as he had not worn for many years.    \"My people,\" said he, addressing those present with kindness and  dignity, \"it seems to me fitting that a handsome king should be  handsomely attired, and an ugly one clothed simply.  For years I have  been so terrible in feature that I dared not even look at my own image  in a mirror.  But now, thanks to the gracious magic of my guest, I have  become like other men, and hereafter you will find my rule as kind as  it was formerly cruel.  To-night, in honor of this joyous occasion, we  shall feast and make merry, and it is my royal command that you all do  honor and reverence to the illustrious Prince Marvel!\"    A loud shout of approval greeted this speech, and the evening was merry  indeed.  Terribus joined freely in the revelry, laughing as gaily as  the lightest-hearted damsel present.    It was nearly morning before they all retired, and as they sought their  beds Nerle asked the prince in a voice that sounded like an ill-natured  growl:    \"Why did you give the king beauty, after his treatment of us?\"    Marvel looked at the reproachful face of his esquire and smiled.  \"When  you are older,\" said he, \"you will find that often there are many ways  to accomplish a single purpose.  The king's ugliness was the bar to our  leaving his country, for he feared our gossip.  So the easiest way for  us to compass our escape was to take away his reason for detaining us.  Thus I conquered the king in my own way, and at the same time gained  his gratitude and friendship.\"    \"Will he allow us to depart in the morning?\" inquired Nerle.    \"I think so,\" said Marvel.    It was late when they rose from their slumbers; but, having  breakfasted, the prince's first act was to seek the king.    \"We wish to leave your kingdom,\" said he.  \"Will you let us go?\"    Terribus grasped the hand of his guest and pressed it with fervor,  while tears of gratitude stood in his eyes.    \"I should prefer that you remain with me always, and be my friend,\" he  answered.  \"But if you choose to leave me I shall not interfere in any  way with your wishes.\"    Prince Marvel looked at him thoughtfully, and then said: \"My time on  this island is short.  In a few months Prince Marvel will have passed  out of the knowledge of men, and his name will be forgotten.  Before  then I hope to visit the Kingdoms of Dawna and Auriel and Plenta; so I  must not delay, but beg you will permit me to depart at once.\"    \"Very well,\" answered Terribus.  \"Come with me, and I shall show you  the way.\"    He led the prince and Nerle to a high wall of rock, and placing his  hand upon its rough surface, touched a hidden spring.  Instantly an  immense block of stone began to swing backward, disclosing a passage  large enough for a man on horseback to ride through.    \"This is the one road that leads out of my kingdom,\" said Terribus.  \"The others all begin and end at the castle.  So that unless you know  the secret of this passage you could never escape from Spor.\"    \"But where does this road lead?\" asked Marvel.    \"To the Kingdom of Auriel, which you desire to visit.  It is not a  straight road, for it winds around the Land of Twi, so it will carry  you a little out of your way.\"    \"What is the Land of Twi?\" inquired the prince.    \"A small country hidden from the view of all travelers,\" said Terribus.  \"No one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of Twi; yet there is  a rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the High Ki.\"    \"And does the rumor state what the High Ki of Twi is like?\"    \"No, indeed,\" returned the king, smiling, \"so it will do you no good to  be curious.  And now farewell, and may good luck attend you.  Yet bear  in mind the fact that King Terribus of Spor owes you a mighty debt of  gratitude; and if you ever need my services, you have but to call on  me, and I shall gladly come to your assistance.\"    \"I thank you,\" said Marvel, \"but there is small chance of my needing  help.  Farewell, and may your future life be pleasant and happy!\"    With this he sprang to the saddle of his prancing charger and, followed  by Nerle, rode slowly through the stone arch.  The courtiers and ladies  had flocked from the palace to witness their departure, and the giants  and dwarfs and Gray Men were drawn up in long lines to speed the king's  guests.  So it was a brilliant sight that Marvel and Nerle looked back  on; but once they were clear of the arch, the great stone rolled back  into its place, shutting them out completely from the Kingdom of Spor,  with its turreted castle and transformed king.        13.  The Hidden Kingdom of Twi    Knowing that at last they were free to roam according to their desire,  the travelers rode gaily along the paths, taking but scant heed of  their way.    \"Our faces are set toward new adventures,\" remarked the prince.  \"Let  us hope they will prove more pleasant than the last.\"    \"To be sure!\" responded Nerle.  \"Let us hope, at any rate, that we  shall suffer more privations and encounter more trouble than we did in  that mountainous Kingdom of Spor.\"  Then he added: \"For one reason, I  regret you are my master.\"    \"What is that reason?\" asked the prince, turning to smile upon his  esquire.    \"You have a way of overcoming all difficulties without any trouble  whatsoever, and that deprives me of any chance of coming to harm while  in your company.\"    \"Cheer up, my boy!\" cried Marvel.  \"Did I not say there are new  adventures before us?  We may not come through them so easily as we  came through the others.\"    \"That is true,\" replied Nerle; \"it is always best to hope.\" And then he  inquired: \"Why do you stop here, in the middle of the path?\"    \"Because the path has ended rather suddenly,\" answered Marvel.  \"Here  is a thick hedge of prickly briers barring our way.\"    Nerle looked over his master's shoulder and saw that a great hedge,  high and exceedingly thick, cut off all prospect of their advancing.    \"This is pleasant,\" said he; \"but I might try to force our way through  the hedge.  The briers would probably prick me severely, and that would  be delightful.\"    \"Try it!\" the prince returned, with twinkling eyes.    Nerle sprang from his horse to obey, but at the first contact with the  briers he uttered a howl of pain and held up his hands, which were  bleeding in a dozen places from the wounds of the thorns.    \"Ah, that will content you for a time, I trust,\" said Marvel.  \"Now  follow me, and we will ride along beside the hedge until we"]]]
