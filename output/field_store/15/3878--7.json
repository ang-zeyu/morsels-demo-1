[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],[0,"The Road to Oz (#11)"],[1,"be foolish and cowardly.\"    The Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway, turning first his white  side toward them and then his black side, as if he wanted to show to  all of his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners.  The  captives sat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the room--except  Polychrome, who danced back and forth in the little place to keep  herself warm, for she felt the chill of the cave.  Whenever she  approached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear, and  Polly would nod her pretty head as if she understood.    The shaggy man told Dorothy and Button-Bright to stand before him while  he emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks.  When this had been  secretly done, little Polychrome, dancing near to the guard, suddenly  reached out her hand and slapped his face, the next instant whirling  away from him quickly to rejoin her friends.    The angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the  Rainbow's Daughter; but the shaggy man was expecting that, and caught  the head very neatly, putting it in the sack, which he tied at the  mouth.  The body of the guard, not having the eyes of its head to guide  it, ran here and there in an aimless manner, and the shaggy man easily  dodged it and opened the door.  Fortunately, there was no one in the  big cave at that moment, so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as  they could for the entrance, and out across the narrow bridge.    \"I'll carry Button-Bright,\" he said, for he knew the little boy's legs  were too short to run fast.    Dorothy picked up Toto and then seized Polly's hand and ran swiftly  toward the entrance to the cave.  The shaggy man perched Button-Bright  on his shoulders and ran after them.  They moved so quickly and their  escape was so wholly unexpected that they had almost reached the bridge  when one of the Scoodlers looked out of his house and saw them.    The creature raised a shrill cry that brought all of its fellows  bounding out of the numerous doors, and at once they started in chase.  Dorothy and Polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the  Scoodlers began throwing their heads.  One of the queer missiles struck  the shaggy man on his back and nearly knocked him over; but he was at  the mouth of the cave now, so he set down Button-Bright and told the  boy to run across the bridge to Dorothy.    Then the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies, standing just  outside the opening, and as fast as they threw their heads at him he  caught them and tossed them into the black gulf below.  The headless  bodies of the foremost Scoodlers kept the others from running close up,  but they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping  prisoners.  The shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down  into the black gulf.  Among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head  of the Queen, and this he tossed after the others with right good will.    Presently every Scoodler of the lot had thrown its head, and every head  was down in the deep gulf, and now the helpless bodies of the creatures  were mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt  to discover what had become of their heads.  The shaggy man laughed and  walked across the bridge to rejoin his companions.    \"It's lucky I learned to play base-ball when I was young,\" he remarked,  \"for I caught all those heads easily and never missed one.  But come  along, little ones; the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else  any more.\"    Button-Bright was still frightened and kept insisting, \"I don't want to  be soup!\" for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy  could not realize they were free and safe.  But the shaggy man assured  him that all danger of their being made into soup was now past, as the  Scoodlers would be unable to eat soup for some time to come.    So now, anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as  possible, they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just  beyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers; and you may be  sure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again.          11.  Johnny Dooit Does It      \"It's getting awful rough walking,\" said Dorothy, as they trudged  along.  Button-Bright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry.  Indeed,  all were hungry, and thirsty, too; for they had eaten nothing but the  apples since breakfast; so their steps lagged and they grew silent and  weary.  At last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and  saw before them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their  feet.  An agreeable fragrance was wafted toward them.    Our travelers, hot and tired, ran forward on beholding this refreshing  sight and were not long in coming to the trees.  Here they found a  spring of pure bubbling water, around which the grass was full of wild  strawberry plants, their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat.  Some of the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears, so the  hungry adventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to  eat and to drink.  They lost no time in picking the biggest  strawberries and ripest oranges and soon had feasted to their hearts'  content.  Walking beyond the line of trees they saw before them a  fearful, dismal desert, everywhere gray sand.  At the edge of this  awful waste was a large, white sign with black letters neatly painted  upon it and the letters made these words:      ALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO VENTURE UPON THIS DESERT      For the Deadly Sands will Turn Any Living Flesh    to Dust in an instant.  Beyond This Barrier is the      LAND OF OZ      But no one can Reach that Beautiful Country    because of these Destroying Sands      \"Oh,\" said Dorothy, when the shaggy man had read the sign aloud; \"I've  seen this desert before, and it's true no one can live who tries to  walk upon the sands.\"    \"Then we musn't try it,\" answered the shaggy man thoughtfully.  \"But as  we can't go ahead and there's no use going back, what shall we do next?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Button-Bright.    \"I'm sure I don't know, either,\" added Dorothy, despondently.    \"I wish father would come for me,\" sighed the pretty Rainbow's  Daughter, \"I would take you all to live upon the rainbow, where you  could dance along its rays from morning till night, without a care or  worry of any sort.  But I suppose father's too busy just now to search  the world for me.\"    \"Don't want to dance,\" said Button-Bright, sitting down wearily upon  the soft grass.    \"It's very good of you, Polly,\" said Dorothy; \"but there are other  things that would suit me better than dancing on rainbows.  I'm 'fraid  they'd be kind of soft an' squashy under foot, anyhow, although they're  so pretty to look at.\"    This didn't help to solve the problem, and they all fell silent and  looked at one another questioningly.    \"Really, I don't know what to do,\" muttered the shaggy man, gazing hard  at Toto; and the little dog wagged his tail and said \"Bow-wow!\" just as  if he could not tell, either, what to do.  Button-Bright got a stick  and began to dig in the earth, and the others watched him for a while  in deep thought.  Finally, the shaggy man said:    \"It's nearly evening, now; so we may as well sleep in this pretty place  and get rested; perhaps by morning we can decide what is best to be  done.\"    There was little chance to make beds for the children, but the leaves  of the trees grew thickly and would serve to keep off the night dews,  so the shaggy man piled soft grasses in the thickest shade and when it  was dark they lay down and slept peacefully until morning.    Long after the others were asleep, however, the shaggy man sat in the  starlight by the spring, gazing thoughtfully into its bubbling waters.  Suddenly he smiled and nodded to himself as if he had found a good  thought, after which he, too, laid himself down under a tree and was  soon lost in slumber.    In the bright morning sunshine, as they ate of the strawberries and  sweet juicy pears, Dorothy said:    \"Polly, can you do any magic?\"    \"No dear,\" answered Polychrome, shaking her dainty head.    \"You ought to know SOME magic, being the Rainbow's Daughter,\" continued  Dorothy, earnestly.    \"But we who live on the rainbow among the fleecy clouds have no use for  magic,\" replied Polychrome.    \"What I'd like,\" said Dorothy, \"is to find some way to cross the desert  to the Land of Oz and its Emerald City.  I've crossed it already, you  know, more than once.  First a cyclone carried my house over, and some  Silver Shoes brought me back again--in half a second.  Then Ozma took  me over on her Magic Carpet, and the Nome King's Magic Belt took me  home that time.  You see it was magic that did it every time 'cept the  first, and we can't 'spect a cyclone to happen along and take us to the  Emerald City now.\"    \"No indeed,\" returned Polly, with a shudder, \"I hate cyclones, anyway.\"    \"That's why I wanted to find out if you could do any magic,\" said the  little Kansas girl.  \"I'm sure I can't; and I'm sure Button-Bright  can't; and the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet, which  won't help us much.\"    \"Don't be too sure of that, my dear,\" spoke the shaggy man, a smile on  his donkey face.  \"I may not be able to do magic myself, but I can call  to us a powerful friend who loves me because I own the Love Magnet, and  this friend surely will be able to help us.\"    \"Who is your friend?\" asked Dorothy.    \"Johnny Dooit.\"    \"What can Johnny do?\"    \"Anything,\" answered the shaggy man, with confidence.    \"Ask him to come,\" she exclaimed, eagerly.    The shaggy man took the Love Magnet from his pocket and unwrapped the  paper that surrounded it.  Holding the charm in the palm of his hand he  looked at it steadily and said these words:      \"Dear Johnny Dooit, come to me.    I need you bad as bad can be.\"      \"Well, here I am,\" said a cheery little voice; \"but you shouldn't say  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#11)"],[1,", have been enslaved by  the Nome King and are held prisoners in his underground palace.  Also  that there was no one in Ev powerful enough to release them.  Naturally  our Ozma wished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor  prisoners; but for a long time she could find no way to cross the great  desert between the two countries.  Finally she went to a friendly  sorceress of our land named Glinda the Good, who heard the story and at  once presented Ozma a magic carpet, which would continually unroll  beneath our feet and so make a comfortable path for us to cross the  desert.  As soon as she had received the carpet our gracious Ruler  ordered me to assemble our army, which I did.  You behold in these bold  warriors the pick of all the finest soldiers of Oz; and, if we are  obliged to fight the Nome King, every officer as well as the private,  will battle fiercely unto death.\"    Then Tiktok spoke.    \"Why should you fight the Nome King?\" he asked.  \"He has done no wrong.\"    \"No wrong!\" cried Dorothy.  \"Isn't it wrong to imprison a queen mother  and her ten children?\"    \"They were sold to the Nome King by King Ev-ol-do,\" replied Tiktok.  \"It was the King of Ev who did wrong, and when he re-al-ized what he  had done he jumped in-to the sea and drowned him-self.\"    \"This is news to me,\" said Ozma, thoughtfully.  \"I had supposed the  Nome King was all to blame in the matter.  But, in any case, he must be  made to liberate the prisoners.\"    \"My uncle Evoldo was a very wicked man,\" declared the Princess  Langwidere.  \"If he had drowned himself before he sold his family, no  one would have cared.  But he sold them to the powerful Nome King in  exchange for a long life, and afterward destroyed the life by jumping  into the sea.\"    \"Then,\" said Ozma, \"he did not get the long life, and the Nome King  must give up the prisoners.  Where are they confined?\"    \"No one knows, exactly,\" replied the Princess.  \"For the king, whose  name is Roquat of the Rocks, owns a splendid palace underneath the  great mountain which is at the north end of this kingdom, and he has  transformed the queen and her children into ornaments and bric-a-brac  with which to decorate his rooms.\"    \"I'd like to know,\" said Dorothy, \"who this Nome King is?\"    \"I will tell you,\" replied Ozma.  \"He is said to be the Ruler of the  Underground World, and commands the rocks and all that the rocks  contain.  Under his rule are many thousands of the Nomes, who are  queerly shaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces and  forges of their king, making gold and silver and other metals which  they conceal in the crevices of the rocks, so that those living upon  the earth's surface can only find them with great difficulty.  Also  they make diamonds and rubies and emeralds, which they hide in the  ground; so that the kingdom of the Nomes is wonderfully rich, and all  we have of precious stones and silver and gold is what we take from the  earth and rocks where the Nome King has hidden them.\"    \"I understand,\" said Dorothy, nodding her little head wisely.    \"For the reason that we often steal his treasures,\" continued Ozma,  \"the Ruler of the Underground World is not fond of those who live upon  the earth's surface, and never appears among us.  If we wish to see  King Roquat of the Rocks, we must visit his own country, where he is  all powerful, and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking.\"    \"But, for the sake of the poor prisoners,\" said Dorothy, \"we ought to  do it.\"    \"We shall do it,\" replied the Scarecrow, \"although it requires a lot of  courage for me to go near to the furnaces of the Nome King.  For I am  only stuffed with straw, and a single spark of fire might destroy me  entirely.\"    \"The furnaces may also melt my tin,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"but I am  going.\"    \"I can't bear heat,\" remarked the Princess Langwidere, yawning lazily,  \"so I shall stay at home.  But I wish you may have success in your  undertaking, for I am heartily tired of ruling this stupid kingdom, and  I need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful heads.\"    \"We do not need you,\" said Ozma.  \"For, if with the aid of my brave  followers I cannot accomplish my purpose, then it would be useless for  you to undertake the journey.\"    \"Quite true,\" sighed the Princess.  \"So, if you'll excuse me, I will  now retire to my cabinet.  I've worn this head quite awhile, and I want  to change it for another.\"    When she had left them (and you may be sure no one was sorry to see her  go) Ozma said to Tiktok:    \"Will you join our party?\"    \"I am the slave of the girl Dor-oth-y, who rescued me from pris-on,\"  replied the machine.  \"Where she goes I will go.\"    \"Oh, I am going with my friends, of course,\" said Dorothy, quickly.  \"I  wouldn't miss the fun for anything.  Will you go, too, Billina?\"    \"To be sure,\" said Billina in a careless tone.  She was smoothing down  the feathers of her back and not paying much attention.    \"Heat is just in her line,\" remarked the Scarecrow.  \"If she is nicely  roasted, she will be better than ever.\"    \"Then\" said Ozma, \"we will arrange to start for the Kingdom of the  Nomes at daybreak tomorrow.  And, in the meantime, we will rest and  prepare ourselves for the journey.\"    Although Princess Langwidere did not again appear to her guests, the  palace servants waited upon the strangers from Oz and did everything in  their power to make the party comfortable.  There were many vacant  rooms at their disposal, and the brave Army of twenty-seven was easily  provided for and liberally feasted.    The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were unharnessed from the  chariot and allowed to roam at will throughout the palace, where they  nearly frightened the servants into fits, although they did no harm at  all.  At one time Dorothy found the little maid Nanda crouching in  terror in a corner, with the Hungry Tiger standing before her.    \"You certainly look delicious,\" the beast was saying.  \"Will you kindly  give me permission to eat you?\"    \"No, no, no!\" cried the maid in reply.    \"Then,\" said the Tiger, yawning frightfully, \"please to get me about  thirty pounds of tenderloin steak, cooked rare, with a peck of boiled  potatoes on the side, and five gallons of ice-cream for dessert.\"    \"I--I'll do the best I can!\" said Nanda, and she ran away as fast as  she could go.    \"Are you so very hungry?\" asked Dorothy, in wonder.    \"You can hardly imagine the size of my appetite,\" replied the Tiger,  sadly.  \"It seems to fill my whole body, from the end of my throat to  the tip of my tail.  I am very sure the appetite doesn't fit me, and is  too large for the size of my body.  Some day, when I meet a dentist  with a pair of forceps, I'm going to have it pulled.\"    \"What, your tooth?\" asked Dorothy.    \"No, my appetite,\" said the Hungry Tiger.    The little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the Scarecrow  and the Tin Woodman, who related to her all that had taken place in the  Land of Oz since Dorothy had left it.  She was much interested in the  story of Ozma, who had been, when a baby, stolen by a wicked old witch  and transformed into a boy.  She did not know that she had ever been a  girl until she was restored to her natural form by a kind sorceress.  Then it was found that she was the only child of the former Ruler of  Oz, and was entitled to rule in his place.  Ozma had many adventures,  however, before she regained her father's throne, and in these she was  accompanied by a pumpkin-headed man, a highly magnified and thoroughly  educated Woggle-Bug, and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to  life by means of a magic powder.  The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had  also assisted her; but the Cowardly Lion, who ruled the great forest as  the King of Beasts, knew nothing of Ozma until after she became the  reigning princess of Oz.  Then he journeyed to the Emerald City to see  her, and on hearing she was about to visit the Land of Ev to set free  the royal family of that country, the Cowardly Lion begged to go with  her, and brought along his friend, the Hungry Tiger, as well.    Having heard this story, Dorothy related to them her own adventures,  and then went out with her friends to find the Sawhorse, which Ozma had  caused to be shod with plates of gold, so that its legs would not wear  out.    They came upon the Sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate,  but when Dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked  his eyes, which were knots of wood, and wagged his tail, which was only  the branch of a tree.    \"What a remarkable thing, to be alive!\" exclaimed Dorothy.    \"I quite agree with you,\" replied the Sawhorse, in a rough but not  unpleasant voice.  \"A creature like me has no business to live, as we  all know.  But it was the magic powder that did it, so I cannot justly  be blamed.\"    \"Of course not,\" said Dorothy.  \"And you seem to be of some use, 'cause  I noticed the Scarecrow riding upon your back.\"    \"Oh, yes; I'm of use,\" returned the Sawhorse; \"and I never tire, never  have to be fed, or cared for in any way.\"    \"Are you intel'gent?\" asked the girl.    \"Not very,\" said the creature.  \"It would be foolish to waste  intelligence on a common Sawhorse, when so many professors need it.  But I know enough to obey my masters, and to gid-dup, or whoa, when I'm  told to.  So I'm pretty well satisfied.\"    That night Dorothy slept in a pleasant little bed-chamber next to that  occupied by Ozma of Oz, and Billina perched upon the foot of the bed  and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that  position as did Dorothy upon her soft cushions.    But before daybreak every one was awake and stirring, and soon the  adventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great dining-room of  the palace.  Ozma sat at the head of a long table, on a raised  platform, with Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow on her left.  The Scarecrow did not eat, of course; but"]]]
