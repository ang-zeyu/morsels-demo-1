As with the  harvesting process, each technique employed in the winnowing  process is subject to limitations that can result in both  overblocking and underblocking.      First, simple key-word-based filters are subject to the  obvious limitation that no string of words can identify all sites  that contain sexually explicit content, and most strings of words  are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly  classified as containing sexually explicit content.  As noted  above, filtering software companies also use more sophisticated  automated classification systems for the statistical  classification of texts.  These systems assign weights to words  or other textual features and use algorithms to determine whether  a text belongs to a certain category.  These algorithms sometimes  make reference to the position of a word within a text or its  relative proximity to other words.  The weights are usually  determined by machine learning methods (often described as  \"artificial intelligence\").  In this procedure, which resembles  an automated form of trial and error, a system is given a  \"training set\" consisting of documents preclassified into two or  more groups, along with a set of features that might be  potentially useful in classifying the sets.  The system then  \"learns\" rules that assign weights to those features according to  how well they work in classification, and assigns each new  document to a category with a certain probability.  Notwithstanding their \"artificial intelligence\" description,  automated text classification systems are unable to grasp many  distinctions between types of content that would be obvious to a  human.  And of critical importance, no presently conceivable  technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether  a visual depiction fits the legal definitions of obscenity, child  pornography, or harmful to minors.  Finally, all the filtering software companies deposed in  this case use some form of human review in their process of  winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company  admitted to categorizing some Web pages without any human review.   SmartFilter states that \"the final categorization of every Web  site is done by a human reviewer.\"  Another filtering company  asserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the  \"work queue\" to be categorized each day, two to three percent of  those are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system  (which only applies to materials classified in the pornography  category), and the remainder are categorized by human review.  SurfControl also states that no URL is ever added to its database  without human review.      Human review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing more  nuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than automated  classification systems are capable of making, but suffers from  its own sources of error.  The filtering software companies  involved here have limited staff, of between eight and a few  dozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages.  The  reviewers that are employed by these companies base their  categorization decisions on both the text and the visual  depictions that appear on the sites or pages they are assigned to  review.  Human reviewers generally focus on English language Web  sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.  Given the speed at which human reviewers must work to keep  up with even a fraction of the approximately 1.5 million pages  added to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error is  inevitable.  Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of  attentiveness, overzealousness, or a desire to \"err on the side  of caution\" by screening out material that might be offensive to  some customers, even if it does not fit within any of the  company's category definitions.  None of the filtering companies  trains its reviewers in the legal definitions concerning what is  obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and none  instructs reviewers to take community standards into account when  making categorization decisions.      Perhaps because of limitations on the number of human  reviewers and because of the large number of new pages that are  added to the Web every day, filtering companies also widely  engage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the  \"root URL,\" rather than engaging in a more fine-grained analysis  of the individual pages within a Web site.  For example, the  filtering software companies deposed in this case all categorize  the entire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or  Pornography.  They do not differentiate between pages within the  site containing sexually explicit images or text, and for  example, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such as  the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians.  If the  \"root\" or \"top-level\" URL of a Web site is given a category tag,  then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if  the assigned category is enabled by a customer.  In some cases, whole Web sites are blocked because the  filtering companies focus only on the content of the home page  that is accessed by entering the root URL.  Entire Web sites  containing multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without  human review of each individual page on that site.  Web sites  that may contain multiple Web pages and that require  authentication or payment for access are commonly categorized  based solely on a human reviewer's evaluation of the pages that  may be viewed prior to reaching the authentication or payment  page.      Because there may be hundreds or thousands of pages under a  root URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission to  categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the  need arises or if there is time.  This form of overblocking is  called \"inheritance,\" because lower-level pages inherit the  categorization of the root URL without regard to their specific  content.  In some cases, \"reverse inheritance\" also occurs, i.e.,  parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level  of the site.  This might happen when pages with sexual content  appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual  content.  For example, N2H2's Bess filtering product classifies  every page in the Salon.com Web site, which contains a wide range  of news and cultural commentary, as \"Sex, Profanity,\" based on  the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals with  sexual issues.  Blocking by both domain name and IP address is another  practice in which filtering companies engage that is a function  both of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies of  dealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages.  The  category lists maintained by filtering software companies can  include URLs in either their human-readable domain name address  form, their numeric IP address form, or both.  Through \"virtual  hosting\" services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites with  distinct domain names may share a single numeric IP address.  To  the extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses of  virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a  substantial amount of content without reviewing it, and will  likely overblock a substantial amount of content.      Another technique that filtering companies use in order to  deal with a structural feature of the Internet is blocking the  root level URLs of so-called \"loophole\" Web sites.  These are Web  sites that provide access to a particular Web page, but display  in the user's browser a URL that is different from the URL with  which the particular page is usually associated.  Because of this  feature, they provide a \"loophole\" that can be used to get around  filtering software, i.e., they display a URL that is different  from the one that appears on the filtering company's control  list.  \"Loophole\" Web sites include caches of Web pages that have  been removed from their original location, \"anonymizer\" sites,  and translation sites.  Caches are archived copies that some search engines, such as  Google, keep of the Web pages they index.  The cached copy stored  by Google will have a URL that is different from the original  URL.  Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only  way to access pages that have been taken down, revised, or have  changed their URLs for some reason.  For example, a magazine  might place its current stories under a given URL, and replace  them monthly with new stories.  If a user wanted to find an  article published six months ago, he or she would be unable to  access it if not for Google's cached version.      Some sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary  between a user and another Web page.  When using a proxy server,  a user does not access the page from its original URL, but rather  from the URL of the proxy server.  One type of proxy service is  an \"anonymizer.\"  Users may access Web sites indirectly via an  anonymizer when they do not want the Web site they are visiting  to be able to determine the IP address from which they are  accessing the site, or to leave \"cookies\" on their browser.  Some proxy servers can be used to attempt to translate Web page  content from one language to another.  Rather than directly  accessing the original Web page in its original language, users  can instead indirectly access the page via a proxy server  offering translation features.  As noted above, filtering companies often block loophole  sites, such as caches, anonymizers, and translation sites.  The  practice of blocking loophole sites necessarily results in a  significant amount of overblocking, because the vast majority of  the pages that are cached, for example, do not contain content  that would match a filtering company's category definitions.  Filters that do not block these loophole sites, however, may  enable users to access any URL on the Web via the loophole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5183"],[0,"The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (#11)"],[1,"to the total abolition of war, but to the prevention of  such wars as are not waged for really vital material interests, and to  the abatement of the ferocities of warfare.    In the case of punishment for criminals he would similarly devote his  efforts not to the abrogation of punishments, but to the  relinquishment of any that are not reformatory, or really deterrent.    In like manner the reasonable reformer would not seek to prohibit the  slaughtering of animals for food, or the killing off of animal pests,  or the trapping, shooting, or hunting of animals for sport or profit,  nor yet would he seek to prevent their utilisation of animals for the  acquirement of knowledge.    He would direct his efforts to reducing the pain which is inflicted,  and to preserving everywhere measure and scale--not sentimentally  forbidding in connexion with one form of utilisation of animals what  is freely allowed in connexion with another--but differentiating, if  differentiating at all in favour of permitting the infliction of  proportionately greater suffering in the case where national and  humanitarian interests, than in the case where mere recreation and  luxury and personal profit, are at stake.    Having recognised what reason would prescribe to the legislative  reformer, we have next to inquire how far the man voter conforms to  these prescriptions of reason, and how far the woman reformer would do  so if she became a voter.    Let it be noted that the man in the street makes no question about  falling in with the fact that he is born into a world of violence, and  he acquiesces in the principle that the State, and, failing the State,  the individual, may employ force and take life in defence of vital  material interests. And he frankly falls in with it being a matter of  daily routine to kill and inflict suffering upon animals for human  profit or advantage.    Even if these principles are not formulated by the man in the street  in quite such plain terms, he not only carries them out in practice,  but he conducts all his thinking upon these presuppositions.    He, for instance, would fall in with the proposition that morality  does not require from man that he should give up taking life or  inflicting physical suffering. And he would not cavil with the  statement that man should put reasonable limits to the amount of  suffering he inflicts, and confine this within as narrow a range as  possible--always requiring for the death or suffering inflicted some  tangible advantage.    Moreover, if the question should be raised as to whether such  advantage will result, the ordinary man will as a rule, where the  matter lies beyond his personal ken, take expert opinion before  intervening.    He will, for instance, be prepared to be so guided in connexion with  such questions as whether disease could, if more knowledge were  available, be to a large extent prevented and cured; as to how far  animal experiments would contribute to the acquirement of that  knowledge; and as to how far the physical suffering which might be  involved in these experiments can be minimised or abolished. But not  every man is prepared to fall in with this programme of inflicting  physical suffering for the relief of physical suffering. There is also  a type of spiritually-minded man who in this world of violence sets  his face uncompromisingly against the taking of any life and the  infliction of any physical suffering--refusing to make himself a  partaker of evil.    An idealist of this type will, like Tolstoy, be an anti-militarist.  He will advocate a general gaol delivery for criminals. He will be a  vegetarian. He will not allow an animal's life to be taken in his  house, though the mice scamper over his floors. And he will,  consistently with his conviction that it is immoral to resort to  force, refuse to take any part in legislation or government.    This attitude, which is that commended by the Hindoo and the Buddhist  religions, is, of course, a quite unpractical attitude towards life.  It is, in fact, a self-destructive attitude, unless a man's  fellow-citizens are prepared by forcible means to secure to him the  enjoyment of the work of his hands or of his inherited property, or  unless those who refuse to desist from the exercise of force are  prepared to untake the support of idealists.    We have not only these two classes of men--the ordinary man who has no  compunction in resorting to force when the requirements of life demand  it, and the idealist who refuses to have any lot or part in violence;  there is also a hybrid. This male hybrid will descant on the general  iniquity of violence, and then not only connive at those forms of  violence which minister to his personal comforts, but also make a  virtue of trying to abate by legal violence some particular form of  physical suffering which happens to offend in a quite special manner  his individual sensibility.    There is absolutely nothing to be said about this kind of reforming  crank, except only that anything which may be said in relation to the  female legislative reformer may be appositely said of him; and perhaps  also this, that the ordinary man holds him both in intellectual and in  moral contempt, and is resolved not to allow him to do any really  serious injury to the community.    To become formidable this quasi-male person must, as he recognises,  ally himself with the female legislative reformer.    Passing on to deal with her, it imports us first to realise that while  the male voter has--except where important constitutional issues were  in question--been accustomed to leave actual legislation to the  expert, the female reformer gives notice beforehand that she will, as  soon as ever she gets the suffrage, insist on pressing forward by her  vote her reforming schemes.    What would result from the ordinary voter legislating on matters which  require expert knowledge will be plain to every one who will consider  the evolution of law.    There stand over against each other here, as an example and a warning,  the Roman Law, which was the creation of legal experts: the praetor  and the jurisconsult; and the legal system of the Greeks, which was  the creation of a popular assembly--and it was a popular assembly  which was quite ideally intelligent.    Upon the Roman Law has been built the law of the greater part of the  civilised world. The Greek is a by-word for inconsequence.    How can one, then, without cold shudders think of that legal system  which the female amateur legal reformer would bring to the birth?    Let us consider her qualifications.  Let us first take cognisance of  the fact that the reforming woman will neither stand to the principle  that man may, where this gives a balance of advantage, inflict on his  fellow-man, and _a fortiori_ upon animals, death and physical  suffering; nor yet will she stand to the principle that it is  ethically unlawful to do deeds of violence.    She spends her life halting between these two opinions, eternally  shilly-shallying.    She will, for instance, begin by announcing that it can never be  lawful to do evil that good may come; and that killing and inflicting  suffering is an evil. (In reality the precept of not doing evil that  good may come has relation only to breaking for idealistic purposes  moral laws of higher obligation.) She will then go back upon that and  concede that war may sometimes be lawful, and that the punishment of  criminals is not an evil. But if her emotions are touched by the  forcible feeding of a criminal militant suffragist, she will again go  back upon that and declare that the application of force is an  intolerable evil.    Or, again, she will concede that the slaughtering of animals for food  is not an evil, but that what is really unforgivable is the infliction  of physical suffering on animals. And all the time for her, as well as  for man, calves and lambs are being emasculated to make her meat  succulent; wild animals are painfully done to death to provide her  table with delicacies; birds with young in the nest are shot so that  she may parade in their plumage; or fur-bearing animals are for her  comfort and adornment massacred and tortured in traps.    When a man crank who is co-responsible for these things begins to talk  idealistic reforms, the ordinary decent man refuses to have anything  more to say to him.    But when a woman crank holds this language, the man merely shrugs his  shoulders. \"It is,\" he tells himself, \"after all, the woman whom God  gave him.\"    It must be confessed that the problem as to how man with a dual nature  may best accommodate himself to a world of violence presents a very  difficult problem.    It would obviously be no solution to follow out everywhere a programme  of violence. Not even the predatory animals do that. Tigers do not  savage their cubs; hawks do not pluck hawks' eyes; and dogs do not  fight bitches.    Nor would, as has been shown, the solution of the problem be arrived  at by everywhere surrendering--if we had been given the grace to do  this--to the compunctious visitings of nature.    What is required is to find the proper compromise.  As to what that  would be there is, as between the ordinary man and woman on the one  side, and the male crank and the battalions of sentimental women on  the other, a conflict which is, to all intents and purposes, a sex  war.    The compromise which ordinary human nature had fixed upon--and it is  one which, ministering as it does to the survival of the race, has  been adopted through the whole range of nature--is that of making  within the world in which violence rules a series of enclaves in which  the application of violence is progressively restricted and limited.    Outside the outermost of the series of ring fences thus constituted  would be the realm of uncompromising violence such as exists when  human life is endangered by wild animals, or murderous criminals, or  savages.
