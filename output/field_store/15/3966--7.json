Oh! it will pierce my soul like a  Sword--should I, a saint, meet him among the saints. In the midst of  heaven the horrors of hell will strike through me! The remembrance of  that deed will crush me in the presence of the Eternal: I have murdered  my son!    AMELIA. Oh, his smiles will chase away the bitter remembrance from your  soul! Cheer up, dear father! I am quite cheerful. Has he not already  sung the name of Amelia to listening angels on seraphic harps, and has  not heaven's choir sweetly echoed it? Was not his last sigh, Amelia?  And will not Amelia be his first accent of joy?    OLD MOOR. Heavenly consolation flows from your lips! He will smile  upon me, you say? He will forgive me? You must stay with my beloved  of my Charles, when I die.    AMELIA. To die is to fly to his arms. Oh, how happy and enviable is  your lot! Would that my bones were decayed!--that my hairs were gray!  Woe upon the vigor of youth! Welcome, decrepid age, nearer to heaven  and my Charles!                     Enter FRANCIS.    OLD MOOR. Come near, my son! Forgive me if I spoke too harshly to you  just now! I forgive you all. I wish to yield up my spirit in peace.    FRANCIS. Have you done weeping for your son? For aught that I see you  had but one.    OLD MOOR. Jacob had twelve sons, but for his Joseph he wept tears of  blood.    FRANCIS. Hum!    OLD MOOR. Bring the Bible, my daughter, and read to me the story of  Jacob and Joseph! It always appeared to me so touching, even before I  myself became a Jacob.    AMELIA. What part shall I read to you? (Takes the Bible and turns over  the leaves.)    OLD MOOR. Read to me the grief of the bereaved father, when he found  his Joseph no more among his children;--when he sought him in vain  amidst his eleven sons;--and his lamentation when he heard that he was  taken from him forever.    AMELIA (reads). \"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the  goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; and they sent the coat of many  colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, 'This have we  found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.' (Exit FRANCIS  suddenly.) And he knew it and said, 'It is my son's coat; an evil beast  hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.'\"    OLD MOOR (falls back upon the pillow). An evil beast hath devoured  Joseph!    AMELIA (continues reading). \"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put  sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. And all  his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to  be comforted, and he said, 'For I will go down into the grave--'\"    OLD MOOR. Leave off! leave off. I feel very ill.    AMELIA (running towards him, lets fall the book). Heaven help us! What  is this?    OLD MOOR. It is death--darkness--is waving--before my eyes--I pray  thee--send for the minister--that he may--give me--the Holy Communion.  Where is--my son Francis?    AMELIA. He is fled. God have mercy upon us!    OLD MOOR. Fled--fled from his father's deathbed? And is that all--all  --of two children full of promise--thou hast given--thou hast--taken  away--thy name be--    AMELIA (with a sudden cry). Dead! both dead!                           [Exit in despair.]                 Enter FRANCIS, dancing with joy.    FRANCIS. Dead, they cry, dead! Now am I master. Through the whole  castle it rings, dead! but stay, perchance he only sleeps? To be sure,  yes, to be sure! that certainly is a sleep after which no \"good-morrow\"  is ever said. Sleep and death are but twin-brothers. We will for once  change their names! Excellent, welcome sleep! We will call thee death!  (He closes the eyes of OLD MOOR.) Who now will come forward and dare to  accuse me at the bar of justice, or tell me to my face, thou art a  villain? Away, then, with this troublesome mask of humility and virtue!  Now you shall see Francis as he is, and tremble! My father was  overgentle in his demands, turned his domain into a family-circle, sat  blandly smiling at the gate, and saluted his peasants as brethren and  children. My brows shall lower upon you like thunderclouds; my lordly  name shall hover over you like a threatening comet over the mountains;  my forehead shall be your weather-glass! He would caress and fondle  the child that lifted its stubborn head against him. But fondling and  caressing is not my mode. I will drive the rowels of the spur into  their flesh, and give the scourge a trial. Under my rule it shall be  brought to pass that potatoes and small-beer shall be considered a  holiday treat; and woe to him who meets my eye with the audacious front  of health. Haggard want and crouching fear are my insignia; and in this  livery I will clothe ye.                              [Exit.]                    SCENE III.--THE BOHEMIAN WOODS.             SPIEGELBERG, RAZMAN, A Troop Of ROBBERS.      RAZ. Are you come? Is it really you? Oh, let me squeeze thee into a  jelly, my dear heart's brother! Welcome to the Bohemian forests! Why,  you are grown quite stout and jolly! You have brought us recruits in  right earnest, a little army of them; you are the very prince of crimps.    SPIEGEL. Eh, brother? Eli? And proper fellows they are! You must  confess the blessing of heaven is visibly upon me; I was a poor, hungry  wretch, and had nothing but this staff when I went over the Jordan, and  now there are eight-and-seventy of us, mostly ruined shopkeepers,  rejected masters of arts, and law-clerks from the Swabian provinces.  They are a rare set of fellows, brother, capital fellows, I promise you;  they will steal you the very buttons off each other's trousers in  perfect security, although in the teeth of a loaded musket,* and they  live in clover and enjoy a reputation for forty miles round, which is  quite astonishing.       *[The acting edition reads, \"Hang your hat up in the sun, and I'll     take you a wager it's gone the next minute, as clean out of sight     as if the devil himself had walked off with it.\"]    There is not a newspaper in which you will not find some little feat or  other of that cunning fellow, Spiegelberg; I take in the papers for  nothing else; they have described me from head to foot; you would think  you saw me; they have not forgotten even my coat-buttons. But we lead  them gloriously by the nose. The other day I went to the  printing-office and pretended that I had seen the famous Spiegelberg,  dictated to a penny-a-liner who was sitting there the exact image of a  quack doctor in the town; the matter gets wind, the fellow is arrested,  put to the rack, and in his anguish and stupidity he confesses the devil  take me if he does not--confesses that he is Spiegelberg. Fire and fury!  I was on the point of giving myself up to a magistrate rather than have  my fair fame marred by such a poltroon; however, within three months he  was hanged. I was obliged to stuff a right good pinch of snuff into my  nose as some time afterwards I was passing the gibbet and saw the  pseudo-Spiegelberg parading there in all his glory; and, while  Spiegelberg's representative is dangling by the neck, the real  Spiegelberg very quietly slips himself out of the noose, and makes jolly  long noses behind the backs of these sagacious wiseacres of the law.    RAZ. (laughing). You are still the same fellow you always were.    SPIEGEL. Ay, sure! body and soul. But I must tell you a bit of fun,  my boy, which I had the other day in the nunnery of St. Austin. We fell  in with the convent just about sunset; and as I had not fired a single  cartridge all day,--you know I hate the _diem perdidi_ as I hate death  itself,--I was determined to immortalize the night by some glorious  exploit, even though it should cost the devil one of his ears! We kept  quite quiet till late in the night. At last all is as still as a mouse  --the lights are extinguished. We fancy the nuns must be comfortably  tucked up. So I take brother Grimm along with me, and order the others  to wait at the gate till they hear my whistle--I secure the watchman,  take the keys from him, creep into the maid-servants' dormitory, take.  away all their clothes, and whisk the bundle out at the window. We go  on from cell to cell, take away the clothes of one sister after another,  and lastly those of the lady-abbess herself. Then I sound my whistle,  and my fellows outside begin to storm and halloo as if doomsday was at  hand, and away they rush with the devil's own uproar into the cells of  the sisters! Ha, ha, ha! You should have seen the game--how the poor  creatures were groping about in the dark for their petticoats, and how  they took on when they found they were gone; and we, in the meantime, at  'em like very devils; and now, terrified and amazed, they wriggled under  their bedclothes, or cowered together like cats behind the stoves.  There was such shrieking and lamentation; and then the old beldame of an  abbess--you know, brother, there is nothing in the world I hate so much  as a spider and an old woman--so you may just fancy that wrinkled old  hag standing naked before me, conjuring me by her maiden modesty  forsooth! Well, I was determined to make short work of it; either, said  I, out with your plate and your convent jewels and all your shining  dollars, or--my fellows knew what I meant. The end of it was I brought  away more than a thousand dollars' worth out of the convent, to say  nothing of the fun, which will tell its own story in due time.    RAZ. (stamping on the ground). Hang it, that I should be absent on  such an occasion.    SPIEGEL. Do you see? Now tell me, is not that life? 'Tis that which  keeps one fresh and hale, and braces the body so that it swells hourly  like an abbot's paunch; I don't know, but I think I must be endowed with  some magnetic property, which attracts all the vagabonds on the face of  the earth towards me like steel and iron."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],[0,"Wilhelm Tell (#11)"],[1,"is all the monarch's--bird and beast.

He is the man who fosters and protects them.    WALTER.  Have they not courage to protect themselves?    TELL.  The neighbor there dare not his neighbor trust.    WALTER.  I should want breathing room in such a land,  I'd rather dwell beneath the avalanches.    TELL.  'Tis better, child, to have these glacier peaks  Behind one's back than evil-minded men!

Wherefore do ye stop my path?    FRIESSHARDT.  You've broke the mandate, and must go with us.    LEUTHOLD.  You have not done obeisance to the cap.    TELL.  Friend, let me go.    FRIESSHARDT.            Away, away to prison!    WALTER.  Father to prison! Help!     [Calling to the side scene.               This way, you men!  Good people, help! They're dragging him to prison!       [ROSSELMANN, the priest, and the SACRISTAN, with     three other men, enter.    SACRISTAN.  What's here amiss?    ROSSELMANN.            Why do you seize this man?    FRIESSHARDT.  He is an enemy of the king--a traitor!    TELL (seizing him with violence).  A traitor, I!    ROSSELMANN.          Friend, thou art wrong. 'Tis Tell,  An honest man, and worthy citizen.    WALTER (descries FURST, and runs up to him).  Grandfather, help! they want to seize my father!    FRIESSHARDT.  Away to prison!    FURST (running in).           Stay! I offer bail.  For God's sake, Tell, what is the matter here?       [MELCHTHAL and STAUFFACHER enter.    LEUTHOLD.  He has contemned the viceroy's sovereign power,  Refusing flatly to acknowledge it.    STAUFFACHER.  Has Tell done this?    MELCHTHAL.             Villain, thou knowest 'tis false!    LEUTHOLD.  He has not made obeisance to the cap.    FURST.  And shall for this to prison? Come, my friend,  Take my security, and let him go.    FRIESSHARDT.  Keep your security for yourself--you'll need it.  We only do our duty. Hence with him.    MELCHTHAL (to the country people).  This is too bad--shall we stand by, and see them.  Drag him away before our very eyes?    SACRISTAN.  We are the strongest. Don't endure it, friends.  Our countrymen will back us to a man.    FRIESSHARDT.  Who dares resist the governor's commands?    OTHER THREE PEASANTS (running in).  We'll help you. What's the matter? Down with them!       [HILDEGARD, MECHTHILD, and ELSBETH return.    TELL.  Go, go, good people, I can help myself.  Think you, had I a mind to use my strength,  These pikes of theirs should daunt me?    MELCHTHAL (to FRIESSHARDT).                       Only try--  Try, if you dare, to force him from amongst us.    FURST and STAUFFACHER.  Peace, peace, friends!    FRIESSHARDT (loudly).              Riot! Insurrection, ho!       [Hunting horns without.    WOMEN.  The governor!    FRIESSHARDT (raising his voice).          Rebellion! Mutiny!    STAUFFACHER.  Roar, till you burst, knave!    ROSSELMANN and MELCHTHAL.                 Will you hold your tongue?    FRIESSHARDT (calling still louder).  Help, help, I say, the servants of the law!    FURST.  The viceroy here! Then we shall smart for this!       [Enter GESSLER on horseback, with a falcon on his wrist;     RUDOLPH DER HARRAS, BERTHA, and RUDENZ, and a numerous     train of armed attendants, who form a circle of lances     around the whole stage.    HARRAS.  Room for the viceroy!    GESSLER.              Drive the clowns apart.  Why throng the people thus? Who calls for help?       [General silence.    Who was it? I will know.       [FRIESSHARDT steps forward.                  And who art thou?  And why hast thou this man in custody?       [Gives his falcon to an attendant.    FRIESSHARDT.  Dread sir, I am a soldier of your guard,  And stationed sentinel beside the cap;  This man I apprehended in the act  Of passing it without obeisance due,  So I arrested him, as you gave order,  Whereon the people tried to rescue him.    GESSLER (after a pause).  And do you, Tell, so lightly hold your king,  And me, who act as his vicegerent here,  That you refuse the greeting to the cap  I hung aloft to test your loyalty?  I read in this a disaffected spirit.    TELL.  Pardon me, good my lord! The action sprung  From inadvertence,--not from disrespect.  Were I discreet, I were not William Tell.  Forgive me now--I'll not offend again.    GESSLER (after a pause).  I hear, Tell, you're a master with the bow,--  And bear the palm away from every rival.    WALTER.  That must be true, sir! At a hundred yards  He'll shoot an apple for you off the tree.    GESSLER.  Is that boy thine, Tell?    TELL.                Yes, my gracious lord.    GESSLER.  Hast any more of them?    TELL.               Two boys, my lord.    GESSLER.  And, of the two, which dost thou love the most?    TELL.  Sir, both the boys are dear to me alike.    GESSLER.  Then, Tell, since at a hundred yards thou canst  Bring down the apple from the tree, thou shalt  Approve thy skill before me. Take thy bow--  Thou hast it there at hand--and make thee ready  To shoot an apple from the stripling's head!  But take this counsel,--look well to thine aim,  See that thou hittest the apple at the first,  For, shouldst thou miss, thy head shall pay the forfeit.       [All give signs of horror.    TELL.  What monstrous thing, my lord, is this you ask?  That I, from the head of mine own child!--No, no!  It cannot be, kind sir, you meant not that--  God in His grace forbid! You could not ask  A father seriously to do that thing!    GESSLER.  Thou art to shoot an apple from his head!  I do desire--command it so.    TELL.                 What, I!  Level my crossbow at the darling head  Of mine own child? No--rather let me die!    GESSLER.  Or thou must shoot, or with thee dies the boy.    TELL.  Shall I become the murderer of my child!  You have no children, sir--you do not know  The tender throbbings of a father's heart.    GESSLER.  How now, Tell, so discreet upon a sudden  I had been told thou wert a visionary,--  A wanderer from the paths of common men.  Thou lovest the marvellous. So have I now  Culled out for thee a task of special daring.  Another man might pause and hesitate;  Thou dashest at it, heart and soul, at once.    BERTHA.  Oh, do not jest, my lord, with these poor souls!  See, how they tremble, and how pale they look,  So little used are they to hear thee jest.    GESSLER.  Who tells thee that I jest?       [Grasping a branch above his head.                   Here is the apple.  Room there, I say! And let him take his distance--  Just eighty paces-as the custom is  Not an inch more or less! It was his boast,  That at a hundred he could hit his man.  Now, archer, to your task, and look you miss not!    HARRAS:  Heavens! this grows serious--down, boy, on your knees,  And beg the governor to spare your life.    FURST (aside to MELCHTHAL, who can scarcely restrain his impatience).  Command yourself--be calm, I beg of you!    BERTHA (to the governor).  Let this suffice you, sir! It is inhuman  To trifle with a father's anguish thus.  Although this wretched man had forfeited  Both life and limb for such a slight offence,  Already has he suffered tenfold death.  Send him away uninjured to his home;  He'll know thee well in future; and this hour  He and his children's children will remember.    GESSLER.  Open a way there--quick! Why this delay?  Thy life is forfeited; I might despatch thee,  And see I graciously repose thy fate  Upon the skill of thine own practised hand.  No cause has he to say his doom is harsh,  Who's made the master of his destiny.  Thou boastest of thy steady eye. 'Tis well!  Now is a fitting time to show thy skill.  The mark is worthy, and the prize is great.  To hit the bull's-eye in the target; that  Can many another do as well as thou;  But he, methinks, is master of his craft  Who can at all times on his skill rely,  Nor lets his heart disturb or eye or hand.    FURST.  My lord, we bow to your authority;  But, oh, let justice yield to mercy here.  Take half my property, nay, take it all,  But spare a father this unnatural doom!    WALTER.  Grandfather, do not kneel to that bad man!  Say, where am I to stand? I do not fear;  My father strikes the bird upon the wing,  And will not miss now when 'twould harm his boy!    STAUFFACHER.  Does the child's innocence not touch your heart?    ROSSELMANN.  Bethink you, sir, there is a God in heaven,  To whom you must account for all your deeds.    GESSLER (pointing to the boy).  Bind him to yonder lime tree straight!    WALTER.  Bind me? No, I will not be bound! I will be still,  Still as a lamb--nor even draw my breath!  But if you bind me I cannot be still.  Then I shall writhe and struggle with my bonds.    HARRAS.  But let your eyes at least be bandaged, boy!    WALTER.  And why my eyes? No! Do you think I fear  An arrow from my father's hand? Not I!  I'll wait it firmly, nor so much as wink!  Quick, father, show them that thou art an archer!  He doubts thy skill--he thinks to ruin us.  Shoot then and hit though but to spite the tyrant!       [He goes to the lime tree, and an apple is placed on his head.    MELCHTHAL (to the country people).  What! Is this outrage to be perpetrated  Before our very eyes? Where is our oath?    STAUFFACHER.  'Tis all in vain. We have no weapons here;  And see the wood of lances that surrounds us!    MELCHTHAL.  Oh! would to heaven that we had struck at once!  God pardon those who counselled the delay!    GESSLER (to TELL).  Now, to thy task! Men bear not arms for naught.  'Tis dangerous to carry deadly weapons,  And on the archer oft his"]]]
