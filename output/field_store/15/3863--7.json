If we are not tall enough to  touch the giant's knees, that is no reason why we should become shorter  by falling on our own. But that is at bottom the meaning of all modern  hero-worship and celebration of the Strong Man, the Caesar the  Superman. That he may be something more than man, we must be something  less.    Doubtless there is an older and better hero-worship than this. But the  old hero was a being who, like Achilles, was more human than humanity  itself.  Nietzsche's Superman is cold and friendless. Achilles is so  foolishly fond of his friend that he slaughters armies in the agony of  his bereavement.  Mr. Shaw's sad Caesar says in his desolate pride, \"He  who has never hoped can never despair.\" The Man-God of old answers from  his awful hill, \"Was ever sorrow like unto my sorrow?\"  A great man is  not a man so strong that he feels less than other men; he is a man so  strong that he feels more. And when Nietszche says, \"A new commandment  I give to you, 'be hard,'\" he is really saying, \"A new commandment I  give to you, 'be dead.'\" Sensibility is the definition of life.    I recur for a last word to Jack the Giant-Killer. I have dwelt on this  matter of Mr. Wells and the giants, not because it is specially  prominent in his mind; I know that the Superman does not bulk so large  in his cosmos as in that of Mr. Bernard Shaw. I have dwelt on it for  the opposite reason; because this heresy of immoral hero-worship has  taken, I think, a slighter hold of him, and may perhaps still be  prevented from perverting one of the best thinkers of the day.  In the  course of \"The New Utopia\" Mr. Wells makes more than one admiring  allusion to Mr. W. E. Henley. That clever and unhappy man lived in  admiration of a vague violence, and was always going back to rude old  tales and rude old ballads, to strong and primitive literatures, to  find the praise of strength and the justification of tyranny.  But he  could not find it. It is not there.  The primitive literature is shown  in the tale of Jack the Giant-Killer. The strong old literature is all  in praise of the weak. The rude old tales are as tender to minorities  as any modern political idealist.  The rude old ballads are as  sentimentally concerned for the under-dog as the Aborigines Protection  Society. When men were tough and raw, when they lived amid hard knocks  and hard laws, when they knew what fighting really was, they had only  two kinds of songs.  The first was a rejoicing that the weak had  conquered the strong, the second a lamentation that the strong had, for  once in a way, conquered the weak.  For this defiance of the statu quo,  this constant effort to alter the existing balance, this premature  challenge to the powerful, is the whole nature and inmost secret of the  psychological adventure which is called man. It is his strength to  disdain strength.  The forlorn hope is not only a real hope, it is the  only real hope of mankind. In the coarsest ballads of the greenwood men  are admired most when they defy, not only the king, but what is more to  the point, the hero. The moment Robin Hood becomes a sort of Superman,  that moment the chivalrous chronicler shows us Robin thrashed by a poor  tinker whom he thought to thrust aside.  And the chivalrous chronicler  makes Robin Hood receive the thrashing in a glow of admiration. This  magnanimity is not a product of modern humanitarianism; it is not a  product of anything to do with peace. This magnanimity is merely one of  the lost arts of war. The Henleyites call for a sturdy and fighting  England, and they go back to the fierce old stories of the sturdy and  fighting English. And the thing that they find written across that  fierce old literature everywhere, is \"the policy of Majuba.\"        VI.  Christmas and the Aesthetes    The world is round, so round that the schools of optimism and pessimism  have been arguing from the beginning whether it is the right way up.  The difficulty does not arise so much from the mere fact that good and  evil are mingled in roughly equal proportions; it arises chiefly from  the fact that men always differ about what parts are good and what  evil. Hence the difficulty which besets \"undenominational religions.\"  They profess to include what is beautiful in all creeds, but they  appear to many to have collected all that is dull in them. All the  colours mixed together in purity ought to make a perfect white. Mixed  together on any human paint-box, they make a thing like mud, and a  thing very like many new religions.  Such a blend is often something  much worse than any one creed taken separately, even the creed of the  Thugs. The error arises from the difficulty of detecting what is really  the good part and what is really the bad part of any given religion.  And this pathos falls rather heavily on those persons who have the  misfortune to think of some religion or other, that the parts commonly  counted good are bad, and the parts commonly counted bad are good.    It is tragic to admire and honestly admire a human group, but to admire  it in a photographic negative.  It is difficult to congratulate all  their whites on being black and all their blacks on their whiteness.  This will often happen to us in connection with human religions. Take  two institutions which bear witness to the religious energy of the  nineteenth century.  Take the Salvation Army and the philosophy of  Auguste Comte.    The usual verdict of educated people on the Salvation Army is expressed  in some such words as these:  \"I have no doubt they do a great deal of  good, but they do it in a vulgar and profane style; their aims are  excellent, but their methods are wrong.\" To me, unfortunately, the  precise reverse of this appears to be the truth.  I do not know whether  the aims of the Salvation Army are excellent, but I am quite sure their  methods are admirable. Their methods are the methods of all intense and  hearty religions; they are popular like all religion, military like all  religion, public and sensational like all religion.  They are not  reverent any more than Roman Catholics are reverent, for reverence in  the sad and delicate meaning of the term reverence is a thing only  possible to infidels. That beautiful twilight you will find in  Euripides, in Renan, in Matthew Arnold; but in men who believe you will  not find it--you will find only laughter and war.  A man cannot pay  that kind of reverence to truth solid as marble; they can only be  reverent towards a beautiful lie.  And the Salvation Army, though their  voice has broken out in a mean environment and an ugly shape, are  really the old voice of glad and angry faith, hot as the riots of  Dionysus, wild as the gargoyles of Catholicism, not to be mistaken for  a philosophy. Professor Huxley, in one of his clever phrases, called  the Salvation Army \"corybantic Christianity.\"  Huxley was the last and  noblest of those Stoics who have never understood the Cross.  If he had  understood Christianity he would have known that there never has been,  and never can be, any Christianity that is not corybantic.    And there is this difference between the matter of aims and the matter  of methods, that to judge of the aims of a thing like the Salvation  Army is very difficult, to judge of their ritual and atmosphere very  easy.  No one, perhaps, but a sociologist can see whether General  Booth's housing scheme is right. But any healthy person can see that  banging brass cymbals together must be right.  A page of statistics, a  plan of model dwellings, anything which is rational, is always  difficult for the lay mind. But the thing which is irrational any one  can understand. That is why religion came so early into the world and  spread so far, while science came so late into the world and has not  spread at all. History unanimously attests the fact that it is only  mysticism which stands the smallest chance of being understanded of the  people. Common sense has to be kept as an esoteric secret in the dark  temple of culture.  And so while the philanthropy of the Salvationists  and its genuineness may be a reasonable matter for the discussion of  the doctors, there can be no doubt about the genuineness of their brass  bands, for a brass band is purely spiritual, and seeks only to quicken  the internal life.  The object of philanthropy is to do good; the  object of religion is to be good, if only for a moment, amid a crash of  brass.    And the same antithesis exists about another modern religion--I mean  the religion of Comte, generally known as Positivism, or the worship of  humanity.  Such men as Mr. Frederic Harrison, that brilliant and  chivalrous philosopher, who still, by his mere personality, speaks for  the creed, would tell us that he offers us the philosophy of Comte, but  not all Comte's fantastic proposals for pontiffs and ceremonials, the  new calendar, the new holidays and saints' days. He does not mean that  we should dress ourselves up as priests of humanity or let off  fireworks because it is Milton's birthday. To the solid English Comtist  all this appears, he confesses, to be a little absurd.  To me it  appears the only sensible part of Comtism. As a philosophy it is  unsatisfactory.  It is evidently impossible to worship humanity, just  as it is impossible to worship the Savile Club; both are excellent  institutions to which we may happen to belong. But we perceive clearly  that the Savile Club did not make the stars and does not fill the  universe.  And it is surely unreasonable to attack the doctrine of the  Trinity as a piece of bewildering mysticism, and then to ask men to  worship a being who is ninety million persons in one God, neither  confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.    But if the wisdom of Comte was insufficient, the folly of Comte was  wisdom.  In an age of dusty modernity, when beauty was thought of as  something barbaric and ugliness as something sensible, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F. Smith (#11)"],[1,"phets. He was the inspirer of the ancient philosophers,  Pagan or Israelite, as well as of the great characters of modern times.  Columbus, in discovery; Washington, in the struggle for freedom;  Lincoln, in emancipation and union; Bacon, in philosophy; Franklin,  in statesmanship and diplomacy; Stephenson, in steam; Watts, in song;  Edison, in electricity, and Joseph Smith, in theology and religion,  found in Christ the source of their wisdom and the marvelous truths  which they advocated.    Calvin, Luther, Melanchthon, and all the reformers, were inspired in  thoughts, words, and actions, to accomplish what they did for the  amelioration, liberty and advancement of the human race. They paved the  way for the more perfect gospel of truth to come. Their inspiration,  as with that of the ancients, came from the Father, his Son Jesus  Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the one true and living God. This may also  truthfully be said concerning the Revolutionary fathers of this nation,  and all who have in the ages past contributed to the progress of civil  and religious freedom. There is no light nor truth which did not come  to them first from him. Men are mere repeaters of what he has taught  them. He has voiced no thoughts originating with man. The teachings  of Jesus did not begin with his incarnation; for, like truth, he is  eternal. He not only inspired the ancients, from the beginning, but  when he came to earth he reiterated eternal, original truth, and added  gloriously to the revelations men had uttered. When he returned to the  Father he still took and does take an interest in his children and  people, by revealing to them new truths, and by inspiring their {40}  actions; and, as men grow in the knowledge of God, they shall become  more and more like him unto the perfect day, when his knowledge shall  cover the earth as the waters cover the deep.    It is folly, therefore, to discredit the Savior on the grounds that he  has uttered nothing new; for, with the Father and the Spirit, he is the  author of that which persists--the truth--that which has been, that  which is, and that which will continue forever.--_Improvement Era,_  Vol. 10, pp. 627-630, 1906-7.    ETERNITY OF THE SPIRIT OF MAN. Again, where are we going? We come here  and sojourn in the flesh a little season and then we pass away. Every  soul that is born into the world will die. There is not a soul that has  escaped death, except those upon whom God has passed, by the power of  his Spirit, that they should live in the flesh until the second coming  of the Son of Man; but they will eventually have to pass through the  ordeal called death; it may be in the twinkling of an eye, and without  pain or suffering; but they will pass through the change, because it  is an irrevocable edict of the Almighty. \"In the day that thou eatest  thereof thou shalt surely die.\" This was the edict of the Almighty and  it pertains to Adam--that is, all the human race; for Adam is many,  and it means you and me and every soul that lives and that bears the  image of the Father. We shall all die. But is that the end of our  being? If we had an existence before we came here we certainly shall  continue that existence when we leave here. The spirit will continue  to exist as it did before, with the additional advantages derived from  having passed through this probation. It is absolutely necessary that  we should come to the earth and take upon us tabernacles; because if  we did not have tabernacles we could not be like God, or like Jesus  Christ. God has a tabernacle of flesh and bone. He is an organized  being just as we are who are now in the flesh. Jesus Christ {41} was  born of his mother, Mary. He had a fleshly tabernacle; he was crucified  on the cross, and his body was raised from the dead. He burst the bonds  of the grave and came forth to newness of life, a living soul, living  being, a man with a body, and with parts and with spirit--the spirit  and the body becoming a living and immortal soul. You and I have got  to do the same thing. We must go through the same ordeal in order  to attain to the glory and exaltation which God designed we should  enjoy with him in the eternal worlds. In other words, we must become  like him; peradventure to sit upon thrones, to have dominion, power  and eternal increase. God designed this in the beginning. We are the  children of God. He is an eternal being, without beginning of days or  end of years. He always was, he is, he always will be. We are precisely  in the same condition and under the same circumstances that God our  heavenly Father was when he was passing through this or a similar  ordeal. We are destined to come forth out of the grave as Jesus did,  and to obtain immortal bodies as he did--that is, that our tabernacles  are to become immortal as his became immortal, that the spirit and the  body may be joined together and become one living being, indivisible,  inseparable, eternal.--_Deseret Weekly News,_ Vol. 33, pp. 130, 131.    PURPOSE OF THE ALMIGHTY UNCHANGEABLE. The purposes of the Almighty  are unchanged and unchangeable. His laws endure, and he is the  same yesterday, today and forever. His purposes will ripen and be  consummated and his designs be completed. Therefore, if we do not  conform to his will, obey his laws and yield to his requirements in  this world, we will be consigned to the \"prison house,\" where we will  remain until we pay the debt to the uttermost farthing.--_Deseret  Weekly News,_ Vol. 24, 1875, p. 708.    {42}        CHAPTER III    REVELATION    VALUE OF THE SPIRIT OF REVELATION. The man who possesses the spirit of  revelation can realize whether he is a sinner, whether he is prone to  evil, whether he is magnifying his standing before the Lord, or not,  better than a man who has not the Spirit of the Lord in him, can he  not?--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1912, p. 7.    THE SPIRIT OF--INSPIRATION OF REVELATION--BY WHOM ENJOYED. And the  spirit of inspiration, the gift of revelation, does not belong to  one man solely; it is not a gift that pertains to the Presidency of  the Church and the Twelve apostles alone. It is not confined to the  presiding authorities of the Church, it belongs to every individual  member of the Church; and it is the right and privilege of every  man, every woman, and every child who has reached the years of  accountability, to enjoy the spirit of revelation, and to be possessed  of the spirit of inspiration in the discharge of their duties as  members of the Church. It is the privilege of every individual  member of the Church to have revelation for his own guidance, for  the direction of his life and conduct; and therefore I aver--and  I believe I may do so without any reasonable chance for it being  gainsaid or opposed that there is not another church in the world, or  an organization of religious people, who are so universally spiritual  in their lives, and who are so universally entitled to the gifts of  the Spirit of God as are the members of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. You are all entitled to revelation. It is your  privilege to have it revealed to you whether I am a servant of God or  a servant of men; whether I am in the discharge of my duty or not;  whether I, as a {43} presiding officer in the Church, am acting in  the discharge of my duty acceptable to you and the Lord. It is your  privilege to have revelation in regard to this, and to know the truth  yourselves. And it is my privilege to have revelation from God, as an  individual, for my own temporal guidance, and I repeat again that there  never was a time on the earth, since the Church was organized, when the  spirituality of the people of God was greater than it is today.--_Apr  C. R.,_ 1912, p. 5.    THE SPIRIT OF REVELATION ENJOYED BY ALL. I believe that every  individual in the Church has just as much right to enjoy the spirit  of revelation and the understanding from God which that spirit of  revelation gives him, for his own good, as the bishop has to enable  him to preside over his ward. Every man has the privilege to exercise  these gifts and these privileges in the conduct of his own affairs,  in bringing up his children in the way they should go, and in the  management of his farm, his flocks, his herds, and in the management of  his business, if he has business of other kinds to do; it is his right  to enjoy the spirit of revelation and of inspiration to do the right  thing, to be wise and prudent, just and good in everything that he  does. I know that this is a true principle, and I know that I know it,  too; and that is the thing that I would like the Latter-day Saints to  know.--_Apr. C. R.,_ 1912, pp. 9, 10.    NEW REVELATION. So far as I know there is not an ordinance of the  Church now enjoyed or practiced that was not revealed to the Church  by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I know of no new doctrine that has been  revealed. Principles that were revealed to the Prophet Joseph have  grown and developed more fully and clearly to the understanding; but  we have received nothing new that I know of. Yet, if we should receive  something new, through the proper channels of the Church, we should be  as ready and willing to receive it as we were, or would be, to receive  the same at {44} the hands of the Prophet Joseph himself.--_Oct. C.  R.,_ 1900, p. 47.    WHEN TO EXPECT NEW REVELATION. We have nothing that is not in common  with the Latter-day Saints. We know nothing, and we will preach nothing  to the people except that which the Lord God has revealed, and we  advise and counsel those who are in authority, and whose duty and  business it is to teach and preach the principles of the gospel to the  world and to the Latter-day Saints, to confine their teachings and  their instructions to the word of God that has been revealed. There  is a great deal that has been revealed that has not yet been lived up  to, I assure you. There is a great deal yet remaining to be learned.  There is a"]]]
