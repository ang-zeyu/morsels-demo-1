[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#11)"],[1,"Farquhar, the Superintendent of Police,  arrived from the coast with a score of sepoys to assist in hunting down  the man-eaters, whose fame had by this time spread far and wide, and  the most elaborate precautions were taken, his men being posted on the  most convenient trees near every camp. Several other officials had also  come up on leave to join in the chase, and each of these guarded a  likely spot in the same way, Mr. Whitehead sharing my post inside the  crib on the girder. Further, in spite of some chaff, my lion trap was  put in thorough working order, and two of the sepoys were installed as  bait.    Our preparations were quite complete by nightfall, and we all took up  our appointed positions. Nothing happened until about nine o'clock,  when to my great satisfaction the intense stillness was suddenly broken  by the noise of the door of the trap clattering down. \"At last,\" I  thought, \"one at least of the brutes is done for.\" But the sequel was  an ignominious one.    The bait-sepoys had a lamp burning inside their part of the cage, and  were each armed with a Martini rifle, with plenty of ammunition. They  had also been given strict orders to shoot at once if a lion should  enter the trap. Instead of doing so, however, they were so terrified  when he rushed in and began to lash himself madly against the bars of  the cage, that they completely lost their heads and were actually too  unnerved to fire. Not for some minutes--not, indeed, until Mr.  Farquhar, whose post was close by, shouted at them and cheered them  on--did they at all recover themselves. Then when at last they did  begin to fire, they fired with a vengeance--anywhere, anyhow. Whitehead  and I were at right angles to the direction in which they should have  shot, and yet their bullets came whizzing all round us. Altogether they  fired over a score of shots, and in the end succeeded only in blowing  away one of the bars of the door, thus allowing our prize to make good  his escape. How they failed to kill him several times over is, and  always will be, a complete mystery to me, as they could have put the  muzzles of their rifles absolutely touching his body. There was,  indeed, some blood scattered about the trap, but it was small  consolation to know that the brute, whose capture and death seemed so  certain, had only been slightly wounded.    Still we were not unduly dejected, and when morning came, a hunt was at  once arranged. Accordingly we spent the greater part of the day on our  hands and knees following the lions through the dense thickets of  thorny jungle, but though we heard their growls from time to time, we  never succeeded in actually coming up with them. Of the whole party,  only Farquhar managed to catch a momentary glimpse of one as it bounded  over a bush. Two days more were spent in the same manner, and with  equal unsuccess; and then Farquhar and his sepoys were obliged to  return to the coast. Mr. Whitehead also departed for his district, and  once again I was left alone with the man-eaters.          CHAPTER VIII    THE DEATH OF THE FIRST MAN-EATER      A day or two after the departure of my allies, as I was leaving my boma  soon after dawn on December 9, I saw a Swahili running excitedly  towards me, shouting out \"Simba! Simba!\" (\"Lion! Lion!\"), and every now  and again looking behind him as he ran. On questioning him I found that  the lions had tried to snatch a man from the camp by the river, but  being foiled in this had seized and killed one of the donkeys, and were  at that moment busy devouring it not far off. Now was my chance.    I rushed for the heavy rifle which Farquhar had kindly left with me for  use in case an opportunity such as this should arise, and, led by the  Swahili, I started most carefully to stalk the lions, who, I devoutly  hoped, were confining their attention strictly to their meal. I was  getting on splendidly, and could just make out the outline of one of  them through the dense bush, when unfortunately my guide snapped a  rotten branch. The wily beast heard the noise, growled his defiance,  and disappeared in a moment into a patch of even thicker jungle close  by. In desperation at the thought of his escaping me once again, I  crept hurriedly back to the camp, summoned the available workmen and  told them to bring all the tom-toms, tin cans, and other noisy  instruments of any kind that could be found. As quickly as possible I  posted them in a half-circle round the thicket, and gave the head  jemadar instructions to start a simultaneous beating of the tom-toms  and cans as soon as he judged that I had had time to get round to the  other side. I then crept round by myself and soon found a good position  and one which the lion was most likely to retreat past, as it was in  the middle of a broad animal path leading straight from the place where  he was concealed. I lay down behind a small ant hill, and waited  expectantly. Very soon I heard a tremendous din being raised by the  advancing line of coolies, and almost immediately, to my intense joy,  out into the open path stepped a huge maneless lion. It was the first  occasion during all these trying months upon which I had had a fair  chance at one of these brutes, and my satisfaction at the prospect of  bagging him was unbounded.    Slowly he advanced along the path, stopping every few seconds to look  round. I was only partially concealed from view, and if his attention  had not been so fully occupied by the noise behind him, he must have  observed me. As he was oblivious to my presence, however, I let him  approach to within about fifteen yards of me, and then covered him with  my rifle. The moment I moved to do this, he caught sight of me, and  seemed much astonished at my sudden appearance, for he stuck his  forefeet into the ground, threw himself back on his haunches and  growled savagely. As I covered his brain with my rifle, I felt that at  last I had him absolutely at my mercy, but .... never trust an  untried weapon! I pulled the trigger, and to my horror heard the dull  snap that tells of a misfire.    Worse was to follow. I was so taken aback and disconcerted by this  untoward accident that I entirely forgot to fire the left barrel, and  lowered the rifle from my shoulder with the intention of reloading--if  I should be given time. Fortunately for me, the lion was so distracted  by the terrific din and uproar of the coolies behind him that instead  of springing on me, as might have been expected, he bounded aside into  the jungle again. By this time I had collected my wits, and just as he  jumped I let him have the left barrel. An answering angry growl told me  that he had been hit; but nevertheless he succeeded once more in  getting clear away, for although I tracked him for some little  distance, I eventually lost his trail in a rocky patch of ground.    Bitterly did I anathematise the hour in which I had relied on a  borrowed weapon, and in my disappointment and vexation I abused owner,  maker, and rifle with fine impartiality. On extracting the unexploded  cartridge, I found that the needle had not struck home, the cap being  only slightly dented; so that the whole fault did indeed lie with the  rifle, which I later returned to Farquhar with polite compliments.  Seriously, however, my continued ill-luck was most exasperating; and  the result was that the Indians were more than ever confirmed in their  belief that the lions were really evil spirits, proof against mortal  weapons. Certainly, they did seem to bear charmed lives.    After this dismal failure there was, of course, nothing to do but to  return to camp. Before doing so, however, I proceeded to view the dead  donkey, which I found to have been only slightly devoured it the  quarters. It is a curious fact that lions always begin at the tail of  their prey and eat upwards towards the head. As their meal had thus  been interrupted evidently at the very beginning, I felt pretty sure  that one or other of the brutes would return to the carcase at  nightfall. Accordingly, as there was no tree of any kind close at hand,  I had a staging erected some ten feet away from the body. This machan  was about twelve feet high and was composed of four poles stuck into  the ground and inclined towards each other at the top, where a plank  was lashed to serve as a seat. Further, as the nights were still pitch  dark, I had the donkey's carcase secured by strong wires to a  neighbouring stump, so that the lions might not be able to drag it away  before I could get a shot at them.    At sundown, therefore, I took up my position on my airy perch, and much  to the disgust of my gun-bearer, Mahina, I decided to go alone. I would  gladly have taken him with me, indeed, but he had a bad cough, and I  was afraid lest he should make any involuntary noise or movement which  might spoil all. Darkness fell almost immediately, and everything  became extraordinarily still. The silence of an African jungle on a  dark night needs to be experienced to be realised; it is most  impressive, especially when one is absolutely alone and isolated from  one's fellow creatures, as I was then. The solitude and stillness, and  the purpose of my vigil, all had their effect on me, and from a  condition of strained expectancy I gradually fell into a dreamy mood  which harmonised well with my surroundings. Suddenly I was startled out  of my reverie by the snapping of a twig: and, straining my ears for a  further sound, I fancied I could hear the rustling of a large body  forcing its way through the bush. \"The man-eater,\" I thought to myself;  \"surely to-night my luck will change and I shall bag one of the  brutes.\" Profound silence again succeeded; I sat on my eyrie like a  statue, every nerve tense with excitement. Very soon, however, all  doubt as to the presence of the lion was dispelled. A deep long-drawn  sigh--sure sign of hunger--came up from the bushes, and the rustling  commenced again as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38189"],[0,"A Treatise on Sheep: (#11)"],[1,"  to work on lower terms than those of England. This was owing          to the rent of land being less in Ireland than in England.            [8] By the 18th of Charles II. the importation from Ireland          into England of great cattle, sheep, swine, beef, pork and          bacon, and shortly after of mutton, lamb, butter, and cheese,          was declared a common nuisance, and forbidden on pain of          forfeiture. Thus, the principal resource of a poor country in          the neighbourhood of a rich one, was unfeelingly denied to it,          till the reign of George III., when the hated edict was          repealed.    (54.) _British Trade in 1699._--In 1699 there were 12,000,000 sheep  and lambs in Britain, and the yearly increase was supposed to be about  3,600,000. The value of each sheep, besides the skin, was 7s. 4d. The  stock was valued at L4,400,000. The value of the wool yearly shorn,  at 3s. 4d. per fleece, came to about L2,000,000. The woollens  manufactured in Britain amounted in value to L5,000,000 per annum,  while our yearly exports of the same were valued at L2,000,000. Many  were at that time afraid of the sinking of the woollen manufacture,  because the accounts of the fine draperies exported were larger than  usual; but, says an anonymous essayist of the period, \"such do not  contemplate, that, though the old may be lessened, what is commonly  called the new draperies have increased, consisting in bays, serges,  and stuffs. So that upon the whole, infinitely more of the material of  wool has of late years been wrought up for foreign use, than in former  times; and herein our merchants have been only forced to follow the  modes and humours of those people with whom they deal, and the course  they have pursued has hitherto not been detrimental to the public.\"  * * * \"'Twere better, indeed, that the call from abroad were only for  the fine draperies, because then we should be in a manner without a  rival; no country, but England, and Ireland, having a sward or turf  that will rear sheep, producing the wool of which most of our  draperies are made. 'Tis true the wool of Spain is fine above all  others; but 'tis the wear only of the richer sort, and of Spanish  cloths not above nine thousand pieces are sent abroad, one year with  another.\"    (55.) _British Woollens rivalled by those of Sweden._--Before the  peace of Utrecht in 1713, we had no rival in the woollen trade but the  Dutch, over whom we had many natural advantages, such as situation,  goodness of our ports, and excellence of the principal constituents of  the manufacture. They were obliged to furnish themselves with the  materials at second-hand. When the trade in woollens was properly set  a-foot in England, during the long and happy reign of Elizabeth, the  interest of money was pretty much the same in both countries; but the  Dutch were engaged in a hazardous and bloody war, and in establishing  their Commonwealth, and East India trade; and, therefore, had not much  time to think of improving any manufacture. Owing to these  circumstances, we came into possession of all the principal marts for  woollens, both in Asia and Europe, and retained them till the  beginning of the war with France and Spain; we then prohibited trade  with both these countries.    About the year 1720, our exportations to Sweden, of cloth, stuffs,  and other woollen manufactures, amounted to L50,000. The Swedes,  however, though situated in a severe climate, tried experiments with  English sheep, and with so great success, that, in 1765, they could  boast of wool little inferior to that of England. They then erected  manufactories, and we were compelled to relinquish a market, which we  had long held to our profit and advantage.    (56.) _Regulations from 1740 to 1742._--In the 12th year of King  George II. it was enacted by a statute (cap. 21), \"That whereas the  taking off the duties upon woollen or bay yarn imported from Ireland,  may be a means to prevent the exportation of wool, and of woollen  manufactures, from Ireland to foreign parts, and may also be of use to  the manufacturers of Great Britain, that from the first of May, 1740,  the same shall be no longer payable; excepting only the duties upon  worsted yarn of two or more threads twisted or thrown, or on crewel  imported from Ireland.\" At this time more than 1,500,000 persons were  employed on woollen articles, and were supposed to earn, one with  another, sixpence a-day for 313 working days, amounting in all to  L11,737,500 yearly.    In 1742, the English poor suffered much from the contempt with which  home manufactures were regarded by the nobility, in consequence of  which the latter were speedily the losers. The importation of woollen  broad-cloth, of the manufacture of France, into ports of the Levant,  on behalf of British subjects, being not only prejudicial by  discouraging the woollen manufactures of Britain, but likewise a means  of affording relief to an enemy, and discoveries having been made of  British subjects fraudulently shipping from Leghorn quantities of  French woollen goods for Turkey, under the denomination of British, to  the great detriment of English woollens; an act was passed in the 23d  year of King George II. by which provision was made against these and  other fraudulent practices.    (57.) _Improvements in the manufacturing of Woollens._--At the  commencement of the reign of George III. the woollen manufactures  advanced with a rapidity almost unparalleled in modern times as  regards other branches of trade. Till about the year 1770 most of the  processes were conducted by hand. The wool was spun by various persons  at scattered residences, the manufacturers receiving the yarn  periodically from the numerous spinners. This arrangement caused much  loss of time, and gave rise to frequent squabbles between the masters  and their workmen. In fact, all the operations were tardy in the  extreme. But at this period, the spirit of public and private inquiry  was happily directed to our deficiencies in the machinery of  manufactures. Inventions of great beauty and ingenuity were slowly  brought forward to facilitate our commercial acquirements. Human  labour has thus been lightened and abridged,--a greater number of  hands have been profitably employed, and an excellent lesson afforded  to the lovers of use and wont, which will not speedily be forgotten.    By these improved means the cloth is possessed of greater evenness,  less injury is sustained in the dressing and shearing, and greater  beauty is imparted to its appearance. A great advantage is also  obtained by the master knowing the exact duration of each process, so  that he can time his goods for any hour, or market, and is enabled to  circulate his capital with a degree of certainty, and despatch,  formerly looked upon as quite impossible. A few years ago the late Sir  John Throckmorton sat down to dinner, dressed in a coat, the wool of  which, on the same morning, was on the sheep's back. The animals were  sheared, the wool washed, carded, spun, and woven; the cloth was  scoured, fulled, sheared, dyed and dressed, and then made into a coat.  All these complex operations were gone through without hurry, and  without deducting from the work any part of the time usually devoted  to similar fabrics. So great was the advantage derived from this  application of machinery, that in the year 1800 the produce was three  times larger than in the year 1739, though the number of persons  employed was the same in the one year as in the other.    (58.) _Duty imposed on imported Wool._--For three centuries a free  importation of foreign wool was permitted by our government, and it  was not till 1803 that any one thought of laying a duty upon it. This  duty was at first comparatively light, amounting only to a halfpenny  a-pound, and it continued under a penny a-pound, till 1819, when Mr  Vansittart raised it to six-pence. The impolicy of this measure is  evident, when we consider, that we were losing our ascendancy in this  manufacture, that our export of woollen goods had been declining for  three years previous to 1819, and that the competition was becoming  every moment more severe. This tax was much dreaded by our merchants,  who, clearly perceiving the state of matters, warned Mr Vansittart, by  representing to him, in the strongest terms, the fatal influence it  would have upon our trade. Its effects are best exhibited by its  disastrous influence on the foreign trade in woollens, which fell off  about a fourth in value, almost immediately after the imposition. The  following table places this in the clearest point of view:--      _Declared value of woollens exported._      1816,                                  L9,387,455    1817,                                   7,847,280    1818,                                   7,177,335    1819,                                   8,145,327    1820,           (_duty increased_)      5,989,622    1821,                (_ditto_)          5,587,758    1822,                (_ditto_)          6,465,988    1823,                (_ditto_)          6,490,454    1824,                (_ditto_)          5,635,776    1825,                (_ditto_)          6,045,240    The opinions of our merchants ought to have formed the best of all  beacons in pointing the course to be pursued by Mr Vansittart; but,  even if they had been silent on the subject, the evidence of Mr  Bainbridge, before the Committee of the House of Commons, appointed in  1820, to inquire into the state of the foreign trade of the country,  might have informed him of the true position of the wool trade, and  directed him in so hazardous an undertaking. When Mr B. was asked  whether he thought that an increase in the means of paying for our  manufactures would produce an increased consumption of them in Russia,  Sweden, and Prussia, he replied:--\"I believe the woollen manufactures  in Prussia are in such a state as to be "]]]
