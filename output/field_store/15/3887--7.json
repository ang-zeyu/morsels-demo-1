It was  an impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really  matter in any sense we know. It was like its father--and most of it has  gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material  universe; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of  human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.\"    There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of  poor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so  that he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick  itself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had  prostrated him burst in upon him again.    \"_Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face ... that haff face on top of it ...  that face with the red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like  the Whateleys.... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing,  but they was a haff-shaped man's face on top of it, an' it looked like  Wizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards acrost...._\"    He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a  bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon  Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been  silent heretofore, spoke aloud.    \"Fifteen year' gone,\" he rambled, \"I heerd Ol' Whateley say as haow  some day we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on  the top o' Sentinel Hill....\"    But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.    \"_What was it, anyhaow_, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it  aout o' the air it come from?\"    Armitage chose his words carefully.    \"It was--well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our  part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself  by other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business  calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people  and very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur  Whateley himself--enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of  him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I'm going  to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite  that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing  stones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings  those Whateleys were so fond of--the beings they were going to let in  tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some  nameless place for some nameless purpose.    \"But as to this thing we've just sent back--the Whateleys raised it for  a terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big  from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big--but it beat him  because it had a greater share of the _outsideness_ in it. You needn't  ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn't call it out. _It was  his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did._\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/502"],[0,"Desert Gold (#11)"],[1,"the moon-white sky.  The  horses were evidently tiring, for they showed no impatience.  Gale  heard their panting breaths, and also the bark of some animal--a dog or  a coyote.  It sounded like a dog, and this led Gale to wonder if there  was any house near at hand.  To the right, up under the ledges some  distance away, stood two square black objects, too uniform, he thought,  to be rocks.  While he was peering at them, uncertain what to think,  the shrill whistle of a horse pealed out, to be followed by the  rattling of hoofs on hard stone.  Then a dog barked.  At the same  moment that Ladd hurriedly appeared in the road a light shone out and  danced before one of the square black objects.    \"Keep close an' don't make no noise,\" he whispered, and led his horse  at right angles off the road.    Gale followed, leading Mercedes's horse.  As he turned he observed that  Lash also had dismounted.    To keep closely at Ladd's heels without brushing the cactus or  stumbling over rocks and depressions was a task Gale found impossible.  After he had been stabbed several times by the bayonetlike spikes,  which seemed invisible, the matter of caution became equally one of  self-preservation.  Both the cowboys, Dick had observed, wore leather  chaps.  It was no easy matter to lead a spirited horse through the  dark, winding lanes walled by thorns.  Mercedes horse often balked and  had to be coaxed and carefully guided.  Dick concluded that Ladd was  making a wide detour.  The position of certain stars grown familiar  during the march veered round from one side to another.  Dick saw that  the travel was fast, but by no means noiseless.  The pack animals at  times crashed and ripped through the narrow places.  It seemed to Gale  that any one within a mile could have heard these sounds.  From the  tops of knolls or ridges he looked back, trying to locate the mesas  where the light had danced and the dog had barked alarm.  He could not  distinguish these two rocky eminences from among many rising in the  background.    Presently Ladd let out into a wider lane that appeared to run straight.  The cowboy mounted his horse, and this fact convinced Gale that they  had circled back to the road.  The march proceeded then once more at a  good, steady, silent walk.  When Dick consulted his watch he was amazed  to see that the hour was still early.  How much had happened in little  time!  He now began to be aware that the night was growing colder; and,  strange to him, he felt something damp that in a country he knew he  would have recognized as dew. He had not been aware there was dew on  the desert.  The wind blew stronger, the stars shone whiter, the sky  grew darker, and the moon climbed toward the zenith.  The road  stretched level for miles, then crossed arroyos and ridges, wound  between mounds of broken ruined rock, found a level again, and then  began a long ascent. Dick asked Mercedes if she was cold, and she  answered that she was, speaking especially of her feet, which were  growing numb. Then she asked to be helped down to walk awhile.  At  first she was cold and lame, and accepted the helping hand Dick  proffered.  After a little, however, she recovered and went on without  assistance. Dick could scarcely believe his eyes, as from time to time  he stole a sidelong glance at this silent girl, who walked with lithe  and rapid stride.  She was wrapped in his long coat, yet it did not  hide her slender grace.  He could not see her face, which was concealed  by the black mantle.    A low-spoken word from Ladd recalled Gale to the question of  surroundings and of possible dangers.  Ladd had halted a few yards  ahead.  They had reached the summit of what was evidently a high ridge  which sloped with much greater steepness on the far side. It was only  after a few more forward steps, however, that Dick could see down the  slope.  Then full in view flashed a bright campfire around which  clustered a group of dark figures.  They were encamped in a wide  arroyo, where horses could be seen grazing in black patches of grass  between clusters of trees.  A second look at the campers told Gale they  were Mexicans.  At this moment Lash came forward to join Ladd, and the  two spent a long, uninterrupted moment studying the arroyo.  A hoarse  laugh, faint yet distinct, floated up on the cool wind.    \"Well, Laddy, what're you makin' of that outfit?\" inquired Lash,  speaking softly.    \"Same as any of them raider outfits,\" replied Ladd.  \"They're across  the line for beef.  But they'll run off any good stock.  As hoss  thieves these rebels have got 'em all beat.  That outfit is waitin'  till it's late.  There's a ranch up the arroyo.\"    Gale heard the first speaker curse under his breath.    \"Sure, I feel the same,\" said Ladd.  \"But we've got a girl an' the  young man to look after, not to mention our pack outfit. An' we're  huntin' for a job, not a fight, old hoss.  Keep on your chaps!\"    \"Nothin' to it but head south for the Rio Forlorn.\"    \"You're talkin' sense now, Jim.  I wish we'd headed that way long ago.  But it ain't strange I'd want to travel away from the border, thinkin'  of the girl.  Jim, we can't go round this Greaser outfit an' strike the  road again.  Too rough.  So we'll have to give up gettin' to San  Felipe.\"    \"Perhaps it's just as well, Laddy.  Rio Forlorn is on the border line,  but it's country where these rebels ain't been yet.\"    \"Wait till they learn of the oasis an' Beldin's hosses!\" exclaimed  Laddy.  \"I'm not anticipatin' peace anywhere along the border, Jim.  But we can't go ahead; we can't go back.\"    \"What'll we do, Laddy?  It's a hike to Beldin's ranch.  An' if we get  there in daylight some Greaser will see the girl before Beldin' can  hide her.  It'll get talked about.  The news'll travel to Casita like  sage balls before the wind.\"    \"Shore we won't ride into Rio Forlorn in the daytime.  Let's slip the  packs, Jim.  We can hid them off in the cactus an' come back after  them.  With the young man ridin' we--\"    The whispering was interrupted by a loud ringing neigh that whistled up  from the arroyo.  One of the horses had scented the travelers on the  ridge top.  The indifference of the Mexicans changed to attention.    Ladd and Lash turned back and led the horses into the first opening on  the south side of the road.  There was nothing more said at the moment,  and manifestly the cowboys were in a hurry.  Gale had to run in the  open places to keep up.  When they did stop it was welcome to Gale, for  he had begun to fall behind.    The packs were slipped, securely tied and hidden in a mesquite clump.  Ladd strapped a blanket around one of the horses.  His next move was to  take off his chaps.    \"Gale, you're wearin' boots, an' by liftin' your feet you can beat the  cactus,\" he whispered.  \"But the--the--Miss Castaneda, she'll be torn  all to pieces unless she puts these on.  Please tell her--an' hurry.\"    Dick took the chaps, and, going up to Mercedes, he explained the  situation.  She laughed, evidently at his embarrassed earnestness, and  slipped out of the saddle.    \"Senor, chapparejos and I are not strangers,\" she said.    Deftly and promptly she equipped herself, and then Gale helped her into  the saddle, called to her horse, and started off.  Lash directed Gale  to mount the other saddled horse and go next.    Dick had not ridden a hundred yards behind the trotting leaders before  he had sundry painful encounters with reaching cactus arms. The horse  missed these by a narrow margin.  Dick's knees appeared to be in line,  and it became necessary for him to lift them high and let his boots  take the onslaught of the spikes.  He was at home in the saddle, and  the accomplishment was about the only one he possessed that had been of  any advantage during his sojourn in the West.    Ladd pursued a zigzag course southward across the desert, trotting down  the aisles, cantering in wide, bare patches, walking through the clumps  of cacti.  The desert seemed all of a sameness to Dick--a wilderness of  rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges, always looking  close, yet never growing any nearer. The moon slanted back toward the  west, losing its white radiance, and the gloom of the earlier evening  began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas.  By and  by Ladd entered an arroyo, and here the travelers turned and twisted  with the meanderings of a dry stream bed.  At the head of a canyon they  had to take once more to the rougher ground.  Always it led down,  always it grew rougher, more rolling, with wider bare spaces, always  the black ranges loomed close.    Gale became chilled to the bone, and his clothes were damp and cold.  His knees smarted from the wounds of the poisoned thorns, and his right  hand was either swollen stiff or too numb to move.  Moreover, he was  tiring.  The excitement, the long walk, the miles on miles of jolting  trot--these had wearied him.  Mercedes must be made of steel, he  thought, to stand all that she had been subjected to and yet, when the  stars were paling and dawn perhaps not far away, stay in the saddle.    So Dick Gale rode on, drowsier for each mile, and more and more giving  the horse a choice of ground.  Sometimes a prod from a murderous spine  roused Dick.  A grayness had blotted out the waning moon in the west  and the clear, dark, starry sky overhead.  Once when Gale, thinking to  fight his weariness, raised his head, he saw that one of the horses in  the lead was riderless.  Ladd was carrying Mercedes.  Dick marveled  that her collapse had not come sooner. Another time, rousing himself  again, he imagined they were now on a good hard road.    It seemed that hours passed, though he knew only little time had  elapsed, when once more he threw off the spell of weariness.  He heard  a dog bark.  Tall trees lined the open lane down which he was riding.  Presently in the gray gloom he saw low, square houses with flat roofs."]]]
