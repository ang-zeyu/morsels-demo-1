[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5992"],[0,"Station Amusements in New Zealand (#11)"],[1," to make, without  either proper materials or tools, a sledge which could hold two people  (for F---- declared it was no fun sleighing alone), but his \"patent  brakes\" proved the most broken of reeds to lean upon when the sledge was  dashing down the steep incline at the rate of a thousand miles an hour.    We nearly broke our necks more than once, and I look back now with  amazement to our fool-hardiness. How well I remember one expedition,  when F----, who had been hammering away in a shed all the morning, came  to find me sitting in the sun in the verandah, and to inform me that  at last he had perfected a conveyance which would combine speed with  safety. Undaunted by previous mishaps, I sallied forth, and in company  with Mr. U---- and F----, climbed painfully up the high hill I have  mentioned, by some steps which they had cut in the frozen snow. Without  some such help we could not have kept our footing for a moment, and as  long as I live I shall never forget the sensation of leaving my friendly  Alpenstock planted in the snow, and of seating myself on that frail  sledge. Perhaps I ought to describe it here. A board, about six feet  long by one foot broad, with sheet-iron nailed beneath it, and curved  upwards in front; on its upper surface a couple of battens were fixed,  one quite at the foremost end, and one half-way. That was F----'s new  patent sledge, warranted to go faster down an incline than any other  conveyance on the surface of the earth. I was the wretched \"passenger,\"  as he called me, on more than one occasion, and I will briefly describe  my experiences. \"Why did you go?\" is a very natural question to arise in  my reader's mind; and sitting here at my writing-table, I feel as if I  must have been a lunatic to venture. But in those delicious wild days,  no enterprise seemed too rash or dangerous to engage in, from mounting  a horse which had never seen or felt the fluttering of a habit, to  embarking on the conveyance I have described above, and starting down a  mountain-side at the risk of a broken neck.    Well, to return to that terrible moment. I see the whole scene now. The  frail, rude sledge, with its breaks made out of a couple of standards  from a wire fence, connected by a strong iron chain; F----seated at the  back of the precious contrivance, firmly grasping a standard in each  hand; Mr. U---- clinging desperately to his Alpen-stock with one hand,  whilst with the other he helps me on to the board; and Nettle, my dear  little terrier, standing shivering on three legs, sniffing distrustfully  at the sledge. It is extremely difficult even to take one's place on  a board a dozen inches wide. My petticoats have to be firmly wrapped  around me, and care taken that no fold projects beyond the sledge, or  I should be soon dragged out of my frail seat. I fix my feet firmly  against the batten, and F---- cries, \"Are you ready?\" \"Oh, not yet!\"  I gasp, clinging to Mr. U----'s hand as if I never meant to let it go.  \"Hold tight!\" he shouts. Now what a mockery this injunction was. I  had nothing to hold on to except my own knees, and I clasped them  convulsively. Mr. U---- says, \"You're all right now,\" and before I can  realize that he has let go my hand, before my courage is half-way up to  the necessary height, we are off. The breaks are slightly depressed for  the first few yards, in order to regulate our pace, and because there  is a tremendously steep pitch just at first. Once we have safely passed  that he tilts up the standards, and our sledge shoots like a meteor down  the perfectly smooth incline. I cannot draw my breath, we are going at  such a pace through the keen air; I give myself up for lost. We come to  another steep pitch near the bottom of the hill; F---- is laughing to  such a degree at me that he does not put down his breaks soon enough,  and loses control of the sledge. We appear to leap down the dip, and  then the sledge turns first one way and then the other, its zinc prow  being sometimes up-hill and some-times down. It seems wonderful that  we keep on the sledge, for we have no means of holding on except by  pressing our feet against the battens; yet in the grand and final upset  at the bottom of the hill, the sledge is there too, and we find we have  never parted company from it.    Will any one believe that after such a perilous journey, I could  actually be persuaded to try again? But so it was. At first the fright  (for I was really terrified) used to make me very cross, and I declared  that I was severely hurt, if not \"kilt entirely;\" but after I had shaken  the snow out of my linsey skirt, and discovered that beyond the damage  to my nerves I was uninjured, F---- was quite sure to try to persuade  me to make another attempt, and I was equally sure to yield to the  temptation. As well as my memory serves me, we only made one really  successful journey, and that was on an occasion when we kept the breaks  down the whole way. But I never could insure similar precautions being  taken again, and we consequently experienced every variety of mishaps  possible to sledge travellers. I persevered however for some days until  the north-westerly wind, which was blowing softly all the time, began to  lay bare the sharpest points of the rocks, and then I gave in at once,  and would not be a \"passenger\" any more. It was rather too much to  strike one's head against a jagged fragment of rock, or to dislocate  one's thumb against a concealed stump of a palm tree. Then the sharp  points of the Spaniards began to stick up through the softening snow,  and nothing would induce me to run the risk of touching their green  bayonets. Besides which, the fast-thawing snow made it very difficult  to climb up to the top of our hill, for the carefully-cut steps had  disappeared long ago. So I gave up sledge journeys on my own account,  and used only to look at F---- and Mr. U---- taking them.    These two persevered so long as an inch of snow remained on the  hill-side. Some of their adventures were very alarming, and certainly  rather dangerous. One afternoon I had been watching them for more than  an hour, and had seen them go through every variety of disaster, and  capsize with no further effect than increasing their desire for \"one  more\" trial. On the blind-side of the hill,--that is to say the side  which gets scarcely any sun in winter,--a deep drift of snow still  lingered, filling up a furrow made in former years by a shingle-slip.  Thither the two adventurous climbers dragged their sledge, and down  the steep incline they performed their perilous descent many a time. I  became tired of watching the board shoot swiftly over the white streak;  and I strolled round the shoulder of the hill, to see if there was any  appearance of the snow-fall lessening in the back country.    I must have been away about half an hour, and had made the circuit of  the little knoll which projected from the mountain side, returning to  where I expected to find sleigh and sleighers starting perhaps on just  \"one more\" journey. But no one was there, and a dozen yards or so from  the usual starting-point, the snow was a good deal ploughed up and  stained in large patches by blood. Here was an alarming spectacle,  though the only wonder was that a bad accident had not occurred before.  I saw the sledge, deserted and broken, near the end of the drift: of the  passengers there was neither sign nor token. I must say I was terribly  frightened, but it is useless in New Zealand to scream or faint; the  only thing to do in an emergency is to _coo-e_; and so, although my  heart was thumping loudly in my ears, and at first I could not produce a  sound, I managed at last, after many attempts, to muster up a loud clear  _coo-e_. There was the usual pause, whilst the last sharp note rang  back from the hill-sides, and vibrated through the clear silent air;  and then, oh, welcome sound! I heard a vigorous answer from our own flat  where the homestead stood. I set off down-hill as fast as I could, and  had the joy, when I turned the slope which had hidden our little house  from my view, to see F---- and Mr. U---- walking about; but even from  that distance I could see that poor Mr. U----'s head was bandaged up,  and as soon as I got near enough to hear, F----shouted \"I have broken my  neck!\" adding, \"I am very hungry: let us go in to supper.\"    Under the circumstances these words were consolatory; and when I came to  hear the story, this was the way the accident happened. As I mentioned  before, even this drift had thawed till it was soft at the surface and  worn away almost to the rocks. During a rapid descent the nose of the  sledge dipped through the snow, and stopped dead against a rock. Mr.  U---- was instantly buried in the snow, falling into a young but prickly  Spaniard, which assaulted him grievously; but F---- shot over his head  some ten yards, turned a somersault, and alit on his feet. This sounds  a harmless performance enough, but it requires practice; and F----  declared that for weeks afterwards his neck felt twisted. The accident  must have looked very ridiculous: the sledge one moment gliding smoothly  along at the rate of forty miles an hour,--the next a dead stop, and  F----flying through the air over his passenger's head, finishing feet  first plump down in the soft snow.    Looking back on that time, I can remember how curiously soon the  external traces of the great snow-storm disappeared. For some weeks  after the friendly nor-wester, the air of the whole neighbourhood was  tainted by dead and decaying sheep and lambs; and the wire fences,  stock-yard rails, and every \"coign of vantage,\" had to be made useful  but ghastly by a tapestry of sheep-skins. The only wonder was that a  single sheep had survived a storm severe enough to kill wild pigs. Great  boars, cased in hides an inch thick, had perished through sheer stress  of weather; while thin-skinned animals, with only a few months growth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5994"],[0,"Our Nervous Friends — Illustrating the Mastery of Nervousness (#11)"],[1,"even at this Academy demanded special  effort, which, with Henry, was not forthcoming, so he returned home  without his diploma. This incident decided him not to attempt college,  so for a year he again basked in the indulgences of home-life. His  father's business interests had no appeal for him, but the personal  influence of a young doctor, with his vivid tales of medical-college  experiences, and the struggling within of a never recognized ambition,  with some haphazard suggestions from his mother, determined him to  study medicine.    At this time a medical degree could still be obtained in a few schools  at the end of two years' attendance. Henry chose a Tennessee college  which has, for reasons, long since ceased to exist, an institution  which practically guaranteed diplomas. Here after three very  comfortable years, he was transformed into \"Doc\" Stoneleigh. At  twenty-five, \"Doc\" weighed two hundred and forty, and returned home  for another period of rest. He did not open an office, nor did he ever  begin the practice of his profession. During the next five years he  lived at home, sleeping and reading until two in the afternoon, his  mother carrying breakfast and lunch to his room. The late afternoons  and evenings he spent in hotel-lobbies and pool-rooms, where he was  always welcomed by a bunch of sports. Popular through his small  prodigalities, he, at thirty, possessed a more than local reputation  for the completeness of his assortment of salacious stories--his  memory and native social instinct were herein successfully utilized.  \"Doc\" now weighed two hundred and eighty-five, ate much, exercised  none, and was the silent proprietor of a pool-room, obnoxious even in  this wide-open town.    At twelve he had begun smoking cigarettes; at twenty he smoked them  day and night. The entire family drank beer, but, oddly, the desire  for alcohol never developed with him. Yet at thirty he began acting  queerly, and it was generally thought that he was drinking. Often now  he did not go home at night and was frequently found dead asleep on  one of his pool-tables. He had fixed up a den of a room where they  would move him to \"sleep it off.\" A fad for small rifles developed  till he finally had over twenty of different makes in his den and  spent many nights wandering around the alleys, shooting rats and stray  cats. Eats became an obsession. They invaded his room and he would  frequently awaken suddenly and empty the first gun he reached at their  imaginary forms, much to the disquiet of the neighbors. One night he  burst out of his place, began shooting wildly up and down the street  and rushing about in a frenzy. No single guardian of the peace  presumed to interfere with his hilarity, and two of the six who came  in the patrol-wagon had dismissed action for deep contemplation before  he was safely locked up as \"drunk.\" The matter was kept quiet, as  befitted the prominence of the Stoneleighs.    To his mother's devotion now was added fear, and she freely responded  to his demands for funds. There were no more outbreaks, but he was  obviously becoming irresponsible, and influences finally secured his  mother's consent to take him to a special institution in another  state. This was quietly effected through the cooperation of the family  physician, who successfully drugged poor \"Doc\" into pacific inertness.  He was legally committed to an institution empowered to use  constructive restraint, and for four months benefited by the only  wholesome training his wretched life had ever known. Here it was  discovered that he had been using quantities of codein and cocain,  against the sale of which there were then no restrictions. Unusual had  been his physical equipment, his indulgences unchecked by any  sentiment or restraint, the penalty of inactivity was meting a  horrible exaction--an exaction which could be dulled only by dope. In  the early prime of what should have been manhood, this unfortunate's  mind, as revealed to the institution's authorities during his days of  enforced drugless discomfort, was a filthy cess-pool; cursings and  imprecations, vile and vicious, were vomited forth in answer to every  pain. His brother, his doctors, his mother were execrated for days,  almost without ceasing. Here was a man without principle. As he became  more comfortable, physically, he became more decent, and later his  natural, social tendencies began to reappear attractively.    At the end of four months the patient was perforce much better. He  then succeeded in inducing his mother to have him released \"on  probation.\" Many fair promises were made. For months he was to have an  attendant as a companion. His mother, believing him well, consented,  after securing his promise in writing to return for treatment should  there be a relapse into his old habits. As evidencing the decay of his  character, these fair promises were made without the slightest  intention that they would be kept. The first important city reached  after crossing the state-line saw his demeanor change. Beyond the  legal authority of the state in which he had been committed, he was  free, and he knew it. With a few words he consigned his now helpless  attendant to regions sulphurous, and alone took train in the opposite  direction from home. For several months he went the paces. With his  medical knowledge and warned by his recent experiences he was able to  so adjust his doses as to avoid falling into the hands of the  authorities. The weak mother never refused to honor his drafts. Six  months later a serious attack of pneumonia caused her to be sent for,  and when he was able to travel she took him back to the home he had  forsworn.    For over ten years \"Doc\" Stoneleigh has lived with his mother, a  recluse, a morphin-soaked wreck. Sometimes he may be seen in a park  near their home, sitting for hours inert, or automatically tracing  figures in the gravel with his cane, noticing no one, unkempt, almost  repellent. He is still sufficiently shrewd to secure morphin in  violation of the law. Sooner or later the revenue department will cut  off his supply. He drifts, a rotting hulk of manhood, unconsciously  nearing the horrors of a drugless reality.    The depth of this man's degradation may tempt us to feel that he was  defective, but an accurate analysis of his life fails to reveal any  deficiency save that reprehensible training which made possible his  years of physical and mental indolence.          CHAPTER VIII    LEARNING TO EAT      It was three in the early July afternoon. The large parlor, which had  been turned into a bedroom, was darkened by closely-drawn shades; a  dim, softened light coming from a half-hidden lamp deepened the dark  rings around the worn nurse's eyes--eyes which bespoke sleepless  nights and a heavy heart. A wan mother stood near the nurse, every  line of her face showing the pain of lengthened anxiety. Tensely one  hand held the other, the restraint of culture, only, keeping her from  wringing them in her anguish. Dr. Harkins, the village physician,  stood at the foot of the bed, his honest face set in strong lines in  anticipation of the worst. Many scenes of suffering had rendered him  only more sympathetic with human sorrow, sympathetic with the real,  increasingly intolerant of the false. At the bed-side stood the  expert, who had come so far, at so great an expense-long, rough miles  by auto that a few hours might be saved-who had come, they all  believed, to decide the fate of the beloved girl who lay so death-like  before them.    Ruth Rivers was the only one in the room who was not keenly alert or  distressingly tense. Even in her waxy whiteness and unnatural  emaciation, her face was good. The forehead was high and, with the  symmetrical black eyebrows and long, dark lashes, suggested at a  glance the good quality of her breeding. The aquiline nose was pinched  by suffering, the finely curving lips were now bloodless and drawn  tight from time to time, as though to repress the cry of pain; these  marks of suffering could not rob her countenance of its refinement.  Her breathing was shallow; at times it seemed irregular; and wan,  almost inert, the fragile figure seemed nearing the eternal parting  with its soul. The silence of the sick-room was fearsomely ominous.    Three weeks before, Ruth, her mother, and ever-apprehensive Aunt  Melissa had come from the heat of coastal Georgia to the invigorating  coolness of the Southern Appalachians. They had come to Point View  several weeks later than usual this year, as spring was tardy and the  hot days at home had been few. Ruth had been most miserable for weeks  before they left home, but had stood the trip well, and Judge Rivers  had received an encouraging, indeed a hopeful report from the invalid.  But a few days later a letter telling of another of Ruth's attacks was  followed immediately by an urgent, distressed telegram which caused  him to adjourn court and hasten to his family.    For many years Dr. Harkins had driven through the mountains eight  starving months, serving and saving the poorly housed and often  destitute mountaineers. The tourist flood from the burning, summer  lowlands to the mountains' refreshment gave him his living. Dr.  Harkins was as truly a missionary as though he were on the pay-roll of  a denominational society. He had always helped, or the mountains had  helped, or something had helped Ruth before, but this time nothing  helped. The doctor had already called a neighboring physician; they  were both perplexed, and each feared to say the word which, in their  minds, spelled her doom. For nearly three days Ruth had been  delirious, this gentle, sensible, reserved girl, tossing and calling  out. A few times she had even screamed, and her mother always said  that she had been \"too fine a baby to even cry out loud.\" For five  nights there had been no sleep save an unnatural stupor produced by  medicine. Mother and nurse had"]]]
