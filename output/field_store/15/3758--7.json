You will say  she is still the heiress of a portion of our estates, but who can  say how long the estates will remain after the title is gone? Just  as the gentlemen of the pave object to titles because they have  none themselves, so being penniless they will object to property,  and for aught I know may decree a general division of lands and  goods.\"    \"Impossible, Edouard!\"    \"Not at all impossible, Julie. The beggars are on horseback, and  they intend to ride. Last week I called in from my bankers, all  the cash at my disposal, about five thousand louis, and to-morrow  du Tillet is going to start for Holland. He will hand it over to  a banker there to forward to Dr. Sandwith, to whom I have written  asking him to undertake the charge. If you will take my advice you  will forward at the same time all your jewelry. If things go wrong  it will keep us in our old age and furnish a dot for our daughters.    \"The jewels of the St. Caux have always been considered as equal  to those of any family in France, and are certainly worth half a  million francs even to sell. Keep a few small trinkets, and send  all the others away.  But I have wandered from my subject. Under  these circumstances I think it as well that we should not interfere  in the matter you speak of. Personally one could not wish for a  better husband for one of our daughters than this young Englishman  would make.    \"His father is a gentleman, and so is he, and in such times as  are coming I should be glad to know that one of my girls had such  a protector as he would make her; but this is, as you said at first,  almost ridiculous. He is two years older than she is, but in some  respects she is the elder; he regards her as a pretty child, and  all his thoughts are given to his studies and his sports.    \"He has something of the English barbarian left in him, and is  absolutely indifferent to Jeanne's preference. A French lad at his  age would be flattered. This English boy does not notice it, or if  he notices it regards it as an exhibition of gratitude, which he  could well dispense with, for having saved her life.    \"You can leave them with a tranquil heart, my dear. I will answer  for it that never in his inmost heart has the idea of his ever  making love to Jeanne occurred to this English lad. Lastly I should  be sorry for him to leave, because his good spirits and cheerfulness  are invaluable at present. Ernest is apt to be gloomy and depressed,  and cheerfulness is at a premium in France at present. Moreover,  should there be any difficulty or danger while we are absent I trust  very much to that lad's good sense and courage. That incident of  the dog showed how quick he is to plan and how prompt to carry his  plans into effect. It may seem absurd when there are several of  our staunch and tried friends here to rely in  any way on a lad,  but I do so.  Not, of course, as before our faithful friends, but  as one whose aid is not to be despised.\"    Thus it happened that on the same day that the marquis started for  Paris, M. du Tillet set out from the chateau taking with him some  trunks and packages which appeared but of little value and were  not likely to attract attention, but which contained a considerable  sum of money and the famous St. Caux jewels.    Life at the chateau was dull after the departure of its heads.  They  had few visitors now; the most frequent among them being Victor  de Gisons. The estates of the duke, his father, adjoined those of  the marquis, and between him and Marie a marriage had long before  been arranged by their parents. For once the inclination of the  young people agreed with the wishes of the elders, and they were  warmly attached to each other. No formal betrothal, however, had  as yet taken place, the troubles of the times having caused its  postponement, although formerly it had been understood that in the  present autumn the marriage should be celebrated.    The young count had at the assembly of the States General been  a prominent liberal, and had been one of those who had taken his  seat with the third estate and had voted for the abolition of the  special privileges of the nobility, but the violence of the Assembly  had alarmed and disgusted him, and in the winter he had left Paris  and returned to his father's estates.    Ernest and Harry studied with the abbe, and fenced and rode as usual  with M. du Tillet after his return from Holland. The ever-darkening  cloud weighed upon their  spirits, and yet life at the chateau was  pleasant. The absence of their parents and the general feeling of  anxiety knit the rest of the family closer together. Much of the  ceremonial observance which had, on his first arrival, surprised  and amused Harry was now laid aside. Marie, happy in the visits  of her lover and at the prospect of her approaching marriage, did  her best to make the house cheerful. Harry, who had not much liked  her at first, now found her most pleasant and agreeable, and the  younger girls walked in the grounds with their brothers and chatted  when they were gathered in the evening just as Harry's sisters had  done at home. Jeanne was, if the group broke up, generally Harry's  companion. Ever since the affair of the mad dog she had treated  him as her special friend, adopting all his  opinions and falling  in with any suggestion he might make with a readiness which caused  Ernest one day to say laughingly to Harry:    \"One would think, Harry that you were Jeanne's elder brother, not  I. She listens to you with a good deal more deference than she does  to me.\"    The winter came and went. From time to time letters arrived from  Paris, but the news was always in the same strain. Things were going  worse and worse, the king was little more than a prisoner in the  hands of the people of Paris. The violence of the Assembly was  ever on the increase, the mob of Paris were the real masters of  the situation, the greater part of the nobility had fled, and any  who appeared in the streets were liable to insult.    The feeling in the provinces kept pace with that in Paris.  Committees  were formed in every town and village and virtually superseded the  constituted authorities. Numbers of chateaux were burned, and the  peasants almost universally refused any longer to pay the dues to  their seigneurs. But at present none dreamt of personal danger.  The nobles who emigrated did so because they found the situation  intolerable, and hoped that an army would be shortly raised and  set in motion by foreign powers to put down the movement which  constituted a danger to kings, nobles, and property all over Europe.  But as yet there was nothing to foreshadow the terrible events  which were to take place, or to indicate that a movement, which  began in the just demand of an oppressed people for justice and  fair treatment, would end in that people becoming a bloodthirsty  rabble, eager to destroy all who were above them in birth, education,  or intellect.    Therefore, although the Marquis de St. Caux foresaw the possibility  of confiscation of the property and abolition of all the privileges  of the nobility, he was under no uneasiness whatever as to the  safety of his children.  His instructions were precise: that if a  small party of peasants attacked the chateau, and it was evident  that a successful resistance could be made, M. du Tillet should  send word down to the mayor of Dijon and ask for help, and should,  with the servants of the chateau, defend it; if it was attacked by  a large mob, no resistance was to be offered, but he was to abandon  it at once and journey to Paris with the children. But the time  went on without disturbance. In Dijon as elsewhere a  committee  had been formed and had taken into its hands the entire control of  the management of the town. At its head was the son of the mayor,  Monsieur Lebat.    \"I do not understand that young fellow,\" M. du Tillet said one day  on his return from Dijon. \"I do not like him; he is ambitious and  pushing, he is the leader of the advanced party in Dijon, and is  in communication with the most violent spirits in Paris, but I am  bound to say that he appears most anxious to be of service to the  family. Whenever I see him he assures me of his devotion to the  marquis. To-day, Mademoiselle Marie, he prayed me to assure you  that you need feel no uneasiness, for that he held the mob in his  hand, and would answer for it that no hostile movement should be  made against the chateau, and in fact I know, for I have taken the  precaution of buying the services of a man who is upon the committee,  that Lebat has actually exerted himself to benefit us.    \"It has several times been urged by the most violent section that  the mob should be incited to attack the chateau, but he has each  time successfully opposed the proposition. He has declared that while  no one is more hostile than himself to the privileges of seigneury,  and while he would not only abolish the nobles as a class but  confiscate their possessions, he considers that in the case of the  marquis nothing should be done until a decree to that effect is  passed by the Assembly.    \"Until that time, he argues, the people should discriminate.  The  chateaux of tyrants should be everywhere levelled to the ground,  but it would be unworthy of the people to take measures of vengeance  against those who have not notably ground down those dependent upon  them, and that, as the marquis has not pushed the privilege of his  class to the utmost, his chateau and property should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#11)"],[1,"is necessary is to take the railroad, which conveys you to Cresco, in  Monroe County, Pa., and a ride or drive of five miles through the  Pocono Mountains will land you in the little village of Canadensis, in  the valley of the Brodhead; and within the radius of a few miles on  either side fully a dozen other unposted streams ripple along in their  natural state, not boarded, bridged, dammed, or fenced by the hand of  man, thanks to the naturally uncultivatable condition of the greater  part of this paradise for trout fishers. The villagers of Canadensis  do their trading and receive their mail at Cresco, and it is an easy  matter to obtain excellent food and lodgings for a dollar a day at one  of the many farmhouses dotting here and there the valleys, and a seat  when needful in one of the several private conveyances running every  day between the two villages.    The open season for trout in Pennsylvania is from April 15th until  July 15th, and there appears to be no particularly favored period  during these three months, for the trout here afford sport equally  well at all times, though they greatly vary in their tastes for the  fly.    If the angler goes there in the early part of the open season, when  the weather is cold, he should engage a room and take his meals at the  farmhouse selected; but if the trip is made in the early part of June  or any time after that, during the open season, camp life may be  enjoyed with great comfort.    Two favorite waters within walking distance from any of the farmhouses  in Canadensis are Stony Run and the Buckhill. The great Brodhead, a  famous old water in the days of Thaddeus Norris, and noted then and  now for its big trout, flows in the valley proper, within a stone's  throw of the farmhouse at which I engaged quarters. Spruce Cabin Run,  a mile distant, is a charming stream, but the trout here are not very  large beyond the deep pools at the foot of Spruce Falls and in the  water flowing through Turner's fields and woods above the falls.    Any of these streams will afford plenty of sport, but if one wishes to  visit a still more wild, romantic, and beautiful trout water, he has  only to walk a little farther or take a buckboard wagon and ride to  the mighty Bushkill, a stream that must not be confounded with the  Buckhill, which lies in an opposite direction from Canadensis.    The Bushkill is the wildest stream in the region, and is fished less  than any of the others named, one reason being that there are plenty  of trout in the waters of Canadensis which can be fished without the  Angler going so far. For those who like to camp, the Bushkill is the  proper locality. I spent a day there with friends one season, and we  caught in less than two hours, in the liveliest possible manner, all  the trout five of us could eat throughout the day, and four dozen  extra large ones which we took home to send to friends in the city.    \"The trout in the Bushkill,\" remarked one of my companions, \"are so  wild that they're tame\"--an expression based upon the greediness and  utter disregard of the enemy with which _fontinalis_, in his  unfamiliarity with man, took the fly. I remember having a number of  rises within two feet of my legs as I was taking in my line for a  front toss.    I know men who have many times traveled a thousand miles from New York  on an angling trip to different famous waters who have not found  either the sport or the scenery to be enjoyed on the Bushkill.    The lower Brodhead below the point at which this stream and Spruce  Cabin Run come together is very beautiful. It is owned by a farmer who  lives on its banks, and who has never been known to refuse Anglers  permission to fish there when they asked for the privilege.    There are four natural features in the scenery about Canadensis that  are especially prized by the countrymen there--the Sand Spring,  Buckhill Falls, Spruce Cabin Falls, and the Bushkill Falls.    The Sand Spring is so called because grains of brilliant sand spring  up with the water. This sand resembles a mixture of gold and silver  dust; it forms in little clouds just under the water's bubble and then  settles down to form and rise again and again. This effect, with the  rich colors of wild pink roses, tiny yellow watercups, blue lilies,  and three shades of green in the cresses and deer tongue that grow all  about, produces a pretty picture. The spring is not over a foot in  diameter, but the sand edges and the pool cover several feet. In  drinking the water, strange to say, one does not take any sand with  it.    Being located at one side of the old road between Cresco and  Canadensis every visitor has an opportunity of seeing it without going  more than a few feet out of his direct way. Some of the stories told  about the old Sand Spring are worth hearing, and no one can tell them  better or with more special pleasure than the farmers living  thereabout. One man affirms that \"more 'an a hundred b'ar and as many  deer have been killed while drinking the crystal water of the spring.\"    Each of the falls is a picture of true wild scenery. Though some miles  apart they may be here described in the same paragraph.    Great trees have fallen over the water from the banks and lodged on  huge projecting moss-covered rocks; they are additional obstacles to  the rushing, roaring, down-pouring water, which flows through and over  them like melted silver. This against the dark background of the  mountain woods, the blue and snow-white of the heavens, the green of  the rhododendron-lined banks, and the streams' bottoms of all-colored  stones creates a series of charming and ever-varying views.    A half dozen trout, weighing from one to two pounds and a half, may  always be seen about the huge rock at the point where the lower  Brodhead and the Spruce Cabin Run come together, and hundreds may be  seen in the stream below the Buckhill Falls. I do not know that fish  may be actually seen in any other parts of the waters of Canadensis,  but at these points the water is calm and the bottom smooth, and the  specimens are plainly in view.    Do not waste time on the \"flock\" lying about the big rock at Brodhead  Point. The trout there will deceive you. I played with them a half  day, and before I began work on them I felt certain I would have them  in my creel in a half-hour's time. They are a pack of pampered idlers  who do not have to move a fin to feed. All the trout food comes  rushing down both streams from behind these big rocks into the silent  water and floats right up to the very noses of these gentlemen of  leisure. If you have any practicing to do with the rod and fly do it  here. These trout are very obliging; they will lie there all day and  enjoy your casting all sorts of things at them. This is a good place  to prove to yourself whether you are a patient fisherman or not.    And now a few words about the proper tackle for mountain streams. Most  anglers use rods that are too heavy and too long. During my first  visit I used a rod of eight feet, four ounces, and I soon found that,  while it was a nice weight, it was too long for real convenience,  although there were rods used there nine and ten feet long. My rod was  the lightest and one of the shortest ever seen in the valley. There  are only a few open spots where long casts are necessary, and a long,  ordinary-weight trout rod is of very little service compared with one  of seven, seven and a half, or eight feet, four or three ounces, that  can be handled well along the narrow, bush-lined, tree-branch-covered  streams.    The greater part of the fishing is done by sneaking along under cover  of the rocks, logs, bushes, and the low-hanging branches, as casts are  made in every little pool and eddy. I use a lancewood rod, but of  course the higher-priced popular split bamboo is just as good. I shall  not claim my rod's material is the better of the two, as some men do  when speaking of their tackle, but I am quite sure I shall never say  the split bamboo is more than its equal. I do not advise as to the  material; I speak only of the weight and length. Let every man use his  choice, but I seriously advise him to avoid the cheap-priced split  bamboo rod.    If split bamboo is the choice, let it be the work of a practical  rod-maker. Any ordinary wood rod is better than the four-dollar split  bamboo affair.    The leader should be of single gut, but the length should be a trifle  more than is commonly used. Twelve feet is my favorite amount. The  reel should be the lightest common click reel; the creel, a willow one  that sells for a dollar in the stores; and the flies--here's the  rub--must be the smallest and finest in the market. Large, cheap,  coarse flies will never do for Eastern waters, and you must not fail  to secure your list of the proper kind, as well as all your outfit,  before you start on your trip. The only decent thing on sale in the  village stores is tobacco.    When you buy your flies buy lots of them, for, be you a tyro or  practical Angler, you will lose them easier on these streams than you  imagine. Yes, you must be very careful about the selection of your  flies. They must be small and finely made, high-priced goods. I wish  I might tell you who to have make them, but I dare not, lest I be  charged with advertising a particular house. Regarding the patterns to  use, I will say that none are more killing than the general list, if  they are the best made and used according to the old rule all are  familiar with--dark colors on cold days and bright ones on warm days.  The later the season the louder the fly--that is, when the season  closes during hot weather, as it does in Canadensis. My favorite time  here is from June 15th to July 15th, the closing day, but any time  after the first two weeks of the open season is very charming. I avoid  the first week or two because the weather is then cold and the trout  are more fond of natural bait than the"]]]
