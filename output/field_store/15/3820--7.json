The signs  of sorrow and mourning, though arbitrary, affect us with melancholy; but  the natural symptoms, tears and cries and groans, never fail to infuse  compassion and uneasiness. And if the effects of misery touch us in so  lively a manner; can we be supposed altogether insensible or indifferent  towards its causes; when a malicious or treacherous character and  behaviour are presented to us?    We enter, I shall suppose, into a convenient, warm, well-contrived  apartment: We necessarily receive a pleasure from its very survey;  because it presents us with the pleasing ideas of ease, satisfaction,  and enjoyment. The hospitable, good-humoured, humane landlord appears.  This circumstance surely must embellish the whole; nor can we easily  forbear reflecting, with pleasure, on the satisfaction which results to  every one from his intercourse and good-offices.    His whole family, by the freedom, ease, confidence, and calm enjoyment,  diffused over their countenances, sufficiently express their happiness.  I have a pleasing sympathy in the prospect of so much joy, and can never  consider the source of it, without the most agreeable emotions.    He tells me, that an oppressive and powerful neighbour had attempted  to dispossess him of his inheritance, and had long disturbed all his  innocent and social pleasures. I feel an immediate indignation arise in  me against such violence and injury.    But it is no wonder, he adds, that a private wrong should proceed from a  man, who had enslaved provinces, depopulated cities, and made the field  and scaffold stream with human blood. I am struck with horror at the  prospect of so much misery, and am actuated by the strongest antipathy  against its author.    In general, it is certain, that, wherever we go, whatever we reflect on  or converse about, everything still presents us with the view of human  happiness or misery, and excites in our breast a sympathetic movement  of pleasure or uneasiness. In our serious occupations, in our careless  amusements, this principle still exerts its active energy.    A man who enters the theatre, is immediately struck with the view of  so great a multitude, participating of one common amusement; and  experiences, from their very aspect, a superior sensibility or  disposition of being affected with every sentiment, which he shares with  his fellow-creatures.    He observes the actors to be animated by the appearance of a full  audience, and raised to a degree of enthusiasm, which they cannot  command in any solitary or calm moment.    Every movement of the theatre, by a skilful poet, is communicated, as  it were by magic, to the spectators; who weep, tremble, resent, rejoice,  and are inflamed with all the variety of passions, which actuate the  several personages of the drama.    Where any event crosses our wishes, and interrupts the happiness of the  favourite characters, we feel a sensible anxiety and concern. But where  their sufferings proceed from the treachery, cruelty, or tyranny of an  enemy, our breasts are affected with the liveliest resentment against  the author of these calamities. It is here esteemed contrary to the  rules of art to represent anything cool and indifferent. A distant  friend, or a confident, who has no immediate interest in the  catastrophe, ought, if possible, to be avoided by the poet; as  communicating a like indifference to the audience, and checking the  progress of the passions.    Few species of poetry are more entertaining than PASTORAL; and every  one is sensible, that the chief source of its pleasure arises from those  images of a gentle and tender tranquillity, which it represents in its  personages, and of which it communicates a like sentiment to the reader.  Sannazarius, who transferred the scene to the sea-shore, though he  presented the most magnificent object in nature, is confessed to have  erred in his choice. The idea of toil, labour, and danger, suffered by  the fishermen, is painful; by an unavoidable sympathy, which attends  every conception of human happiness or misery.    When I was twenty, says a French poet, Ovid was my favourite: Now I am  forty, I declare for Horace. We enter, to be sure, more readily into  sentiments, which resemble those we feel every day: But no passion, when  well represented, can be entirely indifferent to us; because there is  none, of which every man has not, within him, at least the seeds and  first principles. It is the business of poetry to bring every affection  near to us by lively imagery and representation, and make it look like  truth and reality: A certain proof, that, wherever that reality is  found, our minds are disposed to be strongly affected by it.    Any recent event or piece of news, by which the fate of states,  provinces, or many individuals is affected, is extremely interesting  even to those whose welfare is not immediately engaged. Such  intelligence is propagated with celerity, heard with avidity, and  enquired into with attention and concern. The interest of society  appears, on this occasion, to be in some degree the interest of each  individual. The imagination is sure to be affected; though the passions  excited may not always be so strong and steady as to have great  influence on the conduct and behaviour.    The perusal of a history seems a calm entertainment; but would be  no entertainment at all, did not our hearts beat with correspondent  movements to those which are described by the historian.    Thucydides and Guicciardin support with difficulty our attention; while  the former describes the trivial encounters of the small cities of  Greece, and the latter the harmless wars of Pisa. The few persons  interested and the small interest fill not the imagination, and engage  not the affections. The deep distress of the numerous Athenian army  before Syracuse; the danger which so nearly threatens Venice; these  excite compassion; these move terror and anxiety.    The indifferent, uninteresting style of Suetonius, equally with the  masterly pencil of Tacitus, may convince us of the cruel depravity of  Nero or Tiberius: But what a difference of sentiment! While the former  coldly relates the facts; and the latter sets before our eyes the  venerable figures of a Soranus and a Thrasea, intrepid in their fate,  and only moved by the melting sorrows of their friends and kindred. What  sympathy then touches every human heart! What indignation against the  tyrant, whose causeless fear or unprovoked malice gave rise to such  detestable barbarity!    If we bring these subjects nearer: If we remove all suspicion of fiction  and deceit: What powerful concern is excited, and how much superior,  in many instances, to the narrow attachments of self-love and private  interest! Popular sedition, party zeal, a devoted obedience to factious  leaders; these are some of the most visible, though less laudable  effects of this social sympathy in human nature.    The frivolousness of the subject too, we may observe, is not able to  detach us entirely from what carries an image of human sentiment and  affection.    When a person stutters, and pronounces with difficulty, we even  sympathize with this trivial uneasiness, and suffer for him. And it is a  rule in criticism, that every combination of syllables or letters, which  gives pain to the organs of speech in the recital, appears also from a  species of sympathy harsh and disagreeable to the ear. Nay, when we  run over a book with our eye, we are sensible of such unharmonious  composition; because we still imagine, that a person recites it to us,  and suffers from the pronunciation of these jarring sounds. So delicate  is our sympathy!    Easy and unconstrained postures and motions are always beautiful: An  air of health and vigour is agreeable: Clothes which warm, without  burthening the body; which cover, without imprisoning the limbs, are  well-fashioned. In every judgement of beauty, the feelings of the person  affected enter into consideration, and communicate to the spectator  similar touches of pain or pleasure.           [Footnote: 'Decentior equus cujus astricta suntilia; sed idem  velocior. Pulcher aspectu sit athleta, cujus lacertos execitatio  expressit; idem certamini paratior nunquam enim SPECIES ab UTILITATE  dividitur. Sed hoc quidem discernere modici judicii est.'--Quintilian,  Inst. lib. viii. cap. 3.]    What wonder, then, if we can pronounce no judgement concerning the  character and conduct of men, without considering the tendencies of  their actions, and the happiness or misery which thence arises to  society? What association of ideas would ever operate, were that  principle here totally unactive.           [Footnote: In proportion to the station which a man possesses,  according to the relations in which he is placed; we always expect from  him a greater or less degree of good, and when disappointed, blame his  inutility; and much more do we blame him, if any ill or prejudice  arise from his conduct and behaviour. When the interests of one country  interfere with those of another, we estimate the merits of a statesman  by the good or ill, which results to his own country from his measures  and councils, without regard to the prejudice which he brings on its  enemies and rivals. His fellow-citizens are the objects, which lie  nearest the eye, while we determine his character. And as nature has  implanted in every one a superior affection to his own country, we never  expect any regard to distant nations, where a competition arises. Not to  mention, that, while every man consults the good of his own community,  we are sensible, that the general interest of mankind is better  promoted, than any loose indeterminate views to the good of a species,  whence no beneficial action could ever result, for want of a duly  limited object, on which they could exert themselves.]    If any man from a cold insensibility, or narrow selfishness"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43282"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.No. 6.

[Illustration: =CUTTING AND BORING ATTACHMENT FOR LATHES.=]    This valve affords a ready means of supplying dry steam to sulphuric  acid chambers. We are informed that by its use a chamber in ordinary  working order will produce acid 3 deg. to 5 deg. Baume stronger than can be  obtained with ordinary globe valves. Thirty steam pipes, arranged at  different points, are found to deliver into a chamber in the space of  five minutes from 4 to 16 ounces of condense water (according to the  circumstances of distance, temperature of the air, size of pipe, etc.).  These valves, being placed close to the chamber separating all the  condense water, deliver with certainty uniformly dry steam, without the  inconvenience of ordinary steam traps or other expensive appliances.    This valve was patented through the Scientific American Patent Agency,  May 21, 1878. For further particulars address Mr. Joseph Saunders, 975  Third avenue, Brooklyn, N.

It consists in two detachable clamping plates, which hold the plow  beams, and their arrangement with respect to the said beams and the  handles of the plow, whereby a single bolt is made to secure the forward  ends of the handles and clamp the plates to hold the plow beams in  place.    Russel O. Bean, of Macedonia, Miss., is the inventor of an improved Seed  Planter for planting cotton and other seeds, and for distributing  fertilizers. The details of the construction of this planter cannot be  explained without engravings.    Rutus Sarlls and Alexander Kelman, of Navasota, Texas, have invented an  improved combined Planter, Cultivator, and Cotton Chopper, which may be  readily adjusted for use in planting seed, cultivating plants, and  chopping cotton to a stand, and is effective and reliable in operation  in either capacity.    William H. Akens, of Penn Line, Pa., is the inventor of an improved  Dropper, for attachment to the finger bar of a reaper, to receive the  grain and deliver it in gavels at the side of the machine, so as to be  out of the way when making the next round. It is so constructed that  when attached to the finger bar of a mower it will convert it into a  harvester.    James Goodheart, of Matawan, N. J., has devised an improved machine for  Distributing Poison upon potato plants to destroy the potato bug. It may  also be used for sowing seeds.    William V. McConnell and Charles M. Dickerson, of Crockett, Texas, have  invented an improved Fruit Picker, having cup-shaped self-opening spring  jaws attached to its handle, and operated by a cord to close upon and  clamp the fruit. It also has a hollow extensible adjustable handle and a  fruit receiver.           *       *       *       *       *                                       =Quick Work.=    Two years ago a farmer-miller and his wife, at Carrolton, Mo., furnished  some invited guests with bread baked in eight and a quarter minutes from  the time the wheat was standing in the field. This year it was  determined to make still better time. Accordingly elaborate preparations  were made to reap, thrash, grind, and bake the grain with the least  possible loss of time.    In 1 minute 15 seconds the wheat, about a peck, was cut and thrashed,  and put on the back of a swift horse to be carried to the mill, 16 rods  away. In 2 minutes 17 seconds the flour was delivered to Mrs. Lawton,  and in 3m. 55s. from the starting of the reaper the first griddle cake  was done. In 4 minutes 37 seconds from the starting of the reaper, a pan  of biscuits was delivered to the assembled guests.    After that, according to the Carrolton _Democrat_, other pans of  delicious \"one minute\" biscuits were baked more at leisure, and eagerly  devoured, with the usual accompaniment of boiled ham and speech making.           *       *       *       *       *                                 =THE RHINOCEROS HORNBILL.=    [Illustration: =THE RHINOCEROS HORNBILL.=]    There are many strange and wonderful forms among the feathered tribes;  but there are, perhaps, none which more astonish the beholder who sees  them for the first time than the group of birds known by the name of  hornbills. They are all distinguished by a very large beak, to which is  added a singular helmet-like appendage, equaling in size the beak itself  in some species, while in others it is so small as to attract but little  notice. On account of the enormous size of the beak and helmet, the bird  appears to be overweighted by the mass of horny substance which it has  to carry, but on closer investigation the whole structure is found to be  singularly light and yet very strong, the whole interior being composed  of numerous honeycombed cells with very thin walls and wide spaces, the  walls being so arranged as to give very great strength when the bill is  used for biting, and with a very slight expenditure of material.    The greatest development of beak and helmet is found in the rhinoceros  hornbill, although there are many others which have these appendages of  great size. The beak varies greatly in proportion to the age of the  individual, the helmet being almost imperceptible when it is first  hatched, and the bill not very striking in dimensions. The beak gains in  size as the bird gains in strength. In the adult the helmet and beak  attain their full proportions. It is said that a wrinkle is added every  year to the number of the furrows found on the bill. The object of the  helmet is obscure, but the probability is that it may aid the bird in  producing the loud roaring cry for which it is so celebrated. The  hornbill is lively and active, leaping from bough to bough with great  lightness, and appearing not to be in the least incommoded by its huge  beak. Its flight is laborious, and when in the air the bird has a habit  of clattering its great mandibles together, which together with the  noise of the wings produces a weird sound. The food of the hornbill  seems to consist of both animal and vegetable matters. We take our  illustration from Wood's \"Natural History.\"           *       *       *       *       *                              =Saw Tempering by Natural Gas.=    Beaver Falls, Pa., contains several gas wells at an average depth of  eleven hundred feet, yielding about 100,000 cubic feet of gas every  twenty-four hours. This gas has been introduced into a large saw  tempering furnace at that place in the works of Emerson, Smith & Co. The  furnace is 8 feet wide by 14 feet long. It is said to be a perfect  success, giving a uniform heat, and there being no sulphur or impurity  in the gas the steel is not deteriorated in the operation of heating.           *       *       *       *       *                      =THE JAPANESE BUILDING AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION.=    [Illustration: =THE JAPANESE BUILDING AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION.=]    Japan, on the terrestrial globe, lies furthest away in that direction  beyond the Far West of America, and beyond the wide Pacific. The  Japanese structure has a simple and solid aspect, resembling the portal  of a half-fortified mansion, with massive timber frames at the sides;  but it is adorned with two handsome porcelain fountains, and each of  these is designed to represent the stump of a tree supporting a shell  into which the water is poured from a large flower.
