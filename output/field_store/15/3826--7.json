Are the sea devils their cousins?\" asked Trot.    \"Yes, and they are the only creatures of the ocean which we greatly  fear,\" replied Aquareine. \"I hope we shall meet none today, for we  are going near to the dismal caverns where they live.\"    \"What are the sea devils like, ma'am?\" inquired Cap'n Bill a little  uneasily.    \"Something like the octopus you just saw, only much larger and of a  bright scarlet color, striped with black,\" answered the Queen. \"They  are very fierce and terrible creatures and nearly as much dreaded by  the inhabitants of the ocean as is Zog, and nearly as powerful as  King Anko himself.\"    \"Zog! Who is Zog?\" questioned the girl. \"I haven't heard of him  before now.\"    \"We do not like to mention Zog's name,\" responded the Queen in a low  voice. \"He is the wicked genius of the sea, and a magician of great  power.\"    \"What's he like?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"He is a dreadful creature, part fish, part man, part beast and part  serpent. Centuries ago they cast him off the earth into the sea,  where he has caused much trouble. Once he waged a terrible war  against King Anko, but the sea serpent finally conquered Zog and  drove the magician into his castle, where he now stays shut up. For  if ever Anko catches the monster outside of his enchanted castle, he  will kill him, and Zog knows that very well.\"    \"Seems like you have your troubles down here just as we do on top  the ground,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.    \"But I'm glad old Zog is shut up in his castle,\" added Trot. \"Is it  a sea castle like your own palace?\"    \"I cannot say, my dear, for the enchantment makes it invisible to  all eyes but those of its inhabitants,\" replied Aquareine. \"No one  sees Zog now, and we scarcely ever hear of him, but all the sea  people know he is here someplace and fear his power. Even in the old  days, before Anko conquered him, Zog was the enemy of the mermaids,  as he was of all the good and respectable seafolk. But do not worry  about the magician, I beg of you, for he has not dared to do an evil  deed in many, many years.\"    \"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" asserted Trot.    \"I'm glad of that,\" said the Queen. \"Keep together, friends, and be  careful not to separate, for here comes an army of sawfishes.\"    Even as Aquareine spoke, they saw a swirl and commotion in the water  ahead of them, while a sound like a muffled roar fell upon their  ears. Then swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes  with long saws sticking out in front of their noses, armed with  sharp, hooked teeth, all set in a row. They were larger than the  swordfishes and seemed more fierce and bold. But the mermaids and  Trot and Cap'n Bill quietly awaited their attack, and instead of  tearing them with their saws as they expected to do, the fishes were  unable to touch them at all. They tried every possible way to get at  their proposed victims, but the Magic Circle was all powerful and  turned aside the ugly saws; so our friends were not disturbed at  all. Seeing this, the sawfishes soon abandoned the attempt and with  growls and roars of disappointment swam away and were quickly out of  sight.    Trot had been a wee bit frightened during the attack, but now she  laughed gleefully and told the queen that it seemed very nice to be  protected by fairy powers. The water grew a darker blue as they  descended into its depths, farther and farther away from the rays of  the sun. Trot was surprised to find she could see so plainly through  the high wall of water above her, but the sun was able to shoot its  beams straight down through the transparent sea, and they seemed to  penetrate to every nook and crevice of the rocky bottom.    In this deeper part of the ocean some of the fishes had a  phosphorescent light of their own, and these could be seen far ahead  as if they were lanterns. The explorers met a school of argonauts  going up to the surface for a sail, and the child watched these  strange creatures with much curiosity. The argonauts live in shells  in which they are able to hide in case of danger from prowling wolf  fishes, but otherwise they crawl out and carry their shells like  humps upon their backs. Then they spread their skinny sails above  them and sail away under water till they come to the surface, where  they float and let the currents of air carry them along the same as  the currents of water had done before. Trot thought the argonauts  comical little creatures, with their big eyes and sharp noses, and  to her they looked like a fleet of tiny ships.    It is said that men got their first idea of boats and of how to sail  them from watching these little argonauts.          CHAPTER 10    THE UNDISCOVERED ISLAND      In following the fleet of argonauts, the four explorers had risen  higher in the water and soon found they had wandered to an open  space that seemed to Trot like the flat top of a high hill. The  sands were covered with a growth of weeds so gorgeously colored that  one who had never peered beneath the surface of the sea would  scarcely believe they were not the product of a dye shop. Every  known hue seemed represented in the delicate, fern-like leaves that  swayed softly to and fro as the current moved them. They were not  set close together, these branches of magnificent hues, but were  scattered sparsely over the sandy bottom of the sea so that while  from a distance they seemed thick, a nearer view found them spread  out with ample spaces of sand between them.    In these sandy spaces lay the real attractiveness of the place, for  here were many of those wonders of the deep that have surprised and  interested people in all ages.    First were the starfishes--hundreds of them, it seemed--lying  sleepily on the bottom, with their five or six points extended  outward. They were of various colors, some rich and brilliant,  others of dark brown hues. A few had wound their arms around the  weeds or were creeping slowly from one place to another, in the  latter case turning their points downward and using them as legs.  But most of them were lying motionless, and as Trot looked down upon  them she thought they resembled stars in the sky on a bright night,  except that the blue of the heavens was here replaced by the white  sand, and the twinkling diamond stars by the colored starfish.    \"We are near an island,\" said the Queen, \"and that is why so many  starfishes are here, as they love to keep close to shore. Also the  little seahorses love these weeds, and to me they are more  interesting than the starfish.\"    Trot now noticed the seahorses for the first time. They were quite  small--merely two or three inches high--but had funny little heads  that were shaped much like the head of a horse, and bright,  intelligent eyes. They had no legs, though, for their bodies ended  in tails which they twined around the stems of seaweeds to support  themselves and keep the currents from carrying them away.    Trot bent down close to examine one of the queer little creatures  and exclaimed, \"Why, the seahorses haven't any fins or anything to  swim with.\"    \"Oh yes we have,\" replied the Sea Horse in a tiny but distinct  voice. \"These things on the side of my head are fins.\"    \"I thought they were ears,\" said the girl.    \"So they are. Fins and ears at the same time,\" answered the little  sea animal. \"Also, there are small fins on our backs. Of course, we  can't swim as the mermaids do, or even as swiftly as fishes; but we  manage to get around, thank you.\"    \"Don't the fishes catch and eat you?\" inquired Trot curiously.    \"Sometimes,\" admitted the Sea Horse, \"and there are many other  living things that have a way of destroying us. But here I am, as  you see, over six weeks old, and during that time I have escaped  every danger. That isn't so bad, is it?\"    \"Phoo!\" said a Starfish lying near. \"I'm over three months old.  You're a mere baby, Sea Horse.\"    \"I'm not!\" cried the Sea Horse excitedly. \"I'm full-grown and may  live to be as old as you are!\"    \"Not if I keep on living,\" said the Starfish calmly, and Trot knew  he was correct in his statement.    The little girl now noticed several sea spiders creeping around and  drew back because she did not think them very pretty. They were  shaped not unlike the starfishes, but had slender legs and big heads  with wicked-looking eyes sticking out of them.    \"Oh, I don't like those things!\" said Trot, coming closer to her  companions.    \"You don't, eh?\" said a big Sea Spider in a cross voice. \"Why do you  come around here, then, scaring away my dinner when you're not  wanted?\"    \"It isn't YOUR ocean,\" replied Trot.    \"No, and it isn't yours,\" snapped the Spider. \"But as it's big  enough for us both, I'd like you to go away.\"    \"So we will,\" said Aquareine gently, and at once she moved toward  the surface of the water. Trot and Cap'n Bill followed, with Clia,  and the child asked, \"What island are we near?\"    \"It has no name,\" answered the Queen, \"for it is not inhabited by  man, nor has it ever yet been discovered by them. Perhaps you will  be the first humans to see this island. But it is a barren, rocky  place, and only fit for seals and turtles.\"    \"Are any of them there now?\" Cap'n Bill inquired.    \"I think so. We will see.\"    Trot was astonished to find how near they were to the \"top\" of the  ocean, for they had not ascended through the water very long when  suddenly her head popped into the air, and she gave a gasp of  surprise to find herself looking at the clear sky for the first time  since she had started upon this adventure by rowing into Giant's  Cave.    She floated comfortably in the water, with her head and face just  out of it, and began to look around her. Cap'n Bill was at her side,  and so were the two mermaids. The day was fair, and the surface of  the sea, which stretched far away as the eye could reach, rippled  under a gentle breeze. They had risen almost at the edge of a small,  rocky islet, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],[0,"The Master Key (#11)"],[1,"thing and need  looking after, like jam in a cupboard.\"    The king smiled.    \"I hope you haven't killed my guards,\" said he.    \"Oh, no; they'll come around all right.\"    \"It is necessary,\" continued Edward, \"that public men be protected from  intrusion, no matter how democratic they may be personally.  You would  probably find it as difficult to approach the President of the United  States as the King of England.\"    \"Oh, I'm not complaining,\" said Rob.  \"It wasn't much trouble to break  through.\"    \"You seem quite young to have mastered such wonderful secrets of  Nature,\" continued the king.    \"So I am,\" replied Rob, modestly; \"but these natural forces have really  existed since the beginning of the world, and some one was sure to  discover them in time.\"  He was quoting the Demon, although  unconsciously.    \"You are an American, I suppose,\" said the minister, coming close to  Rob and staring him in the face.    \"Guessed right the first time,\" answered the boy, and drawing his  Character Marking spectacles from his pocket, he put them on and stared  at the minister in turn.    Upon the man's forehead appeared the letter \"E.\"    \"Your Majesty,\" said Rob, \"I have here another queer invention.  Will  you please wear these spectacles for a few moments?\"    The king at once put them on.    \"They are called Character Markers,\" continued the boy, \"because the  lenses catch and concentrate the character vibrations radiating from  every human individual and reflect the true character of the person  upon his forehead.  If a letter 'G' appears, you may be sure his  disposition is good; if his forehead is marked with an 'E' his  character is evil, and you must beware of treachery.\"    The king saw the \"E\" plainly marked upon his minister's forehead, but  he said nothing except \"Thank you,\" and returned the spectacles to Rob.    But the minister, who from the first had been ill at ease, now became  positively angry.    \"Do not believe him, your Majesty!\" he cried.  \"It is a trick, and  meant to deceive you.\"    \"I did not accuse you,\" answered the king, sternly.  Then he added: \"I  wish to be alone with this young gentleman.\"    The minister left the room with an anxious face and hanging head.    \"Now,\" said Rob, \"let's look over the record of the past day and see if  that fellow has been up to any mischief.\"    He turned the cylinder of the Record to \"England,\" and slowly the  events of the last twenty-four hours were reproduced, one after the  other, upon the polished plate.    Before long the king uttered an exclamation.  The Record pictured a  small room in which were seated three gentlemen engaged in earnest  conversation.  One of them was the accused minister.    \"Those men,\" said the king in a low voice, while he pointed out the  other two, \"are my avowed enemies.  This is proof that your wonderful  spectacles indicated my minister's character with perfect truth.  I am  grateful to you for thus putting me upon my guard, for I have trusted  the man fully.\"    \"Oh, don't mention it,\" replied the boy, lightly; \"I'm glad to have  been of service to you.  But it's time for me to go.\"    \"I hope you will favor me with another interview,\" said the king, \"for  I am much interested in your electrical inventions.  I will instruct my  guards to admit you at any time, so you will not be obliged to fight  your way in.\"    \"All right.  But it really doesn't matter,\" answered Rob.  \"It's no  trouble at all to knock 'em over.\"    Then he remembered his manners and bowed low before the king, who  seemed to him \"a fine fellow and not a bit stuck up.\"  And then he  walked calmly from the palace.    The people in the outer room stared at him wonderingly and the officer  of the guard saluted the boy respectfully.  But Rob only smiled in an  amused way as he marched past them with his hands thrust deep into his  trousers' pockets and his straw hat tipped jauntily upon the back of  his head.          11.  The Man of Science      Rob passed the remainder of the day wandering about London and amusing  himself by watching the peculiar ways of the people.  When it became so  dark that there was no danger of his being observed, he rose through  the air to the narrow slit in the church tower and lay upon the floor  of the little room, with the bells hanging all around him, to pass the  night.    He was just falling asleep when a tremendous din and clatter nearly  deafened him, and set the whole tower trembling.  It was the midnight  chime.    Rob clutched his ears tightly, and when the vibrations had died away  descended by the ladder to a lower platform.  But even here the next  hourly chime made his ears ring, and he kept descending from platform  to platform until the last half of a restless night was passed in the  little room at the bottom of the tower.    When, at daylight, the boy sat up and rubbed his eyes, he said,  wearily: \"Churches are all right as churches; but as hotels they are  rank failures.  I ought to have bunked in with my friend, King Edward.\"    He climbed up the stairs and the ladders again and looked out the  little window in the belfry.  Then he examined his map of Europe.    \"I believe I'll take a run over to Paris,\" he thought.  \"I must be home  again by Saturday, to meet the Demon, so I'll have to make every day  count.\"    Without waiting for breakfast, since he had eaten a tablet the evening  before, he crept through the window and mounted into the fresh morning  air until the great city with its broad waterway lay spread out beneath  him.  Then he sped away to the southeast and, crossing the channel,  passed between Amiens and Rouen and reached Paris before ten o'clock.    Near the outskirts of the city appeared a high tower, upon the flat  roof of which a man was engaged in adjusting a telescope.  Upon seeing  Rob, who was passing at no great distance from this tower, the man  cried out:    \"APPROCHEZ!--VENEZ ICI!\"    Then he waved his hands frantically in the air, and fairly danced with  excitement.  So the boy laughed and dropped down to the roof where,  standing beside the Frenchman, whose eyes were actually protruding from  their sockets, he asked, coolly:    \"Well, what do you want?\"    The other was for a moment speechless.  He was a tall, lean man, having  a bald head but a thick, iron-gray beard, and his black eyes sparkled  brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.  After  attentively regarding the boy for a time he said, in broken English:    \"But, M'sieur, how can you fly wizout ze--ze machine?  I have  experiment myself wiz some air-ship; but you--zere is nossing to make  go!\"    Rob guessed that here was his opportunity to do the Demon a favor by  explaining his electrical devices to this new acquaintance, who was  evidently a man of science.    \"Here is the secret, Professor,\" he said, and holding out his wrist  displayed the traveling machine and explained, as well as he could, the  forces that operated it.    The Frenchman, as you may suppose, was greatly astonished, and to show  how perfectly the machine worked Rob turned the indicator and rose a  short distance above the tower, circling around it before he rejoined  the professor on the roof.  Then he showed his food tablets, explaining  how each was stored with sufficient nourishment for an entire day.    The scientist positively gasped for breath, so powerful was the  excitement he experienced at witnessing these marvels.    \"Eet is wonderful--grand--magnifique!\" he exclaimed.    \"But here is something of still greater interest,\" continued Rob, and  taking the Automatic Record of Events from his pocket he allowed the  professor to view the remarkable scenes that were being enacted  throughout the civilized world.    The Frenchman was now trembling violently, and he implored Rob to tell  him where he might obtain similar electrical machines.    \"I can't do that,\" replied the boy, decidedly; \"but, having seen these,  you may be able to discover their construction for yourself.  Now that  you know such things to be possible and practical, the hint should be  sufficient to enable a shrewd electrician to prepare duplicates of  them.\"    The scientist glared at him with evident disappointment, and Rob  continued:    \"These are not all the wonders I can exhibit.  Here is another  electrical device that is, perhaps, the most remarkable of any I  possess.\"    He took the Character Marking spectacles from his pocket and fitted  them to his eyes.  Then he gave a whistle of surprise and turned his  back upon his new friend.  He had seen upon the Frenchman's forehead  the letters \"E\" and \"C.\"    \"Guess I've struck the wrong sort of scientist, after all!\" he  muttered, in a disgusted tone.    His companion was quick to prove the accuracy of the Character Marker.  Seeing the boy's back turned, he seized a long iron bar that was used  to operate the telescope, and struck at Rob so fiercely that had he not  worn the Garment of Protection his skull would have been crushed by the  blow.  At it was, the bar rebounded with a force that sent the  murderous Frenchman sprawling upon the roof, and Rob turned around and  laughed at him.    \"It won't work, Professor,\" he said.  \"I'm proof against assassins.  Perhaps you had an idea that when you had killed me you could rob me of  my valuable possessions; but they wouldn't be a particle of use to a  scoundrel like you, I assure you!  Good morning.\"    Before the surprised and baffled scientist could collect himself  sufficiently to reply, the boy was soaring far above his head and  searching for a convenient place to alight, that he might investigate  the charms of this famed city of Paris.    It was indeed a beautiful place, with many stately buildings lining the  shady boulevards.  So thronged were the streets that Rob well knew he  would soon be the center of a curious crowd should he alight upon them.  Already a few sky-gazers had noted the boy moving high in the air,  above their heads, and"]]]
