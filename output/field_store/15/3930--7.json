There is no way so good to larn French as to  live among 'em, and if you WANT TO UNDERSTAND US, YOU  MUST LIVE AMONG US, TOO; your Halls, Hamiltons, and De  Rouses, and such critters, what CAN they know of us? Can  a chap catch a likeness flying along a rail road? can he  even see the feature? Old Admiral Anson once axed one of  our folks afore our glorious Revolution, (if the British  had a known us a little grain better at that time, they  would'nt have got whipped like a sack as they did then)  where he came from. From the Chesapeeke, said he. Aye,  aye, said the Admiral, from the West Indies. I guess,  said the Southaner, you may have been clean ROUND THE  WORLD, Admiral, but you have been plaguy LITTLE IN IT,  not to know better nor that I shot a wild goose at River  Philip last year, with the rice of Varginey fresh in his  crops he must have cracked on near about as fast as them  other geese, the British travellers. Which know'd the  most of the country they passed over, do you suppose? I  guess it was much of a muchness--near about six of one  and a half dozen of tother; two eyes aint much better  than one, if they are both blind.    No, if you want to know all about us and the Blue Noses  (a pretty considerable share of Yankee blood in them too,  I tell you; the old stock comes from New England, and  the breed is tolerable pure yet, near about one half  apple sarce, and tother half molasses, all except to the  Easterd, where there is a cross of the Scotch,) jist ax  me and I'll tell you candidly. I'm not one of them that  can't see no good points in my neighbor's critter, and  no bad ones in my own; I've seen too much of the world  for that, I guess. Indeed, in a general way, I praise  other folks' beasts, and keep dark about my own. Says I,  when I meet Blue Nose mounted, that's a real smart horse  of yourn, put him out, I guess he'll trot like mad. Well,  he lets him have the spur, and the critter does his best,  and then I pass him like a streak of lightning with mine.  The feller looks all taken aback at that. Why, says he,  that's a real clipper of yourn, I vow. Middlin, says I,  (quite cool, as if I had heard that are same thing a  thousand times,) he's good enough for me, jist a fair  trotter, and nothin to brag of. That goes near about as  far agin in a general way, as a crackin and a boastin  does. Never TELL folks you can go a head on 'em, but DO  it; it spares a great deal of talk, and helps them to  save their breath to cool their broth. No, if you want  to know the inns and the outs of the Yankees--I've wintered  them and summered them; I know all their points, shape,  make and breed; I've tried 'em alongside of other folks,  and I know where they fall short, where they mate 'em,  and where they have the advantage, about as well as some  who think they know a plaguy sight more. It tante them  that stare the most, that see the best always, I guess.  Our folks have their faults, and I know them, (I warnt  born blind, I reckon,) but your friends, the tour writers,  are a little grain too hard on us. Our old nigger wench  had several dirty, ugly lookin children, and was proper  cross to 'em. Mother used to say, 'Juno, its better never  to wipe a child's nose at all, I guess, than to wring it  off.'          No. XII    The American Eagle.    Jist look out of the door, said the Clockmaker, and see  what a beautiful night it is, how calm, how still, how  clear it is, beant it lovely?--I like to look up at them  are stars, when I am away from home, they put me in mind  of our national flag, and it is generally allowed to be  the first flag in the univarse now. The British can whip  all the world, and we can whip the British. Its near  about the prettiest sight I know of, is one of our first  class Frigates, manned with our free and enlightened  citizens all ready for sea; it is like the great American  Eagle, on its perch, balancing itself for a start on the  broad expanse of blue sky, afeared of nothin of its kind,  and president of all it surveys. It was a good emblem  that we chose, warn't it? There was no evading so direct,  and at the same time, so conceited an appeal as this.  Certainly, said I, the emblem was well chosen. I was  particularly struck with it on observing the device on  your naval buttons during the last war--an eagle with an  anchor in its claws. That was a natural idea, taken from  an ordinary occurrence: a bird purloining the anchor of  a frigate--an article so useful and necessary for the  food of its young. It was well chosen, and exhibited  great taste and judgment in the artist. The emblem is  more appropriate than you are aware of--boasting of what  you cannot perform--grasping at what you cannot attain  --an emblem of arrogance and weakness--of ill-directed  ambition and vulgar pretension. Its a common phrase, said  he, (with great composure) among seamen, to say 'damn  your buttons,' and I guess its natural for you to say so  of the buttons of our navals; I guess you have a right  to that are oath. Its a sore subject, that, I reckon,  and I believe I hadn't ought to have spoken of it to you  at all. Brag is a good dog, but hold fast is a better  one. He was evidently annoyed, and with his usual  dexterity gave vent to his feelings, by a sally upon the  Blue Noses, who he says are a cross of English and Yankee,  and therefore first cousins to us both. Perhaps, said  he, that are Eagle might with more propriety have been  taken off as perched on an anchor, instead of holding it  in his claws, and I think it would have been more nateral;  but I suppose it was some stupid foreign artist that made  that are blunder, I never seed one yet that was equal to  ourn. If that Eagle is represented as trying what HE  CAN'T DO, its an honorable ambition arter all, but these  Blue Noses wont try what THEY CAN DO. They put me in mind  of a great big hulk of a horse in a cart, that wont put  his shoulder to the collar at all for all the lambastin  in the world, but turns his head round and looks at you,  as much as to say, 'what an everlastin heavy thing an  empty cart is, isnt it?' An Owl should be their emblem,  and the motto, 'He sleeps all the days of his life.' The  whole country is like this night; beautiful to look at,  but silent as the grave--still as death, asleep, becalmed.  If the sea was always calm, said he, it would pyson the  univarse; no soul could breathe the air, it would be so  uncommon bad. Stagnant water is always unpleasant, bat  salt water when it gets tainted beats all natur; motion  keeps it sweet and wholesome, and that our minister used  to say is one of the 'wonders of the great deep.' This  province is stagnant; it tante deep like still water  neither, for its shaller enough, gracious knows, but it  is motionless, noiseless, lifeless. If you have ever been  to sea, in a calm, you'd know what a plaguy tiresome  thing it is for a man that's in a hurry. An everlastin  flappin of the sails, and a creakin of the boombs, and  an onsteady pitchin of the ship, and folks lyin about  dozin away their time, and the sea a heavin a long heavy  swell, like the breathin of the chist of some great  monster asleep. A passenger wonders the sailors are so  plagy easy about it, and he goes a lookin out east, and  a spyin out west, to see if there's any chance of a  breeze, and says to himself 'Well, if this aint dull  music its a pity.' Then how streaked he feels when he  sees a steamboat a clippin it by him like mad, and the  folks on board pokin fun at him, and askin him if he has  any word to send to home. Well, he says, if any soul ever  catches me on board a sail vessel again, when I can go  by steam, I'll give him leave to tell me of it, that's  a fact. That's partly the case here. They are becalmed,  and they see us going a head on them, till we are een  amost out of sight; yet they hant got a steamboat, and  they hant got a rail road; indeed, I doubt if one half  on em ever see'd or heerd tell of one or tother of them.  I never see'd any folks like 'em except the Indians, and  they wont even so much as look--they hav'nt the least  morsel of curiosity in the world; from which one of our  Unitarian preachers (they are dreadful hands at DOUBTIN  them. I don't DOUBT but some day or another, they will  DOUBT whether every thing aint a DOUBT) in a very learned  work, doubts whether they were ever descended from Eve  at all. Old marm Eve's children, he says, are all lost,  it is said, in consequence of TOO MUCH curiosity, while  these copper colored folks are lost from havin TOO LITTLE  little. How can they be the same? Thinks I, that may be  logic, old Dubersome, but it ant sense, don't extremes  meet? Now these Blue Noses have no motion in 'em, no  enterprise, no spirit, and if any critter shows any  symptoms of activity, they say he is a man of no judgment,  he's speculative, he's a schemer, in short he's mad. They  vegitate like a lettuce plant in sarse garden, they grow  tall and, spindlin, run to seed right off, grow as bitter  as gaul and die.    A gall once came to our minister to hire as a house help;  says she, minister, I suppose you don't want a young lady  to do chamber business and breed worms do you? For I've  half a mind to take a spell of livin out (she meant, said  the Clockmaker, house work and rearing silk worms.) My  pretty maiden, says he, a pattin her on the cheek, (for  I've often observed old men always talk kinder pleasant  to young women,) my pretty maiden where was you brought  up? why, says she I guess I warnt brought up at all, I  growed up; under what platform, says he, (for he was very  particular that all his house helps should go to his  meetin,) under what Church platform? Church platform,  says she, with a toss of her bead, like a young colt  that's got a check of the curb, I guess I warnt raised  under a platform at all, but in as good a house as yourn,  grand as you be--you said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],[0,"A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#11)"],[1,"accompanied her with alacrity.    He hopped so fast that Ribby--had to run. It was most conspicuous. All  the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.    \"I KNEW they would over-eat themselves!\" said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.    But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had  happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the  fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.    \"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!\"    She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again  with a spoon.    \"No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie  except me, so I must have swallowed it!\"    She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire  crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!    Duchess started! She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich  steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,--and  through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a  little tin patty-pan!    Duchess drew a long breath--    \"Then I must have been eating MOUSE!... NO wonder I feel ill.... But  perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!\"  Duchess reflected--\"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to  Ribby! I think I will put my pie in the back-yard and say nothing about  it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.\" She put it  outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her  eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.    \"Gammon, ha, HA?\" said the doctor.    \"I am feeling very much better,\" said Duchess, waking up with a jump.    \"I am truly glad to hear it!\" He has brought you a pill, my dear  Duchess!\"    \"I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,\" said  Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in  his beak.    \"It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little  milk, my dear Duchess!\"    \"Gammon? Gammon?\" said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked.    \"Don't say that again!\" said Ribby, losing her temper--\"Here, take this  bread and jam, and get out into the yard!\"    \"Gammon and spinach! ha ha HA!\" shouted Dr. Maggotty triumphantly  outside the back door.    \"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,\" said Duchess. \"Do you  not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?\"    \"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess. I will lend you a nice warm  shawl, and you shall take my arm.\"    \"I would not trouble you for worlds; I feel wonderfully better. One pill  of Dr. Maggotty----\"    \"Indeed it is most admirable, if it has cured you of a patty-pan! I will  call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept.\"    Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started  home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone  in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round  to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.    Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The  jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of  a patty-pan.    \"Gammon, ha, HA!\" he shouted when he saw Duchess's little black nose  peeping round the corner.    Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!    When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things,  she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the  yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where Dr Maggotty had  considerately left it.    Ribby stared with amazement--\"Did you ever see the like! so there really  WAS a patty-pan?.... But my patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.  Well I never did!.... Next time I want to give a party--I will invite  Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!\"      THE END          THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK A FARMYARD TALE FOR RALPH AND BETSY      WHAT a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the  farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    HER sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to  leave the hatching to some one else--\"I have not the patience to sit on  a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would  let them go cold; you know you would!\"    \"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,\" quacked  Jemima Puddle-duck.    SHE tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.    Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest  right away from the farm.    SHE set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads  over the hill.    She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    WHEN she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.    She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill  a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    SHE flew beautifully when she had got a good start.    She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the  middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    JEMIMA alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a  convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst  some tall fox-gloves.    But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly  dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.    He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.    \"Quack?\" said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one  side--\"Quack?\"    THE gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously  at Jemima--    \"Madam, have you lost your way?\" said he. He had a long bushy tail which  he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.    Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had  not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry  nesting-place.    \"AH! is that so? indeed!\" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers,  looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in  his coat-tail pocket.    Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.    \"Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would  teach it to mind its own business!\"    \"BUT as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers  in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may  sit there as long as you like,\" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the  fox-gloves.    It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one  on top of another, by way of a chimney.    \"THIS is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter  house--so convenient,\" said the hospitable gentleman.    There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old  soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in.    THE shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating;  but it was comfortable and very soft.    Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of  feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any  trouble at all.    WHEN she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log  reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking  over the top of it.    He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for  the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came  back again next day.    He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine  nestful in his wood-shed.    JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.  They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them  immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not  there.    At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--\"and  I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest  until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,\" said the  conscientious Jemima.    \"MADAM, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide  oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you  a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!    \"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a  savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some  parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,\" said  the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and  onions made her suspicious.    She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the  different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    AND she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.    The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, \"What are you doing with those  onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima  Puddle-duck?\"    Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.    The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she  described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    HE asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position  of the house and shed.    Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two  fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny  afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions  in a bag.    She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy  long-tailed gentleman.    HE was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily  round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.    \"Come into the house "]]]
