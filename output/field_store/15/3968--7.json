Even my powerful and ferocious Woola was as helpless as a kitten  before that frightful thing.  But to flee were useless, even had  it ever been to my liking to turn my back upon a danger; so I stood  my ground, Woola snarling at my side, my only hope to die as I had  always lived--fighting.    The creature was upon us now, and at the instant there seemed to  me a single slight chance for victory.  If I could but remove the  terrible menace of certain death hidden in the poison sacs that  fed the sting the struggle would be less unequal.    At the thought I called to Woola to leap upon the creature's head  and hang there, and as his mighty jaws closed upon that fiendish  face, and glistening fangs buried themselves in the bone and  cartilage and lower part of one of the huge eyes, I dived beneath  the great body as the creature rose, dragging Woola from the ground,  that it might bring its sting beneath and pierce the body of the  thing hanging to its head.    To put myself in the path of that poison-laden lance was to court  instant death, but it was the only way; and as the thing shot  lightning-like toward me I swung my long-sword in a terrific cut  that severed the deadly member close to the gorgeously marked body.    Then, like a battering-ram, one of the powerful hind legs caught  me full in the chest and hurled me, half stunned and wholly winded,  clear across the broad highway and into the underbrush of the jungle  that fringes it.    Fortunately, I passed between the boles of trees; had I struck one  of them I should have been badly injured, if not killed, so swiftly  had I been catapulted by that enormous hind leg.    Dazed though I was, I stumbled to my feet and staggered back to  Woola's assistance, to find his savage antagonist circling ten feet  above the ground, beating madly at the clinging calot with all six  powerful legs.    Even during my sudden flight through the air I had not once released  my grip upon my long-sword, and now I ran beneath the two battling  monsters, jabbing the winged terror repeatedly with its sharp point.    The thing might easily have risen out of my reach, but evidently it  knew as little concerning retreat in the face of danger as either  Woola or I, for it dropped quickly toward me, and before I could  escape had grasped my shoulder between its powerful jaws.    Time and again the now useless stub of its giant sting struck futilely  against my body, but the blows alone were almost as effective as  the kick of a horse; so that when I say futilely, I refer only to  the natural function of the disabled member--eventually the thing  would have hammered me to a pulp.  Nor was it far from accomplishing  this when an interruption occurred that put an end forever to its  hostilities.    From where I hung a few feet above the road I could see along the  highway a few hundred yards to where it turned toward the east,  and just as I had about given up all hope of escaping the perilous  position in which I now was I saw a red warrior come into view from  around the bend.    He was mounted on a splendid thoat, one of the smaller species used  by red men, and in his hand was a wondrous long, light lance.    His mount was walking sedately when I first perceived them, but the  instant that the red man's eyes fell upon us a word to the thoat  brought the animal at full charge down upon us.  The long lance  of the warrior dipped toward us, and as thoat and rider hurtled  beneath, the point passed through the body of our antagonist.    With a convulsive shudder the thing stiffened, the jaws relaxed,  dropping me to the ground, and then, careening once in mid air,  the creature plunged headforemost to the road, full upon Woola,  who still clung tenaciously to its gory head.    By the time I had regained my feet the red man had turned and ridden  back to us.  Woola, finding his enemy inert and lifeless, released  his hold at my command and wriggled from beneath the body that had  covered him, and together we faced the warrior looking down upon  us.    I started to thank the stranger for his timely assistance, but he  cut me off peremptorily.    \"Who are you,\" he asked, \"who dare enter the land of Kaol and hunt  in the royal forest of the jeddak?\"    Then, as he noted my white skin through the coating of grime and  blood that covered me, his eyes went wide and in an altered tone  he whispered:  \"Can it be that you are a Holy Thern?\"    I might have deceived the fellow for a time, as I had deceived  others, but I had cast away the yellow wig and the holy diadem in  the presence of Matai Shang, and I knew that it would not be long  ere my new acquaintance discovered that I was no thern at all.    \"I am not a thern,\" I replied, and then, flinging caution to the  winds, I said:  \"I am John Carter, Prince of Helium, whose name  may not be entirely unknown to you.\"    If his eyes had gone wide when he thought that I was a Holy Thern,  they fairly popped now that he knew that I was John Carter.  I  grasped my long-sword more firmly as I spoke the words which I was  sure would precipitate an attack, but to my surprise they precipitated  nothing of the kind.    \"John Carter, Prince of Helium,\" he repeated slowly, as though he  could not quite grasp the truth of the statement.  \"John Carter,  the mightiest warrior of Barsoom!\"    And then he dismounted and placed his hand upon my shoulder after  the manner of most friendly greeting upon Mars.    \"It is my duty, and it should be my pleasure, to kill you, John  Carter,\" he said, \"but always in my heart of hearts have I admired  your prowess and believed in your sincerity the while I have  questioned and disbelieved the therns and their religion.    \"It would mean my instant death were my heresy to be suspected in  the court of Kulan Tith, but if I may serve you, Prince, you have  but to command Torkar Bar, Dwar of the Kaolian Road.\"    Truth and honesty were writ large upon the warrior's noble countenance,  so that I could not but have trusted him, enemy though he should  have been.  His title of Captain of the Kaolian Road explained  his timely presence in the heart of the savage forest, for every  highway upon Barsoom is patrolled by doughty warriors of the noble  class, nor is there any service more honorable than this lonely  and dangerous duty in the less frequented sections of the domains  of the red men of Barsoom.    \"Torkar Bar has already placed a great debt of gratitude upon my  shoulders,\" I replied, pointing to the carcass of the creature from  whose heart he was dragging his long spear.    The red man smiled.    \"It was fortunate that I came when I did,\" he said.  \"Only this  poisoned spear pricking the very heart of a sith can kill it quickly  enough to save its prey.  In this section of Kaol we are all armed  with a long sith spear, whose point is smeared with the poison of  the creature it is intended to kill; no other virus acts so quickly  upon the beast as its own.    \"Look,\" he continued, drawing his dagger and making an incision  in the carcass a foot above the root of the sting, from which he  presently drew forth two sacs, each of which held fully a gallon  of the deadly liquid.    \"Thus we maintain our supply, though were it not for certain commercial  uses to which the virus is put, it would scarcely be necessary to  add to our present store, since the sith is almost extinct.    \"Only occasionally do we now run upon one.  Of old, however, Kaol  was overrun with the frightful monsters that often came in herds  of twenty or thirty, darting down from above into our cities and  carrying away women, children, and even warriors.\"    As he spoke I had been wondering just how much I might safely tell  this man of the mission which brought me to his land, but his next  words anticipated the broaching of the subject on my part, and  rendered me thankful that I had not spoken too soon.    \"And now as to yourself, John Carter,\" he said, \"I shall not ask  your business here, nor do I wish to hear it.  I have eyes and ears  and ordinary intelligence, and yesterday morning I saw the party  that came to the city of Kaol from the north in a small flier.  But  one thing I ask of you, and that is: the word of John Carter that  he contemplates no overt act against either the nation of Kaol or  its jeddak.\"    \"You may have my word as to that, Torkar Bar,\" I replied.    \"My way leads along the Kaolian road, away from the city of Kaol,\"  he continued.  \"I have seen no one--John Carter least of all.  Nor  have you seen Torkar Bar, nor ever heard of him.  You understand?\"    \"Perfectly,\" I replied.    He laid his hand upon my shoulder.    \"This road leads directly into the city of Kaol,\" he said.  \"I wish  you fortune,\" and vaulting to the back of his thoat he trotted away  without even a backward glance.    It was after dark when Woola and I spied through the mighty forest  the great wall which surrounds the city of Kaol.    We had traversed the entire way without mishap or adventure, and  though the few we had met had eyed the great calot wonderingly,  none had pierced the red pigment with which I had smoothly smeared  every square inch of my body.    But to traverse the surrounding country, and to enter the guarded  city of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, were two very different things.  No man enters a Martian city without giving a very detailed and  satisfactory account of himself, nor did I delude myself with the  belief that I could for a moment impose upon the acumen of the  officers of the guard to whom I should be taken the moment I applied  at any one of the gates.    My only hope seemed to lie in entering the city surreptitiously  under cover of the darkness, and once in, trust to my own wits to  hide myself in some crowded quarter where detection would be less  liable to occur.    With this idea in view I circled the great wall, keeping within the  fringe of the forest, which is cut away"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6812"],[0,"Abraham Lincoln: a History — Volume 01 (#11)"],[1,"onsidering, however, the few  inhabitants of the south and the center were principally from what  came afterwards to be called the border slave States. They were mostly  a simple, neighborly, unambitious people, contented with their  condition, living upon plain fare, and knowing not much of anything  better. Luxury was, of course, unknown; even wealth, if it existed,  could procure few of the comforts of refined life. There was little or  no money in circulation. Exchanges were effected by the most primitive  forms of barter, and each family had to rely chiefly upon itself for  the means of living. The neighbors would lend a hand in building a  cabin for a new-comer; after that he must in most cases shift for  himself. Many a man arriving from an old community, and imperfectly  appreciating the necessities of pioneer life, has found suddenly, on  the approach of winter, that he must learn to make shoes or go  barefoot. The furniture of their houses was made with an axe from the  trees of the forest. Their clothing was all made at home. The buckskin  days were over to a great extent, though an occasional hunting-shirt  and pair of moccasins were still seen. But flax and hemp had begun to  be cultivated, and as the wolves were killed off the sheep-folds  increased, and garments resembling those of civilization were spun and  woven, and cut and sewed, by the women of the family. When a man had a  suit of jeans colored with butternut-dye, and his wife a dress of  linsey, they could appear with the best at a wedding or a quilting  frolic. The superfluous could not have been said to exist in a  community where men made their own buttons, where women dug roots in  the woods to make their tea with, where many children never saw a  stick of candy until after they were grown. The only sweetmeats known  were those a skillful cook could compose from the honey plundered from  the hollow oaks where the wild bees had stored it. Yet there was  withal a kind of rude plenty; the woods swarmed with game, and after  swine began to be raised, there was the bacon and hoe-cake which any  south-western farmer will say is good enough for a king. The greatest  privation was the lack of steel implements. His axe was as precious to  the pioneer as his sword to the knight errant. Governor John Reynolds  speaks of the panic felt in his father's family when the axe was  dropped into a stream. A battered piece of tin was carefully saved and  smoothed, and made into a grater for green corn.    [Sidenote: William H. Herndon's speech at Old Settlers' Meeting,  Menard County.]    [Sidenote: \"Old Times in McLean County,\" p. 194.]    They had their own amusements, of course; no form of society is  without them, from the anthropoid apes to the Jockey Club. As to the  grosser and ruder shapes taken by the diversions of the pioneers, we  will let Mr. Herndon speak--their contemporary annalist and ardent  panegyrist: \"These men could shave a horse's mane and tail, paint,  disfigure, and offer it for sale to the owner. They could hoop up in a  hogshead a drunken man, they themselves being drunk, put in and nail  fast the head, and roll the man down hill a hundred feet or more. They  could run down a lean and hungry wild pig, catch it, heat a ten-plate  stove furnace hot, and putting in the pig, could cook it, they dancing  the while a merry jig.\" Wild oats of this kind seem hardly compatible  with a harvest of civilization, but it is contended that such of these  roysterers as survived their stormy beginnings became decent and  serious citizens. Indeed, Mr. Herndon insists than even in their hot  youth they showed the promise of goodness and piety. \"They attended  church, heard the sermon, wept and prayed, shouted, got up and fought  an hour, and then went back to prayer, just as the spirit moved them.\"  The camp-meeting may be said, with no irreverent intention, to have  been their principal means of intellectual excitement. The circuit  preachers were for a long time the only circulating medium of thought  and emotion that kept the isolated settlements from utter spiritual  stagnation. They were men of great physical and moral endurance,  absolutely devoted to their work, which they pursued in the face of  every hardship and discouragement. Their circuits were frequently so  great in extent that they were forced to be constantly on the route;  what reading they did was done in the saddle. They received perhaps  fifty dollars from the missionary fund and half as much more from  their congregations, paid for the most part in necessaries of life.  Their oratory was suited to their longitude, and was principally  addressed to the emotions of their hearers. It was often very  effective, producing shouts and groans and genuflections among the  audience at large, and terrible convulsions among the more nervous and  excitable. We hear sometimes of a whole congregation prostrated as by  a hurricane, flinging their limbs about in furious contortions, with  wild outcries. To this day some of the survivors of that period insist  that it was the spirit of the Almighty, and nothing less, that thus  manifested itself. The minister, however, did not always share in the  delirium of his hearers. Governor Reynolds tells us of a preacher in  Sangamon County, who, before his sermon, had set a wolf-trap in view  from his pulpit. In the midst of his exhortations his keen eyes saw  the distant trap collapse, and he continued in the same intonation  with which he had been preaching, \"Mind the text, brethren, till I go  kill that wolf!\" With all the failings and eccentricities of this  singular class of men, they did a great deal of good, and are entitled  to especial credit among those who conquered the wilderness. The  emotions they excited did not all die away in the shouts and  contortions of the meeting. Not a few of the cabins in the clearings  were the abode of a fervent religion and an austere morality. Many a  traveler, approaching a rude hut in the woods in the gathering  twilight, distrusting the gaunt and silent family who gave him an  unsmiling welcome, the bare interior, the rifles and knives  conspicuously displayed, has felt his fears vanish when he sat down to  supper, and the master of the house, in a few fervent words, invoked  the blessing of heaven on the meal.    There was very little social intercourse; a visit was a serious  matter, involving the expenditure of days of travel. It was the custom  among families, when the longing for the sight of kindred faces was  too strong to withstand, to move in a body to the distant settlement  where their relatives lived and remain with them for months at a time.  The claims of consanguinity were more regarded than now. Almost the  only festivities were those that accompanied weddings, and these were,  of course, of a primitive kind. The perils and adventures through  which the young pioneers went to obtain their brides furnish forth  thousands of tales by Western firesides. Instead of taking the rosy  daughter of a neighbor, the enterprising bachelor would often go back  to Kentucky, and pass through as many adventures in bringing his wife  home as a returning crusader would meet between Beirut and Vienna. If  she was a young woman who respected herself, the household gear she  would insist on bringing would entail an Iliad of embarrassments. An  old farmer of Sangamon County still talks of a featherbed weighing  fifty-four pounds with which his wife made him swim six rivers under  penalty of desertion.    It was not always easy to find a competent authority to perform the  ceremony. A justice in McLean County lived by the bank of a river, and  his services were sometimes required by impatient lovers on the other  bank when the waters were too torrential to cross. In such cases,  being a conscientious man, he always insisted that they should ride  into the stream far enough for him to discern their features, holding  torches to their faces by night and by storm. The wooing of those days  was prompt and practical. There was no time for the gradual approaches  of an idler and more conventional age. It is related of one Stout, one  of the legendary Nimrods of Illinois, who was well and frequently  married, that he had one unfailing formula of courtship. He always  promised the ladies whose hearts he was besieging that \"they should  live in the timber where they could pick up their own firewood.\"    Theft was almost unknown; property, being so hard to get, was  jealously guarded, as we have already noticed in speaking of the  settlement of Kentucky. The pioneers of Illinois brought with them the  same rigid notions of honesty which their environment maintained. A  man in Macoupin County left his wagon, loaded with corn, stuck in the  prairie mud for two weeks near a frequented road. When he returned he  found some of his corn gone, but there was money enough tied in the  sacks to pay for what was taken. Men carrying bags of silver from the  towns of Illinois to St. Louis rather made a display of it, as it  enhanced their own importance, and there was no fear of robbery. There  were of course no locks on the cabin doors, and the early merchants  sometimes left their stores unprotected for days together when they  went to the nearest city to replenish their stock. Of course there  were rare exceptions to this rule, but a single theft alarmed and  excited a whole neighborhood. When a crime was traced home, the family  of the criminal were generally obliged to remove.    [Sidenote: N.W. Edwards, \"Life and Times of Ninian Edwards,\" p. 163.]    There were still, even so late as the time to which we are referring,  two alien elements in the population of the State--the French and the  Indians. The French settlements about Kaskaskia retained much of their  national character, and the pioneers from the South who visited them  or settled among them never ceased to wonder at their gayety, their  peaceable industry and"]]]
