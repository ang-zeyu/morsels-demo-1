A good, short account of the Italian  movement is given by A. Lanzillo, ``Le Mouvement Ouvrier en  Italie,'' Bibliotheque du Mouvement Proletarien. See also Paul  Louis, ``Le Syndicalisme Europeen,'' chap. vi. On the other  hand Cole (``World of Labour,'' chap. vi) considers the strength  of genuine Syndicalism in Italy to be small.    [21] This is often recognized by Syndicalists themselves. See,  e.g., an article on ``The Old International'' in the Syndicalist  of February, 1913, which, after giving an account of the struggle  between Marx and Bakunin from the standpoint of a sympathizer  with the latter, says: ``Bakounin's ideas are now more alive  than ever.''    [22] See pp. 42-43, and 160 of ``Syndicalism in France,'' Louis  Levine, Ph.D. (Columbia University Studies in Political Science,  vol. xlvi, No. 3.) This is a very objective and reliable account  of the origin and progress of French Syndicalism. An admirable  short discussion of its ideas and its present position will be  found in Cole's ``World of Labour'' (G. Bell & Sons), especially  chapters iii, iv, and xi.      The war of 1870 put an end for the time being  to the Socialist Movement in France. Its revival  was begun by Jules Guesde in 1877. Unlike the Ger-  man Socialists, the French have been split into many  different factions. In the early eighties there was a  split between the Parliamentary Socialists and the  Communist Anarchists. The latter thought that the  first act of the Social Revolution should be the  destruction of the State, and would therefore have  nothing to do with Parliamentary politics. The  Anarchists, from 1883 onward, had success in Paris  and the South. The Socialists contended that the  State will disappear after the Socialist society has  been firmly established. In 1882 the Socialists split  between the followers of Guesde, who claimed to represent  the revolutionary and scientific Socialism of  Marx, and the followers of Paul Brousse, who were  more opportunist and were also called possibilists  and cared little for the theories of Marx. In 1890  there was a secession from the Broussists, who followed  Allemane and absorbed the more revolutionary  elements of the party and became leading spirits in  some of the strongest syndicates. Another group  was the Independent Socialists, among whom were  Jaures, Millerand and Viviani.[23]      [23] See Levine, op. cit., chap. ii.      The disputes between the various sections of  Socialists caused difficulties in the Trade Unions and  helped to bring about the resolution to keep politics  out of the Unions. From this to Syndicalism was  an easy step.    Since the year 1905, as the result of a union  between the Parti Socialiste de France (Part; Ouvrier  Socialiste Revolutionnaire Francais led by  Guesde) and the Parti Socialiste Francais (Jaures),  there have been only two groups of Socialists, the  United Socialist Party and the Independents, who  are intellectuals or not willing to be tied to a party.  At the General Election of 1914 the former secured  102 members and the latter 30, out of a total of 590.    Tendencies toward a rapprochement between the  various groups were seriously interfered with by an  event which had considerable importance for the  whole development of advanced political ideas in  France, namely, the acceptance of office in the Waldeck-  Rousseau Ministry by the Socialist Millerand  in 1899. Millerand, as was to be expected, soon  ceased to be a Socialist, and the opponents of political  action pointed to his development as showing  the vanity of political triumphs. Very many French  politicians who have risen to power have begun their  political career as Socialists, and have ended it not  infrequently by employing the army to oppress  strikers. Millerand's action was the most notable  and dramatic among a number of others of a similar  kind. Their cumulative effect has been to produce a  certain cynicism in regard to politics among the more  class-conscious of French wage-earners, and this  state of mind greatly assisted the spread of Syndicalism.    Syndicalism stands essentially for the point of  view of the producer as opposed to that of the consumer;  it is concerned with reforming actual work,  and the organization of industry, not MERELY with  securing greater rewards for work. From this point  of view its vigor and its distinctive character are  derived. It aims at substituting industrial for political  action, and at using Trade Union organization  for purposes for which orthodox Socialism would  look to Parliament. ``Syndicalism'' was originally  only the French name for Trade Unionism, but the  Trade Unionists of France became divided into two  sections, the Reformist and the Revolutionary, of  whom the latter only professed the ideas which we  now associate with the term ``Syndicalism.'' It is  quite impossible to guess how far either the organization  or the ideas of the Syndicalists will remain intact  at the end of the war, and everything that we shall say  is to be taken as applying only to the years before  the war. It may be that French Syndicalism as a  distinctive movement will be dead, but even in that  case it will not have lost its importance, since it has  given a new impulse and direction to the more vigorous  part of the labor movement in all civilized countries,  with the possible exception of Germany.    The organization upon which Syndicalism de-  pended was the Confederation Generale du Travail,  commonly known as the C. G. T., which was founded  in 1895, but only achieved its final form in 1902. It  has never been numerically very powerful, but has  derived its influence from the fact that in moments  of crisis many who were not members were willing  to follow its guidance. Its membership in the year  before the war is estimated by Mr. Cole at somewhat  more than half a million. Trade Unions (Syndicats)  were legalized by Waldeck-Rousseau in 1884,  and the C. G. T., on its inauguration in 1895, was  formed by the Federation of 700 Syndicats. Alongside  of this organization there existed another, the  Federation des Bourses du Travail, formed in 1893.  A Bourse du Travail is a local organization, not of  any one trade, but of local labor in general, intended  to serve as a Labor Exchange and to perform such  functions for labor as Chambers of Commerce perform  for the employer.[24] A Syndicat is in general  a local organization of a single industry, and is thus  a smaller unit than the Bourse du Travail.[25] Under  the able leadership of Pelloutier, the Federation des  Bourses prospered more than the C. G. T., and at  last, in 1902, coalesced with it. The result was an  organization in which the local Syndicat was fed-  erated twice over, once with the other Syndicat in  its locality, forming together the local Bourse du  Travail, and again with the Syndicats in the same  industry in other places. ``It was the purpose of the  new organization to secure twice over the membership  of every syndicat, to get it to join both its local  Bourse du Travail and the Federation of its industry.  The Statutes of the C. G. T. (I. 3) put this point  plainly: `No Syndicat will be able to form a part of  the C. G. T. if it is not federated nationally and an  adherent of a Bourse du Travail or a local or departmental  Union of Syndicats grouping different associations.'  Thus, M. Lagardelle explains, the two sections  will correct each other's point of view: national  federation of industries will prevent parochialism  (localisme), and local organization will check the  corporate or `Trade Union' spirit. The workers will  learn at once the solidarity of all workers in a locality  and that of all workers in a trade, and, in learning  this, they will learn at the same time the complete  solidarity of the whole working-class.''[26]      [24] Cole, ib., p. 65.    [25] ``Syndicat in France still means a local union--there are  at the present day only four national syndicats'' (ib., p. 66).    [26] Cole, ib. p. 69.      This organization was largely the work of Pellouties,  who was Secretary of the Federation des Bourses  from 1894 until his death in 1901. He was an Anarchist  Communist and impressed his ideas upon the  Federation and thence posthumously on the C. G. T.  after its combination with the Federation des  Bourses. He even carried his principles into the  government of the Federation; the Committee had  no chairman and votes very rarely took place. He  stated that ``the task of the revolution is to free  mankind, not only from all authority, but also from  every institution which has not for its essential purpose  the development of production.''    The C. G. T. allows much autonomy to each unit  in the organization. Each Syndicat counts for one,  whether it be large or small. There are not the  friendly society activities which form so large a part  of the work of English Unions. It gives no orders,  but is purely advisory. It does not allow politics  to be introduced into the Unions. This decision was  originally based upon the fact that the divisions  among Socialists disrupted the Unions, but it is now  reinforced in the minds of an important section by  the general Anarchist dislike of politics. The C. G.  T. is essentially a fighting organization; in strikes, it  is the nucleus to which the other workers rally.    There is a Reformist section in the C. G. T., but  it is practically always in a minority, and the C. G.  T. is, to all intents and purposes, the organ of  revolutionary Syndicalism, which is simply the creed  of its leaders.    The essential doctrine of Syndicalism is the class-  war, to be conducted by industrial rather than politi-  cal methods. The chief industrial methods advocated  are the strike, the boycott, the label and sabotage.

But  you're improving all the time.\"    \"But I can't gallop yet,\" said Sheen.    \"Well, no, not gallop exactly, but you've only had six lessons. Why, in  another six weeks, if you come regular, you won't know yourself. You'll  be making some of the young gentlemen at the college wish they had  never been born. You'll make babies of them, that's what you'll do.\"    \"I'll bet I couldn't, if I'd learnt with some one else,\" said Sheen,  sincerely. \"I don't believe I should have learnt a thing if I'd gone to  the school instructor.\"    \"Who is your school instructor, sir?\"    \"A man named Jenkins. He used to be in the army.\"    \"Well, there, you see, that's what it is. I know old George Jenkins. He  used to be a pretty good boxer in his time, but there! boxing's a  thing, like everything else, that moves with the times. We used to go  about in iron trucks. Now we go in motor-cars. Just the same with  boxing. What you're learning now is the sort of boxing that wins  championship fights nowadays. Old George, well, he teaches you how to  put your left out, but, my Golly, he doesn't know any tricks. He hasn't  studied it same as I have. It's the ring-craft that wins battles. Now  sir, if you're ready.\"    They put on the gloves again. When the round was over, Mr Bevan had  further comments to make.    \"You don't hit hard enough, sir,\" he said. \"Don't flap. Let it come  straight out with some weight behind it. You want to be earnest in the  ring. The other man's going to do his best to hurt you, and you've got  to stop him. One good punch is worth twenty taps. You hit him. And when  you've hit him, don't you go back; you hit him again. They'll only give  you three rounds in any competition you go in for, so you want to do  the work you can while you're at it.\"    As the days went by, Sheen began to imbibe some of Joe Bevan's rugged  philosophy of life. He began to understand that the world is a place  where every man has to look after himself, and that it is the stronger  hand that wins. That sentence from _Hamlet_ which Joe Bevan was so  fond of quoting practically summed up the whole duty of man--and boy  too. One should not seek quarrels, but, \"being in,\" one should do one's  best to ensure that one's opponent thought twice in future before  seeking them. These afternoons at the \"Blue Boar\" were gradually giving  Sheen what he had never before possessed--self-confidence. He was  beginning to find that he was capable of something after all, that in  an emergency he would be able to keep his end up. The feeling added a  zest to all that he did. His work in school improved. He looked at the  Gotford no longer as a prize which he would have to struggle to win. He  felt that his rivals would have to struggle to win it from him.    After his twelfth lesson, when he had learned the ground-work of the  art, and had begun to develop a style of his own, like some nervous  batsman at cricket who does not show his true form till he has been at  the wickets for several overs, the dog-loving Francis gave him a trial.  This was a very different affair from his spars with Joe Bevan. Frank  Hunt was one of the cleverest boxers at his weight in England, but he  had not Joe Bevan's gift of hitting gently. He probably imagined that  he was merely tapping, and certainly his blows were not to be compared  with those he delivered in the exercise of his professional duties;  but, nevertheless, Sheen had never felt anything so painful before, not  even in his passage of arms with Albert. He came out of the encounter  with a swollen lip and a feeling that one of his ribs was broken, and  he had not had the pleasure of landing a single blow upon his slippery  antagonist, who flowed about the room like quicksilver. But he had not  flinched, and the statement of Francis, as they shook hands, that he  had \"done varry well,\" was as balm. Boxing is one of the few sports  where the loser can feel the same thrill of triumph as the winner.  There is no satisfaction equal to that which comes when one has forced  oneself to go through an ordeal from which one would have liked to have  escaped.    \"Capital, sir, capital,\" said Joe Bevan. \"I wanted to see whether you  would lay down or not when you began to get a few punches. You did  capitally, Mr Sheen.\"    \"I didn't hit him much,\" said Sheen with a laugh.    \"Never mind, sir, you got hit, which was just as good. Some of the  gentlemen I've taught wouldn't have taken half that. They're all right  when they're on top and winning, and to see them shape you'd say to  yourself, By George, here's a champion. But let 'em get a punch or two,  and hullo! says you, what's this? They don't like it. They lay down.  But you kept on. There's one thing, though, you want to keep that guard  up when you duck. You slip him that way once. Very well. Next time he's  waiting for you. He doesn't hit straight. He hooks you, and you don't  want many of those.\"    Sheen enjoyed his surreptitious visits to the \"Blue Boar.\" Twice he  escaped being caught in the most sensational way; and once Mr Spence,  who looked after the Wrykyn cricket and gymnasium, and played  everything equally well, nearly caused complications by inviting Sheen  to play fives with him after school. Fortunately the Gotford afforded  an excellent excuse. As the time for the examination drew near, those  who had entered for it were accustomed to become hermits to a great  extent, and to retire after school to work in their studies.    \"You mustn't overdo it, Sheen,\" said Mr Spence. \"You ought to get some  exercise.\"    \"Oh, I do, sir,\" said Sheen. \"I still play fives, but I play before  breakfast now.\"    He had had one or two games with Harrington of the School House, who  did not care particularly whom he played with so long as his opponent  was a useful man. Sheen being one of the few players in the school who  were up to his form, Harrington ignored the cloud under which Sheen  rested. When they met in the world outside the fives-courts Harrington  was polite, but made no overtures of friendship. That, it may be  mentioned, was the attitude of every one who did not actually cut  Sheen. The exception was Jack Bruce, who had constituted himself  audience to Sheen, when the latter was practising the piano, on two  further occasions. But then Bruce was so silent by nature that for all  practical purposes he might just as well have cut Sheen like the  others.    \"We might have a game before breakfast some time, then,\" said Mr  Spence.    He had noticed, being a master who did notice things, that Sheen  appeared to have few friends, and had made up his mind that he would  try and bring him out a little. Of the real facts of the case, he knew  of course, nothing.    \"I should like to, sir,\" said Sheen.    \"Next Wednesday?\"    \"All right, sir.\"    \"I'll be there at seven. If you're before me, you might get the second  court, will you?\"    The second court from the end nearest the boarding-house was the best  of the half-dozen fives-courts at Wrykyn. After school sometimes you  would see fags racing across the gravel to appropriate it for their  masters. The rule was that whoever first pinned to the door a piece of  paper with his name on it was the legal owner of the court--and it was a  stirring sight to see a dozen fags fighting to get at the door. But  before breakfast the court might be had with less trouble.           *       *       *       *       *    Meanwhile, Sheen paid his daily visits to the \"Blue Boar,\" losing flesh  and gaining toughness with every lesson. The more he saw of Joe Bevan  the more he liked him, and appreciated his strong, simple outlook on  life. Shakespeare was a great bond between them. Sheen had always been  a student of the Bard, and he and Joe would sit on the little verandah  of the inn, looking over the river, until it was time for him to row  back to the town, quoting passages at one another. Joe Bevan's  knowledge, of the plays, especially the tragedies, was wide, and at  first inexplicable to Sheen. It was strange to hear him declaiming long  speeches from _Macbeth_ or _Hamlet_, and to think that he was  by profession a pugilist. One evening he explained his curious  erudition. In his youth, before he took to the ring in earnest, he had  travelled with a Shakespearean repertory company. \"I never played a  star part,\" he confessed, \"but I used to come on in the Battle of  Bosworth and in Macbeth's castle and what not. I've been First Citizen  sometimes. I was the carpenter in _Julius Caesar_. That was my  biggest part. 'Truly sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as  you would say, a cobbler.' But somehow the stage--well..._you_  know what it is, sir. Leeds one week, Manchester the next, Brighton the  week after, and travelling all Sunday. It wasn't quiet enough for me.\"    The idea of becoming a professional pugilist for the sake of peace and  quiet tickled Sheen. \"But I've always read Shakespeare ever since  then,\" continued Mr Bevan, \"and I always shall read him.\"    It was on the next day that Mr Bevan made a suggestion which drew  confidences from Sheen, in his turn.    \"What you want now, sir,\" he said, \"is to practise on someone of about  your own form, as the saying is. Isn't there some gentleman friend of  yours at the college who would come here with you?\"    They were sitting on the verandah when he asked this question. It was  growing dusk, and the evening seemed to invite confidences. Sheen,  looking out across the river and avoiding his friend's glance,  explained just what it was that made it so difficult for him to produce  a gentleman friend at that particular time. He could feel Mr Bevan's  eye upon him, but he went through with it till the thing was  told--boldly, and with no attempt to smooth over any of the unpleasant  points.    \"Never you mind, sir,\" said Mr Bevan consolingly, as he finished. \"We  all lose our heads sometimes."]]]
