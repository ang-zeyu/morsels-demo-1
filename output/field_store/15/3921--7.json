Od. xvii. 10, 12.]         What longs it to the seaven stars, and me,       Or those about Bootes be.    Anaximenes writing to Pythagoras, saith, \"With what sense can I  amuse my selfe in the secrets of the Starres, having continually  death or bondage before mine eyes?\" For at that time the Kings of  Persia were making preparations to war against his Countrie. All men  ought to say so: Being beaten with ambition, with avarice, with  rashnesse, and with superstition, and having such other enemies unto  life within him. Wherefore shall I study and take care about the  mobility and variation of the world? When hee is once taught what is  fit to make him better and wiser, he shall be entertained with  Logicke, naturall Philosophy, Geometry, and Rhetoricke, then having  setled his judgement, looke what science he doth most addict  himselfe unto, he shall in short time attaine to the perfection of  it. His lecture shall be somtimes by way of talke and sometimes by  booke: his tutor may now and then supply him with the same Author,  as an end and motive of his institution: sometimes giving him the  pith and substance of it ready chewed. And if of himselfe he be not  so throughly acquainted with bookes, that hee may readily find so  many notable discourses as are in them to effect his purpose, it  shall not be amisse that some learned man bee appointed to keepe  him, company, who at any time of need may furnish him with such  munition as hee shall stand in need of; that hee may afterward  distribute and dispense them to his best use. And that this kind of  lesson be more easie and naturall than that of Gaza, who will make  question? Those are but harsh, thornie, and unpleasant precepts;  vaine, idle and immaterial words, on which small hold may be taken;  wherein is nothing to quicken the minde. In this the spirit findeth  substance to bide and feed upon. A fruit without all comparison much  better, and that will soone be ripe. It is a thing worthy  consideration, to see what state things are brought unto in this our  age; and how Philosophie, even to the wisest, and men of best  understanding, is but an idle, vaine and fantasticall name, of small  use and lesse worth, both in opinion and effect. I thinke these  Sophistries are the cause of it, which have forestalled the wayes to  come unto it: They doe very ill that goe about to make it seeme as  it were inaccessible for children to come unto, setting it foorth  with a wrimpled [Footnote: wrinkled.] gastlie, and frowning visage;  who hath masked her with so counterfet, pale, and hideous a  countenance? There is nothing more beauteous, nothing more  delightful, nothing more gamesome; and as I may say, nothing more  fondly wanton: for she presenteth nothing to our eyes, and preacheth  nothing to our eares, but sport and pastime. A sad and lowring looke  plainly declareth that that is not her haunt. Demetrius the  Gramarian, finding a companie of Philosophers sitting close together  in the Temple of Delphos, said unto them, \"Either I am deceived, or  by your plausible and pleasant lookes, you are not in any serious  and earnest discourse amongst your selves;\" to whom one of them,  named Heracleon the Megarian, answered, \"That belongeth to them, who  busie themselves in seeking whether the future tense of the verbe  ___, hath a double, or that labour to find the derivation of the  comparatives, [omitted] and of the superlatives [omitted], it is  they that must chafe in intertaining themselves with their science:  as for discourses of Philosophie they are wont to glad, rejoyce, and  not to vex and molest those that use them.\"         Deprendas animi tormenta latentis in agro       Corpore, deprendas et gaudia; sumit utrumque       Inde habitum facies.       [Footnote: Juven, SAT. ix, 18]         You may perceive the torments of the mind,       Hid in sicke bodie, you the joyes may find;       The face such habit takes in either kind.    That mind which harboureth Philosophie, ought by reason of her sound  health, make that bodie also sound and healthie: it ought to make  her contentment to through-shine in all exteriour parts: it ought to  shapen and modell all outward demeanours to the modell of it: and by  consequence arme him that doth possesse it, with a gracious  stoutnesse and lively audacite, with an active and pleasing gesture,  and with a setled and cheerefull countenance. The most evident token  and apparant signe of true wisdome is a constant and unconstrained  rejoycing, whose estate is like unto all things above the Moone,  that is ever cleare, alwaies bright. It is Baroco [Footnote:  Mnemonic words invented by the scholastic logicians] and Baralipton  [Footnote: Mnemonic words invented by the scholastic logicians],  that makes their followers prove so base and idle, and not  Philosophie; they know her not but by heare-say; what? Is it not  shee that cleereth all stormes of the mind? And teacheth miserie,  famine, and sicknesse to laugh? Not by reason of some imaginarie  Epicicles [Footnote: A term of the old astronomy.], but by naturall  and palpable reasons. Shee aymeth at nothing but vertue; it is  vertue shee seekes after; which as the schoole saith, is not pitcht  on the top of an high, steepie, or inaccessible hill; for they that  have come unto her, affirme that cleane-contrarie shee keeps her  stand, and holds her mansion in a faire, flourishing, and pleasant  plaine, whence as from an high watch tower, she survaieth all  things, to be subject unto her, to whom any man may with great  facilitie come, if he but know the way or entrance to her palace:  for, the pathes that lead unto her are certaine fresh and shadie  greene allies, sweet and flowrie waies, whose ascent is even, easie,  and nothing wearisome, like unto that of heavens vaults. Forsomuch  as they have not frequented this vertue, who gloriously, as in a  throne of Majestie sits soveraigne, goodly, triumphant, lovely,  equally delicious, and couragious, protesting her selfe to be a  professed and irreconcileable enemie to all sharpnesse, austeritie,  feare, and compulsion; having nature for her guide, fortune and  voluptuousnesse for her companions; they according to their  weaknesse have imaginarily fained her, to have a foolish, sad, grim,  quarelous, spitefull, threatning, and disdainfull visage, with an  horride and unpleasant looke; and have placed her upon a craggie,  sharpe, and unfrequented rocke, amidst desert cliffes and uncouth  crags, as a scar-crow, or bugbeare, to affright the common people  with. Now the tutour, which ought to know that he should rather seek  to fill the mind and store the will of his disciple, as much, or  rather more, with love and affection, than with awe, and reverence  unto vertue, may shew and tell him, that Poets follow common  humours, making him plainly to perceive, and as it were palpably to  feele, that the Gods have rather placed labour and sweat at the  entrances which lead to Venus chambers, than at the doores that  direct to Pallas cabinets.    And when he shall perceive his scholler to have a sensible feeling  of himselfe, presenting Bradamant [Footnote: A warlike heroine in  Boiardo's \"Orlando Innamorato\" and Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso.\"] or  Angelica [Footnote: The faithless princess, on account of whom  Orlando goes mad, in the same poems.] before him, as a Mistresse to  enjoy, embelished with a naturall, active, generous, and unspotted  beautie not uglie or Giant-like, but blithe and livelie, in respect  of a wanton, soft, affected, and artificiall-flaring beautie; the  one attired like unto a young man, coyfed with a bright-shining  helmet, the other disguised and drest about the head like unto an  impudent harlot, with embroyderies, frizelings, and carcanets of  pearles: he will no doubt deeme his owne love to be a man and no  woman, if in his choice he differ from that effeminate shepheard of  Phrygia. In this new kind of lesson he shall declare unto him, that  the prize, the glorie, and height of true vertue, consisted in the  facilitie, profit, and pleasure of his exercises: so far from  difficultie and incumbrances, that children as well as men, the  simple as soone as the wise, may come unto her. Discretion and  temperance, not force or way-wardnesse are the instruments to bring  him unto her. Socrates (vertues chiefe favorite) that he might the  better walke in the pleasant, naturall, and open path of her  progresses, doth voluntarily and in good, earnest, quit all  compulsion. Shee is the nurse and foster-mother of all humane  [Footnote: Human.] pleasures, who in making them just and upright,  she also makes them sure and sincere. By moderating them, she  keepeth them in ure [Footnote: Practice.] and breath. In limiting  and cutting them off, whom she refuseth; she whets us on toward  those she leaveth unto us; and plenteously leaves us them, which  Nature pleaseth, and like a kind mother giveth us over unto  satietie, if not unto wearisomnesse, unlesse we will peradventure  say that the rule and bridle, which stayeth the drunkard before  drunkennesse, the glutton before surfetting, and the letcher before  the losing of his haire, be the enemies of our pleasures. If common  fortune faile her, it cleerely scapes her; or she cares not for her,  or she frames another unto herselfe, altogether her owne, not so  fleeting nor so rowling. She knoweth the way how to be rich, mightie  and wise, and how to lie in sweet-perfumed beds. She loveth life;  she delights in beautie, in glorie, and in health. But her proper  and particular office is, first to know how to use such goods  temperately, and how to lose them constantly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],[0,"The Lectures on Faith (#11)"],[1,"he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he  made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express  image of his person. Again, Philip. 2:5,6 Let this mind be in you,  which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought  it not robbery to be equal with God.    Q. Was it by the Father and the Son that all things were created and  made that were created and made?    A. It was. Col 1:15,16,17 Who is the image of the invisible God, the  first born of every creature; for by him were all things created that  are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether  they be thrones or dominions, principalities or powers; all things were  created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all  things consist. Gen. 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and  the earth. Heb. 1:2 [God] Has in these last days spoken unto us by his  Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the  worlds.    Q. Does he possess the fullness of the Father?    A. He does. Col. 1:19. 2:9. For it pleased the Father that in him  should all fullness dwell. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the  Godhead bodily. Eph 1:23. Which is his [Christ's] body, the fullness of  him that fills all in all.    Q. Why was he called the Son?    A. Because of the flesh. Luke 1:33 That holy thing which shall be born  of thee, shall be called the Son of God.--Math. 3:16,17 And Jesus,  when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and lo,  the heavens were opened unto him, and he [John] saw the Spirit of God  descending like a dove and lighting upon him: and lo, a voice from  heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.    Q. Was he ordained of the Father, from before the foundation of the  world, to be a propitiation for the sins of all those who should  believe on his name?    A. He was. 1 Peter 1:18,19,20: Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not  redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain  conversation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the  precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without  spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,  but was manifested in these last times for you. Rev. 13:8 And all that  dwell upon the earth shall worship him [the beast] whose names are not  written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of  the world. 1 Corin. 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,  even the hidden mystery, which God ordained before the world unto our  glory.    Q. Do the Father and the Son possess the same mind?    A. They do. John 5:30. I [Christ] can of my own self do nothing: as I  hear, I judge, and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will,  but the will of the Father who sent me. John 6:38 For I [Christ] came  down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent  me. John 10:30. I [Christ] and my Father are one.    Q. What is this mind?    A. The Holy Spirit. John 15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I  will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which  proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me. [Christ]. Gal. 4:6.  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into  your hearts.    Q. Do the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit constitute the Godhead?    A. They do. [§5. ¶2.] Let the student commit this paragraph to memory.    Q. Do the believers in Christ Jesus, through the gift of the Spirit,  become one with the Father and the Son, as the Father and the Son are  one?    A. They do. John 17:20,21. Neither pray I for these (the apostles)  alone, but for them also who shall believe on me through their word;  that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,  that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou  hast sent me.    Q. Does the foregoing account of the Godhead lay a sure foundation for  the exercise of faith in him unto life and salvation?    A. It does.    Q. How do you prove it?    A. By the third paragraph of this lecture. Let the student commit this  also.        LECTURE SIXTH.    Of Faith.    SECTION VI.    1. Having treated, in the preceding lectures, of the ideas, of the  character, perfections and attributes of God, we next proceed to treat  of the knowledge which persons must have, that the course of life which  they pursue is according to the will of God, in order that they may be  enabled to exercise faith in him unto life and salvation.    2. This knowledge supplies an important place in revealed religion;  for it was by reason of it that the ancients were enabled to endure  as seeing him who is invisible. An actual knowledge to any person  that the course of life which he pursues is according to the will of  God, is essentially necessary to enable him to have that confidence  in God, without which no person can obtain eternal life. It was this  that enabled the ancient saints to endure all their afflictions and  persecutions, and to take joyfully the soiling of their goods, knowing  (not believing merely,) that they had a more enduring substance. Heb.  10:34.    3. Having the assurance that they were pursuing a course which was  agreeable to the will of God, they were enabled to take, not only the  spoiling of their goods, and the wasting of their substance, joyfully,  but also to suffer death in its most horrid forms; knowing, (not merely  believing,) that when this earthly house of their tabernacle was  dissolved, they had a building of God, a house not made with hands,  eternal in the heavens. Second Cor. 5:1.    4. Such was and always will be the situation of the saints of God, that  unless they have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing  is according to the will of God, they will grow weary in their minds  and faint; for such has been, and a ways will be, the opposition in the  hearts of unbelievers and those that know not God against the pure and  unadulterated religion of heaven, (the only thing which ensures eternal  life,) that they will persecute, to the uttermost, all that worship God  according to his revelations, receive the truth in the love of it, and  submit themselves to be guided and directed by his will, and drive them  to such extremities that nothing short of an actual knowledge of their  being the favorites of heaven, and of their having embraced that order  of things which God has established for the redemption of man, will  enable them to exercise that confidence in him, necessary for them to  overcome the world, and obtain that crown of glory which is laid up for  them that fear God.    5. For a man to lay down his all, his character and reputation, his  honor and applause, his good name among men, his houses, his lands,  his brothers and sisters, his wife and children, and even his own  life also, counting all things but filth and dross for the excellency  of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, requires more than mere belief, or  supposition that he is doing the will of God, but actual knowledge:  realizing, that when these sufferings are ended he will enter into  eternal rest; and be a partaker of the glory of God.    6. For unless a person does know that he is walking according to the  will of God, it would be offering an insult to the dignity of the  Creator, were he to say that he would be a partaker of his glory when  he should be done with the things of this life. But when he has this  knowledge, and most assuredly knows that he is doing the will of God,  his confidence can be equally strong that he will be a partaker of the  glory of God.    7. Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the  sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the  faith necessary unto life and salvation; for, from the first existence  of man, the faith necessary unto the enjoyment of life and salvation  never could be obtained without the sacrifice of all earthly things.  It was through this sacrifice, and this only, that God has ordained  that men should enjoy eternal life; and it is through the medium of the  sacrifice of all earthly things that men do actually know that they  are doing the things that are well pleasing in the sight of God. When  a man has offered in sacrifice all that he has, for the truth's sake,  not even withholding his life, and believing before God that he has  been called to make this sacrifice, because he seeks to do his will, he  does know, most assuredly, that God does and will accept his sacrifice  & offering, & that he has not nor will not seek his face in vain. Under  these circumstances, then, he can obtain the faith necessary for him to  lay hold on eternal life.    8. It is in vain for persons to fancy to themselves that they are heirs  with those, or can be heirs with them, who have offered their all in  sacrifice, and by this means obtained faith in God and favor with him  so as to obtain eternal life, unless they in like manner offer unto him  the same sacrifice, and through that offering obtain the knowledge that  they are accepted of him.    9. It was in offering sacrifices that Abel, the first martyr, obtained  knowledge that he was accepted of God. And from the days of righteous  Abel to the present time, the knowledge that men have that they are  accepted in the sight of God, is obtained by offering sacrifice: and  in the last days, before the Lord comes, he is to gather together his  saints who have made a covenant with him by sacrifice. Ps. 50: 3,4,5.  Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour  before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. He shall  call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge  his people. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a  covenant with me by sacrifice.    10. Those, then, who make the sacrifice will have the testimony that  their course is pleasing in the sight "]]]
