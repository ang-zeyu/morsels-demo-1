The mother was stirring porridge over the fire. Toinette went close  to her, but she did not move or turn her head.    \"How late the children are,\" she said at last, lifting the boiling  pot on the hob. Then she went to the stair-foot and called, \"Marc,  Jeanneton, Pierre, Marie. Breakfast is ready, my children. Toinette--but  where, then, is Toinette? She is used to be down long before this.\"    \"Toinette isn't upstairs,\" said Marie from above.    \"Her door is wide open, and she isn't there.\"    \"That is strange,\" said the mother. \"I have been here an hour, and she  has not passed this way since.\" She went to the outer door and called,  \"Toinette! Toinette!\" passing close to Toinette as she did so. And  looking straight at her with unseeing eyes. Toinette, half frightened,  half pleased, giggled low to herself. She really was invisible, then.  How strange it seemed and what fun it was going to be.    The children sat down to breakfast, little Jeanneton, as the youngest,  saying grace. The mother distributed the porridge and gave each a spoon  but she looked anxious.    \"Where can Toinette have gone?\" she said to herself. Toinette was  conscious-pricked. She was half inclined to dispel the charm on the  spot. But just then she caught a whisper from Pierre to Marc which so  surprised her as to put the idea out of her head.    \"Perhaps a wolf has eaten her up--a great big wolf like the 'Capuchon  Rouge,' you know.\" This was what Pierre said; and Marc answered  unfeelingly:    \"If he has, I shall ask mother to let me have her room for my own.\"    Poor Toinette, her cheeks burned and her eyes filled with tears at this.  Didn't the boys love her a bit then? Next she grew angry, and longed to  box Marc's ears, only she recollected in time that she was invisible.  What a bad boy he was, she thought.    The smoking porridge reminded her that she was hungry; so brushing away  the tears she slipped a spoon off the table and whenever she found the  chance, dipped it into the bowl for a mouthful. The porridge disappeared  rapidly.    \"I want some more,\" said Jeanneton.    \"Bless me, how fast you have eaten,\" said the mother, turning to the  bowl.    This made Toinette laugh, which shook her spoon, and a drop of the hot  mixture fell right on the tip of Marie's nose as she sat with upturned  face waiting her turn for a second helping. Marie gave a little scream.    \"What is it?\" said the mother.    \"Hot water! Right in my face!\" sputtered Marie.    \"Water!\" cried Marc. \"It's porridge.\"    \"You spattered with your spoon. Eat more carefully, my child,\" said the  mother, and Toinette laughed again as she heard her. After all, there  was some fun in being invisible.    The morning went by. Constantly the mother went to the door, and,  shading her eyes with her hand, looked out, in hopes of seeing a little  figure come down the wood-path, for she thought perhaps the child went  to the spring after water, and fell asleep there. The children played  happily, meanwhile. They were used to doing without Toinette and did not  seem to miss her, except that now and then baby Jeanneton said: \"Poor  Toinette gone--not here--all gone.\"    \"Well, what if she has?\" said Marc at last looking up from the wooden  cup he was carving for Marie's doll. \"We can play all the better.\"    Marc was a bold, outspoken boy, who always told his whole mind about  things.    \"If she were here,\" he went on,\" she'd only scold and interfere.  Toinette almost always scolds. I like to have her go away. It makes it  pleasanter.\"    \"It is rather pleasanter,\" admitted Marie, \"only I'd like her to be  having a nice time somewhere else.\"    \"Bother about Toinette,\" cried Pierre.    \"Let's play 'My godmother has cabbage to sell.'\"    I don't think Toinette had ever felt so unhappy in her life, as when she  stood by unseen, and heard the children say these words. She had never  meant to be unkind to them, but she was quick-tempered, dreamy, wrapped  up in herself. She did not like being interrupted by them, it put her  out, and she spoke sharply and was cross. She had taken it for granted  that the others must love her, by a sort of right, and the knowledge  that they did not grieved over very much. Creeping away, she hid herself  in the woods. It was a sparkling day, but the sun did not look so bright  as usual. Cuddled down under a rosebush, Toinette sat sobbing as if her  heart would break at the recollection of the speeches she had overheard.    By and by a little voice within her woke up and began to make itself  audible. All of us know this little voice. We call it conscience.    \"Jeanneton missed me,\" she thought. \"And, oh, dear! I pushed her away  only last night and wouldn't tell her a story. And Marie hoped I was  having a pleasant time somewhere. I wish I hadn't slapped Marie last  Friday. And I wish I hadn't thrown Marc's ball into the fire that day I  was angry with him. How unkind he was to say that--but I wasn't always  kind to him. And once I said that I wished a bear would eat Pierre up.  That was because he broke my cup. Oh, dear, oh, dear. What a bad girl  I've been to them all.\"    \"But you could be better and kinder if you tried, couldn't you?\" said  the inward voice. \"I think you could.\"    And Toinette clasped her hands tight and said out loud: \"I could.  Yes--and I will.\"    The first thing to be done was to get rid of the fern-seed which she now  regarded as a hateful thing. She untied her shoes and shook it out in  the grass. It dropped and seemed to melt into the air, for it instantly  vanished. A mischievous laugh sounded close behind, and a beetle-green  coat-tail was visible whisking under a tuft of rushes. But Toinette  had had enough of the elves, and, tying her shoes, took the road toward  home, running with all her might.    \"Where have you been all day, Toinette?\" cried the children, as,  breathless and panting, she flew in at the gate. But Toinette could not  speak. She made slowly for her mother, who stood in the doorway, flung  herself into her arms and burst into a passion of tears.    \"Ma cherie, what is it, whence hast thou come?\" asked the good mother  alarmed. She lifted Toinette into her arms as she spoke, and hastened  indoors. The other children followed, whispering and peeping, but the  mother sent them away, and sitting down by the fire with Toinette in her  lap, she rocked and hushed and comforted, as though Toinette had been  again a little baby. Gradually the sobs ceased. For a while Toinette  lay quiet, with her head on her mother's breast. Then she wiped her wet  eyes, put her arms around her mother's neck, and told her all from the  very beginning, keeping not a single thing back. The dame listened with  alarm.    \"Saints protect us,\" she muttered. Then feeling Toinette's hands and  head, \"Thou hast a fever,\" she said. \"I will make thee a tisane, my  darling, and thou must at once go to bed.\" Toinette vainly protested;  to bed she went and perhaps it was the wisest thing, for the warm drink  threw her into a long sound sleep and when she woke she was herself  again, bright and well, hungry for dinner, and ready to do her usual  tasks.    Herself--but not quite the same Toinette that she had been before.  Nobody changes from bad to better in a minute. It takes time for that,  time and effort, and a long struggle with evil habits and tempers. But  there is sometimes a certain minute or day in which people begin to  change, and thus it was with Toinette. The fairy lesson was not lost  upon her. She began to fight with herself, to watch her faults and try  to conquer them. It was hard work; often she felt discouraged, but she  kept on. Week after week and month after month she grew less selfish,  kinder, more obliging than she used to be. When she failed and her old  fractious temper got the better of her, she was sorry and begged every  one's pardon so humbly that they could not but forgive. The mother  began to think that the elves really had bewitched her child. As for the  children they learned to love Toinette as never before, and came to her  with all their pains and pleasures, as children should to a kind older  sister. Each fresh proof of this, every kiss from Jeanneton, every  confidence from Marc, was a comfort to Toinette, for she never forgot  Christmas Day, and felt that no trouble was too much to wipe out that  unhappy recollection. \"I think they like me better than they did then,\"  she would say; but then the thought came, \"Perhaps if I were invisible  again, if they did not know I was there, I might hear something to make  me feel as badly as I did that morning.\" These sad thoughts were part of  the bitter fruit of the fairy fern-seed.    So with doubts and fears the year went by, and again it was Christmas  Eve. Toinette had been asleep some hours when she was roused by a sharp  tapping at the window pane. Startled, and only half awake, she sat up in  bed and saw by the moonlight a tiny figure outside which she recognized.  It was Thistle drumming with his knuckles on the glass.    \"Let me in,\" cried the dry little voice. So Toinette opened the  casement, and Thistle flew in and perched as before on the coverlet.    \"Merry Christmas, my girl.\" he said, \"and a Happy New Year when it  comes. I've brought you a present;\" and, dipping into a pouch tied round  his waist, he pulled out a handful of something brown. Toinette knew  what it was in a moment.    \"Oh, no,\" she cried shrinking back. \"Don't give me any fern-seeds. They  frighten me. I don't like them.\"    \"Don't be silly,\" said Thistle, his voice sounding kind this time, and  earnest. \"It wasn't pleasant being invisible last year, but perhaps this  year it will be. Take my advice, and try it. You'll not be sorry.\"    \"Sha'n't I?\" said Toinette, brightening. \"Very well, then, I will.\" She  leaned out of bed, and watched Thistle strew the fine dustlike grains in  each shoe.    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],[0,"Dave Dawson at Singapore (#11)"],[1,"by magic. Two dirty  cracked cups the size of thumb thimbles were placed in front of him  and Freddy. In the cups was a smudgy brown liquid that no white man  would even use to paint the side of a cow-barn. An acrid stench drifted  up from each cup. It made Dave think of burning sulphur and kerosene,  only not so sweet smelling. As a matter of fact, for one crazy instant  he wondered if it was some deadly chemical that was going to explode in  his face in the next second and blind him. He killed off that thought,  however, and whipped out his hand to grab the native's arm as the man  started to glide away.    \"The cigarettes!\" he growled. \"I gave you enough to feed your filthy  family for years. Bring us the cigarettes!\"    The native waiter's eyes glowed up for a moment in a look of deadly  hatred. But his gaze soon fell before Dave's steely one. He bobbed  his head, mumbled something, and hurried away. Dave turned back to  the table and picked up his cup and looked at Freddy Farmer. Suddenly  he was convinced that it was do or die now, or never. He held the cup  native style between his two hands, and leaned forward toward Freddy  Farmer and opened his mouth to speak. But what he was about to say died  in his throat. It died because in that same instant the front door of  the Devil's Den was suddenly slammed open and two Singapore policemen  came bursting into the room.    \"_Brenti!_\" one of them screamed.    It was the Malay word for \"Halt!\" and every man in the room, including  Serrangi, himself, froze stiff in whatever position he happened to be.          CHAPTER EIGHT    _The Secret Message_      Like a pair of killers who would love nothing better than to blast  away in all directions with the police pistols they clutched, the two  Singapore policemen stood straddle legged, their black eyes seeming  to focus on every face at the same time. The Devil's Den was suddenly  filled with pin-dropping silence. It was more the silence of sudden  death. Dave's heart slammed like a trip-hammer against his ribs, and he  was sure that the sound carried throughout the room like a booming drum.    Here was something that Air Vice Marshal Bostworth hadn't so much as  mentioned as a bare possibility. A raid on Serrangi's place by the  native police. Supposing they were all dragged in? What would he and  Freddy do? How would they be able to get out of the clutches of the  local law? True, they could establish their true identities in short  order. Sure, and probably be released with a thousand heart felt  apologies! But a fine lot of good that would do them! Their opportunity  would then be gone forever. Be gone because there were certain to be  listening ears at police headquarters. Ears that would hear what they  said. And a tongue or two that would take a warning back to Serrangi's.  No, if they left the Devil's Den with the native police for questioning  they would never enter Serrangi's again. They both would be dead before  they could get both feet inside.    Yet the alternative was just as bad. Perhaps worse. If they posed as  coming from a torpedoed boat headed for Australia their stories would  be checked within the hour by police officials ... and be found as full  of holes as a rusted sieve. As a result they would be thrown into a  jail cell in nothing flat, and be kept there until they rotted before  they could convince their jailers of the truth. Yes, it was something  that Air Vice Marshal Bostworth hadn't even dreamed of, to say nothing  of themselves. A choice of two things ... and both evil and spelling  bad luck, or worse.    And so Dave's heart pounded even more furiously against his ribs as the  two policemen seemed to focus their attention on Freddy and him. Was  this the moment? Was this the end of something that had hardly had a  beginning? Those questions and others burned through Dave's brain like  liquid fire. He wanted to look at Freddy to see how his pal was taking  it, but he didn't dare take his eyes off the two policemen.    Then suddenly the pair started walking slowly down the length of the  room. Whenever they came to a man who was dead to the world, and had  not lifted his head at their arrival, one of them would grab him by  the hair, jerk up his head and glare at the man's face. One swift  scrutinizing stare and then the man's head would flop down on his  folded arms again, or sag chin down on his chest and roll from side to  side like a toy balloon in a gentle breeze.    Eventually the two Singapore policemen came abreast of Dawson's table.  For one horrible moment he lived and died a thousand times over. Then  the policemen passed on to the next table to the rear. In time they  reached Serrangi standing by the coffee urns. Dave heard the soft sound  as the pair spoke, and the harsh nerve-grating replies from Serrangi's  lips. But he didn't understand the tongue. And then, finally, when  Dave's nerves were almost ready to fly apart in all directions,  the two policemen wheeled about, stalked back to the front door and  disappeared.    Dave held his breath waiting for the babble of sound to come from the  many tongues in the place. But he was doomed to disappointment if he  expected the coffee shop customers to show any excitement over the  visit. They simply relaxed in their chairs, shrugged slightly at their  next table neighbors, and continued on doing whatever it was they had  been doing when the policemen burst into the room.    To cover his own almost overwhelming sense of relief Dave slumped over  the table edge and cupped his chin in both hands and stared down at the  still untouched cup of smudgey brown coffee. It was then he suddenly  realized that the dirty native was no longer seated at the adjoining  table. The man had disappeared as though by magic. Dave blinked at the  empty chair and then quickly lowered his eyes.    \"Our pal has scrammed,\" he breathed just loud enough for Freddy to  hear. \"Did he go through the floor or just evaporate in the smokey air?\"    \"Neither,\" came the hushed reply. \"He slid along in back of the two  bobbies. Talking with Serrangi, now. Steady! Here he comes back again.\"    \"Don't ever miss a trick, do you!\" Dave murmured and reached for his  coffee cup. \"Well, I'm going to pull the code words this time. I'll go  plain bats if this suspense keeps up much longer. Luck to us, pal.\"    \"And we'll probably need it, Dave. Right-o. Fire away!\"    Dave waited until the shadow of the passing native fell directly across  the table. Then he started the coffee cup to his lips and looked at  Freddy.    \"_Der Fuehrer's Tag!_\" he grunted and put his lips to the vile smelling  cup.    \"_Ja, ja!_\" Freddy Farmer grunted in reply. \"_Der Fuehrer's Tag._ It  cannot come soon enough to please me!\"    Both spoke in pure German, and both held their breath as the shadow  of the passing native seemed to linger a second on the table. Then it  passed on by, and it was all either of them could do to refrain from  turning around and staring directly at the man. With an effort though,  they remained seated as they were. And with a thousand times greater  effort they forced themselves to sip a little of the most horrible  liquid they had ever tasted in their lives. It took every ounce of  Dave's will power not to spit it out. Instead, though, he forced it  down and had the sensation of a couple of red hot coals dropping clear  down to the pit of his stomach. He waited a full minute before he dared  to speak.    \"Are you still alive, Freddy?\" he whispered. \"I'm not sure just how I  feel.\"    \"I think, so,\" the English youth whispered back. \"At any rate, I can  still talk, and see and hear. But I think we'd better not talk much,  Dave. Serrangi is taking interest in us again. It's possible that he  might be a lip reader.\"    \"Or has eyes in the back of his head like you seem to have,\" Dave  murmured. \"How you can look two ways at the same time, I'll never be  able to.... What's up?\"    Dave cut himself off and asked the last as he saw Freddy's hand resting  on the table suddenly stiffen. The English youth didn't reply for a  moment. Then he spoke loudly in bad French.    \"Those cigarettes!\" he exclaimed. \"Do we get them, or must we go  someplace where they don't steal a poor man's money?\"    As the English youth spoke he glared at the native waiter who was busy  about something over on the other side of the room. Then as he slouched  back in his chair again he flashed Dave a warning look.    \"Serrangi just nodded to somebody in back of us!\" he breathed behind a  hand that pawed at his mouth. \"To some one in back of us! Our little  friend, of course. I wonder what it means?\"    \"I wouldn't know,\" Dave grunted. \"But I sure am hoping like blazes. For  the best, I mean. Oh-oh!\"    The native had suddenly appeared at Dave's elbow. But the man didn't  stop. He glided on by toward the rear of the room. As he passed,  though, Dave caught the quick motion of one hand, and saw the tiny  pellet pop from the man's fingers, and roll across the table to come to  a stop not three inches from Dave's cup of coffee. Freddy saw it, too,  and sucked in his breath in a soft hiss of excitement. Dave didn't look  at him, or at the little pellet resting on the table. Instead he stared  unconcernedly at the front door, and absently dropped one hand down  over the pellet.    For a couple of minutes he seemingly took no interest at all in  anything, but as a matter of fact his heart was thumping, and the  pellet, which was a wadded up bit of paper, seemed to burn like a hot  coal under his hand. At the end of two minutes, which passed like an  eternity of taunting suspense, Dave drew his hand off the table, and  brought the little pellet of paper along with it. Another couple of  seconds and he had both hands in his lap, shielded from all eyes by  the edge of the table, and was feverishly smoothing out the wadded  paper with his fingers. He knew that Freddy Farmer was watching him out  the"]]]
