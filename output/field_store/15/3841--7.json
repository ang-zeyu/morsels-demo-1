The second principal ingredient of the blood is contained in the  serum, and gives to this liquid all the properties of the white of  eggs, with which it is indeed identical. When heated, it coagulates  into a white elastic mass, and the coagulating substance is called  albumen.    Fibrine and albumen, the chief ingredients of blood, contain, in  all, seven chemical elements, among which nitrogen, phosphorus, and  sulphur are found. They contain also the earth of bones. The serum  retains in solution sea salt and other salts of potash and soda, in  which the acids are carbonic, phosphoric, and sulphuric acids. The  globules of the blood contain fibrine and albumen, along with a red  colouring matter, in which iron is a constant element. Besides  these, the blood contains certain fatty bodies in small quantity,  which differ from ordinary fats in several of their properties.    Chemical analysis has led to the remarkable result, that fibrine and  albumen contain the same organic elements united in the same  proportion,--i.e., that they are isomeric, their chemical  composition--the proportion of their ultimate elements--being  identical. But the difference of their external properties shows  that the particles of which they are composed are arranged in a  different order. (See Letter V).    This conclusion has lately been beautifully confirmed by a  distinguished physiologist (Denis), who has succeeded in converting  fibrine into albumen, that is, in giving it the solubility, and  coagulability by heat, which characterise the white of egg.    Fibrine and albumen, besides having the same composition, agree also  in this, that both dissolve in concentrated muriatic acid, yielding  a solution of an intense purple colour. This solution, whether made  with fibrine or albumen, has the very same re-actions with all  substances yet tried.    Both albumen and fibrine, in the process of nutrition, are capable  of being converted into muscular fibre, and muscular fibre is  capable of being reconverted into blood. These facts have long been  established by physiologists, and chemistry has merely proved that  these metamorphoses can be accomplished under the influence of a  certain force, without the aid of a third substance, or of its  elements, and without the addition of any foreign element, or the  separation of any element previously present in these substances.    If we now compare the composition of all organised parts with that  of fibrine and albumen, the following relations present themselves:--    All parts of the animal body which have a decided shape, which form  parts of organs, contain nitrogen. No part of an organ which  possesses motion and life is destitute of nitrogen; all of them  contain likewise carbon and the elements of water; the latter,  however, in no case in the proportion to form water.    The chief ingredients of the blood contain nearly 17 per cent. of  nitrogen, and from numerous analyses it appears that no part of an  organ contains less than 17 per cent. of nitrogen.    The most convincing experiments and observations have proved that  the animal body is absolutely incapable of producing an elementary  body, such as carbon or nitrogen, out of substances which do not  contain it; and it obviously follows, that all kinds of food fit for  the production either of blood, or of cellular tissue, membranes,  skin, hair, muscular fibre, &c., must contain a certain amount of  nitrogen, because that element is essential to the composition of  the above-named organs; because the organs cannot create it from the  other elements presented to them; and, finally, because no nitrogen  is absorbed from the atmosphere in the vital process.    The substance of the brain and nerves contains a large quantity of  albumen, and, in addition to this, two peculiar fatty acids,  distinguished from other fats by containing phosphorus (phosphoric  acid?). One of these contains nitrogen (Fremy).    Finally, water and common fat are those ingredients of the body  which are destitute of nitrogen. Both are amorphous or unorganised,  and only so far take part in the vital process as that their  presence is required for the due performance of the vital functions.  The inorganic constituents of the body are, iron, lime, magnesia,  common salt, and the alkalies.    The nutritive process is seen in its simplest form in carnivorous  animals. This class of animals lives on the blood and flesh of the  graminivora; but this blood and flesh are, in all their properties,  identical with their own. Neither chemical nor physiological  differences can be discovered.    The nutriment of carnivorous animals is derived originally from  blood; in their stomach it becomes dissolved, and capable of  reaching all other parts of the body; in its passage it is again  converted into blood, and from this blood are reproduced all those  parts of their organisation which have undergone change or  metamorphosis.    With the exception of hoofs, hair, feathers, and the earth of bones,  every part of the food of carnivorous animals is capable of  assimilation.    In a chemical sense, therefore, it may be said that a carnivorous  animal, in supporting the vital process, consumes itself. That which  serves for its nutrition is identical with those parts of its  organisation which are to be renewed.    The process of nutrition in graminivorous animals appears at first  sight altogether different. Their digestive organs are less simple,  and their food consists of vegetables, the great mass of which  contains but little nitrogen.    From what substances, it may be asked, is the blood formed, by means  of which of their organs are developed? This question may be  answered with certainty.    Chemical researches have shown, that all such parts of vegetables as  can afford nutriment to animals contain certain constituents which  are rich in nitrogen; and the most ordinary experience proves that  animals require for their support and nutrition less of these parts  of plants in proportion as they abound in the nitrogenised  constituents. Animals cannot be fed on matters destitute of these  nitrogenised constituents.    These important products of vegetation are especially abundant in  the seeds of the different kinds of grain, and of peas, beans, and  lentils; in the roots and the juices of what are commonly called  vegetables. They exist, however, in all plants, without exception,  and in every part of plants in larger or smaller quantity.    These nitrogenised forms of nutriment in the vegetable kingdom may  be reduced to three substances, which are easily distinguished by  their external characters. Two of them are soluble in water, the  third is insoluble.    When the newly-expressed juices of vegetables are allowed to stand,  a separation takes place in a few minutes. A gelatinous precipitate,  commonly of a green tinge, is deposited, and this, when acted on by  liquids which remove the colouring matter, leaves a grayish white  substance, well known to druggists as the deposite from vegetable  juices. This is one of the nitrogenised compounds which serves for  the nutrition of animals, and has been named vegetable fibrine. The  juice of grapes is especially rich in this constituent, but it is  most abundant in the seeds of wheat, and of the cerealia generally.  It may be obtained from wheat flour by a mechanical operation, and  in a state of tolerable purity; it is then called gluten, but the  glutinous property belongs, not to vegetable fibrine, but to a  foreign substance, present in small quantity, which is not found in  the other cerealia.    The method by which it is obtained sufficiently proves that it is  insoluble in water; although we cannot doubt that it was originally  dissolved in the vegetable juice, from which it afterwards  separated, exactly as fibrine does from blood.    The second nitrogenised compound remains dissolved in the juice  after the separation of the fibrine. It does not separate from the  juice at the ordinary temperature, but is instantly coagulated when  the liquid containing it is heated to the boiling point.    When the clarified juice of nutritious vegetables, such as  cauliflower, asparagus, mangelwurzel, or turnips, is made to boil, a  coagulum is formed, which it is absolutely impossible to distinguish  from the substance which separates as a coagulum, when the serum of  blood, or the white of an egg, diluted with water, are heated to the  boiling point. This is vegetable albumen. It is found in the  greatest abundance in certain seeds, in nuts, almonds, and others,  in which the starch of the gramineae is replaced by oil.    The third nitrogenised constituent of the vegetable food of animals  is vegetable caseine. It is chiefly found in the seeds of peas,  beans, lentils, and similar leguminous seeds. Like vegetable  albumen, it is soluble in water, but differs from it in this, that  its solution is not coagulated by heat. When the solution is heated  or evaporated, a skin forms on its surface, and the addition of an  acid causes a coagulum, just as in animal milk.    These three nitrogenised compounds, vegetable fibrine, albumen, and  caseine, are the true nitrogenised constituents of the food of  graminivorous animals; all other nitrogenised compounds occurring in  plants, are either rejected by animals, as in the case of the  characteristic principles of poisonous and medicinal plants, or else  they occur in the food in such very small proportion, that they  cannot possibly contribute to the increase of mass in the animal  body.    The chemical analysis of these three substances has led to the very  interesting result that they contain the same organic elements,  united in the same proportion by weight; and, what is still more  remarkable, that they are identical in composition with the chief  constituents of blood, animal fibrine, and albumen. They all three  dissolve in concentrated muriatic acid with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45303"],[0,"The Life of John Taylor (#11)"],[1,"angels sang aloud--               In Adam-ondi-Ahman.        Her land was good and greatly blest,      Beyond old Israel's Canaan;      Her fame was known from east to west,      Her peace was great, and pure the rest               Of Adam-ondi-Ahman.        Hosanna to such days to come--      The Savior's second coming,      When all the earth in glorious bloom      Affords the saints a holy home,               Like Adam-ondi-Ahman.    At the conclusion of the hymn, Elder Alpheus Cutler, the master workman  of the Lord's House, laid the south-east corner stone in its position,  and stated that in consequence of the peculiar situation of the Saints  it was deemed prudent to discontinue further labor on the house until  the Lord should open the way for its completion. The Apostles then took  leave of some seventeen Saints who were present, and started on their  way to fill their missions beyond the Atlantic.    On their way they stopped at Quincy, where they met the Prophet Joseph,  who had lately escaped from the hands of his enemies in Missouri. The  Prophet heartily approved the labors of the Twelve, and their course  received also the commendation of the Church in a general conference  assembled at Quincy.    The Saints that same spring began settling at Commerce, afterwards  Nauvoo, on the east bank of the Mississippi, in Hancock County,  Illinois. By this time the reaction from the excitement in which they  had lived for more than a year, set in, and almost the entire people  sank down from exhaustion, and became an easy prey to the malaria  prevalent in the district at that time.    In the midst of this sickness, poverty and general wretchedness, Elder  Taylor made his preparations to continue his journey to England. He  had secured quarters for his family, in connection with others, in  miserable, old log barracks in Montrose, a small settlement opposite  Nauvoo, in what was then the Territory of Iowa.    It was the 8th of August that he left Montrose to fill his mission. He  dedicated his wife and family to the care of the Lord, and blessed them  in His name: \"The thought of the hardships they had just endured,\" he  remarks, \"the uncertainty of their continuing in the house they then  occupied--and that only a solitary room--the prevalence of disease,  the poverty of the brethren, their insecurity from mobs, together with  the uncertainty of what might take place during my absence, produced  feelings of no ordinary character. These solicitations, paternal and  conjugal, were enhanced also by the time and distance that was to  separate us. But the thought of going forth at the command of the  God of Israel to revisit my native land, to unfold the principles of  eternal truth and make known the things that God had revealed for the  salvation of the world, overcame every other feeling.\"    In Nauvoo Elder Taylor joined Wilford Woodruff, who was scarcely able  to drag himself along, and who remarked that he felt and looked more  like a subject for the dissecting room than a missionary. After taking  leave of the Prophet and his counselors, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith,  Elder Taylor and his sick companion left Nauvoo.    On the outskirts of the settlement they passed Parley P. Pratt and  Heber C. Kimball, who were building a log house. Parley, who, it  will be remembered, had carried the gospel to Elder Taylor, was  stripped--bare headed and bare footed. He hailed the brethren as they  were passing and gave them a purse, it was all he had. Elder Heber C.  Kimball, who was but a short distance away, stripped as Elder Pratt  was, came up and said, \"As Brother Parley has given you a purse, I have  a dollar I will give you to put in it.\" Then mutually blessing each  other, they said farewell. Elders Taylor and Woodruff were the first of  their quorum to start on their mission.    At Macomb they found Brother Zebedee Coltrin, who proposed taking them  as far as Cleveland, Ohio, in his wagon, a proposition they gladly  accepted. At this place a Brother Miller, whom Elder Taylor baptized  while there, gave them a horse, and another a saddle and bridle. At  Springfield a broker sold his horse for him, and with the proceeds he  published a pamphlet on the persecutions of the Saints in Missouri. The  edition was 2,000. A portion of these pamphlets were left in the hands  of Elder Coltrin to dispose of, the proceeds to be given to Sisters  Taylor and Woodruff.    Elder Taylor's strong constitution and iron will had carried him  through the Missouri troubles and the trying scenes of poverty and  sickness which prevailed that summer about Nauvoo; but as he traveled  eastward his health began failing him. Approaching Indianapolis he was  taken with violent vomiting and afterwards fainted by the wagon in the  road. It was with some difficulty that his companions resuscitated him  and conveyed him to the house of Brother Horace S. Eldredge, where he  received the kindest treatment. Notwithstanding there were rest and  attention for him at the home of Brother Eldredge until he should be  restored, weak as he was, he continued his journey next morning. He  would travel all day and frequently preach at night, though scarcely  able to stand upon his feet.    At Germantown, in Indiana, his strength again failed him; and seeing  no prospect of immediate recovery, he advised Brothers Woodruff and  Coltrin to proceed on their journey without him. This they reluctantly  did.    The name of the proprietor of the hotel in Germantown where he stopped  was Jacob Waltz; both from himself and his wife Elder Taylor received  the kindest attention.    After a severe illness of two weeks, during which time he was reduced  to a mere skeleton, he began to recover; and with returning health came  the old burning desire to preach the gospel; and before he was fairly  able to stand he obtained the court house adjacent to his hotel and  began holding meetings, though he had to sit part of the time while  delivering his discourses.    One thing that much surprised those who listened to him was that,  although he was a long distance from his home and friends, and had been  prostrate with sickness among strangers, and on expenses, he never  alluded to these things or begged for assistance. What a contrast  between this servant of God and the sectarian priests of the day! Had  one of their number been similarly situated, what a tale of woe would  have been told of his heroic suffering for the gospel's sake, and  what pathetic appeals would have been made to the generous who, loved  the Lord, for assistance! But this Apostle of Jesus Christ bore all  patiently, more anxious to deliver the message he bore than secure his  own comfort. At last a gentleman waited upon him, and asking to be  excused for the liberty he was about to take, referred to the above  matters in the following manner:    \"Mr. Taylor, you do not act as most preachers do; you have said nothing  about your circumstances or money, yet you have been here some time  sick; your doctor's, hotel and other bills must be heavy. Some friends  and myself have talked these matters over and would like to assist you,  though we do not wish to give any offense.\"    In replying to this Elder Taylor thanked the gentleman, and said:    \"I preach without purse or scrip, leaving the Lord to manage those  matters you speak of in His own way; and as you have been prompted by  the Lord and your own generous impulses, I shall thankfully receive  whatever assistance you are disposed to render me.\"    The gentleman then presented him a small sum of money, which, with what  he had, was sufficient to settle all his bills and enable him to pursue  his journey.    Commenting upon the above incident, Elder Taylor says: \"I would rather  put my trust in the Lord than in any of the kings of the earth.\"    Bidding farewell to his kind host and other friends in Germantown, he  started for Dayton, Ohio. The first day out he reached the town of  Richmond, at 5 o'clock, and two hours later he was lecturing to a large  audience on the \"Mormon Difficulties in Missouri,\" and the next day was  on his way to Dayton.    Here he remained a few days preaching the gospel, and then had a  serious relapse which confined him to the house of a friend, a Brother  Brown, for two weeks. As he was recovering from his illness and  preparing to leave Dayton, he was agreeably surprised to learn of the  arrival of his fellow Apostle, George A. Smith, and others. Elder Smith  was on his way to England also, and as there was room in his wagon, he  invited Elder Taylor to ride with him--a proposition that was gladly  accepted.    Together they traveled to Kirtland where they met Elders Brigham Young  and Heber C. Kimball. Here Elder Taylor was again stricken down by  sickness; but through the blessings of God he recovered sufficiently to  accompany his brethren on their way to New York. They arrived in that  city in due time, and were cordially welcomed to the house of Parley  P. Pratt, whom Elder Taylor had left in Nauvoo a few months before,  putting up a log house; but who was now presiding over a large branch  of the Church in the metropolis of the United States.    I have been particular to relate the details of this trying journey  from Nauvoo to New York, that the readers of this work may have a  knowledge of the difficulties encountered by Elder Taylor, in his  efforts to comply with the requirement of God to preach the gospel in  his native land. Truly he went forth weeping, but bearing precious  seed; and we shall see, anon, how he returned rejoicing, bringing his  sheaves with him.    Footnotes    1.
