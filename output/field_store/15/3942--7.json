With this number, in addition  to our own small group, we consider that we form quite a respectable  gathering. The congregation all arrive on horseback, each attended by at  least two big colley dogs; the horses are turned into the paddock, the  saddles deposited in the back verandah, and the dogs lie quietly down  by their respective masters' equipments until they are ready to start  homewards. There is something very wild and touching in these Sunday  services. If the weather is quite clear and warm, they are held in the  verandah; but unless it is a very sunny afternoon, it is too early in  the year yet for this.    The shepherds are a very fine class of men as a rule, and I find them  most intelligent; they lead solitary lives, and are fond of reading; and  as I am anxious to substitute a better sort of literature in their  huts than the tattered yellow volumes which generally form their scanty  library, I lend them books from my own small collection. But, as I  foresee that this supply will soon be exhausted, we have started a Book  Club, and sent to London for twenty pounds' worth of books as a first  instalment. We shall get them second-hand from a large library, so I  hope to receive a good boxful. The club consists of twenty-eight members  now, and will probably amount to thirty-two, which is wonderful for  this district. At the close of a year from the first distribution of the  books they are to be divided into lots as near as possible in value to  a pound each, the parcels to be numbered, and corresponding figures  written on slips of paper, which are to be shaken up in a hat and drawn  at random, each member claiming the parcel of which the number answers  to that on his ticket. This is the fairest way I can think of for the  distribution, and every one seems satisfied with the scheme. The most  popular books are those of travel or adventure; unless a novel is really  very good indeed, they do not care about it.    The last little item of home news with which I must close this month's  budget is, that F---- has been away for a few days on a skating  excursion. A rather distant neighbour of ours called on his way up to  the station far back among the hills, and gave such a glowing account of  the condition of the ice in that part of the country, that F----, who is  very fond of the amusement, was persuaded to accompany him. Our friend  is the son of the Bishop, and owns a large station about twenty-six  miles from this. At the back of his run the hills rise to a great  height, and nestled among them lie a chain of lakes, after the largest  of which (Lake Coleridge) Mr. H----'s station is named. On one of the  smaller lakes, called by the classical name of \"Ida,\" the ice attains to  a great thickness; for it is surrounded by such lofty hills that during  the winter months the sun hardly touches it, and it is commonly reported  that a heavily-laden bullock-dray could cross it in perfect safety.  F----was away nearly a week, and appears to have enjoyed himself  thoroughly, though it will seem to you more of hard work than amusement;  for he and Mr. H----, and some other gentlemen who were staying there,  used to mount directly after breakfast, with their skates tied to their  saddle-bow, and ride twelve miles to Lake Ida, skate all through the  short winter's day, lunching at the solitary hut of a gentleman-farmer  close by the lake, and when it grew dusk riding home again. The  gentlemen in this country are in such good training through constant  exercise, that they appear able to stand any amount of fatigue without  minding it.          Letter XII: My first expedition.      Broomielaw, October 1866. This ought to be early spring, but the weather  is really colder and more disagreeable than any which winter brought us;  and, proverbially fickle as spring sunshine and showers are in England,  ours is a far more capricious and trying season. Twice during this month  have I been a victim to these sudden changes of climate; on the first  occasion it was most fortunate that we had reached the shelter of a  friendly and hospitable roof, for it was three days before we could  re-cross the mountain-pass which lay between us and home. One beautiful  spring morning F---- asked me if I would like to ride across the hills,  and pay my first visit to some kind and old friends of his, who were  among the earliest arrivals in the province, and who have made a lovely  home for themselves at the foot of a great Bush on the other side of  our range. I was delighted at the idea, for I have had very little  opportunity of going about since we came here, owing to the short  winter days and the amount of occupation at home consequent on a new  establishment.    Directly after breakfast, the horses were caught and saddled, and we  started in high spirits. As we rode up the long, sunny valley stretching  away for miles at the back of the house, F---- pointed out to me, with  all a sheep-farmer's pride, the hundreds of pretty little curly-fleeced  lambs skipping about the low hill-sides. After we passed our own  boundary fence we came upon a very bad track,--this is the name by which  all roads are called, and they do not deserve a better,--but it was the  only path to our destination. The air was mild and balmy, and the sun  shone brightly as we slowly picked our way across bogs and creeks,  and up and down steep, slippery hill-sides; but just as we reached the  lowest saddle of the range and prepared to descend, a cold wind met us.  In an instant the sunshine was overclouded, and F----, pointing to  a grey bank of cloud moving quickly towards us, said, \"There is a  tremendous sou'-wester coming up; we had better push on for shelter,  or you'll be drowned:\" but, alas! at each step the road grew worse and  worse; where it was level the ground was literally honeycombed with deep  holes half full of water, and at last we came to a place where the  horse had to descend a flight of stone steps, each step being extremely  slippery and some way below the other; and at the bottom of this  horrible staircase there was a wide jump to be taken, the spring being  off the lowest step, and the jump upwards alighting on a steep bank up  which the horses scrambled like cats. Getting wet through appeared to  me a very minor evil compared to the dangers of such a road, but F----  urged me forward, with assurances that the horse knew the path perfectly  well and could carry me at a gallop quite safely; but it was impossible  to infuse sufficient courage into my drooping heart to induce me to go  faster than a walk.    All this time the storm drew rapidly nearer, the wind blew in icy cold  gusts, the hail came down in large stones, pelting our faces till  they tingled again; it was nearly an hour before we rode up to the  hospitable, ever-open porch door of Rockwood. I was immediately lifted  off my saddle by kind and strong arms, and carried with frozen limbs  and streaming habit into the kitchen, for I was as unfit for the  drawing-room as my own water-spaniel. A blazing wood fire was hastily  lighted in one of the bed-rooms, and thither the good hostess conveyed  me. I emerged from that apartment the most extraordinary figure you ever  saw. Imagine me arrayed in a short and very wide crinoline, over which  was a bright-coloured linsey petticoat; an old pilot-coat for a jacket,  huge carpet slippers on my feet, and my dripping hair hanging loose  over my shoulders! I assure you, I looked like the portraits in books of  travel, of the Tahitian women when they first assumed clothes; and the  worst of it was, that I had to remain in this costume for three whole  days. To return was impossible, the storm from the S.W. raged all that  evening. When we opened our eyes next morning, snow was lying some  inches deep, and still falling fast; there was no cessation for  forty-eight hours, and then we had to give it time to thaw a little, so  that it was Sunday morning before we started on our homeward ride.  In the meantime, nothing could afford a greater contrast to the wild  weather out of doors than the snug brightness within. Blazing logs of  pine and black birch made every room warm and cheery; all day we chatted  and amused ourselves in different ways (I learned to make a capital  pudding, and acquainted myself with the mysteries of \"junket\"); in the  evenings we had whist for an hour, and then either round games or songs.  The young men of the house have nice voices and a great feeling for  music, and some of the trios and glees went very well indeed. The only  thing which spoilt my enjoyment was the constantly recurring remembrance  of that terrible road. F---- tried to comfort me by assurances that the  snow would have filled up the worst places so much that I should not see  them, but, strange to say, I failed to derive any consolation from that  idea; however, we accomplished the journey back safely, but with many  slips and slides. As soon as we came on our own run, F----began to look  out for dead lambs, but fortunately there were not many for him to mourn  over; they must have taken shelter under the low hills, to leeward of  the storm.    The second ride was much longer, and if possible a more disagreeable  one. It began just in the same way; we were again decoyed out by  sunshine and soft air for a ride round the run, starting about half-past  ten. The scenery was beautiful, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The track lay along our own boundary fence most of the way, and we had  ridden about ten miles, when we stopped at one of our shepherds' huts,  technically called an out station, and accepted his offer of luncheon.  He gave us capital tea, with an egg beaten up in it as a substitute  for milk, cold mutton, bread, and a cake; the reason of these unwonted  luxuries was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],[0,"Prester John (#11)"],[1," reasons, shortly, were these: There were  five or six of them to every white man; they were all, roughly  speaking, of the same stock, with the same tribal beliefs; they had  only just ceased being a warrior race, with a powerful military  discipline; and, most important, they lived round the rim of the  high-veld plateau, and if they combined could cut off the white man  from the sea.  I pointed out to him that it would only be a matter of  time before we opened the road again.  'Ay,' he said, 'but think of  what would happen before then.  Think of the lonely farms and the  little dorps wiped out of the map.  It would be a second and bloodier  Indian mutiny. 'I'm not saying it's likely,' he went on, 'but I  maintain it's possible.  Supposing a second Tchaka turned up, who could  get the different tribes to work together.  It wouldn't be so very hard  to smuggle in arms.  Think of the long, unwatched coast in Gazaland and  Tongaland.  If they got a leader with prestige enough to organize a  crusade against the white man, I don't see what could prevent a rising.'    'We should get wind of it in time to crush it at the start,' I said.    'I'm not so sure.  They are cunning fellows, and have arts that we know  nothing about.  You have heard of native telepathy.  They can send news  over a thousand miles as quick as the telegraph, and we have no means  of tapping the wires. If they ever combined they could keep it as  secret as the grave. My houseboy might be in the rising, and I would  never suspect it till one fine morning he cut my throat.'    'But they would never find a leader.  If there was some exiled prince  of Tchaka's blood, who came back like Prince Charlie to free his  people, there might be danger; but their royalties are fat men with top  hats and old frock-coats, who live in dirty locations.'    Wardlaw admitted this, but said that there might be other kinds of  leaders.  He had been reading a lot about Ethiopianism, which educated  American negroes had been trying to preach in South Africa.  He did not  see why a kind of bastard Christianity should not be the motive of a  rising.  'The Kaffir finds it an easy job to mix up Christian emotion  and pagan practice.  Look at Hayti and some of the performances in the  Southern States.'    Then he shook the ashes out of his pipe and leaned forward with a  solemn face.  'I'll admit the truth to you, Davie.  I'm black afraid.'    He looked so earnest and serious sitting there with his short-sighted  eyes peering at me that I could not help being impressed.    'Whatever is the matter?' I asked.  'Has anything happened?'    He shook his head.  'Nothing I can put a name to.  But I have a  presentiment that some mischief is afoot in these hills.  I feel it in  my bones.'    I confess I was startled by these words.  You must remember that I had  never given a hint of my suspicions to Mr Wardlaw beyond asking him if  a wizard lived in the neighbourhood--a question anybody might have put.  But here was the schoolmaster discovering for himself some mystery in  Blaauwildebeestefontein.    I tried to get at his evidence, but it was very little.  He thought  there were an awful lot of blacks about.  'The woods are full of them,'  he said.  I gathered he did not imagine he was being spied on, but  merely felt that there were more natives about than could be explained.  'There's another thing,' he said.  'The native bairns have all left the  school.  I've only three scholars left, and they are from Dutch farms.  I went to Majinje to find out what was up, and an old crone told me the  place was full of bad men.  I tell you, Davie, there's something  brewing, and that something is not good for us.'    There was nothing new to me in what Wardlaw had to tell, and yet that  talk late at night by a dying fire made me feel afraid for the second  time since I had come to Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I had a clue and had  been on the look-out for mysteries, but that another should feel the  strangeness for himself made it seem desperately real to me.  Of course  I scoffed at Mr Wardlaw's fears.  I could not have him spoiling all my  plans by crying up a native rising for which he had not a scrap of  evidence.    'Have you been writing to anybody?' I asked him.    He said that he had told no one, but he meant to, unless things got  better.  'I haven't the nerve for this job, Davie,' he said; 'I'll have  to resign.  And it's a pity, for the place suits my health fine.  You  see I know too much, and I haven't your whinstone nerve and total lack  of imagination.'    I told him that it was simply fancy, and came from reading too many  books and taking too little exercise.  But I made him promise to say  nothing to anybody either by word of mouth or letter, without telling  me first.  Then I made him a rummer of toddy and sent him to bed a  trifle comforted.    The first thing I did in my new room was to shift the bed into the  corner out of line with the window.  There were no shutters, so I put  up an old table-top and jammed it between the window frames.  Also, I  loaded my shot-gun and kept it by my bedside.  Had Wardlaw seen these  preparations he might have thought more of my imagination and less of  my nerve.  It was a real comfort to me to put out a hand in the  darkness and feel Colin's shaggy coat.        CHAPTER VI    THE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET    Japp was drunk for the next day or two, and I had the business of the  store to myself.  I was glad of this, for it gave me leisure to reflect  upon the various perplexities of my situation.  As I have said, I was  really scared, more out of a sense of impotence than from dread of  actual danger.  I was in a fog of uncertainty. Things were happening  around me which I could only dimly guess at, and I had no power to take  one step in defence.  That Wardlaw should have felt the same without  any hint from me was the final proof that the mystery was no figment of  my nerves.  I had written to Colles and got no answer.  Now the letter  with Japp's resignation in it had gone to Durban.  Surely some notice  would be taken of that.  If I was given the post, Colles was bound to  consider what I had said in my earlier letter and give me some  directions.  Meanwhile it was my business to stick to my job till I was  relieved.    A change had come over the place during my absence.  The natives had  almost disappeared from sight.  Except the few families living round  Blaauwildebeestefontein one never saw a native on the roads, and none  came into the store.  They were sticking close to their locations, or  else they had gone after some distant business.  Except a batch of  three Shangaans returning from the Rand, I had nobody in the store for  the whole of one day.  So about four o'clock I shut it up, whistled on  Colin, and went for a walk along the Berg.    If there were no natives on the road, there were plenty in the bush.  I  had the impression, of which Wardlaw had spoken, that the native  population of the countryside had suddenly been hugely increased.  The  woods were simply _hotching_ with them.  I was being spied on as before,  but now there were so many at the business that they could not all  conceal their tracks.  Every now and then I had a glimpse of a black  shoulder or leg, and Colin, whom I kept on the leash, was half-mad with  excitement.  I had seen all I wanted, and went home with a preoccupied  mind.  I sat long on Wardlaw's garden-seat, trying to puzzle out the  truth of this spying.    What perplexed me was that I had been left unmolested when I had gone  to Umvelos'.  Now, as I conjectured, the secret of the neighbourhood,  whatever it was, was probably connected with the Rooirand.  But when I  had ridden in that direction and had spent two days in exploring, no  one had troubled to watch me.  I was quite certain about this, for my  eye had grown quick to note espionage, and it is harder for a spy to  hide in the spare bush of the flats than in the dense thickets on these  uplands.    The watchers, then, did not mind my fossicking round their sacred  place.  Why, then, was I so closely watched in the harmless  neighbourhood of the store?  I thought for a long time before an answer  occurred to me.  The reason must be that going to the plains I was  going into native country and away from civilization.  But  Blaauwildebeestefontein was near the frontier.  There must be some dark  business brewing of which they may have feared that I had an inkling.  They wanted to see if I proposed to go to Pietersdorp or Wesselsburg  and tell what I knew, and they clearly were resolved that I should not.  I laughed, I remember, thinking that they had forgotten the post-bag.  But then I reflected that I knew nothing of what might be happening  daily to the post-bag.    When I had reached this conclusion, my first impulse was to test it by  riding straight west on the main road.  If I was right, I should  certainly be stopped.  On second thoughts, however, this seemed to me  to be flinging up the game prematurely, and I resolved to wait a day or  two before acting.    Next day nothing happened, save that my sense of loneliness increased.  I felt that I was being hemmed in by barbarism, and cut off in a  ghoulish land from the succour of my own kind.  I only kept my courage  up by the necessity of presenting a brave face to Mr Wardlaw, who was  by this time in a very broken condition of nerves.  I had often thought  that it was my duty to advise him to leave, and to see him safely off,  but I shrank from severing myself from my only friend.  I thought, too,  of the few Dutch farmers within riding distance, and had half a mind to  visit them, but they were far off over the plateau and could know  little of my anxieties.    The third day events moved faster.  Japp was sober and wonderfully  quiet.  He gave me good-morning quite in a friendly tone, and set to  posting up the books as if he had never misbehaved in his days.  I was  so busy"]]]
