[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6841"],[0,"Mosaics of Grecian History (#11)"],[1,"BLACKIE,  in his Legend of Prometheus; represents him as proclaiming, in the  following language, his empire on the earth, in opposition to the  powers above:      \"Jove rules above: Fate willed it so.    'Tis well; Prometheus rules below.    Their gusty games let wild winds play,    And clouds on clouds in thick array    Muster dark armies in the sky:    Be mine a harsher trade to ply--    This solid Earth, this rocky frame    To mould, to conquer, and to tame--    And to achieve the toilsome plan        My workman shall be MAN.      \"The Earth is young. Even with these eyes    I saw the molten mountains rise    From out the seething deep, while Earth    Shook at the portent of their birth.    I saw from out the primal mud    The reptiles crawl, of dull, cold blood,    While winged lizards, with broad stare,    Peered through the raw and misty air.    Where then was Cretan Jove? Where then        This king of gods and men?      \"When, naked from his mother Earth,    Weak and defenceless, man crept forth,    And on mis-tempered solitude    Of unploughed field and unclipped wood    Gazed rudely; when; with brutes, he fed    On acorns, and his stony bed    In dark, unwholesome caverns found,    No skill was then to tame the ground,    No help came then from him above--        This tyrannous, blustering Jove.      \"The Earth is young. Her latest birth,    This weakling man, my craft shall girth    With cunning strength. Him I will take,    And in stern arts my scholar make.    This smoking reed, in which hold    The empyrean spark, shall mould    Rock and hard steel to use of man:    He shall be as a god to plan    And forge all things to his desire        By alchemy of fire.      \"These jagged cliffs that flout the air,    Harsh granite rocks, so rudely bare,    Wise Vulcan's art and mine shall own    To piles of shapeliest beauty grown.    The steam that snorts vain strength away    Shall serve the workman's curious sway,    Like a wise child; as clouds that sail    White-winged before the summer gale,    The smoking chariot o'er the land        Shall roll at his command.      \"'Blow, winds, and crack your checks!' my home    Stands firm beneath Jove's rattling dome,    This stable Earth. Here let me work!    The busy spirits that eager lurk    Within a thousand laboring breasts    Here let me rouse; and whoso rests    From labor, let him rest from life.    To 'live's to strive;' and in the strife    To move the rock and stir the clod        Man makes himself a god!\"      THE PUNISHMENT OF PROMETHEUS.    Regarding the punishment of Prometheus for his daring act, the  legend states that Jupiter bound him with chains to a rock or  pillar, supposed to be in Scythia, and sent an eagle to prey  without ceasing on his liver, which grew every night as much as  it had lost during the day. After an interval of thirty thousand  years Hercules, a hero of great strength and courage, slew the  eagle and set the sufferer free. The Greek poet AES'CHYLUS, justly  styled the father of Grecian tragedy, has made the punishment of  Prometheus the basis of a drama, entitled Prometheus Bound, which  many think is this poet's masterpiece, and of which it has been  remarked:    \"Nothing can be grander than the scenery in which the poet has  made his hero suffer. He is chained to a desolate and stupendous  rock at the extremity of earth's remotest wilds, frowning over  old ocean. The daughters of O-ce'a-nus, who constitute the chorus  of the tragedy, come to comfort and calm him; and even the aged  Oceanus himself, and afterward Mercury, do all they can to persuade  him to submit to his oppressor, Jupiter. But all to no purpose;  he sternly and triumphantly refuses. Meanwhile, the tempest rages,  the lightnings flash upon the rock, the sands are torn up by  whirlwinds, the seas are dashed against the sky, and all the  artillery of heaven is leveled against his bosom, while he proudly  defies the vengeance of his tyrant, and sinks into the earth to  the lower regions, calling on the Powers of Justice to avenge his  wrongs.\"    In trying to persuade the defiant Prometheus to relent, AEschylus  represents Mercury as thus addressing him:      \"I have indeed, methinks, said much in vain,    For still thy heart, beneath my showers of prayers,    Lies dry and hard! nay, leaps like a young horse    Who bites against the new bit in his teeth,    And tugs and struggles against the new-tried rein,    Still fiercest in the weakest thing of all,    Which sophism is--for absolute will alone,    When left to its motions in perverted minds,    Is worse than null for strength! Behold and see,    Unless my words persuade thee, what a blast    And whirlwind of inevitable woe    Must sweep persuasion through thee! For at first    The Father will split up this jut of rock    With the great thunder and the bolted flame,    And hide thy body where the hinge of stone    Shall catch it like an arm! and when thou hast passed    A long black time within, thou shalt come out    To front the sun; and Zeus's winged hound,    The strong, carnivorous eagle, shall wheel down    To meet thee--self-called to a daily feast--    And set his fierce beak in thee, and tear off    The long rags of thy flesh, and batten deep    Upon thy dusky liver!                                \"Do not look    For any end, moreover, to this curse,    Or ere some god appear to bear thy pangs    On his own head vicarious, and descend    With unreluctant step the darks of hell,    And the deep glooms enringing Tartarus!    Then ponder this: the threat is not growth    Of vain invention--it is spoken and meant!    For Zeus's mouth is impotent to lie,    And doth complete the utterance in the act.    So, look to it, thou! take heed! and nevermore    Forget good counsel to indulge self-will!    To which Prometheus answers as follows:      \"Unto me, the foreknower, this mandate of power,        He cries, to reveal it!    And scarce strange is my fate, if I suffer from hate        At the hour that I feel it!    Let the rocks of the lightning, all bristling and whitening,        Flash, coiling me round!    While the ether goes surging 'neath thunder and scourging        Of wild winds unbound!    Let the blast of the firmament whirl from its place        The earth rooted below--    And the brine of the ocean, in rapid emotion,        Be it driven in the face    Of the stars up in heaven, as they walk to and fro!    Let him hurl me anon into Tartarus--on--        To the blackest degree,    With necessity's vortices strangling me down!    But he cannot join death to a fate meant for me!\"      --Trans. by ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.      THE SUFFERINGS OF PROMETHEUS.    We close this subject with a brief extract from the Prometheus  Bound of the English poet SHELLEY, in which the sufferings of  the defiant captive are vividly portrayed:      \"No change, no pause, no hope! yet I endure.    I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt?    I ask yon Heaven, the all-beholding Sun,    Has it not seen? The Sea, in storm or calm,    Heaven's ever-changing shadow, spread below,    Have its deaf waves not heard my agony?    Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, forever!      The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears    Of their moon-freezing crystals; the bright chains    Eat with their burning gold into my bones.    Heaven's winged hound, polluting from thy lips    His beak in poison not his own, tears up    My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by--    The ghastly people of the realm of dream    Mocking me; and the Earthquake fiends are charged    To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds    When the rocks split and close again behind;    While from their loud abysses howling throng    The genii of the storm.\"    Returning now to the poet Ovid, we present the account which he  gives of the Deluge, or the destruction of mankind by a flood,  called by the Greeks,      THE DELUGE OF DEUCALION.    Deucalion is represented as the son of Prometheus, and is styled  the father of the Greek nation of post-diluvian times. When Jupiter  determined to destroy the human race on account of its impiety,  it was his first design, OVID tells us, to accomplish it with fire.  But his own safety demanded the employment of a less dangerous  agency.      Already had Jove tossed the flaming brand,    And rolled the thunder in his spacious hand,    Preparing to discharge on seas and land;    But stopped, for fear, thus violently driven,    The sparks should catch his axle-tree of heaven--    Remembering, in the Fates, a time when fire    Should to the battlements of heaven aspire,    And all his blazing worlds above should burn,    And all the inferior globe to cinders turn.    His dire artillery thus dismissed, he bent    His thoughts to some securer punishment;    Concludes to pour a watery deluge down,    And what he durst not burn resolves to drown.    In all this myth, it will be seen, Jupiter may very properly be  considered as a personification of the elemental strife that  drowned a guilty world. Deucalion, warned, by his father, of the  coming deluge, thereupon made himself an ark or skiff, and, putting  provisions into it, entered it with his wife, Pyrrha. The whole  earth is then overspread with the flood of waters, and all animal  life perishes, except Deucalion and his wife.      The northern breath that freezes floods, Jove binds,    With all the race of cloud-dispelling winds:    The south he loosed, who night and horror brings,    And fogs are shaken from his flaggy wings.    From his divided beard two streams he pours;    His head and rheumy eyes distil in showers.    The skies, from pole to pole, with peals resound;    And showers enlarged come pouring on the ground.      Nor from his patrimonial heaven alone    Is Jove content to pour his vengeance down:    Aid from his brother of the seas he craves,    To help him with auxiliary waves.    The watery tyrant calls his brooks and floods,    Who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6852"],[0,"Venus in Furs (#11)"],[1,"a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be  faithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved  as a hetaira?\"    \"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved  woman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"    \"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.    \"For me, too.\"    \"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.    \"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"  I replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic  greatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall  make happy whoever pleases me.\"    Wanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what  man exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:  this serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be  strong enough to bear it?\"    \"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel  how little I really mean to you.\"    \"But Severin--\"    \"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"    \"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed  it?\"    \"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,  without a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,  and which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink  life at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the  serene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put  on and take off your shoes.\"    \"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as  my slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom  of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It  must give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before  one and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"    \"Am I not your slave?\"    \"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want  to be yours, as long as I love you.\"    \"A month?\"    \"Perhaps, even two.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Then you become my slave.\"    \"And you?\"    \"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my  Olympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.    \"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both  hands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never  can become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her  entire being; I have never seen her like that.    \"Why unachievable?\" I began.    \"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"    \"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,  to Turkey,\" I said eagerly.    \"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes  burned.    \"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I  want your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to  be in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from  you. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent  upon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then  what happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the  slave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt  down, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.    \"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you  really love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered  me with kisses.    \"You really want it?\"    \"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,  wherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I  exclaimed, hardly master of myself.    \"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.    \"Please do!\"    \"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from  anything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love  with all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and  caprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"    She looked strangely at me.    \"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she  continued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but  you have sworn.\"    \"And I shall keep my oath.\"    \"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,  and, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become  my slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I  see I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while  ago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she  tries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.    She has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of  honor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.    With her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,  incredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates  with a kiss.    \"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,  teasing her.    \"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my  lover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations  towards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure  benevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay  claim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,  that you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.  You will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever  I want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you  understand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold  shiver ran through me.    \"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.    \"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid  already, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have  sworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"    \"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,  that you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never  give me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"    \"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and  with tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man  who loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"  She halted.    \"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear  anything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly  thought.\"    Wanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to  reflect.    \"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the  most important thing!\"    \"A condition?\"    \"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I  promise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic  feeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"    \"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.    \"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the  actual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"    \"In Constantinople?\"    \"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be  in owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to  _have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine  world, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on  account of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property  rights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go  to a country where we are not known and where you can appear before  the world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to  Rome or Naples.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her  hair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung  to my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood  began to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.    \"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed  suddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think  clearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your  mercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to  your power.\"    While saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her  feet looking up at her with drunken eyes.    \"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken  in ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look  would be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You  have the eye of a martyr.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Sometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing  myself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.  Suppose she did abuse my passion, her power?    Well, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since  my childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive  terror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play  with me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble  personality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands  --_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this  fear!    Now I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even  in the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored  her.    Love knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers  everything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;  it is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that  make us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.    It is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to  think, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and  ask not whither?           *       *       *       *       *    A Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.
