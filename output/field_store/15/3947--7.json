[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/626"],[0,"The Love of Books: The Philobiblon of Richard de Bury (#11)"],[1," many  laws acquire force by mere custom, not by syllogistic necessity, like  the arts: as Aristotle, the Phoebus of the Schools, urges in the second  book of the Politics, where he confutes the policy of Hippodamus, which  holds out rewards to the inventors of new laws, because to abrogate old  laws and establish new ones is to weaken the force of those which  exist.  For whatever receives its stability from use alone must  necessarily be brought to nought by disuse.    From which it is seen clearly enough, that as laws are neither arts nor  sciences, so books of law cannot properly be called books of art or  science.  Nor is this faculty which we may call by a special term  geologia, or the earthly science, to be properly numbered among the  sciences.  Now the books of the liberal arts are so useful to the  divine writings, that without their aid the intellect would vainly  aspire to understand them.        CHAPTER XII    WHY WE HAVE CAUSED BOOKS OF GRAMMAR TO BE SO DILIGENTLY PREPARED    While we were constantly delighting ourselves with the reading of  books, which it was our custom to read or have read to us every day, we  noticed plainly how much the defective knowledge even of a single word  hinders the understanding, as the meaning of no sentence can be  apprehended, if any part of it be not understood.  Wherefore we ordered  the meanings of foreign words to be noted with particular care, and  studied the orthography, prosody, etymology, and syntax in ancient  grammarians with unrelaxing carefulness, and took pains to elucidate  terms that had grown too obscure by age with suitable explanations, in  order to make a smooth path for our students.    This is the whole reason why we took care to replace the antiquated  volumes of the grammarians by improved codices, that we might make  royal roads, by which our scholars in time to come might attain without  stumbling to any science.        CHAPTER XIII    WHY WE HAVE NOT WHOLLY NEGLECTED THE FABLES OF THE POETS    All the varieties of attack directed against the poets by the lovers of  naked truth may be repelled by a two-fold defence: either that even in  an unseemly subject-matter we may learn a charming fashion of speech,  or that where a fictitious but becoming subject is handled, natural or  historical truth is pursued under the guise of allegorical fiction.    Although it is true that all men naturally desire knowledge, yet they  do not all take the same pleasure in learning.  On the contrary, when  they have experienced the labour of study and find their senses  wearied, most men inconsiderately fling away the nut, before they have  broken the shell and reached the kernel.  For man is naturally fond of  two things, namely, freedom from control and some pleasure in his  activity; for which reason no one without reason submits himself to the  control of others, or willingly engages in any tedious task.  For  pleasure crowns activity, as beauty is a crown to youth, as Aristotle  truly asserts in the tenth book of the Ethics.  Accordingly the wisdom  of the ancients devised a remedy by which to entice the wanton minds of  men by a kind of pious fraud, the delicate Minerva secretly lurking  beneath the mask of pleasure.  We are wont to allure children by  rewards, that they may cheerfully learn what we force them to study  even though they are unwilling.  For our fallen nature does not tend to  virtue with the same enthusiasm with which it rushes into vice.  Horace  has expressed this for us in a brief verse of the Ars Poetica, where he  says:      All poets sing to profit or delight.    And he has plainly intimated the same thing in another verse of the  same book, where he says:         He hits the mark, who mingles joy with use.    How many students of Euclid have been repelled by the Pons Asinorum, as  by a lofty and precipitous rock, which no help of ladders could enable  them to scale!  THIS IS A HARD SAYING, they exclaim, AND WHO CAN  RECEIVE IT.  The child of inconstancy, who ended by wishing to be  transformed into an ass, would perhaps never have given up the study of  philosophy, if he had met him in friendly guise veiled under the cloak  of pleasure; but anon, astonished by Crato's chair and struck dumb by  his endless questions, as by a sudden thunderbolt, he saw no refuge but  in flight.    So much we have alleged in defence of the poets; and now we proceed to  show that those who study them with proper intent are not to be  condemned in regard to them.  For our ignorance of one single word  prevents the understanding of a whole long sentence, as was assumed in  the previous chapter.  As now the sayings of the saints frequently  allude to the inventions of the poets, it must needs happen that  through our not knowing the poem referred to, the whole meaning of the  author is completely obscured, and assuredly, as Cassiodorus says in  his book Of the Institutes of Sacred Literature:  Those things are not  to be considered trifles without which great things cannot come to  pass.  It follows therefore that through ignorance of poetry we do not  understand Jerome, Augustine, Boethius, Lactantius, Sidonius, and very  many others, a catalogue of whom would more than fill a long chapter.    The Venerable Bede has very clearly discussed and determined this  doubtful point, as is related by that great compiler Gratian, the  repeater of numerous authors, who is as confused in form as he was  eager in collecting matter for his compilation.  Now he writes in his  37th section:  Some read secular literature for pleasure, taking  delight in the inventions and elegant language of the poets; but others  study this literature for the sake of scholarship, that by their  reading they may learn to detest the errors of the Gentiles and may  devoutly apply what they find useful in them to the use of sacred  learning.  Such men study secular literature in a laudable manner. So  far Bede.    Taking this salutary instruction to heart, let the detractors of those  who study the poets henceforth hold their peace, and let not those who  are ignorant of these things require that others should be as ignorant  as themselves, for this is the consolation of the wretched.  And  therefore let every man see that his own intentions are upright, and he  may thus make of any subject, observing the limitations of virtue, a  study acceptable to God.  And if he have found profit in poetry, as the  great Virgil relates that he had done in Ennius, he will not have done  amiss.        CHAPTER XIV    WHO OUGHT TO BE SPECIAL LOVERS OF BOOKS    To him who recollects what has been said before, it is plain and  evident who ought to be the chief lovers of books.  For those who have  most need of wisdom in order to perform usefully the duties of their  position, they are without doubt most especially bound to show more  abundantly to the sacred vessels of wisdom the anxious affection of a  grateful heart.  Now it is the office of the wise man to order rightly  both himself and others, according to the Phoebus of philosophers,  Aristotle, who deceives not nor is deceived in human things.  Wherefore  princes and prelates, judges and doctors, and all other leaders of the  commonwealth, as more than others they have need of wisdom, so more  than others ought they to show zeal for the vessels of wisdom.    Boethius, indeed, beheld Philosophy bearing a sceptre in her left hand  and books in her right, by which it is evidently shown to all men that  no one can rightly rule a commonwealth without books. Thou, says  Boethius, speaking to Philosophy, hast sanctioned this saying by the  mouth of Plato, that states would be happy if they were ruled by  students of philosophy, or if their rulers would study philosophy.  And  again, we are taught by the very gesture of the figure that in so far  as the right hand is better than the left, so far the contemplative  life is more worthy than the active life; and at the same time we are  shown that the business of the wise man is to devote himself by turns,  now to the study of truth, and now to the dispensation of temporal  things.    We read that Philip thanked the Gods devoutly for having granted that  Alexander should be born in the time of Aristotle, so that educated  under his instruction he might be worthy to rule his father's empire.  While Phaeton unskilled in driving becomes the charioteer of his  father's car, he unhappily distributes to mankind the heat of Phoebus,  now by excessive nearness, and now by withdrawing it too far, and so,  lest all beneath him should be imperilled by the closeness of his  driving, justly deserved to be struck by the thunderbolt.    The history of the Greeks as well as Romans shows that there were no  famous princes among them who were devoid of literature.  The sacred  law of Moses in prescribing to the king a rule of government, enjoins  him to have a copy made of the book of Divine law (Deut. xvii.)  according to the copy shown by the priests, in which he was to read all  the days of his life.  Certes, God Himself, who hath made and who  fashioneth every day the hearts of every one of us, knows the  feebleness of human memory and the instability of virtuous intentions  in mankind.  Wherefore He has willed that books should be as it were an  antidote to all evil, the reading and use of which He has commanded to  be the healthful daily nourishment of the soul, so that by them the  intellect being refreshed and neither weak nor doubtful should never  hesitate in action.  This subject is elegantly handled by John of  Salisbury, in his Policraticon.  In conclusion, all classes of men who  are conspicuous by the tonsure or the sign of clerkship, against whom  books lifted up their voices in the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters,  are bound to serve books with perpetual veneration.        CHAPTER XV    OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE LOVE OF BOOKS    It transcends the power of human intellect, however deeply it may have  drunk of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6260"],[0,"Donovan Pasha, and Some People of Egypt — Complete (#11)"],[1,"ords; and for a moment he found it hard to speak. He was  about to say something, however, when Fielding continued.    \"Norman there,\"--he pointed to the deck-cabin, \"Norman's the same.  He says it's do or die; and he looks it. It isn't like a few fellows  besieged by a host. For in that case you wait to die, and you fight to  the last, and you only have your own lives. But this is different. We're  fighting to save these people from themselves; and this slow, quiet,  deadly work, day in, day out, in the sickening sun and smell-faugh! the  awful smell in the air--it kills in the end, if you don't pull your game  off. You know it's true.\"    His eyes had an eager, almost prayerful look; he was like a child in  his simple earnestness. His fingers moved over the maps on the table,  in which were little red and white and yellow flags, the white flags to  mark the towns and villages where they had mastered the disease, the red  flags to mark the new ones attacked, the yellow to indicate those where  the disease was raging. His fingers touched one of the flags, and he  looked down.    \"See, D. Here are two new places attacked to-day.    \"I must ride over to Abdallah when Norman goes. It's all so hopeless!\"    \"Things will take a turn,\" rejoined Dicky, with a forced gaiety. \"You  needn't ride over to Abdallah. I'll go with Norman, and what's more I'll  come back here with Mustapha Kali.\"    \"You'll go to the Mudir?\" asked Fielding eagerly. He seemed to set so  much store by this particular business.    \"I'll bring the Mudir too, if there's any trouble,\" said Dicky grimly;  though it is possible he did not mean what he said.    Two hours later Fielding, Dicky, and Norman were in conference,  extending their plans of campaign. Fielding and Norman were eager and  nervous, and their hands and faces seemed to have taken on the arid  nature of the desert. Before they sat down Dicky had put the bottle of  whiskey out of easy reach; for Fielding, under ordinary circumstances  the most abstemious of men, had lately, in his great fatigue and  overstrain, unconsciously emptied his glass more often than was wise for  a campaign of long endurance. Dicky noticed now, as they sat round the  table, that Norman's hand went to the coffee-pot as Fielding's had gone  to his glass. What struck him as odd also was that Fielding seemed to  have caught something of Norman's manner. There was the same fever in  the eyes, though Norman's face was more worn and the eyes more sunken.  He looked like a man that was haunted. There was, too, a certain air of  helplessness about him, a primitive intensity almost painful. Dicky saw  Fielding respond to this in a curious way--it was the kind of fever that  passes quickly from brain to brain when there is not sound bodily health  commanded by a cool intelligence to insulate it. Fielding had done the  work of four men for over two months, and, like most large men, his  nerves had given in before Dicky's, who had done six men's work  at least, and, by his power of organisation and his labour-saving  intelligence, conserved the work of another fifty.    The three were sitting silent, having arranged certain measures, when  Norman sprang to his feet excitedly and struck the table with his hand.    \"It's no use, sir,\" he said to Fielding, \"I'll have to go. I'm no good.  I neglect my duty. I was to be back at Abdallah at five. I forgot  all about it. A most important thing. A load of fessikh was landed at  Minkari, five miles beyond Abdallah. We've prohibited fessikh. I was  going to seize it. ... It's no good. It's all so hopeless here.\"    Dicky knew now that the beginning of the end had come for Norman. There  were only two things to do: get him away shooting somewhere, or humour  him here. But there was no chance for shooting till things got very  much better. The authorities in Cairo would never understand, and  the babbling social-military folk would say that they had calmly gone  shooting while pretending to stay the cholera epidemic. It wouldn't be  possible to explain that Norman was in a bad way, and that it was done  to give him half a chance of life.    Fielding also ought to have a few days clear away from this constant  pressure and fighting, and the sounds and the smells of death; but it  could not be yet. Therefore, to humour them both was the only thing,  and Norman's was the worse case. After all, they had got a system of  sanitary supervision, they had the disease by the throat, and even in  Cairo the administration was waking up a little. The crisis would soon  pass perhaps, if a riot could be stayed and the natives give up their  awful fictions of yellow handkerchiefs, poisoned sweetmeats, deadly  limewash, and all such nonsense.    So Dicky said now, \"All right, Norman; come along. You'll seize that  fessikh, and I'll bring back Mustapha Kali. We'll work him as he has  never worked in his life. He'll be a living object-lesson. We'll have  all Upper Egypt on the banks of the Nile waiting to see what happens to  Mustapha.\"    Dicky laughed, and Fielding responded feebly; but Norman was looking at  the hospital with a look too bright for joy, too intense for despair.    \"I found ten in a corner of a cane-field yesterday,\" he said dreamily.  \"Four were dead, and the others had taken the dead men's smocks as  covering.\" He shuddered. \"I see nothing but limewash, smell nothing but  carbolic. It's got into my head. Look here, old man, I can't stand it.  I'm no use,\" he added pathetically to Fielding.    \"You're right enough, if you'll not take yourself so seriously,\" said  Dicky jauntily. \"You mustn't try to say, 'Alone I did it.' Come along.  Fill your tobacco-pouch. There are the horses. I'm ready.\"    He turned to Fielding.    \"It's going to be a stiff ride, Fielding. But I'll do it in twenty-four  hours, and bring Mustapha Kali too--for a consideration.\"    He paused, and Fielding said, with an attempt at playfulness: \"Name your  price.\"    \"That you play for me, when I get back, the overture of 'Tannhauser'.  Play it, mind; no tuning-up sort of thing, like last Sunday's  performance. Practise it, my son! Is it a bargain? I'm not going to work  for nothing a day.\"    He watched the effect of his words anxiously, for he saw how needful  it was to divert Fielding's mind in the midst of all this \"plague,  pestilence, and famine.\" For days Fielding had not touched the piano,  the piano which Mrs. Henshaw, widow of Henshaw of the Buffs, had  insisted on his taking with him a year before, saying that it would be a  cure for loneliness when away from her. During the first of these black  days Fielding had played intermittently for a few moments at a time, and  Dicky had noticed that after playing he seemed in better spirits. But  lately the disease of a ceaseless unrest, of constant sleepless work,  was on him. He had not played for near a week, saying, in response to  Dicky's urging, that there was no time for music. And Dicky knew that  presently there would be no time to eat, and then no time to sleep; and  then, the worst!    Dicky had pinned his faith and his friendship to Fielding, and he saw no  reason why he should lose his friend because Madame Cholera was stalking  the native villages, driving the fellaheen before her like sheep to the  slaughter.    \"Is it a bargain?\" he added, as Fielding did not at once reply. If  Fielding would but play it would take the strain off his mind at times.    \"All right, D., I'll see what I can do with it,\" said Fielding, and with  a nod turned to the map with the little red and white and yellow flags,  and began to study it.    He did not notice that one of his crew abaft near the wheel was watching  him closely, while creeping along the railing on the pretence of  cleaning it. Fielding was absorbed in making notes upon a piece of paper  and moving the little flags about. Now he lit a cigar and began walking  up and down the deck.    The Arab disappeared, but a few minutes afterwards returned. The deck  was empty. Fielding had ridden away to the village. The map was still on  the table. With a frightened face the Arab peered at it, then going to  the side he called down softly, and there came up from the lower deck a  Copt, the sarraf of the village, who could read English fairly. The Arab  pointed to the map, and the Copt approached cautiously. A few feet away  he tried to read what was on the map, but, unable to do so, drew closer,  pale-faced and knockkneed, and stared at the map and the little flags.  An instant after he drew back, and turned to the Arab. \"May God burn  his eyes! He sends the death to the village by moving the flags. May God  change him into a dog to be beaten to death! The red is to begin, the  white flag is for more death, the yellow is for enough. See--may God cut  off his hand!--he has moved the white flag to our village.\" He pointed  in a trembling fear, half real, half assumed--for he was of a nation of  liars.    During the next half-hour at least a dozen Arabs came to look at the  map, but they disappeared like rats in a hole when, near midnight,  Fielding's tall form appeared on the bank above.    It was counted to him as a devil's incantation, the music that he played  that night, remembering his promise to Dicky Donovan. It was music  through which breathed the desperate, troubled, aching heart and  tortured mind of an overworked strong man. It cried to the night its  trouble; but far over in the Cholera Hospital the sick heard it and  turned their faces towards it eagerly. It pierced the apathy of the  dying. It did more, for it gave Fielding five hours' sleep that night;  and though he waked to see one of his own crew dead on the bank, he  tackled the day's labour with more hope than he had had for a fortnight.    As the day wore on, however, his spirits fell, for on every hand was  suspicion, unrest, and opposition, and his native assistants went  sluggishly about their work. It was pathetic and disheartening to see  "]]]
