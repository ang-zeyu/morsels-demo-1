When all were filled, the thread was wound off in knots and skeins on a  reel. A machine called a clock-reel counted the exact number of strands  in a knot, usually forty, and ticked when the requisite number had been  wound. Then the spinner would stop and tie the knot. A quaint old ballad  has the refrain:--        \"And he kissed Mistress Polly when the clock-reel ticked.\"    That is, the lover seized the rare and propitious moments of Mistress  Polly's comparative leisure to kiss her.    Usually the knots or lays were of forty threads, and twenty lays made a  skein or slipping. The number varied, however, with locality. To spin  two skeins of linen thread was a good day's work; for it a spinner was  paid eight cents a day and \"her keep.\"    These skeins of thread had to be bleached. They were laid in warm water  for four days, the water being frequently changed, and the skeins  constantly wrung out. Then they were washed in the brook till the water  came from them clear and pure. Then they were \"bucked,\" that is,  bleached with ashes and hot water, in a bucking-tub, over and over  again, then laid in clear water for a week, and afterwards came a grand  seething, rinsing, beating, washing, drying, and winding on bobbins for  the loom. Sometimes the bleaching was done with slaked lime or with  buttermilk.    These were not the only bleaching operations the flax went through;  others will be detailed in the chapter on hand-weaving.    One lucrative product of flax should be mentioned--flaxseed. Flax was  pulled for spinning when the base of the stalk began to turn yellow,  which was usually the first of July. An old saying was, \"June brings the  flax.\" For seed it stood till it was all yellow. The flaxseed was used  for making oil. Usually the upper chambers of country stores were filled  a foot deep with flaxseed in the autumn, waiting for good sleighing to  convey the seed to town.    In New Hampshire in early days, a wheelwright was not a man who made  wagon-wheels (as such he would have had scant occupation), but one who  made spinning-wheels. Often he carried them around the country on  horseback selling them, thus adding another to the many interesting  itineracies of colonial days. Spinning-wheels would seem clumsy for  horse-carriage, but they were not set up, and several could be compactly  carried when taken apart; far more ticklish articles went on  pack-horses,--large barrels, glazed window-sashes, etc. Nor would it  seem very difficult for a man to carry spinning-wheels on horseback,  when frequently a woman would jump on horseback in the early morning,  and with a baby on one arm and a flax-wheel tied behind, would ride  several miles to a neighbor's to spend the day spinning in cheerful  companionship. A century ago one of these wheelwrights sold a fine  spinning-wheel for a dollar, a clock-reel for two dollars, and a  wool-wheel for two dollars.    Few persons are now living who have ever seen carried on in a country  home in America any of these old-time processes which have been  recounted. As an old antiquary wrote:--         \"Few have ever seen a woman hatchel flax or card tow, or heard the       buzzing of the foot-wheel, or seen bunches of flaxen yarn hanging       in the kitchen, or linen cloth whitening on the grass. The       flax-dresser with the shives, fibres, and dirt of flax covering his       garments, and his face begrimed with flax-dirt has disappeared; the       noise of his brake and swingling knife has ended, and the boys no       longer make bonfires of his swingling tow. The sound of the       spinning-wheel, the song of the spinster, and the snapping of the       clock-reel all have ceased; the warping bars and quill wheel are       gone, and the thwack of the loom is heard only in the factory. The       spinning woman of King Lemuel cannot be found.\"    Frequent references are made to flax in the Bible, notably in the Book  of Proverbs; and the methods of growing and preparing flax by the  ancient Egyptians were precisely the same as those of the American  colonist a hundred years ago, of the Finn, Lapp, Norwegian, and Belgian  flax-growers to-day. This ancient skill was not confined to  flax-working. Rosselini, the eminent hierologist, says that every modern  craftsman may see on Egyptian monuments four thousand years old,  representations of the process of his craft just as it is carried on  to-day. The paintings in the Grotto of El Kab, shown in Hamilton's  _AEgyptica_, show the pulling, stocking, tying, and rippling of flax  going on just as it is done in Egypt now. The four-tooth ripple of the  Egyptian is improved upon, but it is the same implement. Pliny gives an  account of the mode of preparing flax: plucking it up by the roots,  tying it in bundles, drying, watering, beating, and hackling it, or, as  he says, \"combing it with iron hooks.\" Until the Christian era linen was  almost the only kind of clothing used in Egypt, and the teeming banks of  the Nile furnished flax in abundance. The quality of the linen can be  seen in the bands preserved on mummies. It was not, however, spun on a  wheel, but on a hand-distaff, called sometimes a rock, on which the  women in India still spin the very fine thread which is employed in  making India muslins. The distaff was used in our colonies; it was  ordered that children and others tending sheep or cattle in the fields  should also \"be set to some other employment withal, such as spinning  upon the rock, knitting, weaving tape, etc.\" I heard recently a  distinguished historian refer in a lecture to this colonial statute, and  he spoke of the children _sitting upon a rock_ while knitting or  spinning, etc., evidently knowing naught of the proper signification of  the word.    The homespun industries have ever been held to have a beneficent and  peace-bringing influence on women. Wordsworth voiced this sentiment when  he wrote his series of sonnets beginning:--        \"Grief! thou hast lost an ever-ready friend      Now that the cottage spinning-wheel is mute.\"    Chaucer more cynically says, through the _Wife of Bath_:--        \"Deceite, weepynge, spynnynge God hath give      To wymmen kyndely that they may live.\"    Spinning doubtless was an ever-ready refuge in the monotonous life of  the early colonist. She soon had plenty of material to work with.  Everywhere, even in the earliest days, the culture of flax was  encouraged. By 1640 the Court of Massachusetts passed two orders  directing the growth of flax, ascertaining what colonists were skilful  in breaking, spinning, weaving, ordering that boys and girls be taught  to spin, and offering a bounty for linen grown, spun, and woven in the  colony. Connecticut passed similar measures. Soon spinning-classes were  formed, and every family ordered to spin so many pounds of flax a year,  or to pay a fine. The industry received a fresh impulse through the  immigration of about one hundred Irish families from Londonderry. They  settled in New Hampshire on the Merrimac about 1719, and spun and wove  with far more skill than prevailed among those English settlers who had  already become Americans. They established a manufactory according to  Irish methods, and attempts at a similar establishment were made in  Boston.    There was much public excitement over spinning, and prizes were offered  for quantity and quality. Women, rich as well as poor, appeared on  Boston Common with their wheels, thus making spinning a popular holiday  recreation. A brick building was erected as a spinning-school costing  L15,000, and a tax was placed on carriages and coaches in 1757 to  support it. At the fourth anniversary in 1749 of the \"Boston Society for  promoting Industry and Frugality,\" three hundred \"young spinsters\" spun  on their wheels on Boston Common. And a pretty sight it must have been:  the fair young girls in the quaint and pretty dress of the times, shown  to us in Hogarth's prints, spinning on the green grass under the great  trees. In 1754, on a like occasion, a minister preached to the  \"spinsters,\" and a collection of L453 was taken up. This was in currency  of depreciated value. At the same time premiums were offered in  Pennsylvania for weaving linen and spinning thread. Benjamin Franklin  wrote in his _Poor Richard's Almanac_:--        \"Many estates are spent in the getting,      Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting.\"    But the German colonists long before this had been famous flax-raisers.  A Pennsylvania poet in 1692 descanted on the flax-workers of  Germantown:--        \"Where live High German people and Low Dutch      Whose trade in weaving linen cloth is much,      There grows the flax as also you may know,      That from the same they do divide the tow.\"    Father Pastorius, their leader, forever commemorated his interest in his  colony and in the textile arts by his choice for a device for a seal.  Whittier thus describes it in his _Pennsylvania Pilgrim_:--        \"Still on the town-seal his device is found,      Grapes, flax, and thread-spool on a three-foil ground      With _Vinum, Linum, et Textrinum_ wound.\"    Virginia was earlier even in awakening interest in manufacturing flax  than Massachusetts, for wild flax grew there in profusion, ready for  gathering. In 1646 two houses were ordered to be erected at Jamestown as  spinning-schools. These were to be well built and well heated. Each  county was to send to these schools two poor children, seven or eight  years old, to be taught carding, spinning, and knitting. Each child was  to be supplied by the county authorities on admission to the school with  six barrels of Indian corn, a pig, two hens, clothing, shoes, a bed,  rug, blanket, two coverlets, a wooden tray, and two pewter dishes or  cups. This plan was not wholly carried out.

Only a display of overwhelming force on our part can hold her  steady and prevent the accession of another 500,000 men to the enemy's  strength.\"    That the publicists who argued thus and who, to give to their argument  greater cogency, generously added to the Greek army some 200,000 men,  were persuaded by their own reasoning, it is hard to believe without  libelling human sense.  Apart from the ocular refutation supplied by  the map, what had Greece to gain by siding with the enemies of the  Entente?  That she would lose all her islands, have her coast towns  pulverized and her population starved, was certain.  What she could get  in return, it needed a very robust imagination to suggest.  The only  countries at whose cost the Hellenic Kingdom could possibly compensate  itself for these inevitable sacrifices were Turkey and Bulgaria; and  those countries were Germany's allies.  A moment's reflection raises a  number of equally unanswerable questions: If the Greeks wanted to join  Germany, why did they not do so when the Kaiser invited them at the  very beginning of the War?  Why did they not resist the landing of the  Allies?  Why did they not attack them when they had them at their  mercy: 60,000 French and British, with the Germans and the Bulgars in  front of them, and 150,000 Greeks between them and Salonica?[8]    {81}    In this connexion the evidence of an eminent English soldier and an  eminent French statesman who visited Athens at that time to study the  situation on the spot may be cited.  To each King Constantine and M.  Skouloudis, in the course of lengthy interviews, declared that the  Allied forces had nothing to fear in Greece.  Each was convinced of  their sincerity, and of the true motives of their attitude: \"They  both,\" reported Lord Kitchener, \"seem very determined to stick to their  neutrality.\"  Likewise General Dousmanis, Chief of the General Staff,  and Colonel Metaxas, who were represented to the Entente publics as  Germanophile pedants, satisfied Lord Kitchener of their genuine concern  about the British sphere in the East, and startled him by pressing upon  him a plan of action \"almost exactly the same as detailed in my  telegrams, and based their conclusions on the same argument almost word  for word.  They emphatically stated that there was no other way of  preventing the accomplishment of the German project.\" [9]  M. Denys  Cochin even went so far as to publish to the whole world that the  suspicions entertained against King Constantine had no other source  than party rancour.[10]    For the rest, a striking proof that the Entente Powers themselves did  not believe the story of the Greek Government's hostile intentions is  afforded by the fact that, instead of demanding, they deprecated the  disbandment of the Greek army.  When Lord Kitchener saw M. Skouloudis,  the latter said that the Allies' mistrust might well force Greece to  consider whether it would not be better for her to demobilize, leaving  to them all responsibility for the consequences.  Lord Kitchener, in  the presence of the British Minister, replied that, \"as to some partial  demobilization, it was for Greece to decide according to her interests,  but he did not think a general demobilization advisable.\"  And again, a  little later on, when {82} M. Skouloudis, irritated by a fresh  exhibition of mistrust, told the French Minister that, in face of such  a state of things, nothing was left for his unhappy country but to  order at once a general demobilization, and let the Entente Powers do  what they liked to her, M. Guillemin cried out, \"Ah, no.  I am  decidedly against demobilization.\"  Naturally: \"the Greek Army,\" said  Sir Thomas Cuninghame, the British Military Attache, to General  Moschopoulos.  Military Governor of Salonica, \"saves and secures the  flanks and rear of the Allies.\" [11]    However, the story served the purpose of supplying a pretext for  pressure.  All ships carrying foodstuffs and other commodities were  held up.  In addition, Milo--an island not far from Athens--was  occupied, and the Allied Fleet was ordered to be ready, in case things  should be pushed to extremes, to open war on Greek commerce, to destroy  the Greek Fleet, and to bombard Athens, _en respectant les monuments  anciens_.[12]    Fortunately, the occasion for extreme measures, by which even the  ancient ruins might have suffered, did not arise.  General Sarrail, who  at first urged that the naval demonstration against Athens should be  proceeded with immediately, on second thoughts, prompted by nervousness  as to the safety of his troops, deprecated such action.  At the same  time, M. Skouloudis, alarmed by the blockade--Greece never has more  than a very limited food reserve--invited the Allies to state their  demands, saying that he would accede to them if it was possible to do  so.[13]    Whereupon the Allies, \"ever animated by the most benevolent intentions  towards Greece, and anxious that the equivocal situation in which  events had placed her towards them should come to an end and their  relations be re-established on a basis of mutual and lasting  confidence,\" demanded first of all a formal assurance that in no  circumstances would the Greek troops attempt to disarm or intern the  retiring Allied troops, but that the policy of benevolent neutrality  promised would be maintained with all its consequences.  They disavowed  any wish or intention to compel the Hellenic Government to {83}  participate in the European War from which it had declared that it  meant to hold aloof.  But it was a vital necessity for them not to let  it in any way hinder the freedom of their movements on land or sea, or  compromise the security of their troops throughout the field of their  operations.  They therefore must be assured that they will obtain,  according to the promise already given by M. Zaimis, all the facilities  which they might require, notably in the port of Salonica and on the  roads and railways.  It was understood that the Entente Powers would  restore in full at the end of the War all the parts of Greek territory  which they might be obliged to occupy during the hostilities, and that  they would duly pay indemnities for all damage caused by the  occupation.[14]    M. Skouloudis, after thanking the Entente Powers for the benevolent  intentions with which they declared themselves to be animated towards  Greece, willingly repeated the assurances he had so many times already  given, that the Greek troops would in no circumstances seek to disarm  or intern the Allied troops, and that the Greek Government in its  relations with the Entente Powers would in everything hold fast to its  policy of benevolent neutrality.  He once more noted the reiterated  disavowal by the Allied Governments of any wish or intention to force  Greece into the War, and on his part disavowed any wish or intention to  hinder in any way the freedom of their movements on land or sea, or to  compromise in any way the security of their troops.  The Hellenic  Government had always kept the promises made by M. Zaimis to the very  utmost of its ability, and had no difficulty in renewing the assurance  that the Allied Governments would continue to receive all the  facilities their troops might require in the port of Salonica, and on  the roads and railways.[15]    These prefatory amenities led on 10 December to a detailed Agreement,  the Greek Government promising to move its troops out of the way and  \"not to oppose by force the construction of defensive works or the  occupation of fortified points,\" but reserving to itself the right to  protest {84} against such operations \"energetically and seriously, not  as a mere form\"--a right which the Allies easily conceded[16]--and  emphatically declaring that \"should the Allied troops by their  movements bring the war into Greek territory, the Greek troops would  withdraw so as to leave the field free to the two parties to settle  their differences.\"    The Entente Ministers expressed their satisfaction, and M. Skouloudis  expressed the hope that their Governments, convinced at last of the  Greek Government's sincerity, would not only drop coercion, but comply  with its request for financial and commercial facilities.  They  promised that all difficulties would disappear as soon as the military  authorities on the spot had given effect to the agreement; and the  French Minister repeated his Government's declaration that it would be  happy to accord Greece all financial and commercial facilities as soon  as the situation cleared.[17]        [1] _Journal Officiel_, pp. 61, 70, 75-8.
