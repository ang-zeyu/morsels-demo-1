'You've got the plan?'    He had given me an elaborate little drawing of two streets that  converged. His bungalow stood upon an island betwixt their  confluence and the shading that he had marked waste ground. The  pink paper was in my breast pocket, but, knowing my way with  papers, I had already learned those streets' names.    'All right,' I said. 'But I'm not likely to go that way. And the  time's so short. I'll try though.'    His face lit, and his eyes gleamed. 'Do try,' he said.    'Don't build on it,' I entreated him. 'I'll try to write to her  anyway.'    Then he looked downcast indeed; he had fallen from such a  confident height. But he said 'Goodbye' like a real friend.    I forgot him almost completely for the next four days or so.  There were excitements, seeing somebody at headquarters, wiring  business wires, writing friendly letters against time, steering a  forlorn small native and a more forlorn small dog, who were  sharing my fortunes, down to the coast. At last I was there, and  discussing shipping news with new-found keenness. My prospects of  getting off with speed looked black for a bit; then came the  flash of a fresh idea. As there was no ship for the African port  I knew, why not book for the unknown? There were transports  returning to a port beyond, I had heard. True, the cost of  railway traveling thence was hard to forecast, resources were of  a modest sort, and there were three of us to find fares for.    Yet ways and means began to show their forms out of the mist  soon. I chose to sail almost at once by the untried road, and I  wrote to friends', telling them how I had chosen. I wrote to my  friend in hospital, among others. I was going the Bulawayo way  after all, and I might do what he wanted quite unbelievably  easily. Who would have thought it when we parted? I scribbled  down the great news against time. (I had an importunate proof to  correct before sailing; proofs are apt to take hours, I find, and  my sailing hour was near.) He might be expected to have my  scribble handed to him on the hospital stoep about three days  after. So I calculated. I flattered myself that I knew the ins  and outs of our despatches and mail deliveries, also that I had  allowed in my calculation for censorial delay. It was pleasant to  think how pleased he might be expected to be. I well-wished him  with a prayer. Then I started down the glaring white road for the  wharf. I had dismissed him from my mind, I regret to say, for  another three days or more.    I traveled down from that east coast fighting-base on a transport  that had brought up mules and horses. She had naturally enough,  shipped a goodly crew of flies with them. The mules and horses  had gone their ways, but the flies had by no means all gone with  them. Now with no quadrupeds to be their prime care, those that  remained were apt to obtrude themselves upon us. I deprecated at  heart the ruthless warfare that marine authority waged upon them.  But for all that I found my afternoon slumbers often distracted  by the survivors. On the first and second afternoons of that  voyage I awoke not long after I dropped off. I awoke, and thought  about nothing in particular. On the third afternoon my waking  thoughts took a very definite shape.    I was in a cabin or stateroom that two officers had shared going  up doubtless of the veterinary profession. Now on this return  journey I had the place to myself. I lay in my bunk with my boots  off, and observed the empty couch beside me.    It was my friend that I thought of my friend as I had taken leave  of him, reclining on the hospital stoep, straining with eager  eyes at mine. It was his breathless voice that I remembered. It  was saying over and over, 'You will go and see her, won't you?  I'll be with you in spirit in this your trek for her and home.'    Surely he was on that couch in the cabin now beside me, and  surely he was saying the same thing over and over again, just as  regularly and restlessly as if he were yonder electric fan  curveting with the same sort of panting iteration.    And yet, don't mistake me, I don't pretend to have seen anything  or heard anything extraordinary in the ordinary way of seeing or  hearing. Only I was dead sure that he was there with the same old  entreaty. Afterwards I lighted a pipe, went above, talked to the  skipper's wife, read, investigated my boy's and also my dog's  welfare rather perfunctorily, settled down to saying an evening  Office, made an end more or less of that, just as night came on,  and then again took time to think over things. I remembered that  he would have possibly got my letter, the letter which announced  my sailing in this ship of the Archangel Line, just about the  very time that he had seemed so near me. It was natural enough,  then, that his eager mind should have embarked with me on the  'Saint Raphael.' He knew now that I was going home, contrary to  previous expectation, by the very way he had desired, the way to  see his wife and tell her his news.    That night, when I said my prayers, I took but a corner of that  couch for my elbows. I gave him room, so to speak, with odd  scrupulous courtesy, just as if he were lying there in the body.  For I knew he was there, there by his own subtle means of  transport. That night the wind rose, and for the next three days  about, we were on the downgrade as regards weather. Our captain  opined that there had been a hurricane of sorts to south-east,  out Madagascar way. We were in the troughs of a mighty swell that  grew in might till the third morn of its reign was over. In the  mad tilting of my cabin floor, and the scuffling of my cabin  accessories, that last morning, the unseen and unheard presence  that I was now growing used to, reclined unperturbed. Elsewhere I  would forget it lightly enough, as soon as ever I left the cabin,  at the saloon table, where plate and cup fretted themselves up  and down against the table frames, in the skipper's basket lounge  chair wherein I read contrasted romances, East End and Zulu, on  the deck where I groped from hold-by to hold-by, longing to  change grey sky and green sea-trenches for sunshine and blue  levels of sea and sky. The weather calmed and brightened, but the  presence was unaffected. It remained to my perception eager and  sanguine, no less, no more, than it had seemed at first.    At last the Bluff loomed to south-east. Soon a game of pitch-and-toss  precluded our access to harbor. At last we transshipped, all  three of us, boy and dog and I, to a steam-launch, and were soon  ashore. No, I won't say four of us. The presence did not make  itself felt as taking a share in that scramble of ours. I was  rather surprised at missing its company, when I found time to  think about it.  I was standing at ease in the Base Office then.  Soon I was on my way back again to the station where I had left  my convoy. The boy was mounting guard over dog and gear. Yes,  everything seemed all right. I turned towards the ticket office.  As I waited for our tickets I evolved a sort of rationale of my  consciousness of that presence. He who had accompanied me was  very weak, distinctly convalescent. He could but make himself  felt clinically, so to speak. When at length I was aboard the  train I had opportunity to test my surmises. There were six  sleeping berths in the Jo'burg second class compartment (there  was no third class, worse luck, on that train) wherein I found  myself. On one side slept the dark Theosophist who was to lend me  'The Star of the East' next morning. Under him slept the  Norwegian recruit bound for Potchefstroom. Under him again a  fresh-colored, wizened little Colonist. On my side slept an  Africander recruit for Potchefstroom (God love him! I hope he was  better than his looks and conversation). I was bedded over him.  Above me on the sixth sleeping ledge was only a certain amount of  luggage. So we had arranged, and so my eyes assured me. But I  became firmly conscious that the presence was reclining there.    Next night I was able to travel on third class from Johannesburg  without missing my train's connection. I had the carriage to  myself (not without misgivings, for the guard had cleared a  native out, and other compartments seemed likely to be rather  crowded). I lay down somewhat prayerlessly. The last light seemed  to have not long faded on the white mine-banks. I woke in the  chill of the dawn. The train was nearing Mafeking. The presence I  had been too tired to think much about last night, was assuredly  there on the other side of the carriage. Yet there was only my  bag to be seen on the seat, my bag that I had set there to search  for a towel.    The next night we drew near to Bulawayo. I had a Jew for  traveling companion then. He was to get off about midnight at  Francistown. I dropped off to sleep somehow. I don't know exactly  how the trick was done, I was so excited at nearing my own  country. When I awoke the Jew was gone, and the seat opposite me  was empty, empty save for the presence which reclined there. I  gave it a share of my attention amongst other persons and  matters. I was far too full of plans and anticipations now to  sleep. Yet I fought for sleep that next hour or two. Then, as the  cocks had crowed undoubtedly, I lighted a pipe. Afterwards I  stole out in the faint light to shave. When I returned, I was  confronted by an old acquaintance a detective. He wanted  information about me, naturally enough, as it was war-time. He  sat himself down on the seat whereon the presence was. I had  squirmed when he shook hands with me so heartily (I had twisted  my hand, slipping on a warship's deck). I was disposed to squirm  once again. When he sat down rudely on that seat which I knew to  be occupied, I forgot myself at once, and drew him to a seat  beside me. 'Can't you see what's there?' I said hastily. Of  course"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#20)"],[1," that it is necessarily deducible from  Chymicall Experiments, and the true Notion of Mistion. To explain  this a little, I assume, that Bodies may be mingl'd, and that very  durably, that are not Elementary or resolv'd [Errata: nor have been  resolved] into Elements or Principles that they may be mingl'd; as is  evident in the _Regulus_ of Colliquated Antimony, and Iron newly  mention'd; and in Gold Coyne, which lasts so many ages; wherein  generally the Gold is alloy'd by the mixture of a quantity, greater or  lesser, (in our Mints they use about a 12th. part) of either silver,  or Copper, or both. Next, I consider, that there being but one  Universal matter of things, as 'tis known that the _Aristotelians_  themselves acknowledge, who call it _Materia Prima_ (about which  nevertheless I like not all their Opinions,) the Portions of this  matter seem to differ from One Another, but in certain Qualities or  Accidents, fewer or more; upon whose Account the Corporeal Substance  they belong to receives its Denomination, and is referr'd to this or  that particular sort of Bodies; so that if it come to lose, or be  depriv'd of those Qualities, though it ceases not to be a body, yet it  ceases from being that kind of Body as a Plant, or Animal; or Red,  Green, Sweet, Sowre, or the like. I consider that it very often  happens that the small parts of Bodies cohere together but by  immediate Contact and Rest; and that however, there are few Bodies  whose minute Parts stick so close together, to what cause soever their  Combination be ascrib'd, but that it is possible to meet with some  other Body, whose small Parts may get between them, and so dis-joyn  them; or may be fitted to cohere more strongly with some of them, then  those some do with the rest; or at least may be combin'd so closely  with them, as that neither the Fire, nor the other usual Instruments  of Chymical Anatomies will separate them. These things being promis'd,  I will not peremptorily deny, but that there may be some Clusters of  Particles, wherein the Particles are so minute, and the Coherence so  strict, or both, that when Bodies of Differing Denominations, and  consisting of such durable Clusters, happen to be mingl'd, though the  Compound Body made up of them may be very Differing from either of  the Ingredients, yet each of the little Masses or Clusters may so  retain its own Nature, as to be again separable, such as it was  before. As when Gold and Silver being melted together in a Due  Proportion (for in every Proportion, the Refiners will tell You that  the Experiment will not succeed) _Aqua Fortis_ will dissolve the  Silver, and leave the Gold untoucht; by which means, as you lately  noted, both the Metalls may be recover'd from the mixed Mass. But  (Continues _Carneades_) there are other Clusters wherein the Particles  stick not so close together, but that they may meet with Corpuscles of  another Denomination, which are dispos'd to be more closely United  with some of them, then they were among themselves. And in such case,  two thus combining Corpuscles losing that Shape, or Size, or Motion,  or other Accident, upon whose Account they were endow'd with such a  Determinate Quality or Nature, each of them really ceases to be a  Corpuscle of the same Denomination it was before; and from the  Coalition of these there may emerge a new Body, as really one, as  either of the Corpuscles was before they were mingl'd, or, if you  please, Confounded: Since this Concretion is really endow'd with its  own Distinct qualities, and can no more by the Fire, or any other  known way of _Analysis_, be divided again into the Corpuscles that at  first concurr'd to make it, than either of them could by the same  means be subdivided into other Particles. But (sayes _Eleutherius_) to  make this more intelligible by particular examples; If you dissolve  Copper in _Aqua Fortis_, or Spirit of Nitre, (for I remember not which  I us'd, nor do I think it much Material) You may by Crystalizing the  Solution Obtain a goodly Vitriol; which though by Virtue of the  Composition it have manifestly diverse Qualities, not to be met with  in either of the Ingredients, yet it seems that the Nitrous Spirits,  or at least many of them, may in this Compounded Mass retain their  former Nature; for having for tryal sake Distill'd this Vitrioll  Spirit, there came over store of Red Fumes, which by that Colour, by  their peculiar stinke, and by their Sourness, manifested themselves to  be, Nitrous Spirits; and that the remaining Calx continu'd Copper, I  suppose you'l easily beleeve. But if you dissolve _Minium_, which is  but Lead Powder'd by the Fire, in good Spirit of Vinager, and  Crystalize the Solution, you shall not only have a Saccharine Salt  exceedingly differing from both its Ingredients; but the Union of some  Parts of the _Menstruum_ with some of those of the Metal is so strict,  that the Spirit of Vinager seems to be, as such, destroy'd, since the  Saline Corpuscles have quite lost that acidity, upon whose Account the  Liquor was call'd Spirit of Vinager; nor can any such Acid Parts as  were put to the _Minium_ be Separated by any known way from the  _Saccharum Saturni_ resulting from them both; for not only there is no  Sowrness at all, but an admirable Sweetness to be tasted in the  Concretion; and not only I found not that Spirit of Wine, which  otherwise will immediately hiss when mingl'd with strong Spirit of  Vinager, would hiss being pour'd upon _Saccharum Saturni_, wherein yet  the Acid Salt of Vinager, did it Survive, may seem to be concentrated;  but upon the Distillation of _Saccharum Saturni_ by its Self I found  indeed a Liquor very Penetrant, but not at all Acid, and differing as  well in smell and other Qualities, as in tast, from the Spirit of  Vinager; which likewise seem'd to have left some of its Parts very  firmly united to the _Caput Mortuum_, which though of a Leaden Nature  was in smell, Colour, &c. differing from _Minium_; which brings into  my mind, that though two Powders, the one Blew, and the other Yellow,  may appear a Green mixture, without either of them losing its own  Colour, as a good Microscope has sometimes inform'd me; yet having  mingl'd _Minium_ and _Sal Armoniack_ in a requisite Proportion, and  expos'd them in a Glass Vessel to the Fire, the whole Mass became  White, and the Red Corpuscles were destroy'd; for though the Calcin'd  Lead was separable from the Salt, yet you'l easily beleeve it did not  part from it in the Forme of a Red Powder, such as was the _Minium_,  when it was put to the _Sal Armoniack_. I leave it also to be  consider'd, whether in Blood, and divers other Bodies, it be probable,  that each of the Corpuscles that concurr to make a Compound Body doth,  though some of them in some Cases may, retain its own Nature in it,  so that Chymsts [Transcriber's Note: Chymists] may Extricate each sort  of them from all the others, wherewith it concurr'd to make a Body of  one Denomination.    I know there may be a Distinction betwixt Matter _Immanent_, when the  material Parts remain and retain their own Nature in the things  materiated, as some of the Schoolmen speak, (in which sence Wood,  Stones and Lime are the matter of a House,) and _Transient_, which in  the materiated thing is so alter'd, as to receive a new Forme, without  being capable of re-admitting again the Old. In which sence the  Friends of this Distinction say, that _Chyle_ is the matter of Blood,  and Blood that of a Humane Body, of all whose Parts 'tis presum'd to  be the Aliment. I know also that it may be said, that of material  Principles, some are _common_ to all mixt Bodies, as _Aristotles_ four  Elements, or the Chymists _Tria Prima_; others _Peculiar_, which  belong to this or that sort of Bodies; as Butter and a kind of whey  may be said to be the Proper Principles of Cream: and I deny not, but  that these Distinctions may in some Cases be of Use; but partly by  what I have said already, and partly by what I am to say, You may  easily enough guess in what sence I admit them, and discerne that in  such a sence they will either illustrate some of my Opinions, or at  least will not overthrow any of them.    To prosecute then what I was saying before, I will add to this  purpose, That since the Major part of Chymists Credit, what those they  call Philosophers affirme of their Stone, I may represent to them,  that though when Common Gold and Lead are mingled Together, the Lead  may be sever'd almost un-alter'd from the Gold; yet if instead of Gold  a _Tantillum_ of the Red _Elixir_ be mingled with the Saturn, their  Union will be so indissoluble in the perfect Gold that will be  produc'd by it, that there is no known, nor perhaps no possible way of  separating the diffus'd _Elixir_ from the fixed Lead, but they both  Constitute a most permanent Body, wherein the Saturne seems to have  quite lost its Properties that made it be call'd Lead, and to have  been rather transmuted by the _Elixir_, then barely associated to it.  So that it seems not alwayes necessary, that the Bodies that are put  together _per minima_, should each retain its own Nature; So as when  the Mass it Self is dissipated by the Fire, to be more dispos'd to  re-appear in its Pristine Forme, then in any new one, which by a  stricter association of its Parts with those of some of the other  Ingredients of the _Compositum_, then with one another, it may have  acquired.    And if it be objected, that unless the _Hypothesis_ I oppose be  admitted, in such Cases as I have proposed there would not be an Union  but a Destruction of mingled Bodies, which seems all one as to say,  that of such Bodies there is no mistion at all; I answer, that  _though_ the Substances that are mingl'd remain, only their Accidents  are Destroy'd, and _though_ we may with tollerable Congruity call them  _Miscibilia_, because they are Distinct Bodies before they are put  together, however afterwards they are"]]]
