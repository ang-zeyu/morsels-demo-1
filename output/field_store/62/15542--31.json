That bottle of yours  would do.\"    So between them they managed, with bits of stick and by singeing their  fingers a little, to poke and shove the dragon till they made it creep  into the silver hunting bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top  tight.    \"Now we've got him,\" said Elfin. \"Let's take him home and put Solomon's  seal on the mouth of the bottle, and then he'll be safe enough. Come  along--we'll divide up the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some  money to buy fine clothes to go courting in.\"    But when the wicked Prince made promises he did not make them to keep.    \"Go on with you! What do you mean?\" he said. \"I found the dragon and  I've imprisoned him. I never said a word about courtings or kingdoms. If  you say I did, I shall cut your head off at once.\" And he drew his  sword.    \"All right,\" said Elfin, shrugging his shoulders. \"I'm better off than  you are, anyhow.\"    \"What do you mean?\" spluttered the Prince.    \"Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've got clean hands  (and five and seventy fine black pigs).\"    So Elfin sat down again by his fire, and the Prince went home and told  his Parliament how clever and brave he had been, and though he woke them  up on purpose to tell them, they were not angry, but said: \"You are  indeed brave and clever.\" For they knew what happened to people with  whom the Prince was not pleased.    Then the Prime Minister solemnly put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the  bottle, and the bottle was put in the Treasury, which was the strongest  building in the town, and was made of solid copper, with walls as thick  as Waterloo Bridge.    The bottle was set down among the sacks of gold, and the junior  secretary to the junior clerk of the last Lord of the Treasury was  appointed to sit up all night with it and see if anything happened. The  junior secretary had never seen a dragon, and, what was more, he did not  believe the Prince had ever seen a dragon either. The Prince had never  been a really truthful boy, and it would have been just like him to  bring home a bottle with nothing in it and then to pretend that there  was a dragon inside. So the junior secretary did not at all mind being  left. They gave him the key, and when everyone in the town had gone back  to bed he let in some of the junior secretaries from other Government  departments, and they had a jolly game of hide-and-seek among the sacks  of gold, and played marbles with the diamonds and rubies and pearls in  the big ivory chests.    They enjoyed themselves very much, but by-and-by the copper treasury  began to get warmer and warmer, and suddenly the junior secretary cried  out, \"Look at the bottle!\"    The bottle sealed with Solomon's seal had swollen to three times its  proper size and seemed to be nearly red hot, and the air got warmer and  warmer and the bottle bigger and bigger, till all the junior secretaries  agreed that the place was too hot to hold them, and out they went,  tumbling over each other in their haste, and just as the last got out  and locked the door the bottle burst, and out came the dragon, very  fiery, and swelling more and more every minute, and he began to eat the  sacks of gold and crunch up the pearls and diamonds and rubies as if  they were sugar.    By breakfasttime he had devoured the whole of the Prince's treasures,  and when the Prince came along the street at about eleven, he met the  dragon coming out of the broken door of the Treasury, with molten gold  still dripping from his jaws. Then the Prince turned and ran for his  life, and as he ran toward the dragonproof tower the little white  Princess saw him coming, and she ran down and unlocked the door and let  him in, and slammed the dragonproof door in the fiery face of the  dragon, who sat down and whined outside, because he wanted the Prince  very much indeed.    The Princess took Prince Tiresome into the best room, and laid the  cloth, and gave him cream and eggs and white grapes and honey and bread,  with many other things, yellow and white and good to eat, and she served  him just as kindly as she would have done if he had been anyone else  instead of the bad Prince who had taken away her kingdom and kept it for  himself--because she was a true Princess and had a heart of gold.    When he had eaten and drunk, he begged the Princess to show him how to  lock and unlock the door. The nurse was asleep, so there was no one to  tell the Princess not to, and she did.    [Illustration: \"The junior secretary cried out, 'Look at the bottle!'\"  _See page 129._]    \"You turn the key like this,\" she said, \"and the door keeps shut. But  turn it nine times around the wrong way, and the door flies open.\"    And so it did. And the moment it opened, the Prince pushed the white  Princess out of her tower, just as he had pushed her out of her kingdom,  and shut the door. For he wanted to have the tower all for himself. And  there she was, in the street, and on the other side of the way the  dragon was sitting whining, but he did not try to eat her,  because--though the old nurse did not know it--dragons cannot eat white  Princesses with hearts of gold.    The Princess could not walk through the streets of the town in her  milky-silky gown with the daisies on it, and with no hat and no gloves,  so she turned the other way, and ran out across the meadows, toward the  wood. She had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass  under her feet felt like grass of Paradise.    She ran right into the thickest part of the wood, because she did not  know what her heart was made of, and she was afraid of the dragon, and  there in a dell she came on Elfin and his five and seventy fine pigs. He  was playing his flute, and around him the pigs were dancing cheerfully  on their hind legs.    \"Oh, dear,\" said the Princess, \"do take care of me. I am so frightened.\"    \"I will,\" said Elfin, putting his arms around her. \"Now you are quite  safe. What were you frightened of?\"    \"The dragon,\" she said.    \"So it's gotten out of the silver bottle,\" said Elfin. \"I hope it's  eaten the Prince.\"    \"No,\" said Sabrinetta. \"But why?\"    He told her of the mean trick that the Prince had played on him.    \"And he promised me half his kingdom and the hand of his cousin the  Princess,\" said Elfin.    \"Oh, dear, what a shame!\" said Sabrinetta, trying to get out of his  arms. \"How dare he?\"    \"What's the matter?\" he asked, holding her tighter. \"It _was_ a shame,  or at least _I_ thought so. But now he may keep his kingdom, half and  whole, if I may keep what I have.\"    \"What's that?\" asked the Princess.    \"Why, you--my pretty, my dear,\" said Elfin, \"and as for the Princess,  his cousin--forgive me, dearest heart, but when I asked for her I hadn't  seen the real Princess, the _only_ Princess, _my_ Princess.\"    \"Do you mean me?\" said Sabrinetta.    \"Who else?\" he asked.    \"Yes, but five minutes ago you hadn't seen me!\"    \"Five minutes ago I was a pig keeper--now I've held you in my arms I'm a  Prince, though I should have to keep pigs to the end of my days.\"    \"But you haven't asked _me_,\" said the Princess.    \"You asked me to take care of you,\" said Elfin, \"and I will--all my life  long.\"    So that was settled, and they began to talk of really important things,  such as the dragon and the Prince, and all the time Elfin did not know  that this was the Princess, but he knew that she had a heart of gold,  and he told her so, many times.    \"The mistake,\" said Elfin, \"was in not having a dragonproof bottle. I  see that now.\"    \"Oh, is that all?\" said the Princess. \"I can easily get you one of  those--because everything in my tower is dragonproof. We ought to do  something to settle the dragon and save the little children.\"    So she started off to get the bottle, but she would not let Elfin come  with her.    \"If what you say is true,\" she said, \"if you are sure that I have a  heart of gold, the dragon won't hurt me, and somebody must stay with the  pigs.\"    Elfin was quite sure, so he let her go.    She found the door of her tower open. The dragon had waited patiently  for the Prince, and the moment he opened the door and came out--though  he was only out for an instant to post a letter to his Prime Minister  saying where he was and asking them to send the fire brigade to deal  with the fiery dragon--the dragon ate him. Then the dragon went back to  the wood, because it was getting near his time to grow small for the  night.    So Sabrinetta went in and kissed her nurse and made her a cup of tea and  explained what was going to happen, and that she had a heart of gold, so  the dragon couldn't eat her; and the nurse saw that of course the  Princess was quite safe, and kissed her and let her go.    She took the dragonproof bottle, made of burnished brass, and ran back  to the wood, and to the dell, where Elfin was sitting among his sleek  black pigs, waiting for her.    \"I thought you were never coming back,\" he said. \"You have been away a  year, at least.\"    The Princess sat down beside him among the pigs, and they held each  other's hands till it was dark, and then the dragon came crawling over  the moss, scorching it as he came, and getting smaller as he crawled,  and curled up under the root of the tree.    \"Now then,\" said Elfin, \"you hold the bottle.\" Then he poked and prodded  the dragon with bits of stick till it crawled into the dragonproof  bottle. But there was no stopper.    \"Never mind,\" said Elfin. \"I'll put my finger in for a stopper.\"    \"No, let me,\" said the Princess. But of course Elfin would not let her.  He stuffed his finger into the top of the bottle, and the Princess cried  out: \"The sea--the sea--run for the cliffs!\" And off they went, with the  five and seventy pigs trotting steadily after them in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#20)"],[1," them, because he did; and, although so  well wrapped up, he was always cold. He suffered whenever the wind blew.  The old Medicine Man said, \"We don't need your chest pads, and you would  not if you took the Sky Medicine.\" So the trader tried it, and by and  by, to his surprise and joy, no matter whether it was hot or cold  outdoors, he was comfortable.    This man had a friend who was a learned professor in a college, and he  told him about the great thing he had learned from the old Indian. The  professor was not old, but he was very sick and feeble in body. He could  not sleep nights. His hair was falling out, and his mind filled with  gloomy thoughts. The whole world seemed dark to him. He knew it was a  kind of disease, and he went away out West to see his friend. Then he  met the Medicine Man and said to him, \"Can you help me?\"    The wise old Indian said, \"Oh, white man, where do you spend your days?\"    \"I spend them at my desk, in my study, or in the classroom.\"    \"Yes, and your nights?\"    \"In my study among my books.\"    \"And where do you sleep?\"    \"I don't sleep much, though I have a comfortable bed.\"    \"In the house?\"    \"Yes, of course.\"    \"Listen, then, O foolish white man. The Great Spirit set Big Medicine in  the sky to cure our ills. And you hide from it day and night. What do  you expect but evil? This do and be saved. Take the Sky Medicine in  measure of your strength.\"    He did so and it saved him. His strength came back. His cheeks grew  ruddy, his hands grew steady, his hair ceased falling out, he slept like  a baby. He was happy.    Now what is the Sky Medicine? It is the glorious sunlight, that cures so  many human ills. We ask every Woodcrafter to hold on to its blessings.           *       *       *       *       *    And in this wise, O Guide, you must give it to the little ones. Make it  an honourable exploit to be sunburnt to the elbows without blistering;  another to be sunburnt to the shoulders; another to the waist; and  greatest of all, when sunburnt all over. How are they to get this? Let  them go to some quiet place for the last, and let the glory fall on  their naked bodies, for ten minutes each day. Some more, and some less,  according to their strength, and this is the measure--so long as it is  pleasant, it is good.    In this way they will inherit one of the good things of the woods and be  strong and hardened, for there is no greater medicine than the Sun in  the sky.      TALE 72    The Angel of the Night    O Guide of the young Tribe! Know you the Twelfth Secret of the Woods?  Know you what walked around your tent on that thirtieth night of your  camp out? No! I think you knew, if you continued for thirty nights, but  you knew not that you knew. These things, then, you should have in  heart, and give to those you are leading.    The Great Spirit does not put out good air in the daytime and poison air  at night. It is the same pure air at night, only cooler. Therefore use  more clothing while you sleep. But while the outdoor air is pure, the  indoor may be foul. Therefore sleep out of doors, and you will learn the  blessedness of the night, and the night air, with its cooling kindly  influence laden.    Those who come here to our Camp from life in town and sleeping in close  rooms, are unaccustomed, and nervous it may be, so that they sleep  little at first. But each night brings its balm of rest. Strength comes.  Some know it in a week. The town-worn and nerve-weary find it at  farthest in half a moon. And in one full moon be sure of this, when the  night comes down you will find the blessed balm that the Great Spirit  meant for all of us. You will sleep, a calm sweet vitalizing sleep.    You will know this the twelfth secret of the woods: What walked around  your tent that thirtieth night? You know not, you heard nothing, for you  slept. Yet when the morning comes you feel and know that round your  couch, with wings and hands upraised in blessed soothing influence,  there passed the Angel of the Night, with healing under her wings, and  peace. You saw her not, you heard her not, but the sweet healing of her  presence will be with you for many after moons.

THINGS TO DO    [Illustration: Nests of Kingbird, Oriole, Vireo, Robin, Goldfinch,  Phoebe (1/4 life size)]          Things to Do      TALE 73    Bird-nesting in Winter    What good are old bird-nests? These are some of the ends they serve. A  Deermouse seeking the safety of a bramble thicket and a warm house, will  make his own nest in the forsaken home of a Cat-bird. A Gray Squirrel  will roof over the open nest of a Crow or Hawk and so make it a castle  in the air for himself. But one of the strangest uses is this: The  Solitary Sandpiper is a bird that cannot build a tree nest for itself  and yet loves to give to its eggs the safety of a high place; so it lays  in the old nest of a Robin, or other tree bird, and there its young are  hatched. But this is only in the Far North. There are plenty of old  bird-nests left for other uses, and for you.    Bird-nesting in summer is wicked, cruel, and against the law. But  bird-nesting in winter is good fun and harms no one, if we take only the  little nests that are built in forked twigs, or on rock ledges. For most  little birds prefer to make a new nest for themselves each season.    If you get: A Goldfinch, floss nest;    A Phoebe, moss nest;    A Robin, mud nest;    A Vireo, good nest;    A Kingbird, rag nest;    An Oriole, bag nest;    you have six different kinds of beautiful nests that are easily kept  for the museum, and you do no harm in taking them.      TALE 74    The Ox-eye Daisy or Marguerite    [Illustration: The Ox-eye Daisy or Marguerite]    Do you know that \"Daisy\" means \"day's eye,\" because the old country  Daisy opens its eyes when day comes, and shuts them every night. But our  Daisy is different and much bigger, so we have got into the way of  calling it \"Ox-eye.\" Some of our young people call it \"Love-me;  love-me-not,\" because they think it can tell if one is loved. They pull  out the white rays of the flower one by one, saying, \"He loves me; he  loves me not; he loves me; he loves me not.\" Then what they are saying  as the last is pulled, settles the question. If the Daisy says \"He loves  me,\" they take a second Daisy and ask the next question, \"Will he marry  me?\" Then, pulling the rays as before, \"This year, next year, some time,  never.\" And in this way they learn all that the Daisies know about these  important matters.    We call it \"our Daisy,\" but it is not a true native of America. Its home  is Europe. The settlers of New England, missing the flower of their  homeland, brought it over and planted it in their gardens. It spread  widely in the North; but it did not reach the South until the time of  the Civil War, when it is said to have gone in with the hay for  Sherman's Army, to become a troublesome weed in the fields.           *       *       *       *       *    This scrap of history is recorded in a popular ballad.            There's a story told in Georgia            'Tis in everybody's mouth,          That 'twas old Tecumseh Sherman            Brought the Daisy to the South.          Ne'er that little blossom stranger            In our land was known to be,          Till he marched his blue-coat army            From Atlanta to the sea.    [Illustration: The Monkeys in the Tree Tops]      TALE 75    A Monkey-hunt    We all love to go a-hunting; every one of us in some way; and it is only  the dislike of cruelty and destruction that keeps most of us from  hunting animals continually, as our forebears did.    Some of my best days were spent in hunting. The Arabs say, \"Allah  reckons not against a man's allotted span the days he spends in the  chase.\"    I hope that I may help many of you to go a-hunting, and to get the good  things of it, with the bad things left out.    Come! Now it is the spring of the year, and just the right time for a  Monkey-hunt. We are going prowling along the brookside where we are  pretty sure of finding our game. \"See, there is a Monkey tree and it is  full of the big Monkeys!\"    \"What! That pussy-willow?\"    Yes, you think they are only pussy-willows, but wait until you see. We  shall take home a band of the Monkeys, tree and all, and you will learn  that a pussy-willow is only a baby Monkey half done.    Now let us get a branch of live elderberry and one or two limbs of the  low red sumac. It is best to use sumac because it is the only handy wood  that one can easily stick a pin through, or cut. The pieces should be  five or six inches long and about half an inch to an inch thick. They  should have as many odd features as possible, knots, bumps, fungus,  moss, etc.; all of which add interest to the picture.    To these we must add a lot of odd bits of dry cane, dry grasses, old  flower-stalks, moss, and gravel, etc., to use for background and  foreground in the little jungle we are to make for our Monkeys to play  in. It is delightful to find the new interest that all sorts of queer  weeds take on, when we view them as canes or palms for our little  jungle.    Now with the spoils of our hunt, let us go home and preserve the  trophies.    Cut off about three inches of the elderberry wood and have it clear of  knots; cut a flat ended ramrod so as just to fit the bore, and force out  the pith with one clean sharp push: or else whittle away the surrounding  wood. The latter way gives a better quality of pith.    Now take a piece of the pith about one-third the size of a big  pussy-willow, use a very sharp knife and you will find it easy to  whittle it into a Monkey's head about the shape of \"a\" and \"b.\"    Use a very sharp-pointed, soft black pencil to make the eyes, nose, the  line"]]]
