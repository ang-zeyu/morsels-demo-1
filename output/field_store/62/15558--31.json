And let us now compare together the moments of momentum  in these two cases. It can be shown by reasoning, into which I need  not now enter, that the moment of momentum of the large sphere will be  thirty-two times that of the small one. In general we may state that  if a sphere of homogeneous material be rotating about an axis, its  moment of momentum is to be expressed by the product of its angular  velocity by the fifth power of its radius.    We can now take stock, as it were, of the constituents of moments of  momentum in our system. We may omit the satellites for the present,  while such unsubstantial bodies as comets and such small bodies as  meteors need not concern us. The present investment of the moment of  momentum of our system is to be found by multiplying the mass of each  planet by the square root of its distance from the sun; these products  for all the several planets form the total revolutional moment of  momentum. The remainder of the investment is in rotational moment of  momentum, the collective amount of which is to be estimated by  multiplying the angular velocity of each planet into its density, and  the fifth power of its radius if the planet be regarded as  homogeneous, or into such other power as may be necessary when the  planet is not homogeneous. Indeed, as the denser parts of the planet  necessarily lie in its interior, and have therefore neither the  velocity nor the radius of the more superficial portions, it seems  necessary to admit that the moments of momentum of the planets will be  proportional to some lower power of the radius than the fifth. The  total moment of momentum of the planets by rotation, when multiplied  by a constant factor, and added to the revolutional moment of  momentum, will remain absolutely constant.    It may be interesting to note the present disposition of this vast  inheritance among the different bodies of our system. The biggest item  of all is the moment of momentum of Jupiter, due to its revolution  around the sun; in fact, in this single investment nearly sixty per  cent. of the total moment of momentum of the solar system is found.  The next heaviest item is the moment of momentum of Saturn's  revolution, which is twenty-four per cent. Then come the similar  contributions of Uranus and Neptune, which are six and eight per cent.  respectively. Only one more item is worth mentioning, as far as  magnitude is concerned, and that is the nearly two per cent. that the  sun contains in virtue of its _rotation_. In fact, all the other  moments of momentum are comparatively insignificant in this method of  viewing the subject. Jupiter from his rotation has not the fifty  thousandth part of his revolutional moment of momentum, while the  earth's rotational share is not one ten thousandth part of that of  Jupiter, and therefore is without importance in the general aspect of  the system. The revolution of the earth contributes about one eight  hundredth part of that of Jupiter.    These facts as here stated will suffice for us to make a forecast of  the utmost the tides can effect in the future transformation of our  system. We have already explained that the general tendency of tidal  friction is to augment revolutional moment of momentum at the expense  of rotational. The total, however, of the rotational moment of  momentum of the system barely reaches two per cent. of the whole  amount; this is of course almost entirely contributed by the sun, for  all the planets together have not a thousandth part of the sun's  rotational moment. The utmost therefore that tidal evolution can  effect in the system is to distribute the two per cent. in augmenting  the revolutionary moment of momentum. It does not seem that this can  produce much appreciable derangement in the configuration of the  system. No doubt if it were all applied to one of the smaller planets  it would produce very considerable effect. Our earth, for instance,  would have to be driven out to a distance many hundreds of times  further than it is at present were the sun's disposable moment of  momentum ultimately to be transferred to the earth alone. On the other  hand, Jupiter could absorb the whole of the sun's share by quite an  insignificant enlargement of its present path. It does not seem likely  that the distribution that must ultimately take place can much affect  the present configuration of the system.    We thus see that the tides do not appear to have exercised anything  like the same influence in the affairs of our solar system generally  which they have done in that very small part of the solar system which  consists of the earth and moon. This is, as I have endeavoured to show  in these lectures, the scene of supremely interesting tidal phenomena;  but how small it is in comparison with the whole magnitude of our  system may be inferred from the following illustration. I represent  the whole moment of momentum of our system by L1,000,000,000, the bulk  of which is composed of the revolutional moments of momentum of the  great planets, and the rotational moment of momentum of the sun. On  this scale the rotational share which has fallen to our earth and moon  does not even rise to the dignity of a single pound, it can only be  represented by the very modest figure of 19_s._ 5_d._ This is divided  into two parts--the earth by its rotation accounts for 3_s._ 4_d._,  leaving 16_s._ 1_d._ as the equivalent of the revolution of the moon.  The other inferior planets have still less to show than the earth.  Venus can barely have more than 2_s._ 6_d._; even Mars' two satellites  cannot bring his figure up beyond the slender value of 1-1/2_d._;  while Mercury will be amply represented by the smallest coin known at  her Majesty's mint.    The same illustration will bring out the contrast between the Jovian  system and our earth system. The rotational share of the former would  be totally represented by a sum of nearly L12,000; of this, however,  Jupiter's satellites only contribute about L89, notwithstanding that  there are four of them. Thus Jupiter's satellites have not one  hundredth part of the moment of momentum which the rotation of Jupiter  exhibits. How wide is the contrast between this state of things and  the earth-moon system, for the earth does not contain in its rotation  one-fifth of the moment of momentum that the moon has in its  revolution; in fact, the moon has gradually robbed the earth, which  originally possessed 19_s._ 5_d._, of which the moon has carried off  all but 3_s._ 4_d._    And this process is still going on, so that ultimately the earth will  be left very poor, though not absolutely penniless, at least if the  retention of a halfpenny can be regarded as justifying that assertion.  Saturn, revolving as it does with great rapidity, and having a very  large mass, possesses about L2700, while Uranus and Neptune taken  together would figure for about the same amount.    In conclusion, let us revert again to the two critical conditions of  the earth-moon system. As to what happened before the first critical  period, the tides tell us nothing, and every other line of reasoning  very little; we can to some extent foresee what may happen after the  second critical epoch is reached, at a time so remote that I do not  venture even to express the number of ciphers which ought to follow  the significant digit in the expression for the number of years. I  mentioned, however, that at this time the sun tides will produce the  effect of applying a still further brake to the rotation of the earth,  so that ultimately the month will have become a shorter period than  the day. It is therefore interesting for us to trace out the tidal  history of a system in which the satellite revolves around the primary  in less time than the primary takes to go round on its own axis--such  a system, in fact, as Mars would present at this moment were the outer  satellite to be abstracted. The effect of the tides on the planet  raised by its satellite would then be to accelerate its rotation; for  as the planet, so to speak, lags behind the tides, friction would now  manifest itself by the continuous endeavour to drag the primary round  faster. The gain of speed, however, thus attained would involve the  primary in performing more than its original share of the moment of  momentum; less moment of momentum would therefore remain to be done by  the satellite, and the only way to accomplish this would be for the  satellite to come inwards and revolve in a smaller orbit.    We might indeed have inferred this from the considerations of energy  alone, for whatever happens in the deformation of the orbit, heat is  produced by the friction, and this heat is lost, and the total energy  of the system must consequently decline. Now if it be a consequence of  the tides that the velocity of the primary is accelerated, the energy  corresponding to that velocity is also increased. Hence the primary  has more energy than it had before; this energy must have been  obtained at the expense of the satellite; the satellite must therefore  draw inwards until it has yielded up enough of energy not alone to  account for the increased energy of the primary, but also for the  absolute loss of energy by which the whole operation is characterized.    It therefore appears that in the excessively remote future the retreat  of the moon will not only be checked, but that the moon may actually  return to a point to be determined by the changes in the earth's  rotation. It is, however, extremely difficult to follow up the study  of a case where the problem of three bodies has become even more  complicated than usual.    The importance of tidal evolution in our solar system has also to be  viewed in connection with the celebrated nebular hypothesis of the  origin of the solar system. Of course it would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 2 (#20)"],[1,"at, had any  attempt been made to deprive him of his temporalities, he would have  put himself under the protection of the common law; and Herbert himself  declared that, at common law, judgment must be given against the crown.  This consideration induced the King to pause. Only a few weeks had  elapsed since he had packed the courts of Westminster Hall in order to  obtain a decision in favour of his dispensing power. He now found that,  unless he packed them again, he should not be able to obtain a decision  in favour of the proceedings of his Ecclesiastical Commission. He  determined, therefore, to postpone for a short time the confiscation of  the freehold property of refractory clergymen. [102]    The temper of the nation was indeed such as might well make him  hesitate. During some months discontent had been steadily and rapidly  increasing. The celebration of the Roman Catholic worship had long been  prohibited by Act of Parliament. During several generations no Roman  Catholic clergyman had dared to exhibit himself in any public place with  the badges of his office. Against the regular clergy, and against the  restless and subtle Jesuits by name, had been enacted a succession of  rigorous statutes. Every Jesuit who set foot in this country was  liable to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. A reward was offered for his  detection. He was not allowed to take advantage of the general rule,  that men are not bound to accuse themselves. Whoever was suspected of  being a Jesuit might be interrogated, and, if he refused to answer,  might be sent to prison for life. [103] These laws, though they had not,  except when there was supposed to be some peculiar danger, been strictly  executed, and though they had never prevented Jesuits from resorting to  England, had made disguise necessary. But all disguise was now thrown  off. Injudicious members of the King's Church, encouraged by him, took  a pride in defying statutes which were still of undoubted validity,  and feelings which had a stronger hold of the national mind than at any  former period. Roman Catholic chapels rose all over the country. Cowls,  girdles of ropes, and strings of beads constantly appeared in the  streets, and astonished a population, the oldest of whom had never seen  a conventual garb except on the stage. A convent rose at Clerkenwell on  the site of the ancient cloister of Saint John. The Franciscans occupied  a mansion in Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Carmelites were quartered in the  City. A society of Benedictine monks was lodged in Saint James's Palace.  In the Savoy a spacious house, including a church and a school, was  built for the Jesuits. [104] The skill and care with which those fathers  had, during several generations, conducted the education of youth, had  drawn forth reluctant praises from the wisest Protestants. Bacon had  pronounced the mode of instruction followed in the Jesuit colleges to  be the best yet known in the world, and had warmly expressed his regret  that so admirable a system of intellectual and moral discipline should  be subservient to the interests of a corrupt religion. [105] It was  not improbable that the new academy in the Savoy might, under royal  patronage, prove a formidable rival to the great foundations of Eton,  Westminster, and Winchester. Indeed, soon after the school was opened,  the classes consisted of four hundred boys, about one half of whom were  Protestants. The Protestant pupils were not required to attend mass: but  there could be no doubt that the influence of able preceptors, devoted  to the Roman Catholic Church, and versed in all the arts which win the  confidence and affection of youth, would make many converts.    These things produced great excitement among the populace, which is  always more moved by what impresses the senses than by what is  addressed to the reason. Thousands of rude and ignorant men, to whom the  dispensing power and the Ecclesiastical Commission were words without a  meaning, saw with dismay and indignation a Jesuit college rising on the  banks of the Thames, friars in hoods and gowns walking in the Strand,  and crowds of devotees pressing in at the doors of temples where homage  was paid to graven images. Riots broke out in several parts of the  country. At Coventry and Worcester the Roman Catholic worship was  violently interrupted. [106] At Bristol the rabble, countenanced, it was  said, by the magistrates, exhibited a profane and indecent pageant, in  which the Virgin Mary was represented by a buffoon, and in which a mock  host was carried in procession. The garrison was called out to disperse  the mob. The mob, then and ever since one of the fiercest in the  kingdom, resisted. Blows were exchanged, and serious hurts inflicted.  [107] The agitation was great in the capital, and greater in the City,  properly so called, than at Westminster. For the people of Westminster  had been accustomed to see among them the private chapels of Roman  Catholic Ambassadors: but the City had not, within living memory, been  polluted by any idolatrous exhibition. Now, however, the resident of  the Elector Palatine, encouraged by the King, fitted up a chapel in Lime  Street. The heads of the corporation, though men selected for office  on account of their known Toryism, protested against this proceeding,  which, as they said, the ablest gentlemen of the long robe regarded as  illegal. The Lord Mayor was ordered to appear before the Privy Council.  \"Take heed what you do,\" said the King. \"Obey me; and do not trouble  yourself either about gentlemen of the long robe or gentlemen of the  short robe.\" The Chancellor took up the word, and reprimanded the  unfortunate magistrate with the genuine eloquence of the Old Bailey  bar. The chapel was opened. All the neighbourhood was soon in commotion.  Great crowds assembled in Cheapside to attack the new mass house. The  priests were insulted. A crucifix was taken out of the building and set  up on the parish pump. The Lord Mayor came to quell the tumult, but was  received with cries of \"No wooden gods.\" The trainbands were ordered to  disperse the crowd: but they shared in the popular feeling; and murmurs  were heard from the ranks, \"We cannot in conscience fight for Popery.\"  [108]    The Elector Palatine was, like James, a sincere and zealous Catholic,  and was, like James, the ruler of a Protestant people; but the two  princes resembled each other little in temper and understanding. The  Elector had promised to respect the rights of the Church which he found  established in his dominions. He had strictly kept his word, and had not  suffered himself to be provoked to any violence by the indiscretion of  preachers who, in their antipathy to his faith, occasionally forgot the  respect which they owed to his person. [109] He learned, with concern,  that great offence had been given to the people of London by the  injudicious act of his representative, and, much to his honour, declared  that he would forego the privilege to which, as a sovereign prince, he  was entitled, rather than endanger the peace of a great city. \"I, too,\"  he wrote to James, \"have Protestant subjects; and I know with how much  caution and delicacy it is necessary that a Catholic prince so situated  should act.\" James, instead of expressing gratitude for this humane and  considerate conduct, turned the letter into ridicule before the foreign  ministers. It was determined that the Elector should have a chapel in  the City whether he would or not, and that, if the trainbands refused to  do their duty, their place should be supplied by the Guards. [110]    The effect of these disturbances on trade was serious. The Dutch  minister informed the States General that the business of the Exchange  was at a stand. The Commissioners of the Customs reported to the King  that, during the month which followed the opening of Lime Street Chapel,  the receipt in the port of the Thames had fallen off by some thousands  of pounds. [111] Several Aldermen, who, though zealous royalists  appointed under the new charter, were deeply interested in the  commercial prosperity of their city, and loved neither Popery nor  martial law, tendered their resignations. But the King was resolved  not to yield. He formed a camp on Hounslow Heath, and collected  there, within a circumference of about two miles and a half, fourteen  battalions of foot and thirty-two squadrons of horse, amounting to  thirteen thousand fighting men. Twenty-six pieces of artillery, and  many wains laden with arms and ammunition, were dragged from the Tower  through the City to Hounslow. [112] The Londoners saw this great force  assembled in their neighbourhood with a terror which familiarity soon  diminished. A visit to Hounslow became their favourite amusement on  holidays. The camp presented the appearance of a vast fair. Mingled with  the musketeers and dragoons, a multitude of fine gentlemen and ladies  from Soho Square, sharpers and painted women from Whitefriars, invalids  in sedans, monks in hoods and gowns, lacqueys in rich liveries, pedlars,  orange girls, mischievous apprentices and gaping clowns, was constantly  passing and repassing through the long lanes of tents. From some  pavilions were heard the noises of drunken revelry, from others the  curses of gamblers. In truth the place was merely a gay suburb of the  capital. The King, as was amply proved two years later, had greatly  miscalculated. He had forgotten that vicinity operates in more ways than  one. He had hoped that his army would overawe London: but the result of  his policy was that the feelings and opinions of London took complete  possession of his army. [113]    Scarcely indeed had the encampment been formed when there were rumours  of quarrels between the Protestant and Popish soldiers. [114] A little  tract, entitled A humble and hearty Address to all English Protestants  in the Army, had been actively circulated through the ranks. The"]]]
