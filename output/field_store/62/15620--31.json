For it is this inner verdict of instinctive  idealism that is the point at issue. Of course there is nothing new, or  peculiar to the new world, about a man's engagement practically failing  through his financial failure. An English girl might easily drop a man  because he was poor, or she might stick to him faithfully and defiantly  although he was poor. The point is that this girl was faithful but she  was not defiant; that is, she was not proud. The whole psychology of the  situation was that she shared the weird worldly idealism of her family,  and it was wounded as her patriotism would have been wounded if he had  betrayed his country. To do them justice, there was nothing to show that  they would have had any real respect for a royal duke who had inherited  millions; what the simple barbarians wanted was a man who could 'make  good.' That the process of making good would probably drag him through  the mire of everything bad, that he would make good by bluffing, lying,  swindling, and grinding the faces of the poor, did not seem to trouble  them in the least. Against this fanaticism there is this shadow of truth  even in the fiction of aristocracy; that a gentleman may at least be  allowed to be good without being bothered to make it.    Another objection to the phrase about the almighty dollar is that it is  an almighty phrase, and therefore an almighty nuisance. I mean that it  is made to explain everything, and to explain everything much too well;  that is, much too easily. It does not really help people to understand a  foreign country; but it gives them the fatal illusion that they do  understand it. Dollars stood for America as frogs stood for France;  because it was necessary to connect particular foreigners with  something, or it would be so easy to confuse a Moor with a Montenegrin  or a Russian with a Red Indian. The only cure for this sort of satisfied  familiarity is the shock of something really unfamiliar. When people can  see nothing at all in American democracy except a Yankee running after a  dollar, then the only thing to do is to trip them up as they run after  the Yankee, or run away with their notion of the Yankee, by the obstacle  of certain odd and obstinate facts that have no relation to that notion.  And, as a matter of fact, there are a number of such obstacles to any  such generalisation; a number of notable facts that have to be  reconciled somehow to our previous notions. It does not matter for this  purpose whether the facts are favourable or unfavourable, or whether the  qualities are merits or defects; especially as we do not even understand  them sufficiently to say which they are. The point is that we are  brought to a pause, and compelled to attempt to understand them rather  better than we do. We have found the one thing that we did not expect;  and therefore the one thing that we cannot explain. And we are moved to  an effort, probably an unsuccessful effort, to explain it.    For instance, Americans are very unpunctual. That is the last thing that  a critic expects who comes to condemn them for hustling and haggling and  vulgar ambition. But it is almost the first fact that strikes the  spectator on the spot. The chief difference between the humdrum English  business man and the hustling American business man is that the hustling  American business man is always late. Of course there is a great deal of  difference between coming late and coming too late. But I noticed the  fashion first in connection with my own lectures; touching which I  could heartily recommend the habit of coming too late. I could easily  understand a crowd of commercial Americans not coming to my lectures at  all; but there was something odd about their coming in a crowd, and the  crowd being expected to turn up some time after the appointed hour. The  managers of these lectures (I continue to call them lectures out of  courtesy to myself) often explained to me that it was quite useless to  begin properly until about half an hour after time. Often people were  still coming in three-quarters of an hour or even an hour after time.  Not that I objected to that, as some lecturers are said to do; it seemed  to me an agreeable break in the monotony; but as a characteristic of a  people mostly engaged in practical business, it struck me as curious and  interesting. I have grown accustomed to being the most unbusinesslike  person in any given company; and it gave me a sort of dizzy exaltation  to find I was not the most unpunctual person in that company. I was  afterwards told by many Americans that my impression was quite correct;  that American unpunctuality was really very prevalent, and extended to  much more important things. But at least I was not content to lump this  along with all sorts of contrary things that I did not happen to like,  and call it America. I am not sure of what it really means, but I rather  fancy that though it may seem the very reverse of the hustling, it has  the same origin as the hustling. The American is not punctual because he  is not punctilious. He is impulsive, and has an impulse to stay as well  as an impulse to go. For, after all, punctuality belongs to the same  order of ideas as punctuation; and there is no punctuation in  telegrams. The order of clocks and set hours which English business has  always observed is a good thing in its own way; indeed I think that in a  larger sense it is better than the other way. But it is better because  it is a protection against hustling, not a promotion of it. In other  words, it is better because it is more civilised; as a great Venetian  merchant prince clad in cloth of gold was more civilised; or an old  English merchant drinking port in an oak-panelled room was more  civilised; or a little French shopkeeper shutting up his shop to play  dominoes is more civilised. And the reason is that the American has the  romance of business and is monomaniac, while the Frenchman has the  romance of life and is sane. But the romance of business really is a  romance, and the Americans are really romantic about it. And that  romance, though it revolves round pork or petrol, is really like a  love-affair in this; that it involves not only rushing but also  lingering.    The American is too busy to have business habits. He is also too much in  earnest to have business rules. If we wish to understand him, we must  compare him not with the French shopkeeper when he plays dominoes, but  with the same French shopkeeper when he works the guns or mans the  trenches as a conscript soldier. Everybody used to the punctilious  Prussian standard of uniform and parade has noticed the roughness and  apparent laxity of the French soldier, the looseness of his clothes, the  unsightliness of his heavy knapsack, in short his inferiority in every  detail of the business of war except fighting. There he is much too  swift to be smart. He is much too practical to be precise. By a strange  illusion which can lift pork-packing almost to the level of patriotism,  the American has the same free rhythm in his romance of business. He  varies his conduct not to suit the clock but to suit the case. He gives  more time to more important and less time to less important things; and  he makes up his time-table as he goes along. Suppose he has three  appointments; the first, let us say, is some mere trifle of erecting a  tower twenty storeys high and exhibiting a sky-sign on the top of it;  the second is a business discussion about the possibility of printing  advertisements of soft drinks on the table-napkins at a restaurant; the  third is attending a conference to decide how the populace can be  prevented from using chewing-gum and the manufacturers can still manage  to sell it. He will be content merely to glance at the sky-sign as he  goes by in a trolley-car or an automobile; he will then settle down to  the discussion with his partner about the table-napkins, each speaker  indulging in long monologues in turn; a peculiarity of much American  conversation. Now if in the middle of one of these monologues, he  suddenly thinks that the vacant space of the waiter's shirt-front might  also be utilised to advertise the Gee Whiz Ginger Champagne, he will  instantly follow up the new idea in all its aspects and possibilities,  in an even longer monologue; and will never think of looking at his  watch while he is rapturously looking at his waiter. The consequence is  that he will come late into the great social movement against  chewing-gum, where an Englishman would probably have arrived at the  proper hour. But though the Englishman's conduct is more proper, it need  not be in all respects more practical. The Englishman's rules are better  for the business of life, but not necessarily for the life of business.  And it is true that for many of these Americans business is the  business of life. It is really also, as I have said, the romance of  life. We shall admire or deplore this spirit, accordingly as we are glad  to see trade irradiated with so much poetry, or sorry to see so much  poetry wasted on trade. But it does make many people happy, like any  other hobby; and one is disposed to add that it does fill their  imaginations like any other delusion. For the true criticism of all this  commercial romance would involve a criticism of this historic phase of  commerce. These people are building on the sand, though it shines like  gold, and for them like fairy gold; but the world will remember the  legend about fairy gold. Half the financial operations they follow deal  with things that do not even exist; for in that sense all finance is a  fairy tale. Many of them are buying and selling things that do nothing  but harm; but it does them good to buy and sell them."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#20)"],[1,"no available current    statistics on religious affiliation; all mosques and churches were    closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November    1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice    Languages:    Albanian (official - derived from Tosk dialect), Greek, Vlach,    Romani, Slavic dialects    Literacy:    definition: age 9 and over can read and write    total population: 86.5%    male: 93.3%    female: 79.5% (2003 est.)

The    government has taken measures to curb violent crime and reduce the    large grey economy. The economy is bolstered by annual remittances    from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Albanians residing in    Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit.    Agriculture, which accounts for about one-quarter of GDP, is held    back because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights,    and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy    shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to    Albania's poor business environment, which make it difficult to    attract and sustain foreign investment. The planned construction of    a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved transmission and    distribution facilities eventually will help relieve the energy    shortages. Also, the government is moving slowly to improve the poor    national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained    economic growth. On the positive side: growth was strong in 2003-06    and inflation is low and stable.
