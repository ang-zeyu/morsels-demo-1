Localities, in some of which it is very  plentiful, are, Caen Wood; Coombe Wood; Epping; Halton, Bucks; Bedford;  Aspley Wood, Beds; Plymouth, Teignmouth, Stowmarket, Dartmoor, Devonshire;  Oxford; Wiltshire; Colchester; St. Osyth; Tenterden; Faversham; Deal;  Canterbury. Very rare in north of England.           *       *       *       *       *    THE GREASY OR MARSH FRITILLARY. (_Melitaea Artemis._)    (Plate XI. fig. 4.)    The _black_ markings on the upper side of this butterfly closely approach  those of the last two species, but the interstices, instead of being filled  up with a _uniform fulvous tint_, as in those, are \"coloured in\" with  _several distinct shades_, some with _pale tawny yellow_, others with _deep  orange brown_. This latter tint forms a band parallel {138} to the outer  margin of each wing, the band on the front wings having a row of pale spots  in it; that on the hind wings a row of black spots. _Beneath_, the upper  wing has an appearance of the markings having been \"smudged\" together, and  a shining surface, as if it had been greased, whence the common name of the  insect; the hinder wings are like those of the two last, yellowish, banded  with brownish orange, the outer band of which bears a _series of black  spots each surrounded by a pale yellowish ring_.    The _front_ edge of the front wing is slightly _concave_ in its outline,  about the middle, whereas it is _convex_ in _Cinxia_ and _Athalia_.    The _caterpillar_ is black, with reddish brown legs. It is gregarious,  feeding under protection of a web upon the leaves of plantain, devils-bit  scabious, and some other plants.    The _chrysalis_ is drabbish, with darker spots, and is said to suspend  itself by the tail from the top of a tent-like structure made of blades of  grass spun together at the top.    The _butterfly_ appears in June (sometimes a little earlier or later), and  frequents marshy meadows, moist woods, &c., but is a very local insect,  abounding most in the south. The specimens, however, that I have seen from  the north, are much larger, brighter, and more distinctly marked than the  \"southerners.\" The nearest localities to London are, Hornsey, and Copthall  Wood at the top of Muswell Hill; West Wickham Wood, and {139} High-Beech  (Epping). It is also found near Brighton (plentifully); Carlisle; Durham;  Burton-on-Trent; York; Haverfordwest, S. W.; Cardiff, S. W.;  Weston-super-Mare; Bristol; and a great number of other places distributed  throughout the country. In Ireland at Ardrahan, co. Galway. Rare in  Scotland.           *       *       *       *       *    THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY FRITILLARY. (_Nemeobius Lucina._)    (Plate XI. fig. 5.)    Though this little insect bears the name of _Fritillary_, at the end of its  lengthy and important title, it really belongs to a family widely differing  from that of any of the true Fritillaries previously described, and it only  shared their name on account of its similarity in colour and markings.    The _caterpillar_ (Plate I. fig. 8), instead of being long and thorny like  those of the true Fritillaries, is _short, thick, and wood-louse shaped_.  Its colour is reddish brown, with tufts of hair of the same colour. It  feeds on the primrose.    The _chrysalis_ differs from that of the true Fritillaries as much as the  caterpillar does, being of the form, and suspended in the manner, shown at  fig. 25, Plate I.    The _butterfly_ is chequered on the upper surface with {140} tawny, and  dark brown or black. It appears in May and June, and again in August, being  found in woods, principally in the south, and its range is often confined  to a small spot hardly fifty yards in diameter, within which it may be  quite plentiful. The following are among its recorded  localities:--Carlisle; Lake District; West Yorkshire; Roche Abbey,  Yorkshire; Peterborough; Stowmarket; Pembury; Barnwell Wold, Northants;  Oxford; Blandford; Worcester; Gloucestershire; Bedfordshire; Epping; Coombe  Wood; Darenth Wood; Boxhill; Dorking; Brighton; Lewes; Worthing; Lyndhurst;  Teignmouth.    The _males_ of all the members of the family to which this butterfly  belongs, and of which this is the sole European representative--_the_  ERYCINIDAE--have only _four_ legs adapted for walking, whilst the _females_  have _six_.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BROWN HAIR-STREAK. (_Thecla Betulae._)    (Plate XII. fig. 1, Male; 1 _a_, Female.)    The genus to which this butterfly belongs, contains five British species,  elegant and interesting insects, though not gaily tinted. They are most  obviously distinguished from other small butterflies by the _tail-like_  projection on the lower edge of their hind wings (though one of their {141}  number, _T. Rubi_, has this very slightly developed). From each other they  are best distinguished by the characters on their under surface, where they  all bear a more or less distinct _hair_-like _streak_, whence their common  name--Hair-streak.    The Brown Hair-streak is the largest of the genus, measuring sometimes an  inch and two-thirds in expanse. The two sexes differ considerably on the  upper surface, the male being of a deep brown colour, slightly paler near  the middle of the front wing, while the female possesses on the front wing  a _large patch of clear orange_. Both sexes have several orange marks upon  the lower angles of the hind wings. Beneath, the general colour is tawny  orange with duller bands, and marked with one white line on the front wing,  and _two parallel white lines on the hind wings_.    The _caterpillar_ is green, marked obliquely with white; it feeds on the  birch and also on the sloe.    The _butterfly_ appears in August, continuing into September. It is  generally distributed through the south, but is by no means an abundant  insect. Mr. Stainton observes that it has a habit of \"flitting along in  hedges just in advance of the collector;\" but it is also found in oak woods  in company with the Purple Hair-streak.    Forty were taken in a season in woods near Henfield, Sussex. Other  localities are, Underbarrow Moss, Westmoreland; North Lancashire, common in  some parts; Preston; Valley of the Dovey, Montgomeryshire; {142} Cardiff,  S. W.; Barnwell Wold; Peterborough; Colchester; Epping; Darenth Wood;  Coombe Wood; Brighton; Tenterden; Winchester; Woolmer Forest, Hants;  Plymouth; Dartmoor; Wallingford, Berks; Ipswich; Dorsetshire; Norfolk;  Wiltshire; Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BLACK HAIR-STREAK. (_Thecla Pruni._)    (Plate XII. fig. 2.)    The upper side is very dark brown, sometimes almost black, and bearing near  the _hinder_ edge of the _hind wings_ a _few orange spots_. This character  will at once distinguish this from the next species (_W. Album_). On the  under side of the hind wing is a _broad band of orange_, having a _row of  black spots on its inner edge_.    The _caterpillar_ is green, with four rows of yellow spots. It feeds on the  sloe.    The _butterfly_ comes out about the end of June or in July. It is generally  a very rare insect, but is occasionally taken in great plenty in certain  spots. The Rev. W. Bree, writing to the _Zoologist_ from the neighbourhood  of Polebrook, North Hants, says, \"_Thecla Pruni_ is very uncertain in its  appearance. In 1837 it literally swarmed in Barnwell and Ashton Wolds; I do  not scruple to say that it would have been possible {143} to capture some  hundreds of them, had one been so disposed; for the last few years it has  appeared very sparingly indeed.\" It has also been found in the following  localities:--Overton Wood; Brington, Huntingdonshire; and Monks Wood,  Cambridgeshire.           *       *       *       *       *    THE WHITE LETTER HAIR-STREAK. (_Thecla W. Album._)    (Plate XII. fig. 3.)    This is very much like the last in appearance, and has often been mistaken  for it by inexperienced eyes. The _points_ of difference are--on the upper  side, the absence of the orange band at the hinder edge of the hind wings,  and the presence of a _bluish grey circumflex line at the inner angle_;  here also is sometimes a _small orange dot_;--beneath, the _orange band  forms a series of arches_, bounded on the edge nearest the root of the wing  _by a clear black line_ instead of the rounded black spots seen at this  part in _Pruni_.    The _caterpillar_, which feeds on the elm, is wood-louse shaped; pea-green,  barred with yellow; head black. May be beaten off elm trees in May.    The _butterfly_ appears in July, and is found in various situations,  sometimes flying high up round elm trees, sometimes descending to bramble  hedges, or fluttering {144} about in weedy fields a foot or two from the  ground. It was formerly a much rarer insect than at present, and now its  appearance in any given locality is a matter of much uncertainty. Mr. J. F.  Stephens writes as follows to the _Zoologist_:--    \"For eighteen years I possessed four bleached specimens only of _Thecla W.  Album_, having vainly endeavoured to procure others, when, in 1827, as  elsewhere recorded, I saw the insect at Ripley, not by dozens only, but by  scores of thousands! and although I frequented the same locality for  thirteen years subsequently, sometimes in the season for a month together,  I have not since seen a single specimen there; but in 1833 I caught one  specimen at Madingley Wood, near Cambridge.\"    Other localities:--Near Sheffield; Roche Abbey; York; Peterborough; near  Doncaster; Polebrook, Northants; Allesley, Warwickshire; Brington,  Huntingdonshire; Yaxley and Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire; Needwood Forest,  Staffordshire; Wolverston, near Ipswich; Chatham; Southgate, Middlesex;  West Wickham Wood; Epping; Bristol.           *       *       *       *       *    {145}    THE PURPLE HAIR-STREAK.(_Thecla Quercus._)    (Plate XII. fig. 4, Male; 4 _a_, Female.)    At once the commonest and the handsomest of the Hair-streaks,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33965"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 4, July, 1851 (#20)"],[1,"     *       *       *       *       *    THEODORE S. FAY--of whom the literary world has heard nothing for a long  time--has in the press of the Appletons, a poem, entitled _Ulric, or the  Voices_. Mr. Fay wrote good verses twenty years ago, and we shall see  whether he has lost his art.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. HART, of Philadelphia, has lately published, in a very handsome  style, several handbooks in the mechanic arts, which are much commended.  Among them are _The Manufacture of Steel_, by Frederick Overman; _The  Practical Dyer's Guide_; the _American Cotton Spinner's Guide_, and the  London _Year Book of Facts_.           *       *       *       *       *    We are soon to have a new book from THOMAS CARLYLE--a _Memoir of the  late John Sterling_, the \"Archaeus\" of _Blackwood_, and the author of  some of the finest compositions in recent English literature. Sterling,  it is known to his friends, from a devout believer became a skeptic, and  then a deist, pantheist, or perhaps an atheist, and finally, having done  all that he saw to do, deliberately shut himself up to die--wrote to his  friends what time he should leave the world, and on the very day, as if  by a mere volition, went to his place. All this is concealed or passed  over very lightly by Archdeacon Hare, his biographer, and Carlyle  therefore determines that the world shall have his friend's true  history. Among Sterling's most intimate correspondents was Ralph Waldo  Emerson, and even Carlyle cannot write his life, we suspect, without  having access to the extraordinary series of letters the poet sent to  his American friend--letters, we have reason to believe, that will  command a greater fame for him than all his published works have won,  letters that almost any man might die to be the author of.           *       *       *       *       *    The most noticeable event connected with literature in this country is  an arrangement entered into between a New-York publisher and THOMAS H.  BENTON, for the publication of the _Historical Memoirs of the Life and  Times_ of that eminent person. Mr. Benton is now about sixty-eight years  of age, and for half a century he has been an active participant in  affairs. He was thirty years a senator from Missouri, to which state he  removed some time before its admission to the Union. His name has been  connected with many great measures, and very few have exercised a more  powerful influence upon our institutions or policy. The increase of his  strength, as well as the increase of his fame, has been gradual but  regular. He has been from his youth a student. To every question which  has arrested his attention he has brought all the forces of his  understanding, and what he has acquired by incessant and painful labor  he has to an astonishing degree retained after the occasions which made  it necessary have passed. At a period much beyond the noon of other men,  he was still rising. He was of the age at which Cicero achieved his  highest triumphs, before he displayed the fullness and the perfection of  his powers, in several of the remarkable debates which have had relation  to our empire on the Pacific. With his extraordinary experience, his  faithful and particular memory, and wisdom which is master of his  temper, he is perhaps before every man of his time in the requisites for  such an undertaking as that which has occupied his leisure for many  years, and the chief portion of his time since he ceased to be a  senator. His work will probably make some five large octavo volumes, and  it may be believed that in fame, authority, and length of life, it will  equal the immortal production of Clarendon.           *       *       *       *       *    A new _Life of Mr. Jefferson_ is soon to be published by Mr. RANDALL,  who has been honorably distinguished in his connection with the  government of this state. The work will embrace a very interesting  sketch of the private life of Mr. Jefferson, by Mr. Thomas Jefferson  Randolph, the statesman's grandson and executor. Whatever we may think  of the abilities or the special services of Mr. Jefferson, we are of  that large number who regard his principles as altogether erroneous and  injurious, and his character with little respect. The time is coming in  which his history must be written, not by a maker of books, but by a  philosophical statesman. Every year the materials are becoming more  accessible. The writings of Adams and Hamilton, now in course of  publication, are important contributions to them. The looked-for  correspondence of Madison will serve largely for the same end; but Mr.  Jefferson's life cannot be thoroughly understood until the collection of  his papers in the possession of the government is carefully and  intelligibly studied. The four volumes of his letters printed by Mr.  Randolph, embrace but about eight hundred, but there were sold to the  government by his executor the enormous number at _forty-two thousand  letters_ and other documents, of which nearly sixteen thousand were  written or signed by Mr. Jefferson himself. A large proportion of these  papers are doubtless most important for the illustration of contemporary  French and American biography, but the whole of them should be read by  whoever attempts to write the history of the apostle of the radical  democracy in the United States.           *       *       *       *       *    A Memoir _with a selection of the unpublished writings of the late  Margaret Fuller, Countess d'Ossoli_, is announced as in preparation by  her friends RALPH WALDO EMERSON and WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING. The letters  of Margaret Fuller to the _Tribune_, would fill a large volume, and we  hope they will be reprinted with the collection of her private  correspondence and inedited essays. And some of her later critical  writings for the _Tribune_, in which the fame of more than one favorite  of certain coteries was assailed--will her editors have courage to  reproduce them? Pray you, gentlemen, consider that you propose bringing  Margaret Fuller herself from the sea, to speak again to us in her own  language; if the figure you present speak not as she spoke--all that she  would speak, regardless of your regards--it will not be believed that  you have commission for what you undertake.           *       *       *       *       *    The Rev. FREDERICK OGILBY, of Philadelphia, has in preparation a _Memoir  with selections from the Writings of the late Rev. John D. Ogilby,  D.D._, whose death at Paris was recently mentioned in these pages, and  of whose life and character we have received an eloquent portraiture in  the address delivered at his funeral by Bishop Doane.           *       *       *       *       *    An interesting article in the last _Southern Quarterly Review_ on the  life and writings of Edward Everett embraces some learned and elegant  philological discussions, in which Mr. Everett (of whom Dr. GILMAN, the  writer, is a very warm admirer) is convicted of the use of several  vulgarities, _e. g._ \"in our midst,\" \"in this connection,\" \"reliable,\"  &c. It is not often that such nice criticism is adventured in an  American review. By the way, we are surprised that in none of the  reviewals of Everett that have fallen under our notice has there been  even the suggestion of a parallel between the classical orator of  Harvard and Mr. Legare. A feeble eulogist in a Philadelphia magazine  compares him with Webster, which is merely ridiculous, as the two men  have nothing in common. It would have pleased us if Dr. Gilman had  weighed the merits of the illustrious Carolinian against those of the  New Englander most deserving of critical comparison with him.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. GILMORE SIMMS has in the press of a Charleston publisher a complete  collection of his poems--or rather a collection embracing all his  poetical compositions which so nearly meet the approval of his judgment  that he is willing to preserve them under his name. Mr. Simms is a  voluminous writer in verse as well as in prose, and we agree to an  opinion in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, that as a poet he has by  no means received justice from his contemporaries. Scarce any one in  this country has produced more fair verses, and with the fair is much  that is really beautiful. How much this proportion would be increased if  he would but labor! and not turn off sonnets as editors do paragraphs.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. OAKESSMITH has published in the _Tribune_, ten numbers of an  eloquently earnest performance under the title of _Woman and her Needs_.  She has none of the silly and maudlin extravagances of the \"Women's  Rights\" party, so called, and her work may safely be placed before those  of Mary Wolstoncraft and Margaret Fuller, for ability; but we regard all  these productions as uncalled for and injurious to the best interests of  the sex. A book of much more real value may be looked for in Catherine  Beecher's _True Remedy for Woman's Wrongs_, in the press of Phillips &  Sampson, of Boston. There is no woman of stronger intellect than Miss  Beecher's now writing in this country.           *       *       *       *       *    We learn with much regret that the Rev. Dr. THOMAS H. SMYTH, of South  Carolina, of whose many and various contributions to religious and  historical literature we gave some account in an earlier number of _The  International_, is dangerously ill in Italy, where his family have  recently joined him. Dr. Smyth, our advices state, had twice been  stricken with paralysis, and had been compelled entirely to forego all  his literary occupations.           *       *       *       *       *    The new novels of the last month have been numerous. The Harpers have  published _Caleb Field_, by the author of Mrs. Margaret Maitland;  _Eastbury_, by Harriet Drury; _The Heir of Wast-Wayland_, by Harriet  Drury; _Yeast, a Problem_,"]]]
