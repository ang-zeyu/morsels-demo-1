It seems, however, that Bonpland still maintains  a correspondence on scientific subjects with his old friend Humboldt,  which exhibits no falling off either in his tendencies or powers. On the  other hand, some suppose that he does not return to Europe because he  has taken an Indian wife, and finds himself happier in the wilderness in  her company.           *       *       *       *       *    An _official Russian account of operations in Hungary during_ 1849 has  been published at Berlin, in two volumes. It is by a colonel of the  general staff, and gives a detailed narrative of the entire doings of  the Russian forces in that memorable campaign. It casts a full light  upon the differences between Paskiewich and Haynau, and accuses the  latter, apparently not without reason, of the grossest mismanagement.  Even his famous march to Szegedin, which has passed for as brilliant and  well-planned as it was a successful manoeuvre, is not spared. Of  course, as regards matters of detail, this writer varies largely from  previous statements of the Austrians.           *       *       *       *       *    The second volume of Buelau's _Secret History and Mysterious Individuals_  has just been published by Brockhaus at Leipzic. The first volume was  published at the beginning of last year, and has been made known to  American readers by an interesting review of it in _Blackwood's  Magazine_, accompanied by copious extracts. It is undeniable that  Professor Buelau has had access to materials unknown to previous writers,  which he has used with laudable conscientiousness, to clear up many  obscure points in history, and to explain the motives of many persons  whose actions have been wondered at but not understood.           *       *       *       *       *    A work of some pretensions has just been published at Stuttgart, with  the title, _Italiens Zukunft_ (Italy's Future), by FR. KOeLLE, who gives  in it the fruit of seventeen years' residence in the country he treats  of. He begins with the original elements composing the Romanic Nations,  and goes on to consider the state of the country at the time of the  Revolution, the doings of the French, the Restoration, the cities,  commerce and navigation, the nobles, the peasantry, the Church,  monastical religious orders, the Jesuits, possibility of Church reform,  foreign influence, intellectual and scientific activity, Mazzini,  prospects in case of a future revolution, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    A German translation of selections from the works of Dr. CHANNING is  being published at Berlin. There are to be fifteen small volumes, of  which six or seven have already appeared. The _Grenzboten_ does not  think much of the author, but classes him with Schleiremacher and his  school. It says that Dr. Channing was a special favorite with women,  which it seems not to intend for a compliment.           *       *       *       *       *    M. FLOURENS, one of the perpetual secretaries of the French Academy of  Science, has published at Paris a collection of elegant and valuable  essays. They comprise a dissertation on George Cuvier, one on  Fontenelle, who is said to have best succeeded in casting on the  sciences the light of philosophy, and an examination of phrenology,  which M. Flourens discusses in the spirit of a disciple of Descartes and  Leibnitz.           *       *       *       *       *    JACQUES ARAGO, author of _Souvenirs d'un Aveugle_ (A Voyage Round the  World), &c., and brother of the astronomer and ex-minister, is one of  the most remarkable characters of Paris. He is stone _blind_, and has  been so for years; and yet he placed himself at the head of a band of  gold seekers, and conducted them to California. Recently he returned to  Paris, with little gold--indeed, with none at all--but in his voyage he  met some extraordinary adventures, and is about to communicate them to  the public in a volume. Jacques Arago is eminent in Paris not more for  his abilities as a man of letters than for his fastidiousness, devotion,  and success as a _roue_. If Love is sometimes blind, he is keen-sighted  for the sightless Arago, who boasts of having loved and been loved by  the most beautiful women of France.           *       *       *       *       *    The military history of the Napoleonic period has received a new  contribution in the _War of 1806 and 1807_, just published at Berlin, by  Col. Hoepfner, in two volumes. It is prepared from documents in the  Prussian archives, and illustrated with maps and plans of battles. Not  only does it add to our previous stock of information as to the military  operations in Germany during these eventful years, but it serves at the  same time as a history of the dissolution of that state which Frederic  the Great erected with such labor and perseverance. We have here, in  short, a picture of the downfall of the old Prussian military-system.           *       *       *       *       *    A new work on FRENCH HISTORY during the middle ages is _La France au  temps des Croisades_, by M. Vaublanc, which has lately made its  appearance at Paris, in four handsome octavo volumes. It is the fruit of  long and conscientious researches, and is written in a style of  seductive elegance. The author is no dry chronicler, or plodding  statician, but an artist, fully alive to the picturesqueness of his  topic. He carries his reader with him into the time and the scenes he  describes, and makes him a participant in the romantic and adventurous  life of the period. His book is thus as entertaining as it is  instructive.           *       *       *       *       *    A convenient book of reference for those who deal with the more  recondite and interesting questions of history is the _Statistique des  Peuples de l'Antiquite_, by M. Moreau de Jonnes, just published at  Paris. It is a work of great erudition and even originality. All sorts  of facts as to the social condition of the Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks,  Romans, and Gauls, may be gathered from it. Another new work of a  similar character is entitled _Du Probleme de la Misere et de sa  solution chez tous les Peuples Anciens et Modernes_, by M. Moreau  Christophe. Two volumes only have been published; a third is to follow.

The translator is M.A. Planche.           *       *       *       *       *    LOUIS VIARDOT has published in Paris a _Histoire des Arabes et des Mores  d'Espagne_. The excellent translator of _Don Quixote_ ought to produce a  striking work on this subject. The Count ALBERT DE CIRCOURT, too, has  published a new edition of his _Histoire des Mores Mudejares et des  Morisques; ou des Arabes d'Espagne sous la domination des Chretiens_.  Few topics in history have been until recently so much neglected as that  of the Moorish races in Europe, and a good deal of what has appeared on  the subject has been put together rather with a view to romantic effect  than with a proper respect for the responsibility of the historian;  though all Spanish history, Christian or Saracen, so abounds in romantic  interest that there is less excuse, as less necessity, for outstepping  the limits of truth, or giving undue prominence to the pathetic and  marvellous. From this defect of most of his predecessors, the work of  the Count de Circourt is in a great measure free. He has made a  dexterous and conscientious use of the materials within his reach, and  produced a work which unites to an unusual degree popularity of style  with matter of great novelty and interest. There are few spectacles in  modern times more attractive, or hitherto more imperfectly understood,  than the condition of the Spanish Moors, from the time when they became  a subject race, until their final expulsion from Europe in 1610. The  reason why more attention has not been given to this subject, must be  looked for in the fact that the expelled people were Mahometans, and  that they took refuge in Africa, not in Europe. They had not, as the  Protestants of France had, an England, Holland, and Germany to  sympathize with and shelter them;--though, taking it with all its  consequences, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was not a more  important event in history, or more pregnant with injury to the power  that enforced it, than the expulsion of the Moors from Spain. In folly  and perversity the last transaction has pre-eminence. Louis XIV. revoked  the Edict of Nantes, when he and his empire were at the summit of their  power; but Philip III. chose the luckless moment for expatriating the  most energetic and industrious of the inhabitants of Spain, when the  virtual acknowledgment of the independence of the Dutch, and the  concession to them of free trade to India, now assailed the prestige of  Spanish supremacy in Europe, and the commerce of Portugal, at that time  subject to Spain. From that hour the Peninsula declined with unexampled  rapidity; and though, in course of time, the progress of decay became  less marked, it was not finally arrested until two centuries after, when  the invasion of Napoleon re-awakened Spanish energies, and freed them  from the trammels which had impeded their development. Two centuries of  degradation are a heavy penalty for a nation to pay for pride and  intolerance; though not heavier than Spanish perfidy and cruelty to the  Moors most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#20)"],[1," of summer. Picks, shovels, rifles and  equipment also littered the landscape. Within our own area there were  likewise grim reminders of the fight. Here and there a limb protruded  through the wall of a newly cut trench, whilst in other places a piece  of biscuit box, or a rifle stuck into the earth muzzle down, both  bearing a name written in indelible pencil, indicated the last resting  place of some fallen comrade.    From No. 4 Post the observer could look down on \"The Farm.\" This was a  spot on the side of Chunuk Bair at the head of the Aghyl Dere, and had  formerly been cultivated. Now the Turk had commenced to entrench across  it, and was apparently working on it under cover of darkness. Beyond, to  the north, running up over the ridge (Kiretch Tepe Sirt) which bordered  the Gulf of Xeros, could be seen the whole of the line held by the 54th  Division and IX. Corps. The principal features were Hill 60 (Kaijak  Aghala), W Hills (Ismail Oglu Tepe), the village of Anafarta Sagir,  Chocolate Hill, the salt lake near Suvla Bay, and the bay itself with  the hill Lala Baba on its southern side.    The support of the Royal Navy was further manifested by the presence in  the Bay, behind the IX. Corps, of a cruiser and some smaller craft. From  one of these a sausage-shaped balloon occasionally ascended some few  hundred feet and afforded observation of the enemy's rear lines. A  glance down the ravine of the Chailak, between Bauchop's Hill and Table  Top, revealed H.M.S. \"Grafton,\" a second class cruiser, anchored about  two miles from the shore, whose 9.2 and 6-inch guns supplied a powerful  backing to the weak artillery of the Anzac Corps.    September 14th did not pass without loss. That morning witnessed the  deaths of Sergt. F. W. Ball and two other members as the result of  shrapnel fire. Later in the day another member succumbed to wounds.  Snipers also levied their toll of those moving about where the reserve  was situated. In consequence of this a move was made to a more sheltered  quarter and the unsafe dugouts were evacuated. On the 16th there were  two further fatal casualties.    During the next two days the men became more accustomed to their life  and surroundings. Those in the front trench had by far the easier time.  Those in support had to handle the pick and shovel in the works for the  improvement of the position. Digging was hard. The conglomerate-like  composition of the soil resisted the shovels and turned the points of  the picks. Recourse was had to the Navy, who supplied a small forge for  the sharpening of the latter. Thus to other noises was added that of the  hammer on anvil. The reserves were utilised by the Brigade and Division  for works in rear of the position. The demands of the Engineers seemed  never ending and were often in excess of the number of men available.  This caused considerable confusion and irritation followed by requests  from the Division for explanations as to labour not being forthcoming.  These requests had usually to be met by lengthy and involved \"returns\"  which very few people understood and which served no useful purpose  except to temporarily alleviate the strain. As a rule the exasperating  situation was restored next day. Nor was the necessity for the work at  first apparent to the men. They thought they came to fight with the  bullet and bayonet only. But enlightenment came and one experienced  miner voiced it, after a solid week on excavating, when he said \"I have  just discovered I have been a blanky soldier all my life.\"    [Illustration: VIEW FROM BABY 700.

A  few had \"bivies\" excavated in the walls of the trenches, but most men  had only the floor of the trench upon which to lie. Here, clothed in  their overcoats and wrapped in their single blankets, they  slumbered--only to be rudely awakened now and then by the pressure on  some part of their anatomy of the feet of a passenger to or from the  front line. On dark nights careless senior officers when going their  rounds were treated to loud and homely descriptions of themselves which  in daylight and cold blood would scarcely even have been whispered to a  comrade. In the front trench, where the garrison was relieved by the  supports every 24 hours, sleep was, theoretically, not to be thought of.  However, the normal man felt that at some time during the 24 hours it  was good to close his tired eyes--if only for a few minutes. After all,  a seat on a sandbag, and a good solid wall against which to rest one's  back, did give a little comfort. The officer in making his tour of  inspection would ask a question here and there and occasionally mount  the firestep and talk with the sentry. Usually the noise of his approach  was sufficient to ensure alertness on his entering a bay that was  manned, but, now and then, stertorous breathing and the attitude of the  sentry, as revealed by his silhouette against the light of the moon or  stars, would indicate that the flesh had momentarily vanquished the  spirit. The touch of a hand was sufficient to restore wakefulness.  Apropos of this, a senior officer, rather irritable at the moment, once  touched an apparently sleeping sentry on the knee, at the same time  asking the question \"Look here! Are you asleep?\" He was rather  confounded at receiving the undoubtedly truthful answer \"No, Sir.\"    At 4.30 p.m. on the 18th September, the Turks suddenly commenced a heavy  bombardment of the position and back areas. Shrapnel and high explosive  were supported by rifle and machine-gun fire at a rapid rate. A glance  in the direction of Suvla revealed a sight resembling an exhibition of  gigantic chrysanthemums--the white smoke of bursting shrapnel, before  dissipating, closely resembling that flower in form. Here and there  columns of black smoke and earth would suddenly spring into existence  indicating the arrival and explosion of large calibre shells. Everything  pointed to some important move on the part of the enemy. Orders were  instantly given for the garrison to \"stand to\" and the reserves to move  up in close support. These orders were obeyed with alacrity. All ranks  were eager and the answer to the oft-repeated question, \"What are we  here for?\" seemed to be at hand. Rifles and revolvers were loaded,  grenades served out, and the New Zealanders manned their machine guns.  Within a minute or two of the opening of the bombardment our own guns  commenced to reply on the enemy trenches. For a time the noise was  deafening--a regular babel of sounds through which, in spite of the  crashing of shells, could be distinguished the tapping of machine guns  and the swishing of bullets in flight. However, the enemy stuck to  cover. Whether or not he intended to make a demonstration only is not  clear, but information received later from Suvla showed that a few  officers had jumped on to the parapet and waved their swords in the  apparent vain attempt to lead their men, who, whilst shouting loudly,  were reluctant to leave the safety of the earthworks. In half an hour  the firing died down, and normal conditions were resumed. The Battalion  had suffered no casualties and had demonstrated its steadiness under  sustained fire.    On Sunday, 19th September, a party consisting of one officer from each  battalion of the Brigade made a tour of inspection of the Lone Pine  position and the trenches running down to Chatham's Post on the extreme  right. Additional parties went on the 21st and 23rd. These tours were  arranged for instructional purposes, and were valuable aids to acquiring  a knowledge of trench warfare methods. Further, they gave the  participants many ideas on the use that could be made of ground and of  the wonders performed by the troops who made the original landing on  25th April.    At dusk the Maoris assembled just below the Apex. Divine service was  conducted by their own chaplain in the Maori tongue, but in accordance  with the Church of England liturgy and with the orthodox intoning. The  scene was an impressive one, and will not easily be forgotten by those  who witnessed it. Other gatherings for worship were held when  circumstances permitted, but, as a rule, senior officers objected to  their men gathering in numbers when so few spots in the limited area  behind the lines were not exposed to shell fire. Chaplains, therefore,  had to visit the individual members of their flocks wherever they could  find them. This meant much hill climbing and the running of considerable  risk from gun and rifle fire. Many a padre acquired great merit by his  unselfishness and disregard of danger. Should casualties have occurred  during the day, small knots of people might be seen at night down near  the beach, or on some other exposed slope, reverently interring a  comrade who had fallen. Here the padres performed the last offices for  the dead.    Early in the morning of the 20th occurred one of those incidents which  have often been narrated but seldom authenticated. Private G. J. Owen,  whilst standing on the firestep observing, felt a blow on the chest. On  an examination of his clothing it was found that a bullet had penetrated  his greatcoat and jacket, and also a wallet in his jacket pocket, and  finally spent itself in the centre of a small Bible that he was in the  habit of carrying with him. Owen was quite uninjured and has, since his  return to Australia, published his own story.    This day the Pinnacle was heavily shelled by our 6-inch howitzers in an  attempt to demolish the Blockhouse and a small redoubt behind it. Both  works were looked upon as serious obstacles to possible "]]]
