In the north choir-aisle at  Westminster, the Shield (now mutilated) of the Emperor FREDERICK II. is  boldly sculptured by an heraldic artist of the time of our HENRY III.,  No. 200; here the Eagle had one head only. The German Emperors naturally  adopted the Eagle for their heraldic Ensign, in support of their claim  to be successors to the Roman Cæsars; and the Russian Czars, with the  same motive, have also assumed the same ensign. The Eagle having two  heads, which severally look to the dexter and the sinister, as in No.  201, typified a rule that claimed to extend over both the Eastern and  the Western Empires; as the Eagle with a single head, No. 202, might be  considered to have a less comprehensive signification. The Eagles of the  Princes of Germany are frequently to be found, blazoned for them, in  England.      [Illustration: No. 200.--In Westminster Abbey.]      [Illustration: No. 201.--Imperial Eagle.]      [Illustration: No. 202.--Royal Eagle.]      [Illustration: No. 203.--Cornwall.]      [Illustration: No. 204.--Seal of Euphemia Leslie.]    RICHARD, the second son of King JOHN, in the year 1256 was elected King  of Germany (he is generally styled \"King of the Romans\"), when he bore  the Eagle of the Empire: but the only Seals of this Prince that are  known to exist in England display the Shield of his English Earldom of  Cornwall, No. 140. His Son EDMUND, who succeeded to his father's  Earldom, on his Seals has represented an _Eagle bearing in its beak his  Shield of Cornwall_, as in No. 203: this is a peculiarly interesting  example of an heraldic usage of striking significance, and it also  illustrates the early existence of the sentiment which at a later period  led to the adoption of \"Supporters\" to Shields of Arms. In the early  Heraldry of Scotland, a single displayed Eagle is occasionally found  supporting an armorial Shield; as in the Seals of ALEXANDER STEWARD,  Earl of MENTEITH, A.D. 1296, and WILLIAM, Earl of DOUGLAS and MAR, A.D.  1378 (Seton's \"Scottish Heraldry,\" Plates VIII. and XII.): sometimes  also, as Mr. Seton has observed, \"the Eagle's breast is charged with  more than one Shield, as in the case of the Seals of MARGARET STEWART,  Countess of ANGUS (1366), and EUPHEMIA LESLIE, Countess of ROSS (1381),  on both of which _three_ escutcheons make their appearance\" (\"Scottish  Heraldry,\" p. 268, and Plate XII., No. 5): in No. 204 I give a woodcut  of this interesting composition; the Shields are, to the dexter,  LESLIE--_Arg., on a bend az., three buckles or_; in the centre, the Arms  of the Earl of ROSS--_Gu., three Lions rampant arg., within a tressure_;  and, to the sinister, CUMMIN--_Az., three garbs or_. The Imperial Eagle  is sometimes represented crowned; the heads also in some examples are  encircled with a _nimbus_ or glory, as in No. 212. I must add that in  the Heraldry of the English Peerage the Imperial Eagle still supports  the Shields of some few Peers of different ranks; as, for example, that  of Baron METHUEN.      [Illustration: No. 205.--Shield of Piers Gaveston.]      [Illustration: No. 206.--Montacute and Monthermer.]    PIERS GAVESTON, who was created Earl of CORNWALL by EDWARD II.,  bore--_Vert, six Eaglets or_, No. 205, (E. 2 and York stained glass): on  his Seal, however, the number of the Eaglets is reduced to _three_.  Another early example is the Shield of that gallant and persevering  knight, RALPH DE MONTHERMER--_Or, an Eagle displayed vert_, No. 206, who  became Earl of GLOUCESTER in right of his wife, JOAN, daughter of  EDWARD I., and widow of GILBERT DE CLARE, the \"Red Earl\"; this green  Eagle of Monthermer long held a place of high distinction in the  mediæval Heraldry of England, marshalled on the Shields of the Earls of  SALISBURY and WARWICK; in which, as in the example, No. 206, the Eagle  of Monthermer is quartered with the coat of Montacute, No. 20 (page 17).  The Eagle of early Heraldry was sometimes blazoned as an \"_Erne_,\"[4]  and sometimes as an \"_Alerion_,\" WILLIAM D'ERNFORD (H. 3) bears--_Sa.,  an Erne displayed arg._: and, at the same period WM. DE ERNFIELD bears a  pair of Erne's or Eagle's Wings, called a \"_Vol_,\" No. 207. From Shields  of the fourteenth century which bear Eagles, and are blazoned in the  Roll of Edward II., I select the following small group as good  examples:--Sir WM. DE MONGOMERIE--_Or, an Eagle displayed az._: Sir  NICHOLAS DE ETONE--_Gu., a Chevron between three Eaglets arg._: Sir JOHN  DE CHARLESTONE--_Arg., on a Chevron vert three Eaglets or_: Sir PHILIP  DE VERLEY--_Or, a Bend gu., between six Eaglets sa._: Sir JOHN DE LA  MERE--_Arg., on a Bend az. three Eaglets or_, No. 209: a Shield bearing  a Bend charged with three Eagles, but with different tinctures, No. 88,  I have shown to have been the Arms of the Grandisons.        [Footnote 4: Query if this is not really a herne or      heron.--A. C. F.-D.]      [Illustration: No. 207.--A Vol.]      [Illustration: No. 209.--De la Mere.]    Eagles, under their name of \"_Alerions_\" (which early Heralds  represented without feet and beaks), are blazoned in the same  disposition as in No. 209, in the Arms of the Duchy of LORRAINE,--_Or,  on a Bend gu. three alerions arg._: and this device the Dukes of  Lorraine _are said_ to have borne in commemoration of an exploit of  their famous ancestor, GODFREY DE BOLOGNE, _who is also said_, when  \"shooting against David's tower in Jerusalem,\" to have \"broched upon his  arrow three footless birds called alerions.\" \"It is impossible,\" remarks  Mr. Planché upon this legend, \"now to ascertain who broached this  wonderful story; but it is perfectly evident that the narrator was the  party who drew the long bow, and not the noble GODFREY.\" Mr. Planché  adds, that the Alerions of Lorraine may indicate an alliance with the  Imperial House; and he directs attention to \"a similarity in sound  between 'Alerion' and 'Lorraine,'\" and also to a singular Anagram  produced by the letters ALERION and LORAINE, which are the same  (\"Pursuivant of Arms,\" p. 87). The Arms of Lorraine are still borne by  the Emperor of AUSTRIA: and in England they were quartered by Queen  MARGARET of Anjou.      [Illustration: No. 210.--Shield at St. Albans.]      [Illustration: No. 211.--The Austrian Eagle.]    The Roll of Edward II. gives also for Sir HUGH DE BILBESWORTH these  arms--_Az., three Eagles displayed or_. A similar Shield, the tinctures  changed to--_Arg., three Eagles displayed gu., armed or_, was borne by  ROBERT DE EGLESFIELD, Confessor to PHILIPPA of Hainault, Queen of  EDWARD III., who in the year 1340 founded Queen's College, Oxford: this  Shield of the Founder is borne by the College. One of the Shields in the  Chantry of Abbot RAMRYGE in St. Albans Abbey Church bears the same  charges--_three eagles displayed_, No. 210: the drawing of the eagle in  this Shield is remarkable, and the form of the Shield itself is  singularly characteristic of the close of the fifteenth century. Another  Shield in the same monument bears a single Eagle, drawn in the same  manner, and sculptured with extraordinary spirit. The German Heralds,  and also their brethren of France, delight in exaggerations of what I  may distinguish as the Westminster Eagle, No. 200. The Austrian Eagle,  besides having both its heads crowned, has a large Imperial Crown placed  between and above the two heads, as in No. 211. The Imperial Eagle (Holy  Roman Empire) sometimes has a nimbus or glory about each head, which  dignified accessory is represented by a circular line, as in No. 212. In  some examples of Eagles, as well in our own Heraldry as in that of  continental countries, the wings are represented as _erect_ (the more  usual form in England), and having the tips of all the principal  feathers pointing upwards, as in No. 213. The Eagle borne as the Ensign  of Imperial FRANCE was represented grasping a thunderbolt, in an  attitude of vigilance, having its wings displayed, but with the tips of  the feathers drooping, as they would be in the living bird; No. 214.      [Illustration: No. 212.--Imperial Eagle, with Nimbus.]      [Illustration: No. 213.--Eagle \"displayed,\" with Wings erect.]    EDWARD III., as a Second Crest, bore an Eagle. An Eagle also was borne  for his Crest, as the imperial bird was displayed upon his Shield (No.  206), by Earl RALPH DE MONTHERMER. In the more recent Heraldry of  England, the Eagle is a Supporter to the Shields of the Earls of  CLARENDON, COVENTRY, and MALMESBURY; the Viscounts BOLINGBROKE and ST.  VINCENT; and the Barons HEYTESBURY, RADSTOCK, WYNFORD, and others.  Eagles also and Demi-Eagles are borne as Crests in the English Heraldry  of our own day.      [Illustration: No. 214.--French Imperial Eagle.]    In drawing our heraldic Eagles, we can scarcely improve upon some of the  examples in which early English Heralds expressed their ideas of the  king of birds.

Lee (#20)"],[1," men who could get leave came to look on, and  from all the surrounding country the people, old and young, ladies and  children, came in every pattern of vehicle and on horseback, to see  twenty thousand of that \"incomparable infantry\" of the Army of Northern  Virginia pass in review before their great commander.    The General was mounted on Traveller, looking very proud of his master,  who had on sash and sword, which he very rarely wore, a pair of new  cavalry gauntlets, and, I think, a new hat. At any rate, he looked  unusually fine, and sat his horse like a perfect picture of grace and  power. The infantry was drawn up in column by divisions, with their  bright muskets all glittering in the sun, their battle-flags standing  straight out before the breeze, and their bands playing, awaiting the  inspection of the General, before they broke into column by companies  and marched past him in review. When all was ready, General Hill  and staff rode up to General Lee, and the two generals, with their  respective staffs, galloped around front and rear of each of the three  divisions standing motionless on the plain. As the cavalcade reached the  head of each division, its commanding officer joined in and followed  as far as the next division, so that there was a continual infusion  of fresh groups into the original one all along the lines. Traveller  started with a long lope, and never changed his stride. His rider sat  erect and calm, not noticing anything but the gray lines of men whom he  knew so well. The pace was very fast, as there were nine good miles to  go, and the escort began to become less and less, dropping out one by  one from different causes as Traveller raced along without check. When  the General drew up, after this nine-mile gallop, under the standard at  the reviewing-stand, flushed with the exercise as well as with pride  in his brave men, he raised his hat and saluted. Then arose a shout of  applause and admiration from the entire assemblage, the memory of which  to this day moistens the eye of every old soldier. The corps was then  passed in review at a quick-step, company front. It was a most imposing  sight. After it was all over, my father rode up to several carriages  whose occupants he knew and gladdened them by a smile, a word, or a  shake of the hand. He found several of us young officers with some  pretty cousins of his from Richmond, and he was very bright and  cheerful, joking us young people about each other. His letters to my  mother and sister this summer and fall help to give an insight into his  thoughts and feelings. On July 15th, from Bunker Hill, in a letter to  his wife, he says:    \"...The army has returned to Virginia. Its return is rather sooner than  I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished much of what I  proposed on leaving the Rappahannock--namely, relieving the valley of  the presence of the enemy and drawing his army north of the Potomac--I  determined to recross the latter river. The enemy, after centering his  forces in our front, began to fortify himself in his position and  bring up his troops, militia, etc.--and those around Washington and  Alexandria. This gave him enormous odds. It also circumscribed our  limits for procuring subsistence for men and animals, which, with the  uncertain state of the river, rendered it hazardous for us to continue  on the north side. It has been raining a great deal since we first  crossed the Potomac, making the roads horrid and embarrassing our  operations. The night we recrossed it rained terribly, yet we got all  over safe, save such vehicles as broke down on the road from the mud,  rocks, etc. We are all well. I hope we will yet be able to damage our  adversaries when they meet us. That it should be so, we must implore the  forgiveness of God for our sins, and the continuance of His blessings.  There is nothing but His almighty power that can sustain us. God bless  you all....\"    Later, July 26th, he writes from Camp Culpeper:    \"...After crossing the Potomac, finding that the Shenandoah was six feet  above the fording-stage, and, having waited for a week for it to fall,  so that I might cross into Loudoun, fearing that the enemy might take  advantage of our position and move upon Richmond, I determined to ascend  the Valley and cross into Culpeper. Two corps are here with me. The  third passed Thornton's Gap, and I hope will be in striking distance  to-morrow. The army has laboured hard, endured much, and behaved nobly.  It has accomplished all that could be reasonably expected. It ought not  to have been expected to perform impossibilities, or to have fulfilled  the anticipations of the thoughtless and unreasonable.\"    On August 2d, from the same camp, he again writes to my mother:    \"...I have heard of some doctor having reached Richmond, who had seen  our son at Fortress Monroe. He said that his wound is improving, and  that he himself was well and walking about on crutches. The exchange of  prisoners that had been going on has, for some cause, been suspended,  owing to some crotchet or other, but I hope will soon be resumed, and  that we shall have him back soon. The armies are in such close proximity  that frequent collisions are common along the outposts. Yesterday the  enemy laid down two or three pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock  and crossed his cavalry, with a big force of his infantry. It looked at  first as if it were the advance of his army, and, as I had not intended  to deliver battle, I directed our cavalry to retire slowly before them  and to check their too rapid pursuit. Finding, later in the day, that  their army was not following, I ordered out the infantry and drove them  back to the river. I suppose they intended to push on to Richmond  by this or some other route. I trust, however, they will never reach  there....\"    On August 23d, from the camp near Orange Court House, General Lee writes  to Mrs. Lee:    \"...My camp is near Mr. Erasmus Taylor's house, who has been very kind  in contributing to our comfort. His wife sends us every day, buttermilk,  loaf bread, ice, and such vegetables as she has. I cannot get her to  desist, thought I have made two special visits to that effect. All the  brides have come on a visit to the army: Mrs. Ewell, Mrs. Walker, Mrs.  Heth, etc. General Meade's army is north of the Rappahannock along the  Orange and Alexandria Railroad. He is very quiet....\"    \"September 4, 1863.    \"...You see I am still here. When I wrote last, the indications were  that the enemy would move against us any day; but this past week he has  been very quiet, and seems at present to continue so. I was out looking  at him yesterday, from Clarke's Mountain. He has spread himself over a  large surface and looks immense....\"    And on September 18th, from the same camp:    \"...The enemy state that they have heard of a great reduction in our  forces here, and are now going to drive us back to Richmond. I trust  they will not succeed; but our hope and our refuge is in our merciful  Father in Heaven....\"    On October 9th, the Army of Northern Virginia was put in motion, and  wa pushed around Meade's right. Meade was gradually forced back to a  position near the old battlefield at Manassas. Although we had hard  marching, much skirmishing, and several severe fights between the  cavalry of both armies, nothing permanent was accomplished, and in about  ten days we were back on our old lines. In a letter of October 19, 1863,  to his wife, my father says:    \"...I have returned to the Rappahannock. I did not pursue with the main  army beyond Bristoe or Broad Run. Our advance went as far as Bull  Run, where the enemy was entrenched, extending his right as far as  'Chantilly,' in the yard of which he was building a redoubt. I could  have thrown him farther back, but saw no chance of bringing him to  battle, and it would only have served to fatigue our troops by advancing  farther. I should certainly have endeavored to throw them north of the  Potomac; but thousands were barefooted, thousands with fragments of  shoes, and all without overcoats, blankets, or warm clothing. I could  not bear to expose them to certain suffering and an uncertain issue....\"    On October 25th, from \"Camp Rappahannock,\" he writes again to my mother:    \"...I moved yesterday into a nice pine thicket, and Perry is to-day  engaged in constructing a chimney in front of my tent, which will make  it warm and comfortable. I have no idea when Fitzhugh [his son, Major  General Fitzhugh Lee] will be exchanged. The Federal authorities still  resist all exchanges, because they think it is to our interest to  make them. Any desire expressed on our part for the exchange of any  individual magnifies the difficulty, as they at once think some great  benefit is to result to us from it. His detention is very grievous to  me, and, besides, I want his services. I am glad you have some socks for  the army. Send them to me. They will come safely. Tell the girls [his  daughters] to send all they can. I wish they could make some shoes, too.  We have thousands of barefooted men. There is no news. General Meade, I  believe, is repairing the railroad, and I presume will come on again.  If I could only get some shoes and clothes for the men, I would save him  the trouble....\"    One can see from these letters of my father how deeply he felt for  the sufferings of his soldiers, and how his plans were hindered by  inadequate supplies of food and clothing. I heard him constantly allude  to these troubles; indeed, they seemed never absent from his mind.
