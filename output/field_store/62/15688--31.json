(Ant. 2)  Hope flits about never-wearying wings;  Profit to some, to some light loves she brings,  But no man knoweth how her gifts may turn,  Till 'neath his feet the treacherous ashes burn.  Sure 'twas a sage inspired that spake this word;            _If evil good appear_            _To any, Fate is near_;  And brief the respite from her flaming sword.              Hither comes in angry mood            Haemon, latest of thy brood;            Is it for his bride he's grieved,            Or her marriage-bed deceived,            Doth he make his mourn for thee,            Maid forlorn, Antigone?  [Enter HAEMON]    CREON  Soon shall we know, better than seer can tell.  Learning may fixed decree anent thy bride,  Thou mean'st not, son, to rave against thy sire?  Know'st not whate'er we do is done in love?    HAEMON  O father, I am thine, and I will take  Thy wisdom as the helm to steer withal.  Therefore no wedlock shall by me be held  More precious than thy loving goverance.    CREON  Well spoken:  so right-minded sons should feel,  In all deferring to a father's will.  For 'tis the hope of parents they may rear  A brood of sons submissive, keen to avenge  Their father's wrongs, and count his friends their own.  But who begets unprofitable sons,  He verily breeds trouble for himself,  And for his foes much laughter.  Son, be warned  And let no woman fool away thy wits.  Ill fares the husband mated with a shrew,  And her embraces very soon wax cold.  For what can wound so surely to the quick  As a false friend?  So spue and cast her off,  Bid her go find a husband with the dead.  For since I caught her openly rebelling,  Of all my subjects the one malcontent,  I will not prove a traitor to the State.  She surely dies.  Go, let her, if she will,  Appeal to Zeus the God of Kindred, for  If thus I nurse rebellion in my house,  Shall not I foster mutiny without?  For whoso rules his household worthily,  Will prove in civic matters no less wise.  But he who overbears the laws, or thinks  To overrule his rulers, such as one  I never will allow.  Whome'er the State  Appoints must be obeyed in everything,  But small and great, just and unjust alike.  I warrant such a one in either case  Would shine, as King or subject; such a man  Would in the storm of battle stand his ground,  A comrade leal and true; but Anarchy--  What evils are not wrought by Anarchy!  She ruins States, and overthrows the home,  She dissipates and routs the embattled host;  While discipline preserves the ordered ranks.  Therefore we must maintain authority  And yield to title to a woman's will.  Better, if needs be, men should cast us out  Than hear it said, a woman proved his match.    CHORUS  To me, unless old age have dulled wits,  Thy words appear both reasonable and wise.    HAEMON  Father, the gods implant in mortal men  Reason, the choicest gift bestowed by heaven.  'Tis not for me to say thou errest, nor  Would I arraign thy wisdom, if I could;  And yet wise thoughts may come to other men  And, as thy son, it falls to me to mark  The acts, the words, the comments of the crowd.  The commons stand in terror of thy frown,  And dare not utter aught that might offend,  But I can overhear their muttered plaints,  Know how the people mourn this maiden doomed  For noblest deeds to die the worst of deaths.  When her own brother slain in battle lay  Unsepulchered, she suffered not his corse  To lie for carrion birds and dogs to maul:  Should not her name (they cry) be writ in gold?  Such the low murmurings that reach my ear.  O father, nothing is by me more prized  Than thy well-being, for what higher good  Can children covet than their sire's fair fame,  As fathers too take pride in glorious sons?  Therefore, my father, cling not to one mood,  And deemed not thou art right, all others wrong.  For whoso thinks that wisdom dwells with him,  That he alone can speak or think aright,  Such oracles are empty breath when tried.  The wisest man will let himself be swayed  By others' wisdom and relax in time.  See how the trees beside a stream in flood  Save, if they yield to force, each spray unharmed,  But by resisting perish root and branch.  The mariner who keeps his mainsheet taut,  And will not slacken in the gale, is like  To sail with thwarts reversed, keel uppermost.  Relent then and repent thee of thy wrath;  For, if one young in years may claim some sense,  I'll say 'tis best of all to be endowed  With absolute wisdom; but, if that's denied,  (And nature takes not readily that ply)  Next wise is he who lists to sage advice.    CHORUS  If he says aught in season, heed him, King.  (To HAEMON)  Heed thou thy sire too; both have spoken well.    CREON  What, would you have us at our age be schooled,  Lessoned in prudence by a beardless boy?    HAEMON  I plead for justice, father, nothing more.  Weigh me upon my merit, not my years.    CREON  Strange merit this to sanction lawlessness!    HAEMON  For evil-doers I would urge no plea.    CREON  Is not this maid an arrant law-breaker?    HAEMON  The Theban commons with one voice say, No.    CREON  What, shall the mob dictate my policy?    HAEMON  'Tis thou, methinks, who speakest like a boy.    CREON  Am I to rule for others, or myself?    HAEMON  A State for one man is no State at all.    CREON  The State is his who rules it, so 'tis held.    HAEMON  As monarch of a desert thou wouldst shine.    CREON  This boy, methinks, maintains the woman's cause.    HAEMON  If thou be'st woman, yes.  My thought's for thee.    CREON  O reprobate, would'st wrangle with thy sire?    HAEMON  Because I see thee wrongfully perverse.    CREON  And am I wrong, if I maintain my rights?    HAEMON  Talk not of rights; thou spurn'st the due of Heaven    CREON  O heart corrupt, a woman's minion thou!    HAEMON  Slave to dishonor thou wilt never find me.    CREON  Thy speech at least was all a plea for her.    HAEMON  And thee and me, and for the gods below.    CREON  Living the maid shall never be thy bride.    HAEMON  So she shall die, but one will die with her.    CREON  Hast come to such a pass as threaten me?    HAEMON  What threat is this, vain counsels to reprove?    CREON  Vain fool to instruct thy betters; thou shall rue it.    HAEMON  Wert not my father, I had said thou err'st.    CREON  Play not the spaniel, thou a woman's slave.    HAEMON  When thou dost speak, must no man make reply?    CREON  This passes bounds.  By heaven, thou shalt not rate  And jeer and flout me with impunity.  Off with the hateful thing that she may die  At once, beside her bridegroom, in his sight.    HAEMON  Think not that in my sight the maid shall die,  Or by my side; never shalt thou again  Behold my face hereafter.  Go, consort  With friends who like a madman for their mate.  [Exit HAEMON]    CHORUS  Thy son has gone, my liege, in angry haste.  Fell is the wrath of youth beneath a smart.    CREON  Let him go vent his fury like a fiend:  These sisters twain he shall not save from death.    CHORUS  Surely, thou meanest not to slay them both?    CREON  I stand corrected; only her who touched  The body.    CHORUS            And what death is she to die?    CREON  She shall be taken to some desert place  By man untrod, and in a rock-hewn cave,  With food no more than to avoid the taint  That homicide might bring on all the State,  Buried alive.  There let her call in aid  The King of Death, the one god she reveres,  Or learn too late a lesson learnt at last:  'Tis labor lost, to reverence the dead.    CHORUS  (Str.)  Love resistless in fight, all yield at a glance of thine eye,  Love who pillowed all night on a maiden's cheek dost lie,  Over the upland holds.  Shall mortals not yield to thee?    (Ant).  Mad are thy subjects all, and even the wisest heart  Straight to folly will fall, at a touch of thy poisoned dart.  Thou didst kindle the strife, this feud of kinsman with kin,  By the eyes of a winsome wife, and the yearning her heart to win.  For as her consort still, enthroned with Justice above,  Thou bendest man to thy will, O all invincible Love.              Lo I myself am borne aside,            From Justice, as I view this bride.            (O sight an eye in tears to drown)            Antigone, so young, so fair,                 Thus hurried down            Death's bower with the dead to share.    ANTIGONE  (Str. 1)  Friends, countrymen, my last farewell I make;            My journey's done.  One last fond, lingering, longing look I take            At the bright sun.  For Death who puts to sleep both young and old            Hales my young life,  And beckons me to Acheron's dark fold,            An unwed wife.  No youths have sung the marriage song for me,            My bridal bed  No maids have strewn with flowers from the lea,            'Tis Death I wed.    CHORUS            But bethink thee, thou art sped,            Great and glorious, to the dead.            Thou the sword's edge hast not tasted,            No disease thy frame hath wasted.            Freely thou alone shalt go            Living to the dead below.    ANTIGONE  (Ant. 1)  Nay, but the piteous tale I've heard men tell       Of Tantalus' doomed child,  Chained upon Siphylus' high rocky fell,       That clung like ivy wild,  Drenched by the pelting rain and whirling snow,       Left there to pine,  While on her frozen breast the tears aye flow--       Her fate is mine.    CHORUS            She was sprung of gods, divine,            Mortals we of mortal line.            Like renown with gods to gain            Recompenses all thy pain.            Take this solace to thy tomb            Hers in life and death thy doom.    ANTIGONE  (Str. 2)  Alack, alack!  Ye mock me.  Is it meet       Thus to insult me living, to my face?  Cease, by our country's altars I entreat,       Ye lordly rulers of a lordly race.

But the  duke would not meet Mr. Pitt till the _word_ was explained; and this  important negotiation was broken off by not explaining a simple word  which appeared to require no explanation.    There is nothing more fatal in language than to wander from the popular  acceptation of words; and yet this popular sense cannot always accord  with precision of ideas, for it is itself subject to great changes.    Another source, therefore, of the abuse of words, is that mutability to  which, in the course of time, the verbal edifice, as well as more  substantial ones, is doomed. A familiar instance presents itself in the  titles of _tyrant_, _parasite_, and _sophist_, originally honourable  distinctions. The abuses of dominion made the appropriate title of kings  odious; the title of a magistrate, who had the care of the public  granaries of corn, at length was applied to a wretched flatterer for a  dinner; and absurd philosophers occasioned a mere denomination to become  a by-name. To employ such terms in their primitive sense would now  confuse all ideas; yet there is an affectation of erudition which has  frequently revived terms sanctioned by antiquity. Bishop Watson entitled  his vindication of the Bible \"an _apology_:\" this word, in its primitive  sense, had long been lost for the multitude, whom he particularly  addressed in this work, and who could only understand it in the sense  they are accustomed to. Unquestionably, many of its readers have  imagined that the bishop was offering an _excuse_ for a belief in the  Bible, instead of a _vindication_ of its truth. The word _impertinent_,  by the ancient jurisconsults, or law-counsellors, who gave their opinion  on cases, was used merely in opposition to _pertinent_--_ratio  pertinens_ is a pertinent reason, that is, a reason _pertaining_ to the  cause in question, and a _ratio impertinens_, an impertinent reason, is  an argument _not pertaining_ to the subject.[44] _Impertinent_ then  originally meant neither absurdity nor rude intrusion, as it does in our  present popular sense. The learned Arnauld having characterised a reply  of one of his adversaries by the epithet _impertinent_, when blamed for  the freedom of his language, explained his meaning by giving this  history of the word, which applies to our own language. Thus also with  us the word _indifferent_ has entirely changed: an historian, whose work  was _indifferently_ written, would formerly have claimed our attention.  In the Liturgy it is prayed that \"magistrates may _indifferently_  minister justice.\" _Indifferently_ originally meant _impartially_. The  word _extravagant_, in its primitive signification, only signified to  digress from the subject. The Decretals, or those letters from the popes  deciding on points of ecclesiastical discipline, were at length  incorporated with the canon law, and were called _extravagant_ by  _wandering out_ of the body of the canon law, being confusedly dispersed  through that collection. When Luther had the Decretals publicly burnt at  Wittemberg, the insult was designed for the pope, rather than as a  condemnation of the canon law itself. Suppose, in the present case, two  persons of opposite opinions. The catholic, who had said that the  decretals were _extravagant_, might not have intended to depreciate  them, or make any concession to the Lutheran. What confusion of words  has the _common sense_ of the Scotch metaphysicians introduced into  philosophy! There are no words, perhaps, in the language which may be so  differently interpreted; and Professor Dugald Stewart has collected, in  a curious note in the second volume of his \"Philosophy of the Human  Mind,\" a singular variety of its opposite significations. The Latin  phrase, _sensus communis_, may, in various passages of Cicero, be  translated by our phrase _common sense_; but, on other occasions, it  means something different; the _sensus communis_ of the schoolmen is  quite another thing, and is synonymous with _conception_, and referred  to the seat of intellect; with Sir John Davies, in his curious  metaphysical poem, _common sense_ is used as _imagination_. It created a  controversy with Beattie and Reid; and Reid, who introduced this vague  ambiguous phrase in philosophical language, often understood the term in  its ordinary acceptation. This change of the meaning of words, which is  constantly recurring in metaphysical disputes, has made that curious but  obscure science liable to this objection of Hobbes, \"with many words  making nothing understood!\"    Controversies have been keenly agitated about the principles of morals,  which resolve entirely into _verbal disputes_, or at most into questions  of arrangement and classification, of little comparative moment to the  points at issue. This observation of Mr. Dugald Stewart's might be  illustrated by the fate of the numerous inventors of systems of thinking  or morals, who have only employed very different and even opposite terms  in appearance to express the same thing. Some, by their mode of  philosophising, have strangely unsettled the words _self-interest_ and  _self-love_; and their misconceptions have sadly misled the votaries of  these systems of morals; as others also by such vague terms as \"utility,  fitness,\" &c.    When Epicurus asserted that the sovereign good consisted in _pleasure_,  opposing the unfeeling austerity of the Stoics by the softness of  pleasurable emotions, his principle was soon disregarded; while his  _word_, perhaps chosen in the spirit of paradox, was warmly adopted by  the sensualist. Epicurus, of whom Seneca has drawn so beautiful a  domestic scene, in whose garden a loaf, a Cytheridean cheese, and a  draught which did not inflame thirst,[45] was the sole banquet, would  have started indignantly at      The fattest hog in Epicurus' sty!    Such are the facts which illustrate that principle in \"the abuse of  words,\" which Locke calls \"an affected obscurity arising from applying  _old words to new, or unusual significations_.\"    It was the same \"confusion of words\" which gave rise to the famous sect  of the Sadducees. The master of its founder Sadoc, in his moral purity,  was desirous of a disinterested worship of the Deity; he would not have  men like slaves, obedient from the hope of reward or the fear of  punishment. Sadoc drew a quite contrary inference from the intention of  his master, concluding that there were neither rewards nor punishments  in a future state. The result is a parallel to the fate of Epicurus. The  morality of the master of Sadoc was of the most pure and elevated kind,  but in the \"confusion of words,\" the libertines adopted them for their  own purposes--and having once assumed that neither rewards nor  punishments existed in the after-state, they proceeded to the erroneous  consequence that man perished with his own dust!    The plainest words, by accidental associations, may suggest the most  erroneous conceptions, and have been productive of the grossest errors.  In the famous Bangorian controversy, one of the writers excites a smile  by a complaint, arising from his views of the signification of a plain  word, whose meaning he thinks had been changed by the contending  parties. He says, \"the word _country_, like a great many others, such as  _church_ and kingdom, is, by the Bishop of Bangor's leave, become to  signify a _collection of ideas_ very different from its _original  meaning_; with some it implies _party_, with others _private opinion_,  and with most _interest_, and perhaps, in time, may signify _some other  country_. When this good innocent word has been tossed backwards and  forwards a little longer, some new reformer of language may arise to  reduce it to its primitive signification--_the real interest of Great  Britain!_\" The antagonist of this controversialist probably retorted on  him his own term of _the real interest_, which might be a very opposite  one, according to their notions! It has been said, with what truth I  know not, that it was by a mere confusion of words that Burke was  enabled to alarm the great Whig families, by showing them their fate in  that of the French _noblesse_; they were misled by the _similitude of  names_. The French _noblesse_ had as little resemblance to our nobility  as they have to the Mandarins of China. However it may be in this case,  certain it is that the same terms misapplied have often raised those  delusive notions termed false analogies. It was long imagined in this  country, that the _parliaments_ of France were somewhat akin to our own;  but these assemblies were very differently constituted, consisting only  of lawyers in courts of law. A misnomer confuses all argument. There is  a trick which consists in bestowing good names on bad things. Vices,  thus veiled, are introduced to us as virtues, according to an old poet,      As drunkenness, good-fellowship we call?         SIR THOMAS WIAT.    Or the reverse, when loyalty may be ridiculed, as      The right divine of kings--to govern wrong!    The most innocent recreations, such as the drama, dancing, dress, have  been anathematised by puritans, while philosophers have written  elaborate treatises in their defence--the enigma is solved, when we  discover that these words suggested a set of opposite notions to each.    But the nominalists and the realists, and the _doctores fundatissimi_,  _resolutissimi_, _refulgentes_, _profundi_, and _extatici_, have left  this heirloom of logomachy to a race as subtle and irrefragable! An  extraordinary scene has recently been performed by a new company of  actors, in the modern comedy of Political Economy; and the whole  dialogue has been carried on in an inimitable \"confusion of words!\" This  reasoning and unreasoning fraternity never use a term as a term, but for  an explanation, and which employed by them all, signifies opposite  things, but never the plainest! Is it not, therefore, strange that they  cannot yet tell us what"]]]
