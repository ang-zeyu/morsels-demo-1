They were advancing at a walk,  with the cheering people hanging to their stirrups, clutching at their  hands and hanging to the bridles of their horses.    General White's first greeting was characteristically unselfish and  loyal, and typical of the British officer.  He gave no sign of his own in  calculable relief, nor did he give to Caesar the things which were  Caesar's.  He did not cheer Dundonald, nor Buller, nor the column which  had rescued him and his garrison from present starvation and probable  imprisonment at Pretoria.  He raised his helmet and cried, \"We will give  three cheers for the Queen!\"  And then the general and the healthy,  ragged, and sunburned troopers from the outside world, the starved,  fever-ridden garrison, and the starved, fever-ridden civilians stood with  hats off and sang their national anthem.    The column outside had been fighting steadily for six weeks to get  Dundonald or any one of its force into Ladysmith; for fourteen days it  had been living in the open, fighting by night as well as by day, without  halt or respite; the garrison inside had been for four months holding the  enemy at bay with the point of the bayonet; it was famished for food, it  was rotten with fever, and yet when the relief came and all turned out  well, the first thought of every one was for the Queen!    It may be credulous in them or old-fashioned; but it is certainly very  unselfish, and when you take their point of view it is certainly very  fine.    After the Queen every one else had his share of the cheering, and General  White could not complain of the heartiness with which they greeted him,  he tried to make a speech in reply, but it was a brief one.  He spoke of  how much they owed to General Buller and his column, and he congratulated  his own soldiers on the defence they had made.    \"I am very sorry, men,\" he said, \"that I had to cut down your rations.  I--I promise you I won't do it again.\"    Then he stopped very suddenly and whirled his horse's head around and  rode away.  Judging from the number of times they told me of this, the  fact that they had all but seen an English general give way to his  feelings seemed to have impressed the civilian mind of Ladysmith more  than the entrance of the relief force.  The men having come in and  demonstrated that the way was open, rode forth again, and the relief of  Ladysmith had taken place.  But it is not the people cheering in the dark  streets, nor General White breaking down in his speech of welcome, which  gives the note to the way the men of Ladysmith received their freedom.  It is rather the fact that as the two hundred battle-stained and  earth-stained troopers galloped forward, racing to be the first, and  rising in their stirrups to cheer, the men in the hospital camps said,  \"Well, they're come at last, have they?\" and continued fussing over their  fourth of a ration of tea.  That gives the real picture of how Ladysmith  came into her inheritance, and of how she received her rescuers.    On the morning after Dundonald had ridden in and out of Ladysmith, two  other correspondents and myself started to relieve it on our own account.  We did not know the way to Ladysmith, and we did not then know whether or  not the Boers still occupied Bulwana Mountain.  But we argued that the  chances of the Boers having raised the siege were so good that it was  worth risking their not having done so, and being taken prisoner.    We carried all the tobacco we could pack in our saddle-bags, and enough  food for one day.  My chief regret was that my government, with true  republican simplicity, had given me a passport, type-written on a modest  sheet of notepaper and wofully lacking in impressive seals and coats of  arms.  I fancied it would look to Boer eyes like one I might have forged  for myself in the writing-room of the hotel at Cape Town.    We had ridden up Pieter's Hill and scrambled down on its other side  before we learned that the night before Dundonald had raised the siege.  We learned this from long trains of artillery and regiments of infantry  which already were moving forward over the great plain which lies between  Pieter's and Bulwana.  We learned it also from the silence of  conscientious, dutiful correspondents, who came galloping back as we  galloped forward, and who made wide detours at sight of us, or who, when  we hailed them, lashed their ponies over the red rocks and pretended not  to hear, each unselfishly turning his back on Ladysmith in the hope that  he might be the first to send word that the \"Doomed City\" was relieved.  This would enable one paper to say that it had the news \"on the street\"  five minutes earlier than its hated rivals.  We found that the rivalry of  our respective papers bored us.  We condemned it as being childish and  weak.  London, New York, Chicago were names, they were spots thousands of  leagues away: Ladysmith was just across that mountain.  If our horses  held out at the pace, we would be--after Dundonald--the first men in.  We  imagined that we would see hysterical women and starving men.  They would  wring our hands, and say, \"God bless you,\" and we would halt our steaming  horses in the market-place, and distribute the news of the outside world,  and tobacco.  There would be shattered houses, roofless homes, deep pits  in the roadways where the shells had burst and buried themselves.  We  would see the entombed miner at the moment of his deliverance, we would  be among the first from the outer world to break the spell of his  silence; the first to receive the brunt of the imprisoned people's  gratitude and rejoicings.    Indeed, it was clearly our duty to the papers that employed us that we  should not send them news, but that we should be the first to enter  Ladysmith.  We were surely the best judges of what was best to do.  How  like them to try to dictate to us from London and New York, when we were  on the spot!  It was absurd.  We shouted this to each other as we raced  in and out of the long confused column, lashing viciously with our whips.  We stumbled around pieces of artillery, slid in between dripping  water-carts, dodged the horns of weary oxen, scattered companies of  straggling Tommies, and ducked under protruding tent-poles on the  baggage-wagons, and at last came out together again in advance of the  dusty column.    \"Besides, we don't know where the press-censor is, do we?\"  No, of course  we had no idea where the press-censor was, and unless he said that  Ladysmith was relieved, the fact that twenty-five thousand other soldiers  said so counted for idle gossip.  Our papers could not expect us to go  riding over mountains the day Ladysmith was relieved, hunting for a  press-censor.  \"That press-censor,\" gasped Hartland, \"never--is--where  he--ought to be.\"  The words were bumped out of him as he was shot up and  down in the saddle.  That was it.  It was the press-censor's fault.  Our  consciences were clear now.  If our papers worried themselves or us  because they did not receive the great news until every one else knew of  it, it was all because of that press-censor.  We smiled again and spurred  the horses forward.  We abused the press-censor roundly--we were  extremely indignant with him.  It was so like him to lose himself the day  Ladysmith was relieved.  \"Confound him,\" we muttered, and grinned  guiltily.  We felt as we used to feel when we were playing truant from  school.    We were nearing Pieter's Station now, and were half-way to Ladysmith.  But the van of the army was still about us.  Was it possible that it  stretched already into the beleaguered city?  Were we, after all, to be  cheated of the first and freshest impressions?  The tall lancers turned  at the sound of the horses' hoofs and stared, infantry officers on foot  smiled up at us sadly, they were dirty and dusty and sweating, they  carried rifles and cross belts like the Tommies; and they knew that we  outsiders who were not under orders would see the chosen city before  them.  Some of them shouted to us, but we only nodded and galloped on.  We wanted to get rid of them all, but they were interminable.  When we  thought we had shaken them off, and that we were at last in advance, we  would come upon a group of them resting on the same ground their shells  had torn up during the battle the day before.    We passed Boer laagers marked by empty cans and broken saddles and black,  cold camp-fires.  At Pieter's Station the blood was still fresh on the  grass where two hours before some of the South African Light Horse had  been wounded.    The Boers were still on Bulwana then?  Perhaps, after all, we had better  turn back and try to find that press-censor.  But we rode on and saw  Pieter's Station, as we passed it, as an absurd relic of by-gone days  when bridges were intact and trains ran on schedule time.  One door seen  over the shoulder as we galloped past read, \"Station Master's  Office--Private,\" and in contempt of that stern injunction, which would  make even the first-class passenger hesitate, one of our shells had  knocked away the half of the door and made its privacy a mockery.  We had  only to follow the track now and we would arrive in time--unless the  Boers were still on Bulwana.  We had shaken off the army, and we were two  miles in front of it, when six men came galloping toward us in an  unfamiliar uniform.  They passed us far to the right, regardless of the  trail, and galloping through the high grass.  We pulled up when we saw  them, for they had green facings to their gray uniforms, and no one with  Buller's column wore green facings.    We gave a yell in chorus.  \"Are you from Ladysmith?\" we shouted.  The  men, before they answered, wheeled and cheered, and came toward us  laughing jubilant.  \"We're the first men out,\" cried the officer and we  rode in among them, shaking "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30541"],[0,"A Treatise on Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene (Revised Edition) (#20)"],[1,"the jejunum. There is no mark to distinguish the termination of  the one or the commencement of the other. The ileum terminates near  the right haunch-bone, by a valvular opening into the colon at an  obtuse angle. This arrangement prevents the passing of substances from  the colon into the ileum. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded above  and at the sides by the colon.    248. The small intestine, like the stomach, has three coats. The  inner, or mucous coat is thrown into folds, or valves. In consequence  of this valvular arrangement, the mucous membrane is more extensive  than the other tissues, and gives a greater extent of surface with  which the aliment comes in contact. There are imbedded under this  membrane an immense number of minute glands, and it has a great number  of piles, like those upon velvet. For this reason, this membrane is  sometimes called the _vil'lous_ coat.    249. The CAECUM is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, at the commencement  of the large intestine. Attached to its extremity is the _ap-pend'ix  verm-i-form'is_, (a long, worm-shaped tube.) It is from one to six  inches in length, and of the size of a goose-quill.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What important ducts open into it? 246. Describe the jejunum. 247. The  ileum. 248. What is said of the coats of the intestines? Why is the  mucous membrane sometimes called the villous coat? 249. Describe the  caecum.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    250. The COLON is divided into three parts--the _ascending_,  _transverse_, and _descending_. The ascending colon passes upward from  the right haunch-bone to the under surface of the liver. It then bends  inward, and crosses the upper part of the abdomen, below the liver and  stomach, to the left side under the name of the transverse colon. At  the left side, it turns, and descends to the left haunch-bone, and is  called the descending colon. Here it makes a peculiar curve upon  itself, which is called the _sig'moid flex'ure_.    [Illustration: Fig. 61. 1, 1, The duodenum. 2, 2, The small intestine. 3,  The junction of the small intestine with the colon. 4, The appendix  vermiformis. 5, The caecum. 6, The ascending colon. 7, The transverse  colon. 8, The descending colon. 9, The sigmoid flexure of the colon. 10,  The rectum.]      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    250. Describe the course of the divisions of the colon. Explain fig.  61.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    251. The RECTUM is the termination of the large intestine. The large  intestine has three coats, like the stomach and small intestine. The  longitudinal fibres of the muscular coat are collected into three  bands. These bands are nearly one half shorter than the intestine, and  give it a sacculated appearance, which is characteristic of the caecum  and colon.    252. The LACTEALS are minute vessels, which commence in the villi,  upon the mucous surface of the small intestine. From the intestine  they pass between the membranes of the _mes'en-ter-y_ to small glands,  which they enter. The first range of glands collects many small  vessels, and transmits a few larger branches to a second range of  glands; and, finally, after passing through several successive ranges  of these glandular bodies, the lacteals, diminished in number and  increased in size, proceed to the enlarged portion of the thoracic  duct, into which they open. They are most numerous in the upper  portion of the small intestine.    253. The THORACIC DUCT commences in the abdomen, by a considerable  dilatation, which is situated in front of the lower portion of the  spinal column. From this point, it passes through the diaphragm, and  ascends to the lower part of the neck. In its ascent, it lies anterior  to the spine, and by the side of the aorta and oesophagus. At the  lower part of the neck, it makes a sudden turn downward and forward,  and terminates by opening into a large vein which passes to the heart.  The thoracic duct is equal in diameter to a goose-quill, and, at its  termination, is provided with a pair of semilunar valves, which  prevent the admission of venous blood into its cylinder.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    251. What is said of the arrangement of the fibres of the muscular  coat of the large intestine? 252. What are the lacteals? Give their  course from the mucous coat of the intestine to the thoracic duct.  253. Describe the course of the thoracic duct.

What is said respecting the mesenteric glands?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Observation._ The mesenteric glands, which are situated between two  layers of serous membrane (mesentery) that connects the small  intestine with the spinal column, occasionally become diseased in  childhood, and prevent the chyle from passing to the thoracic duct.  Children thus affected have a voracious appetite, and at the same time  are becoming more and more emaciated. The disease is called mesenteric  consumption.    254. The LIVER, a gland appended to the alimentary canal, is the  largest organ in the system, and weighs about four pounds. It is  situated in the right side, below the diaphragm, and is composed of  several lobes. Its upper surface is convex; its under, concave. This  organ is retained in its place by several ligaments. It performs the  double office of separating impurities from the venous blood, and of  secreting a fluid (bile) necessary to chylification. On the under  surface of the liver is a membranous sac, called the _gall-cyst_,  which is generally considered as a reservoir for the bile.    [Illustration: Fig. 63. The under surface of the liver. 1, The right  lobe. 2, The left. 3, 4, Smaller lobes. 10, The gall-bladder, or cyst,  lodged in its depression. 17, The notch on the posterior border, for the  spinal column.]    _Observation._ A good idea of the liver and intestines can be obtained  by examining these parts of a pig. In this animal, the sacs, or  pouches, of the large intestine are well defined.    255. The PANCREAS is a long, flattened gland, analogous to the  salivary glands. It is about six inches in length, weighs three or  four ounces, and is situated transversely across the posterior wall of  the abdomen, behind the stomach. A duct from this organ opens into the  duodenum.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    254. Describe the liver. 255. What is said of the pancreas?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    256. The SPLEEN, (milt,) so called because the ancients supposed it to  be the seat of melancholy, is an oblong, flattened organ, situated in  the left side, in contact with the diaphragm, stomach, and the  pancreas. It is of a dark, bluish color, and is abundantly supplied  with blood, but has no duct which serves as an outlet for any  secretion. Its use is not well determined.    [Illustration: Fig. 64. The pancreas with its duct, through which the  pancreatic secretion passes into the duodenum.]    257. The OMENTUM (caul) consists of four layers of the serous  membrane, which descends from the stomach and transverse colon. A  quantity of adipose matter is deposited around its vessels, which  ramify through its structure. Its function is twofold in the animal  economy. 1st. It protects the intestines from cold. 2d. It facilitates  the movements of the intestines upon each other during their  vermicular, or worm-like action.    258. Every part of the digestive apparatus is supplied with arteries,  veins, lymphatics, and nervous filaments, from the ganglionic system  of nerves.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    256.

With what is  every part of the digestive apparatus supplied?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER XIV.    PHYSIOLOGY OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.      259. Substances received into the stomach as food, must necessarily  undergo many changes before they are fitted to form part of the animal  body. The solid portions are reduced to a fluid state, and those parts  that will nourish the body are separated from the waste material.    260. The first preparation of food for admission into the system,  consists in its proper mastication. The lips in front, the cheeks upon  the side, the soft palate, by closing down upon the base of the  tongue, retain the food in the mouth, while it is subjected to the;  process of _mas-ti-ca'tion_, (chewing.) The tongue rolls the mass  around, and keeps it between the teeth, while they divide the food to  a fineness suitable for the stomach.    261. While the food is in process of mastication, there is incorporated  with it a considerable amount of _sa-li'va_, (spittle.) This fluid is  furnished by the salivary glands, situated in the vicinity of the  mouth. The saliva moistens and softens the food, so that, when carried  into the pharynx. it is passed, with ease, through the oesophagus into the  stomach.    262. When the food has been properly masticated, (and in rapid eaters  when it is not,) the soft palate is raised from the base of the tongue  backward, so as to close the posterior opening through the nostrils.  By a movement of the muscles of the tongue, cheeks, and floor of the  mouth, simultaneous with that of the soft palate, the food is pressed  into the upper part of the pharynx.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    259-272. _Give the physiology of the digestive organs._ 259."]]]
