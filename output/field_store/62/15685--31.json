Azote    1       5        25.82        = 961.82.    By this we find that, during the above deflagration, 2 gros 1-1/3  gr. of charcoal have suffered combustion, alongst with 3738.34 grs.  or 6 oz. 3 gros 66.34 grs. of oxygen. Hence, since 12 libs. of  ice were melted during the combustion, it follows, that one pound of  oxygen burnt in the same manner would have melted 29.58320 libs. of  ice. To which the quantity of caloric, retained by a pound of oxygen  after combining with charcoal to form carbonic acid gas, being added,  which was already ascertained to be capable of melting 29.13844 libs.  of ice, we have for the total quantity of caloric remaining in a pound  of oxygen, when combined with nitrous gas in the nitric acid 58.72164;  which is the number of pounds of ice the caloric remaining in the oxygen  in that state is capable of melting.    We have before seen that, in the state of oxygen gas, it contained at  least 66.66667; wherefore it follows that, in combining with azote to  form nitric acid, it only loses 7.94502. Farther experiments upon this  subject are necessary to ascertain how far the results of this  calculation may agree with direct fact. This enormous quantity of  caloric retained by oxygen in its combination into nitric acid, explains  the cause of the great disengagement of caloric during the  deflagrations of nitre; or, more strictly speaking, upon all occasions  of the decomposition of nitric acid.      _Of the Combustion of Wax._    Having examined several cases of simple combustion, I mean now to give a  few examples of a more complex nature. One pound of wax-taper being  allowed to burn slowly in an ice apparatus, melted 133 libs. 2 oz.  5-1/3 gros of ice. According to my experiments in the Memoirs of the  Academy for 1784, p. 606, one pound of wax-taper consists of 13 oz. 1  gros 23 grs. of charcoal, and 2 oz. 6 gros 49 grs. of  hydrogen.    By the foregoing experiments, the above  quantity of charcoal ought to melt             79.39390 libs. of ice;  and the hydrogen should melt                   52.37605                                                ---------                    In all                      131.76995 libs.    Thus, we see the quantity of caloric disengaged from a burning taper, is  pretty exactly conformable to what was obtained by burning separately a  quantity of charcoal and hydrogen equal to what enters into its  composition. These experiments with the taper were several times  repeated, so that I have reason to believe them accurate.      _Combustion of Olive Oil._    We included a burning lamp, containing a determinate quantity of  olive-oil, in the ordinary apparatus, and, when the experiment was  finished, we ascertained exactly the quantities of oil consumed, and of  ice melted; the result was, that, during the combustion of one pound of  olive-oil, 148 libs. 14 oz. 1 gros of ice were melted. By my  experiments in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, and of which the  following Chapter contains an abstract, it appears that one pound of  olive-oil consists of 12 oz. 5 gros 5 grs. of charcoal, and 3  oz. 2 gros 67 grs. of hydrogen. By the foregoing experiments, that  quantity of charcoal should melt 76.18723 libs. of ice, and the  quantity of hydrogen in a pound of the oil should melt 62.15053 libs.  The sum of these two gives 138.33776 libs. of ice, which the two  constituent elements of the oil would have melted, had they separately  suffered combustion, whereas the oil really melted 148.88330 libs.  which gives an excess of 10.54554 in the result of the experiment above  the calculated result, from data furnished by former experiments.    This difference, which is by no means very considerable, may arise from  errors which are unavoidable in experiments of this nature, or it may be  owing to the composition of oil not being as yet exactly ascertained. It  proves, however, that there is a great agreement between the results of  our experiments, respecting the combination of caloric, and those which  regard its disengagement.    The following desiderata still remain to be determined, viz. What  quantity of caloric is retained by oxygen, after combining with metals,  so as to convert them into oxyds; What quantity is contained by  hydrogen, in its different states of existence; and to ascertain, with  more precision than is hitherto attained, how much caloric is disengaged  during the formation of water, as there still remain considerable doubts  with respect to our present determination of this point, which can only  be removed by farther experiments. We are at present occupied with this  inquiry; and, when once these several points are well ascertained, which  we hope they will soon be, we shall probably be under the necessity of  making considerable corrections upon most of the results of the  experiments and calculations in this Chapter. I did not, however,  consider this as a sufficient reason for withholding so much as is  already known from such as may be inclined to labour upon the same  subject. It is difficult, in our endeavours to discover the principles  of a new science, to avoid beginning by guess-work; and it is rarely  possible to arrive at perfection from the first setting out.          CHAP. X.    _Of the Combination of Combustible Substances with each other._      As combustible substances in general have a great affinity for oxygen,  they ought likewise to attract, or tend to combine with each other;  _quae sunt eadem uni tertio, sunt eadem inter se_; and the axiom is  found to be true. Almost all the metals, for instance, are capable of  uniting with each other, and forming what are called _alloys_[22], in  common language. Most of these, like all combinations, are susceptible  of several degrees of saturation; the greater number of these alloys are  more brittle than the pure metals of which they are composed, especially  when the metals alloyed together are considerably different in their  degrees of fusibility. To this difference in fusibility, part of the  phenomena attendant upon _alloyage_ are owing, particularly the property  of iron, called by workmen _hotshort_. This kind of iron must be  considered as an alloy, or mixture of pure iron, which is almost  infusible, with a small portion of some other metal which fuses in a  much lower degree of heat. So long as this alloy remains cold, and both  metals are in the solid state, the mixture is malleable; but, if heated  to a sufficient degree to liquify the more fusible metal, the particles  of the liquid metal, which are interposed between the particles of the  metal remaining solid, must destroy their continuity, and occasion the  alloy to become brittle. The alloys of mercury, with the other metals,  have usually been called _amalgams_, and we see no inconvenience from  continuing the use of that term.    Sulphur, phosphorus, and charcoal, readily unite with metals.  Combinations of sulphur with metals are usually named _pyrites_. Their  combinations with phosphorus and charcoal are either not yet named, or  have received new names only of late; so that we have not scrupled to  change them according to our principles. The combinations of metal and  sulphur we call _sulphurets_, those with phosphorus _phosphurets_, and  those formed with charcoal _carburets_. These denominations are extended  to all the combinations into which the above three substances enter,  without being previously oxygenated. Thus, the combination of sulphur  with potash, or fixed vegetable alkali, is called _sulphuret of potash_;  that which it forms with ammoniac, or volatile alkali, is termed  _sulphuret of ammoniac_.    Hydrogen is likewise capable of combining with many combustible  substances. In the state of gas, it dissolves charcoal, sulphur,  phosphorus, and several metals; we distinguish these combinations by the  terms, _carbonated hydrogen gas_, _sulphurated hydrogen gas_, and  _phosphorated hydrogen gas_. The sulphurated hydrogen gas was called  _hepatic air_ by former chemists, or _foetid air from sulphur_, by Mr  Scheele. The virtues of several mineral waters, and the foetid smell of  animal excrements, chiefly arise from the presence of this gas. The  phosphorated hydrogen gas is remarkable for the property, discovered by  Mr Gengembre, of taking fire spontaneously upon getting into contact  with atmospheric air, or, what is better, with oxygen gas. This gas has  a strong flavour, resembling that of putrid fish; and it is very  probable that the phosphorescent quality of fish, in the state of  putrefaction, arises from the escape of this species of gas. When  hydrogen and charcoal are combined together, without the intervention of  caloric, to bring the hydrogen into the state of gas, they form oil,  which is either fixed or volatile, according to the proportions of  hydrogen and charcoal in its composition. The chief difference between  fixed or fat oils drawn from vegetables by expression, and volatile or  essential oils, is, that the former contains an excess of charcoal,  which is separated when the oils are heated above the degree of boiling  water; whereas the volatile oils, containing a just proportion of these  two constituent ingredients, are not liable to be decomposed by that  heat, but, uniting with caloric into the gasseous state, pass over in  distillation unchanged.    In the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, p. 593. I gave an account of my  experiments upon the composition of oil and alkohol, by the union of  hydrogen with charcoal, and of their combination with oxygen. By these  experiments, it appears that fixed oils combine with oxygen during  combustion, and are thereby converted into water and carbonic acid. By  means of calculation applied to the products of these experiments, we  find that fixed oil is composed of 21 parts, by weight, of hydrogen  combined with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#20)"],[1," days  and nights, till, torn and bleeding, he had lain him down to die.    Then, when he was nigh unto death, lo! through the savage gloom there  came to him a stately maiden, and took him by the hand and led him on  through devious paths, unknown to any man, until upon the darkness of the  wood there dawned a light such as the light of day was unto but as a  little lamp unto the sun; and, in that wondrous light, our way-worn  knight saw as in a dream a vision, and so glorious, so fair the vision  seemed, that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more, but stood as one  entranced, whose joy is deep as is the sea, whereof no man can tell the  depth.    And the vision faded, and the knight, kneeling upon the ground, thanked  the good saint who into that sad wood had strayed his steps, so he had  seen the vision that lay there hid.    And the name of the dark forest was Sorrow; but of the vision that the  good knight saw therein we may not speak nor tell.          CHAPTER XI.      How George, once upon a time, got up early in the morning.--George,  Harris, and Montmorency do not like the look of the cold water.--Heroism  and determination on the part of J.--George and his shirt: story with a  moral.--Harris as cook.--Historical retrospect, specially inserted for  the use of schools.    I woke at six the next morning; and found George awake too.  We both  turned round, and tried to go to sleep again, but we could not.  Had  there been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep  again, but have got up and dressed then and there, we should have dropped  off while we were looking at our watches, and have slept till ten.  As  there was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours  at the very least, and our getting up at that time was an utter  absurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things  in general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more  would be death to us.    George said that the same kind of thing, only worse, had happened to him  some eighteen months ago, when he was lodging by himself in the house of  a certain Mrs. Gippings.  He said his watch went wrong one evening, and  stopped at a quarter-past eight.  He did not know this at the time  because, for some reason or other, he forgot to wind it up when he went  to bed (an unusual occurrence with him), and hung it up over his pillow  without ever looking at the thing.    It was in the winter when this happened, very near the shortest day, and  a week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that it was still very dark  when George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time.  He  reached up, and hauled down his watch.  It was a quarter-past eight.    \"Angels and ministers of grace defend us!\" exclaimed George; \"and here  have I got to be in the City by nine.  Why didn't somebody call me?  Oh,  this is a shame!\"  And he flung the watch down, and sprang out of bed,  and had a cold bath, and washed himself, and dressed himself, and shaved  himself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot, and  then rushed and had another look at the watch.    Whether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had  started it, or how it was, George could not say, but certain it was that  from a quarter-past eight it had begun to go, and now pointed to twenty  minutes to nine.    George snatched it up, and rushed downstairs.  In the sitting-room, all  was dark and silent: there was no fire, no breakfast.  George said it was  a wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what he  thought of her when he came home in the evening.  Then he dashed on his  great-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made for the front door.  The door was not even unbolted.  George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy  old woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up  at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door, and ran  out.    He ran hard for a quarter of a mile, and at the end of that distance it  began to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that there  were so few people about, and that there were no shops open.  It was  certainly a very dark and foggy morning, but still it seemed an unusual  course to stop all business on that account.  _He_ had to go to business:  why should other people stop in bed merely because it was dark and foggy!    At length he reached Holborn.  Not a shutter was down! not a bus was  about!  There were three men in sight, one of whom was a policeman; a  market-cart full of cabbages, and a dilapidated looking cab.  George  pulled out his watch and looked at it: it was five minutes to nine!  He  stood still and counted his pulse.  He stooped down and felt his legs.  Then, with his watch still in his hand, he went up to the policeman, and  asked him if he knew what the time was.    [Picture: George and the policeman] \"What's the time?\" said the man,  eyeing George up and down with evident suspicion; \"why, if you listen you  will hear it strike.\"    George listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged.    \"But it's only gone three!\" said George in an injured tone, when it had  finished.    \"Well, and how many did you want it to go?\" replied the constable.    \"Why, nine,\" said George, showing his watch.    \"Do you know where you live?\" said the guardian of public order,  severely.    George thought, and gave the address.    \"Oh! that's where it is, is it?\" replied the man; \"well, you take my  advice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours with you; and  don't let's have any more of it.\"    And George went home again, musing as he walked along, and let himself  in.    At first, when he got in, he determined to undress and go to bed again;  but when he thought of the redressing and re-washing, and the having of  another bath, he determined he would not, but would sit up and go to  sleep in the easy-chair.    But he could not get to sleep: he never felt more wakeful in his life; so  he lit the lamp and got out the chess-board, and played himself a game of  chess.  But even that did not enliven him: it seemed slow somehow; so he  gave chess up and tried to read.  He did not seem able to take any sort  of interest in reading either, so he put on his coat again and went out  for a walk.    It was horribly lonesome and dismal, and all the policemen he met  regarded him with undisguised suspicion, and turned their lanterns on him  and followed him about, and this had such an effect upon him at last that  he began to feel as if he really had done something, and he got to  slinking down the by-streets and hiding in dark doorways when he heard  the regulation flip-flop approaching.    Of course, this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him than  ever, and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was doing  there; and when he answered, \"Nothing,\" he had merely come out for a  stroll (it was then four o'clock in the morning), they looked as though  they did not believe him, and two plain-clothes constables came home with  him to see if he really did live where he had said he did.  They saw him  go in with his key, and then they took up a position opposite and watched  the house.    He thought he would light the fire when he got inside, and make himself  some breakfast, just to pass away the time; but he did not seem able to  handle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without dropping  it or falling over it, and making such a noise that he was in mortal fear  that it would wake Mrs. G. up, and that she would think it was burglars  and open the window and call \"Police!\" and then these two detectives  would rush in and handcuff him, and march him off to the police-court.    He was in a morbidly nervous state by this time, and he pictured the  trial, and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury, and  nobody believing him, and his being sentenced to twenty years' penal  servitude, and his mother dying of a broken heart.  So he gave up trying  to get breakfast, and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the  easy-chair till Mrs. G came down at half-past seven.    He said he had never got up too early since that morning: it had been  such a warning to him.    We had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while George had been telling  me this true story, and on his finishing it I set to work to wake up  Harris with a scull.  The third prod did it: and he turned over on the  other side, and said he would be down in a minute, and that he would have  his lace-up boots.  We soon let him know where he was, however, by the  aid of the hitcher, and he sat up suddenly, sending Montmorency, who had  been sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of his chest,  sprawling across the boat.    Then we pulled up the canvas, and all four of us poked our heads out over  the off-side, and looked down at the water and shivered.  The idea,  overnight, had been that we should get up early in the morning, fling off  our rugs and shawls, and, throwing back the canvas, spring into the river  with a joyous shout, and revel in a long delicious swim.  Somehow, now  the morning had come, the notion seemed less tempting.  The water looked  damp and chilly: the wind felt cold.    \"Well, who's going to be first in?\" said Harris at last.    There was no rush for precedence.  George settled the matter so far as he  was concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks.  Montmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl, as if merely thinking of  the thing had given him the horrors; and Harris said it would be so  difficult to get into the boat again, and went back and sorted out his  trousers.    I did not altogether like to give in, though I did not relish the plunge.  There might be snags about, or weeds, I thought.  I meant to compromise  matters by going down to the edge and just throwing the water over  myself; so I took a towel and crept "]]]
