It must be a recipe or      a chapter the existence of which was known to Torinus,      for he says: \"This entire chapter is wanting in our      copy.\"        III      [59] A DISH OF SOW'S MATRIX     _VULVULAE BOTELLI_ [1]    ENTREES [2] OF SOW'S MATRIX [3] ARE MADE THUS: CRUSH PEPPER AND CUMIN  WITH TWO SMALL HEADS OF LEEK, PEELED, ADD TO THIS PULP RUE, BROTH [and  the sow's matrix or fresh pork] CHOP, [or crush in mortar very fine]  THEN ADD TO THIS [forcemeat] INCORPORATING WELL PEPPER GRAINS AND  [pine] NUTS [4] FILL THE CASING [5] AND BOIL IN WATER [with] OIL AND  BROTH [for seasoning] AND A BUNCH OF LEEKS AND DILL.

[2] V. \"_Entrees_\" out of respect for the ancients who      used them as such; today we would class such dishes      among the \"_hors d'{oe}uvres chauds_.\"        [3] V. _Vulvula_, dim. for _vulva_, sow's matrix. Cf.      _vulva_ in dictionary. Possible, also possible that      _volva_ is meant--a meat roll, a croquette.        [4] V. Combinations of chopped nuts and pork still in      vogue today; we use the green pistachios.        [5] V. The casings which were filled with this forcemeat      may have been the sow's matrices, also caul. The      original is vague on the point.      [60] LITTLE SAUSAGE     _BOTELLUM_ [1]    BOTELLUM IS MADE OF [2] HARD BOILED YOLKS OF EGG [3] CHOPPED PIGNOLIA  NUTS, ONION AND LEEKS, RAW GROUND PINE [4] FINE PEPPER, STUFF IN  CASINGS AND COOK IN BROTH AND WINE [5].        [1] V. _Botelli_, or _botuli_, are sausage of various      kind; (French, Boudin, English, Pudding). Originally      made of raw blood, they are in fact, miniature blood      sausage. The absence of meat in the present formula      makes me believe that it is not complete, though hard      boiled yolk when properly seasoned and mixed with the      right amount of fat, make a tasty forcemeat for sausage.

[4] Goll. _Thus crudum_--raw blood. _Thus_ or _tus_ is      either frankincense or the herb, ground-pine. Dann.      Rosemary. Hum. _Thus crudum lege jus crudum_--jus or      broth which would make the forcemeat soft. There is no      reason for changing \"_thus_\" into \"_jus_!\"        [5] G.-V. _Adicies liquamen et vinum, et sic coques_.      Tor. & _vino decoquas_.

TO THIS MIXTURE, BEING RICH, ADD WHOLE PEPPER AND NUTS. WHEN  FILLING CASINGS CAREFULLY PUSH THE MEAT THROUGH. HANG SAUSAGE UP TO  SMOKE.        V. Lister's interesting remarks about the makers of      these sausages are given in the dictionary. Cf. Longano.        V      [62] SAUSAGE     _FARCIMINA_    POUND EGGS AND BRAINS [eggs raw, brains cooked] PINE NUTS [chopped  fine] PEPPER [whole] BROTH AND A LITTLE LASER WITH WHICH FILL THE  CASINGS. FIRST PARBOIL THE SAUSAGE THEN FRY THEM AND SERVE.        V. The directions are vague enough, but one may      recognize in them our modern brain sausage.      [63] ANOTHER SAUSAGE     _ALITER_    WORK COOKED SPELT AND FINELY CHOPPED FRESH PORK TOGETHER, POUND IT  WITH PEPPER, BROTH AND PIGNOLIA NUTS. FILL THE CASINGS, PARBOIL AND  FRY WITH SALT, SERVE WITH MUSTARD, OR YOU MAY CUT THE SAUSAGE IN  SLICES AND SERVE ON A ROUND DISH.

Unquestionably he: for there was no mistaking  his giant figure. He was down on the camp-ledge, running toward the  foot of the staircase, coming up to help this other man in advance of  him.    I thought of my revolver. I turned to try and find it. I was aware  that the first of my assailants was at the stairhead. I could not  locate at once where the revolver had fallen. I would be caught,  leaped upon from behind. Should I run?    I swung back to see what the oncoming brigand was doing. He had  reached the summit. His arms went up, legs bent under him. With a  sailing leap he launched for me. I could have bounded way, but with a  last look to locate the revolver, I braced myself for the shock.    The figure hit me. It was small and light in my clutching arms. I  recall I saw that Miko was half-way up the staircase. I gripped my  assailant. The audiphone contact brought a voice.    \"Gregg! Is it you?\"    It was Anita clutching at me!      CHAPTER XXVI    _At Bay_    \"Gregg, you're safe!\"    She had heard the camp corridors resounding with the shouts that Wilks  and Haljan were fighting. She had come upon a suit and helmet by the  manual emergency lock, had run out through the lock, confused, with  her only idea to stop Wilks and me from fighting. Then she had seen  one of us killed. Impulsive, barely knowing what she was doing, she  mounted the stairs, frantic to find if I were alive.    \"Anita!\"    Miko was coming! She had not seen him: for she had no thought of  brigands--only the belief that either Wilks or I had been killed.    But now, as for an instant we stood together on the rocks near the  observation platform, I could see the towering figure of Miko nearing  the top of the stairs.    \"Anita, that's Miko! We must run.\"    Then I saw my bullet projector. It lay in a bowl-like depression quite  near us. I jumped for it. And as I tore loose from Anita, she leaped  down after me. It was a broken bowl in the rocks, some six feet deep.  It was open on the side facing the staircase--a narrow, ravinelike  gully, full of gray, broken, tumbled rock-masses. The little gully was  littered with crags and boulders. But I could see out through it.    Miko had come to the head of the staircase. He stopped there, his  great figure etched sharply by the Earthlight. I think he must have  known that Coniston was the one who had fallen over the cliff, as my  helmet and Coniston's were different enough for him to recognize which  was which. He did not know who I was, but he did know me for an enemy.           *       *       *       *       *    He stood now at the summit, peering to see where we had gone. He was  no more than fifty feet from us.    \"Anita, lie down.\"    I pulled her down on the rocks. I took aim with the bullet projector.  But I had forgotten our helmet-lights. Miko must have seen them just  as I pulled the trigger. The flying bullet missed him as he jumped  sidewise. He dropped, but I could see him moving in the shadows to  where a jutting rock gave him shelter. I fired again.    \"Gregg.\"    I had stood up to take aim. I saw the bullet chip a bit of rock. Anita  pulled me sharply down beside her.    \"Gregg, he's armed!\"    It was his turn to fire. It came--the familiar vague flash of the  paralyzing ray. It spat its tint of color on the rocks near us, but  could not reach us.    Miko rose a moment later and bounded to another rock. I scrambled up,  and shot at him, but missed. Then he crouched and returned my fire  from his new angle; but Anita and I had shifted.    Time passed--only a few moments. I could not see Miko momentarily.  Perhaps he was crouching; perhaps he had moved away again. He was, or  had been, on slightly higher ground than the bottom of our bowl. It  was dim down here where we were lying, but I feared that every moment  Miko might appear and strike at us. His ray at any short range would  penetrate our visor-panes, even though our suits might temporarily  resist it.    \"Anita--it's too dangerous here.\"    Had I been alone, I might perhaps have leaped up to lure Miko. But  with Anita I did not dare chance it.    \"We've got to get back to the camp,\" I told her. The audiphone brought  her comment:    \"Perhaps he has gone.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But he had not. We saw him again, out in a distant patch of  Earthlight. He was further from us than before, but on still higher  ground. We had extinguished our small helmet-lights. But he knew we  were here, and possibly he could see us. His projector flashed again.  But we had again shifted, and were untouched. He was a hundred feet or  more away now. His weapon was of longer range than mine. I did not  answer his fire, for I could not hope to hit him at such a distance,  and the flash of my weapon would help him with his aim.    I murmured to Anita, \"We must get out of here.\"    Yet how did I dare take Anita from these concealing shadows? Miko  could reach us so easily as we bounded away, in plain view in the  Earthlight of the open summit! We were caught, at bay in this little  bowl.    The camp from here was not visible. But out through the broken gully,  beyond the staircase top, a white beam of light suddenly came up from  below.    \"_Haljan._\"    It spelled the signal.    \"_Haljan._\"    It was coming from the Grantline instrument room, I knew.    I could answer it with my helmet-light, but I did not dare. I  hesitated.    \"Try it,\" urged Anita.           *       *       *       *       *    We crouched where we thought we might be safe from Miko's fire. My  little light-beam shot up from the bowl. It was undoubtedly visible to  the camp.    \"_Yes? I am Haljan._\"    And I added:    \"_Help! Send us help._\"    I did not mention Anita. Miko could doubtless read these signals. And  in the camp they must have missed Anita by now. They answered:    \"_Cannot_--\"    I lost the rest of it. There came a flash from Miko's weapon. But it  gave us confidence. He could not reach us at the moment.    The Grantline beam repeated:    \"_Cannot come out. Portes broken. You cannot get in. Stay where you  are--an hour or two. We may be able to repair portes._\"    The portes were broken! Stay here an hour or two! But I could not hold  this position against Miko that long! Sooner or later he would find a  place from where he could sweep this bowl beyond possibility of our  hiding. I saw him running now, well beyond my range, to ferret out  another point of vantage.    I extinguished my light. What use was it to tell Grantline anything  further? Besides, my light was dangerous.    But the Grantline beam spelled another message:    \"_The brigand ship is coming! It will be here before we can get out to  you! No lights! We will try and hide our location._\"    And the signal-beam brought a last appeal to me:    \"_Miko and his men will divulge where we are. Unless you can stop  them_--\"    The beam vanished. The lights of the Grantline camp made a faint glow  that showed above the crater-edge. The glow died, as the camp now was  plunged into darkness.      CHAPTER XXVII    _Anita's Plan_    We crouched in the shadows, the Earthlight filtering down to us. The  skulking figure of Miko had vanished; but he was out there somewhere  on the crags I was sure, lurking, maneuvering to where he could strike  us with his ray. Anita's metal-gloved hand was on my arm; in my ear  diaphragm her voice sounded eager and unmistakable:    \"What was the signal, Gregg?\"    She could not read the semaphore lights. I told her.    \"Oh Gregg, the Martian ship coming!\"    Her mind clung to that as the most important thing. But not so myself.  To me there was only the realization that Anita was caught out here,  almost at the mercy of Miko's ray. Grantline's men could not get out  to help us, nor could I get Anita into the camp.    She added, \"Where do you suppose the ship is? In telescopic view?\"    \"Yes--twenty or thirty thousand miles up, probably.\"    The stars and the Earth were visible over us. Somewhere up there  disclosed by Grantline's instrument but not yet discernible to the  naked eye, Miko's reinforcements were hovering.    I stood up cautiously to try and locate Miko. Immediately I saw him.  He jumped as though fearing my coming bullet, and I dropped back,  barely avoiding his flash, which swept across the top of our bowl.    \"Gregg--Gregg, don't take such a chance!\"    We lay for a moment in silence. It was horribly nerve-straining. Miko  could be creeping up on us. Would he dare chance my sudden fire?  Creeping--or would he make a swift, unexpected rush?    The feeling that he was upon us abruptly swept me. I jumped to my  feet, against Anita's effort to hold me. But again Miko had vanished.  Where was he now?           *       *       *       *       *    I sank back. \"That ship will be here in a few hours.\"    I told her what Grantline's signal had suggested: the ship was  hovering overhead. It must be fairly close; for Grantline's telescope  had revealed its identity as a bandit flyer, unmarked by any of the  standard code-identification lights. It was doubtless too far away as  yet to have located the whereabouts of Grantline's camp. The Martian  brigands knew that we were in the vicinity of Archimedes, but no more  than that. Searching this glowing Moon surface, our little lights, the  tiny local semaphore beams we had momentarily been using, could easily  pass unnoticed.    But as the brigand ship approached now--dropping close to Archimedes  as it probably would--our danger was that Miko and his men would then  signal it, join it, and reveal the camp's location, and the brigand  attack would be upon us.    I told this now to Anita. \"The signal said, '_Unless you can stop  them_.'\"    It was an appeal to me. But how could I respond to it? What could I  do, alone out here with Anita, to cope with this enemy?    Anita made no comment.    I added, \"That ship will land near Archimedes I imagine, within an  hour or two! If Grantline"]]]
