Isn't Polly smart though, to bake like that!\" he added  admiringly.    \"I guess she is,\" said Ben, drawing himself up to his very tallest  dimensions. \"She knows how to do everything, Jasper King!\"    \"I should think she did,\" responded the boy quickly. \"I wish she was my  sister,\" he finished longingly.    \"Well, I don't,\" quickly replied Ben, \"for then she wouldn't be mine;  and I couldn't think of being without Polly! Was your father angry  about--about--'the gingerbread boy'?\" he asked timidly, trembling for an  answer.    \"Oh dear,\" cried Jasper, tumbling over on the grass, \"don't, don't! I  shan't be good for anything if you make me laugh! oh! wasn't it funny;\"  and he rolled over and over, shaking with glee.    \"Yes,\" said Ben, immensely relieved to find that no offence had been  taken. \"But she would send it; Polly tried not to have her, and she  most cried when Phronsie was so determined, cause she said your father  never'd let you come again--\"    \"Twas just lovely in Phronsie,\" said the boy, sitting up and wiping his  eyes, \"but oh it was so funny! you ought to have seen my father, Ben  Pepper.\"    \"Oh, then he was angry,\" cried Ben.    \"No indeed he wasn't!\" said Jasper; \"don't you think it! do you know it  did him lots of good, for he'd been feeling real badly that morning, he  hadn't eaten any breakfast, and when he saw that gingerbread boy--\"  here Jasper rolled over again with a peal of laughter--\"and heard the  message, he just put back his head, and he laughed--why, I never heard  him laugh as he did then! the room shook all over; and he ate a big  dinner, and all that afternoon he felt as good as could be. But he says  he's coming to see the little girl that baked it for him before we go  home.\"    Ben nearly tumbled over by the side of Jasper at these words--\"Coming to  see us!\" he gasped.    \"Yes,\" said Jasper, who had scarcely got over his own astonishment about  it, for if the roof had suddenly whisked off on to the church steeple,  he couldn't have been more amazed than when he heard his father say  cheerily: \"Well, Jasper my boy, I guess I shall have to drive over and  see your little girl, since she's been polite enough to bake me this,\"  pointing to the wild-looking \"gingerbread boy.\"    \"Come in and tell 'em about it,\" cried Ben, radiantly, picking up his  potatoes and salt. \"It's all right, Polly!\" he said in a jubilant voice,  \"for here's Jasper, and he'll tell you so himself.\"    \"Hush!\" said Jasper warningly, \"don't let Phronsie hear; well, here's  my pet now,\" and after bobbing lovingly to the others, with eyes beaming  over with fun, he caught up the little girl who was screaming--\"Oh,  here's Jasper! and my beyew-ti-ful doggie!\"    \"Now Phronsie,\" he cried, \"give me a kiss; you haven't any soft soap  to-day, have you? no; that's a good, nice one, now; your 'gingerbread  boy' was just splendid!\"    \"Did he eat it?\" asked the child in grave delight.    \"Well--no--he hasn't eaten it yet,\" said Jasper, smiling on the others;  \"he's keeping it to look at, Phronsie.\"    \"I should think so!\" groaned Polly.    \"Never mind, Polly,\" Ben whispered; \"Jasper's been a-tellin' me about  it; his father liked it--he did truly.\"    \"Oh!\" said Polly, \"I'm so glad!\"    \"He had eyes,\" said Phronsie, going back to the charms of the  \"gingerbread boy.\"    \"I know it,\" said Jasper admiringly; \"so he did.\"    \"Rather deep sunk, one of 'em was,\" muttered Ben.    \"And I'll bake you one, Jasper,\" said the child as he put her down; \"I  will very truly--some day.\"    \"Will you,\" smiled Jasper; \"well then,\" and there was a whispered  conference with Phronsie that somehow sent that damsel into a blissful  state of delight. And then while Phronsie monopolized Prince, Jasper  told them all about the reception of the parcel--how very dull and  forlorn he was feeling that morning, Prince and he shut up in-doors--and  how his father had had a miserable night, and had eaten scarcely no  breakfast, and just at this juncture there came a knock at the door,  \"and\" said Jasper, \"your parcel walked in, all dressed up in flowers!\"    \"They weren't our flowers,\" said Polly, honestly. \"Mrs. Blodgett put 'em  on.\"    \"Well she couldn't have, if you hadn't sent the parcel,\" said Jasper in  a tone of conviction.    Then he launched out into a description of how they opened the  package--Prince looking on, and begging for one of the cakes.    \"Oh, didn't you give him one?\" cried Polly at this. \"Good old Prince!\"    \"Yes I did,\" said Jasper, \"the biggest one of all.\"    \"The one I guess,\" interrupted Joel, \"with the big raisin on top.\"    Polly spoke up quickly to save any more remarks on Joel's part. \"Now  tell us about your father--and the 'gingerbread boy.'\"    So Jasper broke out with a merry laugh, into this part of the story,  and soon had them all in such a gale of merriment, that Phronsie stopped  playing out on the door-step with Prince, and came in to see what the  matter was.    \"Never mind,\" said Polly, trying to get her breath, just as Jasper was  relating how Mr. King set up the \"gingerbread boy\" on his writing table  before him, while he leaned back in his chair for a hearty laugh.    \"And to make it funnier still,\" said Jasper \"don't you think, a little  pen-wiper he has, made like a cap, hanging on the pen-rack above him,  tumbled off just at this very identical minute right on the head of the  'gingerbread boy,' and there it stuck!\"    \"Oh!\" they all screamed, \"if we could only have seen it.\"    \"What was it?\" asked Phronsie, pulling Polly's sleeve to make her hear.    So Jasper took her in his lap, and told how funny the \"gingerbread boy\"  looked with a cap on, and Phronsie clapped her hands, and laughed with  the rest, till the little old kitchen rang and rang again.    And then they had the baking! and Polly tied one of her mother's ample  aprons on Jasper, as Mrs. Pepper had left directions if he should come  while she was away; and he developed such a taste for cookery, and had  so many splendid improvements on the Peppers' simple ideas, that the  children thought it the most fortunate thing in the world that he came;  and one and all voted him a most charming companion.    \"You could cook a Thanksgiving dinner in this stove, just as easy as  not,\" said Jasper, putting into the oven something on a little cracked  plate that would have been a pie if there were any centre; but lacking  that necessary accompaniment, probably was a short-cake. \"Just as easy  as not,\" he repeated with emphasis, slamming the door, to give point to  his remarks.    \"No, you couldn't either,\" said Ben at the table with equal decision;  \"not a bit of it, Jasper King!\"    \"Why, Ben Pepper?\" asked Jasper, \"that oven's big enough! I should like  to know why not?\"    \"'Cause there isn't anything to cook,\" said Ben coolly, cutting out a  piece of dough for a jumble; \"we don't keep Thanksgiving.\"    \"Not keep Thanksgiving!\" said Jasper, standing quite still; \"never had a  Thanksgiving! well, I declare,\" and then he stopped again.    \"Yes,\" answered Ben; \"we had one once; 'twas last year--but that wasn't  much.\"    \"Well then,\" said Jasper, leaning over the table, \"I'll tell you what I  should think you'd do--try Christmas.\"    \"Oh, that's always worse,\" said Polly, setting down her rolling-pin to  think--which immediately rolled away by itself off from the table.    \"We never had a Christmas,\" said little Davie reflectively; \"what are  they like, Jasper?\"    Jasper sat quite still, and didn't reply to this question for a moment  or two.    To be among children who didn't like Thanksgiving, and who \"never  had seen a Christmas,\" and \"didn't know what it was like,\" was a new  revelation to him.    \"They hang up stockings,\" said Polly softly.    How many, many times she had begged her mother to try it for the younger  ones; but there was never anything to put in them, and the winters were  cold and hard, and the strictest economy only carried them through.    \"Oh!\" said little Phronsie in horror, \"are their feet in 'em, Polly?\"    \"No dear,\" said Polly; while Jasper instead of laughing, only stared.  Something requiring a deal of thought was passing through the boy's mind  just then. \"They shall have a Christmas!\" he muttered, \"I know father'll  let me.\" But he kept his thoughts to himself; and becoming his own gay,  kindly self, he explained and told to Phronsie and the others, so many  stories of past Christmases he had enjoyed, that the interest over the  baking soon dwindled away, until a horrible smell of something burning  brought them all to their senses.    \"Oh! the house is burning!\" cried Polly. \"Oh get a pail of water!\"    \"Tisn't either,\" said Jasper, snuffing wisely; \"oh! I know--I forgot all  about it--I do beg your pardon.\" And running to the stove, he knelt  down and drew out of the oven, a black, odorous mass, which with a  crest-fallen air he brought to Polly.    \"I'm no end sorry I made such a mess of it,\" he said, \"I meant it for  you.\"    \"Tisn't any matter,\" said Polly kindly.    \"And now do you go on,\" cried Joel and David both in the same breath,  \"all about the Tree, you know.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the others; \"if you're not tired, Jasper.\"    \"Oh, no,\" cried their accommodating friend, \"I love to tell about it;  only wait--let's help Polly clear up first.\"    So after all traces of the frolic had been tidied up, and made nice for  the mother's return, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27713"],[0,"The Elements of Bacteriological Technique (#20)"],[1," 1. A filament (b) grows upward, its termination becomes clubbed; on  the clubbed extremity flask-shaped cells appear--\"sterigmata\" (c).    2. At free end of each sterigma is formed an oval body--a spore or  \"gonidium\" (d), which, when ripe, is thrown off from the sterigma. Two  or more gonidia may be supported upon each sterigma.    _Penicillium_ (Fig. 79).--Note the branching filaments--\"mycelium\" (a)  (frequently containing globules).    Note the asexual reproduction.    1. A filament grows upward--\"goniodophore\" (b)--and its apex divides  up into several branches--\"basidia\" (c).    2. At the apex of each basidium a flask-shaped cell, \"sterigma\" (d),  appears.    3. At the apex of each sterigma appears a row of oval cells--\"spores\" or  \"conidia\" (e). These, when ripe, are cast off from the sterigmata.    [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Oidium.]    ~Ascomycetae.~--_Oidium_ (Fig. 80).--(This family is perhaps as nearly  related to the blastomycetes as it is to the hyphomycetes.)    Note the branching filaments--\"pseudomycelium\" (a). Here and there  filaments are broken up at their ends into oval or rod-shaped segments,  \"oidia,\" and behave as spores.    Note the asexual reproduction. From the pseudomycelium arise true hyphae  (b), each of which in turn ends in a chain of spores (c).      ~MORPHOLOGY OF THE BLASTOMYCETES.~    The blastomycetes are composed of spherical or oval cells (8 to 9.5 mu in  diameter), which, when rapidly multiplying by budding, may form a  spurious mycelium. A thin cell-wall encloses the granular protoplasm, in  which vacuoles and sometimes a nucleus may be noted. This latter is best  seen when stained with haematoxylin (see page 105).    During their growth and multiplication the blastomycetes split up  solutions containing sugar into alcohol and CO_{2}.    ~Saccharomyces~ (Fig. 81).--Note the round or oval cells of granular  protoplasm (a) containing solid particles and vacuoles (c), and  surrounded by a definite envelope.    ~Reproduction.~--Budding; ascospores--asexual.    Note the asexual _reproduction_.    1. \"Gemmation\"--that is, the budding out of daughter cells (b) from  various parts of the gradually enlarging mother cell. These are  eventually cast off and in turn become mother cells and form fresh  groups of buds.    [Illustration: FIG. 81.--Saccharomyces with ascospores.]    [Illustration: FIG. 82.--Torula.]    2. Spore formation--\"ascospores\" (e). These are formed at definite  temperatures and within well-defined periods; e. g., Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, thirty hours at 25 deg. to 37 deg. C., or ten days at  12 deg. C.    ~Torulae~ (Fig. 82).--Torulae, whilst resembling yeasts in almost  every other respect, never form endo-spores. Note the elongated,  sausage-shaped cells (a) the larger oval cells (b) and the globular  cells (c) the former two often interlacing and growing as a film.    Note the absence of ascospore formation.          IX. SCHIZOMYCETES.      ~Classification and Morphology.~--Bacteria are often classified, in  general terms, according to their life functions, into--        _Saprogenic_, or putrefactive bacteria;      _Zymogenic_, or fermentative bacteria;      _Pathogenic_, or disease-producing bacteria;    or according to their food requirements into--        _Prototrophic_, requiring no organic food (e. g., nitrifying bacteria);      _Metatrophic_, requiring organic food (e. g., saprophytes           and facultative parasites);      _Paratrophic_, requiring living food (obligate parasites);    or according to their metabolic products into--        _Chromogenic_, or pigment-producing bacteria;      _Photogenic_, or light-producing bacteria;      _Aerogenic_, or gas-producing bacteria;    and so on.    Such broad groupings as these have, however, but little practical value  when applied to the systematic study of the fission fungi.    On the other hand, no really scientific classification of the  schizomycetes has yet been drawn up, and the varying morphological  appearances of the members of the family are still utilised as a basis  for classification, as under--    ~1. Cocci.~ (Fig. 83).--Rounded or oval cells, subdivided according to the  arrangement of the individuals after fission, into--    _Diplococci_ and _Streptococci_, where division takes place in one plane  only, and the individuals remain attached (a) in pairs or (b) in  chains.    _Tetrads_, _Merismopedia_, or _Pediococci_, where division takes place  alternately in two planes at right angles to each other, and the  individuals remain attached in flat tablets of four, or its multiples.    [Illustration: FIG. 83.--Types of bacteria--cocci: 1, Diagram of sphere  indicating planes of fission; 2, diplococci; 3, streptococci; 4,  tetrads; 5, sarcinae; 6, staphylococci.]    _Sarcinae_, where division takes place in three planes successively,  and the individuals remain attached in cubical packets of eight and its  multiples.    [Illustration: FIG. 84.--Types of bacteria--bacilli, etc.: 1, Bacilli;  2, diplobacilli; 3 streptobacilli; 4, spirilla; 5, vibrios; 6,  spirochaetae.]    _Micrococci_ or _Staphylococci_, where division takes place in three  planes, but with no definite sequence; consequently the individuals  remain attached in pairs, short chains, plates of four, cubical packets  of eight, and irregular masses containing numerous cocci.    ~2. Bacilli~ (Fig. 84, 1 to 3).--Rod-shaped cells. A bacillus, however  short, can usually be distinguished from a coccus in that two sides are  parallel. Some bacilli after fission retain a characteristic arrangement  and may be spoken of as _Diplobacilli_ or _Streptobacilli_.    Leptothrix is a term that in the past has been loosely used to signify a  long thread, but is now restricted to such forms as belong to the  leptothriciae (_vide infra_).    ~3. Spirilla~ (Fig. 84, 4 to 6).--Curved and twisted filaments.  Classified, according to shape, into--        Spirillum.      Vibrio (comma).      Spirochaeta.    Many Spirochaetes appear to belong to the animal kingdom and are grouped  under protozoa; other organisms to which this name has been given are  undoubtedly bacteria.    Higher forms of bacteria are also met with, which possess the following  characteristics: They are attached, unbranched, filamentous forms,  showing--    (a) Differentiation between base and apex;    (b) Growth apparently apical;    (c) Exaggerated pleomorphism;    (d) \"Pseudo-branching\" from apposition of cells; and are classified  into--        1. Beggiotoa.    }   Free swimming forms, which      2. Thiothrix.    }   contain sulphur granules.        3. Crenothrix.   }      4. Cladothrix.   }  These forms do not contain      5. Leptothrix.   }  sulphur granules.        6. Streptothrix. A group which exhibits true but      not dichotomous branching, and contains some pathogenic      species.    The morphology of the same bacterium may vary greatly under different  conditions.    For example, under one set of conditions the examination of a pure  cultivation of a bacillus may show a short oval rod as the predominant  form, whilst another culture of the same bacillus, but grown under  different conditions, may consist almost entirely of long filaments or  threads. This variation in morphology is known as \"pleomorphism.\"    Some of the factors influencing pleomorphism are:    1. The composition, reaction, etc., of the _nutrient medium_ in which  the organism is growing.    2. _The atmosphere_ in which it is cultivated.    3. _The temperature_ at which it is incubated.    4. Exposure to or protection from _light_.    The various points in the anatomy morphology and physiology of bacteria  upon which stress is laid in the following pages should be studied as  closely as is possible in preparations of the micro-organisms named in  connection with each.      ~ANATOMY.~    1. _Capsule_ (Fig. 85, b).--A gelatinous envelope (probably akin to  mucin in composition) surrounding each individual organism, and  preventing absolute contact between any two. In some species the capsule  (e. g., B. pneumoniae) is well marked, but it cannot be demonstrated in  all. In very well marked cases of gelatinisation of the cell wall, the  individual cells are cemented together in a coherent mass, to which the  term \"zoogloea\" is applied (e. g., Streptococcus mesenteroides). In  some species colouring matter or ferric oxide is stored in the capsule.    2. _Cell Wall_ (Fig. 85, c).--A protective differentiation of the  outer layer of the cell protoplasm; difficult to demonstrate, but  treatment with iodine or salt solution sometimes causes shrinkage of the  cell contents--\"plasmolysis\"--and so renders the cell wall apparent (_e.  g._, B. megatherium) in the manner shown in figure 85. Stained bacilli,  when examined with the polarising microscope, often show a doubly  refractile cell wall (e. g., B. tuberculosis and B. anthracis).    In some of the higher bacteria the cell wall exhibits this  differentiation to a marked degree and forms a hard sheath within which  the cell protoplasm is freely movable; and during the process of  reproduction the cell protoplasm may be extruded, leaving the empty tube  unaltered in shape.    [Illustration: FIG. 85.--Dragrammatic sketch of composite bacterium to  illustrate details of anatomical structure.]    [Illustration: FIG. 86.--Plasmolysis.]    3. _Cell Contents._--Protoplasm (mycoprotein) contains a high percentage  of nitrogen, but is said to differ from proteid in that it is not  precipitated by C_{2}H_{6}O. It is usually homogeneous in  appearance--sometimes granular--and may contain oil globules or sap  vacuoles (Fig. 85, d), chromatin granules, and even sulphur granules.  Sap vacuoles must be distinguished from spores, on the one hand, and the  vacuolated appearance due to plasmolysis, on the other.    The cell contents may sometimes be differentiated into a parietal layer,  and a central body (e. g., beggiotoa) when stained by haematoxylin.    4. _Nucleus._--This"]]]
